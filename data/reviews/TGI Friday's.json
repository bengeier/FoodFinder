{"text":"I can't believe I'd give this place a 5-star rating, but I have to share a great experience.  ...so I ended up with a $50 gift card for TGIF and was a bit hesitant to take my 6-person family there during a Friday evening (since U of I was on break at the time, we went for it).  Service was PHENOMENAL.  Yes, even from a Friday's!  They gave all the kids 2-3 balloons and gave us just the right amount of attention to be comfortable.  We celebrated my kid's birthday, so they gave her an extra big sundae with plenty of spoons... perfect!  Food is what we expected and all around tasty.  The kids' menu ribs, mac & cheese, and burgers were gobbled up very quickly even by the picky eaters.  This review might be influenced by us having a gift card and being there during a break, but I'm giving this a thumbs up."}
{"text":"TGIF used to be the BUSINESS. I remember way back when when they had the tower of wings and they had some bomb wings that tasted like the miso but better (or maybe they were the miso wings back then) either way..I liked the miso wings better than the buffalo wings. I know I'm picky with my buffalo sauce but this one had a strong bitter flavor to it. My friend enjoyed the buffalo wings but personally I didn't eat a full wing because it wasn't that tasty to me. I ordered the cajun chicken and shrimp, it was surprisingly pretty tasty. Had enough kick for me not to add hot sauce. My friend ordered the fajitas which came in a pretty decent size order."}
{"text":"The food is always great, so is the service. My only complaint is the personal conversations we listen to while we were waiting for food, one of the waitress was talking to the cook about her dad smokes weed every day and wants to learn it in Spanish, and about an inappropriate guy that is \"so fine\".  Give me a break, and keep your personal stories away from customers, we don't want to hear it"}
{"text":"The last visit I had here was fantastic!!! Our server was nice and paid close attention to what we wanted and was sure to refilling our beverages, he was even great about the coupon we had. I think he was probably one of the best server's I've ever had. I wish I could remember his name, but he was great!"}
{"text":"So my buddy thought it would be a good idea to go here after he saw the commercials for endless appetizers. Finally we end up going after a solid workout session and they made them endless for a reason.. They taste cheap and are not even worth the $12 that they are. And to top it off when it came time to pay I gave the waiter my card and he charge it on someone else's tab. It was 8 o'clock on a Tuesday, the place was practically empty. Not okay."}
{"text":"With coupon and gift card in hand, we ventured to this chain restaurant for a Monday afternoon lunch.  Hubby had the Jack Daniels steak with cheddar mashed potatoes, while I munched on fish & chips.  All in all, not too bad.  Add to that a couple of side salads and a couple of drinks and our bill was over $25.00 (even with the buy one, get one free coupon).  Certainly not what we were expecting.  The hostess who showed us to our table was polite, but definitely devoid of personality.  Oh, how I miss the days of meaningless small talk & professionalism!  Our server was very attentive and actually did an above-average job.    If this particular location wasn't so darn convenient for us, we probably would have gone somewhere else.  But, optimistic as we may be, our thought was an early-bird style lunch on a Monday -  would be much better.  Will we return? Maybe. Would we recommend?  I don't know. We still kinda prefer the Mom&Pop restaurants and supporting our community."}
{"text":"I ate lunch here today with my daughter and the food was great.  Nicole was our server and the service was excellent!"}
{"text":"So I finally tried Fridays,NEVER AGAIN!My husband and I wanted to go w/ our kids to Pappadeux but the wait was 45 minutes and as any parent knows,that is agony having to wait that long with 2 hungry children.SO since Fridays is next door and we had never been before we head over.We were seated right away and got our drinks quickly,my husband ordered a Jack and Coke which was all Jack with barely any pop in it.Now my husband likes drink but his was waaay too strong he had to ask for a plain coke just to balance it out.                     For our entree's I ordered the petite filet and salmon.I asked for my filet to be cooked medium rare,what I got was a fully cooked excuse for meat.I took 2 bites and had to spit out the the 3rd,I couldn't take it anymore.The salmon was overcooked and had no flavor.         My husband ordered the Friday signature cheese burger,he ordered it well done and it was still really pink in the middle.Now normally we would have sent it back but after seeing one of the waitresses giving another customer major attitude,about her food not being cooked right and then complaining that it tasted funny when she got it back we decided not to risk it.Overall the service was okay but the food made me wish I had stayed home and had a bowl of Cocoa Puffs.Next time you see a sign for T.G.I Fridays step on the gas and get away as fast your car will take you!"}
{"text":"Super slow service, I'm talking snail pace and this is on a Wednesday night.  Seems like a lot of teenagers running the place, too busy giggling in the back to let us pay our bill. Not that I ever expect much at a chain restaurant."}
{"text":"I went here a few nights ago to celebrate my friend's 21st birthday with a group of 10 people. It was about 9pm on a Saturday and the place was pretty empty, only a few other tables with people in the entire place. Furthermore, there seemed to be an abundance of staff on hand, most of them just mulling around or talking to each other at the bar. So I was confused why my friend's long island iced tea took nearly 15 minutes to be served, and this was before we had ordered any food. The arrival of our food was the second disappointment of the night. The mountains of food shown in the menu's pictures turned out to be barely filling portions. The best example of this was one of my friend's pasta dishes. In the photo it looked like two meals on one plate, and he even asked the waitress if it was a lot of food, to which she responded that it was, and he might even need a take-home box. When it came there wasn't even enough to fill the entire bowl, literally 1/5 of it was white space. Talk about bad presentation! At least spread it around to make it look like we're getting our money's worth. On top of that there was way fewer vegetables and shrimp served than what was shown. Needless to say, he finished it but still went home hungry. Another brief example, another friend's steak was outright pathetic in size, but he said it at least tasted alright, and they did give him enough filler vegetable and mashed potatoes to fill the plate. After our meal I was running late for another party so I asked the waitress to bring my birthday friend one of their alcoholic milkshakes and to bring my bill. I watched the milkshake sit at the bar for over 5 minutes as the mulling staff talked over it, breathing countless germs into it, before they noticed and put the accoutrement on it and served it. Meanwhile I waited for my bill for nearly 15 minutes before I had to stand up and walk over to ask the waitress for my check again, because they had stopped paying attention to our table. She came over right away with everyone's check, leaving me wonder why I had bothered asking for it specially earlier. This is all on top of the ridiculous prices they charge. I do not understand the reviews that say 'reasonable prices'. Yes, the food is usually pretty tasty, but it is very overpriced. Almost $8 for 6 mozzarella sticks? $15 for a small steak? $8 for mixed drinks with maybe 2 shots in them (and not even mixed well)? Bad values all around. Not a problem specific to this location, but a flaw nonetheless. Why would you choose T.G.I. Friday's when there are way better deals all around you?"}
{"text":"The only reason I give this place any stars is because of the bar and Sunday package. The restaurant is always empty when I visit. It's probably because of that old woman that roams around the place cackling at you while you eat."}
{"text":"Never go here. This place is not good! The wait was long to get our food and when we got the pecan crusted salad it was mushy!Our lobster tail was raw. The bathrooms weren't too clean either. Our server was good though and very nice. A man who looked like  the manager  actually had to come over a few times to apologize and help us. By the time we were about to leave even though we had ordered another burger we didn't really want to eat it. We were just out with this place."}
{"text":"I have been to this TGIF at least 10 times with my wife, and I will be coming back. The waiters are always attentive, the food is really delicious, especially their sirloins. The prices are also very reasonable. I like the atmosphere of this restaurant a lot, and the wall decorations are very cool. I would recommend it to my friends."}
{"text":"Service was timely, friendly and knowledgable. Food was, as always, very well made. Friday's will always be one of my top 5 restaurants to dine at. Still curious why so many locations here in the valley closed but the remaining are exceptional."}
{"text":"This place is terrible.  Ordered two draft beers.. the sat at the bar for five minutes befor our server ever got around to bringing them to our table.  Ordered queso dip and chips, as well as flat bread.  All cold.  Our first clue this place was crappy was the hugh rip in the booth seat. ( and the huge rip in the booth seat in the next booth as well)  This place is bacically a waffle house that serves beer.  Dont waste you time.  Walk across the street to Chili's and you'll feel like you've up graded to a 5 star restaurant compaired to this place."}
{"text":"After a 10 min wait outside,  Friday 6:55 PM entered the restaurant. Ordered 7:05 PM. Orders came out way past 7:40 PM. The manager was going around apologizing for delays. We couldn't leave till 8:30 PM.   Our server \"Chad\" was not paying attention and making mistakes that could be avoided.  He brought out a french onion soup instead of clam chowder after the 35+ min wait.  We ate: The portions were small but the quality was above average.  We gave a coupon to Chad.  Chad: \"Seperate checks or all together?\" us: 3 seperate checks please. Chad: Together, got it. us: We'd like to split the check between 3 parties please.  He processed our bill and came back. The coupon was not applied so we flagged him down again.  Chad: \"How was everything guys? Food come out in a timely manner? (dead silence)  Well you're one of the lucky ones\" he said.  No, No, and No. Just because we weren't more vocal like the other customers doesn't mean we were one of the \"lucky\" ones.  Then he came back. The coupon was applied but he had forgotten 2 of our credit cards. He looked through his apron smock thingy and pulled out the other two credit cards. \"Wow, that looks bad doesn't it?\" he said. No comment, dead silence.  He came back with the receipts and one pen... which didn't work at all. At this point, we decided to procure another pen on our own and just sign and tip and get out of there.  I had a bad experience and it was rather disappointing. Would not go back for a long time."}
{"text":"UH-OHHH I HAVE A BAD BAD FEELING THIS ONE IS CLOSED TOO!!  We always come here, often once a week and the food and service is excellent. We always come around 11am to 3pm and it seems those Yelpers who've had a bad experience go later into the evening.  I was looking on the TGI Fridays official website for the address to the Happy Valley location and noticed  this one on Tatum is no longer listed. Very bad sign. I called their number and get the phone company creepy dee-dee-deeeee tone with the automated message that the phone number is no  longer in service. But I was just there, how could this be??!!  Actually I'm not surprised. I always went to the Friday's on Bell Rd and was shocked when I was there one week and the next week it was suddenly closed totally out of the blue. It was always packed, even during the day, so it made no sense. I mentioned this to the server at Tatum and she said it wasn't because the Bell Rd location wasn't successful, it was because the owner couldn't pay the rent any longer at that location nor at 2 other locations. And he'd done the employees dirty as well. The employees had no clue. One day the owner had them all moving their restaurant equipment to other locations, including the Tatum one. She said the employees were all chattering happily because they were sure it meant they were getting all new stuff. Then after everything was moved the owner tells them the bad news.  She said the owner owns this Tatum location and the Happy Valley one as well, but they had no worries, the same couldn't happen to them, because the property was owned not rented at both locations. I remember thinking, \"Great, if he is that lowdown a jerk to pull what he did at the other locations, what would stop him from just selling this location at no notice to the employees.\" I have a sad feeling that's exactly what happened.  So, it looks like only the Happy Valley and downtown Phoenix locations remain. She said the guy owns the Happy Valley place so I doubt that will be around much longer. Don't know if he operates the downtown one as well...hope not.  R.I.P. Fridays...your cheese-sticks are the best, the grocery store version is gross, but the ones at  your restaurants are mm-mmm-MMMM!"}
{"text":"Service was friendly and efficient. Nice enough bar area. Had a hamburger that left much to be desired. If you do not want food, it's a good enough spot to park. However, only if you have not eaten would I recommend ordering something, and even then, not much."}
{"text":"blllaaaaah I tried the pretzels, wings, sliders, and spinach tip. I ate a bite of everything and I was done with it. everything tastes like it's all frozen microwaved food. i will probably not be back. I'm glad that everything was at least half off."}
{"text":"Waited ten minutes for drink order to be taken. Then were told we had to wait because the kitchen was backed up. Then had to wait another 20 mins for check. Food was okay."}
{"text":"This was not gourmet dining but the food was tasty and nicely prepared!  The manager was vigilant about keeping customers happy.  I just ate there a week ago and was shocked to see it had closed.  I  also recenly learned the Friday's in Phoenix as well as Surprise has closed.  I will miss the Glendale Friday's."}
{"text":"Fun place to come for Happy Hour. The mozarella sticks are awesome and they have a good variety on the happy hour menu. The inside of TGI Fridays is not the greatest and can feel a little dark and dingy at times. But overall its ain't too bad."}
{"text":"went to this location a few months ago with the hubby and kiddos,when we walked in the hostess snubbed us since we came in an hour before closing Im guessing! But anyways I gave this place 1 star because I couldnt give it 0, My husband ordered a steak and it was so full of gristle, fat and nerves that on his second bite he started to choke,I totally freaked out and he tried to drink some water and it couldnt go down his throat so he threw it up all over his plate and food,now the steak slipped down a bit so he could breath but it was still lodged there so he was in alot of pain and he kept trowing up.anyways the waitresses were just standing around watching the whole time and after the worst was over they came over and were like are you ok? to my husband.....no im not ok and i need to go to the hospital! the waitress was like ok and she actually went and got our CHECK! like are you kidding me? we just got our food and took a few bites and my hubby chokes on the food you served him and now you want us to pay for it before we rush to the hospital? so the hubby and kids went to the car and I was so mad I just paid and ran out...no manager no nothing. got hubbs to the er and they had to give him some shot to let the steak pass through this throat...you could actually see the lump in his throat! needless to say we wrote a letter to the corporate office and what did they do? oh they sent us a letter saying sorry! will never go here again.......EVER!"}
{"text":"So this is a busy Thursday afternwork and we come in with a group of 10 all reared and ready to get some half price happy hour appetizers. Unfortunately the half price apps are only available in the bar area. And the bar. Sadly was full.   We did our best to work our way into the bar but to no avail. Just when we were ready to throw in the towel the manager offered for us to get the half price apps but be able to sit at a table. We all rejoiced for the great fortune and awesome service and luck. The bartender was nothing but sweet and the food just tasted that much better  I went with the sriracha wings. Awesome. Also with the southwest quesadilla. Also good. I mean food is food. But service can't be imitated no matter how good your chef is. That is why it's 5"}
{"text":"Best meal we've ever had. Got the jack Daniels ribs and the hibachi chicken skewers. Mark was our waiter and he was absolutely awesome. Would come back to this Fridays any day !"}
{"text":"So service HORRIBLE, we are sitting a this booth for 20 min until someone finally comes and ask if we have been help we say NO and he says ok and leaves we thought he was gonna help us but mo he got a waitress and she came over 10 min later.  She takes our drink order and appetizer and before we can say no wait we are ready to order... she is gone. Takes about another 10 min to cone out with tea and water, we get our order in, but when it comes our it feels and tastes li k e it has been seating out for a while or a refund heated plate. Overall I didn't like it, service was not prompt, they were not nice and the food was plain no flavor. No WOW factor to make us go back ever AGAIN!"}
{"text":"The photos on the menu go beyond missleading. On entering a host seated the two of us in a booth meant for five. Drooping one set of silverware on the table, he slouched off without a word. The server took drink orders. She dropped waters off mid march like the table was a Forrest fire, no lemon.  On ordering steak and lobster, both distinctly tasted frozen and microwaved. The steak was lukewarm. The lobster was cool. The fries were unseasoned and cold. It seemed my order was sat in the window for some time. The steak lacked any salt and was drenched in butter. The lobster was charred dry and crunched sickeningly.  As a line cook in a french kitchen, this lack of pride in service and mishandling of entrees was appalling. I payed fifty dollars to eat this  meal. I would pay more to forget it ever happened."}
{"text":"Compared to other TGI Fridays, this one has the best decorations.  When you enter, you see a gigantic poster on a wall full of wacky and artistically placed quotes.    I forgot to mention that some of the staff were outside greeting guests, which was very welcoming.  They also had awesome teamwork when another waiter served our drinks.  Our main waiter was rather slow and just friendly enough, but to her defense she was pregnant.  The Zen chicken potstickers hit the spot.  It was neither too greasy or \"too American\" (considering this wasn't a Chinese restaurant).  I loved the mixture of spices in the chicken topped off with the soy sauce dip.  Order a Mai Tai for a truly fruity, yummy drink.  Another friend ordered the Lava Flow, and we swore we felt like these drinks were from Hawaii!!  Mmm, mmm, good!!"}
{"text":"I was hesitant to come here, but it is super close to my fiance's work so we decided to go. I ordered a side salad and my fiance and I split an appetizer of nachos. They were really salty and just... well, not good. My salad was fine, but I had asked the waitress to put the dressing on the side, and instead it was slathered everywhere. We also split a burger, which was decent, but very very heavy. I think I maybe had 3 bites of it. My partner also ordered a drink special- a Long Island Iced Tea that came back to us blue! They said it was the \"Illini\" special, though I have no idea how seeing how our colors are orange and blue and not light bluish green... Bottom Line: Save your money and support a local restaurant instead!"}
{"text":"Wings, burgers, chicken,  French fries.   Yeah yeah yeah, we've seen this a billion times in the valley of the Sun.  Another chain restaurant with standard, dull American food."}
{"text":"One star is one too many in my opinion. We ate there for the first time tonight, being new to the area. NEVER AGAIN! We were greeted by an unhappy host at the front who gave us a booth for my husband, me and 4 small kids. My youngest - less than a year old - was asleep in her car seat/stroller which he saw me come in with. I wheeled it up to the table and he said to me, \"Can you move that?\" Ok, \"THAT\" is my daughter. Then when I looked at him about to ask if we could move to a table instead he said, \"It's a fire hazard\" (presumably referring to the stroller next to the table), and he walked away.   Next up for our enjoyment was our waitress. Ms. No Personality. She walked to the table without a smile, asked for our drinks. When we asked her about the \"kids eat free\" promo she seemed a little irritated. She left and about 15 minutes later came back and said, \"still haven't decided?\"  - in a snarky tone. We had, we were waiting for her. We ordered. We waited, and waited and waited for our food. I think it's worth noting at this point that we were 1 of maybe 5 parties in the ENTIRE restaurant. She finally comes out with the food, my 3 little ones about to have a meltdown by now. Never apologizes. Instead, she comes out with a helper who is carrying out all the plates, and the waitress marches up to our table without saying a word and starts handing ME the plates to dole out to the appropriate person. I was passing down kid meals, burgers, mac 'n cheese - one after the other. OK, isn't this HER job??? Then she hands my 7 year old a hot platter of ribs. He almost drops it on his lap and I scream, \"Isn't that HOT???\" to which she replies with attitude \"NO! It isn't hot.\" Which, is a problem too - since, if it's food coming out of the grill should it not be hot???  I was miffed at this point. My husband came back to the table, who had been walking our weary 2 year old outside since the wait was so long, and told him I would no longer be looking at the waitress for fear of saying something I should not.  She checked on us two times, asked if we wanted dessert and that was the end of it. She should have not received any tip - but we did leave a small one.  As I was leaving she was at the hostess stand - leaning on it, talking with the hostess - who was standing there picking at her nails. I walked right by them - neither one said \"thanks\" or \"have a good night\".   I will NEVER in a thousand years spend my hard earned money at that dive again. I was so disappointed. I've been going to TGI Friday's for years and it was always a fun and happy and upbeat place. I don't know what that was that I visited tonight. I do know I will not be back. I see, from the other reviews, I'm not alone in my opinion."}
{"text":"Great salmon. Tough chewy bland steaks.  $40 worth of steaks returned (2 were tough and unpleasant), what did they give us?  A $5 desert.  Gee, thanks!  Won't be back.  Too many good restaurants in the area."}
{"text":"So last night, myself and some friends stopped by to check out the endless appetizers promotion they have going on. We managed to clear 4 rounds before the fifth destroyed us! But while we were there, we were assisted my the head honcho manager himself! The staff went way out of their way to please us. By offering to have our next round started while we just received the previous one, and providing us a heavenly assortment of sauces. Our drinks never seemed to run low, and the food was always hot, and cooked very well and flavorful. The only downside was one round of mozzarella sticks could have used another minute or two in the fryer, other than that, our service was phenomenal! I will definitely recommend this restaurant to my other friends, and encourage everyone to go pig out hardcore over the endless assortment of foods that will beckon your name. I myself will be revisiting again, both for the food, and to see that gorgeous hostess again! #TGIF"}
{"text":"This place SUCKED!!! Went here for happy hr, had high hopes because I use to love TGI Fridays. Our drinks were so weak, MAYBE a 1/2 shot in a long island. The food was just ok, noting great. I emailed Fridays and told them of our experience and they basically said 'Sorry it sucked.' That's it. With all the choices we have in the area you'd think they'd want our business. I guess not. I will not be going back."}
{"text":"WOW!  Crap-O!  We have gone to other TGI Fridays in the past and had a much better experience.  Stopped in here on our way back from a weekend trip.  Tried to go to a neighboring restaurant, but did not want to wait 45 minutes.  Low and behold we were able to get right in at TGIF!  I guess that should have been our first red flag!!  We were seated right away and our server took drink orders and apps order.  We ordered the Green Bean Fries - these were pretty good, but not as good as the ones at PF Changs.  I ordered the Dragon Fire Salmon, which comes with rice pilaf and broccoli.  My wife ordered the TGIF Shrimp, which comes with fries and all you can eat shrimp.  When our meals arrived, my plate looked like a garbage pile!  You know, like when you watch a cooking show and they keep throwing the scraps onto a pile somewhere on the side...Well, that was my plate!  A messy pile up of rice, broccoli, and salmon!  What a mess.  I had to deconstruct the pile of garbage before I could begin eating.  When the waitress asked how it was, and I told her the truth, she seemed to not really care at all.  Then the manager was making the butt-kissing rounds and asked how things were.  I repeated my minor complaint to her, and she just sort of shrugged and said \"thanks\" while she walked away.  Messy presentation aside, the salmon was pretty good.  The rest was ok.  My wife's meal was nothing special and she practically had to beg for the refill of shrimp.  Worst part, though, was the waitress.  Her name was Stephanie.  VERY inattentive to customers.  Took eons for her to notice we needed drink refills. Took forever to get the bill, as well.  Next booth over was luckier - they had a server named Jessica and she was super attentive and made me feel jealous that I was not seated in her section!  Overall we will NEVER eat here again!  No way, no how!"}
{"text":"This review is just for drinks. The food sucks, but they have decent drink specials. Come to the bar after you've eaten somewhere else and watch the sun city crowd sing karaoke."}
{"text":"Worst food ever!!! Went in tonight for happy hour.  We ordered a couple of beers and two appetizers. The first appetizer was the spinach dip.  It was horrible.  Has zero taste and we were given stale chips.  Then we ordered the spicy chicken sliders.  What a joke.   These are literally a crappy slider bun with a deep fried chicken tender and a tiny splash of store bought hot sauce.  So awful.  We ate one out the four and the waiter asked if we wanted I box.  I told them no and that they sucked to which he ignored and just got our check.  What a waste of $27 dollars.  I'm grossed out and hungry all at the same time."}
{"text":"We loved this place a few years ago, but great food is on the menu but exiting the kitchen. Both of us here and I eat alone."}
{"text":"We stop in Friday's every few weeks for Happy Hour. They have great beer and food specials during happy hour. Discounted drinks and half priced appetizers are a plus! The staff is always friendly and provides prompt service. This place is not super busy and the people are normally very laid back. It's not a very social environment."}
{"text":"Came here for Christmas dinner with my mother. Big mistake. 7 o'clock and they were packed! I couldn't believe it. We waited 20 mins for a table (which we didn't mind, we were in no rush). After getting our drinks, we ordered some guacamole and chips as our appetizer. We waited and waited, finally, like 20 minutes later watery guacamole (it looked like pea soup) and the WORST tortilla chips came out. The chips were so stale we couldn't finish our one bite they were also soaked in grease. We spit it out and told our waitress. She brought us new chips that were not much better, but edible. We kept the soupy guac, as we hated to complain...they were so busy we just blew that off. I got the bruschetta chicken pasta but asked for shrimp instead of chicken. I don't do dairy, so asked for no cheese. Waitress said no problem. Mom got a ribeye steak and shrimp with sweet potato fries. The food came after 35 minutes. My pasta with extra cheese. Ugh...and 4 of the rawest shrimp sitting on top. Sent it back because I can't eat cheese. Waitress brought a new one without cheese. I like my shrimp well done, or at least cooked to a healthy and safe temp. She brought the new pasta, it was ice cold. Then she took back the shrimp and left the pasta! So the cold pasta was left to get even colder while they fixed the shrimp. Then when she brought the shrimp they had to microwave my dinner to get it hot again...resulting in it being dryer than dry. Ekkk. Moms steak was served in a pool of butter and grease. Literally. She used all the napkins at the table to sop it all up. Some of her fries were wet and mushy from the butter. And the shrimp was missing from her plate! After asking several times they finally brought it. Nothing special. Just shrimp. We used a coupon buy one get on free. They charged us 6$ for my four raw shrimp. It was ridiculous. Yes, it was Christmas, but really? This experience should have been better. Even for Christmas night. I don't think we will be back."}
{"text":"We've been there a couple of times over the past year. Same result both times. Burger was over cooked and still somehow cold. Service was very slow. The experience was so bad, I complained on TGIF website and got an email from the manager saying they wanted to contact me so they could give me a coupon. I told them forget it, that I had zero interest in ever returning, even for free food. I completely agree with the other reviewers that say this is the worst place in Surprise. Perhaps the only restaurant in town that is totally off limits for us."}
{"text":"Good happy hour specials, staff friendly, should warn you when you order too much food, had left overs for all 6 of us"}
{"text":"Had a nice dinner but when it came to pay the waiter brought our book with receipt we put are cash in the book but then told him we had a coupon. He took the book with our cash in it then brought it back with adjusted receipt and no cash. He says there was no cash in the book. I myself put 20.00 and my girlfriend put 25.00. Don't know how this could've happened but there are too many people handling other checks. Obviously our waiter needed the money. I will never return to TGIF. This is just another reason why they've been closing. Bad service, high prices, and theft. Beware of this bartender bald guy with tatoos he's a thief!"}
{"text":"I love this Fridays.  The service is always amazing and so is the food.  They make really good drinks as well.  I really love their wings, they are so good!  Happy hour is good and we always can get a table in the bar for it."}
{"text":"Worst experience ever , it was the only restaurant without a wait and now I know why. Service was incredibly slow and an hour after ordering we still had not received our food and there was no manager or wait staff to be found. Took another 20 minutes to pay for our drinks and Express our disservice to unapologetic manger. We will not be going back"}
{"text":"Stopped in for a light dinner and was HUGELY disappointed. We waited 15 minutes for the waiter to come to our table, 10 minutes to get our drinks and have our food order taken, and then when we got the \"gourmet\" Mac & Cheese. It looked like vomit on a dirty plate and had dry chicken on top. Tried to talk to a manager but they couldn't be bothered so we walked out. Never going back."}
{"text":"Today, our office decided to get TGI Fridays for lunch. We opened the website and the first thing we saw was the Lunch Pairings option. We decided this was a great deal so each employee wrote their order and we sent someone to order and pick up.  When she ordered, they were very rude and told her that that option was dine in only and made her feel badly about making an exception. Please note that it does not state \"dine in only\" on the website for this special, and its not much different than the same thing Applebee's and Chili's does- and they allow to-go. Also, its listed on a website- not an in-store menu. 2 people chose an option from the $8.99 price- on your website listed as Cajun Chicken Pasta. When our food got back to the office, we were pretty surprised to see that the \"Cajun Chicken Pasta\" consisted of mostly noodles, a couple pieces of SHRIMP (???) and a couple pieces of chicken. When I called the location to find out about the shrimp, I was spoken to as if I was stupid. I was informed that \"all of our pastas are shrimp and chicken\" and that we should have ordered it without shrimp. Which I would have, since I'm allergic. However, HOW WOULD WE KNOW THERE WAS SHRIMP IN A CAJUN CHICKEN PASTA?? The manager I spoke with did not seem interested in fixing the problem- just arguing about what the menu says. When I finally told him that I am allergic and not willing to die just to eat my $10 lunch (which is about $1.50 worth of sauce and noodles) and would they like to refund the money or replace the food, he said he would remake the entrees without shrimp, and we could pick them up.  You should probably update your website to reflect what the stores says, or train your stores to know what the website says- including disclaimers on deals not available TO-GO and fully listing the product and ingredients. Shrimp and shellfish is not an uncommon allergy and should be noted on any dish containing it. And maybe teach your staff and managers how to not be rude to customers."}
{"text":"I've been going to Friday's for 35 years. The food is always good as is the service. The menu has changed over the years but it never disappoints. I recommend the whiskey cake for dessert."}
{"text":"I refuse to go to TGI Friday's in Champaign anymore. I've been here around 4 times, and it's just not worth it. For the price, there are lots of other places to get a good meal in the area. I'm very forgiving when it comes to service. I know that servers and waitstaff have a demanding job, and I tip well even for mediocre service. However, truly bad service is inexcusable. I came with a couple of friends and ordered a frozen margarita. When my drink was brought out, the server spilled the entire drink all over me. This isn't what bothers me. At another restaurant I'd be totally willing to forgive and forget. It happens. Her reaction was what soured the experience. She gave me a half-hearted, insincere apology and brought me out two extra napkins. Mind you, the full drink was all over my lap and running down my leg - not a two-napkin fix. I asked for more napkins, and it took a couple minutes, but she did come back. She offered to make a new drink, but I told her to forget it and bring me an iced tea. She did, and the meal was fine. The food is alright, but nothing spectacular. I had a cheeseburger and fries, and it was pretty good. I liked the fried green bean appetizer with wasabi ranch sauce quite a bit. The real shock came at the end of the meal. We had separate checks, and not only was I never offered a discount or compensation for the server's mistake, but she tried to charge me for the margarita! I've had waiters slip up elsewhere, and while I don't think it's necessary to offer a discount, it sure is appreciated, especially when I've spent nearly an hour eating my meal and covered in sticky, cold margarita, through no fault of my own. A manager eventually came over to speak with me about the bill, and he ended up comping our appetizer and my iced tea. Still, the server's poor attitude ruined what could have been a pleasant evening out. I won't be back."}
{"text":"Meh... took 20 minutes to bring us water and a brownie sundae."}
{"text":"I have to tell you that I love T.G. I. Fridays.  The food is great...especially their Jack Daniel's grilled selections....  ...but this location has the worst service of any food chain in the northwest valley.  I drive across to the Friday's at 59th Avenue and Bell so that I can have someone actually come see that I am there within 20 minutes, maybe take my order and refill my drink once or twice...."}
{"text":"If you are looking for breakfast past customs and security, there are two options it seems...and Friday's is the only one that has waiter service.  Since I was lugging along carry on bags, I really wasn't in the mood to try and balance a tray of breakfast food as well, especially at this rude hour.  So Friday's it was.  The food here, well, you know.  Friday's.  The breakfast options are somewhat limited, I had the breakfast wrap with hash browns and fresh fruit.  It was filling, the portion was large.  But nothing special.  From previous experiences here, I know that the service can sometimes be spotty, so if you are in a bit of a hurry to catch your flight, make sure you flag down your server to ask for your check well ahead of departure, it sometimes takes them awhile to get back to you."}
{"text":"The food was very delicious and fresh, however, the first server we had sucked! We talked to the manager he gave us an amazing waitress and free dessert. So all in all it was an ok dinner. The manager there cares about his customers satisfaction."}
{"text":"Closed."}
{"text":"Ick. Surprised this location has not been closed. There is seldom anyone there, the food is terrible and smells like dirty wet towels when you first walk in. Attention health dept, time for a spot check."}
{"text":"I have a hard time reviewing a place without bias when the customer service sucks right from the beginning. It was date night so I tried not to make a fuss but after seeing the damn commercials for a week advertising $10 rack of ribs we were ready to get down to some serious grubbing! We were seated and ordered drinks. Later when it was time to order our entrée we were informed the sale price for ribs would not be honored at their restaurant- no further explanation aside from they don't participate. No accommodation, no discount, no nothing. I think if you are a restaurant that relies on commercials to drive customer visits you should probably honor the deals being advertised."}
{"text":"Cajun  chicken and shrimp pasta is to die for. Service is ok. I've came over and over again for their pasta!!"}
{"text":"Wow! Was going to write a thorough review and it was not a positive one, sad to say.  I guess they saw it coming; I drove by and see THE BUILDING HAD BEEN TORN DOWN at this location....(In Surprise, W. Bell Road)"}
{"text":"It's been over a year since I wrote the original post, so I figured it's about time for an update.   Don't sit in the dining room if you don't have kids. Seriously. The bartenders are just too good; most will do whatever it takes to make you a return customer- which is exactly what my husband and I are.  The happy hour is ALL DAY SUNDAY! Plus 9-C every other day. Their wings are really good, especially grilled. I was going to Native New Yorker for wings, which you can't beat the selection of sauces, but their size wings were just sad. TGIF's is a chain, but has down to earth and friendly bartenders.   If something is wrong with your meal, they WANT to know. They will fix it too, when it rarely happens. I've never had a waiter ask me to cut into my steak in front of him to make sure it's good before I eat it- but Matt makes sure I do every time so if it's wrong, he'll get it fixed asap. Never had that happen, but I still appreciate his attention to that detail.   Sign up for their rewards too; my hubby and I get a free meal (like steak!) with about every 5 times we visit. Can't beat that!"}
{"text":"This location has a very tiny patio & the patio has a beatle (err.. cockroach) problem.  Althought the waitress was very forthcoming with this information and urged us to go inside to eat & drink.  She blamed the pest problem on the ditch right next to the restaurant.  I might just wait until i get back to surprise next time."}
{"text":"I have been here 5 times (which is 4 times too many) with my wife and kids and have been thoroughly disappointed EVERY time. There has not been a time where I've ordered something and they either didn't have it, or it was horrible.  How this place remains open as part of the chain is a mystery to me. At least the service is half decent, unlike the food they serve."}
{"text":"Their service was above acceptable, but kind of slow. It was Wednesday night around 9pm and only one section in the restaurant was open for just a few groups. Their business looked very slow there. But I suppose it was a probably typical week night situation."}
{"text":"All I can say is , never again. Bus boy brought my husbands beer after whispering and pointing with the blonde hostess . Anyways it started out with us walking in , the blonde hostess was very rude and threw the menu in front of me . After that my daughters hamburger was undercooked & it turns out no child's burger should ever be undercooked , we even asked for well done. After that , I ordered chicken pasta , but yet gave me shrimp & chicken , the chicken turned out to be raw on the inside and I had all ready ate most of the chicken before finding out. Now I'm waiting to see If me and my daughter will turn out sick . :( . The managers did attend to us & gave us the meal free. The only good thing was the very kind waitress . Never coming here again. Do not come here . I feel like the hostess was out to get us. Terrible experience."}
{"text":"Me and a friend of mine frequent this place a few times a month. We always sit out back on the little patio and enjoy the weather. We usually go on Friday nights and this place is always dead. I would not recommend going here if you are looking to socialize or party it up at the bar. I like that about it though. We can sit on the patio, chit chat and enjoy our food and not be bothered.   We usually get half priced appetizers for happy hour and a few drinks. It ends up being pretty cheap. I love the nachos! They are really good here and they put lots of crap on top and don't skimp!   Couple of negatives...service tends to be really slooooow on occasion. We went here last Friday and our server only came out twice and we had to hunt him down to get our check and then another 15 mins later when he never came out to grab the card to run. (he was pretty cute though and apologized, so all was forgiven!) Other bad thing is on the rare occasion when there are other people on the patio, it gets kind of awkward because the placement of the tables are so close.   Other than those few little issues, I really like going here to grab a bite and hang out."}
{"text":"I used to think TGI Friday's was a step ahead of Chili's and Applebee's, sadly it is not. Or atleast, not anymore...  Everything tasted microwaved, old and/or left out under the heat lamp... which strangely reminded me of the movie 'Shanatagans\", so we were a little nervous about complaining to the waiter (Luke) or god forbid make him return it to the kitchen.   We asked how everything was cooked, and he said the fish and steak were grilled and the vegetables were steamed. Kinda strange since everything was really not that good. Nice guy, but would have been nicer if he partially comped the meal for tasting so blah for $40. Could of just stayed at home and made some tv dinners, it's that sad. I'd say this place is barely passing at C-."}
{"text":"Not a shining moment on this night of the NCAA championship for TGIF. 1. More Menu deception: The 474 menu does have some items at $4 or $7, but the fine print reads, \"Starting at...\", so we are left with most of the items at a higher price point. Since my last visit, their menu's have gotten even more confusing. 2. Bartender, who looked like an out of place manager, seemed kinda upset after I called him out on a few things, like not knowing what channel the NCAA title game was on or the fact that there wasn't a happy Hour menu (it was right there on bar). 3. The half price appetizers were mostly bad. The mozzarella sticks were undercooked and underwhelming and the pretzels looked better than they tasted. 4. Small TV sets and one TV set which was blurry and no volume for the game. Things did get better though when we left."}
{"text":"Ok this is sad, but this has honestly become one of my usual N. Scottsdale spots due to the awesome late night and happy hour specials.  The happy hour is awesome - both food and drinks - and their jack daniels strips are great.  I would also recommend the brucetta chicken pasta and the sizzling chicken plate something or other.  Just - uh - dont go there for the \"ambiance\"  its TGI Fridays for gods sake - hence the 3 stars  Surprisingly, they make a not so bad mojito (ask for Jessica - best bartender they've got by far).  Happy hunting"}
{"text":"Had steak and lobster it was great. was well seasoned. Potato skins were kind of suspect but they were good would possibly go again"}
{"text":"The foods not bad. But if you can't find a place to sit in the bar you're outta luck for happy hour. Which I find it ironic at a place called thank God it's Friday!"}
{"text":"The food at Friday's is a much better quality than the other similar type chains."}
{"text":"Absolutely the best fried chicken in town.  The only problem is that they serve it only on Sunday.  We have very limited places in Champaign that serve good fried chicken.  No Popeye's, no Church's and the chicken they serve at KFC is really fried pigeon, just the worst.  The wait staff is extremely friendly and the place is always clean.  This place has real good food."}
{"text":"I I had the French dip and it was wonderful also had the French onion soup that was good the waiter was fantastic everything was just perfect"}
{"text":"Placed a corporate order to go for lunch for four today.    They don't seem to have an online system of ordering. I had to arrive 30 minutes before lunch, place the order and then sit there waiting for it.   Everyone seemed to enjoy the flavor of their lunches but they were ALL loaded into the to-go bags upside down, so it was pretty messy.   My lunch, French Dip, was missing the dip. That really changed the sandwich, unfortunately. It wasn't too busy today so there should've been no excuses.   Very disappointing to serve my boss such a mess. Doubt if I will use TGIF for corporate lunches again."}
{"text":"I like fridays the food is pretty decent I obviously order what I like to eat haven't been going back here lately though wanted to try new food but Ive been to this location a good 50 times great waiters. The bathrooms smell like septic drives me nuts and the water is scalding hot too."}
{"text":"Heavy mixed drinks... just the way I like it.  (hmm... I'm seeing an alcohol theme to my reviews lately)  Service was pretty good and friendly... I was hanging out in the bar with my sister... I haven't actually dined here."}
{"text":"Can't help but like the place.  I haven't been to this location in a while, but I've never had issues with service or anything and this guy this last time... he was BEGGING for a good tip with his behavior (he was AWESOME... thanks Matt).  BTW... American Express employees... you get a discount. :)"}
{"text":"Never did pay us the money they owed us for our fundraiser and karma finally caught up with them. This location is CLOSED PERMANENTLY! good riddance to poor customer service and sub-par food."}
{"text":"very little to complain about with TGI Fridays.  i am always able to get an item that is no longer on the menu (blackened Cajun chicken sandwich) and the menu is constantly changing.  Always worth a visit a few times a month."}
{"text":"For the prices of a burger, I would expect that they taste...good. These were mediocre at best. The side of veggies we got instead of fries were overlooked and mushy. My \"squash\" ended up being a lemon peel! I remembered why we stopped eating here many moons ago."}
{"text":"I love the staff here. They are super nice. I love the fried green beans app. Its amazing. I always get the chicken strips but my guy gets the Jack Daniels stuff. He loves it.  And let not forget about there new cookie dessert. Yum!"}
{"text":"Yuck, yuck, yuck & yuck. Had a $50 gift card and went here with my sister and we were not impressed. Service was slow, despite being two of very few customers. Food was terrible- I could have bought better frozen food and cooked it in my oven. With so many great places to eat in Surprise, I am not sure how this location is still in business! Used the rest of my gift card with some friends in Chandler and had a totally different experience."}
{"text":"Went here a month or two ago with my boyfriend. Drinks were nice and strong, and our jack daniels ribs and chicken were delicious! The only thing we weren't fans of, was the potato skins. Stay away from those. Also our server was a bit \"odd\", but that didn't stop her from giving good service"}
{"text":"This was a great place. First time my husband and I have been here and we will definitely go out of our way to go again."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying my waitress Patty Ann was good. My son also enjoyed his Jack Daniels Ribs. But that is all the good I can say about this place..I ordered the chicken caesar salad and it arrived with a grilled lemon on the side. I didn't think anything of it until I tried the salad and it may as well have had lemon dish soap on it. VERY lemony and sweet. Not at all what a caesar salad should taste like. The chicken was grilled and ok. The waitress took it back and told me that she would have them make me a new one without the lemon. It took FOREVER for my new lunch to come out and my son was already done with his lunch.   The second salad tasted exactly like the first one albeit without the grilled lemon wedge on the side. Very overwhelming lemon taste.   The manager did come over and say that he tasted my salad and it was how they normally serve it. I told him that I had never tasted a caesar salad that tasted like LEMON .. he said well we are different here and walked away. He did take the salad off the bill (I did eat the chicken on a separate plate). JUST BE AWARE IF YOU ORDER THE SALAD, their normal dressing contains LEMON and a LOT of it.   After a non-lunch and a bill of $32.00 without my lunch added in. I don't think I will be coming back. It is sad that such a long standing franchise just can't compete. There are MANY other options here at the Happy Valley Towne Center. DON'T MAKE THE MISTAKE OF EATING HERE."}
{"text":"The best part of the meal was our server, she was friendly and attentive.  The food was pathetic.  Ordered potato skins and each one had a few crumbs of bacon and a pinch of cheese, about the size of a quarter on each.   My  friend ordered the spinach dip and it was good, but I was still disappointed looking at my potato skins sitting there so lonely and naked...Sat near the window, big mistake, it was so hot!"}
{"text":"Good food, happy hour is cheap.  They managed to screw up my salad 2x in a row now, but overall great experience, bartenders are friendly, and it never seems to be busy even on a Friday evening."}
{"text":"Came here because of all the 2 for $10 ads with the delectable, mouthwatering cheeseburgers and queso dip.  I was disappointed to find out that this TGI Fridays didn't have the 2 for $10 on their menu (as if it was a hidden menu) and they didn't offer all of the deals that were on the 2 for $10 ad on the TGI Friday's website.  There was a very limited selection which was disappointing.  Looking through the menu, the average price of meals ranged $18-$24.  When TGI Fridays become a fine dining restaurant? Luckily we were able to order off the 2 for $20 menu and I didn't feel ripped off, but I can't imagine choosing to pay full price and have dinner at TGI Fridays when there are so many BETTER, Fresher, NICER choices of restaurants in that price range."}
{"text":"The table across from us dined and dashed. The restaurant is making the server pay. That's no bueno! I'm not sure if that wasn't a ploy by the server to get sympathy dollars added to her tip.  I normally don't dine at TGI unless I'm dragged kicking and screaming. But the wife was jonsing for the Pretzel and cheese on the 1/2 off appetizer menu. So being a nice guy I said \"okay lets go to TGI Friday's tonight\".The pretzel was awesome by the way. And I would highly recommend it.  I like their ribs. It's about the only thing on the menu that I do like. They are meaty and delicious. They have special deals during Sunday football."}
{"text":"I came around 9pm with my bf after getting off work. We walked in the door and stood at the host podium for a few minutes looking around waiting for someone to greet us. It took a little before I caught who I think was the manager's eye and he said we could seat ourselves in the bar or he could seat us at a table. After we sat ourselves the bartender came and he was very personable and pleasant and pointed out the happy hour menu. I was impressed with their late night happy hour and ordered a $5 Ultimate Electric Lemonade. When the drink came out I was happy it was a decent size. My bf got the wings and said they were good also. Long story short, points knocked off for bad first impression but the food was good and timely, and late night happy hour will make me a return customer."}
{"text":"It has been a year since I was last here. The service was excellent, far superior from my last experience. New menu, lots of options. Service and food was great tonight!"}
{"text":"1 star given because they are not accommodating. Went there with family and requested a booth for 3 ppl. Young kid at the host stand said he can give us a half booth. Despite All the booths to the right being empty so I looked at him and he said that area was closed despite someone else dining in one of the booths.  Took us to the bar area with a gloomy half booth which I declined. I stating my displeasure with their seating arrangements and I clearly said we were going to Olive Garden which was next door. Needless to say we went to Oliver Garden where they did accommodate us with a real booth. Will never go back to TGIF's or at least this one. They don't mind losing customers to competitors and aren't accommodating. Management needs to wake up! I can spend my money elsewhere."}
{"text":"Got here at 8:30p, ordered at 9pm, still waiting for my food.  Staff is messing around, watching TV, chatting with friends, etc.   Stay clear of this place. I have never seen a TGI Friday's run so horribly!!!"}
{"text":"I have visited this restaraunt many times in the past couple years, every time I visit the happy hour menu changes ( for the worst). I used to enjoy dining in this restaraunt when the prices stayed the same as well as selection. i have also noticed a lot of the usual employees that I liked to see have either been fired or quit over the past 8 or 9 months. I am not happy with the service of the new employees or the price of h.h, I will no longer be visiting this establishment because of these reasons, I would advice no one to dine there as well,,,,,used to be a fun familiar place now it is a place where I am uncomfortable and my wallet is a lot lighter!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I said let's go somewhere else but I wasnt buying so I had no choice. Ahhhh TGIF on a Saturday night about 8pm not too bad we got right in w a party of 4 +2 kid's. Our server Morgan did a great job considering the kids bothering her every min and my hub being a complete jerk. He was kidding but not everyone knows his humor and usually its not very funny. If I was his waiter I'd be pissed luckily my generous friend made up for her hassle in the tip.   Food is consistently good here I have been maybe 3x all not my choice. Eagc time has been a pain free experience. The men seem to like the meat in the Jack Daniels sauce. I tried the Ahi Tuna burger's they are cute little burgers it came w some salad and some funky sauce that wasnt too memorable. See pics. Great place to take picky kids they will even serve them baby ribs can you feel the excitement of how fun this could be!?!?!"}
{"text":"This was my 3rd time being at this restaurant and I must say all 3 times this place was awful. I used to love Fridays and not sure what happened but it's awful now at this location. The server was good but oblivious to what I was trying to complain about in regards to food. The mozzarella sticks tasted like chalk and had a bad taste to them. I ordered chicken tenders and fries and those came out chalky and gross. I tried to tell that to the server and she just smiled and said ok. I paid the check and left the whole food there because I didn't eat any of it. The fries were also bad as well. I will not be coming back again. 3 strikes and you are out with me"}
{"text":"Host/Server: Jordan was great. Thank you Jordon for everything and for being our Host. Dined with my new roommate and was nice to have lunch out there to get to know one another. Perfect casual place."}
{"text":"This was the first time I had ever been to a T.G.I Friday's and it was excellent. The queso appetizer left something to be desired and could use a little more seasoning, My Jack Daniels burger was AMAZING it was juicy and fresh and just all around awesome especially with the sweet potato fries. Our server was awesome as well. Will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"I ordered two ribeye steaks, med-rare, baked potatoes.  The steaks were not rare, they were raw. The potatoes were not even cooked, hard as a rock. One potato was the size of a lemon, the other was a huge baker. The manager was not apologetic and flip, and advised we were free to drive back down to the restaurant to have it re-cooked. We had ordered it to go, so driving back to the restaurant I've miles at eight pm, didn't sound like a great plan.  The attitude from Jason the manager just added insult to injury.  The dessert and salad were great."}
{"text":"Wow! I love the 2 for $20 deal. You get so much food!! Great Happy Hour specials! Chris and Jared are amazing bartenders, who never let you go thirsty!  Wow! I love the 2 for $20 deal. You get so much food!! Great Happy Hour specials! Chris and Jared are amazing bartenders, who never let you go thirsty!"}
{"text":"I would like to start off with that the food was excellent I loved the Jack Daniels burger that I ordered what I wasn't satisfied with the service that was provided I asked for a refill on my drink which took over 30 minutes to get we had to ask him not once but three times for the refill then he finally decided to bring me my drink after having refilled my wives twice the value was decent for the amount of food that you are given in the quality I've never had a problem at Fridays before as I've always been provided awesome service so it might I've been just this waiter but I am judging my review off this visit so 3 stars is my stand."}
{"text":"Another 3.5 rounded to 4  No one really cares about TGIAPPLECHILIS do they?  This is better then Chilis, on par with Applebees but not near as good as outback.   Decent prices decent food decent service."}
{"text":"I wish I understood from what brain abnormality I suffer that leads me to keep returning to TGIF.  We ordered take out last night, i had the 'prime rib' Stroganoff and my wife had the 5 cheese macaroni.  I've eaten microwave meals that tasted better and what 'chef' employs lasagna noodles for anything but lasagna?  For $9.99, it was barely edible and my wife's mac and cheese turned out to be grilled chicken topped in with some bacobit/blue cheese obscenity; hell not even the wings were that good and they're usually the best part.  How do they get away with charging people money for this? Because morons like me continue to eat there. In all honesty, my wife and I had were very tired and hungry and TGIF was a block away.  Next time, I'll jump in the car and take my chances with one of those re-fried hot dogs at the local 7Eleven."}
{"text":"They don't even deserve one star...  we walked in and there wasn't even a hostess the servers were seating people. We asked for a booth and she said no I can't provide great service to you there. We said no to bar seating and she said well I have a half booth which are only in the bar... so we said okay to a table... the same server that sat us was to be our server and when she sat us she didn't ask for our drinks or anything... we sat there for 20 minutes at least without a server not even looking at us... and we decided to get up and leave and just go next door to Olive Garden like everyone else does..."}
{"text":"Went there for lunch yesterday ordered the Stacked Burger. It was bland, only had thousand island dressing in the center of the bun (similar to McDonald's burgers), my bacon was dry and very hard. My husband ordered the Smoked Stacked Burger. His burger had a little more flavor thanks to the bbq sauce other than than worthless burger. The fries were hot and fresh (good save). The only good thing about our experience was our waitress, Alexis. She was very kind, always had our drinks full and just an awesome person. 2 stars for food, 5 stars for service."}
{"text":"I've been to this location a few times but last night was the WORST service I've had at a restaurant in a very long time. We got here a little before reverse happy hour so we waited to order food and drinks until 9pm. Our waitress barely came to our table to check on us and the place was pretty dead. We ordered our food at 9:10, got our pot stickers appetizer at 9:45pm. I ordered a sangria and it took about 20 minutes for it to come out. Our friends couldn't get a refill on water and iced tea to save their life...the list goes on and on here. All of our entrees were cold and tasted like they had been re-heated and sitting under a heat lamp for a while. Really not appetizing and we all left hungry. When we asked to speak to the manager, she offered us a \"free\" dessert and after 30 minutes of waiting, we walked over to the hostess stand and waited to speak to her again. At this point, we didn't even want the dessert or anything to do with the place. Oh, and on top of everything, the place was FREEZING!! Yes that sounds great in the summer but it was unbearably cold. Overall, this is a very poorly run restaurant with very poor service. We were comped the food and offered a couple coupons but I am certain I will never come back here!!"}
{"text":"Food was good here. Service was a little slow for the afternoon. Waitress was helpful with the alternative sides and changes for Gluten sensitive. Staff wasn't really too friendly."}
{"text":"5 stars for the Bar Tenders at Fridays Happy Valley.   I've never had a bad experience at the bar top here, quick food service and excellent drinks. Chris and Marty are my go to guys.  Treat your bar tender with respect they will respond two fold. Never leave you unattended when you need something and will even stop by just to chat you up to see how things are going. Good place to start the night or grab something to eat before calling it.  Managers come and go pretty quick in this place, says somethings about the employees that stick around."}
{"text":"Our server Eddie is a Sharks fan so how can this be a bad meal.   We flew in for game and the sharks beat the Coyotes.....  The food was great and they open till midnight.  Good times."}
{"text":"Ugh. Tonight was very disappointing. I get that there was a full house. I get that it was the dinner rush. But by the time we were seated to the time we were greeted? 45+ minutes. Like what? We only noticed no one has even said hello to us until we were basically done with our conversation. We only ordered water and even that took some time to get to us. I think our server was Monica? I don't think she was bad but probably just trying way too hard for an impression. Well, we ordered and I was trying to add cajun shrimp at the last minute and she basically just talked over me... she didn't write down that I wanted to add it. To myself, I knew my food would come out without it but I wanted to give her the benefit of the doubt. Food did take some time to arrive but it was hot, so no big. But no shrimp so I had to ask again for that. I was just about done with my meal before it even came out... so yeah, that wasn't even worth the $6 extra for 6 pieces. My lady's food was actually not hot. It had cooled down before it made it to our table. My steak was ordered medium-well. It came out medium. She ordered well-done, it came out medium-well. I guess that's how it was working tonight. We didn't bother sending them back because we were hungry and we could deal with it. Parts of my steak were even rare. Yeah, not good at all. Our waitress saw us probably 1.5 times after we got our food. My water was empty the entire time. There was no refill. There was no check up until it was time for the check. Took less than 6 minutes for her to come back and get my credit card... hm. Nice. I did not want to tip her, however, understood the food couldn't be all her fault and I know they don't get paid a whole lot. I gave what I Thought was fair for the service we received. But I don't think I've ever regretted an $80 meal before. If we come back, it's probably not going to be for a long while."}
{"text":"This place deserves 0 stars! I'm actually sitting here in the booth here while writing this, I'm so angry. Started off good, then half way through our meal the server just totally ignored us. Empty beverage cups as she walked by 5 times and helped the table next to us. When she finally came back. We ordered more drinks and a dessert and a cup of coffee. She must be a total airhead, she set the cup of coffee in front of my two year old, while I was loading my to go box. So obviously he grabbed it and spilled it all over himself and the floor. I was freaking out, and good thing they gave us cold f-ing coffee. No I'm sorry, no is your son ok, do you want another coffee... nothing. Then after they cleaned it up, I heard her say in he back \"well, what the f*ck do you want me to do?\"... how about get a new career. Choose a different place where they won't put your children in danger."}
{"text":"Happy Hour was fabulous. Amber was our waitress and was awesome!! We can't wait to go back!!!"}
{"text":"Having 1 billion things on your menu doesn't make you a good restaurant.  I really have no idea why they have so many things...unless it is really just the same 8 basic ingredients reformatted for each entry.  But still, it hurts my head just to open the menu.  So I ordered the first picture i saw that looked appetizing - Fish Tacos.  Unfortunately, they ruined what would have probably been an awesome fish taco by leaving the fish in the fryer about 3 minutes too long.  There's nothing like a hard, dry, dark crunchy breading on dried out fish to make you think twice about ever ordering fish tacos again.  But there was an awesome sauce in a little cup on the plate - a  southwest style, hint of lime and cilantro dressing.  Delicious.  But our waiter sucked.  He actually yawned while repeating our order.  I mean, Come On.  I should have left him a $1 and told him to get some sleep."}
{"text":"You know those bundles of ads you get in the mail every week on Tuesday and Wednesday? That's the place to look before you head out to TGI Friday's. The last few times I've looked through these ads Friday's has had a BOGO FREE coupon in that bundle of ads. That's the only way I would go to Friday's.   The food isn't bad, it's just okay for the price and if I'm going to spend $50-$60 bucks for a meal it isn't going to be at Friday's.  Yesterday we wanted a quick lunch and this location is just down the street in horrible maze referred to as Desert Ridge. Typical Saturday with lots of SUVs headed to Target for diapers and paper towels. Unfortunately no matter how many times you visit Desert Ridge Marketplace you'll never figure out how to get in or out without becoming a prisoner of the parking lot.  Oh sorry, this is about Friday's. So we make it to the restaurant unscathed and are promptly seated. Our friendly server came by right away and took our drink order. After taking a few minutes to peruse the menu my partner decided on Tuscan Shrimp Pasta and I ordered the Dragonfire Salmon. The salmon normally comes with a Kung Pao sauce and unless you like an overly sweet sauce covering up perfectly good salmon ask for it on the side like I did. It's much better that way.   The pasta was good as was the salmon. Everything came out quickly and the our drinks were never empty. For $28 plus tip it wasn't a bad deal since we had the coupon. Call me old, but I would have been disappointed if I paid full price.  All in all, not a bad experience."}
{"text":"Food is OK, Service is not the best even on a day when its not crowded."}
{"text":"You know when you go on vacations...you try to check out the local places and restaurants...right? Well, don't ask me why the other parties on my vacation trip wanted to go safe and dine here. And worse, on New Year's Eve!!!!   And on New Year's Eve, this place was pretty much quiet with few tables occupied.  So, waitservice was friendly and attentive.  Despite my disappointment with hanging here on New Year's Eve, food was surprisingly good.  Hey, anything with Jack Daniel's in the food is bound to make it delicious!  If only TGIF wasn't so dark inside, everything would have been just right.  Turn up the lights a bit.  Not all of us are hideous looking, ya know."}
{"text":"Listen no one comes to Friday's expecting great food BUT the bartenders are my FAV. Andre and heather are so awesome and the beer is cold and in front of my super fast. No complaints!"}
{"text":"I come here pretty often and always usually order the same thing. The Jack Daniels dinner with two meats and two sides. My boyfriend and I each order a steak and mashed potatoes. It's filling and generally good."}
{"text":"We were seated in the bar, waiter took our order and I gave him the Stripes #. After other people delivered the food we never saw him again. I stopped a bar tender passing by and asked if we could get the ranch dressing we ordered. The fries were old, cold, tough so I stopped another gal and asked if we could have something else since they were not edible. No one checked back to see if we were ok. Finally about 20 minutes after we were done eating I stopped the bar tender again and said we had waited a very long time for the bill and whatever happened to our initial server. With professional polish she said they worked as a team and got the bill for us. The bill was wrong as we were charged for the chips and salsa plus my Stripes number was not on it. She handed it off to some other guy who said he would fix it. He only brought back the credit receipt to be signed and I asked him where the receipt showing my account number was, he then brought back a small slip of paper stating how many stripes I had. It looked like the same amount I already had. Anyway, what a fiasco!!! The really troubling part was that the staff was saying how dead it was in there, no business, and when we left there were at least 5 staff standing around talking at the hostess station and one of them said basically thank you and have a nice day. I would have to think long and hard about going back to that Fridays. Some one should have had the courtesy to say the waiter was leaving for whatever reason and that we are handed off to someone else. The bar tender could only say that she was sorry that we fell through the cracks. Really? Slow business day and we were lost to the staff? I think of how patiently we waited before I flagged someone down and now I feel like an idiot. We asked where other TGIFriday's were located and basically there were only two left, the others were closed down by the owner is what a waiter said. Sad, because I really love the service and Jack Daniel's ribs that I get when in California, but Arizona has gone very astray."}
{"text":"Fast service, attentive waiter, food cooked as I ordered, clean restrooms...What more could I ask for? I was on my way to a meeting at the Marriott so I stopped in to grab lunch beforehand. I was in an out in less than 45 minutes. Perfect.  I'll be back the next time I am at the Desert Ridge mall looking for a place to grab a quickbite to eat without ordering fast food."}
{"text":"Wow- I ordered a Cheeseburger in the two for 10 deal. The patty was obviously direct from the freezer, very low quality. Not even up to the level of Dairy Queen and certainly not In-N-Out caliber. It's was really bad. I ate half of that slimy mess and asked for the check.   My wife had a Chicken sandwich for $9 and change that was roughly the size of a slider.   The service was decent. The atmosphere is good, but it's a restaurant, right? I wasn't looking for gourmet, but I did expect something that was at least edible.   I have eaten at various TGIF's several times and always felt that were decent. Not amazing, but for corporate food, they were all right. I am not sure how TGIF franchises work. Perhaps the one in Chandler makes their own decisions about portions and food quality. I can't speak to that.   I hope that they do improve, but I doubt very much I will ever be back to find out."}
{"text":"I received a ton of gift cards to tgifridays... unfortunately, this is the location closest to me. The food @ this one has been mediocre and frequently incorrect. Even wrote in to their corporate office once and received a voucher for $8- pretty sad state if I don't even want to use it.  Other locations have not inspired this feeling in me. Its like this one just doesn't care."}
{"text":"The whole experience was alright. Waiter was kind, but he kept forgetting about requests that we'd ask for such as bringing ranch, never offered refills, and our food took too long to come out. We did the always endless appetizers and had to wait 30 minutes to get our second refill of appetizers. Afterwards the manager was aware of the service that we had received and he came up to us telling us that that was going to be our waiters last night, implying that he was to be fired. We all thought this was completely unprofessional. We were given discounts on our food, but regardless I will not be returning to this restaurant."}
{"text":"Food is awesome, service is great! My husband and I randomly came here one night because it had been years and we come back all the time now. This restaurant easily outdoes its neighbors!"}
{"text":"Had steak and lobster !  Surprisingly great stuff didn't know TGIF even had this on the menu! Fantastic!!!"}
{"text":"I rarely get food,  but the happy hour specials draw me in at least once a week.  20 ounce draft beers,  including good beer (ie. not bud,  coors or miller),  for $3...  Great price for me."}
{"text":"It's no wonder there are only 2 left, I'm sure most people are wisely going elsewhere.  I ordered the French dip and was very disappointed. The aju was good, but super tiny sandwich.   Wife liked her burger, mainly the Jack Daniels sauce.  Son had American stacked burger and halfway ate it.  Overall, service was okay, food was so so, but way over priced.  I will not come here again."}
{"text":"I have always been a fan of TGI Fridays, but this location is ruining that for me. For some reason the food here is just not the same as other Friday's locations. Be cautious."}
{"text":"Finally made it out there again with a $25 gift card. Steak and lobster time for this lady. Hubby had ribs and shrimp and we shared our sides, sweet potato fries, ginger lime coleslaw, and the tomato mozzarella salad.   My steak was very juicy and tender and the lobster was pretty good too. My husband's ribs were also very flavorful and cooked just right.   They do however need to work on their sides. The coleslaw didn't taste like lime or ginger and was kind of soggy. The tomato mozzarella salad needs some type of dressing, I suggest balsamic vinegar. The sweet potato fries are good- I really like those."}
{"text":"Can in for dinner and drinks after work. Sat in the bar area at around 9:30. There were not many people there and now I know why. The service was terrible. The guy behind the bar took almost 15 mins just to get the first drink, then never came back for us to place the app. Once we have flagged him down for the chicken strip app, it he spent the next 10 mins watching tv. We told him what he wanted for dinner (chicken and shrimp) but he failed to write it down so we just got an extra app. Not a dinner! When it came out we explained that was not what we had ordered and there was no apology. Nothing. I just asked for the bill and we left. Stay away on Sunday nights!"}
{"text":"The last time I went to TGI Friday's was about five years ago and it was great!   I went yesterday with my fiancée, his brother, sister and mom and I can definitely say...I've had better! I ordered the Buffalo chicken sandwich and the first thing I noticed is that the chicken was extremely dry. If there is one thing I dislike it's dry chicken. I got past the fact that it was dry, but still wasn't very satisfied. The one thing that really got me mad was that my soon to be mother in-law ordered the pecan salmon and they were out. Now we were there at around 2pm \"lunch time\". Having worked in many kitchens, the one thing that's key is that you never want to run out of a featured item let alone at lunch time. Saying this..... it also means they will be out for dinner as well. She did choose another item off the menu but waited ten minutes after everyone else had already gotten their food.   Other than that the service was on par. The atmosphere was nice and the company was even better."}
{"text":"Not really a fan of this place, decided to go because my friend and seen a 2 for 1 deal which was an entree and an appetizer or dessert for $10. So we thought why not. I had a house salad, and the chicken brushetta pasta. The chicken on the the pasta was not fresh tasted like cardboard. Will not be going back."}
{"text":"Well I forgot I had posted that it was closed. I managed to get them to come back to Champaign, IL They are now located up by the Market Place Mall. The store is a lot bigger, and their new crew is fantastic !  The  food is. Well... What can you say......ITS FRIDAYS........Order the Jack Daniels ribs. You won't be disappointed !"}
{"text":"Casual restaurant seems to have been mistaken as a requirement on the staff, not the customers.   In a far from full restaurant.  Long time to get from door to seat, from seat to drink, from drink to appetizer.The inferno wings are a cruel , dry and salty joke.  Less heat than a jalapeno and drier a Stephen Fry observation given at midday in death valley.     We both had the same 8oz steak, well one of us may have had because one was frigging tiny.  I seriously feel like punching myself in the gut because we paid the same here as we did at Fresh Wasabi in Glendale the day prior. http://www.yelp.com/biz/fresh-wasabi-glendale"}
{"text":"Great place!  Sign up for their stripes rewards before coming and you'll receive a free appetizer or desert. Jarrod was our server and he surely didn't disappoint. He was tentative and brought us our drinks right away. We drive an hour to come to this location because the atmosphere is amazing, the waiters are friendly, and the food is great! Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Went here due to the mailer we received for BOGO. We ordered the Jack Daniels ribs, steak and shrimp, and wings to start us off. The food was good and the service was acceptable. Nothing really stood out as excellent, and I don't see us returning anytime soon. I would agree with Scott that the service is at times \"lacking\", but we didn't choke on any steak so I think somewhere between 2-3 stars is right."}
{"text":"Service was efficient, especially for an airport eatery, but the food was just okay. There are not enough places to eat (or should I say decent places to eat) in this airport, so this was really our only breakfast option for hot food at that time of the morning. Good service, bleh food."}
{"text":"Friday's food has always been consistent, but my first time at this location wasn't great. The food was fine, but our table was dark, we had to ask for utensils, they put onions on my salad when I asked for it without, and it smelled. It's that grease trap smell and we kept getting whiffs of it throughout dinner. Blech! Also, as with many places, they don't list their beer-on-tap prices. Fine, but the waiter should at least know what they are when we ask."}
{"text":"The food is ok. Much better than Chili's and Applebees.   I don't eat at these style places often, but it turns out this one is near my work. I was very middle-of-the-road on eating there till I tried their Crispy Chicken Sandwich, as it is pretty good.  The service is always pretty good, and they are never too busy at lunch time, which is when I go. I had been going about once a week, sometimes with a co-worker.  Then why the two stars, you may ask,  Because this place opens at 11, for lunch.   Lunch breaks are generally thirty minutes, or an hour. When a place says they open at 11, and want the \"lunch crowd\" then you better be on time.  The last two times I went there, I arrived at 11am, on the dot.   The first time they opened late, I though it was a fluke, and no worries.  The second time I went there for lunch I arrived at 11am, on the dot. One employee was getting dropped off for work, so it was obvious there was a paying customer.  I waited....11:05....11:10.....11:15....door wasn't opened - no one visible. While I was sweating, in the heat - as my lunch break was ticking by.  At 11:15 or so, I left and drove across the parking lot to one of the other places that opens at 11 (all were open....) and was promptly seated and served (despite there being a party of 100...yes 100...)  I won't eat at this particular location again. Twice in a row I had to wait in 100+ degree temperature because the Manager can't seem to open his location on time."}
{"text":"Upon going to any restaurant for breakfast, lunch, or dinner, I always get the same thing no matter the place, chicken tenders.  It may be boring but it's rare for me to like any other meal at a restaurant, which is why T.G.I.Friday's surprised me beyond reason.  Their Jack Daniel's chicken is a luscious plate full with chicken, mash potatoes, broccoli and green bean medley, along with the most delicious sauce.  I shocked myself when I decided it was my new favorite meal and the only restaurant to tempt me with anything besides chicken tenders.      Probably the best part of the meal is the sauce, a special blend that I cannot even began to describe because of its rareness.  The only word that I can use to explain it is sweet, but it's more than that, the only way to know what it tastes like is to actually taste it.  It goes great with the chicken, mash potatoes, and yes, even the broccoli and green bean medley.  The chicken is cooked flawlessly, not over cooked yet not under cooked either.  It is grilled to perfection than graciously covered with the perfect complement, the sauce.  Alongside the chicken are the creamy mash potatoes, which ooze cheese over the fork with every bite with a slight bacon and onion taste to it.  Green onions are scattered over the potatoes giving the customer the option to brush them off or to eat them along with the mashed potatoes.  One of my favorite parts of the whole meal though is the broccoli and green beans covered in the Jack Daniel's sauce.  Although, it would sound like an odd combination, the mixture of veggies with the succulent sauce makes the best side for anyone.  Broccoli is one of those vegetables that if cooked too long it ends up in a mushy, tasteless mess or it could be the exact opposite, it can be hard and flavorless, but T.G.I.Friday's cooks it just right.  It's soft but has a crunch and the sauce enhances the flavor of the broccoli by giving it an extra kick.  This plate just screams yummy, which is exactly what it is.  The plate is not only scrumptious but it includes a large helping of food for only $12.79, this is cheaper than most places and for the size, you can't beat the price.  The dish has a hefty amount of the vegetables and mashed potatoes nevertheless it still includes two chicken breasts, which is more than enough for any eater.  Another great plus is the chance of taking a doggy bag home, which can provide a great lunch or midnight snack without losing flavor.  It's an exceptional left-over, something that is hard to find with food from restaurants.  Whether it's being freshly served by a waiter or being pulled out of the refrigerator, this meal won't disappoint anyone.   I have had this meal several times and every time it comes out exactly the same without any flaws.  Not only do I get this meal every time but so does my sister and brother-in-law, everyone who I have talked to who has tried it, loves it just as much as I do.  Whenever I have tried chicken meals from other places their chicken usually does not come out as tender nor does their mashed potatoes come out as cheesy.  Besides that, there is no other restaurant that offers a Jack Daniel's inspired sauce and I doubt anyone could even come close to making it.  An additional bonus is if you're not really a chicken fan they offer a similar plates which can include beef, pork, and even shrimp.  I must say the chicken is my personal favorite and one of their best sellers.   As a whole, this plate is one of the best meals I have ever had the fortune to taste.  Everything is cooked perfectly and has the taste of heaven on Earth.  It is definitely a meal that would satisfy even the hungriest of people, just remember to bring stretchy pants.  Plus, there is nothing better than a large meal that is worth more than your paying.  I would recommend it to anyone who was looking to try a different plate or place; actually I must insist that anyone who goes to T.G.I.Friday's must try the Jack Daniel's chicken."}
{"text":"TGIF Happy Valley   Not much to be happy here about.  Arrived and was greeted cordially. We were seated and opened our cutlery to find that of the four settings two had food on them and on the napkin wrappers. Not spots of food or debris but large chucks. We mentioned this to our server and she noted that some of the staff tend to be lazy; we received new cutlery which was okay.  I ordered  glass of wine, after a sip or two I noticed that their was lipstick on it, not a lot but enough to be noticeable.  This annoyed my spouse and I enough that it ruined the evening from that point forward.  I don't understand why in this day and age of high tech dish washers this still happens. Worse yet, the staff should catch this before it hits the table.  The food: actually it was good, our grand kids enjoyed their kids meal and my pasta was great. I don't know if my spouse enjoyed the meal since the mood was dead.  TGIF is a large corporation that has standards and guidelines.  They are not a mom and pop operation trying to figure this out. Why they don't have spot checks for quality control on ALL levels, dishes, cutlery, staff training, food presentation, etc. is beyond me.  Fortunately sites like Yelp are able to alert fellow clients of what to look for when they arrive.  For me I will not be patronizing TGIF much more, and I figure they won't be missing my occasional $60 meals. But I won't be missing their cutlery either."}
{"text":"After a late flight in, my wife and I wanted to get a quick bite and a drink before going home. We had 3 choices. Chili's was crowded, Applebee's was packed, so we went to Fridays that was not crowded at all. I now know why. Food took over 30 minutes, for 2 appetizers, TV's were playing the local news with no sound or CC (might as well had muted C-SPAN on), and all anyone working there wanted to do was closing clean up, even though they had 2 1/2 more hours to go till closing. Food was ok, service was sub-par. Needless to say we will not be going there again, unless there are no other options. Still would probably just go home hungry."}
{"text":"I would give no stars if I could.  Waited over 10 minutes for our drink order.  I wouldn't complain if it was busy but there were more workers than customers.  Although we did receive our food quickly, we didn't have enough silverware on our table and we had to get it from another table because our waitress didn't come back until we had our food for at least 10 minutes.  My chicken was dry and not flavorful, as was my family's.   To top it off, the tip percentage calculator on the bottom of the check starts at 18%.  I don't like those on any checks but 18% was way more than she deserved.  I don't remember it being this bad the last time I went there and we will not be going again."}
{"text":"For the life of me, I couldn't check into the location that Yelp had, so it showed this.  So lets hope it is and if not, oh well.   For years, I literally avoided TGI Friday's because i had a boring experience there.  Yeah, I said boring.  The food was barely ok and the place was just dull.  Unfortunately that location burned down to the grown (Chandler location).  When i was there I ordered the fried mac n cheese and I gotta say, i could make better mac n cheese with my eyes closed with no ingriedients.  Talk about bland.  This was the worst appetizer Ive ever had.   That was then..  So at this location, I had a total change of heart.  First off, TGI removed the nasty Mac N Cheese balls (good job!) and we ordered fried green beans.  Damn they were yummy!.   We got something else that was good.. Ohh yeah.. I remember.  I think it was shrimp or something.  I know, I don't remember.  But it was good too.  I got their ever popular Jack Daniels BBQ burger.  This is a  burger that is nationwide known from TGI and I finally had it.  guess what?  It's a burger with BBQ sauce on it. Nothing to go to the press over, but it was just good.  Drinks were good and refills were always coming.  So over all, the food was good.  Service was great.  We tend to all go out with a bunch of people, so Im always impressed when they handle a group of 8-10 people.  Nice work!"}
{"text":"I've been to this location twice in the last year and both experiences were awful.  The first time I went on a weekday in the fall of 2014 for lunch and got the french dip.  I sent the first one back because it was all gristle and could not chew it.  The second one was the same.  I left hungry and disappointed.  The second time I went was July 4, 2015. We walked in on a Saturday to meet friends - who had a coupon and chose this place. The second I walked in I was hit with the smell of raw sewage.  I suspect they had a backup recently in the kitchen or bathroom. My hamburger was mediocre and the waitress was snotty when I asked her about the smell.  I won't be going back."}
{"text":"Well the TGIF website says unlimited appetizers is ongoing however this location does not honor it ?"}
{"text":"I used to think Fridays was the bomb.  Not so much anymore.  Only thing worth a darn on the menu is the Jack Dan. stuff...which is getting real old."}
{"text":"Went there last night for late night dinner and Phillip took care of us well! Food on the same level of of others like it. Honestly the menu selection was better and we were happy with our service and meals. Pot sticker app was great, and Phillip earned extra points by offering my wife a \"water to go\" when we left and with her that's a big plus. Her exact words for that was \"that was worth an extra two bucks on the tip right there\". Compared to the restaurant we had left earlier without eating due to their service. this was night and day. Thanks to Phillip, (and you too Matt lol ;)  )  We will definitely be back again."}
{"text":"upon recieving our free entree coupon all surrounding tgif fridays restaurants closed, a nice jesture, now we cannot use the coupon terrible bussiness practice"}
{"text":"Came here for dinner after not visiting this restaurant for all most over a year and now I know why I haven't . They ran out of ribs so I order the 10oz steak and it taste burnt and it was very tough! I didn't even finish half the steak ! The happy hour specials are great but there dinner entires  are horrible ! Also the men's restroom was a mess trash over flowing with dirty paper towels and the floor was covered in urine ! Probably won't be visiting T.G.I Friday's anytime soon!"}
{"text":"This is an average restaurant. More on the low end of a TGI Fridays. If you're in a hurry to catch a flight, this probably isn't the best place for you. Its not huge and its very limited on wait staff so you do have to wait a bit sometimes. I've had the same waiter the three times I've been here and he's always very nice. The food is average. I could probably make better at home, but its decent for on the go. The one thing they will tell you is there's no substitutions. If you order a sandwich and want to sub fries for a salad you cant. You have to purchase a side salad. Ok no big deal. But when I requested the fries not be put on my plate they said they cant do that. You cant not put them on my plate?? I don't quite understand this logic of food selling. I don't want the fries, so just don't put them on my plate please. Nope, they come with the plate no matter what.   Overall this is an ok place to eat. I've definitely been to better places in airports, but Pearson airport is pretty limited so this isn't a horrible place to stop in."}
{"text":"I don't know where to begin this review because that's how bad the whole experience was.   From being greeted to waiting for my drink to being refill to rotten broccoli. When I sent back the broccoli no one said sorry. They brought a new plate that smelled like soap.   The jack Daniels chicken appetizers was burnt, my Jack Daniels flat iron was all fat and the bacon Jack Daniels burger was rare and bloody. The bacon was also under cooked.   The whole experience was terrible and now understand why TGIF is going out of business."}
{"text":"It's Fridays.  Close to school, quick service and tasty food.  Got the job done, but wouldn't go out of my way to come back."}
{"text":"If you want to go out, without really going out out (this sentence made sense in my head), then this is the place for you.  You'll always find quite a few people just hanging out in the bar area and the restaurant area is usually really busy. Drinks are decently priced and the food is well...bar food. Fried. Breaded. Greasy. You know, the usual. Definitely hit this place up if you're looking for a laid-back good time."}
{"text":"Please forgive me Yelp, for I have Chained.  It has been several months since my last descent into this red and white striped den of flair and prefabricated food.  This brazen purveyor of pseudo-good times and siren-like enticements of forbidden Jack Daniels sauce and greasy potato skins.  Again it beckoned to me at a time of weakness, sending upon me of all things...coupons.  Coupons of an almost vibrant nature.  This will not do.  I maintain that I am not a regular consumer of red meat, but a couple times a month (no, not those times) I just have a taste for a burger.  I was hungry, the coupon was there on the table with the Sunday paper, colorful and bold.  I yielded.  We went.  We threw ourselves upon the harsh and jagged rocks of corporate commercial enterprise, somehow expecting that this time, yes, certainly this time, a dry and welcoming dock of quality and wholesomeness would appear.  Alas, our hopes were dashed yet again upon the vicious and uncaring granite of the soulless entity even as my wallet was washed aside, cleaned of thirty-odd dollars.  I suppose I must come clean with the bitter and thankless details lest the Yelp deign that I am not repentant for my shameless forays into chaining:  I had the cheesy bacon cheeseburger because if you only have a big honkin' burger a couple times a month you should do it up.  I did not fully understand the menu (I'm sticking with that story) and was surprised to find that part of the cheesy monstrosity was...fried cheese.  Bacon, cheese, burger and fried cheese.  I take some small solace in the fact that I was unable to best the cheese cheesy beasty and left nearly a third on the table.  I expect that will sate the occasional cheeseburger madness for months to come.  Overall it was an average to less than average burger.  My children, for I did not spare the young, had buffalo wings which were reported to be very good, and a kids cheeseburger, which was reported to be...OK.  Nay, even not did I spare my spouse the torment of chaining, for she too was bewitched, and nearly missed being struck down by a pillar of salt.  A very small pillar.  Actually, it was just a salt shaker and it only fell in her lap but that's irrelevant.  No, for my wife, fair though she may be, and long possessing of patience, no she too was possessed by the demon burger madness and partook of the very same wicked concoction which nearly bested myself at the very same table.  And hers as well was reported to be...OK.  But it was with the youngest that thy peculiarities began, for the milk it was off.  No, not quite spoiled, just...off.  And off with it went the server, to return with nearly the same beverage and yet it was different somehow.  It was chocolate milk, pretty much.    Server, server!  Verily he did beseech unto us; \"Is there but more that I may do for you?  Thou hast but to request and it shall be done if it be within thy powers here in this realm of wall mounted chachka's!\"  Even did he say to our consternation, \"Let me know if there is anything out of the ordinary you need me to take care of.\"  Looks we did exchange, the kind and forgiving spouse and I, looks that contained so much and could be best summed up with the phrase: \"Huh?\"  So yes, chain we did."}
{"text":"The service was really ridiculous My family waited 10 min to get our drinks & appetizer order, then waited another 10 min. for drinks still waited 1/2 hr for just a small salad to come.  Total of 40 min waiting and no food, and no appetizer came  We left and canceled our order. We went to Red Robbins across the parking lot. Go there."}
{"text":"Food ok. I tried a piece of steak, which was ok and also had a grilled chicken and rice dish with steamed broccoli. I appreciated that the broccoli didn't seem smothered in butter. This place is comparable to any other TGI Fridays."}
{"text":"Fridays is Fridays.  We had to wait a bit on a Saturday night, but service was very good and fast.  I don't know what people expect of the food.  It's a chain restaurant, not gourmet.  I was just excited that my side salad wasn't all iceberg - bonus!"}
{"text":"I took my family out to eat at TGI Fridays on happy valley rd.  while my husband and I spent time looking over the menu we placed or two kids orders and shared an appetizer. The kids food arrived with the appetizer, which was fine and we asked our waitress for mustard for our sons cheeseburger, which we never received. Our other son had the kids spaghetti. When our food finally arrived my son was to the bottom of his spaghetti bowl when he noticed something was wrong. My husband and I looked to find a roach lying in the bottom of the bowl. We sent our food back to the kitchen and asked for a manager. 15 minutes later the manager arrived and said he didn't know how this could happen and offered us free dessert. We declined, since at this point we'd all lost or appetite and were concerned with the cleanliness if the kitchen. We left without eating and don't plan in returning. Poor service and roaches in my child's food were more than enough, we won't be back."}
{"text":"Having eaten at this restaurant twice this month I can say the food is absolutely delicious.  I had the Jack Daniel's Chicken both times and it contains two succulent boneless chicken breasts lathered in a flavorful Jack Daniel's marinade, with a side of the marinade for dipping, and two side dishes of your choice.  Service was great, keeping my iced tea filled consistently, and the cost for five people was totally reasonable.  Great service, affordable prices, and always delicious food, why not choose T.G.I. Friday's?  If you do, you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"The wife and I had the endless appetizer deal they have going on at TGI Friday's.  All the appetizers were good, except for one and our server made our experience really well.  Prices are what to be expected at a place like TGI Friday's so that was nice.  Overall, it's a nice place to eat at if you're shopping at Norterra."}
{"text":"Friday's used to be soooo good years ago. Their service has always been excellent but their food has gone down so much over the years. We ordered their potsticker appetizer. It was doughy. Costco sells better tasting. My husband ordered the buffalo chicken sandwich and he commented you can easily tell it was frozen beforehand and it would have been better taste and money-wise to go to Wendy's and ordered a better tasting sandwich. I ordered the Cajun Shrimp & Chicken Pasta. When I read alfredo sauce, I'm thinking creamy. It was the complete opposite. It was covered in grease and there maybe was a teaspoon of melted cheese on top. There was a thick layer of butter on the bottom.  Don't go here if you want good food. Go elsewhere. We wish we would have gone to Logan's or Red Robin or anywhere else but here and spend money on food that was good."}
{"text":"TGIF. I now know what it stands for - That Grimy Icky Feeling.  Everything was dirty and sticky. The seat, the table, the menu and the salt & pepper shakers were sticky and stained. The burgers were ok, but you can get the same burger at Carl's Jr.  Definitely won't be doing this place again."}
{"text":"I am a regular here. Everytime I have been here the service has been wonderful. All of the employees are friendly. Chris and Jerrod are hard workers. The 2 for $20 deal is awesome. Become a rewards member to earn free dinners!! Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Their Jack Daniels sauce is my favorite. Love getting their mashed potatoes. Some of the best grilled chicken, ribs, and steak you can get out. I love Fridays. Especially their drinks too. Very reasonably priced. Have a new 2 for 20 menu."}
{"text":"When I die I want to be buried in a coffin made of Jack Daniels chicken strips.  That way I know I'll be in heaven even if Peter denies me at the gates . . . Woah, I just out-smarted God!  I swear, you can put Jack Daniels glaze on a petrified rat turd and even Top Chef snob Tom Colicchio would eat it.  It's that good.  If you're ever torn between this Friday's and the Desert Ridge TGIF, stick with this one.  The Desert Ridge TGIF frequently has shite service and inconsistent quality control in the kitchen.  Happy Valley TGIF, on the other hand, is consistently pretty good.  TGIFJD 4 life, foo.  And the afterlife too!"}
{"text":"When I die I want to be buried in a coffin made of Jack Daniels chicken strips.  That way I know I'll be in heaven even if Peter cock-blocks me . . . Wait, I just out-smarted God!  I swear, you can put Jack Daniels glaze on a petrified rat turd and even Top Chef snob Tom Colicchio would eat it.  It's that good.  Unfortunately everything else isn't. The service--at this location--flat out sucks half the time. And the consistency of this kitchen staff sucks about 35% of the time.  If you can, try the Happy Valley TGIF instead.  My only other minor gripe is that all the newer Friday's (such as this one) just don't seem to have the same charm as the older Fridays.  But I'm willing to let all that 2-star worthy crap slide for some more 5-star worthy Jack Daniels chicken and burgers.  TGIFJD 4 life, foo.   And the afterlife too!"}
{"text":"Small and cramped, but prices aren't too bad for airport fare. Grab an open seat at the bar, find a place to stow your luggage, and the bartenders will take excellent care of you."}
{"text":"This restaurant really should not exist. The waiter has made a ton of mistakes and the food takes forever to come out."}
{"text":"It was a beautiful day out and we wanted to have a couple of drinks and lunch on a place that had a patio. When we walked into the restaurant there were two girls standing behind the server station. We asked to sit on the patio. The hostess told me that they didn't have any servers on the patio. So I said, does that mean we can't sit outside? to which she replied- You might want to ask the bartender if he wants to help you, but other than that, I don't know what to tell you.  First off, the place was practically empty. The only reason we came here (I've sworn off this location for lousy service) was because the wait at the Red Robin next door was 20 minutes. Yes, I know that should have been a red flag. Why is this place empty and the place next door has a 20 minute wait. Now I know. They have 2 employees standing there doing nothing and WE have to ask the bartender to help us?   Needless to say we left and went next door to Red Robin and waited. I will never be back to Fridays. No wonder they are closing all their locations."}
{"text":"Awful service.  The waiter had the personality of a dead moth.  I think he said 4 words to us the whole time we were there.  He actually brought us the wrong appetizer because I couldn't hear what he said and after asking him to repeat himself again, I finally just said, \"Ummm, ok sure\" and then he brought the wrong thing.  Never seen so much white trash at Desert Ridge.  Tab was cheap though.  $20 for two appetizers and 2 alcoholic drinks.  Next time I think I'll just pay the extra money and go to Rock Bottom or Yardhouse."}
{"text":"When your options are limited, as they are in the US section of Terminal 3, TGI Friday's is a like an oasis in the middle of the desert.  There are not a lot of eating options near the \"A\" gates and since my first flight got can celled and my second was delayed, I had time to kill. Plus I was hungry and this was about my only option.  The server was very nice, although a little chatty.  I'm not looking to be anybody's best friend, I just want my meal.  She sold me on the large margarita which was weak (and at $14.99, more expensive than my food!).   My bacon cheeseburger (with American-style bacon, even though I was totally still in Canada..what a ripoff!) was over-cooked but still pretty tasty.  Fries were good.  All in all, it wasn't awful."}
{"text":"Mm. TGIF.  You're hit or miss, especially this location. My family and I only ever come here when we're dead tired from work and nobody wants to cook dinner.  The last time I was here was pretty darn lack luster and the waiter pretty much ignored us the entire time we were eating, only stopping to ask if everything was okay. He went about doing whatever he was doing. Walking back and forth in an almost empty restaurant. Getting ready to close up 2 hours early maybe?  You know what would have made it really awesome? If I had my glass of water refilled. The food is average, and salty. My parents kept complaining about how salty everything was, and our cups were still... Not refilled.   That's my only gripe about this place, when it's 10 p.m and not busy, my whole family feels ignored, and they've pretty much decided to avoid coming here for awhile. Sorry TGIF. Maybe next time?"}
{"text":"Disappointed.  Normally things here are ok - nothing fantastic.  Yesterday, I ordered carryout Chipotle Yucatan salad for lunch.  The menu said the salad included cilantro and avocado.  The salad was pretty small compared to what I have gotten in the restaurant in the past.  I got exactly 3 TINY chunks of avocado and ZERO cilantro.  For $10, I expected a bigger salad and it should have plenty of ingredients.  In addition, it was a hot MESS.  Looked like it was originally put into the 'dine in restaurant' bowl and someone realized it was carryout and then just scraped it into the styrofoam box."}
{"text":"Solid."}
{"text":"Horrible, horrible, horrible.  Do not go here.  The service was bad and the food was worse.  I know it is to be expected that chain food is not going to blow my mind, but I truly am not a picky eater.  I love chain food but this place is awful.  I doubt I will ever go back to a TGI Fridays at any location.  We got the 2 for $10 deal.  The appetizers were large, but nothing special, clearly just frozen and thrown in a deep fryer. I ordered some sort of pasta Alfredo with chicken.  It was one of the smallest portions I've ever gotten in a  restaurant.  The pasta was so overcooked it was mushy.  The Alfredo was caked onto the bottom of the plate, to the point were most of it would not come off.  The chicken was so overcooked I could barely cut into it. Not the mention the place is constantly crawling with college kids, making ti so loud you can barely have a conversation.  Save yourself the time and money and avoid this place."}
{"text":"Kids eat free Mon & Tuesday with adult entree.  Stopped in today for a very late lunch at about 3:15pm.  It wasn't busy at all and the service was great.  Thanks Jim!  I had the lobster mac & cheese and it was REALLY good.  Rich, but really good."}
{"text":"This friday's has been recently remodelled, so it's nice and clean and new-looking even though it's been around for awhile.  The remodelling job itself SCREAMS trying to hard, but that's probably friday's corporate's fault.  They will serve you your pecan crusted sicilian teriyaki quesadillas with green bean fries and cheesecake in a reasonable amount of time, and without any of the way, way, way over the top smarm that you might expect from a friday's waitstaff.  And you don't have to drive all the way up to North Prospect.  Three stars is probably the maximum I am able to give to any friday's, anywhere, just out of principle, so this awarding of three stars should really say to you \"best possible friday's.\""}
