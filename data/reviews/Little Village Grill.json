{"text":"Delicious food that is prepared quickly. We were visiting Charlotte from the DC area and needed something fast before heading to the airport to catch our flight. Right after we ordered I filled up my cup with some freshly brewed ice tea (sweet and unsweet) and by the time I walked outside to claim a table the food was ready. Fortunately they don't have that Gold Peak ( aka gold piss) crap that a lot of restaurants have in Maryland. I love brewed tea.... So we ate outside at one of the tables. There are only about 3-4 tables out front so most people just grab their food and go. Overall, a great place for gyros that is affordable and ready in a snap. I suspect other items on the menu are also tasty but I can only comment on what I ate and it was delicious!"}
{"text":"soooooo good!! Had their lamb and beef gyro and fries. Everything was delicious! even the sweet tea is awesome."}
{"text":"Yum, yum, yum. Yum! Ordered delivery from here and was stunned by the triple threat of a nice delivery guy, lightning prompt service, and oh-my-gosh delicious food. I got a standard gyro plus fries, and I couldn't believe how amazing the fries were. I'm picky on fries, and these were honestly some of the best I've ever had--extra special considering they were delivery, which most fries don't hold up to! Price was very fair as well. A win."}
{"text":"I love this place.. Go early or late! It's busy at lunch time."}
{"text":"I cannot believe it has taken so long to write a review for this wonderful little place. This was the first place we ordered from when we were unloading the moving truck. This place looks tiny, but you can smell the food from down the block. I'm glad it's small because the savings are passed along. First, I couldn't believe the prices. Second, I would have and have paid more for food that fresh and so good. The gyros taste better than anywhere else I've had them. Even their chicken gyro, which I must admit I was skeptical of chicken, is delicious. I've had just about everything. I love their club sandwich and fries, no, I'm addicted to them. I swear I've gained 10lbs moving to Charlotte because their food is fresh, the staff are happy and so nice and this place really is a gem. They even have a vegan Greek dressing that was not only great (I am dubious of vegan), but it also creamy! My picky kids love it too. The staff is so funny my boy is \"pink lemonade\" to them and they start the orders. OH, THE BALAVA! I didn't even know baklava was supposed to crunch because everyone I've had is soggy. I love baklava, now I know what it is supposed to taste like and I'm completely spoiled.  THIS PLACE IS FANTASTIC!"}
{"text":"Great service, delicious food, super inexpensive. I was visiting my friend and we were downtown, looking for some place cheap and thought the prices on Yelp had to be wrong but they are correct. Tiny little place and it was just what we needed."}
{"text":"Fantastic gyros...and cheap!! Great place, small little hole in the wall. You can tell by the long lines that form around lunch and dinner time."}
{"text":"We have only had the gyro's here but they are so good they get a good review just for that.  Definitely the best in Charlotte.  They put fries in the gyro which I was skeptical of the first time but I'm a believer now.  It's a small place with only a few tables and you are pretty much limited to street parking.  But if you go in the evening when everyone has left the uptown area after work, it's usually pretty easy to park and sit.

We give it 4.5 Little Village's out of 5."}
{"text":"Really good food. Lamb gyro had great flavor (especially with a little extra tzatziki). They put a couple fries in it - for me those sort of got lost in all the wonderful flavor of the gyro. Fries had great texture and nice and hot. Greek salad was good as well. There was a line but as others have said, they do a good job keeping it moving."}
{"text":"Good, consistent food!  Fries are great - best around!  Great Gyros, Cheese Burgers, and Cheese Steaks -- everything I've order so far has surpassed my expectations!"}
{"text":"Great lunch place near JWU. Best Greek gyro in CLT. Potato salad is awesome. Prepare to wait a few in a line out the door (it's super small) during lunch hours. Also there's a Starbucks one block away, so you can grab a coffee on the way back to work."}
{"text":"I don't get all the great reviews here. I live in one of the condo buildings next to Little Villiage Grill and have eaten there several times over the last few years when I needed something quick. After tonight's visit I'll never eat there again. I had the lamb gyro and could only eat a few bites. The taziki  sauce tasted rancid and completely overpowered every other flavor. In the past I've had their burgers, subs, and fries. There's no doubt that the burger patties and fries are frozen food service items. Very disappointing. I get that people like this place because its cheap, but the quality isn't much above fast food, if at all. Greek dives are a dime a dozen, and nearly every one I've been to does a better job than this place. I don't mean to sound so negative, but I can't spend money there anymore."}
{"text":"Omg. Best gyro I've ever had-and for $5!?!?!? Ordered, paid and received my food in under 2 minutes."}
{"text":"The food is fast and hot! Made fresh and to order. Yes, it's a small little restaurant but the Greek food is is so good. I like to order and then sit outside and watch the world go by. It's an easy walk from center city, just west on Trade St."}
{"text":"\"Lil Vill\" is what is college students call this place. It's is the #1 Jwu food stop. With everything from burgers to pitas and salads it is the best greek fast food I've ever tasted. Can't wait for them to branch out more into to other states !"}
{"text":"Food was GREAT.  I had the Cheeseburger Pita and it was just what I was craving.  The pita break was great and the side of pasta salad was light and tasty.  It is SUPER inexpensive too.  I will definitely be back here!"}
{"text":"This place is the best spot in the area for lunch.  No one comes close in terms of price and quality.  I've pretty much tried everything on their menu and I can't complain about anything I've eaten.  They're fast , friendly and take pride in their food."}
{"text":"I can eat here everyday. It's definitely feasible. The people are awesome. The food is delish. The service is quick. Never had any issues ordering from here."}
{"text":"Little Village Grill is on the Trade St side of the Gateway Village parking garage. It's a small place with limited seating at a few outdoor tables. The interior is always immaculate, and the staff is always friendly when not too busy or alternatively efficient during the rush. 

While they have good burgers here, I really like the Greek items the best. The gyros are very good, as are the Greek salads. The cheeseburger pitas are another favorite of mine, and they're as good here as they are at that other place that's famous for putting burgers on a pita.

The prices are also very good, maybe only slightly higher than most fast-food places while offering much better quality. I also like that the owners are the primary cooks here. I like supporting local businesses anyway, but especially ones where the owner is working for a living. That kind of hands-on involvement tends to assure that quality and service are maintained at a higher level than most."}
{"text":"i love this place i go there all the time i am a student a johnson and wales right across the street and it is everyones favorite place to eat after class. there french fries are amazing much like everything else on there menu."}
{"text":"Great place. Gyros are fantastic, as are the fries, and Greek salad. I eat here at least once a week.

Friendly and very fast service."}
{"text":"Whenever, I am in the mood for a beef and lamb gyro the Little Village Grill is where I go. They definitely provide good portions of meat. What's up with throwing in a couple of fries in the gyro. Something different and not common. No doubt about it. They got good fries. Crispy on the outside. Usually order a side of fries with the gyro. 

Going to have to try the lamb burger. Saw one of the photos posted by Nikki. Once in a while I gotta change the routine and try something different.

Always, get the meal to go and there will be a line during lunch hours. Now, I call and place an order then go pick up.

This is my go to place for gyros if you in the area."}
{"text":"Hands down best gyro uptown. I pick up at least once a week. I'm Greek and I approve this tiny hole in the wall."}
{"text":"OMG....talk about a taste of HEAVEN!
I la la la love this PLACE!
The Chicken GYRO is the absolute best!
the food is always fresh and always tasty.
I also enjoy the staff. Always friendly and always speedy!
sometimes they even sell chocolate bars...lol..
I believe its for the youth..but anyway this place is very cool, its located on West trade and has a great vibe! Its small but very cutesy and you can tell its full of love!
try it out if you like Greek food or if you never had Greek food!
I'm sure you will enjoy.
make sure you get that Gyro loaded with everything to truly enjoy it!"}
{"text":"This place is great! Best food in the gateway village area in my opinion. Pitas are always great, and the fries are awesome too. Definitely try it out, I promise you will be back!"}
{"text":"These guys serve best sandwich and pita breads .. I would prefer them than subway . I love the fries they serve , there is always a  big queue .. If you work in uptown Charlotte .. Don't miss trying in little village grill ."}
{"text":"Awesome gyros! A small place with a few tables. The gyro lamb/beef meat  is stuffed with fries in it...strange I never had fries in my gyros. Nevertheless gyros had great seasoning and it was delicious. Next time I will have it minus the fries stuffed in it! Parking will be a issue here on weekdays since its Uptown and there's construction going on in the area opposite. The offstreet paid parking ahead was closed and with tow signs everywhere. We came on a Saturday and empty car parked lot just before the restaurant where the employees parked."}
{"text":"No frills, no idle chit chat with the staff, standing room only! Just place your order and go. This is a little hole-in-the wall off of Trade street with no indoor seating. There are a few umbrella'd seats outside, but you are subject to the weather (obviously). Stood in line, maybe 6 people ahead of me, but it only took a few moments to get to counter and get my food.
I had a great gyro and it had french fries in it! Overall, the food tasted great, not too heavy (i.e. greasy) and not too messy (no shirt stains). I may want to go light on the onions next time but will definitely eat there again. 
Can't locate a website or menu. But it does have the \"no coke, pepsi\" feel for options...without the frustration."}
{"text":"I just moved to the apartment complex nearby and am so happy to have this great little spot to grab dinner. The food is made-to-order, fresh and inexpensive. I love the lamb gyro with a few fries on it, delicious!"}
{"text":"One of the best places in the area..great quality food and excellent service. Amazing pitas and salads..great baklava as well"}
{"text":"Little Village Grill is by far one of my favorite places in Charlotte. The best gyro, the best sub, the best fries, possibly the best food in the area (especially if you're broke). I use to get the Little Village Sub with steak, provolone, grilled onions, lettuce, tomato, mayo, oil and vinegar but lately I've been hooked on the Pork Gyro with a side of fries drowning in greek dressing :)

Ella bounces between the Grilled Chicken Gyro and a side of fries or the Greek Salad with Grilled Chicken. We've never had a bad experience at Little Village Grill and judging from the constant line out the front door I thinks its safe to say its a local favorite.

Check them out today and let us know what you think."}
{"text":"Good lamb gyros - and they put french fries on top of it. Not sure how authentic it is, but it's great so I don't really care! The french fries are really good to - very crispy - maybe my favorite in the city. I will be returning again."}
{"text":"The best fries-- so good! I like the cheesesteak, the cheeseburger pita, and the regular burgers.I haven't ever had a bad experience here-- great staff, always super quick, cheap (for large quantity!!) and my only complaint is that they aren't open on Sunday."}
{"text":"Little Village Grill is located in Gateway Village and is convenient to a few of the offices located in the complex.  Thus, it's a great option for lunch... that is, if you want a delicious, satisfying lunch that may or may not cause a food coma in the afternoon.  Ya might want to pick up one of those 2:30pm coffees.

This little place makes delicious lamb gyros and Greek salads at a reasonable price.  The gyro is fresh and juicy and comes with fries in it, which make it all the more delicious!  The side salad is also a good portion and is reasonably priced.  The salad dressing is great as well.

Very little options around Gateway, but this is probably my favorite place out of all of them."}
{"text":"If you are in the Gateway area, and even Uptown.  This is well worth calling in an order or standing in line.  The food is cooked while you wait and your wait time is not long at all.  I have had from the burgers to the club sandwiches to Gyros and everything is always amazing."}
{"text":"Honestly, one of my favorite hole in the wall restaurants that I've discovered and I'm constantly craving for it! 

My favorite is definitely the Grilled Chicken Gyro with French fries & DO NOT FORGET THE BALAVA!!! It's so good, I haven't branched out to anything else on the menu because it's just THAT good. My boyfriend's favorite is the Lamb&Beef Gyro and it's pretty solid. To me it's all about that taziki sauce, and they make it just just right! 

Another plus, basically everything on their menu is a little under $5!!! And service is nice and quick.

The only con but would not stop me from coming back is this restaurant is LITERALLY a hole in the wall, it's tiny. Don't expect to come in a group to dine in and be accommodated because they have a few tiny tables inside and 2 tables outside."}
{"text":"This place is a fantastic lunch spot. I've been going here for a couple of years and haven't ventured beyond the Lamb Gyro or Chicken Gyro. The lamb tends be greasy so I try avoid it but in no way is that a complaint, just personal preference. The spices are great and they even add a \"few fries\" to the gyro for what we'll call differentiation. None-the-less, a nice surprise.

The Chicken Gyro with a Greek Side Salad is my classic go-to. Preparation and flavor is always consistent so I always know what I'm going to get. If you are looking for great food with a nice outdoor spot to eat lunch then this place will certainly fit the bill."}
{"text":"I simply love Little Village Grill. What makes it awesome is the consistency. I can order anything...multiple times...and guaranteed to be very fresh, and tasty.  I have tried so many things on the menu.  My favorite is Greek salad, with grilled chicken.  the grilled chicken gyro is also amazing!  such a filling sandwich.  And the fries.  so darn good that you eat the first one...and the last one...and they stay crisp and tasty throughout.  I went to Little Village today....and before the cashier could even complete the transaction....my order was ready.  Incredible Service!! Amazing Service!!!  I try to go there at least 3 times a week!!!  Love it!!!  One of these days I can imagine LVG expanding to have greater seating inside and out.  there are only 3-4 small tables inside.  But for what they offer...great food and service...in a small location...it is simply awesome!!!"}
{"text":"This place has great food and very reasonable prices.  The service is very friendly and quick.  The location is \"cozy\" but adequate.  I have been eating here frequently for over a year and have never had any complaints."}
{"text":"As noted in other reviews, this is a quintessential hole in the wall but the food is fantastic. I had the beef and lamb Gyro and my wife had the grilled chicken Gyro and both were outstanding. The fries were also great. I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"The food here is good value and fast. Pretty good cheap fast gyros and decent burgers and fries make it a good place to visit."}
{"text":"This place is soooooo good!  It's a really small location so limited seating.  My husband and I usually take it to go and sit at the park.  We usually order the gyro and chicken pita, very very delicious!  Parking is tough due to construction and limited street parking,  line sometimes long but their service is pretty quickly.  It is sooo worth the wait!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place!! I live around the corner and so happy that this is my local spot. Best Greek food in town! Their burgers are awesome,  gyros are the best (I love the lamb), and since I have gone vegetarian the black bean burger is my top choice, but don't knock the salads as they rock too. Their fries are awesome as well, and way super addictive with the seasoning. The staff is great, I think some are students but they are so nice, and remember faces. The delivery guy is a great guy too so make sure to tip him bc that's only fair!  Keep up the great work guys! See you Monday :)"}
{"text":"Me and my friends go there a lot after class. It's cheap, quick and delicious. No reason not to try."}
{"text":"What a great find...and a steal!  Huge, delicious sandwiches run only about $4.  Sides are about $2.  Most of the menu items are Greek-based, and Little Village Grill does Greek very well.  We tried their tasty, fresh lamb and beef gyros, full of meat, tomatoes, onions, and tzatziki sauce.  I even spotted the meat spit behind the cash register where they slice off pieces as needed, so you know it's fresh!  

For sides, we tried the Greek potato salad (made with Greek oregano) and the new garbanzo bean salad with feta cheese.  The potato salad was good, but the garbanzo bean salad was definitely the winner of the two.  It had a lot of flavor (I think it's the cheese!) and chock full of bean protein.  

We were too full to eat dessert there, too, but we did bring home some yummy, sweet, gooey baklava for later.  

Little Village Grill is designed mostly for take-out orders, but they do have some limited seating indoors and out.   Everyone there is SO friendly.  It's fresh Greek fast food at its best!"}
{"text":"I dream about the food at this place! I get the Greek chicken pita and add feta (for only 45 cents extra its a ton of feta and makes it perfect) and fries. The tzatiki sauce is spot on perfect and the chicken I perfectly marinated. My husband likes the lamb gyro and finds in perfect as well. We have tried both the potato salad and the garbanzo beans - both are very tasty but it certainly that chicken pita that brings me 20 minutes to eat at this place! Definitely worth the stop! Be aware there is limited seating but that would never, ever stop me from visiting!"}
{"text":"Affordable and amazing! Really enjoyed their gyro and pasta salad. Great place to check out for lunch!"}
{"text":"I love little village. One of my favorite places to go to after class for quick and friendly service. It's tiny; however, I enjoy eating outside on a nice day to people watch. In addition, the prices are really cheap. A bang for your buck. I recommend the single, french fries and the lamb gyro."}
{"text":"Small place in uptown. Perfect for lunch! The best gyros I've ever tried! Granted, I'm not a gyro expert, but Man! They were good :)"}
{"text":"I loved this place. easily the best gyro I've had in America."}
{"text":"I'm in love...with a cheesesteak! And some garbanzo bean salad. Wow, the cheesesteak is perfect. On an awesome roll (a bit crispy on the outside, soft on the inside), beef, cheese, onion and a bit of mayo. (No green peppers to ruin it!) Absolutley delicious!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing- small hole in the wall place but best gyros I have ever had.  Will be coming back next time I am in town for sure."}
{"text":"Love it. I drove past it a thousand times before I realized it was there - it's TINY! Clearly, being uptown, there's nowhere to park. If you're lucky enough to grab a parallel spot then YAY. If not, you gotta get dodgy. But it's so worth it. Authentic, delicious greek food. I've been eating gyros since I was 5 and my dad tricked me into eating one - saying it was \"juicy meat\" not lamb. I pride myself on knowing a good juicy meat gyro and ooh buddy, THIS is a good gyro. Besides the gyro, the rest of the menu is phenomenal. Heavenly Baklava, delicious sandwiches and oh, did I mention the best Gyro in Charlotte? The staff is always cute and friendly, and the little outdoor tables are perfect for grabbing a quick lunch and being on your way."}
{"text":"I can't believe I've lived in the Queen City for over 3 years and have yet to review this hidden gem.  As you can tell from the many many 5 star reviews, there really is no need to ponder any further ... get yo @$$ to Little Village and order yoself some noms. 

I've been here probably 10 times, and I've only had the same thing. The traditional beef & lamb gyro combo with fries. 10/10 would recommend. They have those delicious breaded style french fries that just hit the spot. AND, the order of fries is huge, easily enough to split between two people. It's somewhere around $7.50 for the combo, which is cheap in my book. 

The gyro/greek salad is a fan favorite for my wife, if you're into that sort of healthy thing."}
{"text":"OK.. Gyro's are one of my favorite foods EVER. These Gyros were super weird. My coworker and I were both disappointed. The meat was a lamb/beef mix that tasted like cumin. It was a very weird seasoning choice and nothing a Gyro should ever contain. The fries were amazing though. Not worth the $9 quite honestly. I won't go back and I am suprised by the raving reviews. I will go to Greek Isles next time.. that place is the BOMB!"}
{"text":"Amazing gyro and fries! We got LVG for dinner one evening to go, and they were very quick with our order. They were busy with to-go orders so I assumed the quality would be lacking, but let me tell you, everything was on par. I would recommend getting food here to-go, as there is little seating, and what little seating there is, has people waiting for to-go orders sitting. 

You MUST try this place especially if you live with in walking distance!!"}
{"text":"After a campus tour we were informed this restaurant is the place to go. After a short walk, we easily found this quaint, amazing place. As we entered and made our way to the counter to order, we were greeted by a beautiful young woman with an amazing smile. 

We ordered the cheesesteak, grilled chicken sandwich, beef & lamb gyro, and hotdog. We also ordered fries as it was also suggested.

After a relatively short wait, we received what can only be described as a near perfect lunch for such a great day. Everything was absolutely delicious and was enhanced by the great customer service.

Next time we're in town this is definitely on our list for a great casual lunch. I highly recommend this great place to enjoy your afternoon with great food."}
{"text":"Little Village is truly a gem in uptown. It doesn't look like much from the outside, but don't let that fool you. The food is consistently so good every time and not to mention it's extremely quick and budget friendly. I recommend this place to everyone I can."}
{"text":"I'm in Charlotte visiting a friend and this was the first place I tried. So CHEAP and so GOOD! I had the beef and lamb gyro and I can't wait to go one more time before I leave."}
{"text":"In Charlotte for business, have walked by this joint a few times in the last couple of days.... Had I only known what I was missing?!?!

This. Place. Is. Amazing! 

Tonight's fare: lamb & beef gyro (+lettuce), house salad (tzatsiki for dressing), Greek potato salad, and baklava. 

The tzastiki sauce .... If I could make a meal out of it, I would!!! 

Go!! No regrets!!"}
{"text":"Great place friendly staff, fast service, affordable, old school Greek diner. What more can you ask for. Great for breakfast and lunch. Not open for dinner which is ashame."}
{"text":"The best hidden spot in uptown Charlotte.  It is a little down Trade St. but its worth the walk (and the Gateway area is not terrible).  The food is GREAT and the prices are AMAZING.  Awesome greek food, as well as burgers/ fries.  If you live in Gateway, you should eat here like 4 times a week- its reallllly good."}
{"text":"Little village grill is a hole in the wall. It's cheap and it is tasty. For a quick gyro or burger, it's the perfect stop. Absolutely nothing beats their fries dipped in tatziki. I also love their chicken pita. They are super fast. There's not much seating inside but that's ok because if you sit in there, you're bound to smell like grease. Don't expect anything fancy but you'll definitely be satisfied."}
{"text":"The village is probably the most consistent spot in the gateway area.  They have sandwiches, burgers, salads, pitas, and gyros.  They get really busy during peak lunch times and the lines are very long but move pretty steady.  I've tried the burger, fries, pita, and subs.  The burger and fries are probably my favorite because they have grilled onions as an option.  The steak pita is good but they use the thin steak um's.  To avoid the crowd order as soon as they open or you'll have to wait out the noon crowd."}
{"text":"In town for the solar eclipse and decided to try this place. Hands down one of the best Greek places I've eaten at. Had the lamb and beef gyro."}
{"text":"One of the best cheapest lunches in downtown Charlotte.  I have ate here a few times and each time it's perfect.  The fries are great and I have had both the Falafel and the chicken gyro.  They are both great and it's a must go to place in downtown especially for lunch.  Everything taste fresh and has a lot of flavor."}
{"text":"No competition.. Hands down the best Gyro in Charlotte! Authentic Greek owned and excellently managed. Everything I've ever ordered (been coming here consistently for 4 years) has been accurate and perfectly delicious. If I ever moved away I would consider visiting Charlotte just for this place. 

Only (minor) downside is that the place is small. Limited tables and seating. Functions mostly as a take out joint. If they ever expanded and added a dinner menu ( say Spanakopita and Pastichio I would live at this restaurant!) They create quality sandwiches, gyros, and salads. Recommendation: try it out, affordable prices, real quality ingredients, made to order, worth it :-)"}
{"text":"never can go wrong with LVG! Its worth the long lunch lines! My favorite is the falafel pita! Everybody loves the fries! I also enjoy their greek salad and pretty much anything gyro!"}
{"text":"We had gyros, french fries, Greek salad, and baklava to go.  All were great.  The pita was soft and chewy, the meat was tender, the tzatziki sauce was great, the fries were crispy (loved them!), the salad was fresh, and the baklava was delicious!  They had everything ready when we got there!"}
{"text":"The food is possible the best Greek food I've ever eaten. It's affordable, fresh, and amazing!! The only thing I wish was different was the environment, but that's okay because it is the city. But man, If you get the chance, give this place a try because it's awesome."}
{"text":"This is a take out joint for sure, unless you want to sit on their cute bistro sets outside. This is one of my favorite quick bite places not many people know about. It is not only delicious, it is one of the most affordable places I have been to in uptown! The wait is usually 5-10 minutes at the longest. I strongly encourage you get one of their gyros and fries, or salads, but who am I kidding, everything is great!"}
{"text":"Great food for a cheap price, strongly recommend the grilled chicken sandwich but it can get backed up bad around lunch time so try and get there a little earlier"}
{"text":"little village is perfect for gyros! they are really, really yummy :) the inside is very small and has limited seating, but we sat on the patio outside. some water from one of the apartment balconies above dripped down on us but that's about the worst of it. 

prices are very reasonable and the gyros are large enough for 2 people to split. 

the gyro was VERY flavorful, the tzatziki had cucumber chunks (which isn't my preference) but they were not overpowering and it was good. the onions were very potent and flavorful (we were breathing fire into the next day despite having multiple altoids and teeth brushings). 

boyfriend would give it a 5 star rating."}
{"text":"Hidden gem for uptown Charlotte.  Great quick & cheap place to grab subs, pitas & salads.  Fries are A++++.  One of your best options for bang for buck when eating in the city."}
{"text":"Being new to the gyro, I've only had it at 4 different places.  This is the only one I've had twice.  SO GOOD.  They put a few french fries on it, which I think is delicious.  The sauce is super flavorful, and their onions will knock you down with the flavor.  So much food, and the price is very reasonable.  Other Yelpers make me want to try the rest of their menu, and I probably will, eventually.  The only downside is that the place is tiny.  Literally 3 2-tops inside, and 2 umbrella-shaded 2-tops outside.   I'll keep trying new gyro places, but every 2nd or 3rd time I have a craving, Little Village will satisfy it for me."}
{"text":"I haven't had a good gyro in a several years.  This place is quite good!  The smell alone should sell you.  Almost everything was under $5, too!  The price and the food makes this one of my favorites.  In fact, this is my first Yelp post as this place was good enough to make me want to share it!"}
{"text":"Super great place to get lunch or dinner if you're in the third ward. The prices are super low and the food is great quality. It isn't so great for eating in, but perfect for ordering carry out. They have a few tables inside, but it is a pretty tight space. They do have some seating out front which would be great for when the weather is nice. I love the turkey sub."}
{"text":"Little village grill is a little hidden gem in Charlotte. Located in the gateway area, this restaurant is only open from lunch time to 8 and closed on Sundays. They don't have any seating area(maybe 4 high tops inside), but they do have some outdoor seating area when the weather is nice. 

Now let's talk about the food! 

Their fries are hands down amazing! I think they batter them before deep frying them making them crispy, but soft when you bite into them. You must try them! Their salads are also great. My favorite is the gyro salad and they do not skimp on the meat. Their regular gyros (pronounced euro) are huge and everything is made to order. 

LVG is also super cheap ($5-$7 on average for a meal) and they give you large portions so you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Quick service and fresh food! Was looking for something healthy and fast in the area and this place seemed to be the only decent one around. Ordered a large Mediterranean salad for about $7 and I was fully satisfied. My friend ordered the same, but with chicken and I don't think she was able to finish hers. If I were more hungry, I would have definitely wanted to try their gyros!"}
{"text":"This place is great to eat.  I work uptown.  It has a wide vairety of food at competitive prices.  They are fast food, but you wouldn't know it.  Always very friendly and clean.  I eat here about 3-4 time a month."}
{"text":"I go to LVG about once every year. That's down from the once a week my wife and I went there when we lived in 3rd Ward. We now live in Washington, DC and stop by LVG every time we are in town and it's open (or should I say O-pah-en!)

LVG deserves SIX STARS because they always go one-better on the food, the fries and, oh yes, the rating.

Tzatziki: 102, Gyro: 102, Fries: 99, Personality: 105!

Best Greek meal you will get in uptown. Hope to see you soon as it's been way too long. Opah!"}
{"text":"Best. Falafel. Ever. This is hands down the best falafel pita I have ever had. Service was quick and friendly and for under $5 this can't be beat. I live within walking distance so parking wasn't an issue as some reviews has stated. This place is hands down one of the best in Charlotte."}
{"text":"The best place for lunch around gateway hands down!  The staff is super friendly, service is quick, prices are great and the food is outstanding.  Best chicken gyro and fries!"}
{"text":"Great place, great food, and cheap  literally bought a lamb and beef gyro, ate outside and went back in and purchased another to eat later. That good."}
{"text":"Hidden gyro restaurant that's basically like one step up from a NYC street cart. Food menu is short and to the point. They get you your food quickly and it is very flavorful. It's out of the way from uptown so I'm guessing most of their business is from the college or apts/condos above it. Not even sure if they have parking because we live close enough to walk. There are street spots out front, but this is basically uptown. Overall, prices and taste are spot on for gyros, so if you're in the mood for something quick and cheap, and aren't trying to experience the full service restaurant experience, this is your place! Thanks guys, see ya next time!"}
{"text":"I'd eat here every day if I could. LVG is the spot to go to if you work or are around the Third Ward area of Charlotte. Tucked under Gateway Village apartments/condos, this place serves amazing gyros and fries + some other amazing Greek food. You will not be disappointed. Please open a second location (or more!) around Charlotte!"}
{"text":"Great for to-go food - burgers, falafel, Greek salad - all very good! Don't be afraid of the line at lunchtime it moves quickly!"}
{"text":"I thought the staff was very friendly and nice but the food however did not exactly taste authentic. I picked this place based on previous reviews claiming that this is the most authentic Greek food place in Charlotte but I can assure you as someone who was born and raised in Greece that the gyros weren't really authentic, on a spit kinda thing. Also the tzatziki sauce tasted run down watery. So overall it was okay for me.

Also I liked that they tried to bring a European kinda feel to this place by putting seating outside but the sidewalk is too small for that and there's people walking by you watching you eat, it seems kind of awkward at first."}
{"text":"Awesome lamb & beef gyro! If you like fries....they have perfect fries. 
On the favorites list."}
{"text":"Very small place. But WOW the food is packed with plenty of flavor for very cheap prices! I tried this place for the first time yesterday and had the grilled chicken gyro and fries. It was AWESOME and some of the best tazik sauce Ive ever had! The food was so good that I went and had the same meal today for lunch! I'm excited to try more things on the menu!"}
{"text":"Cheap, tasty, and cosy place. This very small corner-like restaurant makes one of the best burgers and subs in Uptown Charlotte. It's very unexpensive and service is fast. I eat there almost weekly. Highly recommended"}
{"text":"Went to the Little Village Grill before heading to the Spectrum Friday night. My experience was great. I had a chicken gyro and fries and I really enjoyed it, my friend had the philly cheesesteak and it was also good. The staff was very friendly and I will definitely go back and try something different."}
{"text":"It was prepared well. Tasted great. I'd recommend to anyone looking for something quick outside of the normal fast-food chains."}
{"text":"Had the falafel gyro and also tried the chicken gyro.  Very tasty.  Lettuce and tomato very fresh and vibrant.
Came at the recommendation of my son, a JWU student and I look forward to coming back."}
{"text":"A good little lunch spot... too small for dine in but great for take-out.  The prices are very reasonable for what you get and I'm not sure there really is another gyro place in Uptown besides Showmars."}
{"text":"Super cute luv itt.  My coworkers talked about this place for so long and then I decided to give it a shot.  Love how small it is and how fast the food is made.  I got the greek salad with grilled chicken and it was so fresh and enjoyable on a sunny day.  Can't wait to go back for a gyro!"}
{"text":"This place cannot be beat for lunch. While in Charlotte, I eat lunch here almost every day for three reasons. 

1. The food is good. I believe I have had every single item on their menu and I have not been disappointed by any of them. I would say my favorites are the pork gyros, chicken sandwich and cheeseburger. However, the also make a great BLT and hot dog. And I always buy a brownie when they have them. They're fudgy, delicious and only $1.25

2. The service is super friendly and fast. There's always a line. Always. But the line is a sign of good food according to most food critics. Better yet. The line moves fast. Have your order ready when you get to the counter because they want to move you along. However, you'll never feel rushed because they're so friendly and helpful. 

3. Prices are unreal. There are several times I have to stop and ask to make sure they got my complete order. And they always do, but it's just so shocking how inexpensive they are for what you get. You can honestly get out of there with a cheeseburger, fries, drink and brownie for under $10. There have been many times that I spend $5-6 without a drink and we are talking about a lot of tasty food. Not fast food. 

It's a to go place with only a handful of tables so plan on eating elsewhere. There's a huge office campus a 1/2 block away with a hundred lunch tables and chairs. Or take it to your office or a nearby park for a picnic. Anyway you get it you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"I happen to work near LVG so I end up going here at least twice a week.  A pretty long menu that has all the typical short order food (burgers, fries, philly steak, etc.) However, if you don't get the pork gyro, then you are missing out on the point of this place.  The lamb/beef gyro is pretty good, but the pork one is amazing.  Flavorful, juicy, tangy....

This place has a couple small tables if you are a couple, but for the vast majority of people it is takeout food.  Don't be afraid of the long line out the door, because they have the food prepared very quickly for doing it all to order.  I don't think I have ever waited for more than 5 mins.

Prices are pretty cheap for what you are getting, but I guess if you don't have to have a dining room you can keep the prices low.

It would be a 5 star for me if they did have a dining room, but the food is most def a 5."}
{"text":"I only wish I had discovered this place on the first day of my trip.  I would've eaten every meal here.  Really really good."}
{"text":"Little hole in the wall location - not a place to sit & eat, and there's limited on-street parking, BUT the food was quick and delicious. The gyros were a bit unconventional but VERY good. Definitely worth a revisit. Next time we'll know to order two gyros apiece if we're hungry: they were that good. And we'll know what to order because dropping off the passenger to run in to order is a time saver."}
{"text":"This place is my favorite go-to lunch and dinner in Charlotte. You can't beat the value of everything on the menu. Quality ingredients, incredible portions and cheap prices! The double cheese burger, chicken gyro, fries, tuna sub and LVG salad are in my weekly rotation. The employees at LVG are always so friendly and quick!"}
{"text":"Def a hidden gem! My new fav place for gyros - the food truck near the intersection of Trade & Tryon used to be my go to but this has them beat by far! I've only had the gyros & Greek salad here but other food looks good as well. Taziki sauce is very garlicky (which I like) so don't forget gum/mints.  It's more of a grab & go place - seats are very limited. Staff is friendly & upbeat, ingredients are fresh & prices are fair! Line is out the door during lunch hour but it moves fast & there's not that long of a wait once order is placed. Also from listening to them call out their orders - I've learned I've been been pronouncing gyro's wrong all these years"}
{"text":"Gyro was delicious!!! Tiny place hidden but it was something worth it! From the fries inside the gyro, the side salad was really fresh and the tzaziki sauce! Highly recommented"}
{"text":"My go to greek in CLT! It's outside of the heart of uptown near the Johnson and Wales campus. At lunch time there is always a line, but it moves quick! The food is outstanding! I usually order the falafel. It's massive and SO SO SO fresh! The falafel is seasoned really well and then cooked to perfection. Juicy tomatoes, crisp lettuce and soft  warm pita bread. 

When my parents were visiting they wanted a quick and inexpensive meal one night. My dad ordered the cheesesteak and my mom ordered gyro... thy both loved it. 

Portions are large, food is cheap... quality is astounding!!"}
{"text":"Man! This place is awesome! Small with a couple of inside tables and a few outside tables, but the food is awesome and authentic! The prices are great and the service is too! Parking may be a bit challenging, but it's definitely worth it. It's small so expect a line especially if you go during the lunch rush. What we do is wait til after 2 when most people are back at work. The pork gyro is phenomenal and their fries are delicious! I will definitely be coming back for more!"}
{"text":"This is one of my go to spots uptown. Best falafel I have had in charlotte! They also have great french fries and chickpea salad. Plus, you can't beat the prices. There are only a couple 2 top tables inside, but they have a few bigger tables outside. If the weather isn't nice, plan on getting it to go."}
{"text":"Well I'm still on my low carb kick so when I went in and asked for a gyro without a pita they didn't stare at me like I had three heads ;)
They offered to put it on a bed of lettuce for me and rather than fries I was offered a garbanzo bean salad. The Gyro meat was really tasty as was the sauce and the garbanzo bean salad. All in with a drink my dinner was around $8. Although they were closing shortly they did not rush me out... in fact they invited me to sit, relax and take my time eating. Good energy here!"}
{"text":"The food here is delicious!   The service is even better, and the owners are super friendly!  I highly recommend the gyro (Greek-style with a few fries in it), and try the xoriatiki (Village Salad)."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch and it was my best decision of the week for lunch stops on a work trip. Got the lamb and beef gyro with fries. Fries were good, but I recommend adding the seasoned salt to get a bit more flavor. This is a very popular lunch spot, but don't let the long line deter you. They move through the line quickly and the cash register is right by the door, so a \"line going out the door\" might only mean two or three ahead of you. That's probably my only complaint - the menu is inside but you can't really see it until you're ordering, which can hold up the line if you don't know what to order."}
{"text":"Best gyros in charlotte! I've been to Greece, and these make me feel like I'm back there! Very authentic."}
{"text":"This is a really good GREEK place in CHARLOTTE! Food is awesome and great price!! The club sandwich and gyro are awesome. I just would like to see the music switched over to GREEK music instead of dirty south rap when I walk in here. Ruins the place the rap music from the one cashier  - she needs to work on her attitude.  Other than that LOVE THIS PLACE!!"}
{"text":"Visiting from Atlanta and had a hankering for a gyro. This place is delicious! Ordered the lamb gyro and garbanzo bean salad. This is a bold statement but I think it was the best gyro I've ever had in my life. The tzatziki sauce was incredible!"}
{"text":"I can't say enough good things about this place.  The food is amazing (my wife and I suspect they may be using some addictive narcotic as an ingredient, which is ok by me), the prices are awesome, service is quick, and THEY DELIVER.  Possibly the best value of any grab-n-go spot I've ever patronized... ever.  Thank you LVG!  You guys do an amazing job, please keep it up!"}
{"text":"This little gem serves up what I think are delicious gyros! One of the best lamb and beef gyros I've ever had.  Love the garbanzo salad. Very friendly staff, very cheap, and totally tasty!"}
{"text":"By far the very best Greek salad with grilled chicken  EVER!!!! The freshest pita bread also. My husband had beef and lamb gyro and LOVED it also said best he's ever had. Their pasta salad was very good as well, not soggy or drowning in dressing as some places. Their prices are extremely reasonable. I believe it to be an all take out type place but they do have a few patio tables should you choose to dine outdoors. This will certainly become one of our go to places. The staff were all very kind and our meal as ready in no time. You won't be disappointed dining here."}
{"text":"One of the best Gyros I have had in Charlotte, the ratio of ingredients is done to perfection. I hate biting into a gyro and getting all sauce and no meat, never had that problem at LVG. The Greek Potato salad is also amazing, I had never even heard of that before and have not seen it anywhere else to compare but I seriously doubt it will be easy to top theirs. I guess the one downside is the lack of seating but that has never been a problem for me."}
{"text":"This miniature gem is a hidden treasure in uptown charlotte. Well it's not really hidden because if you go during lunch you'll probably have a line going out the door!

My favorite here is the gyro (do a favor to yourself and get a dollar extra meat - it's totally worth it and still super cheap). They even give you a couple bonus fries that are the icing on the cake... and talking about fries, they are the best! Dip them in their garlicky taziki sauce and you'll be in heaven. Honestly that's the only thing I get there, I've never tried anything else."}
{"text":"I have been searching Charlotte for a delicious Gyro... and I am still searching. The meat was very greasy and did not sit well with my stomach. I was very optimistic based on the reviews.  Staff was great."}
{"text":"Went for lunch and got a small Greek salad.  There was more onions and tomato than lettuce.  The facility is across the street from greyhound bus station so you will get approached by the homeless."}
{"text":"Great food & service.  Prices are good and the grilled chicken gyro was delish!  The kids loved their food too."}
{"text":"Great spot for a quick take out lunch or dinner. We tried a grilled chicken gyro, regular gyro, and falafel pita- All were delicious! Line is long during lunch, but moves quickly."}
{"text":"This is one of the hidden gems of Charlotte. The food is reasonably priced and amazing. Two of my favorite things on the menu are the cheeseburger pita and the little village sub. Also everyone I've talked to can agree this place has the BEST fries in Charlotte!"}
{"text":"This is one of the best hidden gems in Charlotte.  A definite on the Gyro must go to list.  I actually love their Cheese Steak the most but you may have to stand in line if you go right at lunch time.  You can't really go wrong with anything here."}
{"text":"Love! Always go for the gyro, or the Greek salad with gyro meat. Every time my husband and I go, we are pleased with the quality of food and the service. We have been going for years and also think the prices are more than fair. The location is perfect for us but don't forget the deliver now."}
{"text":"Enjoy going here for a falafel sandwich. Not much seating but if you can get there before the crowd easy and delicious"}
{"text":"Ohhhhh emmmm geeeee!!! First of all only 4.5 stars?!?  This place could get 10 if they let me lol!  I was looking for lunch options on Yelp as I usually do, and came across this wonderful little slice of heaven!  I love Greek food, I love french fries, and I love tzatziki sauce lol.  This is the go to place for a Greek craving.  I am sure the salads which are highly pictured are delicious as the gyros, but I went the veggie burger route for my first time.  I walked from my job ( Duke Energy Center) to this place, about a 15 minute walk, and it was well worth it, plus the beautiful scenery.  

These fries.... Lawd, these fries... are amazing, one of my favorite styles of french fry!  Everything is made fresh!  The black bean burger was pretty dern good as well.  I hate beans, so it's a little weird that I even order black bean burgers and pick out the visible beans (it's a mental thing). BUT, it was really good, and very filling.  Next time I come here, I'm going to get the salad!  I hope the Greek dressing is as good as it looks!"}
{"text":"I've had a few people recommend this place, so when I found myself in Uptown at lunchtime I stopped in.

It's a tiny space, 3 small tables to the side of the counter and 2 outside.  You order and then wait for them to call your number.  I took it Togo to eat at the Johnston & Wales courtyard.  

I ordered the chicken gyro and my husband ordered the regular gyro, with a side of fries and potato salad.  The reason I am giving them 4 instead of 5 is that there was barely any chicken on my chicken gyro and it was disappointing because I could tell it would be good.  Everything else was great and the prices are pretty good too. I will try them again!"}
{"text":"You get a lot from this small place!  The Gyros are pretty good whether it is the Lamb & Beef, Pork or chicken.  Event their burgers are not bad.  
It is amazing how such a small place can move the orders so quickly.  Don't let the line intimidate you because you won't be waiting very long.
I only wish they had iceberg lettuce in addition to the romaine.  The stalky romaine does not fit well with their sandwiches in most scenarios."}
{"text":"Super small place with just a few tables inside and a few tables on the sidewalk out front.  Hands down, best gyro I've had in Charlotte--they even put a couple of fries inside.  They have great baklava, and I like the greek salad with gyro meat on top (especially with tzatziki instead of salad dressing)."}
{"text":"Today was my first time at Little Village. Definitely a grab and go place, meaning there is really no sitting inside, which is fine with me. I ordered the Little Village sub, fries, and baklava. Everyone is correct, the fries are delicious. The baklava is amazing- not too sweet and very buttery. I gave them a 4 star because the sub was just ok. The oil and vinegar was really good but the meat isn't really seasoned, so you really need some sort of seasoning on it. I will definitely return to try some other items. I'm definitely a fan!!"}
{"text":"What a pleasant surprise. This is strictly food as mine order was to go.  I typically avoid Gyro meat because it's super salty but I needed a quick meal and this place drew me in because they have the option of having a whole wheat wrap so I got the gyro and much to my dismay it's not noticeably salty at all and has amazing flavor.  I got a salad in addition and the chicken on the salad is so tender and flavorful and that it almost didn't even need the dressing definitely will be returning on my next Charlotte visit."}
{"text":"This place rocks! I am amazed every time we go here.  The service, the food,  the price you can't beat it! I wish we lived closer to it, but then again, it makes it all that more special every time we're able to stop by. don't miss this place!"}
{"text":"Just started working in a building close by and all my coworkers told me I needed to try this place. I am not a big gyro fan but I like them... This place made me a gyro fan, the chicken was perfectly cooked, the sauce is great! Fries are amazing and pasta salad is also great! This place is a hidden gem. Food is amazing, people are extremely nice and prices are hard to beat!
Will be having lunch here more often!"}
{"text":"3.5 STARS!

I literally just came here for lunch....in fact, I'm still picking at the French fries as I write this review.... The French fries are AWESOME...very crispy on the outside, but somewhat soft on the inside.

I placed an order to go.... I ordered the chicken Gyro w/ the side of fries & a soda. 
The chicken was seasoned nicely...lettuce, tomato, onion and tzatziki was standard... not the best Gyro, but not the worst either. 

The entire meal was $7 bucks so you can't beat the price. Staff was very friendly. The place is small but they do have some tables if you decide to eat there.
I will definitely try this place again and make sure that I eat there. 

When I do, I will make sure to submit an updated review."}
{"text":"I used to eat here all the time when I lived uptown.  Best little grill in town!  Awesome gyro!"}
{"text":"We were in Charlotte for the Panthers/Saints game and this place was amazing! The gyros were sure fresh and the taziki sauce was probably the best I've ever had! Definitely worth a stop if you are looking for quality at a great price!"}
{"text":"Quick service, great food and really decent pricing.  Not much seating on site but they do have a few tables and chairs.  Perfect for grab and go food!"}
{"text":"Little Village Grill may not look like much from the outside, and it's not exactly on the most happening street in Charlotte, but looks can be deceiving. 

Its menu isn't exactly extensive, either, but if you're in the mood for some quick food that doesnt taste cheap or unhealthy, or if you're looking to save up some cash for a fancier night out, LV Grill is the place to head. I always go with the Gyro; it's always perfect. The cheesburger pita is actually really good, too, but if you're picking up dinner, definitely stay with the easy Greek stuff. Good falafel, good gyros, good chicken wraps. All come with french fries, which isn't exactly authentic, but pretty tasty nonetheless. 

There's only a table or two inside, so don't plan on eating at the Grill. It's a strictly pick-up spot as far as I'm concerned. Again, though, it gets the job done when you're hungry. Grab a drink after you're done at the bar next door..."}
{"text":"I'm from nyc so I had my share of great gyros. This is the best gyro I'm Charlotte!! Great service very friendly."}
{"text":"Really solid Gyro...maybe the best in Charlotte. They put fries in there's, but they will gladly leave them out.  

A lot of people just pick up their order, because there is very little seating outside.  Longer lines at lunch, but they get the food out quick."}
{"text":"Small hole in the wall on the outskirts of Uptown. Some of the better Mediterranean food I've had in Charlotte and very affordable. They do use a lot of garlic which I like but others around me won't. Not many tables inside and a few larger tables outside. I recommend the lamb and beef gyro. Also the full size salad is a huge portion for only $5. If you get the side salad, it's significantly less and about $3."}
{"text":"Hands down best burgers in the city. The food is always excellent and so is the service"}
{"text":"Went here today for the first time with one of my classmates (he recommended it). It's small, but definitely gets its share of traffic especially at lunchtime. Like I said, it's a pretty small place. You order (most seem to order takeout), there's a drink machine, a couple of tables for 2, and a restroom. But it's clean and the employees there are very friendly.

The food comes out quick and it's delicious. There's a good selection too! burgers, subs, salads, gyros and good sides too. pasta salad, slaw, fries...I had the little village sub and a side order of pasta salad and a soda. The sub was fantastic. It's kind of like their take on a cheesesteak. My friend ordered the gyro (which seems like the most popular lunch item), fries and a drink. He enjoyed his too. The best thing about our meals were that they were delicious, they came out fast, the portions were pretty generous too. (I posted a pic of my meal) AND my meal was under $10.

It's not the place to go if you want to sit and catch up with friends and have a long conversation-filled lunch. But if you're hungry and are looking for a quick, delicious meal to go with fast food prices, here's your place. I'd definitely go there again in a heartbeat!"}
{"text":"Every single time I go to Little Village, I'm greeted with kind faces and speedy service. Along with these two positive things, the food tastes great and the prices are affordable for even college students. Their fries and brownies are just simply amazing--they give A LOT of fries for just $1.85. Love this place a lot."}
{"text":"Where is the sixth star???  Fabulous little place!  Keyword for some will be \"little\", three indoor 2tops and two outdoor 4tops.  Food is AMAZING though... Great for grab and go!!!"}
{"text":"Great service.  I have an allergy to some foods and they were nice enough to work with me and give me some alternatives!   

Had the Gyro, which was awesome, with their homemade Greek dressing.   Great food and service.  Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Best gyro in all of charlotte. They deliver after 4 on weekdays. Affordable and so delicious."}
{"text":"I really like LVG.  It is close for me to walk to at lunch, the prices and food are great.  I particularly like their cheeseburger but you an also get it \"carolina style\" which has chili, mustard, slaw and onions.  Their chili is very good, also on a carolina dog.  You can park in the deck next to the shop for free for 30 minutes or less if you have to drive.  Only time I don't like this place is when they close for a week or two and go on vacation!!!"}
{"text":"For fast easy quality food nothing is better than Little Village Grill. Great ingredients equals great food that feels healthy and good in your body. And if you want to add chili cheese fries those are pretty delicious too!"}
{"text":"Cute little restaurant on the corner! Amazing food and amazing service! very friendly staff! and very reasonable prices! would recommend to everyone."}
{"text":"One of the best grab and go places in town. I reserve this for a treat because it is located by my building and I avoid the temptation of the crispy fries for every once in a while. I have liked all the menu items I have tried. Great gyros. Quick service."}
{"text":"Oh WOW.

This place is amazing. I am visiting from Chicago and ordered this for delivery through doordash. I found this place through searching yelp and it did not disappoint. My eyes were bigger than my stomach and I ordered the greek salad with gyro meat, greek potato salad, and the hotdog. I know what you're thinking, why would I order a hotdog from a Greek restaurant? Well, I'm from Chicago and I guess it's in my nature. Regardless, it was so good. The potato salad and greek salad were really good too.

Overall, highly recommend. Five stars, hands down."}
{"text":"I cannot wait to get back to Charlotte. We went on Saturday and tried to go back on Sunday but they were closed. So disappointed.  My pregnant daughter was craving another chicken gyro.  We ordered 2 chicken, the lamb and beef, and a hamburger for my son. After seeing our food he wished he had chosen a gyro. The French fries are dropped per order. They were lovely."}
{"text":"I think their gyro, especially at $4 is a great deal. They make it quick and the meat is moist and fresh (tasting... you never know with those giant cones).

I'm not going to say it's like amazing food and you should go here instead of kings kitchen or something but at 4.25 a pop, you can do this a lot more often and still be quite satisfied and sometimes that's worth 5 stars."}
{"text":"We LOVE this place!  I always get the falafel pita and we share an order of fries.  These fries are so delicious!  The baklava is yummy...when it's not sold out!"}
{"text":"Great gyro's they add fries as an added touch inside salads very fresh tasting. The prices are great. Not an eat in place very small. The service is quick so u can get in and get out usually packed during lunch time though."}
{"text":"Small little place with minimal seating but what they lack in space, they make up in flavor and quantity. We got a double cheeseburger, 4 servings of fries (delicious, crispy but not too greasy), tzatziki sauce for the fries, and some gyro with lamb I believe. The gyro was phenomenal, texture was soft, flavors were combined well. Me and my brother can both eat a lot and we had hard time finishing (it was 3 of us, not just 2), which is a good sign when combined with good service, swift preparation, clean bathrooms (props for that), and tasty and good food. Prices are spot on. Definitely recommended.

One tip, though. During a sunny day, it's not the best idea to leave the condiments sitting outside on the tables. From a consumer perspective - no thanks, I don't know how long it's been sitting there, not even mentioning the possible health hazzard of sun frying some of the ketchup or mustard bottles."}
{"text":"Y-U-M!! Small and inviting! Steady stream of customers to this mostly takeout with cute patio seating and lighting.  Squishy seating inside but it's all about the food.  Loved it!. And they even put the fries IN the pita!!"}
{"text":"I love having this place nearby when I just don't feel like cooking dinner! However, they close at 8pm, which is usually too early for me to get there. I like the greek salad and the chicken pita....and the fries. Even when I get a salad I still get the fries. Health. I feel like the quality is a little inconsistent, but its so cheap!! Well worth it."}
{"text":"This is one of my absolute favorite places in Charlotte. A great hidden gem in the Gateway area of uptown. The food is not only delicious, but also so affordable!! 

There's always a line at lunchtime, but don't let that discourage you. They crank out food and it goes quickly. It's a small place with a few tables inside and out front. I typically get my food to go. They also deliver 4-8pm inside the 277 loop. 

I love the chicken gyros. The Greek salad with chicken is usually enough for me to divide in half for two meals. I'm not one who normally orders fries as a side, but I do here. They are just plain stupid good. I can also never stop eating them, even if I'm beyond full. The menu is full of burger, sub, and pita options. There's even falafel, if you're into that kind of thing. Last week, I got the lamb burger special (also, yum I hope this becomes a permanent menu item at some point), a chicken gyro, two orders of fries, and two drinks for around $16. Steal. 

John and Cindy really put their hearts and soul into this place. LVG just celebrated its 11 year anniversary. Here's to the next 11."}
{"text":"I love this place so much! They're consistent, great prices and their gyros are AMAZING. I've tried the lamb and chicken and both were just agdjjrksnwkfirndiwnjr flipping awesome. The pita bread is so soft and delicious and the ingredients all seem very fresh. I've also tried their baklava and it was pretty good. The fries are also a pretty good choice for their price. I've moved an hour away but if I'm around downtown I'll make it a point to stop in."}
{"text":"Undoubtedly, the tastiest gyro, fries and small Greek salad that I have had in recent memory!  Service was excellent, as well. They certainly act like they love what they're doing. If they don't, you sure wouldn't know it!

I will definitely return next time in Charlotte and craving Mediterranean!"}
{"text":"I've had better more flavorful chicken gyro's, but for $8, the greek salad/chicken gyro combo sure beats any combo deal at Subway or Quiznos.

If I wasn't watching what I ate, I'd probably go for the chili cheese fries and a burger - looked amazing. Service quick and friendly, place was clean, seats are limited. Note: they sell these decadent looking brownies too.... 

Accepts Visa/Mastercard and Cash."}
{"text":"Hands down the best, crispiest fries around. And their gyros are ouuuuuuut of this world good. Small place with minimal seating. But the lines move quick, the food is fast and fresh and the staff is always friendly. 

Seriously, a hidden gem of charlotte. You'll never be disappointed grabbing a quick, cheap meal here."}
{"text":"Nice hidden spot for a good grilled burger or similar. They needed to change the syrup in the drink machine but the food was hot, taste good and service was cool."}
{"text":"Love this little place, staff is always asking if you need anything and food comes out super quick, the flavors are spot on, the down size is how small and limited seating is, proble should try to keep it a little cleaner, prices are spot on, you haven't tried it give it a shot"}
{"text":"Had the wheat gyro....yummy.  staff was very friendly, super clean kitchen & head. Homemade tzatziki sauce made the day.  Baklava was sweltastic also."}
{"text":"Simply Fabulous.  We've been in Charlotte for over two decades and just recently discovered this place it's definitely worth stopping by."}
{"text":"The gyros are good and the prices are even better! $6 something for a chicken gyro and a soda! The line gets long but even with a few ppl in front of you, you can order and have your food within 5-7 mins- super quick! And they take Apple Pay which is a bonus!"}
{"text":"Easily the best place to grab lunch uptown. 

Don't be scared by the line.  It moves quick.  And the food comes out hot and fresh. 

The staff is excellent. And the price is perfect. 

You will love LVG.   Check em out!"}
{"text":"For years, I've been hearing about this \"little hole in the wall in uptown that has the best gyros\". I mentioned this to my boyfriend, who said he had never heard of this place. As fate would have it, last weekend we ended up nearby and hungry so decided to try it and it was a great decision!

I had the gyro with fries and it was sooooooooo good. They even threw some fries on the gyro, which is just the way they did it when I was in Greece! The fries were really good also. 
My boyfriend went with the ever so authentic philly cheese steak and raved about it. He also enjoyed the fries. 

Seating is kinda rough but it's worth it. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Had the lamb and beef Gyro for lunch. Very tasty! Quick, courteous, service. Very limited seating though. More of a take out place. Would definitely go again!"}
{"text":"This place never disappoints!  It is truly a really  good place to eat and I personally think the best gyro in all of Charlotte. 

The best thing about this place is the food is really affordable without sacrificing quality. 

My recommendations to try on this menu are the veggie or lamb and beef gyro , a salad , and the fries are crispy!

This is the best kept secret that really isn't one anymore if you are reading this now! It is like a Pringle, once you eat one you got to have more! 

There really isn't another place that comes close!"}
{"text":"Just moved here a couple months back and I try to eat here at least once a week. Great gyros for a great price. Amazing potato salad. Good brownies. I just wish they did fresh cut fries that didn't have flour on them. Maybe even oregano fries like some NYC Greek restaurants do."}
{"text":"Loved the food! Authentic seasoning, the gyro was delicious I enjoyed every bite. It reminded me of the gyro I ate in Athens.  Amazing customer service. I will definitely come back when I am in town."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic. The food here will blow your mind. The location is great and easy to get too."}
{"text":"I have been coming to Little Village for several years now. I used to love the burgers and hot dogs with chili but after giving up beef and pork. I tried the grilled chicken sub and fell in love. The chicken is always fresh, it is juicy and tender. Definitely my new favorite."}
{"text":"This is such a cute little place tucked in Charlotte! I've always been a fan of gyros, and this place definitely makes them exceptionally. Its cooked to order, with very cheap prices, and the option to add a drink and fries for a dollar or two extra. The portion of the food is definitely enough to fill me, and I can be pretty stuffed if I get the fries as well. This place definitely offer great value for the price you pay and the quality of food you recieve. A few down sides, very limited sitting, inside the small restaurant, there was only about 6-8 seats, they also have outside seating I believe, but that won't be very helpful during the colder months. They also unfortunately charge an extra 75 cents for tzatziki sauce which is a nuisance not knowing that at the counter and having to dig for change on my way back. However, I definitely think that this is a great affordable lunch spot in Charlotte, but more tailored for on the go / take out type restaurant. Either way dine in or dine out, I would highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Cheap and great quality. Short lines, friendly service. 10/10 recommend, will be going back."}
{"text":"Great, inexpensive place to grab a bite to eat! Was recommended to this place by a friend and now I go almost every other week. I usually get the Gyro (which they put a couple fries on...delicious!!) and my boyfriend normally gets a cheeseburger which he says compares to Five Guys (and that's good in our book!) Definitely give it a shot."}
{"text":"This place is so incredibly simple and so incredibly good. I had a gyro here a few days ago, and I'm STILL thinking about it. Absolutely delicious. A must try for all."}
{"text":"Its hard to get 5 stars out of me and I don't always have valid reasons but this place came VERY close to getting 5 stars.  

I love the fact that it is hidden to some extent and the fact that it is small.  After living in NY for several years I learned  to appreciate these types of restaurants/cafes.  The price is right and the portions are perfect!  

I ordered the falafel and I like Kabob Grill's better BUT this was a VERY good wrap and I love the fact that it was offered on a wheat pita.  I wish it had hummus or tahini sauce on it but they went a different route.... They put onion, tomato, lettuce and tzatziki on theirs...which was still great!  I didn't try the fries but the people next to me no doubt caught me peeping their plate...the fries looked amazing!!  I should have just asked them for one.  lol!

My friend got the cheeseburger pita wrap, which was unique in and of itself!  He thoroughly enjoyed it!!  He even paid a compliment to the chef after his last bite with a loud belch.  Once again, the people beside us must have thought were were incredibly wack.  But, we enjoyed OUR meals!  

The best part of it all was the price.  I appreciate the fact that they serve fresh, tasy grub for a reasonable price.  Hats off to them and I WILL be back!!"}
{"text":"Beef and lamb gyro was as good as any I've ever had.

While French fries are nothing to get excited about, theirs are perfectly cooked and seasoned and leave nothing to be desired.

And the whole experience cost less than $7."}
{"text":"Really good. I mean the fries are hot. The sandwiches are not too messy. Not much seating. Fast service. Tasted fresh and the pita was soft."}
{"text":"For a quick, go-to Greek fix this place is hard to beat in Uptown Charlotte. I enjoyed the dress made Greek potato salad and warm Gyro on my first visit and a big Greek salad with Gyro meat my second visit. Staff is super friendly and I'll definitely be back for more."}
{"text":"The staff here is always really friendly. 

- Fries (as if they pump air in them before they hit the fryer) the crunch you hear when you bite into them. They have the best fries in Charlotte.

- The Little Village sub is one of my go-to items as the flavor is top notch. Try to eat it there is possible or within 30 minutes, they add a bit of vinegar that adds to the flavor but can also cause your sandwich to go a bit limp if left un-wrapped for an extended period of time.

- Try the cheese steak! Ma, where's the grease? Because it's not to be found on this sandwich. So good and paired best with the fries. 

- Coleslaw is really good, not too sweet, has a nice bite and if you want to change things up a bit, put a bit on your sub (man, that's what's \"sub\"!) 
- Double Cheeseburger Pita, makes you happy you went with 2 patties over 1! 

- Sweet Tea the way it should be presented to anyone trying sweet tea for the 1st time. It's not watered down, has a nice tea taste and I challenge you not to top off before you leave! So good that it needs to sold by the gallon!

- I didn't want to lead with this since everyone seems to leave a review about it (and they should because it's really good!)The lamb and beef gyro! Suprise, you may find a fry or a few in your gyro which add a nice bite to the protein it's wrapped around! 

I can go on and on about the other items but I am sure most read just a few lines and went to the next review. 

Cliffnote Version: Little Village Grill is small, seating for around 8 inside and if it's nice out, another 8 outside. Lines move fast so if it's out the door, just know that the counter is about 6 feet from the front of the door so it may only be about a 5-7 minute wait. The staff is super busy but they greet you with a smile and the front counter never rushes you as you glance at the menu for any additional items you may want to stock up on at the office for another meal or round two for dinner or lunch the next day! The quality and flavors are great, prices are perfect, customer service is friendly, yeah... this place is a WINNER whenever you are looking for a bite! 

Enjoy your 1st, next, many continuous trips to Little Village Grill!"}
{"text":"Really good Greek salad, cheap prices, good portions I got the turkey gyro it was grilled so it made it even better. Nice little spot. Limited seating.."}
{"text":"Very good Gyro and fries.  Prices are reasonable.  It's small and usually has a line outside of the door."}
{"text":"I haven't had anything here that I didn't like! From black bean burgers to grilled chicken subs to Greek salad to double cheese burger pita.. There's so many choices & you can't go wrong! And if you like fries you will LOVE there's! It's a must that you add on a side of them with your burger or sub! And what makes it even better... the price! Everything is reasonably priced, perfect place for lunch!"}
{"text":"When I'm at Gateway, this spot is my jam.  Everything is good.  The Greek Salad w/ Chicken.  The Pita bread w/ Tzatziki sauce.  The BLT.  The Chicken Gyro.  The Brownie.  Even the hamburger.  PHENOM.

& the freaking fries are my favorite in all of Charlotte.  Not even kidding.

I recommend calling ahead - don't plan on eating here, there really isn't any seating, but it's a to-die-for take-out joint.

One flaw?  The parking deck next door now charges, even if you are just running in (they used to let the first 15 minutes go free)."}
{"text":"Found this place by accident , love the grilled chicken greel salad. They are quick here too!"}
{"text":"I agree with Nikki, the Little Village Grill is one of Charlotte's hidden gems. It's tucked away in a small takeout location off of trade street, there are a couple of tables in front and 2-3 tiny ones inside but, very cramped. Who cares.. The food is worth it! I ordered the falafel pita while the bf got his usual chicken gyro with a side of fries. The best part: the amazingly affordable price. My falafel wrap wasn't even 5 bucks... Bravo! Food came out quick and hot. All the veggies were fresh. The falafel was a little soggy but, flavorful. The tzaziki is a good call here. I couldn't finish and had to take half back. The fries are so crunchy delicious! 

They are open till 8p on the weekdays.. This will be my new I'm-too-lazy-to-cook place if I can remember before they close! This place is a must try in Charlotte! Cheers!"}
{"text":"This is a great place to grab a Mediterranean/Greek l on the good that is delicious and fast. 

Not to mention the staff is EXCELLENT. They are so efficient and can work in sync to get everyones food out in a timely manner. 

They do not offer parking, so you will need to park on the street or a nearby lot. 

What I've had: 

Greek Salad with Chicken: Love this salad! They use Romaine and not ice-burg which I like. Their chicken is tender and nicely marinated.

Black Bean Burger - Fantastically seasoned and super tasty! This one takes a while to cook, so don't order if you're in a hurry. 

Gyros - I've had the lamb, chicken, and pork. I enjoy the lamb and pork one because they throw a couple fries inside. Their to tzatziki sauce is very good! 

If you want a side go with their Greek pasta salad.

Seating is limited, approx 3 tables for 2 people inside, three tables for 4 outside. 

Their prices are also extremely affordable!"}
{"text":"It's pretty small and ALWAYS packed at lunch time, so if you're pressed for time you may want to get here early, but there's always a long line out of the door for a reason. The food is always hot and seasoned very well, they give Five Guys a run for their money with the fries and their Gyros are delectibly fresh and flavorful."}
{"text":"Food is great here and super cheap!! I highly recommend the chicken pita! For 4.80 you can't beat it!!"}
{"text":"Great place to grab a quick bite. Never disappointed with anything I get from them. Staff is friendly and food comes out quick. Glad I discovered this little gem."}
{"text":"I love this lace! I can honestly say you must try their gyro sandwich!!! So good and the fries are so good too. My girlfriend lives all the food she gets however I always get the gyro and nothing to me is better. I have to say their other food is very good too I am just a gyro sandwich guy so there is what I can't get enough of. You must stop in even for a brownie it's all very good."}
{"text":"I work near LVG and I've eaten here at least 30 times for lunch.  This place is an absolute gem.  This is definitely more of a takeout place.  There is very limited seating inside (6 seats?) with a few tables outside.  Inside is very cramped but they've done a good job of maximizing the space.  There's a very specific rhythm to the way people move from register to fountain drink dispenser, to waiting for your food.  

Service is always friendly and fast.  Stop by with any regularity and they know your name and your order.  Prices are very reasonable.  The owner and his wife are awesome and really care about their customers.  The best part is the food.  I typically order the Greek salad with chicken or gyro meat or the chicken gyro.  The gyro meat is super savory and the salads are always really crisp.  The chicken gyro is really tasty with a warm soft pita.   Whenever I have coworkers come from out of town I always take them here for lunch. The only negative thing is that there can be long lines out the door at lunchtime.  I try to stop by right at 12:00 or after 1:00."}
