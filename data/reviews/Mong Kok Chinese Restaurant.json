{"text":"Food quality and service are pretty consistent here, and in line with other Cantonese style dim sum places in the area, however, this past weekend we found that the normally more expensive dim sum selections (anything that has shrimp, or ones priced as a medium or an large) were scarce during the \"morning tea special\" time slot, before 11am, but were suddenly plentiful after the prices return to the regular price, after 11am. Go figure."}
{"text":"This is a decent Dimsum place in Markham.  I would come back soon because of the price.  They have push carts but only for pastries and fried things.  $2.38 during off peak hours: 8a to 11a then 1:30p to 4p."}
{"text":"Food was excellent BUT service was not great.   Ordered yang chow, noodles Cantonese, sweet n sour pork and fried chicken.   Seasoned perfectly but they miss my order of Hot and Sour soup.   Started to give us our mains before the soup.   Reason was that they forgot my order.  Will eat here again coz food was awesome!"}
{"text":"Decent chinese food.  I've had dim sum and dinner here and food was good, but not very memorable.  Everything kinda tastes the same.  Perhaps they use the same marinade in everything?  Price is ok or slightly less than average.  Lunch of 10 to 12 dishes would cost about $35.  Would return here when I can't think of other places to try.  It's ok but doesn't stand out."}
{"text":"Highly recommend the stir fried beef ho fan (flat noodles) with taro crisp layered generously on top. Once mixed in, it offers much more flavor and texture to the noodles. I suggest also trying their BBQ pork with rice - good portion and also very succulent! Moreover, the chef's are more skilled in making dishes on the wok than their steamed dim sum."}
{"text":"Horrible place for dimsum.  Came here at 1pm on a Sunday,  and was seated fairly quickly. We sat there for about 1 hour,  and we did not even have the standard ha-gow or siu-mai pushed by.   Left hungry, got fed up waiting for standard items."}
{"text":"I feel like they have improved since last year. Seems to be new chefs for dinner and dim sum. Definitely a lot better food quality then the past. Service is alright. Decent for a Chinese restaurant."}
{"text":"Currently here writting a review on how slow and rude the service can be.  Yes we were seated pretty quickly on a Monday, but wow the food took literally 20-30mins for each dim sum order to arrive..   I've asked 3 different waitresses and waiters to check on my order cause my beef tripe took 1hr !!!! 1hr!!!to arrive we already finished everything!! I was already so frustrated each time I asked a waitress or waiter they either don't respond back or they say \"don't worry it will be here soon\" yeah right... !!    So food was nothing special didn't taste the greatest!! And definetly not the highest quality !! Not to mention the variety sucks !!!    Definetly not coming back unless there's no other choice !!!"}
{"text":"I've been here multiple times for dim sum. The first thing you'll notice when you walk in is that this place is HUGE! It's about 3-4 times the size of the Chinese restaurants near where I live.   This place is pretty traditional. They do dim sum by carts which is becoming extinct in the GTA these days. But one drawback is that depending on where you sit, you might not get that much traffic. Fortunately this place is always busy and the kitchen  makes a lot of stuff. If there's something you really want and don't see it on carts, you can always flag down a server and order it. Of course, you need to speak Chinese to do this.   In terms of quality and selection, I think this place is good. Dim sum has variety and it's natural that a few dishes will be off every once in a while. Of the 3 times I've been here, I find the quality consistent. The selection is also very good. They have my favourite dim sum: quail egg, which is a rare find in GTA. They will also randomly have special kitchen dishes in dim sum portions. Last time I ordered a sea cucumber pot and it was just $4.99 which is a steal.   As usual, don't expect attentive service in a Chinese place. It's culture. The staff aren't going to smile at you much or ask you how you're doing. They'll just do their job and get your fed and refill your tea.  Prices are reasonable too. Their regular dim sum price is $2.68. They don't do the small, medium large thing. They also have special dishes at $3.99, $4.99, and $5.99. It's not the the finest Chinese food but it'll be more than sufficient for the average person. The only reason I don't come here more often is due to distance. Otherwise this would be my default dim sum place."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner with my family on Friday.  We got one of their set menus and added on a few dishes.    I've been here before for dim sum also, and I can say that dinner is only marginally better.  Any robbers who need to dine and dash should eat here.  The food comes out like its pumped out of an assembly line.  Our lazy susan was so overcrowded that all our glasses clinked together and toasted each other when we turned it.  It was definitely an aggressor, knocking out all dinnerware that crossed its path.  The restaurant wasn't even busy - so why the food was coming out so fast can only be explained (at least in my mind) by this one rationale - if the chef finished pumping out the food, they can pay him one hour less.  :p  The food itself was okay.  The sweet and sour pork came in such small pieces that you got more batter than actual meat.  The salty and spicy slices of squid was inconsistent, with some pieces being overly cooked and thus chewy and others being fine.  The seafood soup lacked any real intense flavour, and all I could taste was the chicken broth and a whole lot of thickener.  The yee mein was bland and boring.    All in all, pretty mediocre food coupled with overcrowding - I felt like a future piece of foie gras being force fed by my villainous captors!"}
{"text":"The setting kinda reminds me of the long time existing Chinese Restaurant near Sheppard and Midland called Scarborough Grand Seafood Restaurant. The GOLD borders, frames as well as the Chandeliers very reminiscent. Obviously it is much newer decor so has that comfort feel. It helps that the seats are new and nicely cushioned.   If you notice CLOSELY, the whole space can be separated in 5+ sections by removable dividers and if you can imagine it then you will notice each section has it's own WEIRD theme but it's only the wall setting that makes it so. One of them is some Maple Leaves of sorts.   $2.60 for PRIME(11-1:30) Dim Sum period while $2.30 at off peak hours(8-11, 1:30-4(?)) is definitely something to pay attention to but the food is A-OK. The menu is pretty standard Dim Sum items nothing unusual or creative.   Har Gow(Shrimp Dumping) is all SHRIMP didn't taste any other ingredients or flavourings and the skin is acceptable I guess.   Siu Mai(Pork & Shrimp Dumpling) is nicely sized with COOKED and normal Tobiko on top with whole Shrimps inside and the Pork mince is very smoothly grounded.   Steamed Beef Tendon with Chu Hou Sauce is fine as well as there is still good bite back at the center so it's not just PURE soft gelatin. Lots of noticeable Chopped Garlic on top but didn't taste Garlicky at all.   Steam Rice Roll with Dough Fritter is SO-SO. Kind of hard to separate the pieces even with my expert Chopsticking. The Dough Fritter was kind of flat. It is what it is?   Definitely not my FIRST choice or even second but if some friends or relatives wants to try I will go along for the ride."}
{"text":"A typical dim-sum place, nothing special or outstanding about it.  The quality of their dimsum is really regular, and for the price they charge, it's a bit on the high end.  It really depends on your luck, if the items rolled out are the ones you like.  And depending on where you're sitting you might have more carts pushed by you, or the food might be hotter when it gets to you.  Service is really mediocre and some of the waitresses here can be horrible.  Once they put us right near the door, where lots of cold air was coming in, even though there were plenty of tables inside.  She looked extremely pissed and unwilling when we requested a switch, so the service really depends.    Some of their dimsum items are somewhat unique/different from the run-of-the-mill ones, but beware that those come out sporadically and that their prices are usually higher than the typical prices!"}
{"text":"Thoroughly disappointed. Went in with high expectations as it was packed, but the food was bland. Even Toronto Chinatown dim sum tastes better - now that says a lot. The shrimp in the har gaw was tenderized to the nth degree leaving any trace of shrimp flavor not to be found.  Sui Mai was passable and no complaints there. Egg tarts were sad though!  I expect small warm and flakey tarts. What came were smaller than small and hard & dry crusted tarts. And they couldn't even get the filling right - what up with that? For the price they charge and food they serve don't know why they are so busy. Add it to one of those unsolved mysteries. For me I'm never going back."}
{"text":"This place have some interesting dimsum that we don't get in the States.  - cotton chicken -- its a yummy tender steam chicken;  - fish dumpling - at first I thought it was fish fillet wrap but turns out it's just flour make to look like fish - gogi lychee cake - this was yummy; very good lychee flavor  the seaweed roll, seafood pancake, pumpkin chicken congee, and mushroom steam noodle were ok but not impressive"}
{"text":"10 course chinese banquet review:  It's good. Nothing amazing, but everything is average.  The best part is probably the mango jellies and almond cookies at the end.  Service is what you would expect from very busy wait staff serving tons of people. Lacking in depth, but fast and efficient."}
{"text":"This review is based on a dining experience.    Disclaimer: I got price tag shock.  Most items are priced between $15 to $30.  Maybe I should have expected this price level based on the decoration, but I didn't.  Hence, I must confess that, food wise, this dinner might not showcase the skills of the chefs, because we only ordered the least expensive items.  We ordered a Sweet and Sour Chicken ($11), a Baby Boy Choi Stir Fried with Salted Fish ($11) and a Steamed Tilapia Fish With Soy Sauce (daily special $11).  Everything tasted average.  Nothing stood out as impressive or bad.  The portion was reasonable.  The batter of the Sweet and Sour Chicken could be thinner.  The Baby Boy Choi was well made, fresh and tasty.  i recommend the Tilapia daily special because it is an exceptional deal.    I must sing praises for the services.  Not only was it prompt, it was extended in manner beyond what i would expect from a family dining restaurant.  For example, each diner had a plate.  The plates were replaced twice with new ones because there were some fish bones on them.  We were maybe half way through the fish when they replaced the plates the first time.  The plate that held the fish itself was removed within a minute after we were finished with the fish.  The teapot was quickly refilled.  I have an impression that Ming Kok Chinese Restaurant aims to be a middle-high end restaurant.  This observation is based on the decoration, the services level and the price point.  The food quality didn't stand out in my visit, but it could be because we didn't order anything that required finesse."}
{"text":"Old school push cart dim sum. Some items were good and other items could use some improvement. The one that really stood out for me was the coconut steamed milk dessert. I have never seen one of these before so I had to try it even though it was $5.99  I thought it had the prefect sweetness. The steamed milk was silky smooth. The coconut jelly was soft and tasty. Service was quick and items came strolling around pretty fast. The place is pretty big and spacious so didn't even have to line up considering it was a Saturday morning. I'm pretty sure most other dim sum places would have long line ups."}
{"text":"Well, it's certainly not the best Chinese restaurant in Markham. In terms of what they do best, they do quite well. Note that I've only been here for dinner so I can only judge such.  I started this dinner with a shredded crab with scallop soup, which was quite good. The peking duck, which followed, was also excellent. The lobster was average, but I'm not a huge lobster fan to start. We also ordered fried rice, which was easily the biggest disappointment of the meal, as there was way too much water embedded in the dish. Finally, the general tso chicken was acceptable.  Service was poor to start, as we were unattended for about 30 minutes after we ordered. We had to get the manager to see what happened to our meals, and turns out the original waiter didn't take down our order to the kitchen. That was eventually solved and everything came in within 10 minutes.  As I said, there are better Chinese restaurants around. However this place isn't terrible if you happen to stumble here."}
{"text":"Came here with the fellas at peak time(1 PM on a Saturday). My friend got a table after two minutes. The restaurant is reviewed for the following conditions; atmosphere, cleanliness, food quality and customer service.  The restaurant is a regular tacky Chinese restaurant. It has the usual carpet and chandeliers. It's probably one of the biggest dim sum restaurant I've been to in terms of spacing. It's nothing special but I've seen worse. 0.5/1 Star  In terms of cleanliness, the utensils and cutlery appeared clean but the floor would have a bit of trash such as tissue and toothpicks. 0.5/1 Star  The food quality was decent. I was expecting regular dim sum food and that is what I got. I had spare ribs, honey garlic beef ribs, beef tripe and marinated chicken feet. Again, nothing special but still good. My friend's ordered a bunch of other stuff and I would say that they enjoyed it. 1.5/1.5 Star if you want generic dim sum.  If you've been to a Chinese restaurant, you would know that you will get what you ask for as long as you ask for it. We were given everything that was asked for even though they were pushing dim sum carts around. If we wanted something, they would ask the cart pushers to come to us. The service is always fast and accommodating. 1.5/1.5 Stars  We will be back for good ol' fashion dim sum!"}
{"text":"This place is huge, they have a walkie talkie system to flag down empty tables and they wave the customers over.  It was full, but due to their system, we were seated right away.  Surprised at the service here.  I've been to a lot of dim sum restaurants with non existent service.  First time here, so i'm not sure if its usually this good.  But waiters were checking if our tea pots were filled, and plates were cleared constantly.  This is so out of the norm for a dim sum restaurant.  I only had to ask once for stuff.  And it actually came.  In terms of food quality, it wasn't the best, pretty average at best, like other dim sum places in the city. You can pay up to 4.99 for larger dim sum at other restaurants, but they charge 2.70 here for smaller sized dim sum.  Overall, i would attend again, when i bring my kids, they are very impatient when the service and seating is slow.  It was top notched today and a place finally deserving my tips."}
{"text":"It's been a while since I've came here but I swear it used to be better.  The food wasn't bad, but it definitely used to be better. The big disappointment for me was the sticky rice with pork and chicken in the leaves. I don't think it was steamed long enough for the flavour to merge with the rice and there was not enough chicken or pork. Basically a lump of almost sticky rice and slight flavouring.  I think the prices went up from my last visit too. Today it was $2.40 a dish if i remember correctly.   Service was great though, things we asked for came quite fast. At busy dimsum restaurants, simple requests such as an extra spoon or hot sauce can be forgotten a midst all the tasks the servers have to do. So I appreciate that the servers acted upon our requests swiftly."}
{"text":"The food has gone downhill, hasn't it? I realized that some employees didn't work. They need to understand exactly how what they do at work. Avoid talking too much. I don't really like the new manager, she doesn't know the function of food service operation. It' s a waste of my time when I discussed with her about the dinner party."}
{"text":"Mong Kok Chinese Restaurant does not remind me of any long time existing or out of business Chinese Restaurants in Scarborough... since I don't really go to any of them for dim sum... \"older\" Chinese does frequent those while younger people hang out at Starbucks or Destiny...  As note by Wayne C's the GOLD borders, frames , the Chandeliers and the nicely cushioned chairs which will be enticing and comforting  to the older generation..but obviously not doing anything for me.  I cannot comment Mong Kok for their dim sum offerings.. as I was here for a Buddhist Vegetarian dinner.   Prices wise... since special arrangement has been made and as an invited guest, I don't really need to pay for it.. and I have no idea how much it cost.  The menu is pretty standard Vegetarian dishes... nothing usual or creative... but what is usual? what is standard? what is creative?  Most of the dishes I have were mostly DECENT, A-OK but some of them were SO-SO! But now what is SO-SO?   Services here is typical Chinese.. but what is typical Chinese... Does it means good or decent or lousy?  Definitely not my FIRST choice or even second but if my yelp friend wants to come back and show me how the good old days used to be, I will go along for the ride.  And maybe him or his \"worm in the stomach\" (Wayne Worm) can inspire me and I can write much better reviews!"}
{"text":"This is an average Chinese restaurant. Service was good and fast, but sloppy -- seems like they value speed over neatness as the waitor let sauces and soup drip on the table cloth and over the bowls, but he served at lightning speed. The food was good, nothing special or outstanding, just decent. Decor and atmosphere was nofrills."}
