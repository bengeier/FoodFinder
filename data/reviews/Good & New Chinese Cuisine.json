{"text":"Horrible experience at this place today. They messed up our meal, severed our orders to the wrong table twice! We were not eating what we order because they served to wrong table and ate by that table. The plate for steam fish is huge but the fish is a small size fish, they don't have to use a such big plate! LoL.  Also, there is one order of steam item was raw!! Even the waitress said she must bring back to the kitchen, seriously? Steam is the basic cooking skill."}
{"text":"well for a late Tuesday bday dinner it was a change to try something GOOD AND NEW! hell the name speaks for itself.  This place has been opened just over a year, and prior to that it was Milley's donut shop.  

I was surprised to see the choices they had available in the menu, and so we ordered away.  Overall all the dishes are 4/5, i mainly fell in love with the snowpea tips, blackbean tofu with scallops, shredded chicken with greens, and garlic beef.  The flavor was well balanced, and most of all, not too salty.  The prices are very reasonable due to location, and the service is A-OK.....usually these dishes come with a bowl of their house soup, and dessert which was a soup based green bean.  Think of this place like another Magic Walk but less bussier! overall the place was very clean, spacious, hardwooded floors, and alcohol is cheap! $2.50/ beer! whoa...tank it up! lol

However we were a bit discouraged since majority choices for foods were written in Mandarin/Cantonese, however there were english menus.
I will be back, and now I can add this to my list of go-to local places"}
{"text":"Very affordable restaurant offering low to mid-ranged dishes, meaning it is a family restaurant, not a Hong Kong style tea-restaurant (HK cafe), but it is not for banquets.

Rating -
Variety of dishes - 3 stars because there is no higher end choices
Ingredient - 3 stars because not high quality ingredients but the ingredients are fresh
Cooking - 4 stars - despite the focus is on low to mid ranged dishes with lower quality ingredients, the chefs cook the dishes VERY WELL.
Value - 5 stars - very affordable with most dishes below $13 and many offerings at $9.  Seafood is, of course, more expensive."}
{"text":"Good & New Chinese Cuisine is a \"New\" restaurant that is decently good.. especially for the price.

Korean Style Beef ($7.99) 
- Don't taste any Korean sauce or favour is more like beef with garlic and onion
- not bad but should have call that garlic and onion beef

Steamed Zucchini with preserved pork and ginger ($8.99)
- quite interesting flavour... round off with soy sauce
- the ginger taste is quite intense though

There are also fresh lobsters in the tank if you are into lobster.. and some of the standard Cantonese fares with some Northern Spicy dishes.

All meals come with peanuts and soup of the day to start and end with a Chinese dessert..

Open from 4:30 pm to 3:00 am... great if you want to come for midnight snack or have some food after partying!"}
