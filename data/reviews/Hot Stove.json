{"text":"We got my in-laws a gift certificate and reservation for this restaurant and this was what my father-in-law had to say:

\"If the Hot Stove Club offers a sophisticated steakhouse ambience then I am a monkey's uncle. Packed in like sardines (barely a foot between tables) the din (from multiple TV's and the rest of the 'patrons') was overwhelming. Mom and I ate our meal in silence as it was impossible to communicate across the couple of feet of space between us). If it is illegal to have people work amid such noise without proper ear protection how come it is okay to serve people food in such conditions?
When we looked up the dinner menu online we were puzzled to find that none of the choices had a price shown against them. When we perused the menu in the Club we quickly realized why..... Folk would simply be frightened away if they could see the prices online.

The service was, to put it mildly, lousy. To spare your wallets, we skipped the appetizers and ordered an entree apiece (Mom's was salmon: mine Sea Bass). It took a while for the food to show up but when it did it was nicely presented and quite acceptable. However, after our plates were cleared we waited fully 20 minutes in anticipation of seeing a dessert menu. I suspect that because, unlike seemingly all the other tables, we hadn't ordered any bottles of wine we were being given the cold shoulder from the serving staff. By now it was 6.15 p.m. and I was all for leaving but your Mom seemed insistent that she had to have dessert. When it finally arrived, accompanied by a single candle and 'Happy 70th Birthday' writ upon the plate in sauce, I realized why.... I hope the amount billed to your credit card didn't include a tip because they certainly didn't deserve one....\""}

{"text":"Came here for a work-related engagement and had a 12oz sirloin steak with a caesar salad, desserts, and lots of drinks (open bar lol). The food and service was fantastic, but part of it might be because we were such a big party that it was impossible to miss us.

The caesar salad I found to be on the sour side until I bit into the bacon bits that came with it - then it became an unexpectedly good salad. The steak was seasoned very well and the quality of meat undoubtedly top-notch. There was enough flavour without masking the flavour of the meat itself, which is what I was looking for with a steak of this quality. Side mashed potatoes and asparagus were done well too. For dessert, I only had a macaron but it had a light texture and rich flavour.

All the drinks I had came very quickly and were fantastic in both flavour and presentation. The signature cocktail is fruity and light, good for even light drinkers. The red and white wines were both smooth and easy to drink. I liked the white a bit better because it felt lighter and fruitier. None of the drinks I had were bad, I just liked some more than others.

The service was stellar the entire meal. My table's server, Trevor, did a fantastic job hearing and remembering everyone's order, even if they were slid in haphazardly while he was serving us food or other drinks. The timing that the appetizers, food, and dessert came in was perfect. There was enough time to eat, enough time to talk, and enough time to go see the game. It can get pretty messy with big parties but I felt that everything went smoothly. The red/white wines kept coming, the cocktails orders weren't missed, and our server was very attentive to us whether it was to get more bread, desserts, or black pepper.

I definitely enjoyed my experience here, it was probably one of the best meals I've had in my life, but I'd say personally the steak and drinks are worth the price, the salad not so much. I'd like to come back again since it was such good food, but maybe only after applying for a new credit card lol."}
{"text":"Fantastic quality filet mignon, and the mushrooms that you can get as a side were awesome too.  The wine we got was also great, but what's really neat is the way the restaurant integrates with the hockey game: you can request beers to go, and place an order for desserts that will be waiting for you when you come back during one of the breaks!"}
{"text":"Extremely friendly staff. Awesome customer service. Good food, big portion. Pricier than the Keg but cheaper than Jacobs steakhouse. I had the Lobster cobb salad, delmonico rib eye steak, mashed potatoes and onion rings. The onion ring portion is large to share between 3 to 4 people. Lobester cobb salad comes with blue cheese. I personally dont like it and find the taste a little too stronf foe the salad dressing. You can ask them not to include it if you are like me who doesnt like blue cheese. Note: this restaurant is exclusive unless you are VIP or season ticket holder you might not even get a table. If you have tickets for a game you can try to reserve a table for the game night."}
