{"text":"I am also sorry to write this update.  
Zelda's now moved to Yonge St.  No Sunday brunch buffet, very limited brunch menu, no 70s/80s dance music, some top 40s radio station playing.  NOTHING SPECIAL.  Seems they left the things that made Zelda's good on Church Street.  I would have gotten better food at the Golden Griddle on Carlton or even at Fran's.  No reason to make the trip.  Sad eh?"}
{"text":"I like this place! I loved their old location better though! Food is alright and service is great and i like their dragalicious theme!"}
{"text":"What's up Canada!  I love the food here and the entertainment is awesome.  If there is one thing I will remember about Toronto, it's Zelda's.  I was in town for my wedding and wanted to find a place to celebrate before proceeding to honeymoon land.  The day before our wedding, my partner and I went to eat at Zelda's, because LOGO had featured them as a Toronto hot spot.  The food was fabulous and the desserts to die for.  The pirogies were the best I've had.  While conversing with Daniel, our waiter, he offered to reserve us a table for the Friday show and assured us a great time.  Well, we weren't disappointed.  The show was great!  Daniel waited on us again and he was as friendly, attentive, and fun as the day before.  He even bought us crispy crunch shots to celebrate our nuptials.  Everyone was great.  Judge Judy sentenced us (two lesbians) to drink blow jobs on stage (LOL).  Our wedding day would have be special anyway, but the people at Zelda's were like the whip cream on the top of a blow job shot.  You could drink one without it, but the cream makes the drink a happy one.  Thanks to all the staff and patrons, we'll see you again soon to see your make over.  Peace and love."}
{"text":"I'd describe Zelda's as a good regular spot that's not a chain restaurant.
Came here a couple times over pride weekend because the patio is really nice to sit and people watch.
The servers are a mix of cute gay men and buff straight guys. I love the tourists oggling the straight servers and saying, \"if only they weren't gay.\"  haha..little to they know..

anyhow, it's one of the few places where the objectification of men matches the objectification of female servers around the city.

The service:
Reliably good.  All the servers are nice and have a great personality.  Prompt, kind and, of course, cute to boot.

The food:
Reliable and good.  not amazing, again, but solid portions and a regulars menu of tex-mex, burgers and salad.
They only have one thing seserty on the menu, which is unfortunate.  But the chocolate/oreo cake looked good, even though I didnt' try it.

The drinks:
But who cares about the food?  the real draw of this place is to get a pitcher of something and lounge on the patio for hours.  And the servers don't mind the loitering and are very nice- they don't check up on you too often and make you feel bad for loitering but they check up on you enough to get refills or more drinks.  The vibe is perfect.

The washrooms:
I'm ocnfused how I have to go past the narrow service/food pickup bar to get to the washrooms.  It makes it a bit uncomfortable to share the narrow path to the washroom with half-naked male servers who are picking up food orders.  
But after you make the trip back and forth a couple times you learn to just smile graciously at the servers who say sorry for getting in your way and part as you go down the path.

Overall:
4/5 for Service
3/5 Overall.

Positives= service, reliability
Negatives= nothing is oustanding, and it is reliable in a chain-restaurant sort of way (w/out being a chain restaurant)."}
{"text":"Food: 4 stars.  Service: 1 star.

I've been to the new location a few times, and the food is consistently good. During my most recent visit though, our rude waiter really put a damper on the experience.

Me and a friend were there for dinner, and it was by no means busy. I'm pretty sure the instant we ordered coke and water (no alcohol), the waiter's attitude went straight downhill. He was curt, unattentive, and downright rude. Our food arrived, and we never saw him again until he came to collect our plates. He did the bare minimum, and wouldn't even talk to us beyond the absolute basics. As we were paying, there was absolutely no \"thank you\" or \"have a nice night\", even after I'd tipped him close to 30%. By the end of the meal my friend and I were both stunned at how disrespectful he was. Great way to treat the customers who are paying your salary!

I didn't really understand this attitude. This IS zelda's after all, which is known as a friendly/quirky establishment. Given this experience though, I'm really hesitant to visit here again."}
{"text":"I've been to Zelda's a few times for drag-queen bingo, hangover brunches, and quick lunch. The food isn't the greatest; it's your typical greasy-spoon diner fare. Stay away from the battered french fries, but the egg breakfasts are fine. However,  the service has always been super nice. And the check always comes in a glittery high heel. How wonderful is that? AWESOME-LEVEL WONDERFUL, that's how wonderful it is. 

TL;DR: Visit Zelda's. Eat eggs, not fries. Hug a local drag queen."}
{"text":"Touristy on the night I went with some decent drag. I'm betting this place is great on the weekends with better acts and more of a gay crowd. 

Drinks were good. Food smelled good but I went there after dinner.

If you miss old school drag, this is a place to visit."}
{"text":"the food is good 
the waitress there is really nice

but it smelled like someone had been smoking when we came in

you know that awful left over smoke smell when you go to a bar that serves breakfast ?
that kind of smell and that ruins it for me"}
{"text":"Me (sitting at a table with a window view): The entertainment is here.
The One True Chris P: Yes?
Me: Yeah, I just saw some oddly dressed women jumping out of a car.
The One True Chris P: Those aren't women.
Me: Oh. I'm very innocent, you know.

I'd probably give this place a 1 or 2 star review if it weren't for the fact the waiter was a pretty alright guy and deduced my drink preference. The One True Chris P and I kind of wanted to enjoy some mutual one-on-one time under the influence. I asked for a honey nut brown beer and they were sold out. But the waiter noted they have Guinness off menu. Oh? Yes. I'll have two of those.

I had the fish and chips. I didn't find it any better than you could get at the frozen food section in the grocery store. The Zelda fries were dull. The food took an amazingly long time to come. There were about 2 other patrons in the whole establishment.

The bill in the woman's shoe was a nice bit of fun. I resisted falling back into my weird pre-therapy fetish days, filling the shoe with hand cream, and \"enjoying\" it in the men's bathroom. 

This place would probably be a gas for the show but if you're looking for some good eats along Yonge there's nothing really of interest here."}
{"text":"Cute little place on Yonge Street.  I went there with my boyfriend for lunch one day.  When we got the menus it was only for brunch, but we really wanted something off of the lunch menu.  Fortunately for us, the regular lunch menu was also available!  

They have a wide variety of food to choose from, which is always a plus when you're with a bunch of people.  I ordered the mac and cheese with a side salad.  It was a perfect size portion.   The mac and cheese was just how I like it...cheesy!  And the salad was well dressed, so not too saucy.  My boyfriend got the clubhouse with fries.

It was a little loud in there, but there was a big group of people who had clearly gone out the night before.  So I don't want to say it's always noisy.  

The service was a bit slow.  My boyfriend had asked for a side of mayo, and had to go up to the bar and ask for it himself b/c it was never brought to him and no one checked on the table for awhile.  

I'd go back b/c there were other things on the menu I wanted to try, but if the service wasn't good again I probably wouldn't go back a third time."}
{"text":"This is one of those places where you say, an oldie but goodie.

Having been here before, one thing is for certain the entertainment is priceless.  Drag queens and kitsch galore!  Two floors for guests to amuse their gay ( and I mean that in the happy sense) away!

They have drag shows and dirty bingo nights populated by not just community supporters but anyone who just likes to laugh and have a good time.

On the other hand, the food is something I was warned about before I even ordered by others that have tried it before.  They were right.. My meal was not memorable in any way. Burger was overcooked and the the fries greasy but when the stomach is hungry, the meal filled a void. 

However, my server was awesome and the establishment has always been great for accommodating groups - not an easy feat!  

All in all - go for a good time. Give the food a pass but an enjoy a drink or two while having a good time with friends."}
{"text":"I ate here before heading back home to San Francisco.  The food was good, but the service was great.  Attentive, polite, and very sexy.  I wish I got the guy's name, hot was HOT!!!"}
{"text":"Went for a weekend buffet brunch with a group.  I did not find it anything special.  Food was standard breakfast fare, nothing more.  No bread or toast was offered, nor hot cereal.  Bacon was greasy.  I think there are much more interesting places to go."}
{"text":"I went to this place (Young St. location) after a show at the Panasonic Theathre. Oh man, are their burritos goooooood! Specifically, I had the Baked Chicken burrito after a long time of trying to decide (there are a lot of delicious sounding things on the menu so beware). As an added bonus, the service is rreeaaallly nice. 

My whole experience was fantastic."}
{"text":"It just occurred to me that I have NEVER written a review for Zelda's and I've been here more times then I can count....that being said, I was a was more of a regular at the Church Street location then this Yonge Street location.

This place was a landmark and a home away from home for Vivian and I last summer, but then the rent when up and they were forced to move locations.

The new Yonge street home of Zelda's is bigger, allowing for more Zeldaness to come out.  With two floors and two patio's there is always a place to play hide and seek with the amazing staff.

First time Vivian and I ventured to the new location was for breakfast - not the best....the Sunday brunch all you can eat buffet is gone - but a little bug told me it might be making a come back - the portion size was not what it used to be and it was as Jeff K said nothing special.

Last week we made our way over for the Staff Drag Show - a Pride week ritual for many, but we just love the show.  It was on the 2nd floor, where all the show take place and it was AMAZING....super fun as always with great performances.  We both ordered our own personal pitchers and a I had a salad where as Viv had the chicken fingers.  I would have had my standard Burrito - but I'm on a no carb diet right now.

The new location has a show a day it seems, from Dirty Bingo Monday's to Fierce Friday's and Spray Cheese Saturday's.  If you're looking for a fun night in the city - hit up Zelda's.

Shout out to my boy Chris V!  I love you sweetie!!  Zelda's we miss you on Church :("}
{"text":"So, one of my New Year's resolutions is to clear up the backlog of places I've bookmarked. 

It's a shame I never got around to reviewing Zelda;s; a genuinely kitchy diner with decent, inexpensive food and a perfect place to take my more conservative work friends at lunch (apparently, some people just don't get drag queens). I've had the mac and cheese (great, except for the onions, which have NO BUSINESS IN MAC AND CHEESE), and any number of soup/salad/sandwich combos, all reliably fresh. Fish and chips were cirspy and fresh if unexciting. Servers had the \"firendly snark\" vibe odwn pat. 

Sadly, the kitchen burned the place out of existence. It briefly reopened as a \"One Direction\" pop-up shop in time for the lads' tour.

I visited, but since there was nothing to eat, I'm left to review their selection of Bieber-haircut-boy posters and action figures (or would they be dolls?). Let's just say they're no NKOTB."}
{"text":"I can't speak for the old location as I had only ever walked by but I've had two great experiences at Zelda's on Yonge. For the first visit you really can't go wrong with 2 for 1 burgers and cheap pony pitchers, and the second visit, all I'm going to say is dirty bingo.

We had the same server both times and he was great. Really friendly and was prompt at making sure we were well lubricated. The food is pretty good. Better than pub food but not quite as good as a full service restaurant. The prices are reasonable for the most part but there are a couple of items on the menu that seem a little over priced.

The best part of my second visit, other than the bingo, was the chicken wings. The hot sauce was actually hot! Plus the wings were meaty and delicious."}
{"text":"Zelda's - famous for being Toronto's only drag restaurant/ bar and home to the ultimate in competition - Toronto's drag contest.

A fairly eclectic menu means everyone will be taken care of - I like their pad thai, and the classics like burgers will treat you well. Especially good are the drinks - lots of different cocktails and options to sip on whilst watching cute waiters run around and drag queens perform on stage.

Smack in the middle of the village, Zelda's is always popular and has a great patio for watching the world go by."}
