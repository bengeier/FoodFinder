{"text":"This place is great! Tons of awesome cats walking around and just hanging out with people. An hour flys by so you might want to think about two. All the cats are running around and just laying on people's laps, or just lounging. Cheap coffee to boot! Definitely worth a trip, especially if you are looking to adopt."}
{"text":"This place is so cute. All of the cats are up for adoption and they have multiple events throughout the week like cat yoga, painting classes and live music. Such a breath of fresh air seeing places like this pop up in Charlotte. Everyone who works here is super friendly and clearly huge animal lovers. They do their best to keep it a calm environment, so they don't stress out the cats, and only allow a certain amount of people in with them at a time which is great. I ordered their chamomile tea, which was delicious, and they're in the process of getting their liquor license which will definitely be a plus! If you haven't been yet, you should go and help support this up and coming business. I love this place"}
{"text":"Wow this place is awesome. So relaxing and such an amazing cause! The staff were helpful, knowledge and kind. The cats were all beautiful and playful and you can tell they were all loving all the warmth and love. Really excited for all these cats to find there forever home! We're definitely becoming members so we can contribute our time and money to a great cause!"}
{"text":"Even if you don't like cats you can still stop in for some coffee or a quiet place to study or meet with someone. The cat room is closed off separately, you can reserve an hour for $12 a person with all the friendly kitties or you can walk-in. You also must sign a waiver before entering the cat room. This can be done online while reserving a time slot. On different days they offer music and yoga. It is a nice environment to get some one on one time with the cats to see if they will be a fit your family :) each cat is adoptable!"}
{"text":"Exceptional service, highly personable, zen atmosphere. I know you're reading this because you haven't gone yet, don't dwadle on it for months like I did! Just book the reservation already! Will definitely be returning, it was a delight to spend time with these beauties"}
{"text":"This place caters towards those who have an appreciation for cats to those that absolutely love them.  What an amazing concept!! It is located upstairs (on the back side of the building) and consists of a small cafe offering various drinks and the \"cat room.\"  I highly suggest making a reservation for the cat room as well as filling out the waivers before your arrival- this will ensure that you are guaranteed a spot and are granted immediate entrance into the cat room at your allotted time.  An hour slot is $12 and helps to support the rescue foundation, Catering for Cats and Dogs.  Some of the cats are interested in play while others prefer to be held or to lay in your lap and be loved on.  Even though I consider myself a \"dog person,\" I was very tempted to leave with one (or actually three) of the adorable kitties!!"}
{"text":"My first time at Mac Tabby was great and unexpected! I signed up for an evening shift  on a week day. Finding the place was a bit hard- use the parking lot off of parkwood and it'll be much easier. Check in is easy. You'll tell them your name and be able to buy a drink or cat themed trinkets (which are all super cute)They limit the number of people in the cat room for each slot which I enjoyed so there's a good person to cat ratio. Everyone can easily have time with each cat. 

Inside Both the cafe and cat room it's very clean and very hip. The cafe has some seating as you wait for your time slot.

The cat room has all kinds of seating options that double as cat sleep spots as well. There's plenty of toys for the cats and plenty of places for them to climb and nap. There's a person who works there inside the room at all times to answer any questions you have. She told us their names and personalities and so forth. I felt like it was the most wonderful place for a cat to live.

I was expecting to read a book during my time slot and have a cat in my lap. This was not the case, which is not to say it was a bad thing but different than what I had expected. Most people being a friend or four to socialize with while they play with the cats or hold them. It's not what you would think of as the quiet, indie music playing cafe but instead a social environment to hang out with cats.

I absolutely loved that every cat is adoptable and that they seem to love their environment. Will be back."}
{"text":"We had a great time! The staff were so friendly and obviously love the being there. It's nice to see a business trying to make lives better for animals while providing a nice break from the day for those who visit."}
{"text":"Ok I've been eagerly awaiting their opening and went with my bff this past weekend.  I backed them via kickstarter as I'm an official crazy cat lady.  I love love love what they are doing for the kitties and it's awesome.  It's $12 for an hour per person.  I can only comment on the cat room as let's face it, I'm here for the cats; not for the coffee or other trinkets.  The place is amazing and very well thought out and appointed.  The cats are clearly loved on and well taken care of.  

Here's the rub - I actually found myself not enjoying it as much as I thought I would.  I'm glad I went, but my issue is with the other patrons.  Well let's face it people can be dicks and I felt like the cats were 'stressed' and being forced to dance monkey dance for some of the jerky patrons.  For instance one of the cutest tuxedo cats in the world (besides my beloved Cole - may he rest in peace) was moseying over to grab a bite of kibble.  One of the patrons came into the clearly \"for staff and cats only\" and picked him up to snuggle with him AS HE WAS EATING! Like seriously how would you feel if someone came and interrupted your mealtime?  Little things like that just made the experience not so great for me and my guest.  There was also a large group that was monopolizing the younger cats - again it's the patrons that made this a meh experience, not the venue.  I'm conflicted in writing this review - but I just had an issue with how some of the patrons were forcing the cats to be held etc etc. 

I think this is a great place to go if you are actively looking to adopt, but on a regular Saturday well I could stay home and play with my cat who actually likes me and isn't stressed out dealing with assholes all day.  I am glad I went and glad my $$ went to support such a great cause."}
{"text":"Love this place! The people are super friendly and the cats are so adorable. I wanted to take them all home!! The coffee was really yummy as well. Can't wait to come back here."}
{"text":"Charlotte has a cat cafe! I have seen a cat cafe in Charleston and hear Raleigh is getting one and the concept is still new to me. We were in town visiting friends and they said Mac Tabby is a new addition to NoDa and just opened in December. I went on the website, read about it and decided to try to book a slot. Everything was full on a Saturday so I tried to waitlist us. We went to Mac Tabby and found the the entrance. It is on the second floor and there is an art gallery on the same floor and the room with all the cats. You then enter the cafe where a friendly lady welcomed us and explained the cat cafe rules. I knew we did not have a chance because waitlist means someone has to cancel and they were booked with 15 guests on the hour every hour. Instead, we had a cup of of coffee, looked at some cat magazines and looked at the photos of the 27 adoptions that have taken place in just a month. The cause is great and cats from a local shelter are brought to Mac Tabby,  you book a time and sign a waiver and then get time with the cats. It is all about an experience and therapy and spending time with cats. The goal is to find home for all of these free range kitties and they seem to be setting a great record so far with all the adoptions. 
We saw guests come in without appointments and they were turned away. I suggest making an appointment ahead of time so that you truly get the time with the cats. They also offer storytime with the cats and children and I think also  yoga with the cats. I love the cause and concept and am glad I got to see a cat cafe in action. It was a purr-fect experience and I can't wait for Raleigh to get one."}
{"text":"Being a crazy cat lady, this was one of the coolest things I've ever done. The staff was beyond friendly and all the kitties were sweet. I would recommend better signage to find the place as gps doesn't get you there, and being a non-local it was hard to find."}
{"text":"This is the coolest new place is Charlotte if you love cats like I do. Lori, the owner, has been fostering cats for years and wanted to find a way to help the Charlotte community and the Charlotte kitty community connect. She works with Catering to Cats and Dogs, a local rescue organization, to bring the most adoptable cats to her cafe. (We got one of our cats from Catering to Cats and Dogs and had a great experience throughout the whole process!) 

You have to make a reservation in advance to book an hour time slot so that the kitties don't get overwhelmed and so that there are enough cats to go around. An hour in the cafe will cost you about $12 per person, but they also offer special events such a yoga which may vary. Items like Pure Intentions coffee and Lenny Boy kombucha are also available for sale in the cafe room (vs the kitty room) and coffee was only $2. 

Inside the cat room, there are all sort of seating options but I mostly sat on the floor with the cats lol. But seriously, lots of comfy options and plenty of cat toys and books and crannies for the cats to take a nap after all of the playtime they are getting. 

This place is so good for the cats and so good for Charlotte.  Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"what a perfect place. i am so happy to have a cat café in a place i call home. it's such a welcoming, chill vibe and you can't go wrong being surrounded by cats (and coffee)!!"}
{"text":"Nice thing they are doing.  The staff is super nice.  Probably won't be back though.
1) I'd prefer they rotate the cats in and out between groups or days or have more cats.  There were 12 cats total and most of them (6 to 8) were too tired or not interested in interacting with people.
2) Which brings me to the other patrons.  When you are interacting with a cat, another patron will come over and step in front of you to take a picture of that cat or pick the cat up and take the cat to the other side of the room.  There's no respect by other patrons.  So if you have 4 to 6 available cats and 15 people who want to interact with them...well the \"wonderful\" behavior comes out from those other patrons and it's not, for me anyway, a relaxing or fun experience."}
{"text":"I really wish they had a wine bar and Happy Meowour like the cat cafe in Charleston. The Charleston cafe has a more comfortable hang out vibe. I love the concept and glad there is one finally in Charlotte!"}
{"text":"This cafe is definitely focused around the cats. It's $12 an hour to hang out with the kitties, and you can bring any of the drinks or snacks you buy at the cafe into the kitty room. The hot chocolate is just Swiss Miss, but for only a $1, I can't complain. The hot tea is Biglow. There are cookies and granola bars for snacks. As for the kitty room, there is plenty of seating, and the hour flies buy! The cats are so friendly, and my group had fun petting and playing with them. It's obvious that they are well cared for, as the room is very clean and well designed with plenty of interesting spaces for the cats (shelves, beds, scratching posts, etc). If you're a cat lover, this place is definitely for you! If you fall in love with one of them, you can even adopt him or her, and the place has already had many of the cats adopted in the short time they have been open. So, you're also supporting a good mission."}
{"text":"Mac Tabby is really something special. You can take your dogs to parks or breweries, or even dog bars, but at the end of the day, you don't go to these places to play with other people's animals. Mac Tabby is strictly dedicated to playing and hanging out with \"free range\" adoptable cats from Charlotte's own Catering to Cats and Dogs.
Here's how it works: 
Reserve your spot online and come on in. Sun a waiver when you arrive, grab any snacks or drinks you want, and enter through the door. Spend your hour hanging with cats. All of them have different personalities, but they're all sweet and used to people. Tons of toys around and lots of chairs and places to sit. There's calm music in the background, and the whole idea is to just chill. If you fall in love while you're there, the adoption fee is $125 and you'll be helping to home a wonderful animal. 
Lori, the owner, has poured her heart into this place - it's clean, smell free, and supports all local businesses like Pure Intentions, Lenny Boy, and local artists. 
Overall, Mac Tabby is a wonderful addition to Charlotte and it's pretty cool that we finally have a place like this. You better believe we'll be back soon.

Oh, and if you're not a fan of cats... Try this place. I'll bet you'll change your mind."}
