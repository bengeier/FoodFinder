{"text":"First visit. I ordered the cod and shrimp basket with fries. It came with two pieces of cod and three shrimp. Just over nine dollars without a drink. Food was made fresh, about a ten minute wait. Fish was moist and flaky, batter was perfect, crispy, little bite of black pepper, and not too oily. Only thing missing was a cold, English ale. Worth stopping in."}
{"text":"Grew up here and this is the best catfish ever. The shrimp tasted fresh and the breading was perfect, too.  I tried the regular not spicy, but it was perfect.  Shared with three people so we tried most of the sides and they were all delicious.  The dessert was great too!  Lived here for 60 years and did not know about this place until Yelp."}
{"text":"First of all I want to counter comment the review from Brittney S. 
You went to this place 3 times as you stated and I would hope knew it was a Soul Food place... Therefore alot of fried food. They don't offer smothered there either. If you don't like it, don't go... They didn't force you to order fattening item's feel your review was not accurate. 

Anyway, we went on Saturday Oct 8th. Being a girl from the South I am always on the look out for good Southern/Soul food places everywhere. There are not too many in the Phoenix area. \"Mo\" took our order and recommended some items for me. He was nice and very helpful. We also met the owner \"Papa Joe\" who was very nice and very appreciative of our patronage. I ordered the pulled brisket sandwich, mac and cheese, greens, corn bread and sweet potato pie. The sandwich reminded me of Texas style BBQ. The mac and cheese was creamy and delicious. The greens were seasoned and delicious as well. The corn bread and desert was also equally pleasing. 
My boyfriend ordered the ribs, fried okra, jalapeno hush puppies. The sauce on the ribs was tasty and have black pepper in the sauce, the ribs fell apart they were so tender. The okra was not too breaded and was cooked perfect. The hush puppies were great and not spicy hot like one might think. Over all we will go back, it was great food and the staff were nice to us. I do recommend checking this place out if you want a little soul in your hole....."}
{"text":"The catfish was delicious. Perfectly seasoned, crispy and a very thin batter. If your going to eat fried food (and you normally don't) this is the place to have it. Pulled pork, jalape√±o hushpuppies, baked beans, fried shrimp and cornbread was all devoured by my family. However, don't be in a rush. It took an hour to get our food. Very busy place."}
{"text":"Absolutely love papa joes! The owners are soo nice. Great customer service. The food is to die for! Whenever I want bbq, I come pay papa joes a visit!!"}
{"text":"Definitely a stop here whenever I'm West Valley.  Good Customer service and really nice staff.  Catfish nuggets and greens are my favorite."}
{"text":"I cannot come out and say this any clearer or directly than I am about to: I love this place, and the man (Papa Joe) and his family who own and operate it. I have been frequenting Papa Joe's for over a year now and since moving to Phoenix in 2012. In that time, I have never had a bad meal, either quality or service wise...and only awesome experiences talking with Papa Joe, his lovely wife, and all of the customers who, like me, value awesome soul food and atmosphere alike. I am always assured of a smiling face, and someone (in Papa Joe) who values and appreciates me for more than just being a paying customer. Also, and this speaks more to Papa Joe as a person than a business owner/operator, this is the only place around where one can count on a heapin' helpin' of spiritual wisdom and comfort on top of their fish and chips or ribs. 

My staple meal is the 2 or 3 piece cod with french fries and cole slaw. Of course, the meal also comes with a drink and butterflied fried shrimp too. The portions are hearty and filling, and the food is always fresh and tasty. The oil they use to fry in is changed regularly, and results in fish and chips that are light and clean, and the fries especially are always fried to perfection. They also have a non-carbonated drink station now, including lemonade, grape and fruit punch drinks, which reminds me of the South and the original soul food movement in so many ways that my mouth waters and heart aches that I am not writing this from there with a cold drink in my hand! My favorite is taking the lemonade and grape drink in the cup together, and the entire meal compliments itself and my palate so wonderfully. 

I have also had the ribs, and other menu items, and love them all, but return for the fish and chips almost weekly or at least when my wallet can afford it. But more than anything else, I return to support Papa Joe, his family and business--because they all treat me and make me feel like one of their own time and again, without reserve or fail. 

I am not going to slight or judge any Yelpers who have left negative reviews of either the atmosphere or quality of food Papa Joe's serves... to each their own and everyone is entitled to their opinions, just as am I. However and as someone who has lived in and traveled to so many different states and countries outside of America even, and has sampled the cuisine in so many locales that I cannot even count--I believe Papa Joe's Fish and Que to be a cut above the rest when one is seeking the physical and spiritual comfort and satiation of a true soul food experience in the heart of the Valley of the Sun. 

My hope is that you will try them and feel the same... and become a member of the family with your first and every visit thereafter:-)."}
{"text":"Came back again because I enjoyed it so much last time. I got the spicy catfish again because its so good but so many other things I want to try. I did try the sweet potato pie this time and loved it. Never had it before but love it more than pumpkin pie now. Can't beat the price of this place. Will be back hope I can pry myself into trying something else but not sure love that catfish and I'm not even a person who eats fish much."}
{"text":"My family and I were driving to a restaurant located near Papa Joe's but it happened to be closed. We had no idea where we were going but saw Papa Joe's in passing and decided to give it a try. This was the best thing we could have done. Absolutely great customer service. They are just down to earth folks and their food was delicious. My wife had spicy cod, my children had the hamburger and french fries and I had the spicy catfish. Everyone was delighted. Great night out. They have earned a new customer and probably several others since I've already advertised it to my family and friends. Way to go Papa Joe!"}
{"text":"Hubby and I stopped for a late lunch at Papa Joe's.  We both ordered the two piece catfish with three fried shrimp.  He got spicy, I did not.  He got fries, I got Mac n cheese.  The food was SO good and there was plenty of it.  The catfish was perfectly cooked, not too greasy, and seasoned to perfection.  All for under $20 ( which included drinks).

The service is very friendly and the place is clean.  We will DEFINITELY be back!!"}
{"text":"WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE I EVER EXPERIENCED! !  Owner argues with his customers embarrass them if your order isn't right.He had the nerve to argue with my wife infront of my daughter Because she cant eat ketchup it was mistakenly put on her burger. He Refuse for 10 mins not to change the burger or bun because it was our fault the order was wrong."}
{"text":"The cod was excellent! It was perfectly prepared. At Papa Joe's the customers feel nurtured and cared for. The great combination of food skills and people skills shows why Papa Joe's has been a success for so long."}
{"text":"Spicy Catfish was good. I tried the fried okra and although it wasn't bad I won't be going for that side again. Just not my thing. Staff was a bit distant but that may be due to just finishing the lunch rush. It's hard to find good catfish in Phoenix so I will be giving Papa Joe's another shot."}
{"text":"I Love this Whitting Fish Sandwhich. I order it with Fries and Cole Slaw. Personally I dump Cole Slaw on the Fish Sandwhich and I'm great!"}
{"text":"Stopped here by chance. The catfish was excellent. The breading was light,the fish tasted great without tartar sauce. The sides were also excellent. Not the fanciest place but clean and neat."}
{"text":"I go to papa Joe's at least two times a week, I usually get the pulled brisket sandwich combo, with. onion rings, and mac and cheese. The sandwich is Delicious the brisket is really tender and flavorful nice BBQ sauce on it to. The onion rings are nice and golden brown the mac n cheese tastes awesome as well.

This is a Family owned restaurant, everyone is friendly and courteous and you get treated like a valued customer. They also sell Catfish which I hear is the bomb allot of folks get it if you like some tasty deep friend catfish try some at papa Joe's.

If your looking for some good BBQ in a warm and friendly environment you should definitely try papa Joe's."}
{"text":"Pretty good place..alwyas clean and orderly. Always met with a smile and with courtesy. The first time i had the hot link sandwich, which was good but the sauce was more of a wing sauce that what i like on my hot link sandwiches. The second time i got the whole wing special, which was good, but i forgot to ask them to dip them in wing sauce."}
{"text":"Love  the  Fish...  its all i eat when i stop by... gotta  see bout the ribs and other menu  items...   I appreciate that its African American  owned..  has its own niche location  beside the bowling  alley  area  across the street  from the  hospital  on Bethany Home ."}
{"text":"Delicious fish, fried okra is perfect.  Very friendly and fast service."}
{"text":"First time ever been here and it was a great expeirence. When we first walked in we were greeted with a friendly hello and an explanation of the menu. The decor is professional with a hint of a home-y feel to it and it definitely looks like they take care of the place. The wait was pretty short - maybe a maximum of 15 minutes- but the food was piping hot when we got it. All of it was great and we'll definitely be coming back! :)"}
{"text":"If your looking for some good tasting fried catfish come to this place. I had the catfish and shrimp basket.  The portion size of the catfish was big sized.  I also had the peach cobbler to go, it was tasty. I'm most definitely going back and trying other things."}
{"text":"Spicy Catfish. Amazeballs. Brisket, perfectly Smokey. Greens and Okra. Wow. I am in love!!"}
{"text":"After all the good reviews I read for Papa Joe's, I was really looking forward to some fried catfish and fried okra. I was disappointed. The fish was rubbery, as was the fried okra.  The peach cobbler was in a little container and was cold. I won't be back again."}
{"text":"I really didn't see anything special about this place. We had fried catfish and whiting and fried shrimp that basically tasted like something out of the freezer. Nothing very special or great, maybe a little too greasy even. The fries were bland and the fried okra was okay (nothing compared to what I had in Georgia). Not horrible, just won't be going back again because it wasn't very good."}
{"text":"I love this place. Ordered 2 cod plus extra tarter sauce. Ended up with one unused sauce - bought more fish!"}
{"text":"1st time here and everything excellent! Had the spicy catfish, shrimp & fried okra. Batter was light and not too greasy at all. 

Catfish was easily the best I've ever had and the okra had a light spice, real subtle flavour and so delicious!

People working were real friendly and helpful, & cook served up my order with a genuine smile. 

Definitely going back!"}
{"text":"CATFISH!

After being prompted by a friend to check this place out for months and being in the area, I decided to give it a shot. Although I've enjoyed catfish before, I've never really thought of seeking out a place for it, nor is it something I would usually order. What a fool I've been. 

Figured it would an unidentifiable white fish with an overbearing batter to cover up the low quality product... fortunately, I was wrong.  I ordered the 2 piece spicy catfish which comes w a few shrimp and fries. 

It took about 10 minutes to get my food which was a good sign since it was obviously going to be fresh. The portion was huge and looked great when I picked it up. 

2 really big fish filets w a golden brown crust. When I bit into a piece it was piping hot and the flavor of the fish jumped out. It was really good. The spicy crunch on the outside was awesome and just the right amount. Not too much breading but enough to crisp it up. 

Fries were cold as they had been waiting for the fish (thus only 4 stars) and the butterflied fried shrimp with it were great too. 

It's a dive for sure and a bit seedy inside (these 2 me are positive traits) and will be back for sure. 

There was another guy there who said he has been eating at Papa Joe's every Friday for a year....I asked what else he has had and he looked at me like I was crazy. Said, \"I've had the catfish and there is no reason to eat anything else ever\" 

I can't say that I disagree with him. Go and don't be sneaky...order the catfish and enjoy."}
{"text":"let me preface this by saying that it is rare to find a restaurant in phoenix that has character and personality.  you go in and ask an employee what they like and what you should order to get a good idea of this place..they stare blankly or respond 'i dont know everything is good.'  Being from dallas i was so used to restaurants that have people with a genuine love for what they do and the business they represent.

Which leads me to Papa Joe's.  This place was amazing.  I asked the gentleman at the front counter and told him it was my first time there and what he suggested that I order. 

\"one piece fish three shrimp, pork rib, hot link. fries.'

so thats what i got.  had a good conversation with the man who was from texas as well football and whatnot.  good texas homecooking.  heh.  i ordered to go  but enjoyed my ten minutes of waiting for the food talking to the staff and even talking to the man's wife whom he introduced me to.  he said i would enjoy the good homecooking being from texas and all.  this food blew my mind.

atmosphere was great.  staff was incredible.  food was to die for.  go.  seriously. price was ridiculously cheap.  paid around 9.00 or so for all of that food and a drink.  cheaper than anywhere else in town.

the ONLY negative is that i couldn't stop myself from eating until i was sickeningly full.

seriously.  it's that good."}
{"text":"Being from the SF Bay Area I know great Seafood when I have it. This place is up there. I have been enjoying the Catfish for some years now. It is the best I have found in Phoenix. I have tried to find places that remind me of the Great food in the (Oakland) Bay Area. Being here in wonderful Phoenix (Being Land Locked) Fresh Fish is a challenge to say the least.
I can be sure when I leave Papa Joe's I am full and Happy. The Owner and his wife make you feel like family.  You can't get better than that.
At least the part of the family they still like......"}
{"text":"Papa Joe's is an excellent restaurant if you're looking for delicious fried fish.  If you're interested in ambiance, service, or frills, you should stay away.

The catfish sandwich is a great deal ($3.89).  The fish was well breaded and crispy (not soggy or oily).  The absolutely best thing on the menu is the fried Okra.  Even if you don't generally like okra, you should give it a try.  The breading they use is spicy and fantastic!

I think they close at 7 PM, so don't try to come for dinner!"}
{"text":"All the reviews you read and see are pretty much spot on. I've been doing a tour of local fried fish spots here in town and there was no point in trying anywhere else when I ate at Papa Joe's. The fish is perfectly cooked and seasoned. The prices are great. The sides are incredible (especially the fried okra). I've only had the bbq pulled pork sandwhich but the bbq is very solid as well. Go to Joe's, the best fried fish spot in Phx."}
{"text":"A few people had been telling me about this place for a while and had been wanting to try it. Happened to be in the area with my family and had to see what it do. 

Ordered the 2 piece catfish with shrimp for my wife, 3 piece ribs for myself and a 2 piece ribs for my kids. The catfish was perfectly seasoned. I'm normally skeptical about ordering ribs anywhere I go due to the lack of meat on the bones. Wasn't disappointed there. And they were cooked to perfection. Very juicy and the meat came off the bone with ease. Portions weren't bad as well. I could've eaten more but I'm a big dude at 6'9\". 

The sides we chose were cornbread, greens, potato salad and Mac n cheese. I went on a limb and tried the greens n Mac n cheese because I heard they were good but...I like mine better lol. 

Definitely a place I'll revisit again but for different sides.

Enjoy!!"}
{"text":"I'm visiting from California. And i am one of the hardest catfish critics. Not gone lie. PapaJoe's catfish is on POINT . And you have to taste the cookies. Me and my wife will be coming back soon. They made us feel like home."}
{"text":"This place knows how to fry some grub. I have been to Papa Joe's a few times now and I keep going back for the spicy catfish. I love the light breading. The fries, okra and greens are pretty great too. This place is a little bit ghetto, but service is always good. Papa Joe is a cool guy. This place is definitely on my return list."}
{"text":"Joes has the best fried fish in Phoenix. Good prices,i feel that i get a large amount of food for what i pay, other places charge an arm and a leg for what joes gives you. Go with the catfish,its what they do best. Hushpuppies are amazing as well."}
{"text":"Just letting folks know how awkward it was for the owner \"Joe\" to try and explain how he was not going to let me and my kids buy a friend of our family a dinner which he was in much need for from his restaurant, his explanation was he scares my customers because of is attire and begs from the customers!  Just lets you know how \"Old Willy lynch\" is still holding people from getting into a better predicament or at least a meal from someone who was willing to pay! At the same time he lost a valuable customer (s) .Next time if someone is cramping your style Big Joe call the police instead of assuming people will look down on you because you serve someone of a lower class."}
{"text":"A classic southern style mom and pop joint.Decor and dining is far from special but the food and customer service is excellent.The owner is friendly and \"grandad\" like.My favorite is the fried whiting which is extremely hard to find in the western part of the country.Sides are good and ribs and chicken are good but probably not the traditional \"slow and low wood smoke\" that would put this restaurant over the top.That being said whenever I'm in this part of town I try to stop in!"}
{"text":"Consistently delicious, no matter what you order. Very friendly and laid back atmosphere. Orders take a bit, but everything is cooked and fried to perfection. Come at least once a week. Never disappointed"}
{"text":"I tried this place for the first time and it's pretty good. Spicy cod and the fried okra was amazing.  The only down fall is the tartar sauce isn't homemade! I didn't like that it came out of a packet. Overall I will go back."}
{"text":"Always drove past this place but never stopped by.  My brother and I had a fish and chip craving and used Google Maps to search for a fish and chip place nearby.  After looking at the reviews and photos I just had to give it a try.  I am glad we did.  Best fish and chips I have ever had in Phoenix in a long time.  There's been a few places in the past that were good but sea food places are not very big here.  Too many taco, pizza and sub shops.  I will be coming back to try other menu items. We had the 3-piece regular cod, four-piece shrimp and large fries.  Also, a side of mac and cheese which was good.  It comes with regular size drink.  Bill total was $40.10.  $14.48(fish, shrimp and fries) +1.99(extra fries) +1.99(mac and cheese) =$18.46 x 2=$36.92+$3.18 tax=$40.10."}
{"text":"I never  write reviews.. but I couldn't  help myself. This is definitely in my top 3 places to get a good fried fish meal...i had the catfish  and french fries..just to keep it safe. It was so damn delicious.. tomorrow ill be back for greens, catfish, and dessert. ..maybe a hotlink or two. i recommend 10 times over."}
{"text":"Our first visit won't be our last!  This place is GOOD!  Had catfish & white fish. which were excellent!  Definitely will return to try more! The Okra and coleslaw were equally as good! This place seemed to have lots of regular customers, which says a lot about a place.  :-)   We'll be regulars soon and we're bringing mom with us!"}
{"text":"I had beef ribs( They weren't tender and had plenty of fat. Also the barbecue sauce was watery and just not good) greens (They were ok not much flavor and a bit too much vinegar for me) The corn bread fell apart after taking one piece. It was very dry didn't taste like it was mixed well before cooking it. So of course it was nasty. Now the fried okra was good, a little spicy with plenty of flavor."}
{"text":"This was our first time eating here and let me say we were more than happy with their food.  The seasoning was on point, chicken wings and catfish we ordered were cooked to perfection.  This is definitely our go to spot for now on for down home cooking."}
{"text":"This is my sides place.  You know the place you stop by on the way home and get some ready-mades to go with whatever is in the crockpot or with left over meat from the day before.  That said, I love, love, love the peach cobbler!  30 seconds in the microwave at home and yum.  I often order the greens and the fried okra or the hush puppies.  The okra has a spicy breading and the hush puppies have a peppery kick that satisfies.  I have tried other items on the menu and didn't like what I got.  The fish, cod, was not cook thoroughly and the hamburger was meh.  I did try the pulled beef sandwich and found it dry and the sauce was not tasty in the least.  So I stick to what I like.  I don't eat pork or catfish so this review is not for those who do."}
{"text":"I go to this place just for the collard greens been coming back 1+ year. They just added sweet potato tater tots and theyre bomb. The fish is seasoned perfectly everytime they never disappoint"}
{"text":"Really don't want to rant and rave about how good it is, kinda don't want to share. But it's the right thing to do. hands down best damn food you can buy. Made with love, no doubt about it. Man hit the spot. Spice catfish wish a side of mac n cheese so freaking good! Thank you papa Joe!  I'll be back real soon."}
{"text":"Catfish was very good. Ribs were very bad (had veins and fat throughout)."}
{"text":"Talk about a hole in the wall. Great fried catfish! The mac and cheese was a little light on the flavor side and the sweet potato tots were pretty good. Booths are super uncomfortable to sit in so make sure you grab a regular table."}
{"text":"Our first visit was tonite. We both had the cod with onion rings, the wife had potato salad while I had the cole slaw. All of it was pretty good. The menu is on the wall. You order and pick up your own food at the counter"}
{"text":"A little pricey, but it was good. I took a star away because the fish was a little overcooked. It got rid of my fried fish hankering. Free drink refills and HUSHPUPPIES! All in all I recommend trying this place. I will go back again."}
{"text":"Great place for quality food and caring family service. Wait takes a little long but definitely worth it. I recommend calling your order in before hand"}
{"text":"Located in an old Quiznos, this is great food for a great value! Very low prices, everything was fried and delicious. Try the spicy catfish in strips or nuggets with sides of sweet potato tots, fried okra and jalape√±o hush puppies. We waited 20 minutes for our food, but it was worth the wait. The lemonade is delicious! The decor leaves much to be desired."}
{"text":"My first time here... looks like a real \"dive\" Smells of fried fish! Packed for lunch with locals. Ordered pulled Pork Sandwich with 2 sides (Fried Okra & Jalapeno Hushpuppies) & drink of your choice... Total $6.97! The Cashier calls out your number... there are no waiters etc.  the food was delicious!"}
{"text":"Great catfish! Their spicy catfish is more peppery than spicy, but the fish was moist and the breAding was crispy and not at all oily. The shrimp was fantastic too. I wanted more hotness overall so I spiked my coleslaw with hot sauce and lemon. It was tasty ;) overall would return to try their other fried fish and the okra."}
{"text":"This place to me is just \"Eh\", not the best BBQ in town by any stretch of the imagination. And when we went they didn't have Mac n Cheese, which is the thing I was most looking forward to."}
{"text":"My husband and I just had their cod fish and chips with shrimp and it was easily the best we've ever had. The owners were very friendly and still served us even though it was after 7:30 pm and they close at 8. We will make the 45 minute drive every time we want fish and chips for as long as we live in AZ."}
{"text":"Omg this is the best spicy catfish nuggets,Mac & cheese and fried okra ever. I will definitely go back and let friends know about papa joes. Prices are not out of line with the amount of food you get. Excellent"}
{"text":"Today was my first time there. I ordered the fried catfish and shrimp and loved it. Can't wait to go back tomorrow to try the fried chicken!!!"}
{"text":"Southern fried fish is hard to find outside of the south!  I found it HERE!  Crunchy outside, moist inside!  And it tastes like fish!  Not the fish that's been frozen so long it's tasteless!  Always a delight to stop in! I love the whiting and fried okra!  The buffalo wings...eh, Mac & cheese is just ok. I LUV fried okra, so I get double okra as my side. Drinks are included with meal!  Cool, casual place!"}
{"text":"First time,early lunch time, nice crowd coming in..I can not say enough about the food, when I tasted the cat fish, I turned around at our table and asked Janet, 'If I got up n' danced would she call the police'. The BEST EVER !!  Go, discover the best Southern style cookin' this side of New Orleans :D:D

{"text":"Greens, hush puppies, okra, cod , shrimp, and a pulled chicken sandwich on point. This place is everythang. First of many more visits."}
{"text":"Just tried this for the first time, really tasty fried shrimp.  I would definitely eat here again.  This is one of the mom and pop shops that's a rare find."}
{"text":"Not a bad place for some fish when you need a fix. For those that complain about the decor, this is a fish shack, if you want to pay double to eat in a better decorated and more modern establishment then by all mean venture onto Centeral. If you want good fish at a good price then this is your place.

I had the 1pc Cod (Spicy)/2Shrimp w/ Mac & Cheese Im not sure if the batter was the spicy part of the sauce, but the batter was not spicy to me. However, all the fish was battered nicely (not full of grease) and the tarter and cocktail sauce was very good and had a bit of a kick. To cure my spice crave I got some hot sauce by the pop machine and that did the trick. The Mac & Cheese was a bit bland, but everything was piping hot!

All the staff was fantastically friendly and very helpful.

Its not a bad place if you need a F&C fix."}
{"text":"Beat fried okra ever and their catfish is amazing!!  The greens were a little bit bland and the Mac N' Cheese was just good,  not great...their ribs are pricey...but big and tender.  It is our new go to spot for excellent catfish and ribs."}
{"text":"My boyfriend & I are both fans of BBQ. He is especially picky but I can understand because his Dad makes the best BBQ and homemade sauce I have ever had. That being said, Papa Joe's is delicious. We have never had a bad experience and have been coming here for a while. The pulled pork or pulled chicken are my personal favorites. If you go later in the day there is a good chance the pulled pork will be gone, that's a good sign in my book. He normally gets the ribs & has never complained. Their fried okra is good as well the batter has the perfect spices in it.
 I have suggested Papa Joe's to several friends; its small & the people are friendly!"}
{"text":"OMG! What a find. Southern Fried Fish and BBQ just the way I like it. Been meaning to stop by and try this place for almost a year and now I'm kicking myself for not stopping sooner. The catfish was fried and seasoned perfectly in cornmeal. Okra and onion rings were perfect. The only place I can get fish like this at Hush Puppies in Vegas or in LA."}
{"text":"This place is amazing!  I decided to try it one day because it is right by my work, and I have been hooked ever since!  Some of the best soul food around this side of town!

Personal favs: spicy catfish (which by the way you can now get in nugget style!), mac-n-cheese, and their beans (which are a combo between ranch style beans and sweet beans; I can't even begin to describe the mouth watering flavor).

I always ask for my catfish extra spicy because their regular spicy batter doesn't cut it for me; they never object!  Food is consistently ranked for HIGH QUALITY."}
{"text":"Best catfish in Arizona. Big portions and very fresh. I definitely recommend eating here you will keep coming back."}
{"text":"They put the sole in soul food!
Walk in and ask
\"What should I order?\" 
It's one of those places where if you follow directions you just can't go wrong. Undeniably damn good food! Had the hot fish with butterfly shrimp and a side of potato salad just like the man recommended and was plain ole floored."}
{"text":"I picked up some food from Papa Joe's on a Friday night to take home for dinner.  My husband loves ribs...but they were out of ribs so I got him a pulled pork sandwich.  AI ordered the cod and lots of side dishes.  The cod tasted like the oil to cook it was old.  The onion rings and shrimp all had that same old oil taste.  The pulled pork was OK.  The only really tasty item was the coleslaw.  I was so disappointed with this place and won't be going back again."}
{"text":"Was great food. loved the fried fish and Okra. The staff very friendly. 
My only problem was, I was the only white person in the place. The two young African American sitting next to me, were saying unbelievable racist rants about white people , not to themselves but very loud so I could hear it. The whole place heard it. No management intervened. Made me very uncomfortable and I will not go back."}
{"text":"Been coming here for 5 yrs and it has never disappointed. It's family owned and ran and the food is always so darn good! This is my \"go-to\" place for friends and family if they've never had it before."}
{"text":"Stopped by here for the first time today.  I got the 2-piece whiting with 3-piece shrimp, side of sweet potato tots, and a slice of cheesecake.  It was so good I wish I could give it 6 stars.  I'll definitely be back if I'm in the area."}
{"text":"My fav, catfish nuggets and fried okra so good! Love this spot. The catfish is my favorite on the menu and they also serve catfish nuggets. The jalape√±o hush puppies are also tasty. This is the perfect spot for a quick lunch with a soul twist to it they also have koolaid!!"}
{"text":"Some of the Best tasting Catfish that I've eaten out here in PHX. Reminds of what I used to get back home in East Texas. Turns out that most of Papa Joe's family are from Texas and they brought back those great tasting flavors to AZ. Nice!

Love their simple menu of tasty treats. Catfish, Cod, and Whiting are all available in both regular or spicy. They have Shrimp, Hot Wings, Chicken Strips, BBQ Brisket, BBQ Pork, Ribs, Hot Links as well as Burgers and then some. The choices of sides are also a bonus and include items like Collard Greens, fried Okra, Potato Salad, Cole Slaw, Jalapeno Hush Puppies, Mac & Cheese, Onion Rings, Sweet Potato Tater Tots, Beans ... too many to list them all.

Normally get the 3 pc Spicy Catfish with 4 Shrimp and a side of whatever with a giant Grape Drink. Boy that brings back the memories. My wife usually gets the Cod and Shrimp Basket with a side. I have not tried the BBQ yet but definitely have it on my radar for next time.

Papa Joe and his crew are extremely friendly and most helpful. Everything is very good and you can tell they put a lot of Love and Soul into their food. Don't forget a little Granny Ann's Sweet Potato Pie, Peach Cobbler, Cheese Cake, or Pecan Pie to finish off your meal.

Give Papa Joe a shout out and you will be pleased. Located in a small strip shop on the south side of Bethany and not in the hospital across street like the Yelp map suggest. TOUCHDOWN!

{"text":"I have driven by this place for the past year and always wondered if it was any good or not. Stopped in today for lunch and have a pulled chicken sandwich that came with two sides and a drink and a piece of pecan pieoffer less than $10. The sandwich was tasty and the chicken was moist. The slaw was creamy and the sweet potato tater tot's were a nice addition to the meal. Even the P con pie was very tasty. I will definitely go back to try more"}
{"text":"I was really craving some fish and chips and don't get me wrong. It was good. The only thing I did not like was the fact that they didn't have lemons or good hot sauce. They gave me a lemon packet because lemons are too expensive he said. Which I wouldn't have mind paying for a fresh lemon."}
{"text":"Well I finally gave Papa Joe's a try. I have driven by this place many times and have even had people tell me about it but just never made it. I took my mother to the eye Dr. today and thought it would be nice to go out for lunch after. This place popped into my mind because, once again. I had driven by just the night before. 
        We went in and checked out the menu on the wall. After going through about everything I ordered the catfish and shrimp as well as the 2 piece ribs combo. My mother ordered the catfish as well with the potato salad. Food came out pretty fast and I dug in. The catfish was fantastic!!! I ordered the spicy and it was full of flavor and cooked very well. I then reached over and tried the ribs. This was the only thing that did not floor me. They were very good but a bit to peppery for me. Good size ribs with lots of meat but still maybe a 3 on the 5 star scale. 
     The sides were wonderful. I had the onion rings and the okra with one order and the mac and cheese with the other. All of which were excellent. My mother loved her catfish and shrimp. Which reminds me, my shrimp was very good and would love a big plate of those guys. 
       All in all I would strongly recommend Papa Joe's. I will be back for more of that catfish and just about everything else I can try. 

One last thing, the pecan pie was excellent. I could not resist. I wanted to try the sweet potato pie but they were out so I had the pecan instead. I was not unhappy with my choice."}
{"text":"I love Papa Joes Restaurant very clean environment respectful employees an the food is always Hot Always fresh Cook very well done My opinion this is the Number 1 restaurant in Phoenix A salute Papa Joe's Restaurant I recommend anybody to eat there!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"This is my 2nd time here in 2 day's. The fish here is off the hook. I have tried the whiting and cod. I preferred the whiting. The shrimp that comes with combo is delicious as well. And the sweet potato pie was a nice treat to finish up my meal. Next time I will try the BBQ."}
{"text":"What - you want fried fish - COME HERE!!!  Cannot tell you how friggen good this fish is. Their menu has different kinds of you can choose from like whiting, cod, catfish and each order comes with 2 fried shrimp.  The fried is lightly breaded & crispy fried - not heavy drowned in batter fried. Food is reasonably priced and the folks there are super nice.  Support the locals and visit if you are in the mood for fried fish or even wings cause they got them too!!  Much love to Papa Joe's!"}
{"text":"The man taking orders was super nice and explained the different types of fish to me as I am not familiar with southern food. The food itself was delicious! The okra and greens were perfect sides too. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Tried this place yesterday for the first time based on the high ratings and was not disappointed! The spicy catfish was excellent! I also enjoyed the mac and cheese and hush puppies, if you order a combo I would say definately skip the fries and sub for another side. I will be coming back but will probably call my order in next time to avoid waiting. Great food and reasonable prices, can't beat it!"}
{"text":"Can't tell you how many times I have passed by this place! I'm glad I didn't the night I stopped in. This area lacks fish and chip spots so I'm happy I found one! 

They have quite the variety of things to order. I ordered the spicy whiting with french fries. The fish was perfectly cooked, crispy, and flaky. The fries I didn't care for unfortunately and I couldn't tell that my order was the spicy version. I would have preferred the fish to have some kind of kick to it. 

I definitely want to come back though and order other items off the menu. Wish it was in a different area since parking is limited. 

This might be my new favorite spot in the area. Everyone working there was very nice and you get a very homely feeling when you walk in.

If they made changes to the fries and the spicy issue it would be closer to a five star rating. Restaurants with great fried fish are hard to find out in Arizona so I'm glad I was able to find this spot."}
{"text":"I came here based totally on Yelp reviews and really impressed!  I had the original catfish. The fish was hot and fresh and the breading was perfect. Crispy, not hard like at other places in Phoenix. A little stingy with the tartar, though.  The coleslaw was fresh and chilled. Perfect!  For $7, a great lunch."}
{"text":"This was my first time here. The menu gravitates to the fried fish. I did not order the fish. My eyes got focused on the pulled brisket sandwich. The pulled brisket was good but, I have had softer pulled brisket before. I was disappointed at the jalape√±o hush puppies. I could not taste the jalape√±o so it was more corn bread than jalape√±o. The coleslaw was good. Sorry people for the short review but, maybe next time I should go for the fish menu instead. My take is to give it three stars because it is a place that you need to try other menu items."}
{"text":"Today is National Catfish Day, so I thought of having a fried catfish meal at Papa Joe's. I definitely was not disappointed. I ordered the one-piece catfish combo; this included a humongous fillet of catfish. Good thing I decided to order only one piece; two would have been too much for me, even though an additional filet would not have cost much more. The combo also included some fried shrimp, a side (I chose potato salad), and a drink (iced tea for me). The catfish was really good - the fillet was tender, hot, and  juicy and was covered with a light, crunchy batter. They gave me 3 fried shrimp instead of the 2 that was supposed to come with the combo - I'm not complaining about that ;) and the potato salad was quite good. Everything - including the drink - for $6.05 plus tax. It's rare to come across a place that serves food this good and tasty for so little money."}
{"text":"Most delicious fried fish ever! Had the whiting and it was perfect. Even liked the French fries. Daughter had the wings which were ok and babe had the pulled pork sandwich...delicious!"}
{"text":"Papa Joe's is my absolute favorite fish place in Phoenix.  The food is incredible!!"}
{"text":"Tried here last weekend! We had catfish, okra, and onion rings, all very good! Not a fancy place but don't care about that, came for the food!!! Large portion size, recommend 1 fish not two, so full! My only concern was we got mild not spicy on the fish and it still was a bit spicy for us! We both suffer from heartburn so try to eat less spice! But never the less everything was tasty! Really far from home but if in area would visit again!"}
{"text":"That's what it'll be I said to myself as I drove the 20 miles down to the Doctors office from NW Phoenix, Papa Joe's Fish and 'Cue!  I had read the Yelp reviews and had wanted to go for weeks now.  So on the way back from sitting for 30 minutes in an MRI tube, I stopped at what I was sure was going to be a grand slam.  Kind of a rough part of Bethany Home Road but I figured it should be ok and it was, don't let it scare you off.  Walked in and the place was full of people but no one had any food in front of them and since it was nearly 1 PM, I figured everyone is already done with lunch (wrong).  Ordered the brisket sandwich and two sides for around $6.50, reasonable enough and even comes with a drink.  I was order #17.  I waited for my to-go order by the side counter.  After about 10 minutes they called #10 and that was my first red flag.  I thought this could be awhile.  Sure enough a few minutes later they called #11, then #13.  Twenty minutes in they called #8 and it was pretty obvious they lacked institutional restaurant control.  One of the patrons walked up to the counter and asked for his money back, that he couldn't wait anymore.  I asked how long he had been waiting and he said an hour and a half.  At 35 minutes and really late for work I asked for my money back and they said it was coming right out.  Oops, turns out #14 was coming out not #17.  At that point I just walked out with the nice lady behind the counter telling me she would give me my money back.  I just kept walking and will dispute the charge later with AmEx.  They seemed like really nice people, the place was clean, and (supposedly) the food is good.   The questions you have to ask yourself is, \"Do I feel lucky?\" and \"Do I have the disposable time to wait up to 90 minutes for BBQ\" -especially when Bobby-Q's is a mile up the road and I can get my meal in under 5 minutes.  Very disappointing."}
{"text":"Had the pulled pork sandwich, fried okra, mac-n-cheese, and sweet potato pie. With a drink the bill came up to under $10. Great food and great prices."}
{"text":"MMM MMM MMM that's what I said as I salmmed down my fried whitting, collards and cornbread. Freshly cooked too order so expect to wait. What a gr* spot for soul food. Price ranges from 7-9 bux and you get 2 pcs of fried fish and 2 pcs of shrimp with most fish combos. Delish. Check it out!"}
{"text":"1st time here, the food is good. Cornbread is great. Brisket fell apart, bbq sauce was bad for me. I am from Kansas. I don't like vinegar based bbq. Mac and cheese was decent. On the potato salad it was mustard based. It was all very good taste wise, I just like different base material."}
{"text":"Went there with a friend for lunch Friday and again AMAZING!! The catfish and shrimp combo is the best. Affordable, tasty, and the staff are so polite and professional. Also try the catfish nuggets so much for a small price my friend loved it."}
{"text":"I wanted to find a good soul food restaurant while here in Phoenix. Being from the east coast, I'm use to a certain type of soul food restaurants. First, I prefer my sandwich on sliced bread and not a bun and I expected two pieces of fish for a sandwich versus one piece received. The mac & cheese i'm sure is prepared either daily (at least I hope) or it was from the day before, very average. I ate one of the onion rings, cause I had enough of the fried food taste from the fish. 
Be prepared to wait upwards of 15mins for your ordered main dish, cause again the sides are pre made and sitting in a warming container. I'm still looking for a good soul food spot."}
{"text":"OMG......it's sooooooo good! I always complain that food is gross in Phoenix, but after my first time here.....I can't say that anymore! The spicy catfish is to die for. We ordered a family dinner with mixed regular and spicy catfish. The sides were really good as well! They are friendly, it doesn't take all day for your food to be ready and it is delicious. You have to try it!"}
{"text":"Love the food here it's always good and the service is good as well. Only sad part is that this is far from my home."}
{"text":"This is THE spot in Phoenix for fried fish and shrimp. My two buddies and I each enjoyed orders of two catfish pieces that also came with three shrimp, drinks and one side. we got fried okra, sweet potato tots, collard greens and an extra order of jalape√±o hush puppies. The cost was very affordable at about $28 total. It was fantastic! The fish pieces were actually fillets that appeared to be very fresh, lightly dusted with breading and lightly fried. We got the spicy with is more of just some added pepper but it's delicious. 

Comparing this to somewhere like Pete's Fish and Chips seems laughable as this is everything Pete's should be but isn't. The breading here is not overstated, everything seems fresh, it's delicious and you get a lot for around $8 per person. I'll definitely be back and I highly recommend Papa Joe's to everyone reading this review!"}
{"text":"I would definitely eat here again.  The owner, Papa Joe & his wife are very nice & friendly.  Papa Joe came out of the kitchen & chatted with the customers.  His wife makes the best peach cobbler I have had since living in Arizona.  Great atmosphere & eating environment."}
{"text":"Heard and read many great things about this place so I decided it was definitely worth trying. Came here on a Thursday night, I would say right at the beginning of time what most people would be getting out of work and starting to look for dinner. Got there and the place was packed. There was a line 4 parties deep to place an order at the register. Ordered the catfish with jalepeno hushpuppies. Though the food was decently well flavored, it was not as impressive as I had hoped. The worst part of this experience was the wait. I kid you not, orders were coming out one every 20-25 minutes. And I hate to exaggerate and try my best to never do so when it comes to a matter that can negatively impact another person's business, but I was there for 50 minutes to the second before mine rung up. I, along with people who placed orders before and after me showed higher levels of frustration by the minute. If you must try the place, do yourself a favor and order ahead. And whatever time they tell you on the phone, it be best you yourself tack an additional 20 minutes."}
{"text":"First time trying Papa Joe's we'll see how it is...

For the price it's really hard to beat Papa Joe's

I had catfish, shrimp and okra, all fried along with macaroni & cheese. The catfish, shrimp and okra were all good. Actually the fried okra was really good, who knew you could get fried okra in Arizona? The macaroni & cheese was nothing special, I probably won't get it again but I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Well if you're reading this you must care about what your dining on right? We just had the best fish in 35 years in the valley, tops Papadeaux's and all of the high-end Scottsdillian aquatic eateries and it's on 20th ave and Bethany Home !, been there for 5.5 years, Mom and Pop place,great pricing and service, but all the food ,cod ,catfish and the shrimp tasted like it was just caught and cooked up just for you to enjoy. Papa Joe's Fish-n Que 2019 W. Bethany Home Rd.602-973-7003
 If it's too far, or any other reason you wont go, your going to miss a real treat, Phoenix is  very lucky to have them here. The reviews I write seem to be well recieved ,I can be trusted to tell it like it is ,no holds barred, food is VERY important to me."}
{"text":"Calling all catfish lovers!!! You can order it spicy, (which I like), or regular but either one will be crisp yet super moist and tender on the inside. Don't worry about needing any sauce because it's full of flavor on it's own but they are available if you like."}
{"text":"So I was craving some fried fish and decided to try this place out.  OMG this place is by far the best fried fish in Phoenix.  I definitely recommend this place.  It is decently priced and the fish fillets are huge.  They are perfectly breaded and those jalape√±o hush puppies are ridiculously delish."}
{"text":"First thing to clarify: the restaurant is not in the hospital. It is located across the street. Took me forever to find them, especially since the Maps app takes you to the hospital parking lot. 

That out of the way, I arrived with a mean craving for catfish. I opted for the three piece, which came with four shrimps, a side and a drink. At about $12, that seemed reasonable enough. 

I ordered to go, so I didn't get the in house dining experience. It is very casual. There were a few tables seated when I arrived, and a few people in the back were watching the game on the television set hanging nearby. Total family diner style. 

It took about 10 minutes for my order to arrive. I found that the shrimps were perfectly seasoned. They were just...just so delicious. The catfish was curious. Of note, Papa Joe's has the seasoning and batter on point! It was so light and fresh! As though they grew the plants for the seasoning out back. But, strange thing, the catfish did not taste like catfish. It looked like catfish and smelled like catfish, but it was so very, very light. That was the only downfall. Other than that, very nice find."}
{"text":"I love this place!! This is the best catfish I've ever had. I also tried the fried chicken the time before and it was wonderful. I wish they were more centrally located but if I'm in the area I'll stop by. The only thing I think that needs improvement is the air, it was a little hot in there yesterday. Oh and they shouldn't charge .50 for a refill, that's a kind of \"ghetto\". Other than that very good!"}
{"text":"I have had better in many ways. But where do I start.

It took about 20 min to get our order. Not exactly a speedy lunch.

My $2 side of jalepno hushpuppies was very small consisting of 5 of them about the size of tatertots.

My whiting sandwich was just once price of fish where breading on t e bottom was soggy and a lackluster bun for $4.

Tartar sauce is rationed in small little cups.

The Ambiance is also lacking in this former quiznos, the floor still sports a Q, most of the burned out light bulbs have yet to be replaced and the Oder of something permeated my clothing.

Slow service, bad prices and medicore food, I just don't get it."}
{"text":"I love this place. Food is delicious and addicting. Customer service is beyond this world. There is nothing I don't like and I have tried just about everything."}
{"text":"I agree with the previous reviewers, this place is AMAZING!

I had the three piece spicy catfish. Outstanding.  Huge portions, lightly battered (not caked). Delicious. I love this place!

Service was great too.  The owner seems like a great guy and truly makes everyone walking in the door feel immediately at home.

If you are anywhere near here, don't miss out.

Note: It's got a small store front, blink and you'll miss it. And missing it would simply be awful."}
{"text":"BOMB. I was in Phoenix for a dentist app and I'm from California so we have soul food spots everywhere! The reviews don't lie! Stop in before my flight at the food is amazing! I had the 8p shrimp combo with okra! The staff is great and the food is made fresh to order so you may have to wait a bit! But other then that I would def recommend this place! I will be back next dentist trip!!!!"}
{"text":"I had the cajun catfish and fried okra.  The food was hot and fresh.  We ate around noon and there was a steady stream of people that came in as we dined...  It took about 15 minutes to get our food, but we weren't in a hurry."}
{"text":"I finally had an opportunity to try out this place after hearing more than a few people bring it up, so for lunch today my family and I decided to check it out.  THIS is not the \"dine in\" spot. This is a \"get your food and eat it at a stoplight\" place. Seating is limited, and it is hot as the fish grease in there. My guess is that the place has a swamp cooler, which is no match for 96 degrees and 40% humidity and a 66degree dew point... Call ahead and take your time getting there. Our order took 45 minutes to get to the table.



Service was good, and the staff was courteous. No complaints there, so let's get down to the real reason we came... The food... I've read the reviews of others and wonder how many of the people giving 5 stars actually know how to cook. If you know your way around the kitchen and your pallet is set to good food and good quality, you won't like this place at all. The food picture on the website is NOT the food that came out of that kitchen today...



In fact, keep driving past this place and find yourself a Mandy's or a Pete's and you'll fair a whole lot better. My wife got the three piece catfish, which came with three shrimp. She choose the baked beans potato salad as a side. One shrimp in and she passed it to me. Not only was it some pre-breaded shrimp (which most places serve) but it was a low quality (like not restaurant grade) and tasted as if it was thawed and re-frozen or poorly stored. Terrible. The fish also appeared to be some pre-breaded frozen variety that was a half-step below Gorton's Fish Sticks.



I got the hot link sandwich because four ribs for $16.42 was pretty steep tome seeing as how Famous Dave's has four bones for $14.99 that comes with two sides and a cornbread.  When I drove around the back of the building there was no grill and no smoke coming out of anywhere, and I wasn't paying for any one's boiled/oven browned ribs. The hotlink was hot and flavorful but they're small and they're cut down the center like your grandma used to do weenies when you were 7, and crisscrossed on a hamburger bun. Tip: Get a bigger hotlink, keep the bun. People will eat it with plain white bread if it's right.



Fries were lackluster, just plan shoestrings. They could sprinkle a little Cajun spice (on them to give them a little more flair. The person who go it the worst was my daughter. She ordered a pulled pork sandwich that consisted of a scoop of dry pork with a dollop of bbq sauce in the middle of it. Needless to say, that went straight in the trash...



I still don't understand what took 45 minutes... Maybe they only have one microwave..."}
{"text":"Hands down the best catfish in town! The service was so fast didn't waste no time in having my order ready!! The purple cool-aid is a plus!!"}
{"text":"Our office ordered from here for the first time in 2014, and I have been HOOKED ever since! Their fried catfish nuggets ARE AMAZING as well as their onion rings and fried okra.

If you are in the mood for some GREAT TASTING southern cooking...try them out!

These are the best items I highly recommend 

*catfish fillets/nuggets
*fried okra
*onion rings
*ribs
*greens"}
{"text":"Catfish and Okra are the stars of this show.

The fries, potato salad, and the chicken strips were run-of-the-mill.

But the catfish (I tried only the spicy) was OUT OF THIS WORLD DELICIOUS.

Okra breading was not thick at ALL, which allows you to taste not only the fried breading but also the taste of the okra itself, which is a rare combination.

I love this place, and if you enjoy spicy food and fried catfish, hit this spot - you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Was in the area and hit yelp and saw this place so I decided to give it a try. Am I glad that I did. The food is delicious. I had the hot link sandwich with mac and cheese and onion rings. While the portions are on the smaller side, they make up for it in flavor 10 times over. My son had pulled pork with mac and cheese and corn bread. I tried a bite of the pulled pork and it was fantastic. Everything is home made and delicious. I will definitely be returning to try the shrimp."}
{"text":"It's been a year since I've eaten here but I'm writing the review now because I FINALLY remembered what this place was called!
My dad broke his neck the night before his wedding last year and was taken to Phoenix Baptist so we were looking for food nearby. We walked over here and were a little weary. However, this place is AMAZING. We ended up bringing extra food to the entire wedding party at the hospital so thank you Papa Joes for unknowingly catering the wedding!! 

I'll be making another trip here soon since I remembered what it was called ;) despite the 12 mile drive - soooo worth it!"}
{"text":"The last time I went there, and it is the last time, the food was not good at all. overcooked and the spice hand fell hard on the okra and catfish. I ordered no spice and got lots of spice. After I paid for my order, which was an order for 3 people, the owner said to me, my wife didn't charge you for some stuff. I've told her to write so I can read it. OK, rude! Suck it up and deal with your wife. I used to go there a lot and have sent a lot of business there but I feel that this is a business that has plummeted to poor, very poor in service and quality.  I have found MUCH BETTER downtown."}
{"text":"Thanks to Yelpers, I found a great place again. I was just driving through Phoenix on a long trip form Texas to California and I needed a place to get dinner after 9 hours of driving. I had a hankering for BBQ. When I saw that they had fish and BBQ, it peaked my interest. After a 6 mile drive from the hotel, I found the location and it looked nice from the outside. The construction on the street almost made me merge to the left which would be the wrong side.

Anyhow, as I walked in and saw the ordering counter on the left, I was greeted (by Joe?) and asked what I wanted. I wanted to try the Spicy cod and I wanted ribs. He recommended the Fish and Shrimp plate and I could get ribs for $2 each. So that's what I did. He asked if I wanted fries and I asked what he would recommend. He said the okra. Okra it is!

As I waited, I noticed the inside was cozy and kept nice and clean. There's a drink bar where you can get anything you want and the food prep happened right across the room. While trying to move into a position to see the TV better, I spilled my tea. Joe was more than gracious and came over to clean it up with out incident. I tried the tea and the lemonade. I like it when a BBQ place lets you get all the drink you want. That's the way it should be!

When my food came, I wasn't disappointed. There were 2 pieces of cod, 3 shrimp and okra. There was also some cocktail sauce and 3 packets of tartar. As for the ribs, they were nice and big, probably 7-8 inches each. They were covered in a delicious sauce. Both had some spicy pickled peppers as well. 

The Fish was nice and thick at about 1 inch! It was cooked very well and the batter was light. I ordered the spicy, but it wasn't too spicy for me. That was fixed with some hot sauce. The shrimp were good, about average. The okra was seasoned very well. I didn't need to dip it in anything. The ribs were delicious. Nice and meaty and a good smoky taste. I really liked the sauce as well. It had a great mix of spicy sweet and accented the ribs quite well. 

So the entire bill was about $15.00. Recall I ordered a combination and the extra ribs. It's not a bad deal at all considering the amount and quality if the food and the fact that it also included a drink. I can highly recommend this place. Yum."}
{"text":"Papa Joe's makes catfish the way it should be made - non-fishy, non-greasy, with a perfectly seasoned and light crust.  Good greens, good mac 'n' cheese, great jalapeno hushpuppies.  If you want catfish - this is certainly the spot to be.

I also tried a bite of the pulled pork which I thought was passable (the vinegar based bbq sauce was, however, marvelous) but not anywhere in the same league as the catfish."}
{"text":"Tried this place out today as my boyfriend had a hankering for some fried catfish. It has a very comfortable and welcoming atmosphere. I ordered the pulled brisket sandwich combo and my boyfriend got the 18 piece catfish nuggets. My brisket was delicious and tender with just the right amount of sauce. I decided to step outside of my norm (I never have liked fish) and try a piece of my boyfriend's catfish and it was amazing! It was so flavorful that I snatched a second piece. Definitely going back."}
{"text":"I love fish and this place was recommended and great recommendation.  I had the catfish and shrimp which was cooked to order and was delicious.  The catfish was seasoned well and nice and crispy.  The only draw back is that bread, pickle, and onions is not included but paid extra to have with my fish.  Being from the Midwest is how we do it and will be back."}
{"text":"I gave this place a try and I was not disappointed! I had the catfish nuggets and they were awesome. The breading was thin and crispy, but I ordered spicy and it was not even medium spice. I hope they just made a mistake when they battered them. I also had the sweet potato tater-tots and they were great!"}
{"text":"I'm new at writing reviews but I felt compelled to leave a compliment about this great little spot. Joe took our order, was very friendly an hospitable. I ordered the 2pc Spicy Catfish Combo, with Fried Okra and Jalape√±o Hushpuppies. No extra charge for substituting fries for Okra(nice)!
Everything on my plate was delicious, I will be coming back. Highly recommend !!"}
{"text":"It was good. I like the wings and mac and cheese. Will be back. Make sure to get spicy if you like flavor!!"}
{"text":"Now this is what 5-stars food is like. Its so so so good. I often get the 2 cat fish combo with shrimp and huskpuppies. Man. the white sauce, i think hoisomething...
Again not very healthy food but you know...you might die the next day so whatever."}
{"text":"Wasn't the worst I've ever tasted but I don't think it was worth the $45 I spent either. The Mac $ cheese & baked beans are tasteless. I expected the fish to be fried in corn meal but instead I'm pretty sure it was fried in flour. You can tell everything is fried in the same oil which is fine as long as it's clean. I'm definitely not a fan of the barbque sauce, not very much flavor. My boyfriend enjoyed the wings and the greens are also pretty good. Needless to say we won't be returning here."}
{"text":"If you've never been here before, just go.

Unless you don't like fried food - in which case, yeah probably avoid this joint.

The catfish / catfish nuggets are BOMB - and I don't have much to compare it to not having had much catfish, but the seasoning and flavor are out of this world.

The mac n' cheese was good and so were the greens but I didn't care for the okra (mushy) or the coleslaw (he puts sweet relish in it - and sweet relish ruins anything for me)... hush puppies were worth trying - but you absolutely must try the catfish.

I tried one of his wings - and it's not your average wing - it's practically half the damn bird.  Again, the seasoning was perfect and it was cooked to perfection.

We were greeted and our order was taken by Papa Joe himself.  Whenever I meet a local business owner who knows his product is money and yet remains humble and down to earth I'm instantly a fan.

He had a few recommendations - which reminds me, they have like four different kinds of Kool-Aid on tap and I suggest the cherry limeade.  This place is legit and I will most definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"Tried the catfish and the Mac n Cheese... wonderful

My kid had the pulled Brisket... yep brisket sandwich. YUMMY

Another great day at PJFNQ

PS they have limited Sunday hours but they are open."}
{"text":"Catfish is awesome! Jalape√±o hushpuppies also rock. But what makes the food is the perfect blend of horseradish in their cocktail sauce!"}
{"text":"So after trying probably the worst \"so-called soul food\" restaurant, we didn't want to waste anymore of our time. We've been in Phoenix for a year & a half. Nothing. That changed when we went to Papa Joes. Our friends suggested that we go & we trust their judgment. So here we go. 

We went in & ordered our food, sat down & waited for our number \"72\" to be called. Food took a little longer than anticipated but we waited. Then I heard 74, 75, 76, 77. At this point we're like wait, what's going on? The owner looked over at us and asked us what number we were & we told him. He asked the cook & apparently he forgot. Of course that was very upsetting. My husband now wanted to leave. But nonetheless,  the owner was concerned & apologized. They got our food together and it came right up. 

He ordered the wing dinner with Mac & cheese & peach cobbler with Pink lemonade.  I had the half & half spicy & mild catfish nuggets & a sweet potato pie & grape Kool aid.  Our meals, delicious. My catfish nuggets, more than amazing. Oh & the price for it all, no more than $25. We had just spent $55 for a little less food at Off Da Hook Soul Food & had the worst service & food. I didn't expect the catfish nuggets to be so big and it was a 12 piece.   

We want to go back today. Definitely getting the same thing. This time I'm going with greens. The mac was good but wasn't our favorite. So the wait was definitely worth it and the food, amazingly good. Best catfish we've ever had, hands down. 5 stars is a must."}
{"text":"I give this place 5 stars. I give all places 5, then \"take away\" stars for what's lacking. Excellent service (c'mon, it's just a small place, with the tables and the red checkered plastic tablecloths) and Papa Joe served me - older guy who looks like he's been around a while. Had fried fish 'n' chips and fried okra. Great! Good food, cheap prices - the only problem I had was the location - it's too easy to miss."}
{"text":"Let's just say... When living social came out with coupons, I bought 4. I get the spicy catfish every time and the jalapeno hush puppies are very good. Its another small business that you guys can support and feel good about because they deserve the business.

If you eat there, you will probably smell like the food they make. It used to be a Quiznos so the atmosphere could put some people off. Just order it to go and you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"The food is great!  Catfish is huge. Collard greens were excellent. People were very helpful and friendly"}
{"text":"Hands down Papa Joe has the best greens in the Phoenix metro area. Coming from Georgia, I know my greens! The catfish had a light cornmeal coating and was scrumptious. I would definitely order it again. The area was a little scary and intimidating but Papa Joe made us feel comfortable by greeting us at the door. He was very hospitable to my mother and me. If we are ever in the area again we will come back for more of Papa Joe's fixins!!"}
{"text":"Was looking for a good fish and chips in phx this is the place to go home style catfish breaded to perfection and the portions definitely delicious my new favorite spot"}
{"text":"Eating here again!
This place never disappoints. The catfish is amazing, the greens are awesome and the okra? Ohhhh the okra!!!
Good job papa, good job!
I have recommended this place to many people and they are always HAPPY, ALWAYS!!

Highly recommend, best fish in Phoenix!"}
{"text":"Checked out this place last night. Had the spicy catfish, Mac and cheese, and fries. Catfish was cooked very well. Not that spicy, but they had some franks and that made it great. Mac and cheese was on point. Fries were just average. For the price, this place was great. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Every time we visit Phoenix, we try some new food places...it's always a shot in the dark except for Yelp reviews. This evening, after a 475 mile drive from Santa Fe, we tried PaPa Joe's. 

PaPa Joe's is on a major East/West street not too far northwest of the central downtown area...about a 10 minute drive from 3rd and Thomas in moderate traffic.

The restaurant is in a small strip center that is loaded with active small businesses. The neighborhood is busy light commercial. Parking could have been a challenge but not this time, I pulled into the lot and had a spot immediately right at the restaurant entrance. Easy access.

The place is friendly, easy going, clean and neat. The menu is on the wall and includes a large variety of BBQ meats, fish and shrimp as well as a good selection of side dishes. It's order at the register, serve yourself when your number is called and bus it afterwards. The menu is also available on line and includes items not mentioned here...we were after BBQ and catfish. Comfortable setting.

With the idea of sharing our meals, she ordered a three rib combo with two sides while I had a two piece catfish combo with three shrimp and a side. My side was fried okra and hers were greens and sweet potatoes...There was plenty of food. We each had iced tea to drink. Less than five minutes after ordering, our food was out of the kitchen. It was presented in styro carry out boxes. The catfish was almost too hot to eat, crispy on the outside, moist and steamy on the inside. The fried okra was pretty typical of commercial fried okra and was tasty and hot. Her ribs were Kansas City style, quite large and meaty, tender and well cooked, the greens were home style, hot, tender and tasty...soft but not overcooked. The sweet potatoes were like Tater Tots, but as the rest, hot, tasty and cooked just right. Joe's BBQ sauce is a good combo of sweet and spicy unlike many that are poorly balanced and detract from the meat by overpowering it. There was plenty of sauce with the ribs but not too much. Good food, good portions.

While we were waiting for our food, I struck up a conversation with a fellow watching football on the wall mounted TV. It was PaPa Joe. He's a personable fellow but after a brief chat, had to get back to the kitchen...I wanted to talk some more but they were busy with the Saturday evening procession of carry out and eat in diners. Friendly.

$19.80 out the door...I did leave a tip in addition. In my opinion, a bargain given the good food, friendly atmosphere and fast service. I would go back and I would recommend it to a friend."}
{"text":"This is a run down hole in the wall but the catfish is unbelievable. They also have whiting, cod and shrimp.  The price was excellent too.  A combo with a drink and a side was  under $10..

The side of Mac and cheese wasn't the best but they made up for it when I had the collard greens.  

Don't wear anything fancy here just some jeans and sneakers and a large appetite.  

Yes!!! I'll come back.... Definitely!!!"}
{"text":"Best fried catfish in town!!! We get it spicy. Takes a little longer for large orders so call ahead....but so worth the wait. Local and very friendly owners. Best customer service.  Parking can be a slight challenge during busy hours and the restaurant is on the smaller side. But oh the food is awesome!"}
{"text":"First timer and I'm a happy like a fat kid eating cake but my cake was spicy fried catfish nuggets. *Drools* I had to repeat my order out to the nice man who took it because I purchased a whole meal and even added a side of corn bread... my total was $5.02, HOW!?!? I won't ask why bc I'm not gonna argue that, who would? The castfish was fried to perfection, perfect spice, Mac and cheese was thick n creamy, corn bread was FYE. Service was great too, they make you feel comfy. I will def be coming back, probably too often. Next time I'm trying the beef ribs, to be continued"}
{"text":"This was my first trip here after having look around for good southern food. I'm a fried catfish fanatic and I came especially to try it out and it was some of the best I've eaten. I got the 3 piece catfish with 4 shrimp meal with fried okra. I opted for the spicy version and it was just the right amount of spice.. Not too hot but just enough to taste.  Lightly battered with cornmeal and amazingly good. The shrimp were good but nothing compared to the fish and okra.  Now for the okra..OMG..lightly battered with great mix of seasoning made this some of the best I've had. Portions are large..I had one piece of fish leftover. 

There is also a lot of BBQ dishes and countless other options and sides. The guy who took our order which I'm assuming would have been the owner was super friendly and very enthusiastic about food. Very reasonable prices with a casual atmosphere. 

A great little find and I will definitely visit here many times in the future."}
{"text":"I really wasn't in the mood for some fast food so we quickly Yelped a fish place this restaurant came up nice little establishment I ordered the cod spicy with some shrimp took a few minutes as they prepped it fresh was nice and hot, tasted pretty damn good along w a splash of lemon , unlimited drinks at the soda fountain, I will com back to try the catfish n whiting fish next time"}
{"text":"I was craving soulfood one night and I didn't know where to turn! Lol. I'm originally from California Bay Area to be exact so we're super multicultural and we have so many soulfood and down south comfort food restaurants it's crazy! But since I moved to Arizona 9 months ago I hadn't found one the suited my tastebuds yet! Until last week it was almost 8 o clock I was craving and hungry I was yelping restaurants and PaPas was the only one that was still open. The nice gentleman took my order over the phone I drove about 7 minutes away and picked up my hot link combo with Mac and cheese, potato salad, baked beans, collard greens, and peach cobbler. I was highly satisfied and slept like a baby afterwards. The hot link was good ooh wee was it spicy one of the HOTTEST.... Hot links I have EVER had since Louisiana where my family's from. The Macaroni was A1 I am like guru of Macaroni and cheese so it says a lot, the collard greens were tender and seasoned to perfection, potato salad was good, and I could taste bbq sauce in the baked beans. I'm going back really soon... my new spot!"}
{"text":"Worse soul food I ever had. Waited 45 for a take out order. Ordered spicy fish tasted like plain cornbread. Hush puppies were not cooked all the way. Got the mac and cheese /Mac and cheese smelled horrible and  Tasted  just as horrible. Cheapest fries u can buy. Oh and the shrimp. Its that crap u get in the freezer section at your local grocery store. I want my husband's money back but it too far to drive"}
{"text":"Let me start with the restaurant itself....it's CLEAN! 
Second, the service- superb! They are extremely friendly and informative. I can't recall the last time I had such stellar service!
Finally, the food- delicious!
As a long time knock kneed lobster customer- searching for something a little closer and a little less $$- this is it. 
I had the spicy cod and shrimp- perfect. Greens- fantastic. Fried okra- also perfect. Cocktail sauce also prepared just right.
Husband had the spicy whiting which he loved along with the Mac n cheese and Cole slaw, all fantastic.
We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Been here a couple of times. The single catfish with mac N cheese: Catfish was delish! Crisped to perfection and tasty. The mac N cheese was decent, the noodles a bit over cooked but extra cheesy like I would make it at home.

The single whiting and sweet potato tots. OMG, who doesn't love sweet potato tots?!? I think they double fry it, but whatever they do, its got a crispy outside soft inside. I think the whiting was too \"fishy\" for me. First the look, the inner part was a purplish brown that didn't look appetizing and I put to the side. I didn't care for the smell.

The lady was super nice who took my order. The restroom was clean and she had to unlock it for me. The decor was hip and I liked it, they had the news going on the screen which I liked."}
{"text":"I have been to Papa Joe's Fish-N-Que only once, so I have only had a few things off of their menu to eat. Having said that, I don't feel that I can give as extensive of a review as I normally would. I got the pulled brisket sandwich, sweet potato tater tots, and jalapeno hushpuppies and everything I put in my mouth was delicious! The atmosphere wasn't that great, but I don't really go to restaurants for the atmosphere (and besides, I got my order to go anyway). I definitely plan on going back as soon as I can (I'm a poor grad student with very little free time) and I plan on ordering something else off of their wonderful-looking menu!"}
{"text":"I've been to Papa Joe's at least four or five times and have always had great service and food. 

They serve up fish, shrimp, ribs, pulled pork, wonderful side dishes like hush puppies and fried okra.

Each time I've been to Papa Joe's I have ordered the one piece spicy catfish (which isn't spicy) and two shrimp. The plate comes with fries, but you can substitute for a different side. I recommend the jalapeno hush puppies. They aren't spicy, like the jalapeno would indicate and are addictively yummy.

I've never had the pulled pork sandwich, but my husband has and says it's really good. 

They make home made sweet potatoe pie, which I have yet to try, but I certainly will soon as it looks soooo good.

The people that own Papa Joe's are very friendly and accomodating and aside from the good food the people make it worth coming back."}
{"text":"Went here because of Yelp reviews.  I was not disappointed.  The spicy catfish was very good. Not impressed with the french fries. I will go back to try some of the other menu items.
Restaurant was clean and the folks there friendly."}
{"text":"Excellent deep fried fish, nice crispy outer shell for a good cooked fluffy and flaky meat for a great meal. The baked beans I can never get enough. My nice dinner run on the weekends."}
{"text":"The folks who run this place are really sweet! I tried the fried shrimp and mac and cheese first visit. Shrimp was crunchy and just spicy enough. Mac and cheese was yummy gooey and creamy. I could see the real cheddar in there!

Second trip I tried the brisket sandwich, fried okra, and cornbread. Very generous pile of tender brisket was great, but I am not a huge fan of the vinegary bbq sauce. Just a personal preference, but I prefer it sweeter. Fans of the sassy vinegar bbq will probably love it. I love that the fried okra was a bit spicy; nice touch. Next time I will request it extra crispy. The bits that were a bit burned tasted heavenly. Cornbread was perfectly sweet, fluffy, moist and corny.

Washed down with their delicious lemonade. I will definitely be back to sample other menu items. I love that its a mom and pop as I like to support local businesses especially when they go out of their way to make you feel welcome!"}
{"text":"Oh, yeah, this is the good stuff!! Best catfish in town!!"}
{"text":"Stopped in purely from yelp star reviews and so happy we did. I had the two piece cod one spicy and one not. I preferred the non spicy but the spicy was good also. It came with French fries and 3 pieces of shrimp. My husband had the spicy catfish combo and enjoyed also. They have ribs and hamburgers and other sandwiches also so if your not into fish you have  other options."}
{"text":"Good news:  cod and mac & cheese hits the spot. Food was hot and service very quick.  

Bad news: okra was thick and tough, potatoes in salad were undercooked.  

Tips:  Fix ventilation system so smoke is exhausted to outside.  Play some R&B music.

I will definitely give this place another try because I like the soulful, homey atmosphere.

{"text":"Update: 8/8/17
I tried their 2 Pc beef ribs with jalape√±o hush puppies & cornbread.  Equally as good.  You don't even need the sauce, whatever their rub is..was very flavorful.

Decided to drive in early for bowling so I can give this place a try.  Seen & passed by for years when in this area.  I ordered the 1 piece cod w/sweet potato tater toys (combo incl. 2 fried shrimp) and I added a piece of spicy catfish.  Everything was seasoned well, good size portions, lightly breaded, Not Greasy and cooked perfectly.  They also serve BBQ meats, but I did not try that this time.  It's located in a strip mall next to the bowling alley.  Parking is limited, depending on the time of day you come.  The place is a small mom & pop place with about 8 tables.  The lady is very cordial.  Definitely check this place out and I would come back again!"}
{"text":"Papa  Joe's  Had fried  catfish combo  first  time  food was great. Clean  nice  atmosphere catfish seasoned Just right will return.."}
{"text":"I'm sure just like the other reviews , this place is the bomb! Catfish nuggets are great as well as everything else . Does get busy so either so phone order or you may ya e a little wait but it's definetly worth it ,"}
{"text":"My wife happens to be from the South.   So after we de-planed at PHX and picked up our rental, she naturally found this place on Yelp as we driving!

Papa Joe's isn't in the most glamorous part of Phoenix.  In fact, you may feel a little nervous around this neighborhood.  My wife and I didn't have any trouble though.   We parked in the strip mall parking lot where Papa Joe's is. 

Walking inside, this a hole-in-the-wall mixed in with some down home love.   Papa Joe's is a very nice, gracious man.   And his son is really great too. 

My wife did all the ordering:  6 pieces of catfish, 2 orders of fried okra, an order of peach cobbler and an order of fried green tomatoes. 

Now unlike my wife, I'm in LA boy.   When I first heard my wife utter \"catfish,\" I was already thinking about how it was going to taste like it had sand in it.   I also wasn't too thrilled that everything ordered was fried, except for the cobbler.  

But I worried for nothing... The food here is amazing.    The fried catfish was so damn good, that I've told so many people about it.   I can't wait until my next business trip into Phoenix and Scottsdale to go back here.  

The okra, tomatoes, and cobbler were off the charts too. 

If you're from the South, or are looking for some good cooking, you have to come here."}
{"text":"you wont leave hungry the portions are perfect and the fish is really tasty(On Point!!!) but the greens and the mac and cheese needed a little help, next time I'll stick to fries"}
{"text":"Long wait, greasy , frozen, flavorless food... Only been here once and I will never return, not even it was free.

 I placed my order over the phone and was told it would be ready in 20 minutes. I only live 6 minutes away so I left my home at perfect timing to get there at the time they requested.... 5 minutes later... 10 minutes later... 15 minutes later... Did I mention I was the only one waiting? 

They had fruit punch that tasted like water and sugar... The man cooking wrote his phone number on a napkin for me (not happening)... 

if I you don't believe how terrible the food here was please ask one of the other 2 people that ate their food with me that day.  The order was for 3 people, not one of us liked it nor will we ever go there again...."}
{"text":"WOW!...was my first word that came flying out of my mouth..when I walked into Papa Joe's Fish n Que! The homey restaurant is immaculate..and very nicely decorated. Has a warm and nice touch and flare for New Orleans decor. Being a BAMA girl..I love my fried catfish and shrimp..so that is what I tried. After talking to Janet ( her family owns & works Papa Joe's) she told me the catfish is fresh and hand seasoned (to perfection, I might add) They have several catfish and shrimp options...I went with the 3 piece Catfish w/ 4 fried shrimp...it normally comes with french fries, but Janet said I could have my choice of a side instead. Which I opted for because my mouth was already watering for the mac and cheese...I also added a side of turnip greens and a slice of pecan pie. What is really a nice surprise..the cold drink comes with the combo meal..and they threw in a free piece of cornbread, wrapped in a cupcake wrapper. OK...I rolled up my sleeves and dug in!! OH LAWD...the catfish is to die for...perfectly seasoned and fried...3 huge whole catfish fillets, (no half fillets here) Dang! it was so delicious...I had to stop myself from eating the last fillet..cuz, I wanted some for dinner later. The shrimp is just as great..steaming hot and perfectly cooked! The mac n cheese is creamy and cheesy and heart stoppingly addictive..not overcooked and bland. My turnip greens were just glistening in their pot likkor, to which i let my cornbread sop up that delicious elixir..and then when no one was looking..I picked up the bowl and drank with delight the yummy pot likkor from the greens!! I could not stop smiling..while eating my gastronomic delight...it just made me so happy. I just had to meet Rodney (he's Janet's son and was in the front making some fries) and Papa Joe.. ( the owner and names sake) was very friendly..to tell them how delicious their labor of love was!! A very nice, warm and friendly family...where you can tell they put their heart and SOUL..into this wonderful little gem of a Fish n Que joint! I highly recommend the catfish, shrimp, greens, mac n cheese, and pecan pie!! i didn't have my glasses with me..so I couldn't read the full menu..BUT..I know they have some wonderful  BBQ...and maybe next time (if I can get passed that catfish) I will try some of their BBQ'd items! Definitely 2 THUMBS UP and a 5 star review from this satisfied localvor (local) eater!! I will be blogging on my Face book page and sharing Papa Joe's Fish n Que Restaurant!
P.s. I only came to know about this gem..through the Living Social Coupon...and I'm so glad I did!! You won't be disappointed!! I\"m glad I bought 2 of those Living Social Coupons..I will Definitely be back for more!! Thank you!  EAT LOCAL!!!"}
{"text":"Oh my god. Soooooooo good. My order took a while but it paid in dividends. I had the cod and shrimp, top shelf stuff."}
{"text":"Ahh, this place makes me think of \"Coming to America\" with Eddie Murphy.... \"Just let your soul glow... just let it shine through!!!\"  This is some of the best soul food in town.  My usual staple for soul food has traditionally been Lo Lo's Chicken and Waffles, but I know that if I'm looking for fish and chips, I'm coming to Papa Joe's.   

I had the 2 piece spicy catfish and shrimp; the portions are generous, the catfish is wonderful -- he uses a real light breading on the catfish and a thicker, crunchier breading on the shrimp.  I like the that the catfish was reasonably mild in flavor, although he has an option for spicy breading.   Standard fare includes fries, although I opted for the jalapeno hush puppies, which did not disappoint.    

The shady neighborhood and bullet holes in the windows add a nice touch to give you that authentic experience as well."}
{"text":"THE best spicy catfish in town!  When I'm in the area I always stop. I've tried the barbecue and it is great too. But, it's the catfish that keeps me coming back for more. Prices are good too. I never leave hungry!  Oh, and don't forget the okra or onion rings. Mmmmmmm!"}
{"text":"Not bad at all for a small joint. Pretty tasty fish, price is i think a lil high cuz the the cod fiah wasn't too big. Catfish was nice size, service is ok, ok setting inside. Outaide patio seating..id come bak if i was craving fried fish.."}
{"text":"I was killing time in the neighborhood waiting to shop with a friend and saw the great reviews on Yelp. I won't lie, being a Soul Food spot, I wanted to see if there were any reviews from Black people who said it was good...a legitimate metric! The reviews did not lie. 

Customer service was great. The owner came from behind the counter to explain the menu on the wall to 
newbies who lingered. Your food is cooked fresh, so expect to wait 15 minutes or so for your order. The restaurant has seating for about 20 customers, and a couple of tables on a small patio. Very unpretentious, but clean. It's all about the food. 

I ordered the one piece spicy catfish combo, which came with two pieces of shrimp,two sides and a drink for six bucks. Really??? And it was plenty. 

The fish was well-seasoned, piping hot and not greasy. The collard greens were good. Not bland, but not as flavorful as my taste buds prefer. Nothing a packet of hot sauce can't solve. But they won at having a smoky flavor without being greasy. The jalape√±o hush puppies? Pure perfection! I added the peach cobbler, which was wonderful. I like lots of crust, and it delivered. 

In a nutshell, I will drive out of my way to come back. It's worth the drive."}
{"text":"Who would have thought if I wanted a good fish fry I would have to make the trip back to the area I formally lived in? Now let's get down to what I ordered I got the 3 piece catfish with 4 shrimp and greens as my side on top of that I ordered a hot link sandwich because my cholesterol isn't as high as it should be says the doc now the greens this was my first time ever having greens and I have been missing out flavorful and tender I lapped that shit up the shrimp was excellent good sized the catfish is very good good seasoning and it bites back (crunch) if your brave or fat go for the 3 piece meal. Now on to the hot link sammich for once I had a hot link sandwich that has heat to it clearly cooked not reheated. All and all this place is a gem I may have been late coming here but I'm glad I made it."}
{"text":"This is my 3rd time eating. Here and the food is always fresh and tasteful great job keep up the good work. Papa joe if you like southern this place is it."}
{"text":"Wanted to try southern food this week so I decided to make my way to Papa Joe's Fish N Que. Upon entering I noticed that the design of the restaurant was pretty neat. I had trouble finding out where the menu was at first, found it was posted near the door, which I thought was an odd choice. Finally settled with something simple. Catfish with fries and fried shrimp, spicy. Placed my order...waited...waited...waited. For only one other group of people it took about 20 minutes to finally get my food. For somewhere with an emphasis on lunch hours, it sure took awhile. Sat down and started on my meal. Catfish was buried under all my fries so I felt compelled to eat most of the fries first. Personally, I found them bland. It's possible that other people prefer fries this way, but I just found it tasteless. Went for the fried shrimp. Pretty good especially dipped in the cocktail sauce. Lastly, had the catfish which was good. Was juicy and cooked well. Fell apart on my fork which increased the difficulty in eating. Also, I noticed nothing spicy about the catfish. Bummer. I love seafood but I've had better, way better, but I'm guessing for the price it makes sense. 

All in all it was...ok. I was really underwhelmed especially after reading all the rave reviews. Of course I'm basing this off one item on menu but that's the experience I had. I just feel there is nothing at this particular place that is unique or above and beyond anywhere else with similar food and style. Not bad, but I probably wouldn't come back."}
{"text":"This place is the perfect if you have a taste for some good ole soul food! Def on fleek!"}
{"text":"We were looking for a good place to have fish and chips and I found this place on Yelp. I agree with the other reviewers that say this place is very good. It is a simple place in a strip center and I probably wouldn't have just stopped by, had I not read the reviews. We had the spicy catfish and the cod. I had the okra which is one of my favorite things in the world and it was very good. It was not greasy and everything was freshly made. We were greeted with a smile and made to feel very welcome. We definitley will be back."}
{"text":"My hubby and I just had lunch at papa'Joe's. YUM to the 10th power! Marc had a burger( like always) he loved it. I had two piece cod and 3 shrimp. The Cod was better than i've ever had. How do I know? I used hardly any tarter and I ALWAYS use a ton of tarter. They were just so delish!  Two friendly guys working there. Next time- 3pc cod:) and I want to try the macNcheese."}
{"text":"Food was great,and it's a clean environment. The smooth jazz and classic funk helps digest the food,I think? All in all a great experience"}
{"text":"I'm a Seattlite (yes, that's really what we call ourselves) who has lived in Arizona for 12 years, searching for good fish and chips.  I finally found the place.  Papa Joe's catfish hit the mark: fresh, flaky, lightly breaded with a bit of spice in the mix, and perfectly cooked.  I'm sooo happy to have found this place.  It is definitely more of a southern type of joint than typical northwestern fish and chips with clam chowder and beer batter.  Papa Joe's instead offers a variety of comfort food sides including sweet potato tots, Mac and cheese, or fried okra. No chowder. They do have a full BBQ menu too, which we didn't try.  3 of us ate well for under $25.  We will definitely go back."}
{"text":"The best soul food restaurant Phoenix has to offer. The staff here is just awesome I had the spicy catfish and BBQ ribs dinner."}
{"text":"Excellent! Support family owned small business. The Catfish is amazing perfectly seasoned and breaded to fry to perfection. Not oily at all. Orders take some time to be ready but  everything is made fresh. Parking can be difficult due to sharing with other small businesses. But overall great!!! I am happy I found this great Fried Fish little joint."}
{"text":"Just had a great lunch here.  All my favs.  Fries okra, grape koolaid, jalape√±o hush puppies, BBQ.  I'll be back.  More to try!"}
{"text":"I have been in Phoenix for under a year and have already found the best Catfish in town!!! I meant to take a picture but as soon as I saw it I gobbled it up.  Jalape√±o Hush puppies are good as well.  Came right before closing so missed out on Mac and cheese.  The Greens are also good as well and the Peach Cobbler. I will definitely be returning.  Great Service Great Food and Great Price!!!!"}
{"text":"First time visit. Interior is plain and old, but clean. Service is mediocre at best and it does take quite a while to get your food after ordering. I had the catfish and shrimp basket with mac n cheese. Food was fresh and hot. Not bad overall, but a little pricey for what you get. Doubt I will return."}
{"text":"Very friendly place on a casual Saturday noon. This place is clean and tidy. The order was ready in a reasonable time. 

The recommended catfish was wonderful in taste and texture. The spicy version is harmless. The beautiful 8\" filet is covered in a crispy seasoned fish fry crust disguising the white tender juicy and flakey catfish. It had the qualities of freshly caught seafood. Without prior knowledge of jalape√±o hushpuppies, they came as a fantastic discovery! 

The 5\" cod had the same great seasonings but couldn't compete with the catfish in that juicy fresh taste. The oil used tasted clean and new. The cornbread was simple as cornbread could be. The quality butterfly shrimp is a great accompaniment. If you give the lemonade a chance, you may detect the cozy hint of honey. I will visit again."}
{"text":"What a disater and a wasre of 1 hour. Ordered the fried cod spicy and 3 shrimp with a side of fried okra. Ten minutes after I ordered I added 1 pork rib which was $3.00, wow. Ten minutes later my rib arrived without my fish. The rib was 1/2 cold and 1/2 hot, definately microwaved. The rib wss tough as leather and dificult to get off the bone. Another 10 minutes passed and I asked about the fish. They finally located it and in 10 minutes it arrived. The small filets were only partially breaded and were mushy. Rather than the fresh fis I expected, they brought back my childhood nightmares of frozen fish sticks. The shrimp were boxed frozen and tastless. The saving grace was the fried okra was ok and the elderly order taker did offer a free desert for the long wait. I declined as I just wanted out of there."}
{"text":"Terrible food I wouldn't consider this Southern at all the fish was fried terribly the flavor was horrible we've been here on two different occasions both time my boyfriend got the spicy catfish and I got the regular catfish the first time the catfish was good but the second time both orders tasted terrible I will never return"}
{"text":"Love this place, every time I come I get the spicy catfish nuggets, side and a drink for $5. If you like catfish, then Papa Joe's should be a place you are talking about, theirs is cooked to perfection. Their collard greens will cause you to have regular cravings. Great spot to have in the area."}
{"text":"I had a wonderful lunch here today.  I was looking for something new and yelp steered me here.  I had the brisket with mac n cheese and jalape√±o hushpuppies.  I've driven by here for years and never stopped, I won't make that mistake again."}
{"text":"This is a great find. The sauce isn't my favorite - it's a bit on the peppery side but it's still delicious. The catfish is some of the best I've had. Very clean place and nice people. Good prices too."}
{"text":"Catfish is on point! This place is super good. Fried Okra is also awesome. Everything is fried lightly so you dont leave in a food coma. Try it if you haven't yet. 

Owner seems to always be there and you can tell that he and the staff genuinely care about their customers, and not in an obnoxious, over-bearing kinda way."}
{"text":"The peach cobbler is astounding, ask them to warm it up. I read a few bad reviews of this place so i was nervous to try it. My food took about 5 minutes to come out. I ordered the 2 pc. Catfish/shrimp comes with a side and a drink. The catfish was outstanding. Lightly fried and hot to touch. The mac n cheese was good too, and the lemonade was delicious. I was impressed and i would return."}
{"text":"I was really skeptical of this place because I lived in Phoenix almost 10 years and never been here, passed by bit several times as a matter of fact. But...I went to lunch here with a friend and had the 1piece catfish combo and I was pleasantly surprised! Okay here are the pros and con's:
Pros: Taste is on point! Seasoned well but not salty. No weird old fish taste. Food was piping hot. Also, they were relatively quick with putting out our order. They were very polite and the cost was VERY inexpensive!

Cons: the smallest combo came with 1piece of fish 2 shrimp, side and drink. While its nice all are included in the city combo the two little shrimp includes were well...funny to me.

That's it, I will definitely go back when I am back in Phoenix!"}
{"text":"Finally got a chance to stop in and check it out.  Got the catfish cod and hush puppies.  Overall the atmosphere was okay, nothing special.  The food was good.  First time I've ever had good catfish.  All the ones I've had before were always really oily with a unique taste.  This one was soft and dry(not oily) with a nice breading.  The cod had a good breading but was dry on the inside.  Unlike other reviews, I wasnt too impressed with the jalape√±o hush puppies.  The tarter sauce was good tho.  I did find it kinda wierd that although they had their fountain drink out in the dining room, they had a sign that said 50 cent refills, never saw that before."}
{"text":"One of the very few places that I can go to in a Phoenix and get truly good mac and cheese. Every time I go, the food is done right!"}
{"text":"Pretty good place! My friends would come quite often because they bowled close by every week. 

I've tried the fish and chips, as well as the bbq ribs and Mac and cheese and sweet potato tots! All we delicious.

The workers were kind. But the area can be a little \"scary\" if you're a single woman at night. Lol. So go with some friends and eat some good food :)"}
{"text":"best catfish in town, taste as if he poured butter all over it after it was fried."}
{"text":"I had a hankering for some fried and thought I'd give this place a try based on many of the positive reviews from my fellow Yelp community.  
After trying it, I have to say there isn't one ounce of regret in doing so....read on.

Location & Aesthetics - Located in in Phoenix on Bethany Road opposite the Phoenix Baptist Hospital.
The restaurant isn't difficult to miss with their large sign but the street can be busy with traffic behind you so it's not easy to slow down and you can miss it if you don't know where it is.  Thankfully my trusty phone GPS pinpointed the exact spot.
Parking can be somewhat difficult as the parking spots are limited and whatever are available are shared with other businesses.  
There is a small street parallel to Bethany Road that must be used to access the restaurant and some of the other businesses and I believe one can park there as I saw a customer parking there but don't quote me on this.  
The restaurant itself is a bit dimly lit but there are large windows in front that provide light.  The restaurant is a bit old too and could probably use a sprucing up in redecoration as some of the ceiling tiles had prior leak spots/stains.  The restaurant itself, most importantly, was very clean.  

Menu - Clearly visible but not above or behind the cashier/order/checkout area but rather to the left on the wall.  Clear and concise.   

Service - The staff was spectacularly nice, friendly, warm and welcoming.  Any questions were answered promptly.    

Food - I had the whiting and my wife had the catfish.  Mind you, I have never had or tasted these two particular types of fish.  The side I had with mine was the fried okra (yet another item I've never had) and my wife had the coleslaw.
The fish was well fried with not too much batter and very well seasoned.  It was soft and tender and didn't have any briny taste to it.  This opinion applied to both the whiting and the catfish.
The fried okra was the perfect combination of batter and okra.  I was able to easily break it apart and see the okra which was well cooked and none of the slimy was evident from the okra itself.
Another thing to note is the 2-piece plate does come with 3 pieces of shrimp (fried) which was very tasty and delicious, and a drink.  

Despite never had whiting and catfish in my life, I have to say that I'm now hooked on it and since I left, I've been craving on returning to this restaurant to have more!"}
{"text":"I had the catfish and okra it was cooked to perfection light crisp batter, My wife had the cod and french fries it was also cooked perfect not greasy and not a heavy batter we had the two piece fish which also came with 3 shrimp 
we will be back"}
{"text":"I will try catfish and southern food where ever I can find it and I had a Livingsocial for this place so even though it was out of my way I decided to try it. I don't like spicy anything but I have to say that I also thought this was the best catfish I've had. So much so that I had to go back and make sure I didn't think it was so good only because I was hungry. It was just as good the second time. This time I decided to try some of the sides. The mac and cheese was just okay, I've had better. The greens were just too bitter for me. I couldn't finish them. But I will definitely be back for catfish and try the BBQ next time. Very friendly people working there."}
{"text":"Good food for the soul! The catfish was cooked just right. You must try the peach cobbler! I could have eaten a whole pie."}
{"text":"OMG, this place is a \"Hole in the wall\"but the food is BOMB and prices are reasonable.  The catfish was very good seasoned well and peach cobbler(great)collard greens,mac n cheese,fried okra was great and the older gentlemen was very nice.  I order more food weekly...GREAT JOB PJ fish n que."}
{"text":"I bought like 60 dollars worth of catfish for my moms Birthday and it fed a party of 20 with left overs! On top of that it was some of the best fried catfish ive ever eaten from a restaurant!"}
{"text":"I ordered fish and chips with a side of shrimp. The cat fish was cooked amazing! The food was delicious, not greasy at all and I even liked the fries.
The shrimp was also perfectly cooked too. Definitely a place to stop by and enjoy the food. Thanks yelpers for letting me know about this place!"}
{"text":"I went here a couple days ago with my roommate cuz we saw the great reviews on here and we live just down the street. Good idea. for just over $10 I got the burger combo and he got a cheeseburger. We could tell that the burgers were made fresh to order not frozen and thrown on a grill or re-heated. It was a nice big burger, and was delicious with lettuce, tomato, and would be onion except that he's allergic. And pickles. Ketchup and mustard plus they had bottles of ketchup that you could add if you so desired. My combo came with two sides and a drink, which they had a soda fountain as well as a lemonade fruit punch and grape kool-aid option. I chose potato salad and sweet potato tater-tots. the potato salad was in a separate bowl and was good. The sweet potato tater tots on the other and blew me away. they were simply amazing. there was a lot of them as well. Totally worth the $10. Prolly be back more often."}
{"text":"I found this place on Yelp after looking at its high reviews and went for dinner last week. It's located in a sort of run down strip,shopping center. After walking in I noticed it is a counter service only restaurant that centers on seafood and BBQ but the menu has more seafood items than BBQ. Because of that I decided on fried fish and ordered the whiting which came with one side and I chose fried okra. I then decided to also try their baked beans as another side that I paid extra for. 

The food arrived about 15 minutes later. The whiting was excellent! The flavor along with being fried properly allowed me to really enjoy that fish (4.5). The fried okra was good and I rated them at (3.5). The beans were ok and I gave them a 3. 

The owner was taking orders at the cashier stand and was very friendly. This is a place you come to that is laid back and casual for a good meal. While there I got the impression it is a popular neighborhood spot which is good. I wish I could have tried some of their Q but the whiting really was excellent!"}
{"text":"Amazing food! My buddy from Kansas City and I were starving and he was craving a taste of home. Found this on here and had amazing reviews. There was a place much closer to me but this place looked much more authentic and the food looked real and not dolled up or overstated. 

Got there and the atmosphere was amazing. Small joint in a strip mall next to a quaint grocery store and barber shop, right off historic Bethany Home Road. Very nice people behind the counter and seemed like a down home family establishment. 

The lady behind the counter was very helpful in my decision to get the spiced cod and my buddy insisted I got the fried Okra (my first time). And I HAD to get the corn bread!

The food came and it looked like it was prepared with love and carefully placed on the plate. Everything was amazing! My buddy got the catfish and he thought it was amazing as well. And the hot sauce is to die for!

Would recommend, 10/10. I will be back"}
{"text":"Love the fish and service here!!! It reminds of back at home. The menu is great and reasonable portions are right."}
{"text":"Wow, I totally would not have come here if it weren't for Yelp. My dentist is right across the street and my appt. ended right around dinner time so we decided to come here. 

My fiance got the wings and onion rings, I got the catfish with shrimp and fried okra, and we got a peach cobbler and sweet potato pie to go. Everything was good, and not too heavy or greasy. I wasn't a fan of the peach cobbler, I wonder if they used canned peaches bc something didn't taste right, can't pin point what. Sweet potato pie was good though! 

Owner is friendly, lot of locals seem to frequent this place and it looks like he is on a first name basis with them; always a good sign.

Can't wait to return and try more items off their menu!"}
{"text":"Our experience here was Great !!! Really enjoyed the Spicy Catfish, Mac n cheese, Greens, cornbread and Peach cobbler. Will say this is our fave place to eat Soul Food !!!"}
{"text":"Love, love, love Papa Joe's Fish-N-Que! My husband and I get dinner here at least twice a month. Cod, Catfish, Shrimp, Okra, Cornbread, Jalapeno Hushpuppies, our favorites!!! Best fried fish in Phoenix! Give them a try, you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"MY TIP: \"We ordered the spicy catfish and the regular whiting...OMG the whiting!!!\"

Found this place on Yelp, surprised we hadn't seen it earlier, and wanted something different. We felt like having seafood but really don't like the overpriced chain seafood restaurants (Red Lobster, Pappadeaux's) that are never as good as they show or charge. 

Anyway, found this place and it had great reviews - must be good. And yeah, not disappointed. We usually order directly from Yelp photos, so we really already knew what we wanted but were surprised at how much was on the menu. 

One Catfish combo  (Joe recommend spicy) and a Whiting combo (regular batter). We got various sides to share and try. I would have to say, I wasn't impressed by the sides, but they were good. Just your good ol' average comfort-food sides, but the real star was the battered fish. I love catfish - so I always order it, but I wasn't as in love this time. It was good, didn't have as much flavor for me, so maybe I will try the regular batter next time. But the whiting - I would order that again. I don't know if it was the batter or what, tasted almost like lemon pepper, that was delish! Portions were plenty - I was kind of happy my boyfriend couldn't eat all of his and I finished his Whiting (oink oink). 

Overall we enjoyed our meal and we will definitely be back. The restaurant was comfortable, overall pretty clean, wasn't too crowded, there was a TV with Family Feud playing so we were all guessing along, and service was decent. 

That's what I have to say about it."}
{"text":"First time here, ordered food to go. Place is a family owned business located at the end of a strip mall. Early Saturday afternoon and it was still busy. Main choices are BBQ or Fried Fish. There are many options and sides. Opted for the pulled brisket combination with jalopeno hush puppies and cole slaw with a fountain drink.

The pulled brisket was very good, served on a hambuger bun. You can add their BBQ sauce or hot sauce and again there are options. The brisket was flavorful and juicy and a very generous portion. I would order that again any day. BBQ sauce that we tried had a vinegar base 

Not too impresed with the jalopeno hush puppes. Small size nuggets but not spicy for my taste. Searched but could not find the jalopeno. The cole slaw was good, it had a mayo base. 

Will be back to try the fried catfish with greens and okra. You can call in your order and take it home or dine in. A filling and flavorful lunch."}
{"text":"I have been there a couple of times, the food is always very good and lots of it.  I like the two piece cod lunch that includes three shrimp and fries.   Well worth a drive to get there. They also have the normal hamburgers ribs and links.   Give it a try."}
{"text":"Unfortunately the last few times I've been here the service is so ridiculously slow it's not worth coming to anymore. Today I ordered two ribs and after 25 minutes of waiting I could not wait anymore so I had to leave. You guys should learn how to expedite orders especially on simple simple things 2 ribs. Come on guys"}
{"text":"I've come  to notice that the places with the best god are the little hole in the wall spots. My biz partner and I lucked up when we yelped this place to eat before we hit the road for a 6 hr trip. As soon as we walked in a older, heavy set African American man was sitting behind the counter. He appeared to be chewing something in his mouth and had that cliche southern style look. I loved it, we ordered the catfish and cod with fried shrimp on side. I must say they were delicious. Good service with good food always speaks volumes in my book.  I'm not sure if the fried fish cooked by African American people was so good because they're great cold or because I'm biased because it's Black history month. Never the less, two thumbs up."}
{"text":"Great place, kinda a hole in the wall. Got the fried catfish, came with a couple shrimp, and mac n cheese...all was very good.  They do things right here. You can tell when you walk in the door because they are selling plenty of seafood and they are frying most of their menu but you do not smell fish and you do not smell oil. I thought it was a bit pricey at first but definitely worth the money for what you get. Well done!"}
{"text":"Food is good. Only complaint is that their menu board is wrong. It says that you get two sides with the combos, but you only get one.

And service is VERY slow."}
{"text":"I thought the last place I went to was the worst. Nope! If you came here for the barbecue and gave this place anything above a one then it is clear to me that you have never made it out of the hood to get good barbecue. The absolute worst ribs I've ever eaten in my entire life. Zero smoke flavor, zero spices, wayyyy too much salt.  Additionally, it is clear that the ribs were cooked at least 24 hours or more ago."}
{"text":"I came here on a whim and boy I am happy I did. I tried half and half spicy and regular catfish nuggets. The seasoning was perfect, the outside was nice and crunchy while the inside was super tender. Could definitely tell it was fresh, and would definitely recommend it to all of my friends."}
{"text":"Friendly service, great food cooked to order. Absolutely loved the fried catfish, the hush puppies, and the fried okra. There's a fried theme here. But we also enjoyed the bbq brisket sandwich. There is a great vibe here, and we'd revisit in a hot second. Quick and delicious."}
{"text":"Fresh fish and great prices. Had the catfish and onion rings, both amazing.

The service was quick and you can tell it is a family owned restaurant, very polite."}
{"text":"Love love love their catfish!! Mac n cheese is terrible as is their cornbread muffin. The wait time needs improvement so call ahead if you can. The place is clean and never crowded, but the staff always seems busy. Sometimes This is my go-to during the week when I can't make dinner and need to pick something up on the way home. But it sometimes also involves me stopping some place else for a side dish. Still gonna order that catfish though!! Sooooo good!"}
