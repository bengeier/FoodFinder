{"text":"okay, so you should go to the jade garden if you like buffets. its also good if you like vegetables, not because there is a stunning variety of meatless items, but because the green beans they make are SO good. also the broccoli in the chicken and broccoli is really good. there's probably a lot of garlic in there.   usually when i go to the jade garden, i try to balance out the amount of fried stuff on my plate with green stuff. so in addition to the broccoli and green beans, i like an egg roll, some scallion pancakes, and maybe some noodles.  there's definitely that token dessert counter, complete with the funny pudding with nilla wafers or bananas, green jello squares, some kind of cookies, little pieces of cake that remind of of gelatin for some reason, and tapioca. i would skip this area altogether if i were you. end on a savory note. grab an extra scallion pancake. its worth it."}
{"text":"Pretty typical generic Chinese restaurant.  Egg rolls were just fine as were rangoons.  The beef fried rice had a weird gummy, slimy texture, which is not typical.  The mandarin pan-fried noodles special dish was good.  The biggest complaint was with that was supposed to \"twice-cooked pork\", which it was in name only.  This dish should be thinly sliced, fatty pork belly, cooked crispy in a spicy sauce.  What they actually serve as this dish is hunks of pork loin meat in a slightly spicy sauce.  They got the correct animal, but that is about all."}
{"text":"Freaking delicious and cheap every time. Been living here 4 years and I've stopped looking at other places to get Chinese food."}
{"text":"Sweet and sour chicken was good amd it was a very good sized portion. However DO NOT get the the Kung Pao Chicken, when I opened the box it smelled like urine. I'm not exaggerating. There are much better places to order Chinese food from Madison."}
{"text":"I ordered here frequently until I got violently ill from my last order. I always got chicken and broccoli and the last time I ordered I got sick for a few days. Not just upset stomach but fever and other symptoms I'm not going in to detail. DO NOT EAT HERE"}
{"text":"I've ordered Jade Garden a couple of times and have received very inconsistent food.  This time (which will be my last), I received 2 disgusting egg rolls (the oil clearly hadn't been changed in days) and the kung pao chicken smelled like dog piss AND was littered with massive green peppers which smelled rancid.. Sadly, I wasted $7 on it because it had to go in the trash bin.  The chicken fried rice & lo mein was pretty tasty, but definitely greasy.  I will never order from there again."}
{"text":"Went here bc my boyfriend likes Chinese buffets. Could barely concentrate on the food bc, as another reviewer put it, this place smelled like a basement. There is a small room off to the side of the main dining area where I could noticeably see a mop and bucket in full view. Not very fun to look at cleaning supplies while I'm eating. Also, the place was unbelievably humid, no fresh air whatsoever. Who knows, maybe the food wasn't half bad, but the environment kept me from enjoying anything. Would not recommend."}
{"text":"Typical Chinese buffet.  Good service.  Come right when lunch or dinner starts and it is super fresh.  They will restock anything you ask for.  They should have Jimmy John's commercial cuz their delivery is crazy fast."}
{"text":"I went here for lunch around 3pm on a Friday. This place is horrible. The majority of items were gone and not quickly replenished, if at all. For example, the sweet and sour sauce was in a pan to a depth of about 1/8 inch and was completely gelatinous due to old age. In fact, most of the food that tasted as though it was probably yesterday's leftovers- dehydrated and chewy. About half of all dishes remained empty the entire time I was there. As for taste, everything was swimming in an excess of oil (even for a Chinese buffet).   The crab rangoons were sweeter than usual and I did not see any crab in them- definitely not the best I've ever had.  The desert selection was pathetic.  I will not be going again."}
{"text":"I have driven past Jade Garden many many times in the past and because it has no curb appeal and Chinese buffets can be questionable I never ate there. However, some coworkers of mine recommended it and I was pleasantly surprised. We had been stuck in a long meeting and were very hungry by the time we got there. Thankfully they have a buffet so there is no need to wait for your food. Their hot and sour soup was really good. Also had the Lo Mein Fun, Kung Pao, Eggroll, Green Beans, Mushroom and Crab Rangoon. All of it was really good. And yes the Crab Rangoon is the best in Madison as other reviews state. The food is affordable and the lunch buffet price even includes soda. I will be back."}
{"text":"The food is pretty good. Crab rangoon and chicken strips are excellent. Also, I love the peanut butter chicken. I've never been to the buffet, but it is really cheap.  I would say it's better than Asian Kitchen, A8 China, or QQ Express, but not quite as good as Ichiban or Orient House. It's also cheaper though, and the last two are not really on the same 'crappy americanized asian food' level.  My biggest annoyance, though, and hence the two stars, is the huge a-hole of a delivery driver they have. I order from there once or twice a month, and it's always this old Asian guy with stained teeth.. but that's not why.  He always asks for more tip, even though they already charge for delivery and I give him tip when I order online with my card. The delivery fee and tip already add up to more than 15% of my bill; what else do you want?! You expect to get more tips than waiters who attend to your whole meal?? He asks every. single. time. without fail. In fact, I don't know why I even still order delivery from them.  Maybe it's the crab rangoon dipped in the sweet sauce. Or the peanut butter sauce that so sweet and tasty it precipitates grains of sugar when it gets cold. Mmm. 4 stars if they get rid of that delivery guy... or teach him some manners."}
{"text":"Great spot. This place has a great vibe, and good food. I like coming here whenever I need to eat lots of crab rangoons, which is often. I always have a good one when I come here. And I always leave happy."}
{"text":"After living nearby for 3 years or so and having both the buffet and take-out options many times, I now do not think it is so awesome as I initially thought. The quality is hit or miss. Sometimes you get old vegetables and it's pretty apparent. They do not deshell/tail/legs the shrimp for many of their dishes (particularly the deep fried ones, like sweet and sour shrimp or butter shrimp) so watch out for that if you order shrimp. Their menu is big, but not all of it is good, so ordering something I've never tried before can be disappointing. I have found some things that are consistently decent and I stick to them.  It's no destination spot for Chinese food (I'd point you to Ichiban Szechuan Restaurant for that), but I think it's better than places on campus like A8 China, it's close to my house so I don't have to have it delivered, and it gets the job done (when it's good)."}
{"text":"I have never seen Peanut Butter Chicken on a menu before.  It is my absolute favorite!  They are clean, quick, and their food is amazing.  I always judge a Chinese restaurant by their sesame chicken, and it is amazing here too.  I will always suggest this place, and I have introduced my friends to their Peanut Butter Chicken, and they love it!!!"}
{"text":"There is nothing particularly stunning or revolting about Jade Garden: it is what it is.  I ordered from here all the time in college - cheap food, specials every so often if you Google it, pretty quick turnaround as well.  I was back in Madison for New Year's, and I ordered from here on New Year's Day, online.  Not only were they open (unlike some of their delivery friends), but they had it at my door in about 15 minutes.  I don't know if I'm scared or impressed, but I'm going to go with impressed.  Food is traditional blah pan-Asian cuisine, but I did enjoy the fried potstickers, fried wontons, and eggrolls.  Then again, anything fried is soooo gooooood.  Chicken with broccoli was decent - broccoli wasn't soggy, and it was aplenty.  Better Chinese food than most places in Madison, with great delivery times to boot.  Someday, Jade Garden, I will be back."}
{"text":"****MAJOR POINT OF IMPORTANCE FOR THIS REVIEW**** The Crab Rangoon is the best I've ever tasted (ohh and I've tasted plenty)!!!!  Was a college staple when I attended the great UW-Madison now I can just dream of the great food I was able to eat.  Only had maybe 2 bad experiences out of over 100 so I guess thats a pretty success rate.  I have really only eaten in Jade Garden for the buffet 5 times or so.  I'm usually a delivery customer.  Whenever I am in Madison for a football game or whenever else, I try to make it a point to order from the Jade.  I personally love the General Tso's and the Chicken Lo Mein, Brianna W has had the Broccoli Chicken and she loves it.  Also, no matter what you order or when, they will always say it takes 45 mins.  They are also somewhat difficult to understand on the phone which can get frustrating but is somewhat fun."}
{"text":"Comparatively, this was a mid-to-lower end Chinese Buffet thus the 3 stars.  The Positives   --The Crispy fish was good enough that I went back for seconds.  --The dumplings were really good. I wasn't sure what exactly were in them due to a lack of signage about ingredients. --The Sweet and sour chicken was very good and it was unexpectedly flavorful. I generally expect SS chicken to taste of grease but that was not the case here. --The Mei Fun was very good in terms of rich flavor. --Decent service (I was offered a soda refill twice in my hour there) --You will leave full for a good price  The Negatives   --No MTO options available as they are in some higher end Chinese Buffets. --Lack of signage: No signs on desert bar... some of the deserts were unclear. There were no ingredients listings on any of the items in the buffet. This could be problematic in figuring out potential allergies.  --Salad bar issues: It was underwhelming in that it did not offer Caesar dressing. The lettuce had brown spots as well. There was also some gross, cross-contamination going on with the salad bar. For example, I opted not to use the ranch due to some red sauce dripping into it. Alot of other things had extraneous foods or sauces in them. I felt like this was negligence in making sure that the buffet area was presentable.  --Alot of the buffet items were running low, on their last scoop, like they had been just cooking away. It seemed like they were slow to replace items that were running low.  --The Vegetable Lo Mein was a bit bland --The Peanut Butter chicken would have been better had it been hotter. This item was not as fresh as I would have liked.  All in all, I would come back here if I wanted to grab a quick bite in the area. If I want the best a Chinese Buffet can offer, I'd however be looking else where."}
{"text":"Gross! Hand down the worst General Tso's Chicken I've ever had.  Small, soggy egg roll. Soggy chicken that smelled like dog food. And, what was most insulting was the \"fried rice\" was just an ice cream scoop of steamed rice with something brown squirted on top.  Never again, Jade Garden."}
{"text":"Good cheap Chinese buffet. The spiced potatoes are amazing, and the crab rangoons are really good too."}
{"text":"Ok.  I've been to several Chinese buffets.  With that said, this place should be shut down.  The food and selection is icky and poor ( is this even a word?!).  It's great... if you're famished... and the rest of Madison's restaurants are closed.    Yes, best crab rangoon in town.  Also, the best chocolate pudding anyone can find outside of a grocery store.  $6.25 a person, though.  Not shabby."}
{"text":"When I ordered Jade Garden rather hungover on a Sunday, I expected to get greasy Chinese-American food. And that's exactly what I got. Jade Garden will happily fill your Chinese food cravings, and keep you on budget! Not to mention delivery was very fast. Only complaint was my Crab Rangoon were a little cold, but everything else was nice and hot.  I was not impressed with the Crab Rangoon (cold or not). There just wasn't a lot of flavor. I did enjoy the Scallion pancakes however, as well as the Sweet and Sour Chicken. Crispy Chicken plus Sweet and Sour sauce equals happy Kelsi.   Next time I hop on the struggle bus I'll be sure to remember this place."}
{"text":"Kindly staff, quite good crab rangoon, but the entrees were bland as can be. We ordered delivery and got chicken with garlic sauce and szechuan chicken. We could hardly tell the difference in flavor between the two. Maybe they were having a bad day?  The pot stickers/fried dumplings were acceptable. Not as gross as some places can be but not very exciting either. Their crab rangoon was pretty good though! I wish they'd bump up their taste. I can't find a good Chinese place in madison."}
{"text":"Hunan Beef: Overloaded with average-quality vegetables...there was hardly any meat to speak of in this dish. I don't appreciate that. You're clearly trying to rip me off for the cost of the most expensive ingredient and it just reflects poorly on yourself. In addition it was really spicy without having any actual flavor to it - kind of like when you dump tabasco on something bland.   Crab Rangoons: Delicious, crunchy and sweet wontons with an excellent sauce to complement it. Mouth waters just thinking about them.  Veggie Egg Rolls: Excellent, crispy both inside and out...Not soggy at all. Not even that greasy for a deep fried food. Goes great with any and every kind of dipping sauce, plus they're cheap and plentiful."}
{"text":"I'm a regular at this place ( the the point that the staff knows what I want to drink) but I have to admit that it isn't the best place in the world: The cooking staff have been going through the motions for years and it shows, and if you're not there twenty minutes after it opens the buffet is going to be pretty severely picked over and congealed. That being said, the service is quick and the prices are reasonable. If you're not one of those food snobs that obsesses over the 'nuances' in your food, JG is a good place for a quick lunch or dinner before heading out for the evening..."}
{"text":"This is a typical Americanized Chinese restaurant. They have a decently price lunch buffet with a good selection. You'll find all the standard breaded meats with familiar sauces such as sweet and sour, hoisin, etc...  You'll find better in Madison but at least they deliver."}
{"text":"I like ordering from jade garden.  It's cheap, it's fast, it's open late, and they peanut chicken.... having said that it is by no means high end chinese and there  buffet, though well priced was unwhelming both in offering and food quality.   Having said that... I'll likely be back.  It's cheap and they have peanut chicken."}
{"text":"While in Madison and working with locals, I kept hearing about how Jade Garden had THE BEST EVAAARR Chinese food in Madison.  My experiences with Madison Chinese food consisted of A8, Asian Kitchen, and, dare I mention it, the Yummy.  Of these, I concur, Jade Garden had the best Chinese to offer.  What a pathetic statement that is.  Now, it is very, very good, don't get me wrong. And I highly enjoyed it. I once dragged a friend with me down Park St all the way 2 blocks from the capital in January, took the bus to the restaurant and then decided to walk back in the foot-deep snow (bad decision). I digress.  Their lunch buffet is quite good, the delivery a bit pricier. But, once again, it blew away most things offered by the other three, and no need to feel like you'll die afterwards.  Still... if this is the best in Madison... another reason I'm glad I moved out."}
{"text":"If you are looking for high end Chinese food, you are not going to find it here.  But you will find a buffet that always has hot and sour soup, egg drop soup, garlicky blistered green beans, egg rolls, dumplings, chicken satay, lo mein noodles, seafood delight, chicken with broccoli, oyster mushrooms, General Tso's chicken, mixed Chinese vegetables, butter shrimp .... the list goes on.  I have been coming here for years.  The food is always the same.  The waitress is always friendly.  The place is dumpy, but if you take the time to talk to the manager, he would tell you that they are looking for a new location because all of the buildings on the block have been purchased and will be razed.  Would you invest money into a building that you are going to be forced out of soon?  Unlike the previous reviewer, my daughter loves this place, and she is a Chinese food snob.  In fact, husband and I will be going here for lunch today even though it is out of our way from our offices."}
{"text":"Not nearly as good as the one in Eau Claire (same place, I checked). But it's ok. Not my first choice for Chinese, but it's alright."}
{"text":"This is a pretty average Chinese buffet. Some of the food is quite good. I went at 1:00p on a week day and some of the buffet dishes were dried out. The staff was friendly. There cubby for the drink fountain and bus station smelled slightly moldy. It was noticeable whenever I walked by.   I would eat here again because their selection was good and the price was about $7.50 with a drink."}
{"text":"Delivery dislike.....did an online order...It's about 1.5 hours and delivery has not arrived. Food might be good, but cannot say that kind of service is worth telling my friends about. Tip has to be given online with the order,  kind of disappointed in that....now...."}
{"text":"Had delivery from Jade Garden via Grub Hub. Ordered at 7 on a Sunday and it took an hour and fifteen minutes for delivery. That being said, the portion are huge, especially for the prices, and the food is flavorful. My boyfriend enjoyed his Hunan chicken, although my chicken mei fun was a bit lacking. Quality of the meat could be better, but there were a lot of veggies in the hunan. I did enjoy the steamed buns as an app. My summary: good value for a lot of food but some dishes are better than others."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I gave Jade Garden a try before we ordered their takeout food. It was great. Not a huge buffet, but the food was hot, and yummy. We are definitely going to go back and order their takeout."}
{"text":"We went here on a saturday night, about an hour before close. I appreciated how the wait staff offered to make any dish we wanted fresh. They watched what we and other patrons were taking off the buffet and quickly made up small portions to replace. The selection is pretty good and varied."}
{"text":"This place has one thing going for it, it's busy at the noon rush so the food is constantly fresh. If it has good egg drop soup, a decent egg roll and steamed pot stickers I'm happy. This is all good here. The other dishes are all decent and they have cellophane noodles which I prefer instead of rice. They also have egg fu young which is usually pretty good but not on this day. Very salty and over cooked. In the years I have going here for the buffet it's been better than most of the places and the staff has finally started being nicer to the customers. Maybe it was a language thing but at first no one even made eye contact with you and now they do. There are lots of choices here but it's not as big as some, which is probably good. The building and booth seats are getting very run down and probably should be looked into. Water marks on the ceiling tile and broken springs and cuts on the seats are evident. All in all give it a try. Its about ten bucks for the lunch buffet. There is some confusion on the location on The Yelp page which is probably why there is no reviews for the Jade garden. It is here in Madison, not Bay Creek. The Park street address is correct."}
{"text":"For a Chinese buffet, this far exceeded all expectations my friends and I had. Usually we just hope to not get food poisoning, but we exceeded that exportation by leaps and bounds. We came after a long day at the Dels and we were famished. Dinner buffet costed 8.59 base which turned into around 11 after tax and tip. We also drank water to be safe for not paying extra but did not ask about other drinks. When we entered, the waitress greeted us nicely and we were seated quickly. The interior was nothing special, but was nicely lit. The tables and chairs seemed to be clean and well kept (no patched up chairs). There were several tables in the middle that could be combined and many booth seats around the exterior. As for the food, I will list the items I remember below which hopefully will be useful for anyone that might be craving specific items! Overall, I was really impressed with the quality of the food, from hot soup, fully cooked green beans, tender and juicy chicken, fluffy donuts, to reasonable food replacements. This buffet had quality across the board! There was quite a limitation in desserts, which would be the only reason to keep this from a 5 star review. Ice cream would hake been nice, but I think a 4 star buffet that is this cheap is hard to come by. Especially since other Chinese buffets around the area Costa several bucks more. I didn't taste their takeout, but would expect it to be satisfactory for a quick meal. If you are in the Madison area and craving a Chinese buffet, this is a highly recommended place!  Moving to the food: there were 4 sections of food stations. The food items we saw were sweet and sour chicken that was fried with dipping sauce, peanut butter chicken (crispy chicken in peanut sauce), potstickers, donuts (the typical fried balls with sugar all around it), fried fish, meatballs, bbq chicken skewers, egg drop soup, hot and sour soup, fried green beans, crab rangoons, terriyaki chicken, fried shrimp (thinly battered with shell on), butter shrimp (battered shrimp without shell, kinda salty), vegetable lo mein, fried rice, steamed rice, broccoli chicken, general Tsos chicken, butterfly shrimp (bread crumbed with tail on), seafood delight with veggies, mushrooms in oyster sauce, black pepper pork, and scallion pancakes (didn't have much scallion in it). There is also a salad bar (I didn't fancy salad so I didn't inspect it closely) and some desserts: bananas in some sauce, lime jello, cherry jello, almond cookies, and some cake that had creme inside it."}
{"text":"Struggled to find a decent Chinese food place in Madison for the last year after I moved here - until I tried Jade Garden. Love the egg drop soup,  chicken fried rice, chicken skewers, crab Rangoon, and scallion pancakes. Will definitely only order Chinese from here from now on."}
{"text":"Ordered the Egg Foo Young, the combo with pork instead of chicken. It was the worse I have ever tasted. The meat was minus and the gravy was water. Was told I would receive a free soda...NOT. May try again yet not promising!"}
{"text":"Got delivery... Looked em up on here and wasn't too impressed (3 isn't horrible) but really looking forward to trying the rangoon .  Phone etiquette was nice, delivery was fast, food was eh.  I wasn't expecting a lot, I just needed a greasy Chinese fix, which I got!!  The generals chicken was dried out and bland... the egg rolls were soggy but the rangoons?  Those were the WORST thing I may have ever eaten!!  I was crushed.   I thought for sure I was safe with those... but no, I did not get to enjoy the deliciousness of a previous reviewer.  Mine were stale, with lumpy chunks of nasty cream cheese and maybe one slice of green onion per rangoon.  No Crab.  Not a thing.  It was bad enough to do such a crappy job, but then to just leave out the one possible saving grace?  Horrible.  Such a disappointment :("}
{"text":"I'll start off right away by saying, if you're looking for high quality over the top great Chinese food.... this is not the place.   But why 4 stars then... full disclosure, I've been going here for years, and simply put, it's cheap dive'y Chinese food.     The quality of meat they buy isn't the highest, but it's good.   Their service is good, the building itself could use a little love.  However, at $7 for a buffet, and only $.75 for a soda.   It makes up for the average quality of food.  Would I recommend it, depends on what you are looking for.  If it's cheap good quality these this is a regular location for me.   In fact I think I'm the Duke... :-)"}
{"text":"This was my first ever Chinese buffet. I have an aversion to buffets, but after hearing how much my fiancé loves this place, I decided to step out of my comfort zone.  My first impression wasn't the best, as it kind of smells like a basement in there. Nothing was really in disrepair, just old.  We arrived a little before 8pm so there were only a couple other diners in the entire restaurant.  The food I tried, I liked. I do wish that the food was a little more fresh, though.  I realize at 8 pm, the stuff has probably been sitting around a while so maybe that was our fault.. But the fried bread I had been looking forward to was rock hard.  I asked our server for fresh fried bread and did accommodate my request, so bonus points for that.  My favorites were chicken with broccoli, sweet and sour chicken, teriyaki chicken, and the bread once it was fresh.  Definitely worthy of a repeat, although I think next time we will plan for a busier time so that there will hopefully be fresher buffet items."}
{"text":"I love Jade Garden! I have been a regular, stopping in about once a month or so for about  3 years. Coming here is basically a tradition for my Grandma and myself. They are very good about keeping their offerings fresh and rotated, unlike the revolting \"Yes Buffet\" on Fish Hatch. Family owned and operated, meaning they recognize their regulars and treat them like family!!! They only have meat egg rolls in the buffet, so every time i come in they automatically bring out some veggie ones at no extra charge, since I am a regular and a proud vegetarian. GO JADE GO!!!!!"}
{"text":"This place is a cheap Chinese buffet located in not the best of areas. We went for a late dinner and most items on the buffet tasted as though they had been under the warming lights for quite some time. This is not a place I would visit again as there are many other options out there and nothing was what I would call good that I tried.   Perhaps the delivery option would yield fresh made food that had better flavor than what I experienced."}
{"text":"Writing this after giving up after about five bites of my entree last night. I had ordered Jade Garden this past Christmas and had a decent experience - it took over an hour for the food to arrive, but seeing as they were one of like, three places open and delivering on Christmas Day I didn't mind. The food was hot and the portions generous. I had gotten sesame chicken and it was breaded white meat chunks glazed with a sweet sauce and a couple sesame seeds sprinkled on top. It was a little bland and the flavor generic (if you'd blindfolded me I wouldn't have a clue it was sesame), but it wasn't terrible. It fit the bill of cheap Chinese takeout.   Wanting something that would feed me for a couple of meals I repeated my order along with an order of veggie egg rolls to meet the delivery minimum. The egg rolls were good - crispy, crunchy fried deliciousness with a bit of a peppery bite to cut through the grease and cabbage. The sesame chicken, however, was a huge disappointment. This time instead of chunks of white meat chicken it was large pieces of breaded dark meat. I had to saw to cut through the pieces and each bite took forever to chew. The meat was pretty fatty and I just didn't care for the flavor with the sauce. After a few bites I started to feel nauseated from fighting through the texture and gave up.   The menu doesn't specify if it's supposed to be white or dark meat chicken, so I don't know which order is the norm.   I'd consider ordering again but I'd probably place my order over the phone so I can verify exactly what I'm getting - I won't deny I'm a picky eater so I'd rather not roll the dice on getting another dish of fatty meat."}
{"text":"Food is good but delivery always takes forever. Usually 90 minutes which is ridiculous. With kids it's a problem!"}
{"text":"Not to bad of a selection. Most of it seemed pretty fresh. Was a little disappointed with a few of my favorite items that seemed to be out for awhile. Banana dish was nothing but extremely bruised bananas and did not look appealing at all. Standard Chinese restaurant nothing jumps out as amazing."}
{"text":"Food was ok, but useless for delivery. I tipped 20% in advance and then the delivery guy basically refused to budge past the front door. I had to come downstairs with an injured knee to get my food, which left me super annoyed with the service and wishing I could take back the tip."}
{"text":"Don't waste your time or money here. The only reason I'm giving a star is because of the fresh scallion pancakes that were the only good thing on the line and the friendly waitress. Other than that...  the food was cold and tasted like it had been sitting on the line all day. My son, who LOVES all things buffet, was disgusted. Make your own food instead of coming here."}
{"text":"This place serves a clear purpose: it's a quick and cheap Chinese buffet. You have to walk in there with that mindset.   It's definitely not authentic Chinese, it's definitely a less-fresh buffet style, but it's also really great when you have hankerings for general, Chinese-American tastes. There's sweet and sour chicken, general tsos, beef and broccoli, little desserts, fruit and salad, soup, and so on.   I feel like if they paid a little attention to the way they look as a restaurant, they'd be taken more seriously as a buffet. We all eat with our eyes, so if their booths and walls and floors were redone, it would help immensely.   Overall, I've had zero stomachaches from eating here many many times, and I love a good $7.50 lunch buffet. Give these guys a shot, if only for the sampling of random dishes."}
{"text":"I've always bought my food as takeaway so take from it what you may.  I don't regret that joke and neither do I regret my choices. I've ordered their steamed dumplings and for the life of me, I get full of them. They're with food and I've shared a few of them. My coworkers who have eaten them have agreed they were the best dumplings they've had. Now on to the main courses.  In the past I've gotten their Chicken Curry Combo as well as their Shrimp with Lobster sauce. I'm going to be honest, I'm like the chicken curry combo more than Shrimp with Lobster. And I think that has to do with the water chestnuts that were in my dish. I read the menu but I assumed (horrible, I know) that they would be like other places and skimp on Water chestnuts. My plate was loaded with shrimp and baby corn, other veggies and those damn water chestnuts. And I look back at my chicken Curry combo and again, they had it packed with veggies and chicken.       IF you are looking for a place that loads your entrée with veggies and meat, then this is the place."}
{"text":"Jade Garden (1109 S. Park Street, Madison, WI) is an excellent Chinese buffet and take out restaurant.  If you like Chinese food this is the place to go.  The food is always fresh and we'll presented.  The hot food is always hot without being dry or overcooked unlike other buffets that keep the food hot by turning up the burners and drying out the food.  The selection of Chinese food is impressive and very tasty.  The restaurant is very clean with excellent lighting and a good number of booths and tables to select from.  The staff are very friendly and are very attentive to customer needs.  Family operated.   The price is fantastic with lunch at $8.25 and $9.55 dinner.  Prices include hot tea but other beverages are extra.  Sodas are $.95 cans and endless glass are $1.50.  Try this place and you will be a regular.  ENJOY!"}
{"text":"Arrived at 8pm and the buffet was literally bare. The owner graciously said he would cook us anything we like. However when we ask for anything, it felt like we're obliging him and he made just enough for 1 person. As other customers entered the restaurant, the minuscule amount of food disappeared quickly unless specifically asked for to replenish, Had we wished to wait for our Chinese meal to be cooked, we could have gone to a traditional Chinese restaurant. We even asked for fresh tea as the tea served was stale and super dark for sitting all day, we were told that was all they have. Even the dessert offerings was stale. This place is a poor choice, do not recommend."}
{"text":"I also love Jade Garden's Crab Rangoon.  I consider crab rangoon to be one of my favorite foods, but it has to be *just so*, and Jade does it RIGHT."}
{"text":"GROSS. undercooked chicken, slow delivery, no flavor. would not recommend this to anyone"}
{"text":"Classic Chinese-American restaurant food with buffet. I'm pretty sure that Jade Garden has the closest downtown Chinese buffet.  You'll find all the staples on the menu and buffet--fried chicken pieces with red sweet and sour sauce, crab rangoon, General Tso's chicken, etc.  I can't say the food is outstanding--pretty much the same as many other places in Madison--but I give them props for their buffet.  For delivery/takeout, their portions are larger than many other Chinese places and I like the fact that my chicken & veggies comes in a plastic container, not a flimsy takeout box. they also offer all day $5 or so specials with fried rice, rangoon, and a main dish"}
{"text":"Uuuugggh. The reviews for this place aren't horrible, so I thought I'd take a chance. I have a few regrets. It wasn't the worst, but not really very good, either. Don't get me wrong, I was aware that I was going to a Chinese buffet--they have reputations, I know. But I have been to good Chinese buffets.  This was not one."}
