{"text":"A very nice place to take the little one.. A great place to just let them have a little fun, while mommy gets to relax a bit while she watches. Friendly staff, and extremely clean. Plus, Cafe has a lot of choices on what to eat just in case you're hungry."}
{"text":"Went today for the first time. I liked that the food was  really appetizing and healthy. I liked that they supported Hattie's cafe. I do agree that menu monitor was way to hard to read. The kids area was nice. The cost was a bit pricey, but was nice to do something different. I thought it confusing that they put bracelets on parents and kids as we went in as a protection, but as we left we walked out the side exit without anyone checking. I felt like, what was the point?"}
{"text":"We visited with our 14 month old today and he had a blast! The staff was attentive and friendly, coffee was good and a long nap followed after all the excitement. Although it was a heck of a drive for us coming from Lorain County, we will definitely visit again."}
{"text":"Where to begin!? This was a great stop for a playdate with friends from out of town. My daughter, 2 at the time, had no problems with the climbing, running or activities they offered. She loved it so much so we decided to throw her 3rd birthday party here with some of her friends. The party was great. They did everything for us. Healthy food, fruit and birthday chaperones to guide the kids to each activity we selected. They have a dance party room, the giant climbing gym w/ slides, ball area, video area, arts and crafts room, and a small kid area. It was on a Saturday so it got crowded fast but glad we celebrated early so that the kids were worn out by the time we left. 

Caveat: if your child is 12-18 mos they may need more supervision and interaction as a parent than a 2-3 year old just because it does get crowded and a little rowdy. (Not in a bad way but more of a Saturday winter get the kids out of the house burn off energy.) And despite having staff monitors watching children, it's still on the parents to make sure their kids don't get hurt. (We witnessed a little girl crying b/c she hurt her hand and managed to get her to her parents.) 

I don't think there's a cleaner place for kids to go to. So clean that the scent of bleach burned my nostrils as I left the restroom. :)"}
{"text":"I found another awesome place to take my son to in hopes he would burn off some tot energy and possibly have his 3rd birthday party at.  

I've visited this place before to inquire about having his 2nd birthday there but he never went there to play. I would say that it is a great place. It had a lot of different things for him to do and he zipped through them all. There was a block building station for 4 years or younger. There was an \"open gym\" area where he could play basketball, soccer, play with animal pads and a few other things. They had an interactive floor that had games for him to play and he absolutely loved that. The meat of the place is a huge jungle gym that featured about 4 slides and tons of obstacles for him to climb on and enter in from all over the place. 

They also had a dodge ball enclosed circle and a glow dance party room. He didn't play in there much or participate in the Olympics but he ultimately had a ball.

We sampled the pizza as that's the main dish if his party were to be hosted there and we were not impressed. The dough was pretty thick and lacked an efficient amount of pepperoni's. It kind of tasted like a cheap pizza from Wal-Mart. We initially ordered a lemonade and ended up switching it to another drink due to the lack of sweetness... and that ultimately turned my husband off regarding having his party there...especially for $419.

Lastly, the admission is $12. A bit over priced to me so it wont be a frequent place that I take him but overall it's a great place for him to play!"}
{"text":"I'm always open to checking out new places for my kids to play and this place is great for younger kids. It's a great set up for keeping an eye on kids while being able to sit near by. The place seems well maintained and clean considering the amount of children running around. The food was good with many options and prices typical of a similar style cafe. The staff was very friendly and came around to check on guests making sure everything was ok. My two year old loved the Disney song along. I would definitely return."}
{"text":"Great new place for wearing down the kids.   Basically an indoor playground/cafe.  Couple suggestions - the welcoming podium should be right inside the door (where a trash can is now), needs another monitor for the menu (way to much makes it way to hard to read), need a shoe rack for shoes (dodging piles of shoes everywhere in the play area is really unnecessary).  Prices are a bit high.  Overall a great place.  We will return."}
{"text":"My kids like it here... It can get really crowded.  There is not enough parent seating.  Good for ages 3 and up.  I had to stay by my 18 month old the whole time, there are lots of unsupervised bigger kids running around playing rough, throwing things (when I was there this was happening in the toddler area).  I think staff walking/ supervising the play area would be a huge help."}
{"text":"My kids (5 and 2) had an absolute blast!  We got there right when it opened and had the place to ourselves for about 45 min.  While being a little smaller than some of the indoor playgrounds we have been to, this place has a few different zones: jungle gym, ball/sports area, dance party room, giant floor video game, and toddler play area. The bonus for me was the upgraded cafe with real food and drink options so we didn't have to eat cheap carnival food again like most kid places have.  And this has to be the cleanest kid place that I have ever seen.  I hope they are able to keep that up."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. I was really on the fence about giving 4 or 5 stars. I wish I could have given 4.75 stars. My daughters (4yrs and 6yrs old)  love this place. It's immaculately clean and although it is on the smaller size, they have things split up nicely and the areas aren't cramped. I will say it is on the pricey side. For two kids I paid over $20 just for them to play - I ended up buying some juice. Ohh I will say I love that they have healthier options for beverages and snacks. This is a GREAT place for kids to play. I would recommend to all of my friends with children. I will be returning, but on their ''Multiples Night\" (where you buy one entry and get one free for families with more then one child)."}
{"text":"My 8 and 4 year old grandsons absolutely love this place! It's great to have something to do for the young ones during the winter. The place is very clean and the staff is friendly and helpful. My only complaint is that the staff needs to supervise the dining area better. We were there on MLK day and we saw people put coats and bags on tables and then walk away. It left everyone else not knowing if the table was taken or not.  Also people didn't clean up after themselves and that was confusing too, not to mention thoughtless. But this is a great place and close to home. We are going back tomorrow!

Update, 9-3-16. \"C O'P\" has become my go-to place with my 8 and 5 year old grandsons. I was very disappointed when they decided to close on Sunday's and Mondays in summer, until November. The staff there is super nice, helpful and friendly, and even though it caters to kids, it's spotless.  The staff interacts with the kids and there is usually a staff member monitoring behavior. My only beef is with the food. It is pretty expensive, and once, the adult grilled cheese I had was half melted, processed cheese dumped into a piece of pita. Now that a play place is opening in Solon, I hope it doesn't affect Cafe O'Play too much."}
{"text":"Great place for your kids to play and meet new friends! My wife said the food is good, kind of similar to Panera. There is an area to eat and the play area. Every time we bring our daughter she goes home happy and exhausted. Highly recommend for kids that are active."}
{"text":"Cafe O'Play is basically an indoor play ground and Cafe. It's super clean, the staff is really friendly and there is stuff to do for kids of all ages! 

I took my toddler (19 months) on a play date here last night with a friend and her daughter. They both had a total blast. This is something you take your child to for more than an hour. Three hours had passed and my son was mad he had to leave LOL. He did sleep really well last night though! 

The indoor playground is awesome. They have a little obstacle course to get to the slides that is great for kids! COP also has a little dance room, ball room where the kids can play with balls and run around like crazy, a toddler area, and a ton of room to run in! The Cafe itself isn't too bad and my son really liked his muffin tin lunch. Such a cute idea! I love the variety of organic and natural items they sell as well! 

Last night they put on a talent show for the kids so they could go up to the stage and sing, crack jokes, etc. It was super adorable! 

I can't wait to take my son back!"}
{"text":"Caf√© O'Play is a great resource for parents, especially during NE Ohio's winter months.  My 4 and 2 year old's love it and it is a great way for them to burn some energy, especially when it isn't nice enough to play outside.  It is very clean and the staff is very friendly and helpful"}
{"text":"We were visiting Akron for my brother's wedding and found this  place. You are welcomed by the owner and I love the fact his kids are there as well. Clean, friendly, and our 3 year old had a ball. We will definitely go back."}
{"text":"This is a nice spot, it is kept very clean as well. I observed employees walking around, cleaning the surfaces, poles, and in general keeping up with having a clean play yard. 

It might not be super large in terms of indoor play yards are concerned. However it is a decent size and the kids seem to be overall pleased. There certainly is enough to keep your children busy for hours! 

The Cafe is a huge bonus! Let's face it, you are going to want to break away from the high octane of a million kids running around, screaming, and doing what kids do the best. So it is nice to step into the Cafe and grab a quick bite or drink. It allows your family a chance to recharge, because you know no kid is tapping out after round one, especially when they could pretty much go on for hours and hours.

Prices are fair, I over heard a few people complaining about the \"No outside\" food rules. Meh, to be expected; personally didn't care about that but word of warning if you are a \"pack your own food\" type of family.

Overall a great, clean, and fun location for your family."}
{"text":"I usually take my 19 month old daughter to another indoor play area in Avon. We live in Mentor, but visit my Mother in Law weekly. We decided to try a different place, and I'm so glad we did. Cafe o Play is the perfect size! Lots of climbing, toys and even a diso dance room with fun colorful lights. It was very clean inside and the employees were very welcoming. We had lunch during our visit at the cafe and my daughter loved hers! I enjoyed my veggie wrap and macchiato. I love that parents are allowed on the climbing structures, since my little one is afraid of going down the slide alone. We both got our workout in! We can't wait to go back. Well worth the drive from Mentor!"}
{"text":"Well, I give cafe o play 4 stars because my family has been coming here since before our daughter was able to fully walk on her own and we have had some really great times and have a lot of memories already stored. My daughter is now 2 and is really enjoying being here!

However, today was different. It's a Saturday night and I have off work and after dinner my daughter just had to come to the \"happy play place\" I thought hey! they will close in 30 min but why not? She's two and doesn't run around like the big kids and will probably spend most of her time dancing in the dance room. What I was not expecting was them to charge me $6.50 for 28 minutes of play time. A two year old to jump around in a room. There was no exceptions? I have overlooked the pricey aspect of cafe of play for 2 years yet today is different. We will continue to come and play most likely but I see this place in a different light as of today."}
{"text":"My almost 3 year old enjoyed himself. Price of $10 was a bit high, especially if you want to take more than 1 child. But it was a clean play area and he enjoyed himself. Food was ok --- I ordered a chicken salad and it was cheap, pressed and processed chicken so that was gross but the snacks they had to offer were good, I just wouldn't order a meal there again. They have a 6 muffin pan you can get 6 different foods in for your child which was a great idea!"}
{"text":"Found this place while looking for an indoor playspace during a long drive along l-80. It was perfect! Not too big, super clean. Enough to keep a 4.5 yr old and a 22 month old occupied for two hours before fill on exhaustion kicked in. So happy we came across this place."}
{"text":"Cafe o' play is a great place to take the little one's! Amazing and caring staff and plenty to do for the kid's. Also it's not just a playground they have crafts and always have activities each month. I have been coming here since they opened, first with my son and now my grandson and I am very thankful that I have a fun and safe place to bring them to have fun.

I suggest that if you have a little one that you give this a try! Oh they also have healthy lunches for you and the kid's as well!!!"}
{"text":"Love!! Yummy food. Good times and events for the family. Highly recommend. Easy place to relax and let the kids run wild."}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere here ! The staff were very nice and helpful . The cafe has all the variety of food and drinks so no worries when you are hungry or thirsty. It's so relaxing for a stay at home mom like myself, I really like it here . I'm glad my sister told me about this place because I will be taking my son here again ! He had so much fun here today that he did not want to go home ."}
{"text":"My 5 year old son loves going here. Plenty of activities to keep him busy and there are some loungers and tables for parents to sit at and sip on coffee while the kids play. 

If you go, plan on staying for a couple hours to get your money's worth. It's not super expensive but it's enough that you want to let the kids play around quite a bit before you leave. 

Also, I did have my son's 4th birthday here and I must say they did an excellent job with the party. The whole package was reasonably priced (including the pizza and veggie tray I added on) and it came with some extras like a cafe o'play shirt for my son signed by everyone that came to the party. The girl that was helping with the party was more than helpful and she went above and beyond to help with everything."}
{"text":"Man, you guys absolutely nailed it.  I sat comfortably on my laptop for 2 hours while my 7 year old daughter had the time of her life...  soooo many people tonight,  but it didn't seem chaotic.  How?  The owner was smiling while serving hundreds of germy kids and their families.  How?  Stow is blessed to have such a place!  Wish we had one where I am from."}
