{"text":"The food is great! The BBQ pork fried rice is my fav. The pork is tender and sweet. It's not salty like other Caribbean-Chinese that I've had before. The chicken balls are not greasy at all and there is a nice portion of chicken, rather than mostly batter."}
{"text":"I used to come here religiously! The food is amazing and the service is somewhat good. They could work on being more welcoming. They mostly serve Caribbean food or hakka food rather than Chinese."}
{"text":"That fried rice with chicken and pork on top is mouth-watering. Have to throw some of that hot sauce on top"}

cheap, quick, and yummy !! Just landed in Toronto, and needed a quick dinner before settling into the city. The fast food joint was only 15 minutes away from the airport, so we decided to come here. The fried chicken was super good !! not the best fried chicken I've had, but it's up there on the list. We also ordered the b.b.q pork fried rice, really flavorful and greasy. Everything we had was TOTAL YUM ! 

would definitely recommend if you love eating CHICKEN ! 
And Yes, i would come back if I lived in the area !! cheap, quick and good, what more can you ask for !! plus they serve BEEEERRR !"}
{"text":"I love this place!! I come here every time I visit Toronto. You really get the most for your buck! The food is delicious, the staff is super friendly, and the prices are incredibly reasonable. I'd recommend this place to anyone! They even serve beer! This is where I get my chicken and beer fix. YUM!"}
{"text":"Fast and friendly service. Great food with fair price. The fried chicken wings are delicious, especially when paired up with Molson Canadian beer. Great stop for a quick bite as well as ordering to-go because of its quality and price. Definitely recommend it if you're looking for some quick Chinese food."}
{"text":"Food is just amazing. Very flavourful and inexpensive. It's cooked in such a way that there is very little oil. Definitely worth a trip to try their dishes.
BBQ Pork on top of noodles is very nice.
Special Chicken and Rice is a classic go to, still amazing."}
{"text":"BEST BANG FOR BUCK. Quality is good. price is great. taste is awesome. One of the best bang for bucks in GTA! could be cleaner and area is slightly ghetto."}
{"text":"This place has been in business for many years (though under different owners) Restaurants don't stick around for years and years in the same location if their food is no good and calypso gardens is no exception.

The food is a Chinese Caribbean fusion that's just awesome. Lo Mein, Chow Mein, Fried rice, and a vast assortment of meats to go on top. Served with some super hot sauce on the side.. my mouth is watering just thinking about it.

The location itself is VERY underwhelming. Hot in the summer, cold in the winter, poorly decorated, poorly furnished, very small. But really... WHO CARES? Good food, cheap prices.

A coat of paint, some new furnishings, run the AC in the summertime, and I'd bump this to 4/5 in a second."}
{"text":"I have been coming here religiously for years with my dad. It has always been great. a hidden gem by all means."}
