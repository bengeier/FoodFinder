{"text":"$19 chicken entree served with instant mashed potatoes. Ridiculous. Asked for fries instead and they were tough and tasted like old oil. The waitress was very sweet though."}
{"text":"I had the chicken flatbread with sweet-chili sauce. Very good. Great portions. My husband had the burger. Omg it was huge and really good. Dinner fries was a large portion as well. Waitress a little dingy and I'm not sure if she had ever been a waitress before tonight but was very attentive. My friend Warren said the Tomato bisque was really great."}
{"text":"I've only eaten here for breakfast on several visits to this Hilton Garden Inn location. Nothing special about the food, but extremely friendly service and attention to detail. They do a great job with my custom order and check back for accuracy and satisfaction."}
{"text":"A breakfast buffet that still provides unlimited bacon despite the impending bacon-shortage is alright by me."}
{"text":"Very comfortable place.  Great food, friendly staff. Full bar, lots of tv's, and good location next to NASCAR museum on MLK. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Located on first floor of Hilton Garden Inn conveniently located near other hotels and NASCAR Museum. Nice atmosphere with ample staff. Menu is one page with various offerings. My wife and I both ordered the hamburger with a side of fruit and french fries which came with meals. The burgers were huge with good size of sides. Not very often you receive a meat patty which is larger than the good size bun. And the cheese melted to perfection running over the patty. Came with lettuce, tomato and onion. Can not review any drinks as we only had water. But can say there were only four or five bottled beers on menu."}
