{"text":"I have been dying to try German bakery Hof Kelsten for lunch after my mother brought their panettone to Christmas dinner. It was moist, delicious and certainly special, the best I have ever tasted. But, quite pricey. I went in this week for a sandwich and coffee. The VLT was fatty, chewy veal pancetta between two measly slices of white toasted bread for 8$ plus tax. The coffee was mediocre. The woman who served me was bitter and unsmiling, and rushed me to order. The decor has that unfinished or under-construction look to it which I don't get. I don't care if you are trendy, Hof Kelsten, but you gotta work on your sandwiches and your staff, you've left me disappointed and hungry. I will come back for pastries and update this review then."}
{"text":"The menu is simple and everything looks delicious. I had the breakfast sandwich + regulach + latte + pumpernickel bread. All very good! 

The bad thing is that they serve everything in paper plates and plastic containers :( 

I would go back because their bread worth it!"}
{"text":"I will dream about Hof Kelsten for years to come. The choco-coco croissant was sheer perfection. crunchy and sweet and perfectly bakes on the outside, moist and chewy on the inside.  Chocolate with a hint of coconut. We traveled across the city a second time on our vacation just to have these again (note: only available on weekends).

The apricot scone was also incredible. Almost like a cross between a scone and a shortbread cookie (maybe it was the butter...). I would pay a lot of money for this recipe... 

Coffee was not memorable, but I don't think that's why you come here."}
{"text":"I wanted to buy a perfect to make french toast.  Then I googled and found that Challah bread will be very good to make one.  

So I went there.  It is surprising big.  I took the classic one, $6.5.   Taste quite rich and good since there are a lot of egg and butter in it, but easily gets dry I think.  That's why it's perfect for french toast I guess.  

Their other baked stuffs look good,too.  But after bought the big Challah, I think I will go back to try their other things later. :)"}
{"text":"The best bobka, pastries & challah bread French toast in the Montreal plateau region!"}
{"text":"The pastries are great, as is the location and friendly staff.  I found it a bit expensive in terms of what you get - my sandwich was $8 but very small.  But you can't go wrong with their bread items!"}
{"text":"Great bakery. Love the raisin challah on Fridays and the chocolate babka. Hands down best challah and babka in Montreal."}
{"text":"The chopped liver sandwich was really good! With lots of lightly pickled veg. The chicken salad was a little plain for me."}
{"text":"Who thought a bakery would have one of the BEST coffees in Montreal? The place is not fancy (and a little hipsterish) but their bread is amazing. And their sandwiches are so exquisite each time I go I order 2 (gravlax and foie haché), and I don't share!"}
{"text":"I've been looking forward to try this place for brunch for a while as I had heard good things about it.  To be fair,  my rating should be 3,5.  

What I liked most and deserves 4 stars was the food.  I ordered the pain doré brunch plate.  The pain doré itself ranks in the best pain dores I have tried.  The fact that it's made out of homemade thick slices of bread and pure maple syrup makes it just excellent.  It also comes with a side of back bacon tasty as they season it. Also had a side of Kale which was fresh and generous.

What made me note it down to a 3.5 star is the setting which is very basic and the fact that you don't have a sit down service.  I enjoy cozy and we'll thought out decors and although the small plants are cute, the setting lacks a bit of warmth and comfort especially since you don't get table service as this means a lot of people getting up to get their plates from the counter.  The good news is that both decor and table service can be added and updated to go with the deliciousness  of their pastries and brunch plates. 

Overall, I enjoyed my brunch very much as it was tasty but might take my brunch to go next time."}
{"text":"I posted a photo of the VLT sandwich. At $9 a pop, I definitely won't be going back. Nice service, though that doesn't make up for it."}
{"text":"Just an outstanding place- they do only a few things, but do them extremely well. The cookies, rugelah, and Danishes are among the best in the city. The coffee as well is great- very rich and full flavoured. A nice repurposed space that used to be a video rental store."}
{"text":"Great latte. I enjoyed the danish I had, but until I have another pastry that leaves a better impression this place gets a 4."}
{"text":"First timer on a brunchy Sunday, and although I am not ecstatic about the Hof (yet), there are some great things to mention: atmosphere was very nice and the service prompt and friendly (thus, review should be 3.5 stars). Had the schnitzel brunch special with hash browns and 2 eggs that came with a green sauerkraut-sauce and sliced bread. For the price I definitely thought I got stuffed. Tastewise however it wasn't crazy special, rather on the bland side. The intriguing sounding sauerkraut-sauce was not really sauerkraut-y..?! Their coffee was good, strong and straightforward. Best thing about this sampling was their breadpudding thingy... The baguette's nice and crispy, but personally I prefer the one from their competition further up on the main... Nevertheless, I will go back for more coffee and try their pastries, croissants, challah and other breads for sure..."}
{"text":"Hof Kelsten is my temple. This is the best bakery in Montreal, hands down, no competition. My friends and I have a weekly ritual of going to Hof and getting a whole chocolate babka and the whole thing is always devoured in a matter of minutes (...there are only 3 of us). No matter what you get here is incredible. The croissants are OUT OF THIS WORLD like maybe better than what you can get in FRANCE. Their brunch is also really good - hello CHALLAH FRENCH TOAST. This bakery is the perfect combination of Jewish comfort food and incredible breads and pastries. Hof kelsten is the ultimate treat and if you choose anything else you are a fool!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the rugelach here, but the service left much to be desired. 

I came here because I wanted to try the challah bread, but I didn't realize they only served it on Fridays. I asked the staff just to confirm, because the menu was in French, and she was unfriendly and a bit standoffish when I asked her for recommendations

Still, would probably come back to try the bread, but I just wish the service was friendlier"}
{"text":"What an amazing bakery and coffee shop.  We saw this wonderful place on the food channel and decided when we were going to Montreal this had to be one of our stops. 
It is located on a very heavily traveled street. We had to park a block away.  This was not terrible because there are a lot of stores to look at on the way.
The aroma  of all the baked goods and coffee brewing  make it impossible to order just one item.  We ordered  the bubka and biscottii.  The bubka was so fresh and full if chocolate we felt compelled to bring some back home with us.  The biscotti was so fresh and crisp.  We have been to well known Italian bakeries and I have to say these are probably the best we've had. 
The only reason I didn't give a 5 star is because there is so little seating.  We had to wait 25 minutes to get seats.   We will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Walked in to this retro-modern looking bakery with the purpose of just buying ONE Chocolate Babka to bring back home to NJ, ended up buying two....as well as: two croissants, three bialys, four strawberry-walnut rugelach, a baguette, two coffees, two egg sandwiches and a hot chocolate. EVERYTHING WAS DELICIOUS. The wonderful bespectacled saleswoman who helped us was super awesome, patient and helpful.
Can't wait to return to Montreal just to stop here first!"}
{"text":"Wow! Now you're talking about awesome taste! The best flavors ever found in a sandwich. The bread is delicate and tasty. The smoked salmon and beef were amazing, leveraged by very inventive tasty dressings. The service is very friendly. The place is rather cramped, but perfect for a quick bite. Both take out bread and deserts are worth the detour!"}
{"text":"My young daughter and I went for lunch this weekend and we both loved it! Gravlax sandwich on rye was delicious. Great matzo ball soup (deep, rich colored broth). Chocolate danoise was amazing. The latke wasn't actually my favorite type of latke, however. I prefer a crunchier latke through and through, but I did love the dipping sauce. 

Oh, and the espresso? Fantastic. They have a great barista."}
{"text":"Stopped here on a rainy day for brunch and it was delicious. French toast with crisp pancetta and berry rugelach to top it off. Everything looked delicious - salads, sandwiches, baked goods. I don't think you could go wrong. Great place for a snack, brunch or lunch. Note: No wifi available."}
{"text":"I was excited to learn that a new bakery had opened in the space previously occupied by the Superclub Videotron, on Saint-Laurent just north of Mont-Royal.  

Designed by super designer Zebulon Perron, the shop itself doesn't give off a bakery vibe when passing by, and it actually took a friend to point out that it was indeed a bakery for me to take notice.  Instead from the outside it looked more like an industrial half finished space to me, reminiscent of hospital food prep areas.  But once I took the time to stop in (rather than just driving or biking by the big floor to ceiling windows), I realized that it really worked once inside.    The counter is long and there are all kinds of breads stacked behind it, and sweets tucked into the display case. There's a looooooong table at which to perch and nibble on goodies.  And those floor to ceiling windows are GREAT for people watching.  I especially liked the fact that they kept the after hours delivery box in the doorway, just in case people forgot the space's old vocation.

But was it good?  It was!  So far I've only tried a chocolate danish and a loaf of ciabatta, but I'll be back for sure!  I'm especially excited to go back on a Friday when they make challah bread, a delicious egg bread.  They also make sandwiches at lunch, and I can see myself popping in for a quick bite during summer Fridays, when I'm too lazy to make my own sandwich, or perhaps not so inspired to stock my kitchen with goodies.  The chocolate danish I had was more of a chocolate cinnamon bun than what I would consider a danish . . . and that's a good thing.  The dough was rich but not too heavy, chocolately but not too gooey.  Very very delicious, for someone who takes her baked goods seriously."}
{"text":"It's Sunday morning. Wake up, put pants on, and make your way to Hof. Guaranteed to be the best decision you'll make all day. 

I'm a regular at the Guillaume bakery a few blocks up, which is known for their French style breads. Hof, on the other hand, specializes more in Jewish style baked goods. Both are equally fantastic, just depends on your mood. 

But seriously, everything here is wonderful. Disclaimer I've never tried the in-house brunch (and have heard mixed reviews), but have had my weight in breads, cookies, babka, strudels, you name it. And oh my, this place is good. 

They also serve up a mad latte here. 

So grab some raisin bread and bialys and start the day right. 

Note: it's pricey, but yes it's worth every penny."}
{"text":"Outstanding baked goods. The owner, Jeff, is a great guy and a master at what he does. Stop by for coffee, breakfast, or to pick up a loaf of bread to go. This place is world class."}
{"text":"Hof Kelsten may not say much from the outside, since the store doesn't have any signs. Yet, their breads, pastries, and brunches speak for themselves. Who needs a sign, when you're that well known!
The decor on the inside is unique, you may think it's under construction, but in reality.. It's not. You step into a world of amazing & fantastic quality breads and pastries, which are also available at some of the top restaurants in Montreal. 
Jeffrey(The owner) who makes you smile at all times, is one very talented, hard working, and great person. Once you met him, you understand why his pastries taste so well, he puts 100% dedication into them, with the finest & European ingredients. 
Now onto the staff, when I walked into the store, the greeted me so nicely, five minutes later I walked out with a box full of pastries, and a loaf of bread. The staff was kind enough to hand it to me, and open the door, also asked if I needed any help. All this being said, it left a warm, comforting feeling of wanting to come back again and again. Who needs an expensive French patisserie when you have a warm and comforting Hof Kelsten!"}
{"text":"Best croissant And chocolatine. Bread is very good too. Would love to see them finish the construction because the sit down ambiance is pretty shabby."}
{"text":"Soooo. Good. We had brunch there (challah French toast was amazing) and ordered bread to go. Everything was made to perfection, and the service was just lovely. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Hof has a little something I can't quite put my finger on that makes you feel happy to be there.

The bread here is to DIE for! You MUST try a ricotta + poppy seed twisty bread thingy (yes, it's an order). The coffee is good too and so are the pastries."}
{"text":"This place is a peculiar mix of Jewish and French baked goods, but seeing as those are my two favorite varieties, I can't complain. I had an epi baguette and a rugelach. The epi was crusty and flavorful, so was very satisfying. The rugelach (strawberry and walnut, if I recall correctly), was too nouveau for my rugelach tastes. The filling was a bit sickly sweet and overwhelmed the crust, although the crust would have been good on its own in a different configuration."}
{"text":"It's a very ... pretty space. It's modern and makes you feel like you're about to experience something wonderful. I was very excited to go based on the reviews here, so I finally went one day and decided to try the ricotta and poppyseed bread twist. It was very dry, not particularly flavorful, just not good. I took one bite and if it weren't for the fact that I was really hungry, would have thrown it away. It was that bad. I might give Hof Kelsten a second chance (that strawberry rugelach looked so good, but then again, so did the ricotta bread thing) but not super excited to."}
{"text":"Love the Food, great service, they even changed the bread to French Baguettes, lovely atmosphere, strongly recomend the Brunch menu and of course, the apple cake!!!"}
{"text":"Had French toast for branch. It was good. The service was nice too. Would like to visit again."}
{"text":"Amazing sandwiches and baked goods, super friendly counter staff. I had the Poitrine De Boeuf which was a perfect blend of tender brisket with apple and red cabbage (I never would have thought these could go together so well, but they do). Don't skip the apple cake with salty-caramel sauce or the chocolate babka (comes with extra chocolate inside and has more of a brioche texture than what you would find in the US). Also - get some chopped liver, this is the place."}
{"text":"GREAT FOOD, QUESTIONABLE SERVICE

The bakery is in a prime location on St Laurent Blvd. By recommendation, I decided to go with the GRAVLAX, a bold smoked salmon sandwich. It is definitely one of the BEST form of smoked salmon i have had. Strong smoked salmon with a layer of lettuce and tomato on soft wheat bread generously coated with cream cheese. The combination was perfect and the sandwich was truly delicious. 

Being a popular in travel magazines, I would assume that people visiting Montreal would want to try the place out. They are not an exclusive cash only place, but they have some strange issues going on with electronic payment (international debit cards). I was told by the staff that they do not accept credit cards (debit only) and they also do not accept international debit cards (USA). They do not accept payment in US dollars (conversion) and was pretty much only left with an option to pay by cash. Displaying specific instructions on acceptable modes of payment would be helpful. 

Even after withdrawing cash, there was some confusion among the staff to take payment before or after service. This confusion caused delay in service and sort of left me waiting in line while the food had already been prepared."}
{"text":"Location: On the Main. Street parking only.

The place: I was actually surprised at Hof's size. For some reason, I'd expected the storefront to be teeny tiny. The shop is fairly airy and there's a decent seating area as well. 

The goods: Fresh bread, cookies and a few pastries. In terms of the bread, they offer a few varieties, such as Pumpernickel, sunflower seed, baguettes, Ciabatta etc. While I did eyeball the Pumpernickel, I decided to go for the Ciabatta because I had big plans to pick up some Italian salami at the market and what goes better with salami than CIabatta? Nothing, that's what. And, as luck would have it, the nice boy behind the counter sliced my bread for me. Score.  As far as the bread goes, you can't possibly get any fresher than this. Typically, Ciabatta is heavy and somewhat dense, not to mention chewy. My loaf? Light and airy and SO fluffy I could have used it as a pillow. In terms of consistency, it had a bit of chew to it and it was perfect. 

Service: The fellow who served me was awesome and super friendly. He took the time to explain the bread's 'make-up' and how to best preserve it if I wasn't going to eat it all in the same week. However, the chick at the counter, while (eventually) friendly, made me wait 5+ minutes while she flirted with the customer in front of me. I can appreciate the need to talk to cute boys and all that, but do it on your own time. 

Price point: On par with most bakeries. I think my loaf was $4 , but it was a pretty good size so you'll hear no complaints from me."}
{"text":"Supposed to be the best croissant in Montreal...
They are averaged at best
So far it's at Les baguettes en l'air in Rimouski that I've tasted by far the best croissant.

Coffee art is good but serving their large size latte in a paper cup is really not up to the name and reputation of the place and environmentally speaking it's just a shame.

Will change my rating and comment if this change."}
{"text":"Came into Hof Kelsten on a rainy sunday morning. Upon walking into the cute little coffee shop, you can smell the amazing buttery crossiant and pastries! Came in and had the intention to buy some to bring back home to Toronto.

Ordered the following items:
2 butter crossiant (super crispy and flaky inside- definitely worth it!!!)
1 chocolate crossiant (there are two huge sticks of milk chocolate inside this crossiant... SOOOOO delicious)
1 almond crossiant ( filled with a lot of almond paste and almond pieces outside. very delish and not overly sweet)

2 Spinach ricotta pastry puffs (very tasty, but have had better in Toronto before!)
1 tomato feta ricotta pastry puff (very unique with the stuffed ricotta inside a buttery pastry - similar to a crossiant)

Definitely worth a visit if you're staying around the st.laurent area."}
{"text":"Very friendly staff who was very helpful since we had no idea to to order or what to order. The food was extremely good and the prices were reasonable."}
{"text":"This is the true meaning of New Jewish Cuisine. Taking traditional recipes and stepping them up to the 21st century without trying to invent the wheel. 
The Matzo ball soup is incredible, it is very different than the ones at regular delis-  they smoke the bones prior to cooking it, giving a very rich flavour. The chopped liver is smooth and manages to be light. The baked goods are remarkable and if you are lucky enough to get there on Friday- Get the Challah!
The chef, Jeffrey Finkelstein went back to his roots after working at prominent kitchens around the world. His love to his nana's food became a joy to the food community in Montreal."}
{"text":"So yummy! The eggs were fantastic, and above all else, the ambiance was casual and bright. A perfect place for a non-table service brunch. Just you, your newspaper, a friend and some quality food. I would definitely return."}
{"text":"Le pain est bon, mais à ce prix là il devrait être incroyable. Points bonus pour le décor mais sans plus. Si vous voulez du premium, essayez plutôt Guillaume ou de Gascoygne."}
{"text":"Wow. First stop straight from airport. Best croissants in the world!!! Better than the ones I ate in Paris. Amazing. Bring cash!!! No CC"}
{"text":"Hof Kelsten is owned by Jeffrey Finkelstein, who is known in Montreal as the 'bread guy.'  He supplies all the top restaurants with his various bread, and his creds include working at Toque!, French laundry, Per Se, and El Bulli.  His menu is strictly chef-driven, and offers items such as challah, ciabatta, baugettes, croissants, and also hot/cold beverages.  The hubs and I came here to try out some of their croissants - a regular croissant, a croissant sesame and amande, and a poppy seeded croissant with cheese - the croissants were all pretty okay, but I liked the croissant with the poppy seed and the cheese, as it had a nice little goat-cheese-esque hint to it with plenty of poppyseeds.   These were also pretty good when warmed in the microwave the next day for a quick morning snack!  I also saw a colorful special drink beverage, so I tried the Arnie P (can't pass up on an Arnold Palmer!) - this was super refreshing, a slight tartness, and yummy - I highly recommend!  The staff here are super friendly, and there are plenty of seats - the place is more modern and open, and I was surprised, as I thought it would be more of a hole-in-the-wall, industrial bakery place!  Lots of patrons coming in to get breads to go.

+run by Jeffrey Finkelstein, the 'bread guy'
+fresh croissants
+Arnie P drink :D
+friendly staff
+cash on Canadian debit only!"}
{"text":"Très bof déçue par les sandwich et soupes. Trop cher pour ce que cest. Ça vaut pas le coup"}
{"text":"Challah makes me hollaaaaaaaa. Babka makes me wanna adopt a new religion. Hallelujah! Singing high praises for a bakery that brings us loaves of rye, semolina, whole wheat, white, baguette and all kind of carby  goodness that are kneaded with know how & made with whole ingredients. Sandwiches are some of the best in the city that go beyond a 'like' to enter the territory of love. As for the brunch - haven't been but I'd be down to try it. Amen."}
{"text":"Loveeeeeeeeed the pastries here. My husband and I found this bakery on several different websites, stating it was one of the best in town, and since we love a good pastry, we had to try it. We got plain and chocolate croissants, and brioche sucre... They were all incredible! Will definitely stop by to get some more before we leave town."}
{"text":"Love the bread, but must admit to being underwhelmed by the brunch. The salmon was tasty but the latkes lacked crunch and flavour, and the staff were weirdly strictly against cooking the eggs in the way our friends from our of town requested (all eggs must be runny? I can't help but feel confused by this.) I think too the paper plate idea doesn't work so well with runny eggs, and it increased the feeling of paying too much ($17) for not quite enough."}
{"text":"Now this is a bakery! Great location right down the street from Beauty's after you've already stuffed your face over there. They have a great variety to choose from and the babka is absolute chocolaty succulence. The only issue is that they don't sell it by the slice so you need to order the whole babka......so better go with a couple of other people or you'll have trouble not eating the whole thing on your own and then regretting it with a huge smile on your face."}
{"text":"Fantastic.  Croissants are perfect. The bread is beautiful. Wanted to buy loads of it to take home. Sampled quite a few pastries and everything was very good.  Decor tres hip - very nice.  Friendly service.  Very clean.  Well worth the visit.  Recommended."}
{"text":"I had brunch a couple weeks ago at Hof Kelsten and ordered the Challah French Toast, it was absolutely delicious with some poppy seeds, sesame and plain challah slices, maple syrup, one egg and two slices of veal pancetta. I really loved it!
The store is small but cute and everything looks great. It's definitely busy but since a enjoyable place to eat. 
A very nice experience I will be making soon again. How great to find such quality bread in Montreal!"}
{"text":"Challah french toast was great! The atmosphere of the cafe was similarly great. A large selection of pastries - wish I could have tried them all. The shakshuka was also delightful. Would definitely return."}
{"text":"Les viennoiseries étaient très bonnes, le service était courtois. J'y allais plus souvent dans ses  débuts, je ne sais trop pourquoi j'avais cesser... très charmant endroit si vous passez dans le coin, la déco est sublime (par jour ensoleillé) !"}
{"text":"Fantastic small minimalist bakery with no name on the outside so you could clearly walk by. What I love about HK is the baked products are seriously some of the best in MTL. I've sampled the chocolate babka pain perdu (glazed with caramel) and also I took a sourdough bread home. The sourdough is the closest thing to SF sourdough that you can get to. Then also we brought back some scones which were buttery, flaky and delicious. One small dissapointment was the cappuccino. I believe it to be some small house indie roasted coffee but I thought mine to be a bit cold and not very strong. Beware not many places to sit and they fill up fast. My next visit will be a whole chocolate babka and possibly some challah bread. Delicious stuff folks. If you are a carb king then this is your royal palace! Check it out!"}
{"text":"The baguettes and loaves are very good to excellent, although I prefer Boulangerie Guillaume's. The breakfast sandwich - white toast, American cheese, and a yolky fried egg on top - is simple and satisfying. 

At the moment, they are serving great coffee as part of a collaboration with Dispatch Coffee. The latte was very good -- better than Melbourne's across the street, and certainly at par with what the Dispatch truck served up this summer."}
{"text":"Delicious! I've been here a couple of times now and their baked good are too die for (calories don't count when the treats taste this good), and the latte is also delish and beautifully presented with a leaf design in the middle. Love it and so will you! Please note that they do not accept credit cards. Cash only. It's hipster, it's cool, it's trendy."}
{"text":"I had brunch here with two friends. It's very busy on weekend mornings. I got a sandwich, which was delicious. And i also got a pistachio croissant as a treat, which was also so good! My friends got the french toast and a salmon dish, and they really enjoyed it. I like the retro style of the bakery. They also have many other desserts and breads that you can take to go."}
{"text":"Sans aucun doute l'une des meilleures boulangeries à Montréal!

Il est aussi possible de manger sur place un bon sandwich, des viennoiseries, etc.

Bien localisé rue St-Laurent, prenez le temps d'arrêter, vous repartirez avec un grand sourire!"}
{"text":"This chic bakery-cafe actually lives up to the hype.  I was pleased it still had a decent selection of pastries at 5:00pm.  We split a strawberry regulach, which was flaky, buttery, and bursting with fresh fruit.  I loved it.  My macchiato was perfect as well.  Next time, I'm not sharing."}
{"text":"Am I blessed or cursed to have two excellent bakeries in mere walking distance from me? With Guillaume just north on Laurier and Hof on Mont Royal, its a carbo-philes dilemna on St Laurent these days!

My early review of Guillaume had that as my fave baguette place. Hof Kelsten is competing very closely for that spot. Its a dead heat at this point which baguette I prefer.

One advantage Hof Kelsten has is their cafe latte's are great. Totally unexpected for a bakery! They do desserts too, which are on my to eat list, and have weekend brunch.

So my preferred baguette genre - Hard crust which is crunchy and moist bread, 80% hydration. Lather it up with butter and nom nom nom!"}
{"text":"Good pastries & bakeries. Some eggs & sandwiches as well for brunch or lunch. Service at the counter was not friendly."}
{"text":"This is the bakery that serves all the best restaurants and bars in the city. Some great standards in terms of bread. I have had many from the baguette to Rye and many others and they are all great. That is why it has been rated one of the city's best. I haven't eaten any sandwiches yet but look for an updated review when I do. ONE IMPORTANT thing, this is the only place in Montréal that I know of the serves Biolys. Biolys are a New York specialty that are amazing....bagel like bread with an onion centre. I love it! Worth a try. Only a half dozen made each day."}
{"text":"The best croissant anywhere in the world. The croissant has a little twang that is intriguing and delicious. The baker used to work with Ferran Adria and his training is definitely put to use make delicious baked goods and sandwiches."}
{"text":"J'attendais depuis un bon moment de passer par cette boulangerie. Je ne me souvenais plus de l'adresse, mais je me disais que je ne pourrais pas manquer l'établissement, je verrais bien le logo ou le nom de la boulangerie de loin. Et bien non!!! Je suis passée devant et ai du rebrousser chemin. En poussant la porte je me demandais même si j'étais à la bonne place, mais oui. Il semblerait qu'on n'ai pas tant investi sur le décor, c'est dommage, ça fait pas chaleureux, ça donne même pas envie de traîner là pour siroter un bon café. C'est surement plus pour le take-out. J'ai pris le thé glacé / limonade maison qu'on m'a recommandé. Mouais pas vraiment top. Rempli de glaçons, ça ne goûtait pas grand chose.... Je reviendrais uniquement pour tester leurs produits, le palmier qui venait juste d'être concocté et tout nouveau sur le menu semblait délicieux. 
Donc mon avis est basé sur l'ambiance, le décor ou devrais-je dire le non décor et la boisson que j'ai consommée. Je ne peux donner mon opinion sur les produits de boulangerie...."}
{"text":"Hof Kelstein ranks #1 on my list of amazing Hofs, surpassing both David Hasselhoff and Germany's Hofbrauhaus. Why? Because unlike the latter, it makes me feel good about life. I mean, seriously... how could you eat one of their bursting-at-the-seam-with-cheese breakfast sandwiches and not have an optimistic outlook on life? And with latkes reminiscent of Channukah dinners or breads so fluffy you could use them as pillows, this is really all you need to be happy."}
{"text":"While running errands in the area I found myself hungry and in need of a quick lunch.  That's when I remembered that I wasn't far from Hof Kelsten and that a friend had highly recommended it to me.  It's easy to walk by this bakery and miss it because it doesn't have any large sign out front that easily identifies it.  However, you might know you're nearby when you start smelling the tempting aromas of freshly baked bread.  Start following those scents and you will find it.  The bakery is fairly large inside and seating didn't seem to be an issue when I was there.  The place itself is rather bare and simplistic.

If you're planning on grabbing a quick bite they have sandwiches and a small brunch menu on weekends.  I ordered a gravlax sandwich.  It was a little small given the price but it was tasty and the bread was so soft and chewy and very fresh.  I did enjoy it quite a bit.  Alas despite the high quality of the sandwich it was no match for the chocolate babka pain perdu which was simply divine.  Just writing this review has me yearning for another slice of it. It too was so soft, chewy and very chocolatey.  Most importantly all the food here was fresh as fresh can be.

The prices were okay and if memory serves me I paid about $14.  Like I said the sandwich could have been bigger given the price but the pain perdu was just right.  The quality was definitely there though and I will most certainly be back to try the other items on their menu."}
{"text":"The babka are heaven ! it's like drug ! you have to try.
Coffee amazing, the brisket sandwich is heaven so is the chopped liver one too.

Really a place to go again, again and again.

Really a nice addition the area."}
{"text":"OO que oui,c'est une belle boulangerie que c'est très agréable de luncher.Babka ouf,le pain au levain à conseillé.J'habite loin mais ça serait mon lieux de prédilection.Meilleur endroit de 2017 9.5/10"}
{"text":"Ça faisait des années que je n'avais pas goûté une si bonne danoise aux raisins ! 

J'y ai lunché un jour de pluie, bien assise devant leurs grandes fenêtres. J'ai aimé le sandwich au poulet, où des morceaux de pommes prennent place ce que j'ai adoré, mais il manquait un peu de goût. Leur salade de kale est très bonne et très fraiche ! Comme dit ci-haut, la danoise fut succulente, un vrai coup de coeur ! L'allongé fut également très bon, fort à souhait !"}
{"text":"Hof Kelsten is the latest addition to Mile End's boulangerie scene, and it instantly became recognized as a city-wide contender.  Baker/owner Jeffrey Finkelstein built up a reputation supplying many of Montreal's top restaurants with their bread before opening up to the public.  The approach leans towards Central Europe (caraway rye, rugelach, babka, etc.), but Hof Kelsten bakes some French loaves too (including my favourite Montreal baguette at the moment).  

They also serve meals (lunch, brunch), but so far I've stuck to the baked goods.  The pastries are generally good, and they're definitely refreshingly different from the kind of fare one tends to find in Montreal's bakery scene, but I've encountered problems with undercooked items from time to time, so now I just focus on their bread."}
{"text":"I love the decor here!!! Raw/simple/wild/nice.

They have good bakeries and coffee, come and enjoy your afternoon."}
{"text":"Very good place. We had the gravlax sandwiches which were excellent, pastry which was good, and a challah. The challah looked great but tastewise left something to be desired. Perhaps I'm spoiled by great challah near where I live. Overall quite good and I would return."}
{"text":"Came here to pick up some pastries for the office today and WOW, so freaking good. I got an assortment of the rugelach, danishes and a gorgeous looking loaf of challah that I saw being pulled from the oven. Everything is so amazing, as dense as it should be and not too heavy on the fillings and this is hands down, some of THE best challah that I have ever had (am loving the poppy seed and sesame seed mix.) I am a huge fan now and the staff kept me entertained while I waited for my challah to come out of the oven. I will definitely be a regular here!! The latte was also most excellent."}
{"text":"Over the past few months, I had heard plenty about a bakery right on the edge of Mile End. A place started by a chef who, turns out, sells bread to many of the best restaurants in the city - Joe Beef, Toqué! and Nora Gray to name a few - something that I had never known and that completely blew my mind. The fact that all of these places look to Chef Jeff Finklestein for bread speaks volume about the quality of his product. His new bakery Hof Kelsten now allows us common folk to get a fresh loaf for ourselves.

Hof Kelsten is located just off the corner of Saint-Laurent and Mont Royal in what I recalled being an old super club Videotron which was confirmed when I noticed that the overnight return slot in still present with the sticker above it. There is no sign outside and the interior is relatively sparse - unfinished wood counters, a white tile wall, concrete floor and a few spot to sit down. The only indication of the name is the green fluorescent lights shaped into Hof Kelsten above the counter. Behind the bread wall, you can see the large kitchen where all the work is done.

Hof Kelsten offers a variety of bread and pastries with a few weekly specials such as Challah only available on Fridays. For my initial visit, I went with a loaf of their sourdough. Now I love sourdough bread - it is pretty much the only bread I eat when in the States as it is readily available there. I have never been able to find good sourdough to bring home here until now. This bread was great - beautiful crust, great flavour and perfect texture. I finally have sourdough bread in Montreal. Thank the heavens!

For the bread alone, I will be coming back quite often from here on out but there is even more. They also have a sandwich menu and a number of other items with a strong Jewish influence. Grabbing lunch, I went with the brisket sandwich with a half portion of Matzo ball soup and some latkes. The brisket is served warm with sliced apples, red cabbage and beet slaw with what appeared to be a homemade thousand island dressing all on the house rye. Just a wonderful sandwich. I never would have thought of apples and thousand island dressing with brisket but the combination works extremely well.

The Matzo soup was wonderful as well - great depth of flavour in the stock (and surprisingly not as salty as I expected), generous amount of chicken and vegetables in the soup and the matzo balls themselves were great. A perfect addition on a cold December as it was.

The last item was the latkes - quite large individually. Great crust on them while maintaining a nice texture inside. The surprising plus was the dipping sauce - a nice sweet addition that offset the lack of actual apple sauce to use instead (Note that I've always been a apple sauce over sour cream guy).

All in all, Hof Kelsten is a great bakery that lived up to all the praise I've heard and then some. The fact that I am only a quick bike or drive (or longish walk) away means that I have found my new \"neighbourhood\" bakery. Getting restaurant caliber bread on a weekly basis will be a beautiful thing and something that everyone near and far should run over for as quickly as they can.

Cheers!"}
{"text":"Absolutely love their bread. Used to order it every week when I used the Lufa Farms service. In fact, my biggest regret from dropping that service is the loss of regular supply of the HK breads! I occasionally drop by the HK shop to get some fresher bread and it's even more outstanding. I haven't tried their other items, brunch, etc. though."}
{"text":"I finally popped in to Hof Kelsten to try out how they matched up to Guillaume.  I was happy enough to see that the folks at HK aren't merely copying what Guillaume is doing en anglais.  Aside from the utilitarian vibe (cement floors, unpainted/unfinished wood walls, etc.) the two are apples and oranges.

I ordered a special club sandwich which was an interesting twist on the classic club: some sort of herb-infused oil (I'm guessing tarragon, there was no explanation) and whole seeds of coriander which, while giving a nice burst of coriander flavour, weren't exactly pleasant to chow into.  There are these rad things called spice mills that could easily remedy that.

My wife got a chicken salad sandwich which was nothing necessarily special to write home about.  Hof Kelsten chicken salad = chicken salad.

Lastly, the bread.  I'm crazy about bread and that was easily the best part of the meal.  It would make sense that the bread is the specialty here, because it was the most redeeming part of the sandwich, but at 10$ a sandwich, I'd rather just grab a loaf and make a sandwich at home.

We happened to come in around 13h on a Saturday, and were the first in line yet from order to reception of food, the whole process took around 15 minutes.  I've worked in plenty of delis and restaurants that make sandwiches and unless the kitchen staff happened to be on break as soon as we ordered, this is a long time to wait for a couple of sandwiches.  For a deli, this is pretty sad.

All in all, unfriendly service, long wait, and overpriced fare.  No thanks, I'll go to Guillaume or make sandwiches at home.  If anything was organic or warranted the costs, it'd be a deal.  Knowing how cheap the ingredients must've been, I won't be back."}
{"text":"Amazing bread, really great bread. A little pricey, but hey... it's worth it."}
{"text":"I go here to pick up baked goods and it's one of the best bakeries in Montreal in my opinion. Most people come here to pick up things to go, and I think this is the main highlight of this place. They have brunch and coffee which is good and semi-self service with a relaxed environment but it's outshined by the standard pastries they offer. The prices are fair for the quality and the lines aren't ever too long. Staff is kind as well and the place has a nice homey feel in the morning. Definitely recommend!"}
