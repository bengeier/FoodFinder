{"text":"I came here with a Yelp-elite on the invite of the owner. They've only been open for 4 months now, but seem to be doing fantastic! The owner was extremely welcoming and generous, is trying to improve her business in every way, and most importantly is willing to understand her customers. She didn't incentivize me in any way to sway this post. In all honestly, I admire her genuine efforts to provide the best service and products possible. I took some time with the menu, but she was patient with me and allowed me to sample some options. I ended up ordering a mango strawberry slush with aloe and was absolutely impressed! It was fresh, felt healthy and natural. Most boba places use powdered ingredients. Every time I see taro boba on the menu, I ask if it's powder or fresh. Here, they make it fresh and to me, that already is an indication that this is a legitimate boba shop. Would highly recommend!"}
{"text":"This place really hits the spot when I have a boba craving. The owner gave us samples of their milk tea. The organic milk tea was amazing and I highly recommend it. Definitely try to get the mango drinks, since they have the freshest mangoes.

The matcha latte was really good as well and wasn't too sweet. They even import their matcha from Japan. 

Overall, Mango Rabbit emphasizes on quality and they do a great job showcasing that."}
{"text":"Made with fresh fruits!!!
It will be the healthiest one I promise!
Choose your own sugar level, ice level, and perfect! 
My favorite one is the WATERMELON PEACH SLUSH WITH BOBA of course.
Everyone is very friendly and they have free games that you can can share with yoir friends :)
I'm excited to see the transformation after they will redesign the place."}
{"text":"Decided to check out the cute little place near the ASU campus after seeing the infamous bear IG photos. 

The first time going, I ordered the strawberry kiwi smoothie which I liked a lot. I can tell the drinks are made out of real fruit to a certain extent because I had minor allergic reaction (since I'm a bit allergic to strawberry ha). Obviously didn't stop me from ordering it the second time I was there. So far they've been consistent with the drink sugar level. Not sure if it'll continue seeing fruits do go out of season. 

The third time I went I ordered a regular boba milk tea and I wasn't all that impressed. Tasted a bit powdery. So I don't recommend their milk teas. 

The popcorn chicken was pretty good. They do have the options to make it spicier if you asked! 

It's decent for working, sometimes. Other times there are kids running around so it's hard to hear yourself think. Parking is plenty, and facilities are clean."}
{"text":"Okurr okurr Mango Rabbit I see youuu! Tucked in a little shopping plaza right after Dorsey, you can find this yummy hidden gem! 

I've been on a mad boba craze and today I saw that MR was nearby, so of course I had to stop in! We were quickly greeted by an employee and the friendly owner upon walking in. 

They were really big on explaining that they only use the best and fresh ingredients for all their drinks! They also have healthy organic alternatives if you want that healthy fix! 

The drink combinations are endless and they also have written on a chalk board their favorites of the day! After picking your drink, you can also pick your ice level, and sweetness level, only making your drink 1000% more your way. 

We ended up getting a drink each. We ordered, one house milk tea with boba, one mango smoothie with boba & coconut jelly, and one taro milk tea with boba. Oh and some basil garlic popcorn chicken, hehe. 

Ummm excuse me? The popcorn chicken was SOOOO GOOD. Not salty, not dry, but just right. The chicken was piping hot when it was brought out, and the flavor was perfect! 

The taro milk tea was delicious! Real taro is actually used here to make the drink, so don't expect your drink to be purple. (Its only purple when the establishments use powdered taro, yuck) 

The house milk tea was so good!! The bobas definitely added the cherry on top to an already great tasting drink! The mango smoothie was delicious and so filling! You can definitely taste the fresh mango! 

There is plenty of seating and oh a GIGANTIC BEAR for some cute pictures! Last time I saw a stuffed animal this size was in South Korea! Hehe.

Happy hour is everyday from 3pm to 6pm. EVERYTHING IS 30% OFF!!! 

They offer free WiFi and they have plenty of board games and text books only to make school work a little easier.

Thank you, will be back again SOON."}
{"text":"Came in on a Saturday night and wasn't too impressed with the milk tea. I could barely taste any tea in my milk tea and I was disappointed in the lack of variety as well and wish that there were more flavor options available. The boba was average so overall this probably wouldn't be my first choice for bubble tea. I know they're somewhat new so hopefully it gets better from here but for the time being I'll likely be going elsewhere for my fix."}
{"text":"Mango Rabbit is quite cute!! From the spacious interior with cuddly bears and pictures hanging on the wall, I really liked the clean aesthetic of this new boba place!! I also got to meet the owner, Peggy, and she is so sweet and friendly - in fact, all of the people I interacted with here were very helpful and knowledgeable about the different offerings :)

I ended up trying the \"3 brothers milk tea\" at regular sweetness on the suggestion of a worker, and I'm so glad I did!! Pudding, boba and grass jelly in a sweet milk tea?! I couldn't ask for better additions :)  I also got to try the mango slushie at 50% sweetness, and that was quite delicious as well!! 

I've been to quite a few boba places, even in Az, and I really enjoyed my entire experience at Mango Rabbit!! I will definitely be back here, and bring more friends! :)"}
{"text":"Real fruits and organic drinks for healthy life. As a health activist, I like to look for drinks that are made from real fruits and not powder or fruit syrups and this place attracted me. I snuck in here at around 6 after the whole busy day running from the event in the hospital, to ASU and studied there when the library is closed for no reason. I was extremely tired but hungry (although I got free food in the hospital). I saw this place when browsing for new business in Yelp. Gotta support locally owned restaurant before I move temporarily to Palo Alto to work for a tech company. 

Type? The topping options are scarce. I can't never find any other place beside the one at Leelee that offers mini boba. Although, I usually only drink boba or pudding, depending on the type of drink. 

Taste? My drink tastes like strawberry! I was a bit doubtful about the strawberry, I thought it would be powder. But no, I chewed on real strawberries so I liked that. The popcorn chicken was delicious. There was no overdoing of salt like I-Tea. It's not as if they accidentally dropped the whole bottle of salt to give me high blood pressure. The chicken was cripsy and not hard. I love the chicken here so much better. Their wheel pie is good. I want more custard filling though. But the boba filling was novel! I haven't eatene one like that before.

Price? I would say the price is a bit pricey for the organic strawberry milk that I ordered. The small is $4.99. However, that was the specialty they have. The small milk tea cost $3.50 which would be alright for me. The wheel pie, on the other hand, is $1.50 each (like the expensive macarons that I never bought). Mekong sells these for $0.75 though. 

Atmosphere? I wish they have tables for more than 4 people because if I bring my group of 5 friends here, that wouldn't be enough and we play Uno. I think many groups also play Uno too. The owner is super friendly when I visited though. Not sure why the other people said she wasn't."}
{"text":"Tried the popcorn chicken which was great the season was interesting and they have few different Korean sauces to try with. The earl grey milk tea was very interesting and different. It goes well with the pudding. The bobas are house made and fresh. Also their mango drinks are great! I would say that's their speciality. The atmosphere is cute."}
{"text":"This is a really cute little place with plenty of comfy seating. And the staff was very polite and nice. On top of it all, my milk tea was delicious. Great options with sweetness/ice level."}
{"text":"Mango Rabbit is a cute boba shop with a cute and fun environment. They have a HUGE stuffed bear by the entrance. As for the drinks and food, it was all delicious! My sister and I both tried the organic milk tea with boba. We used the hooked app (download it, you get awesome deals on local restaurants, including mango rabbit!). The milk tea had a good and strong tea flavor and wasn't washed out by the milk. It was a little sweet for my taste so next time I'll go down on the sweetness (you can choose the sugar level, I got 100%). As for the boba, it had the best consistency compared to other boba places I've tried. The perfect chewiness!
My sister ordered French fries and they are made fresh to order, hot and crispy, and delicious! I will definitely be coming in again to try some of their fruit teas and slushes (they use real fruits and not syrups!)"}
{"text":"Holy Stuffed Bear! Friendly Service, Tasty Treats and  Jenga 

We walked into a nice clean shop of treats and were greeted by 2 smiling workers and a huge stuffed bear! Yes, the biggest stuffed bear I have ever seen!

I ordered the grapefruit green tea at 100% sweetness and it was a nice clean refreshing drink of tasty goodness. I would recommend this one. If you really like sweet you may want more than 100% sweetness in your drinks. 

The Matcha Latte at 100% sweetness tastes like a matcha latte, and again if you really like sweet ask for more than 100% sweetness. Otherwise I liked it at 100% but Donna likes more sugar than a normal human can stand!

The Mango Sago drink is a nice little treat to enjoy while you play Jenga on the table. Tasty and fresh little treat. 

The Fishballs were a tasty little snack. They have different dipping sauces to try, the honey mustard may be a bit overpowering for the fish balls for some people, but if you are like me and love mustard it will be tasty!

Prices are reasonable, quality is good, all in all a good spot. 

The atmosphere is clean and not cluttered. Ambient music is relaxing. 

This is a nice little spot to hangout for a while with friends and have some treats. 

Stop by and have yourself a little treat."}
{"text":"This place is awesome and more. They serves really delicious and fresh fruit slushies. The ice tastes great too, it tastes filtered. I mention the slush because there are places that use syrup and if you're like me you prefer real tastes.
The customer service clerks are nice and helpful. If you love tea, boba, or a good drink stop in for a personal, customizable and highly satisfying thirst quencher."}
{"text":"Came in on Sat afternoon for tasting.
Wasn't too busy, at this time, 4pm. 
First time at this establishment.
Believe this place used to be Milk Tea 101 from the sign on the cups they used. Resourceful, but as other mentioned, could use a sticker to cover it or something. 

Drinks:
I sampled the house milk tea* and premium organic milk tea.
Out of the 2, I personally prefer the house milk tea*. The organic milk has a flatter taste, hard to describe. I would recommend doing the 0% or 25% sweetness at most (I think that would be plently of sweet.) 

I actually ordered and tried the sea salt caramel milk tea @25% sweetness. 
 -Guess this was more of a take of sea salt caramel custard. Kind of works. Just enough of sea salt to taste it in the milk tea.  Just hints of the sea salt, not full on saltiness. The caramel flavor doesn't come through as much. If you don't like salt in your milk tea, than would not recommend it. Bad part is you can't sample this, as they need to mix and make it. 

I also ordered the classic mango slush with boba @0% sweetness. 
 -Shines in this category. 
 -They use actual mangoes and not artifical flavoring. They also do strawberry slushes and mixture of strawberry/kiwi. or mango/strawberry. 
 -would recommend 0 or 25% max sweet. 
 -one of the few places, besides jamba juice that uses real fruits. So Thumbs up. 

Boba - not too chewy, about right for me. Had it added to my mango slush. 

Snacks:
Basil popcorn chicken - good size of chicken bites. Has some crunch. Super hot, when they bring it out!! 
-Could use more flavor overall though. 
 -Tip: ask to have more chili powder added on to make it more spicy.

Wheel pie with custard - pretty decent, first time having it here in phoenix, but I have had it in other places. I like custard as opposed to red bean flavor. 

Price:
sea salt caramel milk tea - small - $3.50 (s), $4.50 (L)
Mango slush - $5.95 (one size) 
Boba - $0.50
Basil pop corn chicken $5.95
Wheel pie - forgot (it's on a separate menu) 

Environment: 1 \"long table\" all the way in the back for a bigger group. Some booths along the wall. rest are more 2 people seating. medium size place. They have a big Line bear for IG assuming you can avoid the glare from the window. 
They do have password protected wifi. 
1 restroom - was clean.

Service: Peggy is friendly and welcoming. Will accommodate what you need. She also makes the wheel pies on the weekends.  

Parking: big lot outside. no issues

Overall: Recommend the mango slush.
Will need to come back to try the other milk teas."}
{"text":"I have only been here once since I had such a bad experience. There were very few boba drinks to choose from and when I finally settled for something, the cashier don't get my order correct and as I waited a long while for my drink the ladies making the drinks let their hair fall into a drink(and noticed) and serve it to a consumer.  The boba drink I got was not mixed, the boba was hard, there was no sugar(it was bitter) though I had asked for it sweetend, and to top it all off, the drink was over 6 dollars!  I have had much better boba drinks else where."}
{"text":"It's been a long time since I've had so many things to rave about a boba spot - Mango Rabbit is probably my favorite in AZ!!! It makes me feel like I'm right back home in California! (And that giant bear is maybe comfier than my own bed)

I am OBSESSED with how they use fresh fruit here - no syrups!!! For anyone who doesn't like overly sweet drinks, you'll definitely love this! I got the Snow White Mango Green Tea and there were little chunks of mango amidst the perfect blend of green tea/mango smoothie type texture with a creamy foam top. I tried my friend's Snow White Strawberry  Green Tea and think that was equally amazing - just depends on your fruit preference. I tasted my friend's Caramel Sea Salt Milk tea with boba and could not stop stealing sips. It's not overly sweet and the boba texture is the ideal amount of chewy. On our way out, my friends all grabbed drinks to bring to their friends since it was still 30% off with Happy Hour. 

I already can't wait for the next time I come back!! I already know I want to try the mango sago with pomelo and the London Fog! Well actually, I want to try everything on the menu. This is a quality tea spot - strong tea flavors and fresh fruit. You can't go wrong with any of your choices! ("}
{"text":"3.25 stars!

May 3, 2018

First time here- met friends who also have never been.  One friend was personally invited by the owner/manager, so she invited other friends, one of which invited me to join them.  I'd have given 4 stars for my Grapefruit green tea, with coconut jelly and pudding, experience, but there was a very strong scent inside the shop that repulsed me for about ten minutes until my nose became desensitized to it.  I'm thinking disinfectant solution.  The same horrible smell I can't stand detecting at Subway shops-- I have relatives who love the sandwiches there.  (One word- azodicarbonomide.  No thanks!)  Another reason for the lower rating: I asked for \"mango sago\" drink and was told they didn't have any to serve, because they only use delicious fresh, sweet mangos to make the drink, and they didn't have any sweet mangos.  (I wonder what do they use for the other mango beverages served here??)  I specifically asked for Mango Sago, which is strangely listed under \"appetizers,\" as I'd recently read fellow friend Joyce W.'s three-star review and had seen the owner/manager's response and invitation for Joyce to return to try their specialty drink.  Why mention to try a specific drink if you aren't going to offer it anytime soon?

Oh, but I enjoyed my Grapefruit green tea, ordered at 25% sweetness, with coconut jelly and pudding added at an additional $0.75 cents per \"topping.\"  They're definitely worth the splurge, but next time I think I'll just skip the pudding with this drink.  Nothing wrong with the luscious pudding that has a brown sugar topping (made me think of how Mom and I prepare our Leche flans), but I'd feel better drinking a healthy fruity green tea with just coconut jelly.  Oh, you must try the coconut jelly!

Sorry to hear that one of my friends did not enjoy her drink (the Snow White Mango green tea with pudding), but it sure looked pretty.  I'll return as soon as I see others posting about enjoying that elusive Mango Sago beverage-appetizer!"}
{"text":"Crispy chicken and Snow White mango green tea are my favorite, it tastes extremely good! I also tried something else such as mango slush, organic house green and strawberry milk, it never let me disappointed! Then I recommend this place to my friends, they like it too!"}
{"text":"The owner is really kind and give us samples which can help us find favourite drinks?I like grapefruit green tea?Thanks peggy and I love this store?"}
{"text":"Well, I like mangoes, and I also like rabbits, but perhaps this little mango rabbit went down the wrong tropical rabbit hole. We got here a little before 6 and snuck in the last few orders of their happy hour from 3-6 for 30% off. I also indulged in their crispy chicken. 

The interior seems pretty much the same as predecessor Milk Tea 101 and while I understand wanting to use the Milk Tea 101 logo cups they have from taking over the previous business to save money, I found it weird. For me the cups and the identical interior gives off the impression that the store is the same but simply just renamed. If they kept all the cups and decor exactly the same, it makes you wonder what other elements they kept the same (Elements which I didn't particularly care for when it was still called Milk Tea 101). If they really want to differentiate themselves maybe at the very least they could get some stickers with their real logo on it and put those over the previous logo. Just a suggestion and only a minor issue though.

I zeroed in on the drinks with the little funky mango mascot next to them, since they were apparently signature drinks. Snow white mango green tea? Sounds good to me! I usually get drinks at 25% sweetness these days and have enjoyed them at this level but upon ordering, the cashier recommended a stronger sweetness since the mangoes they had were sour. Sour mangoes? Hmm. Did I just get Evil Queen Grimhilde tea instead of Snow White tea? (Luckily I did not see poison apple tea on the menu, nor did I hear any singing of \"Hi ho, hi ho, it's off for tea we go\") I guess I could see sour mangoes being used if they were green but if that's the case shouldn't it be listed as green mango green tea? I went with 50% sweetness as a result, adding pudding as a mix in. 

The crispy chicken came first, piping hot. It was decently crispy, and made from dark meat chicken chunks. The flavor and crispiness was a little lighter than at other places I've had similar snack items. The actual texture of the chicken was just OK, I've also had juicier and more flavorful chicken meat at other places. At $5.95 there was a good portion of chicken and enough to share with all my friends.

The mango drink was a blended mixture with the fresh mangoes, ice, and sweetener. There was a layer of crema on top and a decent amount of pudding on the bottom. To be honest I didn't really care for the drink which was especially disappointing since it was supposed to be a signature item. At other bubble tea places 50% sweetness is plenty of sweetness for me but here everything was still too sour. The pudding had more of a flan-like texture rather than a silken texture so if you like more firm puddings this is your place. The crema was also decent but I've had richer flavored versions at other bubble tea shops. For a green tea I didn't really taste too much tea flavor.

Service was pleasant, albeit a bit overzealous. I personally like less hovering but I'd rather have overeager service than nonexistent or rude service in the grand scheme of things. At least I know they are dedicated to treating their customers right.

Milk Tea 101, Mango Rabbit, what name will they think of next, Pineapple Pachyderm 202? (I'd try it)"}
{"text":"I ordered the 3 brothers milk tea, which contains boba, pudding, and grass jelly. It was awesome! I took a gamble with the sweetness and ordered 75%. It was the perfect amount of sweet and made for a delicious treat. This is one of my fave boba places for sure! This place was really spacious and clean and had free WiFi, making it a great hangout spot for after class. It's located in a complex with a parking lot so you don't have to worry about running into any Tempe parking issues either. Definitely give this place a try!!"}
{"text":"New ownership has taken over and the name is SO CUTE. I love the logo. The owner Peggy is so sweet and has top-notch customer service. 

These use fresh ingredients and their Creama is super tasty! The drinks are refreshing and has a great variety. I'll have to stop by and try their food some other time. 

Great place to relax with good selfie lighting with giant Brown plush that serves as your background. 

Recommended Drinks:
-Jasmine Green Tea with creama 
-Earl Grey Milk tea"}
{"text":"First off, the service here is so great. Peggy, the owner of Mango Rabbit is so sweet!  

Peggy took the time to let me taste the different milk teas that are on the menu and also explained how the drinks are made. My favorite was the earl gray milk tea! You should definitely try it.

I ended up ordering the Snow White mango green tea slush with creama and boba. I ordered 50% sweetness but I think I should have went with regular. The taste was okay but I really liked that they use fresh mango. There was mango slices in my drink and it was awesome that they use fresh fruit.

I also tried the popcorn chicken. I looooooved it so much! It had the perfect about of spices and the chicken was so flavorful and fresh. I would come here just for the chicken! They also had different dipping sauces like a honey mustard and a citrus sauce. Very tasty 


Overall, mango rabbit's drinks are okay but the chicken is SO GOOD and service is really awesome. Peggy and the other workers are so nice and will make sure to give plenty  of recommendations so you'll find a drink that you like."}
{"text":"We had gotten a restaurant.com certificate to try this boba place out, but when we got there the owner said they had never approved having their restaurant listed on the website. However, they still honored our certificate, which we really appreciated.  I got the earl gray boba milk tea, my kids got the strawberry slush and my husband got the strawberry green tea.  Everything tasted really good and really fresh.  Their drinks are not very sweet though. I got mine at 50% sweetness and could have easily upped it to 100%.  We also ordered the crispy chicken which we loved and it came with little pieces of garlic chips.  The kids loved playing on the huge teddy bear at the front of the store too.  We look forward to going back for their happy hour."}
{"text":"This is a great new place to get boba. There're a lot of options available to customize your drink and the drinks themselves taste great. The staff's cool too."}
{"text":"I had high hopes for the revival of this place but Mango Rabbit is still like the previous store Milk tea 101 poor drinks and lackluster customer service. I probably won't be back after the service & drinks we had.

- Their BOGO milk tea promo on Yelp wasn't clear. It's actually buy any drink get one Regular milk tea free...oh and in case you  missed it no boba that's an extra charge...How generous. *This isn't mentioned anywhere

- There is a cash discount...but you won't know what the exact price of what your paying is because there is no receipt. Then your cash is put in a toy register. Sketch!!

-My tea was too bitter overbrewed. The only ash I want is in my hair not in my tea!

- My friend's matcha latte ordered was supposed to be cold but it was hot on top and then cold on bottom

-Owner not friendly

I would save my time & money for other boba shops in Tempe like I-tea. Mango Rabbit we have to hop out of here! The stars are just for the cute line bears and Regular Milk Tea is not bad.

{"text":"Hidden new boba spot with fresh organic drinks! 

I tried the Snow White Mango Green Tea and Green Matcha tea both sweetened. The mango tasted like fresh blended mango \"purée\" which it is with a hint of sweetness. I'm really picky with my \"tea\" and the matcha was actually really good. It was sweetened of course, but not too much. I liked it better than the Snow White Mango Drink. 

Modern, trendy boba spot with WiFi. The owner Peggy was very attentive and welcoming!  

We also tried the spicy basil chicken and fried squid balls. The squid balls were addicting, the seasoning made me just want to eat more. The spicy basil chicken was cooked with a light batter. And not spicy in my opinion, so it'll be good for people who don't like spicy. 

The cups are super cute with a heart button stopper to take a sip from and a spot for a straw. 

Stop in for some tasty drinks!"}
{"text":"Friendly service delicious drink
I ordered fresh fruit tea on Monday?it is very delicious and the service is pretty good. I like they ask me about the sweet level and ice level to make a great beverage. I think I will come back to try other drink."}
{"text":"Decor: Cute! My kids loooved the giant teddy bear and all the mini-bears. 

Service: Super friendly, accommodating, and very hospitable. They took the time to explain the menu and offered suggestions. They were sweet enough to walk over each and every one of our drinks and food, instead of the usual calling them out at the bar.

Drinks/Food: Chicken was tasty and crispy. All of us from age 1 to age 39 enjoyed it. :) 
We love boba and are always looking for new spots in the East Valley. Coming from the Bay Area where they're on every corner, we always get excited when we hear of a new boba spot pop up. We weren't huge fans of the drinks we ordered, but I think we'll come back again to try new ones."}
{"text":"\"Can you catch a falling star without burning your hand? Can you put the sky in your mouth? Can you say to an earthquake, 'Hey, hold still for a second'? No! Such is Mango!\" ? Mango, Saturday Night Live

Met up with the child known as Amber R. for some Mango Rabbit. We got a medium Matcha Latte at 75% sweetness, a Snow White Strawberry Green Tea at 25% sweetness, another Snow White Strawberry Green Tea at 100% sweetness with boba, and one order of the basil popcorn chicken. For the most part, all our drinks were okay. It wasn't anything earth shattering but it also wasn't that terror that Milk Tea 101 use to be [Note:  This is no longer Milk Tea 101!]. I should have gotten the Earl Grey as it's my usual go-to for teas so perhaps I'll come back and try that. The boba was soft and squishy. 

As for the basil popcorn chicken, it too was okay. I tried not to compare it to that one place by ASU but it was hard. That other place has deep fried garlic that I'm addicted to. This place isn't as heavy-handed on salt on the popcorn chicken though so I appreciated that and it also came to the table fresh and hot.

For the most part, everything still looks the same but they have a nicer staff. They have games for you to play with, they still have a giant LINE bear mascot for you to take pictures with, and they have some nice tunes playing in the background. Overall, it was a-ok."}
{"text":"Wow! If I could rate more 5 stars, I totally would! Clean and really cute place! I like the big bear for their display & how you can play games in here. This place is good for friends and family!

The owner is super sweet and so kind! They are extremely friendly! Best service I've been to so far in all honesty. Owner also gave us free pie thingy I forgot the name...cause we waited for the food and drinks since we were here early. But just wanna say, I really love this place!!

Food is delicious! We tried this popcorn chicken & 3 boba drinks flavored: Sea salt caramel boba, strawberry milk boba and milk tea boba! Super yummy! Totally recommending this to friends and family! Coming by here again!"}
