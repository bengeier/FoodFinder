{"text":"So salty and so much MSG, mouth feels terrible after eating the Sliced Lamb Potato Noodle Soup"}
{"text":"Wow this stuff is so good. They have two different types of noodles, the potato noodle soup and the regular noodles, the former being their specialty. I got the chance to try both of them, and I have to say the potato noodle isn't for everyone, being really really chewy, so chewy that you have to swallow the noodle whole. If you like chewy noodles then you'll love this as much as I did. The regular noodles were also good, but I would like to talk about the soup.  I got the lamb noodle soup, but all the dishes use a similar base, which is really flavorful, and better than the other noodle stall (Sun's Kitchen) on the other side of the food court. It also  comes with some sort of sweet tea and the portions are very good for what you get. You should definitely try this place out to see if you love it or hate it.  The restaurant is located in Pacific Mall upstairs near the washrooms with the Terracotta warriors."}
{"text":"Perfect call for when I was craving some kind of soup noodle with a nice broth! This isn't like the best broth ever, since I didn't actually finish it all off but it was still better than a lot of places. It had great flavour. And while there aren't a ton of toppings (for like $7 lol), it's still adequate and you're not left with like all noodle half way through your meal.   The potato noodles were chewy and I loved the consistency. I'd definitely get it again and maybe try the spicier A1 variety! In terms of taste, the noodles pretty much tastes like regular noodles or something closer to \"Lai fun\" (Chinese noodles).    The free drink tastes overly sweet though; even something like the sweet teas they serve at hot pot would be okay. But then again, I did say free and there's some $2 drink options nearby anyway.   Overall: This will be a keeper for me in pmall!!"}
{"text":"Actually so good and worth it for food court food! Saw a massive lineup and decided I HAD to join this rush for what must be good food. I even ran back to my parents and got their orders too. We ended up ordering two lamb brisket noodle soups, and one chicken cucumber cold sesame noodles.  The portions were, surprisingly, massive (though I suppose we are relatively small eaters) for $8! The lamb broth was the real deal - it's rich from the fats, collagen, and meat, but tastes unbelievably homemade. I practically downed both bowls of soup, and wasn't that thirsty after, indicating that Potato Noodle Soup of Bai doesn't add much MSG to its products. The noodles were al dente, and there were quite a few generous cuts of meat! Definitely recommend ordering this if you're a fan of lamb. They also have plain lamb soup too, if that's what you like.  The cold sesame noodles with chicken, cucumber, and bean sprouts is DELICIOUS. The sesame sauce has a very nice kick to it, not too salty or rich. It is a bit dense though, so we prefer sharing it to even it out. The noodles come without soup, so you shee immediately that it's a real steal because its volume is practically equivalent to the lamb noodles with soup! Very filling. There's also sufficient chicken, cucumbers, and bean sprouts to go with each bite - definitely didn't skimp out on ingredients!   All dishes also come with their unique tea, some sort of sweet chrysanthemum blend. The restaurant has got every figured out operationally, as the tea is cold, making for easy and efficient serving.  Next time I come to pmall, I'm definitely revisiting this place. They've found a loyal and addicted customer in me!"}
{"text":"Always enjoy their noodle soup and pork bun :) great food and taste soooo good! My must go to place."}
{"text":"I really love this place.  I actually prefer coming to this location rather than their other location on Kennedy because the food seems to taste better.  This place displays pictures of all their dishes, so that might be helpful when deciding.  My favourite dish is the Chef's Special Cold noodle.  The chili oil that generously covers the dry noodles with fried soy beans sprinkled on top gets me every time.  I'm also a huge fan of their potato noodle soups as well.  Since it's located at the back of Pacific Mall's second level, it is might be hard to find seats to sit during peak dining hours."}
{"text":"4.5/5  Located all the way back of Pacific Mall on the second floor in a corner. We ordered the A1 spicy potato noodles. Not too spicy, but has a good kick (just perfect for me)! There was chili oil and other condiments on the station if needed.   It came with lots of noodles and decent amount of toppings with variety. The potato noodles has an interesting texture. Similar to japchae, but more chewy and slippery. Broth was flavourful but it was a tad oily.   $8.50 including tax, cash only and it comes with a drink that reminds of the sweet herbal tea that comes in a can sold in supermarkets (wong lo kat/jia duo bao).   Not bad place to grab something filling as the portions are quite generous and reasonable price!"}
{"text":"After a few minutes of ordering, we got our hot noodle soups!  They were steaming hot, which was a great thing.  They were also rather delicious too.  Of course, being a food court vendor, sometimes you can't expect too much from them (with the exception of this place called Prince BBQ), but the rice noodles here were moderately decent.  They weren't very smooth and a little rough in texture.  One thing I did like about the noodle soup was that the preserved egg was so, so good!  It tasted almost like a tea egg.  Yum!  The portion was decent too.  However, one huge downfall was that I could taste the MSG in the soup base right away.  This also meant that for the rest of the afternoon, I was really thirsty from eating lunch at this place.... :/"}
{"text":"Having the longest queue in the food court of Pacific Mall and with \"Potato\" in their name, I definitely had to check them out!  With the menu hard to see from the distance I was standing, the lady at the cashier gave me a pamphlet to read their food options. It helped so much! The lady at the cash was also taking orders and knew Cantonese, Mandarin and bits of English.  I settled my order on  A7 - Pig Intestine Potato Noodle in Soup because I haven't had pig intestine in awhile and I wanted to give the potato noodles a go! Plus, it was spicy with a chilli symbol beside it.  A7 - Pig Intestine Potato Noodle Soup has pig Intestine, potato noodles, bok choy and several other ingredients I fell in love with the chewy noodles and chewy pig intestine. I haven't had pig intestines for awhile and this bowl of noodles satisfied my love for pig intestines! The noodles were oh-so-chewy and definitely kept me wanting more.  However, there were a few ingredients in there that I didn't know what it was and it tasted odd. It was pretty tiny and tangled up with the noodles a lot, so I picked them out while eating. It was yellow, pretty stringy but had a texture to it. The taste just seemed odd to me. I believe another ingredient in there was also seaweed, which I'm okay with.  The soup was hot and yummy, but I didn't taste an ounce of spice (not surprised at this point in my life), but it still had a yummy flavour to it. It was very soothing to drink it. They also gave a lot of pig intestines that I couldn't finish it.  The tea that they gave tasted quite odd, it was super sweet and was difficult to keep drinking it. But there're tons of other drink options around in Pacific Mall you can grab from instead of drinking the tea, which was what I did.  I have not been a fan of the food in Pmall's food court, but now I'm happy to say that I've found a place to grab an actual meal in Pmall!"}
{"text":"Love love love the cold noodles here. I came here after watching Mike Chen's YouTube video from strictly dumpling and it did not disappoint. It may be a bit weird to have cold noodles when you've never tried it before but I would say give it a shot - it's super refreshing especially on a hot day. You can really taste the sesame flavours and the cucumbers add just a bit of crunch. I personally like it extra spicy so I add extra hot oil which makes it even better. The combo also comes with a sweet tea which is a nice contrast to wash it all down. Have yet to try the other dishes but they all look promising, especially the Chinese hamburger which I see a lot of people ordering"}
{"text":"Hidden gem for sure! I came here after seeing it featured in a food youtubers video. Got the Chinese burger and cold sesame noodles. Both were excellent but Chinese burger is the clear standout. It was very generously filled and crispy, with great flavor. Sesame noodles were also good, it had great flavor and for $5 it was a generous portion. If you come, you must try the burger!"}
{"text":"Our favorite take out joint at P-Mall.  Not as well known as Sun Noodle in the opposite aisle but always busy.  Their potato noodle is unique and very chewy.    Order \"little spicy\" or one star spicy - if you cannot handle the heat.  Our favorite is \"A1\" noodle on the menu.  Comes with fish balls and soya egg.  Great comfort food on a winter day.  Last stall on left aisle on 2nd floor.  Right by the lamb skewer place."}
{"text":"First time at this stall in pacific mall. I had the potato noodles and lamb belly. The broth was super tasty. Lamb belly here means a variety of organ meat and tripe. This kind of soup is right up my alley. The potato noodles are chewy similar to udon. You can't go wrong for less than $10 !!"}
{"text":"Located at the Heritage town food court of the 2nd floor of Pacific Mall. Their signature dish is their potato starch noodles. Very unique. Never had something like this before. The texture is smooth and slippery. However I like their regular beef noodle soup better and is what I order most of the time when I come here. I tried their cold noodle with chicken - not bad."}
{"text":"Their cold noodles are awesome!!!!  It's my fav noodle here, especially in hot weather!  (It was good in winter too!)  Tried other noodles in soup, but I still think the cold noodles are the best!!  All the dish comes with a drink... it's like some tea with some lemon flavour... but it's not iced lemon tea... I can't describe it.  I usually will just grab other drink from bubble tea store!!"}
{"text":"While heading to Sun's kitchen, I have spotted a big neon light sign with animated text at the far end.  They offer noodles and have the longest queue.  Those bowls of hot noodles sitting on the counter look delicious! I have their pork ribs potato noodle in soup and Chinese hamburger.  The bowl of noodles comes piping hot.  The soup is tasty.  The noodles are mixed with thin slices of bean curd.  They are delicious and I like that springy texture of the noodles.  Pork ribs are a bit dry tho. The Chinese hamburger is kind of like flatbread.  It's fried to slightly golden brown and is filled with pulled pork.  The bread is chewy and it's yummy!  Both are reasonably priced; $6.99 for the noodle and $2.99 for the hamburger.  Fast service; got my food in less than 10 min."}
{"text":"Delicious yummy noodles.  I have been here several times and today i tried the beef brisket noodles which is their most popular dish.  Noodles were wonderful as usual, however i noticed when i walk to and from the stall the strong stench of smelly armpits that seems to stick around.    At first i thought someone smelly had walked by, but then i noticed the smell every time i walked by and even thought it might be coming from the ingredients in my noodles.  Or it may be from the stall near there at the corner .. i am not sure.   Either way, i would have enjoyed my noodles more if not for the aweful smell."}
{"text":"I ordered A1 which is the Spicy POTATO NOODLE soup . (with fishballs, beef balls,  parsley, half an egg, green onions, mushroom, kale)  Also comes with a small cup of ice tea  Super impressed with this bowl of noodles. Especially for food court level this was amazingly made. Soup base was flavorful and the noodles were sooo incredibly chewy and bouncy/stretchy the way I like it.  You know that feeling you get after having a bowl of hot instant noodles or a bowl of pho as a midnight snack? That's the satisfaction I had at the end of the meal.  This little stall is located upstairs at Pacific Mall in the Heritage Town in between the stage and the men's washroom. You won't miss it. Just listen to a woman shouting out numbers and her voice will guide you to the store."}
{"text":"I've seen the bright sign around the last few times I came to Pmall, but I never actually stopped in front of the stall until today. \"Potato noodles\" sounded interesting, so I gave it a try.  I ordered the lamb slices potato noodle soup ($9.12 including tax) and it also came with a drink. The noodles were chewy and smooth, like japchae, and the dish was very flavourful. I liked the broth, though I couldn't finish it. The drink that came with the noodles seems to be some kind of honey iced tea, but there was too much honey and the drink was too sweet. If there was more tea, then I think I'd really enjoy it. The cold drink complemented the hot noodles.  Reading the yelp reviews, I think I'll the the cold noodles if I come back. I'm not a big fan of Pmall lunch food, and this place wouldn't be one of my go-to lunch spots, either."}
{"text":"I really enjoy their noodle and it is definitely a hidden gem tucked away in the dark corner of a foodcourt. TBH, if I haven't had awesome noodles at their restaurant location, I would have never noticed them in the first place. I usually go for the potato noodle, it is very chewy (in a good way) and offers a unique texture that is uncommon for Chinese soup noodles. I've tried their pork ribs and beef toppings, both are melt in your mouth tender. The soup is also extremely fragrant and flavourful, so good you almost want to drink the whole thing. All in all, great food. Not entirely sure about the sanitation but doesn't stand out as dirtier than any other Chinese food court stall."}
{"text":"Located in the Heritage Town part of Pacific Mall on the second floor, Potato Noodle Soup of Bai is as far deep as you can get inside the mall...waaay in the back.  You need to avoid all the distractions, stores, other food stalls and make a bee line here as the potato noodle soups are sooooo good and worth the long trek in the craziest that is P-mall.  Normally I avoid things are that gluten free like the plague (I need gluten baby!), however the potato noodles are outstanding with the extra chew and texture that regular noodles don't have.  They have regular and rice noodles here as well, but if you are not here often, get the potato noodles.  If you can only order one thing, get the A1 spicy potato noodles.  It comes with the potato noodles, fish/beef balls, half a boiled egg, tofu skin, seaweed, veggies and mushrooms in a spicy broth along with an iced tea drink.  The noodles are delicious, chewy like Korean japchae noodles and the spicy broth is outstanding!  Really enjoyed these noodles as I finished the entire thing to it's last drop like in the foodie movie \"Tampopo\".    Definitely recommended!"}
{"text":"This was our first time at Potato Noodle Soup of Bai.  We were at Pacific Mall for the day, so decided to go to the food court and see what looked good. This stall was located close to the back of the mall, right near the men's washrooms. I was having a look at the menu posted on the sign when the lady at the cash offered me a paper menu to look at. I wasn't sure where to eat, but to be honest this offer probably prompted me to choose her stall. When I ordered, she was hesitant and warned me that \"it's potato noodles...they're very chewy\".   We ordered two soups. I had the one with potato noodles and brisket and my husband had the one with lamb belly. They both tasted delicious. The broth was rich and well-seasoned. There was so much brisket in mine that he had to finish it for me. There were also tons of noodles, shredded soy strips, Shanghai bok choi and strips of seaweed. My husband's soup had belly, tripe and other parts of the animal. We were both really impressed and would definitely go back. The noodles are definitely chewy, but that's part of what we loved about them.  The prices were good (less than $10 each) and they also threw in an iced honey tea!"}
{"text":"Interesting texture noodles served here. Kinda chewy and soft but still good. The potato noodles were made fresh daily I believe. I got the seafood potato noodles and the broth was amazing. Extremely flavourful and not that oily. However was disappointed with the little contents inside. I was expecting an abundance of seafood items as it was called seafood noodles... But all it had was 4 shrimps. Very misleading.   Also expect a wait time when it's busy. I waited for about 15 minutes."}
{"text":"3.5 Star  If you want to train your taste buds to be ready for all those CMYE spicy wings challenge, looks no further!  If you can eat and finished the Hot version and even down the broth, you are ready for anything!  A1 Potato Noodle in Soup ($5.99) with the choice of mild, medium and hot level of spiciness, I decide on the hottest one.   I was not disappointed.  It brought tears in my eyes as I slurped down my noodles.... The potato noodle itself was chewy, slippery and a lot less doughy than the regular ones. The broth is interesting enough as it was seasoned with sesame seed and a lot of coriander. Shredded wood ear fungus and bean curd added extra texture.  Luckily, I was alone... as I drying my eyes and I know I will be back for all these different version of potato noodle soup! Sliced Lamb Noodle extra spicy please!  You can find Potato Noodle Soup of Bai inside the Heritage Centre of Pacific Mall.   Don't worry, there is a complimentary herbal drink that comes with all the noodles, you will need it!"}
{"text":"I've been meaning to try this place for a while now and I'm glad I did. The noodles are nice and chewy, which I'm indifferent about. The broth was delicious though. They also put a generous amount of duck meat in it. I think the brisket bowl would've worked even better with the broth. You also get a complimentary sweet tea, which was refreshing and worked well with the noodles. The portion size was very generous too."}
{"text":"The noodles were unlike anything I've ever tried! They are very, very chewy. As in, almost so chewy that I had to swallow them whole (so be careful feeding this to young children). However, still very delicious! (By the way, this is the location in the food court at Pacific Mall).   I got the spicy lamb potato noodles (I think). It wasn't too spicy, but had decent flavour. At under 10 dollars, the pricing was reasonable as well.   I heard that they opened up a restaurant further away. I would love to go there someday and see how it compares to this stall!"}
{"text":"yummmm!!!! I can't believe this only has 3 reviews! This is upstairs in the PMall food court, beside the stage near the boys' washrooms. It's northern Chinese (northwest region) cuisine. Mostly soup noodles.  My friend introduced me to this vendor specifically for the Sliced Lamb With Noodle In Soup (B1). He ordered it without spice and it's graciously flavourful lamb soup . Without spice, it's still delicious.  Of course I decide on the photo with red colour (A1). I couldn't help it. FYI I have a western spicy palette so when I say \"mild\" I mean mild. When Chinese people say mild, it's spicy. The soup I ordered is with fish balls, beef balls, and half an egg. On the menu it has ONE chilli pepper rating which, according to the staff, is \"mild\" and \"not that spicy\" but \"definitely tasty.\"  The noodles are chewy, slippery, not doughy, and exactly as Jen K says (lol because she describes noodles better). And plenty!! My 1-chilli-rating dish is, yes my tongue can verify, NOT MILD but perfect!!! I finished it without downing a lot of bubble tea. But IF I didn't have anything to drink, I'd still be okay. I LOVED IT. I think I'd rate it 4/10 spicy, where 5 is spicy and anything above you taste nothing but spice. Anything 7+ I start to dislike. And 4 (which is my B1 bowl) would be: I taste the spicy enough to trigger my tongue and the flavours of the soup are enhanced (not destroyed). AND DELICIOUS.  If you are okay with spicy, you can take this. Otherwise I think A2 is the same but without the spicy.  The noodles and fish balls are also delicious!! Most items are $7 each. Comes with a small cup of COLD tea... I want to say chrysanthemum but it tastes more complicated than that. It was good though."}
