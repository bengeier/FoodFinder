{"text":"Excellent food and very charming owners. Give them a try and support them as they have only been open for 3 months."}
{"text":"This was actually my first time trying Thai food. I got orange chicken with a side of rice, eggs rolls and a Thai tea. The food was delicious and I will definitely be going back again. I think what really makes this a great place other than the great food is the customer service. They are so inviting and really nice."}
{"text":"I've been going to Thai Long An weekly for four months now and each time has been great. It's a small family run restaurant with the best Thai in Phoenix. 

I can say that it's authentic since my Thai friend had a long conversation with the owner and remarked how much it's like the food from his hometown. Pad Thai is how I judge Thai places and theirs is by far the best I've ever had. The pad see ew and e-San salad are some of my other favorites. Be sure to order a Thai iced tea when you go as well!

The staff is extremely friendly, get to know your name, and the service is pretty quick. Just make sure to enjoy really spicy food or ask for a 1 or 2 (out of 5) on the scale."}
{"text":"The waiter and the food here is AMAZING!! Do yourself a favor and get the steak bowl.The desert is also to die for."}
{"text":"Love the pad Thai and green curry! Everything here is great and they are always super friendly!"}
{"text":"FOOD POISON ALERT. We ordered via Uber Eats (also NOT recommended since the restaurant does NOT read \"special instructions\"). The order was completely wrong and caused food poisoning immediately. 

We ordered Curry Chicken, Pad Thai with NO shrimp, which they disregarded. A rice dish which was wrong also. The pot stickers were horrible, the egg rolls inedible and 2 out of 3 people are sick so far.

Order was on Monday, May 29th.

Strongly urge you NOT to eat here."}
{"text":"Just finished a trip to Thailand in July and I think this is the best Thai food I have had since I left Thailand. I had the spicy basil chicken and loved it. Can't wait to come back and try something else."}
{"text":"Best Thai... I feel bad that I have betrayed Thai-E-San but the yellow curry was awesome. Disappointed that they were out of mango for the sticky rice.  Also... Caught a Wild Charizard!! This is the best spot for Pokemon hunting because it is magically located between two Poke Stops. I set up two lure modules and enhanced it with an incense and waited 10 minutes for that sucker.  Also collected plenty of ultra balls and even leveled up! I would give this a 4.5 if I was able to but because the Charizard was only at 617cp :/"}
{"text":"It's simple, I called in a order for delivery and paid for it and NEVER received it. I called the restaurant after 70 minutes and they told me it was on the way. After 90 min I called again and was put on hold for over 5 min before I hung up. After 2 hours and them having my $ 25 I decided to write it off!!! They don't care, they speak horrible English and I will never order here again! Not worth the aggravation !"}
{"text":"Started ordering take out from here a couple months ago, so far everything has tasted great and the quality is consistent.  I prefer their food to any of the other thai places in phoenix.  Super happy to have found this restaurant!!"}
{"text":"Rode our bikes up for the first time last night. Excellent and quick service. Shared the green curry and large flat rice noodles with chicken and tofu, and mango sticky rice.  Everything was delicious (level 3 spicy) and so very fresh.   The sticky rice was the best I've had. Highly recommended.  Really hope the locals support this gem for dining-in and takeout!"}
{"text":"Finally found a spot with traditional fish cakes, simply delicious! Outstanding friendly service, in clean and fanciful atmosphere."}
{"text":"Ok so here's the thing...this is my second time eating TLA, and both times I UberAte it. In my opinion, it's a risk ordering from UberEATS because I feel like orders can be half-assed.  Also, apparently I always order right before restaurants close, so they probably REALLY half-ass it. 

Obviously, I ordered #TLA a second time which means the first time my Chicken Pad Thai was tasty.  I ordered the Drunken Noodles tonight and the picture was like \"hey look I have sauce and broccoli.\" And I'm like \"dude, I'm hangryAF and that looks daaaaank.\"  I am not a Drunken Noodles connoisseur. In fact, I don't think I've ever even had it. I stick to my usual Thai dishes. However, I actually had to google whether or not this dish comes with sauce. I probably have no right to even write a review....But, there's no broccoli in here. Or sauce. (It's supposed to have sauce. The picture and google were correct.) I ordered this because of the broccoli and deceiving picture! Damn it! 

Chicken egg rolls are good. Homie's review somewhere around here was a little dramatic saying they are inedible.  Anyways, I feel a bit violated because I literally just dipped my Drunken Noodles in my egg roll sauce. But maybe if I actually eat AT the restaurant like a civilized human I'll enjoy it better and add a star.  And maybe I'll just try it again on #NationalDrunkenNoodlesDay because I'm sure that's a thing; It's bound to have broccoli and sauce on its holiday."}
{"text":"I've been here a handful of times. I enjoy the decor and the one server that is always present. The flavors are all there and the portions are on par with other Thai restaurants nearby. My last takeout was very disappointing. I got the wonton soup and the soup was  ridiculously hot, temperature wise. The wontons were soggy and mushy. Their spicy scale is way different than what I'm used to. I got a level 2 green bean and I can barely eat it because of the spiciness. Please work on your consistentcy."}
{"text":"The food here is to die for. I get the curry and it is amazing I live near heat and come at least once a weak. I hope the other neighbors are eating hear two because if they aren't they are missing out big time. I rarely see this place not busy so that says something. I am hear right know and am so happy with the food I had to post about. Come and eat here for the best Thai food around here. The owner says she brings her heritage and good god with her. Come here for great and authentic Thai food."}
{"text":"Had to check out the new Thai Long Long-An, located in the old American Taco location.
They add a very extensive menu with a great deal of options. Settled on the Pad Thai, the chicken and the vegetable. The vegetable had a good deal of fresh vegetables, large amount of noodles. The chicken was a large serving as well a few shrimp added in. Both had fresh ingredients and great flavor. On the spice meter we ordered 3 out of 5, a bit of kick but nothing too bad.  I did take out but it was nice looking inside with tables. 
The staff was very nice and seemed to genuinely care.
I look forward to returning."}
{"text":"The food is wonderful and so flavorful! I've had a variety of dishes and they have all been delicious. I love fresh herbs and veggies, and the entrees I've had really highlight those flavors. The restaurant is nice with very friendly service! Great to have this establishment in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"As a self claimed Thai aficionado, this is the freshest and most authentic Thai in the valley.  Why?  The first time I've tasted a true al dente carrot executed at this price point; not to mention the fresh ginger in the sauces... delicious!

Our go to order is the pad se ew with chicken spicy 3.  The wide noodles aren't one big glob like most places and I've already mentioned the veggies.  The chicken though is a star with white meat that's not dried out and they aren't stingy!

I recommend the vegetable spring rolls as well.  You can't go wrong here- taste the fresh ginger and enjoy Thai like it's supposed to be."}
{"text":"Just ate here for the first time! Favorite thai in Phoenix! Loved the Tom Kha and red curry!!!! Really a must try for Thai food lovers!"}
{"text":"perfect service, AMAZING food. try the fried tofu and the panang curry- they're as good as they get."}
{"text":"I love this place. The food is always good and the servers are so sweet! I'm a huge fan of the coconut soup and I believe they have the best in town!!!"}
{"text":"We're visiting from Los Angeles and decided to order from Uber Eats. Everything got delivered to us just fine. I got the extra utensils that I asked for. We ordered the Shrimp fresh rolls and Pad Thai. The fresh rolls are what we usually call Spring Rolls and the sauce was not your typical peanut-based sauce, it was more hoisin-based, otherwise the fresh rolls were as expected. The Pad Thai however, just didn't taste right. The noodles and chicken were overcooked and the sauce tasted like tart ketchup. I was really disappointed and could not take more than a couple bites."}
{"text":"New to the area and was looking for a good Thai place. It's the type of place you'd probably drive by based on the outside. But I read the excellent reviews and decided I'd give it a chance.  Excellent food! We had Pad See Eow, yellow curry and cashew chicken. Would recommend them all. And don't forget the Thai Iced coffee...so good"}
{"text":"After reading the great reviews and craving \"Amazing Thai\" I figured I would try a new place. 
It was ok. Not bad but defiantly not \"Amazing!\"
The brown rice potion was small and extra, the red curry was twisty but the curry sauce was thin and runny and it's all about the Hot Red Curry in my book. However, the chicken was good.  

I also ordered the Thai coffee I didn't realize it was almost 8pm. I called he waiter over to cancel it immediately so he goes and brings it right way!?!?
Everything I seemed to ask for he did the opposite. He was also on his phone the whole time at the table next to me while his counterpart was trying to keep up with the customers. 

Don't think I will try it again. Every one was nice and the place was a cute little joint but the food took to long and it was just OK. Not great but not bad. 

Maybe you will have a better experience."}
{"text":"I hesitate reviewing the place for fear that the lunch line will grow.  For being near downtown, the place was empty at 12:00.  Great for us who were in are in a hurry.  Decent priced lunch specials, a little slow getting out for the 5-6 people present in the restaurant, but it was good.  Had the panang curry, and it hit the spot.  Friend who is new to Thai food had the pad thai and ate the whole plate.  They have 5 heat levels and I have been told that 5 will make you sweat. I will be back, but everyone else please stay away between the hours of 11:00 AM -1:30 PM.  ;)."}
{"text":"Our first visit. The Pad Krapow with chicken was EXCELLENT - fragrant, wonderful mix of vegetables and seasoning. Ordered 3/5 on spicy level, it came about 1.5. Still delicious. Pad Thai was very different than expected...SUPER sweet. Not to our taste with this much sugar - will probably not order again. Ordered 3/5 in spicy scale and it came about 3.5. Service friendly and fast, casual and enjoyable atmosphere. We will be back to try some other menu items."}
{"text":"Dont waste your time...yuck...thai e san is excellent...just wanted to try...nice waitress poor communication skills tho...i would not b back..."}
{"text":"This place is great! It's a quaint little family restaurant. Nicki, the owner, came out and thanked us for coming in. The food is delicious too! I recommend the \"Garlic Sauce Chicken\", #39."}
{"text":"So this little thai gem is in a low key location. Patio seating is covered but looks like it would be not a great place to to dine during the summer months. The inside dining is small,...Maybe 6-8 tables. 
I had yellow curry chicken, lunch special. Food was really good, yellow curry had a sweat, thick, milky, coconut flavor with just a bit of kick.... really good!!!! Inexpensive also,... 3 meals tax and tip less than 30 bucks.
I will dine here again...."}
{"text":"I give them 5 stars for service and good food. They accommodated my request for stinkyfish fried rice, and it did not disappoint. I've been to Thailand a few times and I have a hard time paying US prices for Thai food, but I would definitely come back. We had the pad Thai, which is a must for trying out a new place, the coconut curry soup, and the egg roll (not bad), oh and the mango with sticky rice. The place is small but comfortable."}
{"text":"By far one of the best up and coming Thai restaurants in the area! Food was great and service was even better. We had the spicy basil chicken and the chicken pad Thai. It was my boyfriend's first time having Thai food and he was blown away. Few was a great server. He will be sure to take care of you from beginning to end. Make sure to get the longan sticky rice dessert it is the most unique thing I've ever eaten!"}
{"text":"Fast and affordable I love supporting small business and friendly staff!!I will be back soon it's very close from my house!!"}
{"text":"I ordered the pad-Thai vegetarian and it was pretty good. It was perfectly seasoned and delivered on time via Uber eats. I will order from them again."}
{"text":"Wow! I don't know why it took so long for us to check out the place but man oh man, it was great. We got the green curry and red curry, the pad Thai, the crab puffs. Everything is so delicious. It's the beat Thai food that I have had"}
{"text":"THE best Pad Thai!!! Super friendly staff. Huge menu. Great value. I can't wait to go back and try some of the other offerings."}
{"text":"Hands down the best Thai food in Phoenix! 

The spices are great, the meat isn't gamey, the veggies are fresh, but not only is the food delicious, the service is fantastic! Owned by a wonderful Thai family, you feel like you're in their dining room. 

Everything is great, but I highly suggest the Green Curry, Orange Chicken, and Veggie Eggrolls!"}
{"text":"We've been here 4 times in the last 3 weeks!  Love the food and the staff.  They have been very accommodating to my gluten free dietary needs which is a plus.  I highly recommend this place.  The food is bomb!"}
{"text":"I am being generous for giving this place a 3 star. I was getting ready to take a return flight to MN and figured...hey why not get some Thai before the flight. I did look around and found this place. The restaurant setting was okay and the server was nice. The food was my problem---but that should be the most important thing to consider when eating out. 

I ordered some fresh spring rolls --- came out with the noodles looking a little discolored but I overlooked it. It tasted okay I've had better. Then came out my second order of Thai style papaya salad. It looked pretty good, but the taste was a little weird. It tasted like they've added the tamarind powder or something not so fresh in ingredients. I did not like it too much. Then finally, vegetarian pad Thai. Oh dear lord it tasted horrible. I took a total of two bites and I could not continue. I ended up paying 30 plus 5 dollars tip. Money not very well spent. 

I ended up leaving and drove past by another Thai restaurant in the area. Sad."}
{"text":"Time and time again this place has been great for take-out. I love Thai Jennifer (I think that was her name, sorry if not, the main hostess/waitress) she is always there and does everything she can to please all her customers. I hope they pay her very well because she is the beautiful and sweet face of Thai Long-An! Thank you!"}
{"text":"First time and not the last time! Great food friendly service! I even started looking at flights to Thailand! The owner is amazing and super friendly!"}
{"text":"This place was clean and the food was great! I don't like a ton of spice but I love pad Thai. I asked for a 2 out of 5 on the heat scale. It was more like a 0 so I will ask for spicier next time. Service was perfect. Great lunch spot!"}
{"text":"Pretty good, fairly legit Thai food. Protip for spice chasers: a 5/5 spicy is a bit spicier than hot cheetos. If you're used to a thai restaurant that does a 1-10 scale where 10 is pet pet or pet mak, a 5/5 here would probably be a 4/10."}
{"text":"I can't stop coming because of how accommodating the owner is. They can customize certain dishes and add extra of almost anything you want. I'm hooked to their chow mien with mussels. I always ask for extra order of noodles because they are so great. My new favorite Thai place in Central Phoenix."}
{"text":"We were visiting from San Diego and stopped in based on the yelp reviews. This place is a gem. The building is dated but clean and nice. The food is great and a very good value. The food is prepared by the Thai owner and served by her son. Excellent choice!"}
{"text":"I've searched high and low for the best Thai restaurant in Phoenix and this is it! I'm never leaving!!!!!! 
The people were friendly and the food was sooooooo delicious. It took a little while to come out but I'd rather have a fresh dish than something premade. The papaya salad was perfect, and their pad Thai was honestly the best pad Thai I've ever tried."}
{"text":"Overall, my experience at Thai Long-An was outstanding. Everything was fresh and authentic. I highly recommend any of their noodle dishes or salads. The staff was attentive and very friendly. You can tell that they are passionate about sharing their culture with their customers. Prices were reasonable for the huge portions. New favorite Thai restaurant in the valley!"}
{"text":"Service is excellent, I love the red chicken curry lunch special with spice at level 1. I'm so glad they are in my neighborhood!"}
{"text":"Just average. I had this delivered and was underwhelmed for sure. You have to get basics like chicken fried rice right every time."}
{"text":"This is a great family-run spot in the Melrose district.  Met the owner and her son while enjoying very good Thai cuisine.  Don't let the unassuming exterior fool you, there is some serious traditional cooking happening inside."}
{"text":"Delicious and very fresh!  We got the fresh shrimp rolls as an appetizer. We also got the pork larb and chicken yellow curry. Everything was really good and the ingredients were super fresh.  And to top it all off, the service was fast and friendly. They did a nice job cleaning up the space from the former tenant and making it clean and bright. Exceeded my expectations, and we will be back!

A note about spice level--I'm a bit of a wimp and asked for a 2 on a 1-5 scale. My food definitely had some heat. A 3 would have been too much for me, but a 2 was just right. Err on the side of going lower than you otherwise might--they are not fooling around!"}
{"text":"I've been trying more and more Thai places lately and this one is pretty good. In fact, I'll be back to try a couple more dishes.

I ordered the Garlic Sauce Chicken and my husband ordered the Egg Fried Rice with Steak. I'm a wimp when it comes to spicy food so the #2 on the spicy chart was just perfect. My husband prefers a little spicier so I recommend a 4 or possibly 5. He found the 3 to not be spicy at all.

Our service was great! Both people who helped us were exceedingly friendly and polite. It felt like they truly cared we were there. I will say, they don't pre make food so if you are ordering take out, I suggest calling it in or you'll wait at least 20 minutes. This isn't a bad thing, just an aspect to know.

This is a newer establishment so please help this local business out if you are in the area"}
{"text":"The red curry is SO GOOOD!!! Service is amazing. It's small inside, but every time I have come it is completely full and people definitely don't mind waiting. It's so nice having a delicious Thai restaurant in the neighborhood. Try the singha beer too, light and crisp!"}
{"text":"Not authentic, it's really 2.5 stars, so I'm rounding up. I went with Uber eats for dinner tonight and with the great reviews I gave Thai Long-An a try. I ordered the chicken panang and the shrimp fresh rolls. The fresh spring rolls were delicious and I really enjoyed them, they were generous in size and the shrimp and veggies were very fresh tasting. The panang was disappointing, there was a lack of kaffir lime leaves and Thai basil and there was an odd addition of cabbage. Panang is typically bursting with flavor and this one was pretty bland and not very creamy. The cooked cabbage didn't add any flavor and just seemed like a weird combination that I wasn't expecting as I've never had a panang with cabbage in it. Maybe the other dishes are decent, but I wouldn't recommend the panang at all. If authenticity is a concern for you when it comes to Thai food I would pass on this one."}
{"text":"I've been here several times for both lunch and dinner; every time the food was very tasty and generously portioned, and the service has been phenomenal. At one time my friends asked me to choose a place for a birthday dinner gathering and this is the restaurant I chose. They all agreed after dinner that it was an excellent choice. I know they'll be returning and that's a good thing; this is one business that deserves to stay, in this building in Melrose that has seen quite a few tenant eateries come and go."}
{"text":"I ordered Uber Eats for the first time and naturally, chose a place that was a little far from home and that my lazy booty didn't want to drive to on a relaxing Friday night. Thai Long-An was the lucky winner and was a-ok! I ordered the Thai Beef Salad and Pad Thai, both had great flavor {the beef was SO tasty!} but for a salad, it barely had any lettuce and the Pad Thai wasn't super saucy + the noodles were a tad overdone. I would 100% order the Thai Beef Salad  again but maybe ask for extra lettuce. I've had better Pad Thai many other places so i'll probably stick to my regulars for that. 

All in all, I can't complain for getting a tasty, exotic hot meal delivered to my doorstep! Not sure if I will be back since we have other great places in the neighborhood but i'm definitely glad that I gave it a try!"}
{"text":"The first time I tried Thai Long-an it was a few weeks after they opened. I was excited for the new addition to Melrose restaurant options, especially since so many other dining concepts in the same spot were short-lived.

Definitely, be prepared for spice if you decide to try this place...not for those desiring a mild level of zero.  That said, the customer service is friendly and eager to please.  Also, if you have an adventurous appetite and want to journey to the spicier side of Thai be sure to order a Thai iced tea to temper the heat.

Parking lot is a bit small, but since I live in the nearby residential area I biked and had no problem.  Also, I came right after the end of the lunch special period (11am-3pm) and was the sole guest.  It was quiet with Thai music playing in the background at low volume.  A perfect respite from the traffic outside.

I usually have the Pad Thai but decided to try the appetizer sampler for more variety as a meal instead.  For $14.95 you receive 2 egg rolls, 2 chicken satay, 4 Thai toast, 4 fried dumplings, 4 fried wontons, 3 fried shrimp & 4 crab rangoons!!! That's enough for a meal for two hearty appetites or definitely leftovers!

I can't yet speak to the rest of the menu, but will definitely be back for lunch to sample the entree specials."}
{"text":"Ordered the veggie egg rolls... Delicious. Had the drunken noodles for my entree... Also delicious. Food came out fast, Service was great, place was clean, definitely will be back soon."}
{"text":"Wonderful small hole in wall place! Lots of parking , small inside so go at off times to have room!  Food was 5 stars for us at our lunch, Lets say it was good enough for me to order some for take out for dinner tonight. Had Pad Thai  at level 4 & orange chicken dish level 4 .  The coconut soup looked fantastic, our lunch came with soup of the day & fried wontons & fried egg roll along with your entree you ordered all for 8.99 at lunch!  Service was fast & wait staff was family & very nice to us! Thai tea here also but I had not yet tried it. Will be back again when I am in their neck of the woods!"}
{"text":"A very nice, family owned and operated Thai restaurant. Great for takeout!!!  Try the Thai San-E-San Salad!"}
{"text":"Thai Long-An is a wonderful, family establishment.  The food is authentic and the staff is friendly.  My wife and I stopped here for a quick dinner, she had the pad thai and I went with the green curry with salmon.  The depth of flavor in both dishes was excellent and the portions were great.  The green curry itself was rich and creamy, a little spicy and so satisfying with a bowl of white rice.  The bak-choy, carrot, eggplant and bamboo shoot were all very fresh and not over cooked at all and the salmon provided a great contrast to the normal pork and chicken.  It's obvious they pride themselves on the taste and texture of their food.  
     The service was great with our waitress Sara.  She was so friendly and made us feel very welcome.  First impressions are very big for me and she made a great one from the instant we walked in.
     I hope we can visit Thai Long-An again in the near future as the menu is fairly extensive and I imagine just as tasty."}
{"text":"Good hole in the wall establishment

Doesn't look like much from outside
Once you get in quiet little place
Authentic Thai food
Great service

Beware the spice level of some dishes will pack a punch"}
{"text":"Just tried this place for the first time and enjoyed it! I had the tofu red curry and my husband had the spicy fried rice. Overall a great new place!"}
{"text":"This is a fantastic Thai restaurant and we are devoted to such  beautiful and delicious food to go and in house"}
{"text":"The food tastes as great as it smells form 7th ave. It's no frills, but the people are sweet and the food so you need to try it!"}
{"text":"We were two people on a Sunday, in an otherwise empty restaurant. We waited over 30 minutes for a bland over-fried appetizer plate and a pad Thai so sugary it should have been a dessert. Had to remind our server twice to clean the table, she never did so we did it ourselves. Hugely disappointed in the restaurant, but also yelp, which seems to think everything is 4 stars."}
{"text":"This place is around the corner from our house, we got take out drunk noodles, egg roll, and vegetable red curry. Everything was well prepared and the food was fresh and of good quality. We will be back for sure, give them a try."}
{"text":"Wow!!!! We get there at 12:08pm. The woman there seats us and gets us menus. There was a man seated right next to us that seemed irritated because he had been waiting quite sometime. The man had got up and left and so had a few others. We asked the woman if what we heard was correct. She said yes. The cook had gone shopping for food and will not be back for at least another 30 minutes. Wow... I felt badly for her because she was the ONLY person there holding everything down. We got up and went to our favorite and best Thai place Thai E San on Indian School and 7th ave. I never write negative reviews... NEVER... But seriously... people have to work... on a weekday during lunch... if it would have been a different story if this was there first week open..."}
{"text":"I had the vegetable fried rice with eggs and tofu. It was delicious and reasonably priced!! The service was very friendly and quick. The restaurant is on the smaller side and has a simple decor, both things that I like! I would definitely go there again."}
{"text":"Just Average

We had heard that the food at Thai Long-An was excellent, so we thought we should give it a try.  Thai Long-An is a small restaurant with a pleasant staff and wallet friendly pricing. On this visit we ordered Thai Egg Rolls and Fried Won Tons for our appetizers and for our entrees we ordered the Beef Teriyaki, Chicken Teriyaki, and Thai Fried Rice.

The portion sizes at Thai Long-An  are large enough  to share and still have leftovers to take home for the next day. I just wish the food had a better taste. The Thai Egg Rolls were fresh and crispy but just kind of average. The fried wontons were lacking anything in the middle and a little on the greasy side and weren't very good,  just average.  The beef teriyaki  was flavorful and had a nice  taste, I wish I could say the same about the chicken teriyaki. I found the chicken lacking any flavor and actually to be somewhat on the dry side.  

Final result - I would probably go back and revisit however, I am not in a rush."}
{"text":"If you are looking for the best Thai food in the valley, I HIGHLY recommend this place! Order something different every time, each time seems be better than the last. LOVE this place.  Great food and great service!!"}
{"text":"I love the location of this spot on 7th Avenue (southeast corner/W Campbell)- great for picking up takeout on my way home driving north.  This time we ordered the vegetable Pad Thai (#28) and Drunken noodles (#31) with Vegetables and Tofu.  I can only describe the Pad Thai as \"spicy blank\", as it doesn't have that flavorful kick I get with Pad Thai from Thai Rama or Thai E-San (both located nearby), this dish is not my favorite and hope they rework their recipe. The Drunken Noodles however, was REALLY GOOD.  Flavorful basil-full!  I'm definitely ordering this one again.  I'm a repeat customer for this place since it's easy in/out for those days when I need to pick something up after work and don't want to cook."}
{"text":"Yay! So glad we found a new neighborhood Thai place we could get takeout from. Food was delicious and portions great for sharing. I'm sure we will quickly become regulars."}
{"text":"Tiny hole in the wall type place! I ordered red curry with tofu for take out from here today and I must say, I was impressed! I got my food right on time which was great! It's a pretty big portion too for an affordable price. It drives me crazy when places don't provide me with enough curry to meet my needs haha, but this place gives you plenty!
The curry was very good. Thick and creamy, vegetables were cut thick which I like. The chunks of tofu were a bit too large and chewy for my liking, but otherwise very delicious. I'm not sure if I'd ever dine in here, it's a little small, but I'd be happy to get take out again! I'd like to try other things from the menu. Great place to stop if you like Thai food and you are in the area!"}
{"text":"My experience was fantastic. I love Thai food and this place was no exception. The portions were large and packed with flavor. Staff was kind and attentive I'll def. Be back!!! Try the e-san salad."}
{"text":"Thai Long-An is on my list of go-back-to Thai places if I'm in the general area, and this is one of those restaurants that I really wish Yelp had a half-star option for. 3.5stars overall, as it does pale a little in comparison to some other Thai restaurants I've had around the Phoenix area.

Off of 7th avenue, this restaurant has its own parking lot, inside and outside dining, and very friendly service. It just comes down to the food, which I think veers always on the sweet side. The flavors are there, but the underlying hint of sweetness in every single dish isn't my favorite.

Tom Yum soup:
I like that there is an option to get a bowl or entire hot pot, and the pot comes with dancing flames in the middle to keep the soup hot. The flavor is good, and when I've gotten the vegetarian version, it's been heaped high with a variety of freshly chopped vegetables. Just as a sidenote, apparently the tofu version doesn't come with much veggies, which I thought was interesting.

Yellow curry:
This curry was creamy and had good flavor, but it was almost more sweet than savory. The potatoes were slightly underdone, but that could be a personal preference since I like my potatoes quite soft. I liked the heaping mound of rice that came with this curry, and it was quite a generous size.

Green curry:
Though yellow curry is usually my favorite, I gravitated more towards the green here because it was less sweet and had that nice kick to balance out the sugar. Again good flavor.

Drunken noodles:
These were okay, but I thought that the rice noodles had been a bit over cooked so that they were a little soggy and falling apart. The pork had good flavor, but I would've liked to see more sauce and savoriness in the dish itself. As you can see from the pictures, the color was quite light and gave the feeling of being somewhat bland. The carrots were also undercooked so that they were crunchy in the middle.

Mango sticky rice:
This was made very well, and it's one of the better renditions I've had. The sticky rice was cooked just right, not too soggy and not too hard. It had obviously not been sitting in the fridge for too long like at some restaurants because the rice granules weren't stuck together too much, and with the drizzle of warm coconut milk over it, it was delicious. The fresh mango accompanied it nicely, and the portion was generous for the price.

Chances are I'll be back to Thai Long-An, especially if I'm in the mood for something a little sweeter."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch with my daughter cause I was in the mood for some Thai chicken curry.   I had never heard of the place let alone been here, but my daughter had, and she said it was good.

It's a cute, small place; looks like a converted old house.   The server was friendly; albeit I couldn't understand most of what she said.   She did say she is from Thailand, and asked if we were as well.

I perused the menu.   Even though I originally came in with the idea of having the curry, I thought I would check out what else they had.   Three kinds of curry:   red, green, yellow, but I didn't want some of the veggies in the red and green, so decided on the yellow with chicken.   We did a four as far as the hotness.

Yummm.  It was delicious.   Yes, it was a bit on the hot side, but not exceedingly so.   I ate about a third of it and save the rest to take home to eat later.   Still delicious, two light meals later.  It had the right mix of creaminess (I am assuming from the coconut milk) and the onions, carrots and potatoes were perfect.   The chicken was thinly sliced in small pieces.   It didn't taste boiled (thank goodness!!!)

Definitely I would return."}
{"text":"Went with coworkers today for lunch. We had chicken pad Thai, pork pad Thai, and steak salad. The pad Thai were from lunch special and came with small soup and vegetable egg roll .  Food was pretty good. We all enjoyed it. Would come back again. It was not busy at all at noon. Hope others try it as it is pretty good."}
{"text":"Best Thai food I've had since moving here from LA, I get the pad see ew, best I've had in Phoenix. Staff is very friendly, beautiful decor and plenty of parking. They have lunch specials too."}
{"text":"Deliciousness! We tried the fresh shrimp rolls, shrimp wonton soup, shrimp pad Thai and red curry with chicken. EVERYTHING WAS DELICIOUS! It was freshly made and the veggies that were nice, crisp, fresh ones! The flavor of the the pad Thai was flavorful and not salty.  Also , the customer service was great! Super nice and friendly waiter!!!"}
{"text":"Loved it! Friendly service, great food. Been there twice since it opened. Looking forward to going back to try something new."}
{"text":"For December's International Supper Club UYE Thai Long-An was the place we picked to end the year for 2016 ISCUYE.

When I made reservations it was for a solid 12, but the day of we ballooned up to 20, I felt bad because it left just 3 tables opened for the everyone else who wanted to dine there, but Thai Long-An was easy going about the growth in our party , which I thought I was pretty cool. And they were cool with us having separate checks too! 

Again we were a party of 20, and service was great, fast and friendly, the food came out in a timely matter, which surprised me because being a bigger party it sometimes mean food will be out slower.
 
I ordered the Massaman Curry spice level 3, it was sweet, spicy, warm and delish! Next time I will order it as spice level 4, you never know heat levels of places when 1st tying it. For some in the group the dishes were spicy though, so don't go by me, I just tend to like things on the spicy side of life.The sauce was just what I was craving and it stuck to the rice perfectly, the chicken was tender and juicy, potatoes were cooked perfectly! I can't wait to go back! 

I noticed on the website that it said for parties larger than 8, there will be 18% gratuity charge added to your bill,  so when I got my bill I didn't even noticed that the 18% wasn't added , instead I looked at the total and added 5% more to it because service was great and they were good with us about the adding tables & chairs to our growing party. Man I feel like an ass because a few days later I was balancing my account because I was getting ready to leave for vacation and I noticed from the receipt I only tipped 5% total the 18% was never added !! Man!!! I need to go fix this!  

Looking forward to making Thai Long-An a regular spot!"}
{"text":"This Thai place is a hidden neighborhood gem. The meals are fantastic and made with fresh ingredients."}
{"text":"Delicious! Great lunch specials. I am obssesed with the green curry, but everything ive had is excellent. Super friendly place."}
{"text":"Really wonderful tasty food.  We get the fat rice noodles with egg and beef. We also get the red curry with vegetables and chicken.  Tried their pad thai, and it was a little too sweet for me, but I've never had any other pad thai, so I'm not sure how it should taste.  We love the family that owns this place. They are so kind and deserving, that I sincerely wish them the best. For the first time the other night they were swamped with Uber Eats drivers, so we didn't get the usual service and our noodle dish wasn't really hot...it was barely warm and it seemed to lack some of the brown sauce. I think the food is better when they're not in such a frantic rush.  So I'm concerned that they are overwhelmed sometimes with that. But if that means success for them, then I'm all for it. But I wouldn't want to not come in because of it (law of diminishing returns?)."}
{"text":"cant believe some of the reviews on here.... they must be used to getting their pad thai from TGI Fridays...

The first thing i want to say about this place is how amazing the people who work here are. Its owned by a Thai family who couldnt be more amazing. Very kind, warm and overall great people. For anyone who has traveled to Thailand they will understand what im saying in regards to Thai culture. Second, the food is very good. I swear the yellow curry tastes like the yellow curry i ate in Koh Samui. I come here every few weeks on lunch and its always great food and excellent service. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"First time there. Saturday afternoon. Food was great as well as the service. I ordered beef larb b(spice level 3) and thought it was delicious. Also ordered drunken noodles with chicken (to take home...ended up eating half of it there ). Looking forward to leftovers and returning soon!!"}
{"text":"Built out of the old and briefly run American Taco shop in Melrose, completely redone into quite a tasty little Thai place. With plenty of parking and a mildly cramped dinning area, Long An is a great place to stop for a quick lunch or get take out.

They're open 7 days a week unlike many Thai restaurants and offer a large menu with many non-Thai options as well. 

They may not be the best Thai in town, but they're a great go-to when you're feeling down on the weather and need some Lemon Grass soup as a pick-me-up. And they've got the best sweet and sour chicken that I've ever had (especially when liberally applied with their table chili sauce). 

The location can get a bit hot inside on warmer days, and its definitely not a great place for a large group, but with time that may change. They've yet to convert the front patio into much of anything so hopefully in the future we'll see some lovely patio seating or an expansion of the inside dinning area. 

Still, the restaurant is bright and inviting, service is quick and friendly, and though it may not be spicy if you're actually Thai, this place is more than hot enough for those of us that aren't."}
{"text":"When this place took over where America's was, I hoped it was going to be our new Thai spot...but we only ate there once. It was not so good. Greasy and tasted like Thai flavors out of a package, not fresh. Disappointed. Like the location!"}
{"text":"Great service, so friendly and excellent food. Portions are big, one order can be at least two meals. Don't know why I waited so long to try this place."}
{"text":"What a great little place; lovely atmosphere inside and out and charming staff. The food is so beautiful and perfectly prepared. We elected 3 (out of 5) for heat which was spicey enough for us to enjoy without regrets! I don't know enough to compare with authentic preparation, but I can report it was quite good; portions are ample and presentation is lovely."}
{"text":"Another local gem we found today, 2 days of Thai food in a row. This place was very cozy and quiet, we ordered some appetizers like the shrimp fresh rol, the fried shrimp rolls and the chicken satay and 5 of us shared it and we all loved the appetizers. 

For our entrees we ordered the papaya salad, the pad-see-ew, stir fried cashew nut, Mussamun with beef curry and pa-naeng with chicken curry and we all shared and they were all great tasting, but my favorite was the pa- naeng with chicken. 

Service was ok, could have used more water but the one time that they brought water was it. Still I enjoyed the food, the place and the kindness of the staff. 

Tip: if you can't handle heat order your dish hotness to be at 1. They go from 1 to 5 with 1. Being mild and 5 being hot and I got 2 and it was a good kick of Heet in there. Love it and will definitely come back."}
{"text":"The best food ever !!! I'm in love ! You need to try them out ! You walk in and are greeted by a very kind gentleman. He brings you water and soup while you wait for your order . But once you actually get your order you're left speechless ! It was so good !! I want to go back !"}
{"text":"Speedy, wonderful atmosphere, gracious service, generous portions, and absolutely delicious cuisine prepared with fresh ingredients and greatly apparent skill. It's also 4 blocks from my house. That's both a great and a dangerous thing!"}
{"text":"So I had dinner with some friends here tonight. I ordered the pad thai and a thai ice tea. Unfortunately the restaurant was very busy and I never got my ice tea. Maybe its the food snob in me but I was not impressed with my dinner. The noodles were mushy, there were only 2 shrimps and the flavor was just blah. The decor was sparse and the parking lot was roomy. I didnt use the restroom so I cant comment on that. I didnt get anything besides water so I cant comment on that. Overall, there are so many Thai restaurants in the Phx area that I would go elsewhere in search of something better. There has to be something better, right? Ohh. I'm not in SF anymore....shrug"}
{"text":"Thai-Long An offers a variety of options. I had ordered one of their soups. The soup is delicious! Number#17 on the menu. You can taste how fresh everything is. From the herbs and spices they incorporate to the seafood. The atmosphere is very laid back. My server provided exceptional customer service. He is quite fast and efficient. Very interactive with all the customers.  This restaurant left me with a wonderful experience. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I ordered the chicken and shrimp Pad Thai through Uber Eats. The chicken was over cooked and there were only 2 shrimp in the dish that were not fresh, texture indicates that they were previously frozen before order. Very disappointed with what I received. The reviews say that this is a great place but I'm not sure if they had a new chef today or just completely missed the mark."}
{"text":"Super quaint little mom and pop restaurant. Originally ordered take-out but then decided to have a beer and enjoy dinner. It was a little empty, but since it was a holiday I'm sure they weren't expecting to be busy. The server was super attentive and sweet, and I ordered the tom kha, as well as the pad thai, both spicy (4). Food was great! I'll definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite Thai Resturaunt authentic great food. Many choices but by far the best tom yum gai, yellow curry, bancock papaya salad....

I look forward too this every week

Sometimes I cheat and eat here twice a week

A big favorite of the uber drivers...delivery"}
{"text":"Great place to eat authentic Thai if you are into small, family owned places like me. This is a small, slightly funky down home Thai place, probably family run and authentic.  It is the authentic that is important to me, since I've spent time in Thailand and have somewhat of a working knowledge of the food (not an expert by any means, tho).
Had the pad thai with no spice which was good, and the papaya salad which was super fresh--amazing, cause every other place in Phoenix I have ordered it seems as if it had been pre-made and sitting an hour.  HOWEVER, unless you are really into hot (I am not), watch what heat level you order.  I ordered #3 level of heat, and the papaya salad was SO hot my face turned beet red.  I could eat it....but whew! I was drinking water with it like crazy.  The trick here for people who aren't into alot of heat is not to order it done by the cook, but do it yourself as they put a tray with spices on the table for you to spice up your own things if you wish.  I'm doing that next time I visit here.
Everyone at the table seemed to really like their food, and it all looked good, too.  I'd like to try some of their drunken noodles and coconut soup next time around.
Service was more than decent considering what a crowd was there (maybe 12+ of us alone), and this was a Wednesday night so who knows what it is like on weekends.  Regardless, you will be served as efficiently as they can since the food is not premade it seems and totally fresh.  I wouldn't go there when I was in a rush, because--with these Thai one owner family run places that cook each order separately and super fresh--it takes a little while for the food to come, so patience is a virtue at these sorts of restaurants.  It was, however, perfect for our table meeting with so many people chatting all night.
We all liked the place from what my tablemates said.  I know I will be back here when I can."}
{"text":"Wow I can't believe how good the reviews are on this place. Just got the pad Thai and spaghettios have more spice and flavor. Big let down."}
{"text":"Thai Long-An has a relaxed atmosphere with outstanding dishes, generous portions, and an authentic taste. The service was great, and the price was more than reasonable. I look forward to frequenting this restaurant regularly."}
{"text":"Trying out the restaurants in the neighborhood and this was very yummy. The pad Thai and spicy basil is what we ordered. Can't wait to go back"}
{"text":"Decent wine selection  @$20/bottle
Are outside, great  patio - would be amazing with music. Servers are warm and accommodating. Provided four difference chili sauces upon request. 

We went with the chicken spring rolls, peppered beef, and panang curry with chicken."}
{"text":"The spicy noodles with basil are excellent. Good flavor without being too greasy. I ordered it with beef and 3/5 spice. Perfect amount of heat. A nice burn on the lips but not ridiculously hot. This place excels with noodle entrees. 

And I recommend the sweet and sour here. It's similar to Chinese style sweet and sour, but Thai Long-An's vegetables are better with red, yellow and orange bell peppers, onions, celery, tomato, and the pork was fried expertly. It was delicious."}
{"text":"I tried this restaurant with a group of friends so we were able to try multiple dishes. All the food was fresh and delicious but the green curry and eggplant were my favorites. 

PROS: Tasty food, large menu, fresh ingredients, big portions, friendly staff

CONS: Small space can make it feel crowded with only a few people inside, need to open windows or install windows because it can get smokey and hot inside the restaurant, outdoor seating on the nice patio wasn't there yet when I went and would be a nice addition, small parking area so parking can be difficult.

OVERALL - Highly recommend but if you go with a group larger than 4, consider making a reservation because it is so small, you may not find seating."}
{"text":"We love this place! We have eaten here over 20 times and each time the food is tasty, fresh and delicious! I recommend the silver noodles and my husband always gets the duck red curry. Serving sizes are generous and it's a great takeout option too as it reheats really well. Best Thai I have tasted in Phoenix!"}
{"text":"ordered through ubereats - amazing pad thai. i usually don't like chicken but added it as a \"required\" add on. it surprised me by being super flavorful and not dry at all. i love how you can choose the spicy-ness of your dish too!"}
{"text":"Best Panang curry. Small place but obviously they know what's up in the kitchen. I have been to thai place all over the valley and the food here is at the top!!"}
{"text":"I'm sick and want soup!  And it seemed every other Thai restaurant was full. Of course they were!  It was noon and I craved for a bowl of Tom Yum and sticky rice. Since it was a new spot, it wasn't as packed, so I ordered their coconut soup and sticky rice, medium. The soup was a great blend of sour and sweet and not so hot, as some Thai restaurants make it.   It is a mom and pops place which I love and support every chance I get."}
{"text":"One of my favorite Thai places in Phx! They NEVER mess up the order and the taste of this food is just amazing! Also they are always super nice and in time with take out orders!"}
{"text":"This place came into my neighborhood a few months ago and I finally got to stop in. I went with my teen daughter, she ordered honey chicken, I ordered garlic chicken. We both subbed white rice with pad Thai noodles. The service was good it wasnt too busy, the young man that served us was nice and attentive and answered a few of my questions about the menu. Our food came fairly quick but you could tell it was fresh. My garlic chicken was very flavorful, I really enjoyed it. I tasted my daughters meal, which she loved and it was good as well. For two entrees with the sub our bill was $30 which isn't ridic but a little pricier than I expected. I will definitely visit again, the food was good!"}
{"text":"Our order came quickly and was absolutely delicious! Few, our server, catered to or every will and made the experience so much more enjoyable. Definitely will be back again for another amazing dinner!"}
{"text":"A neat little Thai spot I landed in for International Supper Club, which you should totally join. Here are some things I liked: 

Service: There were more of us than expected. So many, in fact, our clique had taken up almost every seat! Although staff initially looked overwhelmed, they busted their butts and had everything ready in a reasonable amount of time. All of this a mere two hours before closing. Splendid! 

Menu: There are several dozen entrees, and they're all flexible. You can choose a red curry, for example, but then determine which protein you'd like. Some entrees give a choice between beef, chicken, pork, or tofu (they're hella veg friendly). Others expand these options into fish, shrimp, mussels, or even octopus! I have never seen so many ways to eat these in one place! Mathematically, there's like a zillion different things you should try, so keep coming back. 

Food: I went with the garlic beef, and enjoyed it very much. The beef had a great grilled flavor, like it was fresh from a barbecue. The minced garlic was plentiful, as were the sides. I thought it needed more spice, so I took advantage of the generous condiment selection, and know I'll really crank up the heat with something else next time. 

Also, get the Thai tea. Get it! 

Value: This is inexpensive AF. Even if the entree didn't blow my mind, the prices did. A good dinner and beverage for less than 15 bucks? Groovy. It's hard to find a deal like this around Melrose. 

Overall, the verdict is that I liked this place, so naturally you should go. I'll be back quite a few times!"}
{"text":"Nikki - the owner is so sweet.  The mister and I passed through for light bites in late December.
Upon arrival, the outside may look a little squirrelly- but when I walked in - you could feel that busy restaurant - good food is being whipped up
In the back. So all was GOOD.  we had our pup with us - and Nikki was fine with us having outside with him.  It was in the high 50s which was cold for most locals, so no one was really sitting outside, but was great and perfect patio weather to us considering we were visiting in from Denver where we just had a couple inches of snow.

ABOUT THE FOOD: 
- Shrimp Rolls to start... it was ok - kind of small 
        but was a good tickle to the palate 
- Tom Yum Bowl - level 3 on spice.  Really nice heat and flavor.  We get it with rice. It was good
- Chicken Drunken noodles - light on seasoning but perfect on flavoring.   
- Chicken Larb - level 4 - not too spicy and was very good

Everything was  delicious!!

Nikki was very entertaining.  We learned that the business has been going for 2 years now.  Her pride in good food and customer service really shines through.   Glad we dropped in to try her out this trip.  We would come back to visit."}
{"text":"Amazing food and service! Best Thai food I've found so far. The owner is incredibly friendly and helpful. Homemade coconut ice cream is to die for!"}
{"text":"This place needs to get it together. They never get the order right. This is my third poor experience. We've been waiting over an hour for takeout and all we ordered was soup and chicken satay! Good grief, get it together."}
{"text":"I would definitely make the drive here from Buckeye to try more dishes. I played it safe with the padthai, one of the better ones I've tried. Small dining area makes it great for casual dining. Waiter seemed nice. Clean restaurant."}
{"text":"Thai Long-An is my favorite Thai restaurant in metro Phoenix. I love this mom-and-pop restaurant due to its authentic Thai food and friendly staff. They always remember our regular orders. I recommend the pad Thai, Thai rice and Thai chow mein with fried tofu."}
{"text":"One of the best Thai food restaurants in the valley hands down! The staff is super friendly and the food is amazing!!!"}
{"text":"Got the Chicken Panang and the portion was great size! However, I ordered the spice at 1 and it felt like a 3 or 4, it was so hot I couldn't really enjoy it. The food wasn't bad, I just didn't care for it as all the reviews below did. Oh well, now I know. Just thought I'd give the new place a shot."}
{"text":"My boyfriend who just came back from a month long trip to Thailand walks in there and said \"whoa, it smells like Thailand in here\". Nuff said."}
{"text":"I love this place. The staff is friendly and the food is great. Small cozy atmosphere with decent choice of beers and wines. If you haven't tried it you need to."}
{"text":"Best Thai I've had in two years of living in uptown! The curry is fantastic. Also, I definitely recommend the coconut soup. I'm a bit jealous of my boyfriend for his choice at the moment. Also the decor is cute and comforting, and our server was really nice."}
{"text":"I got the Tom yum soup and Red Chicken Curry. Food was okay. Soup had nice flavor, curry was okay, could have used more chicken to sauce ratio. Nothing I got excited about. I have had better of both. I will try other places first before I come back."}
{"text":"My aunt married into the family from Thailand and was the best cook I trained under. Flavors and balance were incredible. This place equals and supersede my aunts skills. Papaya salad here is a must, the soup, authentic. This place is hands down a must try."}
{"text":"This Thai restaurant is tucked in the Melrose District on 7th Ave between Camelback and Indian School. It's a cozy little hole-in-the-wall with a friendly staff and some tasty dishes. I've come here several times now and I appreciate the hospitality and the prices. Sara is a warm face. She knows my husband and my drink order (a beer and Thai iced tea), and she even reminds me if I forget! Over the course of our visits, we have tasted the Drunken Noodles, the Thai Basil, Coconut soup, wontons, and eggrolls. I would say they specialize in some dishes more than others; the Drunken Noodles were the best dish I've tasted from them so far and you can crank up the heat on spices up to level 5. We've done level 4 and thoroughly enjoyed it. Their menu is pretty diverse; I went here with a group orders ranged from whole fish to spicy papaya salad to noodle dishes. In general, Thai food is already a bargain for your money, and Thai Long-An is no exception.Their lunch specials have larger portions, are under $10, and each dish comes with rice and egg roll - score!"}
{"text":"Pretty good but you're better off driving another half mile south to Thai E San. Food lacks flavor depth big time."}
{"text":"I have never had a bad meal here.  I used to come here at least once a week because it is close to work but getting busier at work and Indian School can get bottlenecked during the lunch hour.  

This is popular for lunch, you can call ahead and have your order ready when you arrive if you are in a hurry.  They have a lot of people order for take out.  They have lunch specials but I get the entrees since I don't eat rice or egg rolls.  The curries are excellent and another favorite is the Larb.  The salmon I've had there is pretty good but it tends to be overcooked.  

I love coming to this place.  I feel like family here!"}
{"text":"Visiting from Apple valley California, love Thai and this place is delicious. I ordered the lunch drunken noodles with tofu and the tofu was perfection. It's hard to find perfectly cooked tofu. If we come back this will definitely be the place for Thai."}
{"text":"Late night dinner & service was quick & friendly. Quaint little place with a broad menu. The green curry was quite tasty. The chicken meat is of good quality & not too fatty or chewy. The vegetable stir-fry was my favorite dish as it was generous with a variety of vegetables & their brown sauce is delicious! Rice was cooked to perfection. It was a little stuffy in the restaurant. Would love to return to try new dishes next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"We had a fairly large group that dined here and Thai Long-An went out of their way to accomodate us!  

The servers... were fantastic!  They took our orders in a timely fashion and in an organized manner and (I believe) they got all of the orders correct.  That's a big plus for a large group!  They also were attentive throughout our meal, checking in with us regularly and they made sure that our water glasses never went empty.

The food... I had the Chicken Pad Thai.  It was good, but nothing that wowed me.  A little too sweet for me (and I typically go for sweeter foods).  I will opt for the Panang Curry next time.

The drinks... I ordered a Thai tea to go with my Pad Thai and that was very goodA  I would definitely order that from Thai Long-An again.

****FOUR STARS****"}
{"text":"Good food clean please best customer service definitely recommend good attentive Thai style food"}
{"text":"Ehhh I dunno about this place. I went last night with a friend, excited to try a new place but hesitant because the restaurant seemed empty. When we entered, I  was pleasantly surprised. The space didn't look like America's taco shop at all... Complete transformation. We were seated and ordered fairly quickly. I had the drunken noodles and my friend had the pad see ew.  The drunken noodles were alright, though not spicy when I requested 4 star. Additionally, the whole dish was a bit overwhelmed by fish sauce... Far more than usual. My friend's dish was terrible. We both felt it tasted like petsmart smells... Like hay. It was very unpleasant. Also, both of our dishes had some random things in it... Like random small pieces of ground meat or a different kind of noodle... Like they didn't clean their pans or serving utensils very well and other dishes got mixed into ours...not a huge deal, but certainly odd. The prices were a bit high (11$/plate), especially since the food wasn't all that awesome. I would probably pass on this place in the future."}
{"text":"Very clean and remarkable customer service. I called in a to-go order on a Sunday evening. The person on the phone was super nice and repeated my order back to ensure it was correct. At pick up, the restaurant was sparkling clean, and the girl working the front was all smiles and made sure the order was correct. Which, was a nice charge of pace from some other local restaurants. 

We had the yellow curry, pad see ew, crab wontons and the tom yum soup with chicken. I will say this, it was good, and felt cleaner and lighter than most thai restaurants. With that said, it wasn't as rich or flavorful as you would expect from thai food. Still very good and I didn't feel like I wanted to explode afterward. 

I will be back and absolutely recommend this little hidden gem!"}
{"text":"Been to many Thai restaurants this one by far had a little bit of everything.  Silver noodle soup was loaded with fresh vegetables and had me coming back the next day to try the Lemmon grass soup I brought 3 extra mouths to feed everyone left with a full belly. We love the small business appeal with the warm welcome of the family running it."}
{"text":"Ok unfortunately I have to give my experience only 2 stars. I was very excited to see a Thai restaurant open up very close to me. I always order Green Curry with chicken and veggies, it's my favorite! So if I like that I know I'll like the rest. Unfortunately I did not like it at all. Very thin/ watery. Veggies were not cooked and still hard. The flavor was not great, very bland. Let's just say I'm still hungry"}
{"text":"Amazing Tofu Green Curry! I am a regular at Wild Thaiger, but I wanted to venture out and support a recent addition near me; I think they have been open about a year.I like my food spicy so I ordered 3.5 on the 1-5 scale. It was perfect!! I had leftovers and reheating didn't take away any of the flavors. The owner came out to say hi and introduce herself; the cutest woman ever! And her son was the waiter and took great care of us. I will definitely come back again! I hope people support."}
{"text":"It is a boutique restaurant with Thai decors and I have a feeling it is more of Laotian instead of Thai of Mom and Pop operation.  Order a noodle soup (ouut diao) and fish cake (Tud mund), as well as Thai tea.  It is difficult to give a nice rating since there is very little beef inside ($10.95) soup where in Thailand it runs 25B.  Tud Mund was great ($9.95), and Thai Tea $3.00.    For a lunch by myself that set me back $30 on Saturday with so little meat in the soup, I cannot give you more than 2 stars since I know the standards in Thailand as well as here in USA.   Way over price for what I got."}
{"text":"I love this place for lunch. It is small, quiet quick and no nonsense just fabulous food and friendly service."}
{"text":"Ran by here to get some fresh rolls to go (~$6). While my mom and I were sitting and waiting, they brought out soup for both my mom and I. Since I had only placed an inexpensive order for an appetizer, I was quite impressed with the generosity of the staff! I ended up taking the soup home for my family and they loved it! 

I can't vouch for most of the menu, but from this experience alone, I'd recommend giving this place a shot. They're new but have certainly started things off on the right foot!"}
{"text":"Apparently I have left this draft review sit for a while but I came here about a year ago for a UYE. Unfortunately it was so long ago I don't remember the details but I did take notes that they had delicious food, friendly service and reasonable prices. I love Thai food so that is pretty high praise!"}
{"text":"Tried new Thai spot in the Melrose district area on 7th ave. I had the pad Thai with chicken lunch special also came with a really good soup. Very friendly and great service recommend this place. Can't wait to come back and try the dish the the waitress recommend me."}
{"text":"Really yummy. It's hard to find places who sell sticky rice and they do!! I got the laab with sticky rice, egg rolls, and tofu pad thai. It was all very very good. I will definitely come back. The server was such a sweetie."}
{"text":"Fantastic, best yellow curry and pineapple fried rice, excellent can not go wrong here"}
