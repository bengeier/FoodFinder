{"text":"Croissant breakfast sandwich combo. Croissant + ham + cheddar + eggs and a coffee. Amazing breakfast at a great price. This place has a great vibe too. I also recommend the scones."}
{"text":"The food is really good - but the service is a little awkward. The two servers just stared at our dirty plates that sat in front of us until we moved the dishes to another table. The coffee mugs are a little too big for the tables. Hope the service improves. Hard to say I'll be back when there are so many other options in the city."}
{"text":"Overpriced and lousy service. Stood at the counter this morning and tried to order some pastries. 3 employees behind the counter were chatting away to each other and ignored me, so I ended up leaving and buying from a competitor down the street (with better product and service!)

There's a lot of competition out there, so the deciding factor as to whether or not a place will remain competitive (and in business) will be customer service/experience. Sadly, this place lacks in that category. Won't be returning."}
{"text":"Came on Saturday for brunch. Had the mushroom terrine - which was fantastic, and hubby had the yoghurt parfait with fruits - also very good. Americano was spot on. 

Saw lots of delicious goodies (pastries, sandwiches, salads, etc.) on display. Next time! Will definitely return. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"So glad that Sugarloaf opened a location in this neighbourhood (with many young families looking for a place to grab breakfast/brunch or a coffee on the go)! The staff here are always friendly. My favourite is a morning deal they offer that comes with a coffee and a delicious scone (my fav being the earl grey scone). It is a bright space, kid friendly (with high chairs available) and an access door for my stroller!"}
{"text":"Just had a fantastic Valentine's Day brunch at Sugar Loaf with my family. I had the croque madame while my boys had the pancakes with root chips and fruit, both were delicious! Very refreshing to see a kids menu in a restaurant as the wee ones are often overlooked.

We also ordered the dulce de leche and nutella croissants, both were flaky and had the right balance of being sweet and savoury.  They were very tasty and I will definitely be ordering these again.

The service was quick, friendly, and attentive.  Overall this is a family friendly spot with a kids menu, indoor parking for strollers, high chairs, with very good brunch options and a variety of baked goods.  This is a great addition to the neighborhood!"}
{"text":"I went on a Sunday morning and after perusing the menu, they advised that the breakfast sandwiches were not available on the weekend. Bummer. They were around 5-6$. So I ordered the mushroom terrine with truffles which came with a side of root vegetable chips. I also ordered a coffee and a guava cheesecake. Everything tasted ok. Service was good with lots of coffee refills. My bill came to a whopping $27. 
The place was small. We were a group of 5 moms with our babies. There was one high chair but no room for strollers. It was a bit tight. 
Overall was ok however I was not blow away by the food and found it a bit pricey for the small portions."}
{"text":"I come here every morning. Reasonably priced coffee and pastries/sandwiches. The staff is extremely helpful and nice. The dining area is simple, not crowded and clean."}
{"text":"I love this neighbourhood spot. They do a few things very well on their sit-down menu, I personally love the mushroom and truffle tarine! I recommend the prix fixed option - $17 for a large brunch meal, great coffee and you can leave with one of their amazing selection of desserts. Dulche de Leche croissant, cinnamon buns, guava cheesecake, you name it. also the staff are so friendly and great service."}
{"text":"So glad to have this neighborhood space open again! And it's even BETTER than the Starbucks that was there before it. 
Great for yummy treats"}
{"text":"Had brunch here, and it was delicious. Friendly staff, great food, good coffee, nice ambiance."}
{"text":"Damn this place is cute!!!!! Absolutely adorable branding and display. Treats behind the glass looked so tasty. 

I was walking around the area looking for coffee and am usually super weary of \"hipster\" coffee joints that charge exorbitant prices for terrible coffee and a pissy attitude. 
However I saw the menu on the window and the breakfast croissant meal really caught my eye. The prices looked very reasonable for a variety of brunch goodies. 

I went inside and proceeded to wait...and wait...and wait...luckily I wasn't in a hurry but come on! There were only 3 people ahead of me and no joke I waited over 20 minutes. 

There was only one guy doing everything! He was kind, professional, and didn't seem frazzled but how is one person supposed to take orders, make change, make the drinks, prepare the food, and serve tables? I hope they were just shortstaffed that day. 

Anyway, I FINALLY ordered and the employee put my sandwich on the grill. It was premade which was kind of disappointing but at least it was cheap and big. Coffee was meh. Not the worst. Not good. My cup was very cute though! Oh when I went to pay the guy kinda looked up at me strangely from behind their \"square\" system thing and told me he would have to go downstairs for cash...what?! Who doesn't have cash?! I know I'm a millennial but come on! 
So yes, I waited again. Finally got my coffee and croissant. Way too much room in the coffee but oh well, I couldn't wait around again to ask for more. Croissant was large and I was starving. It was very very greasy but I like that. Give me all the butter please. Overall, I would go back because the food was cheap and while they were understaffed the employee was really nice and didn't act all frazzled and stressed or rude and annoyed. Just don't go if you have limited timing and can't spend 30minutes or more. 

Oh! one thing was weird! a pastry chef girl would occasionally emerge from the back and drop things off. She made NO facial expressions and didn't even clock the large group of people waiting. Maybe it's not her job to help but it seemed super weird not to even comment on the situation or acknowledge her co-worker. Maybe she was a robot."}
{"text":"Nice find on our vacation!  The continental breakfast was way more food than I could eat!  Scrambled eggs 3 strips bacon, 3 pancakes, handful of root chips AND a mixed green salad. Plus bottomless loose leaf tea.  My husband had the bacon terrine and he just loved that with his latte.  Laid back environment, only critique is that it was a bit warm with little air flow."}
{"text":"Been coming here several times a month for well over a year. Food is always delicious but service has been getting progressively worse. We will not be coming back after today. They forgot about our order, we waited for 30 minutes before anyone realized that. No real apology, they said it was a technical issue and would be fixed right away. 15 minutes later my girlfriend finally gets her breakfast. 15 more minutes and someone finally brings some food for me as well, except for it wasn't what I ordered. With so many brunch spots in the area you would think that they would care about they regular customers a little more.... wasted over an hour of my Sunday morning and had to go eat somewhere else after"}
{"text":"Totally shocked that I was able to get a fairly last minute reservation here on Mother's Day - this place truly is a hidden gem. 

The staff are lovely, the food is picturesque and delicious. We did not do the prix fixe, because everything was already reasonably priced and we weren't in the mood for a dessert. 

The only issue we encountered was the table we were sitting at was a little too small for all 3 of us to have our breakfasts, water, mimosas and coffee at the same time. We had to finish our coffees and have the cups taken away before we could eat. Otherwise - spectacular little place!"}
{"text":"Most of the highly rated brunch spots are on the west end of Toronto and having explored much of that area, wanted to see what the Queen east area had to offer.  Despite having only 14 reviews, Sugar Loaf was one of the most highly rated brunch spots in the area, so we decided to give it a try.  

Small restaurant and no line up since we arrived after 130pm.  Very simple interior designing and display area. We ordered the the black truffle & mushroom terrine and the dutch babies.  For the terrine, it is worth ordering the prix fix ($17) since you also get a well-brewed coffee and a dessert. The order turnaround time was quick. The terrine was delicious. Good texture and flavourful.  Accompanied by a small salad with a nice vinagrette and homemade chips. 

The dutch babies took a little longer, but they warned us ahead of time. It was a small portion, but boy was it delicious.  It's a mix between a crepe and a buttermilk pancake served with blueberries and strawberries.  The sweet white sauce served was a bonus. Not sure what it was exactly, but it was a fantastic side sauce."}
{"text":"One of my favourite places in the area for flakey pastries and desserts. Their brunch specials are pretty great too."}
{"text":"Pastries looked amazing--wished that I could have tried them all.  Had the a la carte brunch, which was pretty good but a little overpriced for what you got.  Coffee was OK but not quite up to the standard of its competitors which are in abundance on that stretch of Queen St. East.  But would definitely go back for the unique looking pastries and sweets."}
{"text":"Oh goodness gracious. This place was not my first choice out of a list my friends gave me but boy am I glad we came here. 

The set menu is a good bang for buck. I got the salmon bruschetta which was ok but I really enjoyed the yam round chips that it came with. My friend was not a fan of those but to each their own. 

Staff isn't overly friendly in a pretentious way. All very sweet and genuinely helpful wanting to serve. The owner (I'm guessing was the male in an apron) was hustling and bustling around - knocked my friends chair a few times. This place is narrow near the back where cash out is so that a bit annoying.

The 5 star fate was sealed when I could take home ANY dessert I wanted as part of my set meal which came in a cute mason jar!

Will definitely be back!!!!"}
{"text":"I rarely explore this side of Queen St. so i wanted to try something new! They have a great tea menu and specialty lattes. The girl working at the front was super sweet and when she found out it was my first time there she introduced their items to me with recommendations. All baked items are made in house! I ordered the guava croissant. It was definitely one of the better croissants I've had. It had a great balance between moist/richness and the flakiness of a croissant. The guava filling was a bit on the sweet side for my taste, but may be great for those who enjoy sugar. In terms of tea, I got the coconut oolong. Tasted fantastic with a milk and sugar. Extremely fragrant coconut. I wouldn't rely on it as a caffeine kick though, not that strong. Price wise the drinks are not cheap. Teas are $2.75 and specialty drinks are around $4.75. So basically Starbucks price, but I'm generally more inclined to spend money to support local businesses.

Wish I hung out in this area more often to try out the rest of the menu. They also have neat things like salad in a jar (if you return the jar you get like 15 cents back or something), a variety of desserts and cookies and house made jams. If you're in the area I highly recommend you check this place out for a light afternoon snack + drink.

Oh, they also have a breakfast special. $5 for breakfast sandwich and coffee! They also heat up your pastries/sandwiches for you."}
{"text":"I am so sad that I have to write such a bad review about this place. I used to go almost every single day but catch my words I will never ever ever go agian. I ordered the pancakes and it was cold. The waitress  proceeded to lecture me for about 5 min, The reason it was cold. I choose to get nothing and left I would never ever recommend sugar loaf to any of my friends or family ever agian. I felt alienated and incorrect as a frequent customer not sure how they could do this."}
{"text":"Came across this place while on my way to somewhere else for brunch, I decided to give it a try and was pleasantly surprised, the food was so yummy and the service was great. Staff  went above and beyond to recommend thins to do in the neighborhood, if ever in the area again I'll definitely make a stop."}
{"text":"I cannot remember how we ended up there - by chance I guess. While it looks like a patisserie from the outside, they have a couple of tables and they offer brunch.

We have classic breakfasts (eggs,bacon, sausage) but the best items are surely the Brazilian fusion items.

With the prix fixe ($17), coffee, brunch and a dessert will delight your brunch time.

If no time for brunch, everything guava is fantastic!"}
{"text":"Very nice place to have a coffee, tea, pastry, breakfast... Also good for working  as it has wifi, good size tables, quiet music and comfortable chairs. It's never too busy during weekday mornings.

The guava croissant is the best croissant I've ever had. The dulce de leche one is not my favourite though.

The selection of teas are amazing. I love that they're served in a French press. I've tried about 3 different teas and they're all really good.

They have cool combos like \"breakfast sandwich and coffee or tea for $5\" That's amazing! 

Guava Lemonade is super tasty! $2.75

I totally recommend this place."}
{"text":"Delicious little spot for brunch. Went with two friends. Friendly and attentive service. Our brunch dishes and desserts were amazing. Perfect cappuccinos as well. Will definitely return : )"}
{"text":"If you don't care about the quality of your food and just want to be seen slurping overpriced coffee this is your spot!....otherwise just walk an it east and enjoy a real Parisian breakfast!..
Nothing is like in the pictures or the description!"}
{"text":"The Good: the place looks great. It's inviting, clean and even has wall plugs for your technological needs. 
The Bad: the brunch items leave a lot to be desired. I found it hard to justify what they charge for what they deliver. Portions were small and disappointing. The root chips just don't cut it for a brunch item. You have to be able to deliver on the potatoes to call it a proper brunch. 

Service: ran out of water quickly. And was not refilled. 
We were brought the bill, waiting for several minutes before getting up to pay for our meal. That's not service. 

That being said. The people seem nice and I want them to succeed. Small changes go a long way. I'll be in again to give them another chance to wow me. Next time for coffee and a pastry. Those seem to impress people."}
{"text":"My 9 y/o daughter gives their cinnamon bun 5 stars. I give them another 5 stars for the cream filled beignet. 10 stars altogether!"}
{"text":"Recently discovered this place, and have been on several visits.

The coffee is excellent, as are the pastries--very high quality stuff, especially as far as cafes in the east end are concerned. Rooftop patio is also an awesome touch.

My only complaint is that the coxinhas are really subpar--not at all close to what a real Brazilian coxinha should taste like. Too hard--not enough fluff in the pastry.

 If they improved that, this would be in the running for best cafe in the city."}
{"text":"A hidden little gem in Riverside as Sugar Loaf can be easily missed pressed between a Subway and The Wine Rack.

A perfect place to treat someone to a birthday brunch. :-)

We walked it and the smell of baked goods and brunch fills the air. The cafe is nice, cozy and welcoming.

We placed ourselves at a table and browsed the menu to settle on a brunch entree. There is a nice variety to choose from on the menu but my eyes locked in on the mushroom & black truffle (oil) terrine. I even chose it over the bacon terrine.  You heard me right, I chose mushrooms over bacon!

The prix fixe menu is probably a great deal as you can get a hearty brunch plate, endless coffee or tea, and then you get to choose your own dessert from their great line-up of baked goods.

Service is friendly and relaxed as it should be during brunch.

The mushroom and black truffle (oil) terrine was really hearty and it looked like a thick cut slice of meatloaf. You can really smell the truffle scent permeate through the terrine and there is a generous heaping of mushrooms knitted between the brioche pudding with a poached egg to ooze all over it. It tasted like something you can make at home with a little professional chef's touch to elevate the flavours. I really enjoyed it.

My YEA decided on the croque madame and it was a double decker sandwich with piled up with ham, swiss, and a sunny-side up egg. Brioche bread had a nice crunch sound when you cut into it and wrapped up the contents of the sandwich nicely.

After a long look at the bakery area, we chose a very rich looking butter tart as the topper on the meal. The small tart was big enough for the both of us.

I surely want to come back next time and try something on their Indulge and Cocktail sections of the menu. Yum yum!"}
{"text":"Amazing place to have a unique brunch or breakfast! The owner was super nice. We had a great conversation. 
We tried the Dutch Babies and Mushroom & Black Truffle Terrine. Both so delicious! Also got croissants and heavenly good earl grey scone.
They have good tea selections. 
I would definitely come back and introduce this wonderful place to all my friends."}
{"text":"Great experience and amazing food. Found it randomly and very glad we did! We had mushroom terrine with truffle oil and bacon terrine - both were to die for. Highly recommend! Not too busy on a Saturday morning, very chill atmosphere. Will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Birthday food adventures part 1? Well, stop 1. I didn't have it til later, after ice cream. I knew I was going to be in the area, and I took to Yelp to see what was good. I came across Sugar Loaf, and took a look at their menu. I saw coconut panna cotta. We've been on a slight bit of a panna cotta kick since 0109, so I knew my mother would be interested in this. Coconut and panna cotta. That's two delicious things put together. Since it was my birthday, I figured I'd bring a treat home for the lovely lady who gave me life. 

The coconut panna cotta ($5.50) comes in a cute little jar exactly like the one they took a picture of for their online menu. The description reads, \"Coconut panna cotta, topped with passionfruit coulis and mandarin segments\". My mother enjoyed the panna cotta, but the coconut was very subtle. Had I not known it was supposed to be coconut, I would have guessed mandarin panna cotta, because that was all I could taste. 

Pretty and tasty, but certainly not what I was expecting."}
{"text":"I love the food and services here! Sugarloaf bakery provides delicious and affordable catering deals for events. I would totally order from them again. I ordered 40 cheese balls; 40 assortment of lemon poppy, Earl Grey; and cheese scones; 24 assortment of chocolate chip, carrot oat and cheese, tomato and spinach, and  blueberry muffins; and 30 chocolate chip cookies. Their services are prompt and Rinaldo was very friendly when he delivered the treats. It was one of my most hassle free experiences with a caterer ever!"}
{"text":"I really like this place. The sandwiches are delicious and the baked goods are the tops as well. They serve up great breakfast sandwiches as well. I bought a loaf of egg bread and loved it. One of my favourite places to grab a snack or a quick breakfast."}
{"text":"Went recently for snacks and the guava lemonade. The service was quick, the food was really tasty and it's got a nice feel!

The strawberry chocolate dessert was also very yummy. 

Will definitely go back again!"}
{"text":"The Sugar Loaf is a nice boutique cafe located on Queen street. My friend and I came here for a tea break :) The environment is usually quiet - great place for studying / work independently.

* CAPPUCINNO
This was very creamy and delicious! Such a cute coffee art too :) My friend ordered plain coffee + croissant, which was a better deal because they offer a combo: if you order coffee, the croissant will only be an additional $.60! FYI for those looking for a tea break location!"}
{"text":"Edit: Had to update my review...it used to be 5 stars, but today I went in and was treated rudely as well as had an absolutely terrible dry, stale cinnamon bun. Every other experience has been good though, but this no longer ranks as perfect. 


This place has outstanding baked goods and drinks. I live in the area, and wandered in randomly one day looking for a warm drink - I had no idea that I was about to consume one of the greatest flavoured lattes of my life! It was actually so good that I tasted it and said, \"Oh my GOD!\" The scones are to die for. Every drink I've had here has been a perfect 10/10. Everything I've tried has been a wi"}
{"text":"All of the sweets I've tried are outstanding. Their lunch menu is also very good and well-priced. The house-made soups are delicious. The coffee is nothing spectacular, but it's good. The atmosphere is a little boring. The brunch menus look good but I don't know because I haven't been able to try it (not for lack of effort). They serve fresh waffles, but only on weekdays. Who goes for brunch on weekdays?? Then on weekends they don't serve brunch until 10:00, even though the cafe is open earlier than that. This would be the perfect brunch spot for people with kids, but they need to serve it much earlier. I'm sure they've lost most of their coffee crowd to Dineen, so my suggestion would be to focus on drawing people in for the food. There is no other good breakfast spot in the immediate area, so they could really fill a void there. But absolutely try sugar loaf for lunch or sweets."}
{"text":"Bought a loaf of bread and muffin here. 

Quality goods so come here for nice things."}
{"text":"I don't find myself in this area often (I'm from Mississauga, so basically, never) - but I'm glad I made the trek here on a Saturday morning. Unique tasty breakfast options with delicious coffee - what's not to love? We visited around 9:30 AM, and there was only one table left! We quickly grabbed it and settled in to order - so note, if you decide to come here on a weekend morning, come early. 

Parking & Ambiance: A very modern but charming, warm atmosphere. You have the option to dine-in, or grab a pastry & coffee to-go. Pastries are organized and laid out nicely, service is with a smile, and decor is delightful and engaging. There's also street parking available right in front of the restaurant.

Food: I ordered the Guava French Toast, and my other half ordered off the Prix Fix $17 Brunch Menu (a main + dessert + drink). He ordered the Smoked Salmon Bruschetta and the Panna Cotta topped with Passion Fruit Coulis. We also ordered drinks, and an Earl Grey Scone to-go. Overall, quite tasty. We weren't a fan of the Smoked Salmon Bruschetta (a little too fishy for our liking), but the French Toast was fruity and sweet, soft, and tasty. We also really enjoyed the Earl Grey Scone - an interesting combination of flavour and fluffiness! 

This place actually has a great variety to their menu - a range of both savoury and sweet options, and really interesting pastry choices (you'll want to buy them all!). We really enjoyed our experience here, and we'll definitely be back! With tax and tip, we paid around $48."}
{"text":"Their matcha lattes are delicious! You can do some work near the windows, then upstairs is for dining. I. can't wait until summertime when their patio opens up!"}
{"text":"I am a true west ender, and have no clue about the east end. Even coming here, we got lost without Google maps. 

Located among other notable restaurants, we found this non-traditional artesian bakery, that's a fusion of Brazilian and French baking style. 

Between the two of us, we shared a prix fixe ($17), Dutch baby, and a guava Croissant. Absolutely delicious! The prix fixe was totally worth it as dishes were approx $14,and for $3 more you get coffee and dessert!  We ordered a mushroom terrine, with salad and chips as our main, and had a coconut panna cotta for dessert. The coconut panna cotta was a nice balance and helped with the tangy-ness of the clementines on top. The guava Croissant was also very good, and was very buttery and flaky. 

Definitely a brunch and bakery spot to check out!"}
{"text":"This bakery may just be the best in Toronto!
The bread is soft, the flavours are intense, and the unique menu combinations make your taste buds dance! 

The brunch was simply an amazing experience. The French toast was the softest and best I've ever tasted, the cappuccino was well rounded and expertly made, and the service was warm and welcoming. 

Places like this make me immensely happy. Not just because they make great food, but because they put their hearts into it. So thank you and if you're ever craving a pastry or brunch, keep this place in mind.

On second to thought, if you all start coming here then I'll have a harder time getting a seat on weekends . So maybe just stay away ;)"}
{"text":"I came here with my girlfriends a while back for brunch and we had a great time. We came in the last minutes of brunch on the weekend, didn't know their brunch menu ends. Luckily my server advised that the kitchen would stay open a few minutes longer for us to place our orders. Food was generous and pretty good."}
{"text":"The baked goods from Sugarloaf are superb.  We've tried the croissants, scones, puffs, cookies, and they were all really really good. I love scones and they make some of the best I've had from Toronto's numerous local bakeries. 
Their baked items are mostly between $3-4 each, which is the going rate for local artisan bakeries. 

I mostly take things to go and it's the coffee here that keeps me from sitting down and eating in.  The specialty coffees here can be good to mediocre... I think it depends on who makes it. The last cappuccino I had was rather weak, and it put a damper on my visit. 

I'd still totally recommend this place to anyone. And their brunch looks delicious."}
{"text":"Random drop in for a weekend coffee. Cozy place with good service and nice ambiance. It's a mix of French with hipster/loft vibe. Had a pumpkin latte, double chocolate croissant and carrot oat muffin. Baked goods were quite good. The latte was too mild for my tastes, but I'm not a latte fan in general. I recommend for a coffee break or working without WiFi (no WiFi here)"}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this place the first time around because Lady Marmalade had their typical lineup down the street. We were all very pleased with our experience here and so I came back a second time and also brought my girlfriends. The decor and atmosphere is bright and cheerful! I ordered their mushroom with truffle terrine which is delicious (also tried my boyfriend's bacon terrine which was also saltier and quite good). We all enjoyed their prix fixe options for $17 which includes coffee/tea, various entrees, and your choice of their pastries of mousse in a jar. Portions are hearty and the root chips are really nice when they're not over-fried (the second time I went, they were far too fried, very dark and not as tasty). It also comes with a side salad.

A great place to grab brunch and coffee with friends. Note that the place is fairly small though so don't expect to be able to sit for more than hour especially at brunch time. My friends and I were finishing up our coffees and enjoying our desserts and felt extremely pressured to wrap up quickly as the staff continued to ask us if we needed anything else or if we were ready for our bill. We hadn't even been there for just over an hour before they just brought the bill and pointedly asked if we needed a machine to pay with card. We get it, it's busy, but it is a bit annoying to not be able to finish your coffee without feeling super rushed! A recommendation to the owner - perhaps you should consider taking reservations to avoid this situation. 

Overall, the food is great and the service is generally quite good. We'll probably be back!"}
{"text":"This place is super cute and while I have only sampled a couple desserts and their amazing savoury shortbread, I have been pretty impressed and would like to come here for breakfast one day. I don't find the prices too unreasonable and since I pass by here everyday on route to and from work, I do know that they have many specials, so if you're on a budget this place won't break the bank."}
{"text":"Really awesome place!!! Delicious baked goods and scones and wonderful service!!"}
{"text":"3.5 stars... there are some good flavours here but perhaps the ones I got were stale and old.  They were pretty dry.

I arrived after a day of exploring Leslieville and walked into this spot late in the afternoon.  I know late afternoons and bakeries usually mean leftovers and sad pastries.  I saw the lone almond croissant and left that one untouched but they had a few other offerings in the mostly empty case.

Service here was ... efficient but not very friendly.  It almost felt like they were ready to call it a day in the empty cafe.  I think only the staff was there.  The place is kinda cute and it does have a large brunch menu but  I was here to bring back some treats.  I was hoping to see some butter tarts but they were completely out.  Instead, I saw some interesting Latin American pastries ... I'm always ready to try a new flavour.  

Pao del Mel - Described as a honey spice cake with dulce de leche sandwiched in between and covered in Belgian Chocolate.  I could definitely taste the spices and it strongly reminded me of gingerbread. But instead of molasses and brown sugar, it had a lighter sweeter taste that probably came from the honey.  I didnt find the cake filled with a lot of the caramelized dulce de leche because it could have used a lot to keep the cake from drying out.  I was surprised since the chocolate was drenched and covering all of it.  Perhaps this is meant to be dry to start...  definitely needed something to drink with it.  3/5

Caramel Chocolate Bar - This was different.  It was described as caramel with wafers in between and then topped with chocolate.  It was more like a love child of condensed milk caramel fudge with super hard cookies in between.  I dont think I laughed so hard when i tried to use a fork to take a piece of this bar and then had it launch across the room cause it was so hard.  This was tasty ... loved the sugary caramel but I like caramel fudge.  This is not a bar... more like a big candy bar.  You'll definite need your molars for this one.  I'm not sure how to rate this one... i like the flavours but as a bar, it definitely could use some real wafers.  3.5/5

Perhaps if I'm in the area and early in the morning, I would try this spot again but I think it's safe to say to maybe skip if it's after the lunch hours."}
{"text":"Only opened 3 days ago. They have an interesting menu. A non traditional artisanal bakery. They carry drinks that has your usual coffee and tea, but also guava Bellini,  Irish coffee and desserts are amazing. Freshly baked and something different from your conventional bakery,"}
{"text":"Drawn in by free coffee from Ritual  but stayed for the mushroom terrine brunch.  It's a nice little cafe that caters for coffee drinkers and those looking for a meal (breakfast/lunch) or snack.  

When you first walk in you see the pastry counter and a few tables don the front.  Also a small ACE bakery stand for those that need to grab a baguette.  As you walk to order there's a few more along the side and there's a quick grab fridge and dessert fridge . A menu up high behind the counter that shows you a brunch menu!  Available on weekdays! Yaaaaaassssss!

I ended up ordering a mushroom terrine because it sounded yummy and it was!  It was topped with a soft boiled egg, greens on the side and you get a choice of fruits or fries.  I decided on fruits.  Portion is a good size.

The staff are lovely.

I saw that there was a coffee croissant deal, where coffee is $0.60 when you buy coffee which is $2.40 (I think)?  Fresh croissants are available around 8 am and 1 pm otherwise they can heat it up for you.

They have guava croissants...
They have Sakura mouse...
I'm coming back.

It's a cute and comfy place.  It doesn't receive 5 Star simply because it didn't \"blow my mind\" but I like it here."}
{"text":"Sampled the brownie, it was perfect, everything you'd want in a brownie. The guava croissant was perfectly buttery with the most delicious pop of guava I've ever tasted. The tastiest croissant I've had outside France. My bf loved it so much I caught him jumping up from his seat and cheering."}
{"text":"Second time here, waited 5 mins before anyone acknowledged me. Two servers clearly made eye contact with me a couple of times but totally ignored me. Didn't help me out until (I'm assuming) manager, told them. He was busy himself helping others but the other two were just standing there walking around."}
