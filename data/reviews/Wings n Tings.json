{"text":"Mmmmm, jerk wings. Multiple flavours, using organic meat and you won't need too many napkins, as they aren't all nasty with grease.  The hilight for me though was the home made beef patty. Lots of minced meat that melted in your mouth, stuffed in to a light and flaky dough. The veggie patties were already sold out, so will have to go back and try them as well.  Don't miss this little place located in the Crossroads Market."}
{"text":"Great wings, scotch eggs and rice. The lady who runs this stand is really nice I'll be back."}
{"text":"DELICIOUS WINGS! Okay everyone in Calgary has had a horrible experience with wings before... mostly because everywhere that sells them, sells cheap, little things filled with fat or nothing at all. Wings-N-Tings is not one of those places. Their wings are big, juicy, and with such amazing flavours. You can't go wrong with their Jerk seasoning."}
