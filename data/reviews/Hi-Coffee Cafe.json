{"text":"Great place for some great coffee! Kona!!!! Was excited to finally try this place out! And they're right around the corner from me! Definitely my new fav afternoon cup of coffee spot!"}
{"text":"We stooped by this place and tried the Kona Coffee. It was great. The staff was very welcoming and service was fast. If you are from the islands you will like the treats they have to offer as well."}
{"text":"Hi Coffee Shake is awesome! Watermelon fruit blend is delicious! Staff is wonderful! If this was closer to downtown Summerlin we would be here just about everyday!"}
{"text":"A stellar cafe!!! Very classy, warm & inviting. Tammy & her staff are amazingly awesome, and just the nicest people!! I work next door & wanted to thank them for the great cups o' kona over the last several weekends. Alas, my semi-temporary gig here in lovely Henderson is now over as i will be back to work at our west-side shops in Vegas. I will greatly miss the coffee, the cafe & your faces... but i hope to visit you guys again in the not-too distant future. Mahalo!! :)"}
{"text":"Amazing service and friendly staff. Very tasty pastries and of course wonderful coffee drinks that are strong and unique. One of the best coffee shops in town!"}
{"text":"Great coffee, homemade pastries, friendly staff, and cheaper than Starbucks. What more could you ask for. I would absolutely recommend this place to anyone. Plus they serve 100% hand picked Kona coffee at a great price. The almond joy latte is my favorite as well as the blueberry white chocolate scone and pumpkin maple streusel muffin. Delicious"}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place. I ordered the macadamia nut latte. The cup was filled a little more than halfway. The server was very rude."}
{"text":"Great Hawaiian coffee.. good place to just chill.  First time here and thought to just try it out.  A bit on pricey side.. but if you love Kona coffee.  Then here is where you get your kona fix.  Overall great spot."}
{"text":"Great coffee no matter what variation! Espresso from the Americas or fair trade from Kona. What a great alternative to the corporate places. Plus super friendly service!"}
{"text":"Great place to start the day. Delicious coffee and tasty Hawaiian treats. Also the staff is very nice, friendly and welcoming. Showing the true Aloha when u walk in. 3 shots of espresso to start my day can't go wrong with 100% Kona coffee who could complain. Mahalo def going back maybe every other day."}
{"text":"HCC Shake was sooooooo delicious.  Best I have ever tasted!  Just what was needed on a hot Vegas day.  Excellent, courteous service.  Didnt get to try it, but those homemade desserts looked so good.  Gonna have to try them the next I'm there for sure! Hubby loves Kona coffee and this was the only place that serves 100% Kona coffee.  HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS PLACE!"}
{"text":"Super clean restrooms...(had to stop in there first).Very friendly staff, delicious scones. Authentic Kona Coffee.  We arrived just before closing but that didn't stop them from giving 100% excellent service. We'll make this our go to stop from now on."}
{"text":"Good ambience, good coffees and we love the Hawaiian spirit. Awesome place and good customer service"}
{"text":"Want to know what heaven tastes like?  You MUST try the Haupia Coconut Latte and the Haupia Cream Cheese Bar!  I will be coming back to try their other coffees."}
{"text":"Troy and the staff are good people, I get my daily caramel latte when I am close by.  Always good and not burnt like Starbucks. Love the Hawaiian vibe and friendliness.  Also the blueberry scones are addicting! hah"}
{"text":"Our first visit here was wonderful. We didn't know what to expect. The atmosphere is inviting with sleek modern chairs and tables with room to hang out comfortably. I enjoyed one of their lattes in blended form that was one of the specials of the day,  Lavender and vanilla. It was sweet but not overly so with a lovely flavor. We tried a delicious dessert, a cream cheese bar... Oh my, Yum. This wonderful place is close to my job so I can't wait to try some other flavors."}
{"text":"I was passing through town and stopped here because it has great reviews and isn't Starbucks. They serve legit Kona coffee and make sure to ask questions about how you want it. They definitely bring back the term \"handcrafted\" to coffee. The owner was friendly and shared about growing up in Hawaii, and why Kona coffee is different. I love when people share their \"why\" for opening a place. His passion shone.   Their breakfast sandwiches were unexpectedly amazing. The croissants tasted fresh! What coffee shop can you say that about? I'm sad that I don't live anywhere near here because this was quite likely the best non-chain coffee shop I've ever been to."}
{"text":"Love coming by here trying new things and the comforting staff. Tory and Tammy are awesome. I recommend to at least pop in and try it for yourself. P.s. Insider knowledge: The owner makes pastries fresh/home made, Delicious! Great place for my girlfriend and I to get coffee and start our day."}
{"text":"OMG!!! GUD!!!! That coconut bar and lavender iced coffee... da bomb!!! Plus it's just cute and totally made me feel like I was on an island when I walked in... all they need is a blow up pool and some sand and I'm staying all day! Thanks for something different. Much Love!!!!"}
{"text":"If you are looking for the very best of best this is the place. Always warm, welcoming and great eats.. And wonderful Kona coffee fresh brew..."}
{"text":"Free Wi-Fi great alternative to Starbux  good looking desserts, will try it the next time I'm here.  Kona coffee!!!  Kona coffee!"}
{"text":"I was looking forward to a new coffee shop. The coffee was OK and the brownie wasn't good. It was very dry, and I didn't even finish it as a result. What's worse is the young woman that was working there was rude and stuck up and couldn't bother to say thank you or anything when she was ringing up the purchase. In fact, I thought she said thank you and said your welcome. When she asked me what I said, I said your welcome and she clearly pointed out that she didn't say thank you. Now how's that for pointing out to a customer how rude you are. She did mutter a quiet thank you after that. Good way to start your new business by having someone like that work there. The owner seemed nice, but I won't be back with that rude woman working there."}
{"text":"Great service. Great Kona coffee braddah!!! Food looks great. My lil guy likes the boba. And daughter digs the Chai tea. Mahalo! Even The Rock would love this place. Your Welcome!!!!"}
{"text":"The only place other than my kitchen where I can get 100% Kona coffee and I love it! I have been in a few times and they have always been friendly with fast service."}
{"text":"Great coffees and pastries. However, prices are too high. The staff is rather slow, but friendly and polite. In general, there was an ambiguous impression."}
{"text":"Super cute spot - legit good snacks as pastries - owners are super nice . Def coming back when I'm in town. Nice place to chill and study. Grab some Hawaiian flavored bobas. I like this spot!"}
{"text":"Ok, I'm from Hawaii, but that doesn't mean I put in great reviews for all Hawaii businesses that have sprung up in Nevada, because let me tell you, some of them are not all that \"Pono\".  The staff at Hi-Coffee Cafe truly understand what that Hawaii feel is all about.  They have that \"we may not be related by blood, but I'm still going to treat you like family\" kind of attitude and appeal.  It's all about \"ohana\" and this is your opportunity to experience that island love up here in the 702.  Not only has owner Troy brought in 100% Kona Coffee (read the labels kids, most have a small percentage blend of Kona Coffee), but his selection of pastries and goodies is spot-on!  They don't just look nice, the buggahs is Onolicious!  They even serve affogato's!!!  If that isn't heaven, it's the next best thing!  And the coffee shake?!?  Nuff said!  So the next time you and your friends are out and about looking for a place to cruise, kick it, and get yourself wired on awesomeness, stop in and visit the Hi-Coffee Cafe.  And no stress, get plenty parking too."}
{"text":"Aloha HI-Coffee cafe and welcome to the 9th Island! What an awesome find for this one cup a day girl. The chill and relaxed vibe combined with a great cup of coffee can keep me coming back for more.  Over the years the process of coffee making has changed: grinding with a butt of a gun, perculator, instant, Mr. coffee maker, Krueg, French Press and now here comes the V60 Drip. I am familiar with this process as I had V60 coffee in Los Angeles. It is a must to try, you will become spoiled. Like going back to pot coffee when you own a Krueg single cup at home.   HI-Coffee uses 100% Kona coffee, not a blend. The quality of the bean matters, right? So combine quality coffee and the V60 Drip, it creates a cup of aromatic coffee that does not need cream or sugar. You can taste the quality of the beans, not to strong and not to light.  I do suggest to try the espresso. I have tried the espresso as well and it has become my favorite. When that cup of dark espresso sat in front of me,I could smell its rich aroma. It was quite heavenly and to taste it was divine.  To top it off the owner and staff are so personable. I am definitely a people person, so when I come across others who communicate with a smile it makes the experience richer. Awesome coffee place! Mahalo HI-Coffee Cafe for making Henderson your home."}
{"text":"I love coming to this place cuz they're friendly and their coffee is amazing. Its a casual little cafe and a awesome place to bring your boyfriend to eat waffles and play Pokemon."}
{"text":"It's only been my second time at this coffee shop, and I love it!! It's very clean and the employees are really nice. I'm not sure if it was the owner/manager but I was sitting down and enjoying my coffee (amazing) and he was nice to bring me a guava something pastry. (Don't remember the name but it was tasty!)"}
{"text":"Strawberry/ White chocolate scone was AMAZING!! This was also my first time having Kona coffee. I don't usually drink black coffee, but tried this black. It was so smooth and drinkable without the bitterness of regular black coffee. We have been waiting for this kind of coffee shop close to home- so excited to become a frequent visitor!!"}
{"text":"New place in Henderson ~ on Stephanie @    Very tidy inside and quite friendly staff too ~    Ordered the Ala Moana, which was discribed as almond joy like..... while it was tasty, didn't taste like an almond joy to me not coconutty enuf ~    Coffee was strong but that is to be expected as Kona Coffee is a stinger blend but really nice flavours and no bitterness thank goodness.    Check out Hi Coffee Cafe, ez in & out the pastries looked deelish but was in the market for an additional treat other than my Ala Moana frappachIno ~"}
{"text":"This is a great place to eat breakfast. It's very homie and comfortable, they do the Hawaiian vibe very well. It's a family owned place and the owner is personable, friendly, and funny. I recommend the 3-2-1 or some of their spam musubi's when they are available. Also, they have an original lineup of Lattes to choose from that are all delicious."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. Relaxed atmosphere and friendly staff. Serves multiple types of drinks such as coffee and bubble-tea. Coffee and drink selection is great."}
{"text":"Finally tried this place after eyeing it for the longest time! It's a super cute cafe with some relaxing Hawaiian music playing in the background. I tried the mac nut latte (iced). It was delicious! I'm more of an iced coffee/cold brew kind of girl but I really enjoyed this drink!   I'll definitely be back to try the other drinks on their menu!"}
{"text":"Service is good, this place get da aloha spirit! Da food is good da coffee is good too! Maybe coming here to get my son's bday cake from here."}
{"text":"The service is very friendly, the owner was super nice. Food was great we had the danish snail, croissant freshly made.   The drinks drinks are way better than Starbucks we will be going a again. New favorite place."}
{"text":"This is my first time visiting Hi-Coffee, but I heard about it from my sister before it even opened. Like how'd she even know?! Anyways, I really enjoyed my visit here. The owner Troy (I think was his name) was really inviting and friendly. Definitely gave that island feel & hospitality. He shared some of his favorite drinks with me.  Their popular drinks include their 100% Kona Coffee as well as coffee shakes that you can customize, and their speciality drinks. I decided to try their Almond Butter latte today.   Troy also allowed me to sample one of their desserts. It's this taro tart & it is to die for!!! If only this coffee shop wasn't so far away from me, I would come here more often :("}
{"text":"I have never started drinking coffee until I tried this place. Now I'm addicted and I'm  here almost every day. The staff is always nice and smiling and the owner is down to the earth. Great place to grab good quality coffee and top notch service."}
{"text":"Really great coffee. Smooth. People behind the counter are always kind and happy. I drive out of my way to get this coffee. I highly recommend it! Yes, they serve the Kona coffee from Hawaii."}
{"text":"Get Coffee Kona Coffee!! Really Good and Bold Favor!! Great coffee here..Completely annihilates the competition !! They now have Boba Tea here too,Which I'll try on my next visit."}
{"text":"Been coming here awhile... While not motivated to for the coffee but the baked goods, pretty much everything is good but their banana bread is pretty popular. I've yet to explore their newer additions so I can't comment on the boba or shave ice but it's amazing to have it available. Cold brew is top notch though."}
{"text":"Just came from here, first time in and the girl behind the counter, Alyssa I believe was her name was very friendly and helpful, we told her that it was our first time in and she was super understanding.  I ordered an Ube cupcake which is a purple Yam basically, never had it but thought-I am the dice man, I love to try new foods, lets do it and YUMMMY!       I would not have known it was yams if I was not told.     The last 2 coffee shops I went to, I didnt like so I was expecting a disaster and this was good--My ex ordered a banana smoothie which he liked, I had the chocolate mint Blended drink and it was good, though I would not label it as chocolate mint...But more of a sweet creamish flavor?      Hey that could just be my taste buds acting up, I have allergies..  :/   Will make a return trip, they also have food and I would like to try the whole menu  :)"}
{"text":"This place has always been popping up on my feed and I am so glad I finally got to try this little gem out.  Super easy to find, just of Stephanie Street from the 215, I was super eager to try out the ube desserts I've been seeing tons of Yelpers advertise. My boyfriend and I decided to get the ube cream puff, an iced Mac-Nut latte and a cup of Kona coffee (GREAT NOT TO KEEP IN MIND: 100% KONA COFFEE IS SERVED HERE AND THAT IS A BIG DEAL.)   The cream puff, OMG LEMME TELL YOU GUUUURL... TO DIE FOR. It was delicate and oh so delicious. The ube cream is something I've been craving ever since the first bite. The Mac-Nut latte was something different---it has an obscure taste, so it's either a hit or miss if you try it. I enjoyed it because I am a fan of nutty and roast-y flavors. If you haven't had 100% Kona coffee, then this is your chance to have the smoothest, most tastiest coffees of your life. You don't need cream or sugar at all!  Establishment, correct me if I am wrong but, I over heard that the pastries are made fresh everyday, so if you want the good stuff, COME EARLY.   I'm so glad that Hi-Coffee Cafe exist... I can't wait to get another ube cream puff!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick drink and pastry. They're Hawaiian specials looked good and I'll definitely be back to try the lavender latte. Had a dirty chai and blueberry scone which were great. Cool Hawaiian vibe and good music. Ample space to study too."}
{"text":"Okay confession..Been drinking coffee elsewhere since I've been spending time outside of Henderson lately. (sorry braddah Troy!)  But boy was I reminded why I stopped drinking coffee at chain places. I'm guessing people like a little coffee with their milk?? I tossed that drink after one sip. Even after a second try at another place, same thing. Anyways I said to myself, \"dammit! can't believe I wasted time and bucks!\"  Didn't want to waste my time reviewing those places, so I am just updating here, as a reminder why I appreciate the Kona coffee here at HI Coffee. You can drink it straight up black....no need to mask it. I do love they offer it made with Haupia here.. and only here.. Plus the staff is super chill and they all look normal. No offense to hipster beanie-wearing-holes-in-the-ears- baristas, my daughter is/was one.. lol. But I guess I'm just old fashioned or OLD period and prefer traditional joints.  Coffee here is legit.. Missed da Onosweetz702 stuffs though!! But the Haupia Bars made here are ono!"}
{"text":"My wife loves this place ! That awesome Hawaiian Coffee comes in such great blends that you would be hard pressed to find better coffee off the island"}
{"text":"Stopped in on a Saturday afternoon after reading the positive reviews on Yelp. The coffee was tasty and it went really well with the mochi cake. Super tasty and actually very filling!"}
{"text":"Again, based on Great Yelp reviews, we came over after we treated ourselves to a delicious Thai Restaurant lunch. It was a long work week for us and we decided to treat ourselves.  This cafe is a great recommendation by the Yelp family! Truly amazing! Anaya, the young and beautiful lady who helped us with our orders is really nice, amazing, and gave us recommendations that were on point.  We ordered an Ube bar and a Coconut bar with Cappuccino and Salted Caramel with Almond butter coffee and the combinations of these flavors are to die for.  The place is very clean and the menu selections are massive.  There are hot regular coffee, to cold and iced coffee, to Bobba drinks, and some more.  It's also a good place to lounge and relax while listening to a selection of good music while smelling the scent of brewed coffee.  I recommend this establishment to everyone! Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Love this little place!!!! I love hawaii, so anything that can get me there mentally a little bit, I'm all about! It's a super cute little coffee house,  always super clean and friendly service! The option of drinks seem endless, but everything I have tried is delicious.  Oh, and can't forget the pastries... the scones... OMG! It can be a dangerous place if trying to watch your waste line, but everyone deserves a chest day here and there!"}
{"text":"While waiting for an oil we stopped by. Coffee is awesome. We had the Ube and coconut bars they were great! My daughter  had a lime mango and vanilla shaved ice and said it was better than purple penguins, portion was larger  and cost less."}
{"text":"Coffee is absolutely delicious and they have amazing pastries to compliment their coffee. Very chill and relaxed environment with great music to add. Haven't had anything that I did not like. Certainly exceeded my expectations. My wife and I are so happy it's down the street from our house because we will probably be coming here every day. I have no doubts this please will flourish. Kinda wish this place would stay low key but I know they need business."}
{"text":"Hi-Coffee Cafe is by far my favorite coffee place! The vibe is super mellow and welcoming it is a great way to start your day. The staff is always friendly and helpful. Plus their blueberry scones are so good I could eat one everyday!! If your looking for a chill place to grab delicious coffee definitely check this place out."}
{"text":"Delicious coffee. I had a signature iced latte. It wasn't too sweet. And the flavor was just so great. I rarely find coffee that delicious. Wonderful atmosphere. The staff were so friendly. I will definitely go out of my way to come back again!"}
{"text":"Chocolate croissant is good, coffee is unremarkable.  Service is friendly but I don't like the \"leave already\" implication of telling me I'm taking my order to go before I even finish ordering.  At least pretend you're asking.  Place was practically empty anyways."}
{"text":"Finally got a chance to visit my good friends coffee. Kona coffee was absolutely delicious also the pastries was to die for. Decorations was beautiful and the staff were super friendly! We will be back to visit Troy and his staff again! Thanks Hi-CoffeeCafe!!"}
{"text":"Cute place.. came to try Ono702 coco puffs, which sadly they were sold out. 4 stars for the coffee, tried the Choco/coconut haupia latte.  1/2 star for the lack Aloha spirit.  Maybe they were tired.  \m/"}
{"text":"Love this place!! As you walk in you feel the Aloha. If you like sweets you most try their pastries but go early cause they'll run out. Blueberry scones are big and its really good and made fresh daily. If you come in and there is butter mochi buy them all! You won't be able to eat just one. Their pog smoothie is good and I could drink one everyday. If you need a quick pick me up try their cold brew. It will wake you up instantly. This is a great place to meet up with a friend or to study. The staff is friendly and personable."}
{"text":"After making three trips across town in as many weeks, I think it's safe to say I'm a fan. The \"Hi\" in their name references their Hawaiian roots, further evidenced on the menu featuring 100% Kona coffee and sweet flavors of paradise. The logo is a stylish and subtle nod too, with a coffee cup ring and the classic island outline.  My first visit, I picked the Kona. It's so dark and smooth, perfectly balanced without being too acidic or bitter. It's simple just the way it is, no need for cream, sugar, or even milk. And for bonus points, they freshly grind the beans for your cup and use a pour over method to extract the best flavor profile.  Second and third visits focused on the sweeter options, specifically the Hi Coffee Shake (a dessert in a glass, plus a kick of caffeine!) and the dreamy coconut haupia latte. I'd wake up early for that, no joke.   It wasn't til my third visit that I finally came across their baked goods, which are so good they struggle to keep them in stock! The butter mochi was described as a blueberry coffee cake but was reminiscent of a banana bread with a touch more moisture and an oddly pleasant gummy texture. The muffins looked amazing, too.  I am hoping they eventually offer cozier seating options and outdoor tables to linger and study or take advantage of the nicer weather in the non-summer months. Hi Coffee stands apart from the crowds of coffee options in the valley!"}
{"text":"Just discovered this spot in Henderson! The owner is super cool! Real 100% KONA!! I highly recommend everyone try the bacon, n cheddar scones!"}
{"text":"This would be my third time here since they've opened. Each time I came here the service has been great. I recommend the shake, it has just the right amount of sweetness. The coffee is strong and I was wired all day, that's what you get when drink Kona coffee. The prices are decent and the pastries are moist and ono.   The cafe is clean and crisp with 11 tables and 3 available outlets to charge your electronics. They play the best jams and it feels like I'm back home with all the locals hanging out here."}
{"text":"Happy to have finally tried this place out. There are surprisingly not a lot of coffee shops in Henderson other than the chain of Starbucks, so I always get excited for a coffee cafe to open up.  Restaurant had a great vibe. Nice uplifting island music, cute decorations and style, very clean, and the owners were so nice. They gave great recommendations because my sister and I loved our drinks.  There was a lot of room and seating in the cafe and the music wasn't too loud so I could see this place fitting for a quick coffee date or some longer term studying."}
{"text":"Super awesome customer service and the coffee was delicious. I highly recommend the Avocado toast. It was so good! Will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"First time here, but it was a great experience! My sister and I got the assorted tarts, coconut haupia, and green tea puffs which were delicious! I love the atmosphere and the service, Troy was friendly and helpful with the pastries especially when you want to get and try everything. Definitely not going to be our last time here. I love supporting mom and pop businesses!!"}
{"text":"Coffee was very good not sure if worth the $5 a cup they charged. I did notice that you need to be Hawaiian to be given the same level of friendliness from the owner. They weren't rude to us by any means but weren't overly friendly either as compared to when Hawaiian folks came in. Not sure if perhaps they want to cater to Islanders and not outsiders (almost like I was on the island again)."}
{"text":"Simply amazing boutique family owned coffee shop. Such high quality coffee and morning pastries. Absolutely love what they're doing. $5 for 12oz cup 100% Kona coffee as of 4/24/17. Amazing."}
{"text":"Finally a great coffee house that isn't Starbucks! Awesome \"mom and pop\" shop with great coffee options. Food was simple and delicious! Had the latte and it was perfect! Customer service was great too! Made you feel at home! Can't wait to come back! THANK YOU!"}
{"text":"Coconut Haupia Two-Ways!!! OMG!!!.....SO Onolicous!! I always wanted to come checkout Hi-Coffee Cafe. Anything Hawaii style always fan of in life and small business with local boy owner. Hell yay bra!!! The main push and driving incentive for me checkout Hi-Coffee Cafw noticing they have coconut haupia latte. Not sure would call myself coffee fanatic. I do enjoy having my latte fix two days a week. I never seen that flavor latte. I did my yelp diligent saw they also serve coconut haupia bar. Talk about two-ways. So in.........  Another reason come check out Hi-Coffee Cafe they serve desserts from OnoSweetz702. I have had some of the tarts from another store sells them. Good stuff! I thought all the pastries come from OnoSweetz702. It was my first time now yelpers. I learned that Troy the owner makes bunch of pastries in house and the haupia coconut bar is his creation. So need give well deserve shout out. I have had my share of haupia action growing up in the islands. The haupia is so so SO legit. It perfect custard texture, rich, creamy, and then add the base more cheesecake with graham crust on the bottom. The fresh coconut shaving on top. Seriously coconut haupia heaven. Pair it with the coconut haupia latte. Ridiculous good! No such thing as too much of good thing in life.   I really like the interior nice spacious, lots of places can sit, like the local style music, the main logo with all the islands and the HI-Coffe Cafe with the gold color is really nice touch, and the display cases for the desserts is awesome. The only thing is the early bird gets the best pastries. I came later in the day 1:30. It was kind of slim pickings. All you need is the coconut haupia bar. They had those still so no worries. The ube cupcakes were looking good need try them next visit."}
{"text":"So I love the food here and coffee. But a word of advice the person that makes the food shouldn't be the one to bring out the food the person that takes the order should. And it's a pretty simple reasoning too. The person that made the food doesn't know who the person that ordered the food looks like so they end up giving your order to the wrong person and giving you someone else's order and this is a pretty common issue but one that is easily fixable One way to fix t is something I think almost every food establishment does is either 1. Gives out a number to the customers. Or 2. takes a name down for the order then calls the name up. Or when you mess up you compensate the person who had to wait 20mins to get a bagel sandwich."}
{"text":"This place is great!  I went in to do some work on my computer and was pleased to see that they have a really interesting array of beverages including ices!!! Also, all of the staff were just really friendly and nice."}
{"text":"I've been meaning to check out this place since I found it here in Yelp and read great reviews about the cafe. I came here with my daughter to ask for some donations of any kind for their yearbook signing. The place was cozy, clean and not crowded. The owners were so nice to donate a box of their Haupia Cream Cheese Bars. Thank you! While waiting for the treats, I ordered one of their best selling coffees which is the Haupia Latte. It was great! I liked it that the sweetness was just right and I could really taste the flavor of the coconut. I even saved some for my husband and he liked it too.  My daughter liked their Piña Colada smoothie with bobas. We are definitely coming back to taste their other lattes & pastries."}
{"text":"Great drink/pastry options and great customer service! I just recently tried their thai tea with coffee jelly, it was life changing!!"}
{"text":"My new spot! This place is amazing the drinks the food everything is just on point ! The owner is super cool and friendly , today I had the Portuguese sausage croissant and it was sooo good will be back again tomorrow for it. Also the WiFi very fast , and just the perfect place to meet up with friends or even study. Come check it out and say Jason sent you lol."}
{"text":"Heard about this place from a co-worker. My husband and I decided to stop by on my birthday, on our way to Arizona. The place was nicely decorated and it just had a laid back feel. The staff was super friendly, and it was nice talking about home (Hawaii). My husband enjoyed their 100% Kona coffee. The long johns were good. OMG, loved the apple turnovers. And liked the custard tart. My only complaint was that they didn't have Chantilly that day, which I was craving for. But will definitely go back."}
{"text":"This was my first time here and I was very impressed!  My haupia iced coffee was delicious - strong coffee flavor, which I love.  I also got their ube and coconut tart which was also delicious!! The staff/owner is very friendly and I would highly recommend this coffee shop :)"}
{"text":"This place pleasantly surprised me. We ordered three different drinks; an iced coffee, a hot latte, and a boba drink. All three were delicious. The selection of drinks will not disappoint. One thing that I look for in coffee spots is not only the selection, but the prices. If it's just another coffee spot that's trying to be trendy by offering drinks with cool names and high prices, I'm not down with that. This place? I'm down wit it. Something else that pleasantly surprised me was the staff. The owner came out and introduced himself, while he explained the differences between \"real\" Kona coffee and the other stuff. The barista was also friendly and knowledgeable about the drinks and what they offered. Trendy coffee spots can have all those bells and whistles to get you in the door, but what do they have to keep you coming back? This place has great customer service and drinks that don't disappoint with reasonable prices. It's what's going to keep bringing me back."}
{"text":"Terrific service and drinks! The owners go out of their way to ensure customers are pleased with their selections and are really great about offering suggestions. I came here to work and loved the free wifi, comfortable tables & chairs, my chocolate haupia latte and the Hawaiian music in the background. Hope to try a breakfast croissant next time, as I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I've had Hi-Coffee bookmarked forever.  I think I waited to long to stop by.  I mainly came here for the Hawaiian treats.  Unfortunately they don't have them anymore. The display case was almost completely empty. I ended up getting a macadamia nut iced coffee and a strawberry cheese danish.  It was that or a cheese danish.  Not sure what happened that they aren't partnering with Onosweetz702 anymore but if you're a coffee shop you need a few more choices than what they had.   The girl working the counter was nice.  There was a man who seemed to be the owner sitting down on his phone.  He looked up but didn't greet or even acknowledge me when I came in, even after I said good morning.  After I ordered a regular came in and he jumped up and was talking and very friendly to them.  I didn't expect all that but a good morning or simple hello would have been nice.  The girl stopped in the middle of making my coffee and went to help them even though they were still chatting with the owner.  She could have finished my drink by the time they were ready to order.    Coffee and Danish were good but nothing to go out of your way for."}
{"text":"I love trying local coffee shops. This Hawaiian coffee shop will definitely be a return visit for me in the future.   We ordered an iced coconut latte and an almond joy latte. Both were delicious and the coffee was strong. Enough to give you that extra pep in your step that will get your through the day.   Staff was friendly and the atmosphere was super chill....music wasn't blaring too loud either. This place is a great alternative if you don't want your usual Starbucks drinks."}
{"text":"Delicious assortment of desserts and beverages! A great place to meet up with friends and catch up without the hustle and bustle of loud and busy coffee shops. It has a mellow and friendly atmosphere too and we always feel welcomed. Keep it up HI coffee Cafe!"}
{"text":"My favorite place to study off campus. It's a great place for Touro students because it's just a 5 minute drive and many Touro students study here. I always get the Kaneohe (green tea latte), which tasted great both warm and cold. The owner is always very friendly and gets to know the students and customers who come in."}
{"text":"Troy ( the owner) was so gracious and let me try his 100% kona brew! They are the only spot in Vegas you can get authentic Kona coffee!!! Support local businesses!!! They have Boba and some sweet treats too! M-F 20% off drinks 3-6 pm!"}
{"text":"Great drinks, service, atmosphere, employees, owner and food! The Kona coffee is amazing!"}
{"text":"Coffee is delicious 100% kona coffee!! Little taste of home with yummy dessert and aloha spirit!!! (Not to mention butter mochi and chichi dango) definitely a new spot to support!!! All the 9th island ohana should visit for the ono haupia!!"}
{"text":"Super friendly service and fantastic coffee! I had the choc/coco mac nut latte...YUMM!!"}
{"text":"What a beautiful place to stop for coffee and treats, while working on the computer (as they have free wifi).  I will say that having Starbucks so very close (which I don't go), their prices are quite high. They charge extra for cream, whipped cream, and other items that Starbucks does not.  I do wish that they have maybe a 'loyalty card', or some sort of coupon that maybe gives $1 off $10 purchase (that's only 10%).  I think it would bring in a ton more business ."}
{"text":"Great coffee, excellent service, nice looking place, can't beat this Hawaiian coffee place"}
{"text":"I've followed Annette's tarts all over Vegas ! All the tarts are amazing but my fav right now is the kona with cookie butter  it's a bummer though that single tarts are a bit overpriced at $3.00 each if you buy individually so buy the aloha pack or half dozen pack for a better deal. Also they should have a menu or sign of all the delicious things Ono sweetz offers. They have an ube shake here which was delicious too !"}
{"text":"Love this place, makes me miss Hawai'i. Coffee is good, food is good. I wish they had Ube donuts everyday!"}
{"text":"Aloha!!!  Absolutely love Henderson's new gem of a coffee house, HI-Coffee Cafe!!  They have 100% Kona Coffee flown in multiple times weekly! Extremely fresh and tasty! Troy and his staff are incredibly kind and hospitable. Step inside and you'll feel like you took a flight to Hawaii for a day getaway!!"}
{"text":"Been visiting this place for the past month and every time I come here they keep getting better and better. Daily coffee specials and the Hawaiian style pastries are so good. 100% Kona coffee is a hard find in Las Vegas. I would highly recommend this place for anyone to try."}
{"text":"Gf and I were greeted as soon as we walked through the door! Seems like Hi coffee is still fairly new so there wasn't a lot of people when we arrived. The girls working answered all of our questions and gave us some recommendations. I was stuck between the macadamia nut or lavender vanilla but they were out of macadamia nut syrup or something so I went with lavender. Luckily I asked them how many pumps of each went into the latte (2 pumps of each) because I like my coffee on the less sweet side. I adjusted it to be 2 pumps vanilla and 1 pump lavender and it turned out perfectly! The lavender wasn't over powering the latte and I was still able to taste it. The latte art didn't turn out as nice as I had hoped, but hey as long as the coffee is good I'm fine!  My gf ordered the iced haupia coffee... not sure whats in it but I think they said coconut. They said it was popular but I'm not a huge fan of coconut so I decided on the lavender instead. My friend said her drink was interesting, but she preferred my drink. There's a black board with specialty drinks right when you walk in. I noticed a tropical latte which had 2 pumps of banana and other stuff in it...   Hi Coffee also offers a variety of baked goods and milk tea. There's a bunch of seating and its a nice study spot."}
{"text":"Ono Sweets pastries! Bringing our Hawaiian island favorites to Vegas! Didn't have a chance to try the coffee, but I'm sure it's good! The pastries are to die for. We'll be back to try more!"}
{"text":"Da new favorite coffee shop!!!! Try the iced macadamia nut latte with almond milk!!!!"}
{"text":"Great coffee and great banana bread! The owner is super nice. I'm stoked to have a local, independent place close by!"}
{"text":"I love this place u looking to get some onolicious pastries and also drink some   100%kona cofee and listen to awesome music this is the place that you are looking for!"}
{"text":"This is by far one of the best little secrets in Vegas! The coffee is fabulous and the fresh back pastries are to die for. If you haven't already tried Hi-Coffee Cafe and I recommend you do ASAP."}
{"text":"Great place for excellent coffee and pastries,  Kona coffee is Thee Best! I am ditching the cooperate coffee mill and making this my go to coffee house"}
{"text":"What a cool place to take in a coffee and enjoy a unique treat!  We were returning home from a hike in Arizona and our normal after hike stop was closed.  No worries as Hi Coffee to the rescue!     We are enjoyed a Hi Coffee Shake and Almond Joy Frap!  They were both very unique and delicious.  I was really impressed with how good they both were.  We also enjoyed the Ube Tarts which were also way to tasty!  We got a six pack of them and it was truly not enough!      The service was very good and the young ladies working that day were super friendly!  We told them about the hike and may have turned them into fellow hikers.      The layout of the coffee shop is really nice and inviting!  Well decorated and suited for a cool hang out spot!  I truly look forward to my next stop at Hi Coffee!"}
{"text":"I simply love this place . I come here on the daily . My husband and I love there coffee! Tastes fresh and they offer so many different specialties. Plus they have one of a kind deserts ! Love! Love ! Love ! Beats Starbucks chain any day !"}
{"text":"I come here all the time to study and its great because the kona coffee is bomb, the breakfast sandwiches are great, and they have ube desserts! The owner and the staff are all so friendly and sweet.  My only complaint is that people are starting to realize how great hi coffee is and theyre taking up space. I wanted it to be a local secret forever but its becoming quite popular"}
{"text":"Came here with my wife after church. Nice and quiet, minimalistic coffee shop with plenty of space inside. It looks like a perfect place to study or read a book while sipping on a latte. They also have plenty of plugs to charge your laptops and cellphones.   Got their cold brew and caffe latte, and they were both really good and flavorful. They serve Kona coffee here so we were happy about that. We also tried their homemade apple cinnamon scone, and it was light and fluffy.  If we're ever in the area and want a Kona coffee fix, we will probably be back."}
{"text":"Amazing customer service, drinks, and authentic Hawaiian pastry. Love it . They have cake pop, fun flavored scones. The owner is great very hospitable. Welcoming environment."}
{"text":"we just stopped in here after reading all the amazing reviews on yelp, and they did not disappoint! fantastic customer service, super clean inside, and the coffee is absolutely fantastic! will definitely be returning (:"}
{"text":"Saw this place on Yelp a while back but never had the chance to stop by until today because I was in the area. When I walked in the first thing I noticed was how nice the interior was. It was very modern, cozy, and of course had that Hawaii feel to it.   The barista greeted me and recommended me to the little board they had in front with some specialty lattes on it. Was stuck between getting regular coffee or a latte, but I ended up getting the Lavender Vanilla Latte (didn't snap a pic) with soy since they were about the same price (Kona coffee can get expensive).  The barista was really nice and I talked to her a little about Hawaii while she made my drink. She was quick and made it just the right temperature to where I could enjoy and drink it right away and it was delicious! Wasn't too sweet or overpowering with flavors like some places and was a nice pick-me-up for the day. Would like to go back again soon to try something new!"}
{"text":"I stopped here during a bike ride so I didn't get a good enough feel for the Cafe to write a thrilling review. Lol. I will say this, it's a cute shop with a cool Hawaii vibe. I really enjoyed the vanilla macadamia nut coffee... I will definitely return to try some of the pastries and bring my kids in to try some of the other drinks and treats!"}
{"text":"My first visit was just ok. Things they can improve on.  1. Lets boost up the decor, yea it's a Hawaiian coffee shop, but step up the decor a few notches. I'm not impressed by the burlap bag on the wall from Kona, Hawaii. The place needs more \"Aloha\" in the atmosphere.  2. My coffee was cold when I got it, lets heat up the mugs so the coffee is warmer a little longer.  Also a plain clear glass mug? Lets get some island flavor in the presentation.  3. Maybe my palate is not capable of recognizing what Kona coffee is all about, but it was cold and odd tasting to me. I also added Hazelnut flavor and it didn't taste right.  4. Bacon, cheese scone was good, but maybe offer to heat it up a little? Is that even an option? I didn't see a microwave oven and didn't ask, but at least have it as an option.  5. Free WiFi, but maybe post a small sign with the password on it so a customer doesn't have to ask.  Wifi password is   hicoffee90   so you don't have to ask. Your welcome. :-)  6. My table top was just cleaned, but make sure it's dry so a guest doesn't have a drippy table when they sit down.  7. Yes, there is pastries to snack on, but a few simple breakfast sandwiches would help get return visits? I'd like to have something nice to eat, something Hawaiian style?   A light early morning coffee and pastry, good. Lunch time coffee and more pastry? no. Later up to 7PM coffee and something else to eat other than a day old baked good? no.  I'll be back, but give me a good reason to come back, please.  Aloha and good luck."}
{"text":"Love the new coffee shop on the other side of town. Coffee =a happy costumer. So glad I can finally get my onosweet favorites in one place and pair it up with all kinds of latte, teas and shakes."}
{"text":"Super friendly owners and employees! This was my first time here and I loved it.   The unique Hawaiian treats were delicious. And the house baked European pastries were perfect.   The lattes were pretty good. Definitely better than Starbucks. Latte prices seemed a bit steep though.   Looking forward to trying their Kona Cold Brew next time!"}
{"text":"Went for breakfast and coffee, got the banana latte and a breakfast sandwich on a bagel. The coffee was delicious however the breakfast sandwich was nothing special. I did think that all the coffee was made with Kona coffee but it is only the pour over so if you want Kona make sure you order that."}
{"text":"I came to this coffee shop when I found that other students were flocking over here. The staff was incredibly friendly and offered a few suggestions for my first time there. I tried the coconut latte with some added sweetness since I mentioned that I usually drink super sweet stuff. I also got the chorizo quiche as a little snack. Great coffee and food and I definitely want to come back to try more of what they have to offer!"}
{"text":"Must update my review because afterward, there are so many pastries selection to go along with the addicting haupia latte.  I feel like a kid walking into a candy shop...my goodness! The haupia cream cheese bar is so divine...writing this review makes me wanna do a pit stop at HI-Coffee before going to work tomorrow morning.  All the pastries I had there are delicious (Haupia cream cheese bar, ube tarts, variety of coco puffs, guava danish, ube cupcakes, and so many more), all from OnoSweetz702.  But as I noted earlier in the review...the Haupia Latte.  My oh my it is unique and addicting.  I would get one every day if I could, but won't be good for my 9 month old since I am still nursing her.  I am so glad this coffee shop is so close.  And yes, staff is friendly and owner Troy is very friendly and down to earth.  Will always return for more haupia everything!"}
{"text":"Wow! Best coffee ever! Also everyone should try the coffee/chocolate tarts, the donut, coco puffs and pretty much everything in the bakery case.  Amazing!"}
{"text":"I love this coffee shop. The employees are always smiling and welcoming. They have so many options- and everything I have tried is amazing. Registering your phone for benefits is definitely worthwhile. I have nothing but good things to say about the vibes of this place. Thanks for great customer service!"}
{"text":"I really like this Hawaiian cafe!! This place smells so nice and the ambiance is relaxing. I could stay here for hours reading and working with my computer. Their desserts look so beautiful and delicious in the showcase. I had chai tea latte. Would've been nice if it was a little less milk and more tea.  Great tasting coffee and tea. Can't wait to come back!!"}
{"text":"I really liked the coffee and the guava danish. Wow! This is a place of impeccable product. The service by the young girl (who also looks very Hawaiian) at the front was amazing.  Super patient and knowledgeable.  No lie.  The only reason for a deduction of a star is that the other lady who came out before I left was a bit not so nice, it seemed, (didn't greet or say goodbye, either, unlike the Hawaiian girl), AND, this really is not a comfortable or conducive place to hang out and study.  None of the tables and chairs looked too comfy.  Give them time."}
{"text":"There is definitely an island vibe in this spot. It's quiet, subtle, but the scents will grab you instantly. They have an awesome gourmet island coffee menu.  I got a POG smoothie. Yep you read that right P O G SMOOTHIE. Yes it was as amazing as it sounds.   The wife got the white chocolate lavender drink.  They make their own pastries in house as well. One UBE and one PINEAPPLE UPSIDE DOWN cake today.   The service was friendly, quick, and with a welcoming smile. Maybe it's the ALOHA or maybe it's the fragrance of coffee, either way this spot will be frequented on a more regular basis for sure. Stop by, enjoy the wifi and do your homework or research."}
{"text":"I am so happy we stopped here for caffeine and sugar hit before our fun night out.  The coffee is amazing, my idea of perfect coffee.  The coconut cake was heaven, the most perfect white cake, creamy filling oh my gosh like amazing perfect heaven.... Hope this can be a new hit the town tradition from now on! Oh and the SWEETEST girl who made or coffee was totally the sweetest."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. I stayed with my friend almost to closing and one of the owners (I can't remember his name - think it's Tony! Sorry if I got it wrong!!) was talking and joking with us. It's such a chill and comfortable place with amazing coffee and delicious homemade snacks. This place is really down to earth, I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Great coffee and pastries. Wonderful staff and warm atmosphere. Definitely served with the Aloha Spirit."}
{"text":"My absolute favorite place in Las Vegas for coffee! Nothing compares to their Kona coffee! Makes me feel like I'm back in Maui. Everyone is extremely warm and accommodating. My two favorites are the Kona Cold Brew and the Mokka Leia (spelling) which includes hints of banana and chocolate. Wish there was a Summerlin location, that's how much I love this place!"}
{"text":"Quickly became my favorite cafe. Love the chill environment, great service, music selection, delectable selection of pastries, coffee and tea. You can't beat this place. Only wish I had discovered it sooner."}
{"text":"This is by far one of my favorite coffee spots. The people that work here are always so sweet and make me feel welcome. I'm sitting here now enjoying a guava/cheese strudel. It didn't take too much convincing. It looked delicious. Of course my usual 100% Kona Coffee with steamed milk is always on hand. You don't even have to sweeten it. So glad this place is here."}
{"text":"Excellent coffee! Nice atmosphere.  100% Kona coffee  Small breakfast menu and pastries daily"}
{"text":"Coffee is good, service is lacking. They were out of macadamia nut syrup which was disappointing for a Hawaiian coffee shop. The gal behind the front wasn't interested in answering my questions. And after ordering a pastry, she went off to tinker with the radio without grabbing it from the case.... but the cappuccino was tasty."}
{"text":"Nice people, Extremely Plain Jane, at least put a TV up or some Hawaiian Pictures...Price was OK, but some of the stuff I did not know much of...(Pastries and some of their flavored Drinks)...Hours of operation should be 6am to 10pm....Décor was very very ho hum....I could go back, but why?....It's Plain Jane...It has nothing telling me it was great and I want to come back....Hope you do well in your business!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite coffee shops in the Las Vegas Valley. And very close and convenient to my work. It has a nice atmosphere, and the barista who is usually there Amy is always so friendly; and helps you if you need help picking a drink.        I've been here a few times or so now and one of my favorites now has to be the Waimea, a chocolate/coconut latte. I'd recommend this place to anybody who loves coffee and likes some good Kona."}
{"text":"The chocolate mochi is AMAZING! Need to come back and try the green tea and ube CHEESECAKE. Yum. :) Nicest and sweetest customer service as well!"}
{"text":"Delicious, smooth mochas. The deluxe breakfast was huge, delicious and filling. Great service and chill vibe. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Great place to chill out n study, excellent customer service n yummy coffees, than you"}
{"text":"I saw their business card at another shop close by... so I drove around to check it out.. I would suggest some type of open sign for front window because it looked dark inside and I though they were closed.. I do agree with others that it's a bit pricey... I got a regular drip kona coffee and a apple turnover.. they were both really good."}
{"text":"Yummy treats and espresso! I love that they serve OnoSweetz pastries and goodies here. Now I can get my coffee and sugar fix all at one place. So far my faves are the Coco/Haupia and Salted Caramel Almond Butter Lattes."}
{"text":"My fiancé always picked up their scones for me. Guys!!!!!!!! Their scones are to die for--buttery, flavorful and crunchy. All their pastries are pretty good actually so as their coffee. I'd definitely recommend this cool little place."}
{"text":"Awesome place to enjoy the flavors of Hawaii...through the pastries and their coffees...good place to relax and enjoy a cup of Joe and indulge in the best Hawaiian desserts that I say is way better than back In Hawaii...come check it out"}
{"text":"Great coffee and smoothies. The kona was so good, so much better than Starbucks. The owner and staff were also extremely nice and went out of their way to talk to us and even offered to brings chairs out so we could sit in the front since we had our dogs. They knew most customers by name which I thought was really impressive. Unfortunately you just don't get that kind of service in most places but here you can tell that they truly appreciate their customers. We'll be back every Sunday!"}
{"text":"Excellent Hawaiian pastries. The breakfast sandwich this morning was delicious. This morning we had 6 pastries and they were all superb. Troy and his staff are simply wonderful. I would highly recommend this great cafe"}
{"text":"Best coffee in town! The workers here are also super friendly! It's also a really nice, chill place to study. I've been getting the Ehu Kai every time I come here and it's always made above my expectations, so good for my soul."}
{"text":"My poor wallet will not survive here. This place is so nice. Had their matcha tea latte and a peppermint tea. Everything is so good and not too sweet.   The staff is so sweet here. I am awaiting a day they have some sort of stamp card or something lol xD"}
{"text":"Came here the other morning for some early morning coffee and reading.  I ended up with a beautifully made Chai Latte. One of the best I have probably ever had. Light, and hearty at the same time. I wish I could have this every morning!  The staff was friendly and the atmosphere was very calm and simple!"}
{"text":"I just learned something today.  I must be a hipster because I love me some cold brew.  I admit it, I have cold brew on the daily.  I have no shame in admitting to it.  You just won't see me wearing skinny jeans anytime soon.  Besides, I can't fit my quads in a pair of skinny jeans.   Let me get a couple of things out of the way first.  The customer service from the staff, including the owner, is as good as it gets.  I also don't do sweets, croissants & pastries do nothing for me, and I'm not a latte type of guy.  That being said, my review is strictly for their coffee.  Prices for their coffee is competitive to the rest of the coffee cafes out here. An Americano is less than $3, cold brew is $4, and their 100% Kona Coffee is $5 for a 12 oz. or $6 for a 16 oz. Their cold brew is bold and very strong.  If you're looking for a quick \"pick me up\", then this is the coffee for you.  The caffeine hit is almost instant and the energy boost is sustainable.  Their cold brew is awesome.  But lets be honest here, it's all about the 100% Kona Coffee at Hi-Coffee Café.  I've had a Kona blend and it's not even close to Hi-Coffee's 100% Kona.  100% Kona Coffee is very hard to find because it's expensive.  A 12 oz. bag of 100% Kona beans sell for close to $40.  It's crazy!  Most places that have Kona coffee will serve a blend, which is usually less than 20%. I was at a café in Hawaii a couple of weeks ago and they even used a blend to cut cost.  Hi-Coffee's 100% Kona Coffee is legit.  It has a very smooth taste and because it's not bitter, it's sort of sweet too.  Their cold brew has enough caffeine to wake you up, while their 100% Kona has a steady flow of caffeine that keep you alert for the rest of the day. If you need that boost, then pick your poison.  For me, it's all about their 100% Kona Coffee.    TIP #1:  A 12 oz. cup of 100% Kona Coffee in Hawaii cost me $7.  $5 is a deal here.   TIP #2:  Great customer service.  The staff at Hi-Coffee is 100% Kona cool beans.  TIP #3:  If enjoying a cold brew makes me a hipster, then I'm a hipster. If being a hipster is wrong, then I don't want to be right."}
{"text":"After hearing about the various changes to the food offerings, this update was long overdue. Fortunately, my taste buds were still pleased overall.  I finally managed to find enough time to drop by Hi-Coffee Cafe before work, as I did on my first visit; it's a convenient stop on my highway route (and one that I should consider making more often). Although they're longer partnered with Ono Sweetz 702 (which was responsible for most of my rave review last time around), Hi-Coffee still offers quite a few pastries, and I eagerly dove in to sample several.  Cold Brew Coffee ($4): cold brewing takes out a lot of the bitter flavors from coffee while sacrificing little else, and this was certainly the case here. A pleasant drink overall, and kept me alert throughout the day.  Bacon, Egg, Cheddar Croissant Sandwich ($5.50): a very simple take on this breakfast classic. My friend tried a bit of this and equated it to a fast food breakfast sandwich. I couldn't really argue, given the modest amounts of every filling and the lackluster croissant. And flavor-wise, it just wasn't anything special.  Blueberry Scone ($2.75): not as rich in flavor as my favorite scones, but copious amounts of blueberries. More importantly, good texture, especially the crunch on the outside. Most importantly, it's surprisingly affordable compared to other offerings here.  Guava Haupia Dessert Bar ($3.50): can't-miss desserts are not something that I've typically associated with Henderson, but this fits the bill. It's like a light, airy, coconut-y cheesecake, especially considering the base crust of this. The guava icing wasn't that important here, and I'd probably have enjoyed the non-guava version to an equal extent. Definitely gonna come back for this.  Chocolate Coconut Muffin ($2.75): the employee recommended this when I asked, and she was so on point. It's a fluffy, rich muffin with plenty of chocolate, and it took all I had to stop eating all of it at once. I finished it later that day anyway. It's not always available, so get it when you see it!  Almond Croissant ($4.50): I'll give them a pass on the texture because I waited a day to try it, but there is a baffling lack of almond flavor and toppings aside from some burnt almonds on the top of the croissant. This is a mediocre product at best and probably should be removed from the offerings posthaste.  Pikake Green Milk Tea ($4.50, discounted to $3.60 Mon-Fri 3-6pm): went back during their kinda-sorta-happy-hour to try this drink, but it still wasn't worth the price with the massive ice bomb that took up somewhere from one-third to one-half of the cup. The boba wasn't spot-on either, with most of the spheres falling apart too easily. It's too easy to find perfectly al dente pearls these days, even in Las Vegas, but apparently Henderson is still lagging behind. The tea was pretty nice at least, with a jasmine-esque flavor that I probably would've enjoyed if it hadn't run out during the drive home.  Bacon Cheddar Scone ($2.75): now this one hit the spot. I picked this up along with the milk tea, and it had the enjoyable texture of the sweet scones with the richness of bacon and cheddar. Another big winner.  Butter Mochi ($2.50): a rectangular cut of a ubiquitous pastry. It's chewy but not overly so, but the butter and coconut flavor wasn't impressive. Best enjoyed for the texture rather than the flavor.  Hi-Coffee isn't the best cafe around by any means; its pastries are hit or miss (definitely not a good croissant bakery) but the hits are home runs or at least triples. I'll probably be back on occasion. I'll also have to try the fresh fruit smoothies, especially if I skip the boba."}
{"text":"Located across the street from EOS Gym, Hi Coffee is a family owned restaurant that specializes in quality Kona coffee. Like many of the students that frequent this establishment, I first came here looking for a quiet place to drink a good cup of coffee and get some school work done. I didn't realize that after my initial visit, I would soon become a regular!  Location: Like I stated above, it is located across the street from the EOS Gym on Stephanie and the 215. It doesn't look like much from the outside, but the inside is very spacious. Though I am not from the islands of Hawaii, there is something about the pastel blue walls and bright wooden floors that makes it feel like home.  Service: From the workers to the owners themselves, I have never had a bad experience with their service. The owners will regularly walk up to various tables and ask to see if everything was to your liking. Seeing the relationships they all have with the regulars shows how much of a genuine connection they strive to have with every person that walks through their doors. Recently, they added a rewards system for anyone who wants it. I believe it is $.10 earned for every $1.00 spent to redeem later on. With the amount of times I come here, this will surely come in handy!  Food: So many options! This establishment specializes in 100% Kona coffee. Their cold brew is one of the strongest I have ever had. It kept me awake and alert all day after a 48-hour all nighter (if that's still considered an all-nighter at that point). The taste is pleasant and not bitter/sour like some other cold brews I've tried. As with their lattes, I regularly get the Waimea (Choco/Haupia flavored). It has a lot of flavor to it, but is not too sweet. Their food options are very good, as well! Their coconut haupia bars and butter mocha offer delicious sweet options and if I want something more savory, I go for the bacon/cheese scone or masubi. I haven't tried anything here that I disliked.  From the coffee to the people, Hi Coffee truly stands out from the rest of the coffee shops in the Valley. I've never been to the Hawaiian islands, but if it is just as welcoming and delicious as Hi Coffee is, I absolutely cannot wait until I finally get to visit."}
{"text":"When I'm here I feel like I'm back on the island. The hospitality and great food/drink are a total package for an island lover like me."}
{"text":"Huli Ovah, apple turnoverish, was awesome. Best apple turnover i have had in my life. 808 creme brulee was also excellent. Guava cupcake was just as good as other two! First time i have ever yelped while eating!"}
{"text":"This has become a definite stop for us when in LV... We come here both by the coffee and the pastries. I love that they use Kona coffee and have great flavors, such as their chocolate raspberry haupia frappe.  We always walk away with pastries to take with us on the drive back to Cali as well.  Been to Vegas 2 in the last 6 months, plan to be back again this summer/fall and will define ty stop by for more coffee and pastries!  They are fairly new and located in a small shopping area.  Found them on YELP of course...  Give them a try, even if it's on your way or on your way out of Vegas.  You won't regret!"}
{"text":"The Haupia coconut cream bars are phenomenal! Delightful staff and military friendly. Had a chocolate coconut Haupia and my mom's salted caramel almond butter latte was a hit! The blueberry scone was the best we 2 Canadians have ever had!"}
{"text":"I only had coffee here, but found it a simple, straight up coffee shop with standard coffee, lattes, espressos, etc. the staff were friendly, although even though our group ordered drinks and a couple pastries, someone in our group whispered to me that the owner or manager was annoyed I'd grabbed a teriyaki bowl from next door. Id just finished doing two hours of strenuous exercise and needed something other than a macaroon or pastry.   Very clean, but simple, plain decor with a Hawaiian emphasis on coffee."}
{"text":"Friendly, inviting and delicious. The Kona coffee reminds me of Hawaii and their spam and egg croissant was amazing - a must try :)"}
{"text":"Pros:  The Chantilly Cake was great (from a non cake lover) The espresso drinks were smooth and solid. The coffee is well balanced, not bitter, and generally quite good. Staff is pleasant. Cons: if you don't like your coffee sweetened be sure to mention to the barista beforehand or a light coconut sweetener (which is nice if you like sweet coffee) is automatically added. Happy to recommend this place if you live in Henderson and want a good quality espresso drink or a sweet indulgence."}
{"text":"Vegas is truly the ninth Hawaiian island now that they have 100% Kona coffee. I haven't seen 100% since I was on vacation in Hawaii!  Kona coffee is strong with a sour aftertaste. It's a flavor that took me a little to get used to, but it's different and good. The shop is clean, simple and has wifi. It's the perfect place to study! They have a very small selection of baked goods and tons of drinks.  We tried the kona coffee and the choco-coconut macadamia nut latte (hot). The kona coffee was dripped and made to order. The latte had a hint of coconut, but a stronger macadamia nut taste. Sweet, but not too sweet.  We were told to try the Haupia Latte as it's their most ordered- I'll have to come back to try it!  With so many coffee shops opening up around Henderson and with a coffee chain in practically the same plaza, how will Hi-Coffee Cafe survive? If you're looking for something quick, they don't have a drive through and with each drink being made individually, it may take a while. Come to Hi-Coffee Cafe if you're looking for a cozy cafe to sit in to chat or study. I can promise you you'll enjoy the time you spend in the cafe better than you will sitting in the coffee chain next door."}
{"text":"Came in for a quick cup of coffee.  I got the Cappuccino, the wife got the regular drip.  The Cappuccino is Excellent.  Legitimately EXCELLENT.  The regular drip was thin and watery.  Not BAD, but after the deliciousness of the cappuccino, it was a letdown.  The upside, is the coffee is fresh.  Drip coffee is poured over the grounds, and this insures a quality product.  Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"This place is really good, the staff was so friendly and helpful I got an ice drew that was the best I have ever had and my daughter had a signature latte with coconut milk that she couldn't say enough good about  I suggest you check it our"}
{"text":"I really like the ambience of this place. Their coffee is expensive, I just ordered a Kona blend with cream & vanilla and it was over $6. The coffee itself was good, but I did not even drink it because they did not make it to my liking. I guess I was not specific enough. I will probably be back to try it again. Will update after the next time I visit."}
{"text":"I've been here twice and overall I'm happy with this cute little coffee shop. My coffee has always been great and the employees were friendly and welcoming.  The shop is conveniently located on Stephanie Street near the 215. Parking near the shop is a breeze. Inside the shop is simply decorated and clean with enough seating for those that want to relax for a bit. The employees were very friendly and worked quickly to prepare my coffee each time.  On both visits I've had delicious lattes. There are a nice number of latte options and choosing just one will be hard. There are cool flavors like Pumpkin Spice Cookie Butter, Irish Cream Eggnog, and Almond Joy. I like that they came up with some creative flavors in addition to the typical coffee options. My favorite was the White Chocolate Lavender Latte. Yum! It had a nice sweetness without overwhelming the delicious coffee.   Each time I have visited I arrived excited for the delicious pastries that I see on Instagram, but haven't found much selection when I arrive. The first time I thought it might be because it was a weekday so I returned on a weekend. The Saturday offering was a little better, but not a huge selection. My mom and I split a Haupia bar. It had a fine flavor, but wasn't anything exciting. Hopefully there will be more exciting pastries to try on my next visit.  Overall, I really like this shop and I will definitely return. Those exciting latte flavors will lure me in every time!"}
{"text":"As I pulled up and parked they welcomed me like they knew me! The entire feel felt like I was back in Hawaii (my home town).   The pastry selection and desserts were Hawaiian and some traditional American stuff! Not too overwhelming with dishes but just enough!! I ordered my grandma some things I knew she would love. I ordered the Haupia Ube cake, chichi mochi because it was pink and that's her favorite color! And for myself to stay I ordered the apple cinnamon cake which was shaped like a beautiful flower topped with sugar powder. This tasted so delicious with the perfect balance of cinnamon and apple. Not too sweet actually! It was perfect.. as I bit into it there was both crisp with an overlapping softness to it. It was an incredible texture!   Last but not least, the kona coffee. I ordered it in a 12oz in a Pour Over (coffee geek alert) lol!! I had it black so that I can taste he flavors. There are plenty of fruitful notes in it. You can definitely taste the brightness of it. If someone wanted to drink black coffee for the first time, kona would be the best introduction. Ordering it as a pour over also helped enhance the flavor profile journey because it brings out the fruitiness of the coffee. As it started to cool the nutty notes started to come out. I loved it!  I stayed for their ambience and wifi! Great Hawaiian music and you can see they have a lot of people who come in and out for coffee. Popular spot!  I'll definitely be back multiple times!!"}
{"text":"Huapia latte, mochi butter cake and med student fixtures adorn this quaint local hangout spot with an island flair.  Butter Mochi - what part of this doesn't sound good? Soft chewy sweet treat with a slight coconut flavor. The perfect dessert to enjoy with a warm huapia latte. I can almost smell the pikake jasmine.   My wife is a huge fan of the apple turnovers. Not too sweet, but right amount of filling to pastry ratio. Do yourself a favor & pre-order them as they will sell out.  They have a rotating assortment of freshly made desserts and extensive menu of drinks from lattes, to smoothies, bubble teas, and the best cold brew coffee.  They also serve breakfast which of course includes your choice of spam :)  Don't let the owner, Troy, bust your chops too much...he is a teddy bear. Just don't ask for the Kama'aina discount lol!"}
{"text":"Such an amazing atmosphere and great coffee. If you're looking for something different with beautiful music, fantastic customer service and a really nice selection, make HI-Coffee your next stop!"}
{"text":"I really like to support local small businesses.  As a business owner myself I understand what effort goes into starting one up and all the trials and tribulations that the business owners and the employees have to put in to try and make it successful.  Kona coffee is also special to me because of my attachment to Hawaii.  As far as I know, this is the only place in Vegas that specializes in 100% Kona coffee.  Please don't mistake a Kona blend for the real deal.  As Hawaii is the only state in the US that can grow coffee commercially, I always bring back coffee to the mainland whenever I go to the islands.  I tried HI-Coffee's kona coffee and their blueberry muffin (I think it was a blueberry banana muffin)  this morning.  The coffee was a nice legit kona pour over and I really enjoyed my muffin with plenty of real blueberries in it.  Tasted and looked home-made so that's always a plus in my book.  To the owners and workers of this establishment, I wish you guys the best and I really hope you guys are successful.  Mahalo for the hospitality."}
{"text":"I have been to numerous coffee shops looking for the coffee that Wows me. By far, this place is the best! Hands down! They have a great variety of flavors, but my favorite is the Coconut Latte; which is always consistent no matter who makes it. The Haupia Cream Cheese Bar is freakin' AMAZING & the customer service is always friendly, warm & welcoming. If you're looking for great coffee this place will surely satisfy your coffee palette."}
{"text":"Finally got around to trying this place. I work not too far from here, and am looking for a place other than Starbucks to get coffee. I came in around 6:30pm and it was completely empty. The girl at the counter was really nice and very helpful. She made a suggestion and I ended up getting a cold brew with a shot of lavender syrup and cream. The coffee was good but I paid over $7 for what was an equivalent to a venti. It's a bit steep for me to pay that much on a regular basis. She did suggest I come in between 3-6 for some sort of special offer, but I was in sticker shock, so I'm not too sure what the offer is, a certain percent off. I'm all about trying to help small local businesses, hence why I'm looking for a non-Starbucks place to get coffee; but, although the coffee was good, it wasn't $7 good. I most likely won't be coming back."}
{"text":"The owner (Troy) and all the baristas who work here are all very kind, accommodating, and full of great suggestions.  I personally love their kona cold brew (when I act like an adult- it's strong and is a bit of an acquired taste) and their coconut haupia lattes when I want to feel like a kid (sweet and delish).  Their croissants are always fresh and butterly flakey (I get a bacon, egg, and cheese on a croissant when I'm hungry, or on an onion bagel- both are delicious), peanut butter chocolate chip muffins, butter mochi, and coconut haupia bars (kind of like a frozen coconut cheesecake!)."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I love this place!! You definitely get good vibes when you walk in. The owner is extremely nice and welcoming. He makes the pastries and cakes from scratch. Everything is fresh. You won't regret it!"}
{"text":"Friendly service. The barista recommended their Iced Coconut Banana Latte. How could I resist? Now, I recommend it to you! The place is nicely decorated and I loved the music they were playing. If I lived nearby, I'd hang out here often."}
{"text":"I came here on an early morning to hang out with my friend and have some iced coffee. But when I noticed all the dessert and food options they had, I was too tempted and did not regret it one bit.  Environment: in the early morning, this spot was pretty empty. The cafe is located on Stephanie in a pretty random small plaza. It looks pretty plain on the outside, but the inside was nice and clean. It was a Hawaiian themed shop but it actually kind of had a salon type of feeling with its layout, but I can imagine it being pretty good to study since there was a lot of seating.   Service: the baristas were all really sweet and tried to make conversations. They were very open to answering any questions I had.  Food and drinks: the price was pretty cheap, but the food and drinks we orders were really good. I had a cheese cake and spam masubi. Both were super devious, and spam masubi in the morning sounds strange but it was soo good, very warm sweet and savory. The cheese cake was also delicious, not too cheesy and not too sweet, easy to eat.  I also enjoyed my coffee and my friend really liked his flavored latte.  Overall, great spot for some food and drinks. I would also say it is a great study spot."}
{"text":"Although 2016 was personally a fantastic year, it was a rough year for celebrity deaths. I'm not just talking about famous rock stars and Hollywood stars. I am also talking about the local celebrities that are the businesses that serve the community. One of them was Gimme Some Sugar, a beloved sweet spot where local Yelper's including the Sugar Mafia met up.for good times and desserts. Just as it seemed that one chapter concluded at Stephanie Street and Paseo Verde Parkway, another opened. Just when the Las Vegas Valley was about to celebrate Christmas, it was celebrating the grand opening of Hi Coffee.      It should not come as a surprise  that the same Yelper that told me about Gimme Some Sugar was the individual that introduced me to HI Coffee. It was Shirley B's pictures and review that brought me to the crossroads of the vacated Gimme Some Sugar. It was a crossroads that I have returned to.     Hi Coffee specializes in quality coffee including Hawaiian grinded Kona coffee. I have been so satisfied with their drip coffee, that the satisfaction keeps me returning for it. I can tell that coffee is good that by the time it turns to cooler temperature I am still savoring it. I also know that the coffee is impeccably good when the coffee shop does not have to resort to higher priced selections such as pour overs.     Everytime that I entered the spacious cafe, a friendly woman has welcomed me to the shop. I exchange $2 and change for a cup of coffee in a mug. The friendly woman transitions from the friendly cashier to a coffee artist that painstakingly creates a high quality cup of coffee. In a few minutes she delivers the cup to my table by the wall opposite the pastry case and near the cat statue. There were a couple of times that the owner walked to my table to make sure that the drink was to my liking.     As 2016 comes to a close in a few hours, Hi Coffee will come to open quality coffee experiences in 2017. Hi Coffee is the perfect business to make up for the loss of Gimme Some Sugar at Stephanie Street and Paseo Verde Parkway."}
{"text":"Staff you can fall in love with!!! They are terrific!  I haven't had a cup of Kona Coffee in a long time and stopped in to taste test theirs.  Wow, it is simply the best coffee anywhere around here!!!  You have got to go in there and get a cup or two. You will agree with me, I know!"}
{"text":"The Hi in the name refers to Hawaii and we saw a sign indicating 100% Kona coffee is available. The cafe was not busy on the Sunday morning of our visit so we were quickly waited on by a smiling cashier. My and I decided to share orders of blueberry and white chocolate scones. Each was moist though there was not a lot difference in the taste between the two scones. My wife had a regular small coffee that turned out to be fairly large."}
{"text":"Mellow and hello from Hawaii is the vibe I got when I first walked into this coffee shop. I have been meaning to try this place out, but took forever to get around to it. I initially was enticed to come here because of the beautiful pictures of an ube birthday cake, but when I called in about it They informed me the company that supplies some of their pastry, Ono Bakery, is not there anymore. However, it still not deter me from giving this place a try. Lots of Hawaaiin coffee variety. Hot or cold. Girl that helped me was helpful and sweet. Even suggested the ube huapaia bar. Gave me a big piece too. Nice! It was soft, coconutty, and some flavors of ube. The crust was some sort of graham cracker cookie crust which held together ok. Pretty tasty though. Got the Kona iced coffee to go. Really strong and refreshing. The store is clean with big picnic like tables to hang out in. Also had some 2 seater tables if you needed to pop open your laptop and study or work. What is also cool about the place, besides the good service, is that they had some traditional Hawaiian music playing in the background, which I found very relaxing.  I would come back again."}
{"text":"If I could give more stars I would!!! Although I'm not a coffee fanatic, the staff here has such superb customer service. They're the most friendliest and welcoming people ever!! They practically know everyone that walks in on a first name basis. Troy is incredibly generous and takes care of you unlike most coffee/cafe places. Definitely gonna be a regular here, such good vibes and good music, love coming here to study."}
{"text":"The drinks AND desserts are so tasty here. Service is very  friendly. If you crave kona coffee or island desserts, this is definitely the place to go. Since there aren't always more than 2 employees you might wait a little for your beverage."}
{"text":"I stopped in here yesterday with high hopes I could get great 100% Kona coffee and hopefully find some yummy Hawaiian treats to go with it. Unfortunately, this was a major disappointment. I wanted to taste some strong Kona coffee and ordered the Americano which is espresso mixed with water (thanks fellow Yelpers). The barista told me it was 100 percent Kona coffee. I took one sip and knew the advertisement was too good to be true. It was so watered down it tasted like gas station coffee. I normally dont go back to the \"barista\" but asked her if she could put more espresso in there cause it tasted awful. I opened the lid and could see the coffee was a light brown color instead of a rich black color. She looked at me and said she already put in 2 shots but she would put in another. It took her 2 seconds to put another shot of espresso. Even I know it takes longer than 2 seconds to get another shot of espresso through the coffee machine. Maybe she put too much water in it...but Im not going to ask her to keep adding more coffee if it still tastes like water and not coffee after she added another shot. I decided to let it be and toss it in the trash on the way out. I have tried many local coffee shops around town and this left me very disappointed as I've been searching for Kona coffee for awhile. They also did not have any Hawaiian treats I read about. They had blueberry muffins and 2 kinds of scones. Neither was Hawaiian influenced. I guess the only place I can get Kona coffee is Bahama Bucks which is a snow ice place. Their Kona coffee is pretty good."}
{"text":"Great place! Was visiting Henderson on vacation and found this place based on Yelp Reviews. The service is friendly and the coffee is delicious. I also tried one of there crossiants and it was yummy. Will return here again in the future. A+"}
{"text":"Came in with the lady being spontaneous and such, and we were NOT disappointed.. We're frequent Grouchy John's (Shout out to Grouchy's!) goers and lovve mocha frappes (basic I know) with that legit strong coffee note, and this place really hit the spot when we tried their signature drink that's mixed with hazelnut and mocha *forgot the name of it because I was too amazed by the drink* lol.  We came on a Saturday late morning and it was slightly busy. Yet the two girls working still had really nice and welcoming service.  Their pastries looked really good. We definitely will be back to try some more menu items out! 5 stars, aloha"}
{"text":"I recently discovered the deliciousness that is Kona coffee in the past year or so from a friend who had visited Hawaii and now Starbucks just won't cut it for me anymore. So I stumbled upon this place while perusing the new eats on Yelp and I was so excited to try it, since this was one of the only spots in Vegas offering 100% Kona coffee. I came to study for a few hours, and when I entered, I was immediately greeted by the barista and that's when I noticed the large amount of items on the menu. Service was really the star of this experience; the barista was so nice and accommodating and gave me so many options for special coffee creations and yet, it didn't feel overwhelming or intimidating, as some overly enthusiatic servers can come across as. The pure Kona coffee items are pretty pricey, ranging from $2-6, which is pretty standard for this kind of imported coffee. The rest of the items were flavored lattes ranging from holiday themes (gingerbread, peppermint mocha) to island themes (haupia, macadamia nut), and everything in between; these range from $3-5. I got the cold brew Kona, and when I mentioned that I usually add a bit of creamer with my coffee, she suggested that I try it first black and that if I wanted to still add creamer, she would gladly do it (because she informed me that milk/cream can ruin the flavor of the coffee). Before I even paid, the drink was brought out to me so that I could make sure I liked what I ordered, which was really nice, and I ended up loving it black as suggested. Overall, this was one of the most pleasant coffee shops I've been to and it wasn't hipster, or gimmicky, the coffee wasn't given to me in a smoking beaker, it was just great coffee, great service, and a comfortable environment."}
{"text":"Hawaiian themed coffee shop and cafe. Me and my daughter just stopped by to check it out. I ended up having a egg, bacon and cheese WAFFLE sandwhich which was fantastic. My daughter had a regular waffle. I also ordered a regular coffee which was great too. Afterwards we shared a shave ice; snow capped of course!  We'll be back for sure. Aloha!"}
{"text":"Loved the ambience, music and aroma here(feels like being on vacation),  I was promptly greeted by Troy (owner) and his super friendly staff.  Was a little intimidated with the options on menu and different flavors but after speaking with Troy I decided on trying the Kona coffee.    All their beans are a maximum of 3 days old so you definitely can taste the freshness and quality in their brew.  The Kona coffee doesn't need any cream or sugar, naturally delicious.  Pastry selection is small (banana nut bread was given as a sample)  Blueberry sconces, muffins and the  Egg and Bacon croissant.     I highly recommend supporting local and giving this place a visit.  Enjoy your drink and relax with the taste and spirit of Hawaii!  Aloha"}
{"text":"Mellow atmosphere and amazing coffee. Makes you feel the Aloha spirit like you're at a small island cafe in Hawaii. The staff is friendly and you'll feel right at home. They have some Hawaiian juices and deserts too! Yummy!"}
{"text":"Wonderful local coffee shop with Kona coffee!  I love the lavender vanilla iced coffee. The bacon cheddar scone is a yummy savory treat. And they have French Macaroons, my fav cookie. Go and enjoy some fabulous coffee and a cookie."}
{"text":"Come for the coffee, stay for the desserts. The only coffee I brew at home is Kona coffee, so I absolutely love this Hawaiian coffee shop that serves 100% Kona coffee. The desserts here are equally awesome with creative concoctions unique to this coffee shop.   The cold brew is no joke. This one will get your caffeine buzz going right away. The iced Kona coffee was good too, but not as strong.   They also have specialty drinks and seasonal drinks. I really liked the cookie butter pumpkin spice latte. I love coconut! Between the almond joy and the coconut haupia latte, the latter was da bomb!  Coco puffs OMG. Better than Liliha. It's true! Liliha's coco puffs are just too soggy for me. Ono sweetz is perfection.   My favorite dessert is Troy's creation the haupia bar, which is a coconut dessert that is really not too coconutty. The distinct three layers of crust, cream cheese, and haupia go together so well!   My favorite tart flavors are: ube (the purple one!) and chantilly.   The baristas are super sweet. Troy and Annette have made their rounds and greet and meet their customers. I love that!  Overall good vibes all around!  *****Yelp 2016 100 Challenge***** 64/100"}
{"text":"I was on this side of town running errands and really needing some coffee but did not want Starbucks. This coffee place has fab reviews and decided to give it a try. I ordered the Americano and a blueberry scone. Hot, fresh, and delicious!!!! Clean, simple place. I will be back."}
{"text":"Say Aloha to one of Hendersons rising stars Hi-Coffee Cafe.  Hi-Coffee Cafe is known for serving up 100% Kona Coffee,  Like mature wines, Kona coffee is notable from commercial blends by the extra attention taken throughout every step of the process.  The coffee is subtle yet flavorful and with a rich aromatics. In my opinion, to fully appreciate the coffee it does not need a lot of sweetener nor creamer. Among that the cafe has your usual thirst quenchers of coffees, espressos, and specialty lattes. My sweet tooth beverage as of late has been the Almond Joy, very delicious.  They also have an assortment of desserts made by Ono Sweets, if you've never had Ono Sweets you are missing out big time. The UBE tarts, apple turn overs and cupcakes just to name a few are to die for all made from scratch and made in the shop. If you are new to Hawaiian desserts, this is the best place to start.  Can't say enough good things about the staff who work there, especially Troy (owner) & Annette (baker), one of the nicest & dedicated people I've ever met. I love chatting with them it brightens up my day.  I highly recommend any coffee connoisseur out there to give this place a chance."}
{"text":"2016 Yelp 100 Review Challenge 64/100  Came here for 100% Kona Coffee! It's the only place in Vegas that serves it. 100% Kona Coffee is different from \"Kona Coffee\" -- if it doesn't say 100% then it's mixed with other coffee beans. It's also pricier than other types of coffee, and well worth the $5-6 a cup.   As I walked in, the owner saw my Hawai'i hat and joked they don't serve Hawai'i people. They from Ohio. Haha joking of course. You know they really from Hawai'i when they joke around and tease. I miss that. (Don't take it personal, it's Hawai'ian humor)   My first visit, I got the 100% Kona Coffee and a coconut macaroon. By 4pm on a Saturday they were out of the desserts I wanted to try. So freakin' bummed.   Coconut Macaroon:   I'm usually not a fan of this dessert, but I tried this one and it's delish. Baked well, not too sweet. Soft & chewy coconut center & toasted just right. Try it!   100% Kona Coffee:  I got mines black. Just how I like my coffee. It's strong, bold, not bitter. I have been off caffeine the past few weeks and this was well worth that caffeine kick! After a few minutes I began to sound like a Gilmore ;-). (Gilmore Girls reference)   Loved this and will be back for it. It's the real deal 100% Kona Coffee.   Their 100% Kona Coffee is great, but the best 100% Kona Coffee I've had is from Sugai Kona Coffee on The Big Island. I'll have to ask where they get their Kona beans from next time I stop in.    I also tried their Cold Brew which was great as well, bold and strong.   Ube/Taro Flan Cake: This past week, I tried a slice (custom order from OnoSweetz702) -- this was onolicious! The cake layers were soft, moist & flavorful. You can taste the taro and flan. Not too sweet.   Service was great. I didn't get to stay long. After I got my coffee I left. I took a sip when I got to my car and noticed it was lukewarm. I wondered, why isn't it hot? Walked back in and he heated it up for me and was super nice about it. Not sure what happened during the coffee making process.   Will update when I try the other desserts! Aloha!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this coffee shop not only for its bold island flavors but their delicious pastries as well. Absolute love the guava desserts and their tarts are too die for! The atmosphere is calming and it's a great place to study or meet up with friends."}
{"text":"Great place to study. Clean and simple decor. And probably one of the most sweetest coffee owners I've met!"}
{"text":"So after a long St. Patty's weekend, full of stress, I decided to stop by this Hawaiian coffee shop to start my morning. Upon walking in I was hit with a laid back ambiance and relaxing island reggae playing in the background. I was promptly greeted and helped out by Youjia; she had a great bubbly personality and quickly educated me on the daily specials and favorites. She recommended the Coconut Haupia latte which was delicious and as far as I know, only available here. This is definitely going to be my go to coffee shop moving forward."}
{"text":"I went in for the Kona coffee and I wasn't disappointed. Pure 100% Kona isn't cheap but if it was too low, then I'd have my doubts. But one sip and this is the real deal.   They carry a standard coffee too and a few other items so they should have something for everyone.   I'm hoping they make it ad grow since the coffee is great and I like supporting local coffee shops. And this location is convenient enough to the freeway I can stop in for a Kona fix.   Good job."}
{"text":"The ambiance of this place is laid back. Reminds me when I visit hawaii. Amazing dishes and desserts. I strongly recommend trying all their lattes."}
{"text":"Awesome service Delicious pastures Unique Hawaii inspired Coffees and Drinks They even have Shave Ice!"}

{"text":"Serving boba drinks....had creamy honey dew boba drink with just a little tapioca. Yummy!! Hubby had the Hi Coffee drink (their best seller) and he enjoyed it. He wanted something to cool him off it did the trick!! Thanks Troy! Tell your dad thanks for the recommendation!!"}
{"text":"Located in the shopping center on Stephanie near the 215.   I've always wanted to try this Hawaiian coffee place I love supporting small local businesses, hi coffee did not disappoint. I ordered a iced macadamia nut latte and it was delicious super creamy and the coffee was so flavorful it could stand alone by itself no cream or sugar needed.   Disappointed that they did not have a wide array of pastries but I did try the ube cheesecake it was creamy not too sweet and delicious I like that both the coffee and the dessert were not too sweet.     Definitely be back to support the 808"}
{"text":"Aloha! The 9th island finally have a delicious coffee shop that pays homage to the flavors of Hawaii, the best State in the US. Lol  Talk about the drive getting here from the West/Northwest side of town. It was like driving around Oahu, the island where Honolulu is located on. I was determined to stop by since we were halfway there because we were in the Downtown area. The moment we walked in felt like we were going back home to Hawaii and being greeted by our family. The staff was very welcoming and knew that it was our first time because we started to taking pictures and I was on my snapchat.  Troy, the owner approach us with a warm embrace found among Kama'aina. He was very friendly and knowledgeable about coffee especially the use of 100% Kona Coffee, which is rare among your standard coffee shops. Most places will sale and offer Kona Coffee but it's usually 10% Kona blend with other beans to compensate cost.   Honestly, we did not try their Kona Coffee but we went with their Specialty drinks. I got my self the Coconut Macademia Nut Latte and my Sister got the Almond Joy Latte both over iced. Both drinks were delicious. The coffee, actually the espresso paired well with the sweet flavor of coconut and chocolate. I Highly recommend to try either drinks but what stood out for us on this particular visit were the Butter Mochi and Haupia Cream Cheese Bar. Its been awhile we had Butter Mochi, a stapple among desserts in Hawaii. This may be a bit different for others mainly because of the texture being more sticky and chewy. At first glance, it looks like a standard square shaped cake slice with a tan/brown like color. But you will not regret trying this pastry out!   The Haupia Cream Cheese Bar was mind blowing! Its was like having a homemade cheesecake with coconut flavoring that balanced the creamy taste of cream cheese. Every bite was heavenly with the slight crunch of the cookie bar.  **Mahalo Troy and the amazing staff! We had an awesome time and enjoyed everything we got! We will back for more or whenever we are in the area, brother!  **Mahalo Shirley B. for the cool and useful review. Another reason why I had to try this place out. Along with Trixie N., Daniel Dong-Kyu K. & Sharlene B."}
{"text":"I was so happy to have a new coffee shop within walking distance. So far, in my 2 visits, this has been just OK though, so I won't be a regular just yet. My father in law got iced coffee but was upset because the largest they had was I think 16 ounce... by the time they add the ice in you can barely get a decent amount of coffee. I think they should have more size options for iced beverages. They didn't have decaf, which I want sometimes because I'm breastfeeding and want coffee but not too much caffeine. It took a while for a regular coffee to be made. My friend ordered a glass of regular milk for her toddler and it took a long time to get and was frozen. The shop itself is very nice inside and my friend said the apple turnover was to die for. I'm sure those who love Kona will become regulars here, but for me I'll need to stick to Starbucks and Coffee Bean for now."}
{"text":"It took me forever to finally check out Hi-Coffee Café but it happened. I definitely do not regret it. It is a bit farther out because my friends and I are usually in the Southwest area but we made it happen. I can't say that there was a single thing I disliked about Hi-Coffee at all, thus the five star review.   I've made two visits now and have been able to try two different lattes and three different types of sweets that they offered. I have tried their macadamia nut latte and their salted caramel almond butter latte.   Both lattes are very smooth and when you're drinking it, you're not drinking diabetes in a cup -- major plus! The aroma of their coffee is simply delicious. The taste, flavor, and overall blend is simply fantastic. I can't say enough good things about it. I love well made lattes. Their salted caramel almond butter latte sounds like it would be awfully sweet but it isn't. I didn't even have them adjust the sweetness levels. They also use real almond butter with it so the latte may have a few grainy bits but still delicious never the less. My boyfriend isn't a coffee drinker but I find him sipping on my lattes more often when they're from Hi-Coffee.   As for their sweets section, I have tried their guava cake, ube huapia bar, and their butter mochi. Their guava cake has really good guava flavor -- it was very aromatic. I think my grandmother would love this cake! The ube huapia bar is also very delicious -- not too sweet and full of coconut flavor. The butter mochi was a block of mochi. It didn't really stand out too much to me so it was just so-so.   Overall, definitely worth a visit, especially if you are a coffee drinker or if you want to try some Hawaiian sweets. I'll definitely be back for their lattes !! Now if only it would be closer to my house......"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this coffee shop. I live on the south west side near the 215, and I would still drive out here just to relax, have a drink and do homework. This is the second time I've been here.   The first time I came here was with my fiancé, we were in the area at the time. I forgot what drink he got, but for me I got the Haupia latte at the time and their butter mochi, it was so ONO! Today I just had a tea, and a spam musubi. I can't wait to try their other items.   For me I love searching for new coffee shops to spend my time at, and this is by far one of my top faves. I love the atmosphere, it's clean, good amount of seating and great customer service. The owners, or who I believe are the owners are so friendly and welcoming which I love! Feels just like home (Hawaii)! You bet I'll be back more often then not, even if it's a drive for me."}
{"text":"I love this coffee shop! Great coffee and bake goods! The coffee shop offers great quality coffee and expresso. My favorite is Coconut Haupia. Staff is very friendly. Five star all the way!:)"}
{"text":"HI Coffee is a Hawaiian coffee shop.  After I read most good and bad reviews,  I've decided to write one as well. I have to say I am a regular here.  I have been here at least twice per week since they opened.   I have tried their Kona coffee, regular coffee, lattes options, Chai tea latte, and iced beverages.  I love coffee, therefore I enjoy them all.  I can tell the different of coffee though.  You pay for what you get.  They added the pastries which add more flavors to the Hawaiian coffee shop.  It is now complete as a coffee shop.  I love all the pastries.  There are so many kinds to offer. Many fruits pastries to choose from. Green tea puff, Guava Strudel, coconut huapia, long john, cakes and all other pastries for anyone to choose from.  I am positive that one can find a piece of delicious fresh baked pastry here. The service is generally friendly.  There are times some girl is less friendly than others which you find that in most restaurants or anywhere that provide any type of customer service.  I don't allow that lack of customer service skill to ruin the flavor of a cup of coffee or a piece of pastry I pay for.   The decor is simple.  Yes more lounge couch would be nice.  More inviting warming living room to sit down with good friend with a cup of coffee and a pastry will be perfect.  I want this place to be my second living room."}
{"text":"Very nice and quaint cafe. Lots of seating and very neat and clean. The staff were really nice and answered all the questions I had about menu items. I decided to just go with the most popular drink which was the Kona coffee. I didn't add any cream or sugar because it didn't need any. It was smooth and not bitter just like how I like. They had a bunch of specialty lattes like chocolate haupia and almond joy along with the basic cafe menu items. Just wish they had wider selection of pastries they only had about two choices when I came in. But I will be back for the kona coffee."}
{"text":"I saw this place on yelp and I just had to try it out. I was so excited to try the different things they have but when I got there I was a little disappointed. Where was all the pastries? Where's the guava cream cheese croissants, long johns, Kona coffee & cookie butter tarts and coco puffs? So we ended up ordering strawberry lychee, affogato and the Waimea.   The affogato was great. I never had anything like that before. It was vanilla ice cream ( good start) with espresso ( good finish). They come separate and when you are ready you pour the espresso over the ice cream and enjoy. At least that's the way I did it.   The strawberry lychee was also very good. We ordered one and they were nice enough to split it into 2 cups for the kids.   My wife ordered the Waimea which is a chocolate Haupia latte. My wife said she didn't care for it. I tried it and I could only taste coffee though my taste buds were probably killed by the espresso and strawberry lychee bubble drink.   I really, really, really wanted to love this place but sadly I don't. I wonder if they could ask yelp to have the pictures of the things they don't have removed so people aren't expecting to see those things there."}
{"text":"I'm writing this review while I'm sitting inside Hi Coffee Cafe. I couldn't wait because I'm so impressed with this adorable little coffee place!!! I ordered bagel egg bacon cheese sandwich and banana coffee and holy cow is it delicious!!!!!! I'm not sure why I hadn't stopped by before. So thankful I found this place!"}
{"text":"Super sweet girls behind the counter! Loved my iced organic pumpkin laté! Very cute and modern inside. Clean! Definitely 5 stars."}
{"text":"Get the huapia cream cheese cake, it's sooo yummy and light! Also, we had the huapia latte and lavender latte and both were excellent!"}
{"text":"I love this coffee shop! Immediately walking in, I am so pleased by the calming vibes and welcoming from the staff. I love the setup of the place; I can imagine myself staying here for hours! Aside from the latte--which was amazing by the way--I also had their banana bread. Even that was amazing. This place just opened, but I see a lot of potential in this cafe--can't wait to see how successful it becomes!"}
{"text":"It was great! The pastries were great... had chocolate coconut scones, the puff and breakfast sandwich"}
{"text":"100% Kona Coffee. Go with that. It's the best Coffee in the world. Does not need sugar or any milk. Get it. It's like fine wine."}
{"text":"Had a honey nut latte and a egg/cheese croissant. The latte was tasty, and though the croissant was basic they used an actual egg! This isn't the case in most places. The only thing I wish they had was milk alternatives but other than that this place was great place."}
{"text":"Finally stopped in to check it out. Ordered the Kona coffee which was good. Although, 15 minutes to do a pour over coffee and $5.00 is a bit steep as it was luke warm by the time it was served. Banana bread was tasty. Young blond woman working the counter was fabulous but seemed to get no help from the owners who were walking in and out of the store. There was a definite sign of stress among the male and female owners. Not one acknowledged the 3 customers in the store. Not living the \"Aloha Spirit\" that is the island style. I was saddened by this. This is something they need to pride themselves of if they plan to stay in business as a Hawaiian themed coffee house with 3 Starbucks that are walking distance from them.  .Will try one more time next week."}
{"text":"Great coffee. I love the kona coffee pour over. The issue I had was there are no sweets. They had one plate of baked goods but that's it."}
{"text":"I'm going to probably have to give this place another try. I wasn't too impressed with my first visit. Came here with a few friends and ordered 2 lattes and 2 bars - totaling out to $19. Maybe if the drinks and bars were fantastic, then just maybe it was worth it. But the drinks were mediocre, and the OnoSweetz702 ube bars were just okay as well. I didn't dislike anything in particular - just didn't feel worth the calories. If I wanted to spend the money and gain the calories on excess, it'd have to be something really good (hey there's a reason I'm kissing haagen dazs in my profile pic). And if people are looking for a place to study, the seats aren't comfortable, and the lighting is very dim. The girls working the cashier were really nice though; when we asked for water, they opened up a fresh bottle for us and gave us 3 cups. I'll update my review when I decide to come back and try an ube cupcake or tart something. But I gotta say, I miss the ice cream place that used to be here before this cafe. Would trade it in a heartbeat."}
{"text":"Stopped by Hi - Coffee because I heard that this new coffee shop in Henderson was the only place in the valley that serves true 100% Kona coffee.  I was pleased to find out that it truly is great Kona coffee.  The owner is from Hawaii and imports the coffee from there. Staff is super friendly and the pastries are made from scratch on the premises.  Very clean and fresh place."}
{"text":"I'm not a big coffee drinker, but I am a fan of Hawaiian coffees. I often buy a Kona brand when at the supermarket.   I've stopped in here twice, and I must say the coffee is incredible. Full flavor. The people working here are very nice and friendly.  I tried a macadamia nut turnover from their bakery and it was really good. Flaky light crust and plenty of filling. Loved it!!  The shop itself is pretty minimal. MIght not be the type of coffee shop where you plug in your computer and hang out for a few hours, which is ok by me. I mean, really....who hangs out at a coffee shop except hipsters lol.  I'll be back many times."}
{"text":"Anything Annette bakes is gold. My mom is the pickiest. But this place is a winner for her. Kona coffee, chantilly cupcake, long john, crossiant and a guave pastry."}
{"text":"Great Coffee and even better pastries!! Hi-Coffee Cafe is a nice local place to have a nice custom cup of coffee and bite to eat. Nice calm atmosphere with good music playing I had the macadamia nut coffee, avocado toast and a homemade scone all very good I am a regular now for sure!! Go give it a try!!"}
{"text":"This Place is Meeeeeaaan! AWESOME  place to hang and grab so choice grinds.  Try the Ube Haulpia squares the buggah going broke da mouth!.  Grab yo slippahs and go to dis place."}
{"text":"First time drinking 100% kona coffee. It was delicious. Blueberry scone was wonderful too. Love this place!"}
{"text":"Coffee is one of those sacred things. You want it good, you want it now. This place is one of the best places in all of Las Vegas to get coffee. I've come back again and again. Worth it every time. --Good luck passing on the pastries though."}
{"text":"I have been here twice now and am just not impressed. On the first visit I walked in and the display case was empty. They had almost no pastries at 8 in the morning. I just grabbed a cup of the Kona coffee which was okay. I am not a fan of pour over, I much prefer brewed.   On my second visit a few days ago they did have some pastries but nothing like I have seen in previous reviews. Where are the long johns? Coconut scones? Guava croissants? Ube tarts? All gone. I was told that they are no longer working with the person that made those, very disappointing. The pastry selection is now very limited.   I ordered the haupia latte and haupia cream cheese bar. The bar was good but nothing I couldn't have made myself. The latte was also good with little pieces of coconut. I enjoyed it but it wasn't something that I have to go back for. I left over a 20% tip which the girl saw me put in the jar and not even a \"thank you\"."}
{"text":"Love it!! I ordered white chocolate late and croissant. These were so good. This cafe has kona coffee from Hawaii. I'll try kona's some drinks. Probably I will be repeater."}
{"text":"We were greeted the minute we walked in the door by a very nice barista. She was very friendly. We felt very welcomed  The restaurant is meticulous.  The chocolate chip scone and coffee were delicious. Overall, a great experience.  Not in this area often, but will definitely return when we are."}
{"text":"Solid 4 stars. I'm conservative so I always reserve the 5th star for perfection. This place is brand new. Good pour over Kona. There were 3 pastries. We had the blueberry scone and chocolate cookie with white chocolate and walnuts. Then we went back and tried the peanut butter cookie.   At the time there was no way to reheat the scone but was told that's coming. It's Hawaiian run and with the music I felt like I was in San Diego. All you need is the ocean view across the street.  As a plus, across the street is the new location of Poke Express.   Good vibe with a lot of potential.  5 stars for me would require more options for food. I like savory breakfast options as well as sweet stuff as I'm diabetic. Also normally drink decaf. No decaf available at the moment. Graveyard schedule prevents reg coffee in the mornings.   Solid little local place in a part of Henderson that needs more personality and they bring it."}
{"text":"This is my favorite coffee stop! They have an excellent island vibe that takes me back to paradise. The staff is incredibly friendly, the music is island style, the coffee creations are creative, and the baked goods and boba are made right there! My family LOVES the butter Mochi! If you want to feel like you are back home on the island or want to take a vacation during the middle of the day, HI Coffee Cafe should be your destination!"}
