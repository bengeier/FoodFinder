{"text":"We planned on going to \"Little Italy\" this evening but happened upon MKT Restaurant and were very pleased.  The food was great, the wait staff attentive, and the place itself was very comfortable.   We had oysters for a starter, Kathleen had the Haddock Special and I had rabbit special which was quite good.  Given the different things to eat, and the fact we were running in the Half-marathon in two days, this wasn't the evening for splitting a bottle of wine.  So we went to the wines by the glass which, while only limited to a handful of choices, were all fine for the meal. We occasionally get to Montreal and this place is on our keeper list."}
{"text":"We had a wonderful meal there last night.  The food was generally excellent.  We started off with the grilled octopus over chickpea (basically hummus) purée and an endive spinach salad with pears, pecans and blue cheese.  The octopus was very good and the salad was exquisite, an excellent combination of textures and tastes.  For main courses, we had the bouillabaisse (seafood stew) and tagliatelle with porcini mushrooms and mascarpone.  The stew was excellent, with many chunks of perfectly-done fish, shrimp, clams, etc.  the stew was wonderfully tasty.  The tagliatelle could have been improved just a bit.  The taste was wonderful.  I would have used a pasta with more body to hold up to the full taste instead of a thin fettuccine that was a tad over poked and not al dente.  But, overall a lovely meal with excellent service."}
{"text":"Had the squid ink linguine and seafood risotto which were both delicious, dessert was also great. Had a Nutella tart and limoncello tiramisu"}
{"text":"Simple Italian food prepared with fresh ingredients.  Fish of the day and squid ink pasts were great."}
{"text":"We were in Montreal the past few days to bring U.S. Thanksgiving to our son who attends college in Montreal and to celebrate our 17 year old's birthday.

MKT was the birthday celebration and they knocked it out of the park.  Staff was top notch.  Atmosphere was upscale but not at all stuffy.  And the food?  Holy heck it was amazing.  The appetizers were wonderful (especially the meatballs and the lamb).  The main courses were phenomenal:  I have the pasta with five smoked meats (or something like that) and I was in heaven.  Two people had fillets; one had pasta, and the final had one of the fish specials.  Everyone was thrilled.

I highly recommend the restaurant.  We will definitely go back on our next visit to Montreal."}
{"text":"Stopped in for dinner on a Wednesday, not busy at all. Meal was excellent. Service was just as good as the meal. Portions are reasonable, a little on the small side, prices are high average. Meals are 25-40+CAD, appetizers/salads are 10-18CAD. I felt like the meal alone wasn't quite enough, I think you are meant to order some appetizers. I also felt like I wanted to lick the plate, the food was truly fantastic. The space is really lovely, a very enjoyable evening all around."}
{"text":"Amazing food quality & taste!  The very freshest ingredients really make a difference.  Sea bass  was awesome.  I have to call out Dominic as a fantastic server who was very attentive, and made excellent recommendations for us.  A wonderful dining experience!"}
{"text":"Came here for mtl a table, where they offered a three course meal for $31.
The atmosphere is relaxed and modern, bordered by neon pink lights. The lighting and noise levels were all just right, making the dining experience extremely comfortable. Service was also fast and courteous, our server explained to us the selections of the day and was really friendly. They served us homemade ciabatta and goat cheese to start, which were extremely impressive. The bread was sooo fresh and pillowy, laced with black olives. 
First, I started off with meatballs and polenta. A real comfort! The meatballs weren't anything special but the dish as a whole was very well balanced. That polenta was sooo creamy and dreamy. I also tried the other appetizers offered, which were the fresh mozzarella with artichoke, and the octopus salad with beans. 
Next, I got the seafood and fish bouillabaisse. This dish showcased a variety of seafood, including salmon, mussels, scallops, clams, squid, and octopus. The flavours tasted rather uniform with the strong broth, but you can tell the seafood was high quality and fresh. I also tried the grilled chicken breast (wonderfully grilled!) and the pasta with wild boar.
For dessert, I got the ricotta and Nutella pie. I always think pies are supposed to be warm so I think I'll call this one a tart. Kind of dry, so I think it could've used something more.
Conclusively, the price for the quality of ingredients offered was phenomenal (at least during the event). Food wasn't mind blowing delicious, but it was a wonderful dining experience and I left satisfied with the meal."}
{"text":"Very nifty Italian restaurant.

Our outing produced one LEGENDARY dish, one very very very good dish, and everything else was superior or very good.

You can't really complain about that.

On the stuff that was merely lovely:

(What follows is a list of warm-up acts).

Fine fine fine olive bread.

A very nifty soft cheese and red peppers to spread on same.

A traditional dark mushroom soup with powerful mushroom taste.

A pleasurable panzanella - which here means cucumber salad with great big croutons.

(Textbook panzanellas have anchovies, but the cook chose to leave them out here. 

Samuel C kills for anchovies but I did not miss them here.)

A comforting salmon tartare.

Farfalle with goat cheese and pesto with addictive pan sauteed pinoli nuts.

I ate the other bitefuls waiting for the next pinoli nut treat.

* * *

Now for the silver prize and the gold legendary trophy:

The Silver Prize is for some of the best french fries I have had EVER.

Now upscale restaurants tend to have really really good french fries.

So no promise that your local French bistro does not make french fries that bring tears to your eyes.

But these babies were pure and unadulterated cocaine.

Potato raised to the highest level of flavor and nobility.

If you were to be reborn as a potato,

and you were to be dug out of the ground - 

you would want to have mkt make a french fry out of you.

Your existence in your life as a potato would have been justified.

* * *

And the envelope please ....

The Gold Legendary award for Awesome and Unique Dessert:

(drum rolls, 

rotating spotlights, 

Katy Perry's hand shaking as she hands the envelope to the emcee ...)

The winner is

THE LEMON TIRAMISU CAKE!

(The crowd roars!)

* * *

I have never had a dessert like the Lemon Tiramisu cake.

It was NOT sweet.

The only function of the sugar was to cut the lemon.

It had a head-filling mouth-filling lemon taste without being either cloying or tart in any way.

It was a cake - but it was light as chiffon.

There was none of the stodge that comes with 

a chocolate layer cake or a banana cake or a red velvet cake.

It was not laden and rich like a tres leches cake.

* * *

This cake floated like a helium balloon and sang its lemon song.

* * *

I floated like a helium balloon and sang my lemon song.

* * *

The world was creamy.

The world was white and yellow.

* * *

Undoubtedly with all that filling, the cake had more than its share of calories.

But it tasted like I was eating a lemon cream breeze without a calorie to its name.

* * *

I will undoubtedly come back to earth tomorrow 

When I weigh myself after all that olive bread, farfalle, french fry and cake.

* * *

But right now, I am flying in a canary colored sky.

Not a bad result for one night at a restaurant."}
{"text":"Food was really good- try the catch of the day. Bread and olive oil was delicious. 

Good service, right in downtown. No parking. Bit loud but good for meetings T lunch."}
{"text":"Loookng for a nice Italian restaurant? This is the place. pretty small sexy restaurant. Great olive bread and cheese to start. I ordered Bouillabaise and my partner ordered risotto with seafood, both were great! In a city with a ton of tourists, it was clear to see that this was a spot that would attract locals. I loved it!,, great ambiance! About 100 per person with bottle of wine and appetizer."}
{"text":"This is a fairly new, upscale hip and modern take on the trattoria. The space is polished and bright and the owner is onsite.    Service was very good - Joe (the owner) helped us with menu selections and even offered to make a single serving of a Branzino that was meant for 2 people when my partner decided he wasn't in on it. Cool space - really enjoyed dinner"}
{"text":"This was a cool spot in an old building just off of Sherbrooke. They have an after 9 special which is what I was most interested in (an appetizer and a main for $26). 

Came on a weekend night and luckily I made reservations as the place was quite backed. It was a very contemporary, bustling environment which pink lighting, marble tables, and comfortable seating. 

The servers were very kind and courteous and seated my party immediately. We all opted for the after 9 special, which gives you the most value for your meal since otherwise each main costs about $26-35. I decided on the soup of the day for my appetizer or entrees (en francais), and the salmon tartar with house fries as my main. 

Oh btw, the menu is in Italian and French for the after 9 special so bear that in mind if you're having trouble translating. The servers are happy to assist you thought with anything. 

Before the appetizers came out, they brought some lovely fresh focaccia with homemade goat cheese. It was absolutely delicious. The appetizers came out piping hot and quite fast. The mains however took a while, but the server gave us some additional bread to tie us over. 

I've heard seafood is well known here, and indeed it did not disappoint. The tartar was delicious and fresh. 

In all, a really great choice for dinner. I'll definitely be back soon!"}

Différents éléments de décor illustrent cette volonté : balance vintage sur étalage de légumes frais, vitrine de gros morceaux de charcuteries en suspension, étal à poissons et fruits de mer frais du jour, cuisine ouverte à la vue des convives.
 
Entre tradition et modernité, une carte d'inspirations italienne et méditerranéenne est proposée aux épicuriens et clientèle d'affaires. Charcuteries en planches ou en sandwiches, huîtres, tartare de buf, ceviche de pétoncles, cocktail de crevettes, gnocchi au gorgonzola, risotto de champignons (notre coup de cur). Au MKT, c'est le produit à l'essentiel. Avec des mélanges de saveurs simples et sans chichis, Marino mise sur le goût.

{"text":"I was invited out for lunch to this place from my FX dealer as I call him. Normally we go for noodles but this time he spoiled me. I guess he is making money from me. 
Service was excellent and always important they speak to me the language of my choice or they lose a star. 
The cream of Mushroom was excellent. I ate it so fast.....
My main meal was the filet Mignon which was also really good just a tad over cooked. But still acceptable. 
the only fault of the place was that there is not salt/pepper and neither for  my soup or meal was I offered and I love my pepper esp. for the soup and did not get any. So that cost time a star!!
Dessert looked good but I try to avoid and did not have any."}
{"text":"Conservative yet modern, Mkt restaurant has a great mediterranean vibe and is definitely a solid business lunch spot after my dear Andiamo (Europea group) closed down. However, the fish is just ok, not as fresh as other \"Real\" market-oriented places in Montreal who use fresher ingredients. Calling it \"Mkt\" might be just an illusion, but go for it if you're just here to talk about business ;)"}
{"text":"Fantastic!! Food, wine, staff (friendliness and knowledge), and ambience were all excellent. Really wish we had discovered this place before our last day of vacation. We will definitely be back for our next trip!"}
