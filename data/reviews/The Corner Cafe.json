{"text":"To be fair, they are better than 'Meh', but aren't quite 'A-OK', so two and a half stars for Corner Cafe (am I breaking a Yelp rule here?!). Let's get it straight, it may resemble 'The Caff' from Eastenders and it's cups and mugs may be mis-matched and ever-so-slightly tea stained from over use, but it does a decent fry up for less than five quid. 

It's all you want after spending the previous night on the tiles and can nay be bothered to cook brekkie. We need more Corner Cafes in my world."}
{"text":"It's alright, I've not grown up in England and therefore I am not nostalgious of \"greasy spoons\", a term I've recently discovered.

At the end of the day (or rather the beginning...or was it the middle?) I couldn't be bothered getting down to the shop to buy stuff and make a fry up myself so I'm quite happy to Corner Caf' it when it comes to it. The girls are nice and the food is quickly on the table and you don't pay a fortune for it.

Can't ask for more"}
{"text":"The corner Cafe is a classic 'greasy spoon' cafe, where a hearty fried breakfast can be consumed on the premises, accompanied (obviously) with a steaming mug of strong tea. Breakfast take-outs in the form of bacon sarnies and other classic breakfast foods. It's as loved by those seeking respite and assisted recovery on the 'morning after' as much as the tradesmen who frequent it. All the classic features pervade this place, from the half-height red gingham curtains that lend to the feel of Ivy's cafe in 'Last of the Summer Wine' to the promo's and meal-deals which are hand-written onto neon bits of card stuck in the windows.

A good sized fry-up and brew is yours for less than a fiver, and I think this is pretty good value for a proper morning-after cure. Give it a go!"}
{"text":"A full English breakfast before a Christmas Eve drink with the lads. Â£4.60 for a huge plateful...everything cooked to perfection. Get down there for a breakfast soon"}
