{"text":"Was craving a salad and came here because of the great reviews. Shared a salad and crepe with a friend -- salad was ok. Lots of ingredients but somehow they didn't go together very well, not flavorful. Crepe was pretty tasteless. Place is very cute but food and service not that great."}
{"text":"This restaurant opened my mind to the whole vegan/gluten-free thing as a dining option.
I mean, I want to be healthy, but I don't want it to be... unpleasant.  Especially when I'm paying for it.  

I got the Soup & Salad Combo of Amazingness that everyone here raves about.  And it was.  It was amazingness.  The soup was hearty and rich.  The salad, deceptively filling.  And so well dressed!  Delicious.  Delicious.  I recommend it v. much."}
{"text":"If you happen to be in Kensington Market this is a great, healthy place to stop for lunch.  Vegan and gluten free and the gluten free crepes are delicious.  I would not come here just to eat at this restaurant but when I am in the neighborhood it's a great place for lunch."}
{"text":"Met a friend for coffee and a sweet there last week and we both loved it! Coffee and teas were tasty as were the delicious vegan squares. Staff is really friendly. A great experience overall!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is delicious! I have been here 3 times and ordered the same thing all 3 times (I'm really not a person of habit, I swear!). I just can't convince myself to order anything else because I am SO blown away by their Soup and Salad combo. It's so deceiving on their menu. All it says is Large Salad (no description) and Soup. What is a Large Salad you ask? Well, it is the most amazing explosion of flavours you will ever taste in a salad. I would list all the ingredients but that would take all the fun out of it for YOU when you go in there and try it for the first time. Make sure you go with someone and you'll both be like, \"whoa, did you know there's ____ in it!\" Seriously. Go."}
{"text":"I got the lunchtime soup/salad combo. It was pretty good, especially the soup, and there was lots of filling stuff in there, but it wasn't quite enough food for me. If I go back I'll get something a bit bigger."}
{"text":"This is a staple for me in the market. It's vegan and gluten-free friendly

They have an amazing salad combo. The salad is not a conventional leafy green salad, but a mix of superfoods and grains. It packs a nutritious and protein punch! Desserts are guilt free and so so satisfying. My favourite is the brownie.

I need to try the buckwheat crepes next time!"}
{"text":"Excellent. New restaurant challenging to find for out-of-towner. Worth call for directions for Sunday afternoon Thai. Enjoy this one Charlotte!!"}
{"text":"I've tried their Pad Thai and Curries, and the taste has been consistent and flavorful every time I've order. Most restaurants who do not specialize on just ONE Asian type of food usually fails miserably as they are not skilled enough on other dishes. But I'm definitely impressed by how authentic their Thai dishes have been, and looking at photos of their Korean, Laos, Japanese, etc. dishes I'm eagerly waiting till the next opportunity to try them myself! Only complaint would be me wanting to hit up Hibiscus during lunch hour and they are not opening until 4pm lol :)"}
{"text":"Great place for all vegan and vegetarians. Their soups and salad bowl are all time favorite. All ice creams are fresh and vegan! A must go place."}
{"text":"Lovely Saturday Lunch - Super Friendly Staff !!
Tom Yum Soup-excellent flavor & lots of perfectly cooked shrimp.  Chicken Larb was delicious, a perfect portion & rice was provided with (most other places rice is ala carte).  Sapporo on draft and a fantastic modern decor make me want to visit again as soon as possible.  Next time I will definitely try the bibimbap."}
{"text":"I was in Kensington Market with my girlfriend on a Friday night, so we decided to stop by Hibiscus and see what all the fuss was about. 

Service: Upon arriving, we weren't greeted by anyone, even though we could see three people working in the back of the restaurant, so we decided to sit down at one of the available tables. After sitting for 5 minutes, with no attention from the staff, I headed to the counter and grabbed a couple of menus to take a look at the options. A few minutes later, someone from the back finally showed up to take our order. Not off to a good start, but whatever. I will note that after we placed our order, the service was good for the rest of the night.

Food: I ordered the brie and pecan crepe ($9), served on gluten-free buckwheat. It was a crunchy, gooey, creamy delight. My girlfriend ordered the tomato, basil, spinach and mushroom crepe ($9), which was also very tasty, but not as good as mine (I win!). We probably would have ordered a salad too, but the waiter informed us they were sold out (!?). It was near closing time, so I suppose this can be forgiven. We did notice the staff head across the street to buy more produce when more customers walked in, and a table of two, who arrived after us, was served salads. WTF.

Price: Our total came to $20, which is pretty reasonable for two people. The crepes were filling and very tasty.

I'd probably give this place 4 stars if the service was better. The crepes are delicious. I've heard the salads are really good too. Hopefully they have them in stock next time!"}
{"text":"Homely is one word to describe Hibiscus. I really like the food  and atmosphere of the place. It's not a cheap to eat there but it's worth it. 
I only order  crepe combo but I'm sure other items are good too. 
One downside is that the cafe is small lol .. I wished they had more tables and space ..."}
{"text":"Passed by this place a million times and never gave it a second thought until I read a review about it on blogTO and decided to try, what could I lose? 

It isn't exactly welcoming on the outside but once you step inside, it is the cutest little cafe ever. The decor gives it a warm feel and it's quiet. There are just a few tables so I'm not sure how coming with a group larger than four would work, but i came just by myself so it didn't matter. 

The menu is small, simple, but pricey. $8 for a small bowl of salad? better be a damn good bowl of salad, which it wasn't. 

I ordered the salad and a tomato, mushroom, spinach crepe. The crepe wasn't bad but it wasn't very exciting either, the salad was fine but definitely not for the price. 

If you're a vegan and on a diet, this place is great for you."}
{"text":"Fantastic Thai lunch today.  I had their Buddha Bowl #1 that included a spring roll, edamame and pad se ew- all for $10.  It was delicious! I will definitely come back often.  

*The only feedback I'd give the manager/owner is to improve the initial scent in the restaurant-- when you first walk in, it smells like they just mopped.  Being clean is great, smelling like a mop bucket is not.  However, once I sat down I didn't notice the smell and once I had my delicious bowl, I'd pretty much forgotten about it."}
{"text":"Expected better
Ordered savoury crepes but wasn't as good as I expected it to be and service was a bit slow
Would maybe return to try the soup and salad"}
{"text":"Their salad is to die for! Seriously, if I had to chose one dish that I had to eat for the rest of my life it would be their salad. The vegan mozzarella crepe was awesome too, I like when vegan/vegetarian places don't drench everything in excessive oil so that's a big plus. 
Even though the atmosphere and the staff were great, I didn't like that the entire place smelled a lot like fried food and after a while I did too. Will still give 5 stars, because OH MY GOD THE SALAD!!!"}
{"text":"Go for the savoury crepe with tomato, basil, vegan cheese, mushroom, and avocado!!! The best thing you will eat all day."}
{"text":"Try the gluten-free brownies - they are amazing!!! Not your usual gluten-free treat! Very nice service and everything is gluten-free if you or a friend has gluten allergies and/or is vegetarian. 

Cute resto to sit down after your Kensington shopping or to take a friend who has never been to the Market before that's more quieter."}
{"text":"This place is unbelievable. Been here three times and can't wait to go back a fourth.

I'm the type of guy who considers a slab of meat the centerpiece of my meal. Hibiscus shakes up my worldview. On the edge of Kensington off College, it's quite tiny but we always seem to manage to get a table without waiting more than a couple minutes. 

They serve incredible vegan and gluten free crepes, and the gingery squash soup is to die for as an appetizer. Going to try the soup and salad combo next visit, as it seems like a bargain, just like everything at this restaurant. A filling lunch for two with a kombucha and dessert came to $30... impressive.

The dessert squares are quite healthy and very rich... peanut butter and chocolate is a favourite. Found the pistachio ice cream to be a bit flavourless but I'll give their other flavours a shot sometime. 

Overall, totally worth dealing with the crackhead who jumped in our path and yelled \"BLEHHH!\" to come here once more. Even better to walk to Moonbean and enjoy a coffee afterwards.

Next time I hear \"vegan\" and \"gluten free,\" I won't be so quick to judge. Hibiscus delivers on all counts with super friendly service and phenomenal food."}
{"text":"If you want a rather guilt free summer treat, Hibiscus cafe holds some of the best icecream in the city. It's dairy free, comes in flavours from coffee to raspberry and is heavenly. 

A small little cafe in Kensington they offer a wide variety of 'dietary friendly' dishes. They hold a little bit of unusual hours but definitely a must stop for healthy eaters who want to indulge in what's good :) A definite fav. in the city."}
{"text":"Hands down the best vegan ice cream in Toronto. Soup salad combo is better than any vegetarian or vegan restaurant. Also, they have an incredible almond milk latte! Based on the extremely low prices and quality; this is my favourite spot to eat in Toronto. Wether your a vegan or just looking for a place to sit down and enjoy a healty meal, you can just taste the love in their food!"}
{"text":"Try the Old Fashioned (not on menu) from the awesome bartender, Roger. The Pad Thai was tasty - spicy and flavorful. Great service. Very attentive. Neat atmosphere at the bar area. Looking forward to trying the other specialty dishes."}
{"text":"Today, my partner and I went to Hibiscus for lunch for the first time. It was busy, but we got a table. The place isn't large, but with high ceilings, a big window out front and a sunny day, it didn't feel too cramped.

The service was sweet and prompt! We had biked quite a bit before lunch, so we drank a lot of water -- our glasses were usually quickly filled. We both ordered the salad and soup combo, the soup was a squash soup. The salad was the star though!  Tofu, beets, yams, chickpeas, lentils, pinto beans, avocado, carrot, green bean; it came at a nice cool temperature (it was like 35 C with humidex today). There is definitely an asian influence to this salad, soy, and sesame oil were flavours I definitely tasted. It is the best and most original salad I've had in a while, my partner agreed.

We shared a scoop of coconut-mango ice-cream, it was pretty good for a non-diary dessert. I didn't taste much of the coconut, but the mango flavour was subtle and certainly tasted of *fresh* mango.

Nice ambiance and servers. For a meal under $10, we were served quickly and had a leisurely meal, staying for almost an hour (unusual for a restaurant in this price range). Hibiscus is the most-cus!"}
{"text":"Love this place. It is run by amazing, kind people. They put their heart and soul in everything they make. Salads and crepes are awesome. Also - try the matcha latte there. Terrific. Overall a great experience. And based on how busy it gets - a lot of people in Toronto think so too."}
{"text":"The pad Thai was tasty, however, the service was horrible. After being seated i was not waited on until I got up to look for the server. The waitress seemed very distracted although there were only two tables full for the lunch hour on a Sunday. Dealing with poor service was a challenge but I did enjoy the pad Thai. It was a bit on the sweet side especially since I order level 5 spicy.... unfortunately it seemed more like level 2.  Overall, I think I would try something different and maybe get takeout next time. It was decent."}
{"text":"This is my FAVORITE cafe in Toronto for lunch. It's located right in Kensington market.

First off, they always play extra soothing film scores (I've heard the Lord of the Rings a few times now) and the atmosphere is so calm and relaxing. 

The best (and most unique) thing on the menu is the Soup and Salad lunch combo. Their salad bowl is a mix of different cold gluten free, vegan and all natural vegetable salads. It's cleansing and so tasty. 

They have a wide variety of Numi teas and Vegan, Gluten free deserts. Seating is limited for lunch hours (probably because it is so popular) so I would say getting there at 11 when they open or after the lunch crowd at 2 or 3 is best."}
{"text":"Love the soup and salad combo. 
Salad is extremely flavourful, filled with different colours, wonderful! 
Soup wasnt my favorite but still complimented the salad.
Also got a spinach mushroom crepe, which I do not recommend as it was slightly bland and compared to the soup an salad combo, not worth it! 
Lastly ordered the earl grey vegan ice cream which was very quite nice, interesting texture and taste, would order again.
Staff was also very friendly, but place was extremely crowded.
All in all, if I would give hibiscus 4.5, but since you can only rate in full stars, hibiscus deserves to be rounded up rather than down ."}
{"text":"Loved the soup and salad combo! The soup of the day was ginger squash, which I love. It was delicious. Not sure if their salad is always the same, but the menu lists some ingredients. Overall, a great lunch with a filling meal.

Their interior is well decorated with cute antiques on the bookshelves/wall. Also, the afternoon jazz in the background made the atmosphere that much more relaxing. Service was great with friendly staff. I'd love to go back for the crepes, heard they're amazing!"}
{"text":"I've only had the soup and salad, but I was thoroughly impressed. It might be hard to settle on a healthy lunch when you're surrounded by gourmet burger shops and tacos in Kensington, but your body will thank you later. For $8, I'd call the soup and salad a little on the expensive side, but the portion size was big and had lots of variety. I'm not a vegetarian, but since it was full of beans and tofu, I wasn't missing meat in the slightest. I had take-out, thankfully in the non-styrofoam containers, and I was served water while I was waiting. Very friendly service.

For comparison, the Hibiscus salad was much tastier than the cold salads at \"Est West Cafe\" http://www.yelp.ca/biz/est-west-cafe-toronto-2 

I'll have to come back a few more times to confirm if it's a 5/5 but I have a strong suspicion that I won't be let down."}
{"text":"Great authentic food. Have to try the Lao sausage with the sticky rice. The sauce that comes with it is awesome and all of them are right on the money.  Papaya salad, duck salad, larb and several other things I've had were excellent as well. I haven't tried the sushi yet though."}
{"text":"I love hibiscus! The pad thai is great. South Park was in desperate need of a good Thai restaurant.  The chicken lettuce wraps are great too. Very authentic and fresh."}
{"text":"I must confess I made the trek to Hibiscus for the dairy free, soy free, ice cream. It was amazing! This is my absolute favourite ice cream place. The staff are friendly, and quite accomodating. The only thing is the portions for the actual food are quite small, but I suppose most vegans and vegetarians tend to be light eaters... I am none of those things. However, I do follow a gluten, dairy, and soy free lifestyle, and for that this place is wonderful."}
{"text":"Hibiscus was such a yummy and healthy little spot!!  I definitely recommend the soup and salad combo; they were both delicious, flavourful, and super filling! And my friends loved the crêpes as well, especially because of the unique flavour of the crêpe dough itself."}
{"text":"Love this place!! So fresh affordable and healthy!! Best vegan in town. Come here both for brunch and lunch!"}
{"text":"My husband is lactose intolerant. The dairy free ice cream here was such a treat. Soooo good. We had the chocolate alomnd and mango coconut. This place is a dream come true for lactose intolerant people!"}
{"text":"Wow, this place is great.

I had their vegan ice cream and a bowl of home-made soup, for like 6$.  It blew my mind.  The portion of vegan ice cream is quite large for a very good price.  The soup is well seasoned, chunky, and both were served in funky ceramic containers.  The service was fantastic - the servers were fast and friendly, but also personable, joking around with me and my friend.  The only weird thing that i encountered is that the washroom is kind of in the back near the kitchen and it feels as if you're using the staff's washroom and that you're not really supposed to be in there.

Oh!  There's also a super cute patio out front which is delightful and very pleasant for an afternoon.  I think this would also be a good \"date\" place."}
{"text":"Great service and great food!! Went here today for lunch and from the moment we walked in were immediately impressed! We were taken away by the beautiful peaceful decor and our server/hostess was great! I went during lunch today with a coworker and we both ordered their boxed lunch where I had the pad Thai with a fried spring roll and fried mushrooms - absolutely delicious!! I will definitely be back again and the lunch special price you can't beat for $10. This place is a must to check out!"}
{"text":"at first I was a little sceptical of hibiscus the service is on the slow side but the delicious crepe I had (mushroom, tomato, goat milk cheese and basil served on buck wheat) was fantastic! They have both savoury and sweet crepes! Something for everyone! I really recommend it if you're in the mood for something healthy but still want something filling."}
{"text":"Authentic mouth watering kalbi and Kimchi.  My new favorite comfort food place.  Everyone who lives Korean food should go!  Next time will try Thai."}
{"text":"Vegans and vegetarians welcome to paradise. Amazingly flavourful 5 salad special with a mug of ginger squash soup for $9. My friend had the apple crepe and she loved it. 

Its a small place so it can get crowded. Service was good. 

Ive been there a couple of times and its simple, delicious and healthy food."}
{"text":"It was very beautifully presented and tasty.  Something I wish I would cook for myself.  I am not really a vegan but I like vegetables. The only criticism I would say is that the serving size of the salad and soup combined is too big. With 70%-30% of carb to veg ratio."}
{"text":"Another plug for the soup and salad combo!

My soup was the squash and ginger, and the \"salad\" is probably better described as a \"bowl of vegetarian goodies.\" Their quinoa is delicious, and the tofu/beets/lentils/carrots/sweet potato make for a great combination of textures.

Tiny size means even seating three people can be a stretch, but makes for personable service.

Sadly their hours are really only conducive to lunch, which brought me to King's Cafe (http://www.yelp.ca/biz/kings-cafe-toronto#hrid:kyFZxa1RnlcANx3f-YDpOQ) one tragic evening. They're not even in the same league!

$10 for one person."}
{"text":"Honestly, I have been wanting to try this place for the longest time! I finally decided to make the trek one day to get it=let me tell you, it was hard passing by all of the amazing food places on Kensington in favour of a vegan, but I was determined to try a healthier option. I decided to order the salad and soup combo, and also get a little vegan almond square with it to go. 

The salad was VERY disappointing. Upon first bite, I was expecting something amazing, like other reviews have said. It tasted pretty good and promising, so I continued eating. After a few bites, however, it all went downhill. Each bite started to get worse, and I honestly started getting sick of the salad and felt it all tasted the same- which is crazy, because it's supposed to have 42 ingredients in it! I couldn't even make it halfway through before tossing it out, and I felt kind of nauseated and sick afterwards. Isn't such healthy 'vegan' food supposed to make you feel better and taste good, judging by what everyone else says? It's honestly deterred me from trying other hyped vegan food in the future. I'll stick to my basic fruits and vegetables.

The soup was really bland and watery as well, which was also pretty sad. The only highlight- and reason I give this place a star is because the almond square was absolutely delicious! Even the square however was a little too much after a few bites- you're better off sharing it or just taking a sample, since it's super sweet and strong. It also also all came down to $20, which is way too much for a meal that tasted so horrid. I feel really bad, because I REALLY wanted to like this place. The crepes looked good, but after that salad I'm deterred from trying another item from this place again."}
{"text":"I was really hoping the negative reviews would be a little off, but they weren't.  The papaya salad was bland with no spices and not spicy at all!  It was just a lot of fish sauce and shredded papaya.  The green and red curry dishes were also very bland without any spices and the chicken and pork were rock hard.  We had to add the red chili sauce to the curry that came with the lettuce wraps.  The lettuce wraps were gooey and also bland.  The steak salad was in fact spicy and I asked for dressing on the side, but the dressing was already on the salad.  The steak was tough.  There's nothing \"Thai\" about this place.  I love Thai food and have been to numerous Thai restaurants and this was by far the worst Thai restaurant I've tried. Very disappointing."}
{"text":"Love this place. Tried it on Friday and went back on Saturday. Lettuce wraps and edamame to start and they were both perfect. Had the rainbow sushi roll and it was fabulous. Friend had a spicy beef starry and other has best fried rice ever with chicken and shrimp. So glad to have this little spot tucked into Woodlawn and Park road. Interior is nicely done as well. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Had a great waiter and waitress serve my family and friends and answered all of my questions about Thai food. They seated us outside in the warm, night weather and even though it was late, their energy was great as they set up tables with pretty placemats. They also told us how many servings were in an order so we would have enough to share amongst ourselves. I got the Pad See Yew and it was SUPER delicious and they did not completely drench the noodles with overwhelming sauce like Thai House at University did so you could still enjoy the dish without having to eat rice or vegetables every other bite to balance the strong taste out. If it wasn't so far away from my house, I would come back and eat here more often! Customer service was great as they attended to our needs speedily and were generous enough to bring us an extra bowl of rice for our Bulgogi, which was also delicious. Wish I caught their names to personally tell them they made Hibiscus one of my new favorite Thai places in Charlotte! Definitely a great place to go to for dinner!"}
{"text":"Excruciatingly slow service - we waited more than half an hour for two crepes, which ended up being mediocre. Definitely not worth the price. The atmosphere was charming, though."}
{"text":"We ordered steamed dumplings, spring rolls, and chicken+shrimp pad thai.  All were delicious. Would recommend and will be back."}
{"text":"A good Asian fusion place at the bottom of the shopping center on Park and Woodlawn. Get the pad see ewe or the green curry. The ginger stir fry is also good.  The Korean dishes are also good. Lettuce wraps- not so much. 
Owners r half Thai half Lao and one is married to a Korean woman so they know their menu. 
You can eat outside as well."}
{"text":"Excellent spring rolls, Korean barbQ +service in a small footprint with nice ambiance. The chef/owner is the son of the owners of Thai Taste and wanted to try a hand a his ideas for a pan-Asian restaurant. We will be back."}
{"text":"All I could really ask for. The vegan crepes were so nice, ad was everyone who works here. The wireless Internet was fast, and they didn't mind at all that my friend and I sat for a long time with our laptops sipping coffee (probs in part because it wasn't that busy). We also had the cashew butter bar which was insanely delicious. A very very pleasant chill vegan coffee&dessert experience!"}
{"text":"This was a great small, quiet place when we had dinner there last night. Prompt and good service from limited friendly staff. Good food, stout drinks. Defintiely going back."}
{"text":"The other reviews really have it covered - Hibiscus is amazing! Great vegan/vegetarian and gluten-free-friendly food at very affordable prices. The soup + salad deal is the best lunch in the city. You get a mug of their freshly made soup (always vegan) and a bowl of their salad. And when I say salad, I don't mean a bunch of wilted greens on a plate! No, their salad is a mixture of many other salads - quinoa, beans, carrots, seeds, beets, tofu, and all kinds of other great stuff. 

They also have crepes on the menu, which are great. And they're happy to substitute ingredients for you if you want. Most of the savory crepes are not vegan as written, but it's easy to just ask them to leave out the cheese or sub-in another vegetable. They're happy to accommodate. 

The staff are also very friendly and not pushy. I've seen many people go in there with laptops to get a little work done while they have lunch and then sip a coffee or tea for an hour or two. 

They also have what looks to be amazing, vegan ice cream. I admit I have not tried it yet but everyone else who I've seen order it seems to really enjoy it.

Absolutely worth checking out, even if you're not vegetarian or vegan!"}
{"text":"The cheap & cheerful factor was high. The vibe was chill. 

I went for a soup (ginger squash) & salad combo. It's a mug of soup and a power-ingredient filled salad. It's almost like they googled super-foods and threw it all in with a bit of sesame oil. It worked because I needed it this particular day but kind of entertaining in lack of focus. A very dense & satisfying meal. 

The only trouble was they weren't able to keep up with their seating & walk-in capacity. It was strangely slow to get the meal & strangely slow to be able to pay for it. 

Maybe I was in a rush and shouldn't have been. I dig it, and will return for the food."}
{"text":"awesome!!! I could eat these salads everyday! The soup is also delicious and the crepes are great (huge though - we always share). Always very shocked at how cheap the bill is and the prices include tax which I LOVE"}
{"text":"Talk about the wisdom of crowds! I came to Hibiscus knowing only two things: 1. that it had received very good reviews on Yelp and 2. that the soup and salad combo was considered a winner by many Yelpers. I'm happy to report that everyone was spot-on!

I had the buckwheat crepe with chutney and pecans. It was dee-licious! - moist, flavourful, bursting with greens, yet structurally sound (not floppy and falling apart as some crepes are wont to do). A real winner.

My mom had the soup and salad combo, and she was verrry impressed. My mom eats macrobiotic (read: up-tight, crazy-healthy vegetarian - loveyoumom!), and she was prepared for a so-so meal, but she was pleasantly surprised. She was so impressed that the salad was substantial and had a lot of variety (she counted four types of beans alone: green lentils, black beans, kidney beans, chickpeas) and didn't overdo it with the sauce. It was well-balanced, healthful, and light. 

The grand total for the two of us, including a chai latte (lukewarm, but with nice, subtle flavour) came to $21.69. I consider that a very good price for what we had! I will definitely be back!

Note that the interior is small and somewhat cramped, but the service is down to earth and friendly. If you're seated next to loud talkers, brace yourself or join the conversation. For this reason, try going during off-hours to avoid a wait or get take-out."}
{"text":"This is my new mother/daughter lunch date place. I haven't had a crepe in approximately one million years and my lunch here was so lovely and delicious. My mom really enjoyed her food too - she talks about it all the time. She's totally in love. 

Small, charming little place. A gem."}
{"text":"My rating is 3.5/5.

I think one of the greatest misnomers about Vegan food is that you will leave the table hungry. This is far from the case at Hibiscus Cafe.

I ordered the Soup and Salad combo which seems to be one of the more popular options here. The soup of the day was Carrot/Ginger, and came served in a mug. The soup was too thick and totally under seasoned, but the flavours of carrot and ginger were harmonious. I could have benefited from a salt shaker at the table.

The salad was quite interesting, and it was fun trying to decipher all the elements that went into it: Marinated Tofu, Beets, Carrots, Sweet Potato, Beans, Quinoa, Kale, and Tofu Ricotta were a few of the items I think were included.

Half way through the salad, I couldn't do it any more. I was so full! Go figure. 

It was definitely a lunch that I didn't feel guilty about consuming, however I would definitely switch it up the next time I visit and try the Crepes instead."}
{"text":"This place is really amazing. Unpretentious, simple, delicious food. I started frequenting Hibiscus after a month long exam period where all I was eating was greasy Chinese food from Chinatown or the Chinese trucks at U of T. It was really a refreshing change to have a nice soup + salad combo, I felt like it just brought me back to life. One word that I think describes this combo is hearty (and yummy). Their salad is great, with about 7 ingredients, it's not just a regular greens salad with dressing. There are lentils, broccoli, avocado, beets, tofu... and more, and it is full of flavour!!! I've only ever had their butternut squash soup here and I loved it (but there is rarely a soup I have come across that I don't love). I've also had their crepes here, and while these are also good, I find them to be pretty small and lack the value that you get from the soup + salad combo. 

Service is spectacular. Everyone that works there is just so genuinely nice and super attentive. The atmosphere is warm, comfortable and just...peaceful. In the afternoons, it tends to get quite a bit of sunlight, so a seat by the window is definitely key. 

Fun (creep) fact: Daria Werbowy has been seen at this spot. 

Go here please, you won't regret it."}
{"text":"Only been here once and had the soup + salad combo. I had the order to go, and they were just starting to make a new batch of soup since the last one sold out. While I was waiting, I had a couple people check up on me and ask if I wanted water and that my order will take a few minutes. Anyway, I received my order and they were really apologetic that I had to wait that long (which I didn't really). They gave me complimentary cookies which was really nice. :) Oh, the soup and salad was delicious as well! My vegetable-hating bf loved the salad! Can't wait to try the crepes."}
{"text":"I ate savoury crapes with vegan mozzarella, tomato, basil, spinach, mushroom and was so satisfied with the quality of it. Couldn't believe it's vegan cheese! I definitely will come again~~ By the way I originally wanted to try salad and soup combo, but the portion looked kinda small, so I tried the crapes.

On more thing is the homemade vegan ice creams were amazing, especially PISTACHIO!!!!!!!!! I ate 1 scoop and wanted to eat more, so I take out 1 scoop more even though it's winter now and so cold outside....lol
It's not so creamy like typical ice creams, but it contains a lot of chunks inside and so delicious omg T_T)b

I went there this lunch time and it was quite busy and the restaurant is kinda small. You might have to wait. BUT it's worth it. :D"}
{"text":"I have been going to this restaurant pretty regularly since 2008. Please keep that in mind while you read this, so you know where I'm coming from and that I'm not just some random person who went here once and is just trying to start shit. 
 
I'm an incredibly lactose intolerant person. I know my body, I know my allergies; it's pretty much like clockwork. I ask for a drink with soy. Within 30-45 minutes, I am violently sick in the bathroom - not once but twice (in an unobtrusive way). I feel like I am going to die, but I still want to stay and chat with my friend, so once my symptoms pass as I know they will if they are what I think they are, we stick around for another few hours, my friend still working on their beverage. 

I know exactly how my body reacts to lactose - and that is how it reacted today. Lactose intolerance for me has always ever happened within 30-45 minutes of ingesting something that has been exposed to lactose. I talk with the counter staff when we pay and I tell them my drink made me sick, it's on the table half-consumed, I was hoping it could be taken off my bill. The staff then engage me in an aggressive and accusatory conversation that was inappropriate, unnecessary, too long, and made me feel attacked and uncomfortable. 

I had one person tell me that they remembered the drink being made with soy, even though it was during a lunch rush 3 and a half hours ago - busy enough that people came in, looked at the crowd, and left because it was too busy. I have a really hard time believing that people have that good of a memory for something that happened that long ago in a busy restaurant when tons of other drinks are made and everyone is multitasking. Also, while the place serves vegan food it is not an entirely vegan place. There is non-vegan milk and so there is always the risk of cross-contamination. I don't know what happened, maybe they didn't rinse the nozzle thing between dairy and non-dairy lattes or something. We are all human. But that kind of cross-contamination, while it might seem minor, is something I notice because it makes me sick. 

More staff and the owner were getting up in my face. First, they decided to lecture me about how the restaurant is \"very good\" and has a \"very good reputation\" and \"we use all good organic ingredients\" and they \"take allergies very seriously\" and are \"absolutely positive\" no mistakes were made on their part. I had a matcha latte, and they decided to tell me how the matcha was ceremonial grade and it was $30 for a teeny tiny little package. They put the package in my hand for me to look at. The fuck? They continued to talk about their excellent reputation and how they take allergies and cross contamination very seriously and how dare I question that blah blah blah.

They then proceed to tell me it must have been something I ate earlier in the day. I tell them I didn't eat anything else that day, and they said, \"oh, well that must be why you were sick then.\" Uh, what? You want me to tell you exactly when I woke up and exactly what I ate all day so you can try to convince me that you know better than I do how dairy interacts with my intestines? Really? And then to lecture me about how good your restaurant is? Are you fucking kidding me? Well, apparently your reputation isn't more important than arguing with me in front of your entire restaurant for way to long about a $4 latte.

When something like this happens, the appropriate thing to do is to apologize. If you don't know how any cross contamination happened, you can say that, but if you aren't a completely dairy-free place you absolutely cannot guarantee it. Refund my drink (which they eventually did after this entire fucking kerfuffle) without taking up more of my time, and apologize that my experience was unpleasant. Don't lecture me about how good your restaurant is. Don't ask me what else I ate during the day. Honestly. Just fucking don't. If you say you are sympathetic to people with allergies and food restrictions, this is NOT how to prove it.

Over the years many of the prices have more than doubled, and while the recipes are more or less the same the portions are a little less than they used to be, esp with crepe filling. It went from being a place where you could get a $25 meal for 2 people (incl drinks) and now you can get a crepe and a latte for $20. Inflation is a thing but that price shift is fucking crazy. I miss the original owner and the original care and family-run vibe and coziness that attracted me to the place way back when. Since new ownership I've noticed downward slide in quality across the board in terms of food and experience and so I've gone there less and less over the years. 

I will not be coming back here, ever, under any circumstances, unless there's new management. This kind of staff training and behaviour on the part of the owner is completely inappropriate and insensitive, esp when you are a common go-to spot for people with food sensitivities. TRY AGAIN."}
{"text":"Finally got around to having lunch here, and it is just as wonderful as their ice cream. Their soup and salad combo is phenom and great value (about $9) - the salad bowls are a composite of what's fresh in their kitchen that day with nary a cheapo ice berg lettuce to be found, all served with a fascinating raw cracker. Soups of the day vary, and on this hot summer afternoon the choices were between a chilled melon soup or housemade miso.

My friend went for the crepe, which did come, as we were warned, with quite a wait time, so if you're in a rush, avoid the crepe options. (Albeit, it is definitely worth it if you have the time, or at least some good company to whittle the time away with).

Service, friendly and homey. Atmosphere is cozy. Lots of people swinging in for ice cream on the go or for pickup. Food is excellent. My favourite summer food destination of 2010."}
{"text":"The best red curry we ever had! Very neat, clean, and friendly. Did not mind that we had a baby with us. If you are in the area, it is definitely a must stop place. So good! We will be back!"}
{"text":"I base my review on the best salad I've ever had - an incredible blend of goji berries, broccoli, lentils, quinoa, cranberries, tofu, in a generous bowl.

The staff was friendly and helpful, even though the place was madly busy. 

My 5-year-old daughter, who can't eat wheat or dairy, was thrilled to have her first ice cream cone. 

5 stars for the intangibles - a place that makes you feel good to hang out in, with food that leaves you satisfied and happy."}
{"text":"Wow, so delicious! The soup and salad combo is out of this world in flavour and healthiness. Love the combination of grains, vegetables, nuts, greens, even a few noodles. Haven't eaten anything else. Brought my mom here and she loved it too. Sweet service and unpretentious decor, with some incredibly beautiful Raku pottery in display."}
{"text":"This is one of those what if places. Thai Taste on East Blvd is a venerable Thai restaurant in Charlotte. I bet it has been there 25 years, tried and true, few surprises and few disappointments. What if it blasted into the current century and picked up a whole lot of the cool trendy influences of the last 20 years, like sushi and Vietnamese food and some things you're not real sure of where they are from but they taste good. This place is run by the same family as Thai Taste, their kids I understand and these kids have certainly been paying attention the restaurant trends over the years. The food offers great selection, reasonable prices (especially the wine list) . Atmosphere is slick and staff is friendly and knowledgeable about the menu. I wasn't real sure what I was ordering but I would go back in a heartbeat. It's different and that is harder and harder to find."}
{"text":"We tried Hibiscus for the first time last night and were pleasantly surprised. I had actually avoided trying out Hibiscus because it seemed like yet another Asian restaurant in Charlotte trying to boil the ocean (er, continent) with Korean, Thai, and sushi. Amazingly, they seemed to do it all well, though we didn't order the sushi on this trip. 

We had the bibimbap and the ginger stir fry. Both were flavorful, came out quickly, and the kimchi side was perfect. The staff was friendly, attentive, and did a great job with the table side presentation -- several tables near us ordered the flaming sushi dish. Can't wait to go back and try more of their menu!"}
{"text":"Very refreshing place with a simple menu. Had the 42 ingredient salad and the savoury crepes. The tastes were light and not overpowering, which offers a great \"cleanse\" when you feel like you've got to get some veggies in your system. They don't overpower you with oil or salt, which made this such a great spot."}
{"text":"This is SUCH a cute little place!! I love it!! It was kind of hard to find though... or maybe it's just me haha.  My sister and I walked up and down the street several times before we were able to find it :/.  But yea we ordered the salad and soup combo for lunch thinking that it wouldn't be too filling cause we didn't want to be too full. But man...It's a good enough lunch for a really hungry person lol. There were so many diff grains and veggies in the salad..it was amazing!! And the soup... The best pumpkin soup ever :)"}
{"text":"Soup and salad combo was great! Slightly pricey - 16.50 +tax but lots of food. The soup was the highlight for me - sweet potato coconut. Really really tasty! Cute place for veggie/gluten free!"}
{"text":"I had a espresso and a crape form here a while ago, and i still dream of that espresso every time I take a slug of the over priced crud from starsmucks... I'm going to go back to Toronto just for this place."}
{"text":"Read the reviews, came, could not be more disappointed
I guess someone should mention that this is a vegan place and therefor food is not tasty
Above all, the place does not have a good service

Very disappointing"}
{"text":"Wonderful Fresh Ginger stir fry. Awesome Bulgogi. Very good spider roll sushi. Great atmosphere. Attentive staff.  Good wine selection. Quick service. All around terrific dining experience."}
{"text":"This accidental find of a hidden gem called Hibiscus got Asian fusion right. Located on the lower level of the shopping complex off Wendover and Park Road in Charlotte, its ambience setting provides a warm vibe. But let's get to the point as to why we came here. The food. It is so hard to please my husband when we go out to eat because he feels my home cooked meals are always best. Which is true, but since it was our 18th year anniversary we decided to try this Southeast Asian restaurant. His verdict - He LOVED everything. This is a great restaurant for groups when everyone wants a variety. They have Korean, Laotian, Vietnamese, and Japanese. Here are the pictures of our dishes. By the way, service was superb and our dishes came out in perfect timing. We spent a full hour in the restaurant from sit down to leaving completely satisfied. Please go support this local restaurant, you will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"I consider myself as a carnivore. Sure, I eat veggies once in a while, but have I ever enjoyed it as much as when I eat meat? Hell no, because if you're not eating winter veggies in Toronto, 99% of what you're eating is probably not fresh. The salad at Hibiscus however, is just so fresh. I could eat it everyday if my wallet permits.

Service is also one of the reasons why I love this place. So, I found a rubber inside my salad. What do most waiters do in Toronto? They will just say \"Oh...\" and went on with their business. At Hibiscus however, they decided that they will let me eat for free when they found out about it!!! I know that it's kind of a common sense to do it, but believe me! This is the first time I get 5-star service when eating out in Toronto. I will definitely  come back and definitely recommend you guys to my friends."}
{"text":"Gluten free goodness in every bite!! Choose savoury or sweet melt in your mouth crepes as made in cafes that I visited in Paris. Or skip them all together for a salad reaping with organic vegetables. Whatever you choose you will not be disappointed. Bon Appetite!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped by Hibiscus on Sunday evening to check it out for the first time. We were seated in the back area at a comfy booth.

For drinks, I got the House Concoction (not completely sure what was in it but it was delish) and my hubby got a beer. They also had a decent Sake list if that's your thing. 

We started with some edamame as an app. Nice portion and perfectly salted. For our meal, we got the red curry chicken and the crunchy dragon roll. The red curry was perfectly flavored. The sushi roll was my absolute favorite though. I thought the fish tasted real fresh. Easily one of the best rolls I have had in a while!

So excited that Hibiscus is now a part of this Montford food and drink scene!"}
{"text":"Friendly wait staff, attentive, and helpful. The food was presented with a fun flourish of avocado and zucchini. I love creative garnish. We're talking savory crepes here."}
{"text":"Had soup and salad and it was amazing! Only 9 dollars ish and the quality was fantastic!! Highly recommended ,even you are not vegetarians!"}
{"text":"Terrific food, great service! My daughter ordered Korean food and my husband, son and I ordered Thai food. We were all pleased with our dishes. The atmosphere is top notch!"}
{"text":"This simple unpretentious micro-restaurant is a fantastic spot for veggies and vegans to bring their omnivorous friends. Not because of the availability of animal products; just because they wont actually miss them! 

Hibiscus was on my list of spots to take my BVF when she was in town and I had planned for that to be my first time trying the restaurant.   Fate intervened in the form of a fairly random meeting with someone from U of T who, as a vegan, suggested it for coffee + desert.  The selection of sweets was quite impressive for such a diminutive establishment; there were about a dozen different varieties of sweet crepes, a nice assortment of dairy-free ice cream, and a reasonable selection of baked goods.  While the crepes all sounded good, I am a sucker for high quality pistachio ice cream.  Wow!  This wasn't a mere simulation - this stuff was excellent - full of pieces of nuts, just the right balance of sweet and savoury and a shockingly luxurious mouth feel considering the absence of dairy.  One bite moved them to the top of the BVF list.

Took the BVF here a few weeks later and she was an instant fan.  We each had the mixed salad which was beyond excellent.  Seriosuly, I don't know what they do to it, but it transcends mortal salads.  Vegan Schmegan - it's worth going if you even remotely enjoy salad.  We both had crepes - I went for wild mushroom - she for concentrated sweetness.  Both were excellent and defy logic - how do you get light fluffy crepes without eggs?  Thankfully, they know.  Of course, we were too full for desert.. but had some anyway.  Yes, ever the creature of habit I had the pistachio ice cream again and it was still great.  She had an assortment of ice cream and was REALLY impressed.  

We spent a bit of time chatting with one of the owners as we settled up - this is really a passion project for them and it shows in every bite.  He graciously offered us some baked treats - date square and cookies - which we took to go.  OK - We ate them in the damn taxi, happy?

Perhaps the only negative is the service.  While quite pleasant and attentive, it can exceedingly slow.  If you've got to be somewhere at a specific time (theatre) you either want to give yourself a head start or (regretably) chose another venue.  The other is availability.  This is a really small place - 5 tables.  You could wait awhile just to get in...but it is so worth the wait."}
{"text":"Great food & drinks. Just a heads up for parents, when we went this past Friday they did not have high chairs which made eating with our daughter pretty interesting. Not complaining just wanted to put it out there."}
{"text":"You're missing out if you haven't eaten here.  Your taste buds are in for a treat.  Superb!"}
{"text":"Yum Yum Yum Yum...

I've been coming here for about a year, and I must say I have been impressed every time:). 5/5 for wonderful servers/owner, 5/5 for ambiance, but most importantly 5++/5 for food from the lovely salade bowl to crepes to the-best-ice-cream-i've-ever-had-and-it's-even-diary-free!!  I even once sat next to a celebrity here (Rachel McAdams right before Sherlock Holmes came out~ no I didn't talk to her, I was taken by the food, and I let her enjoy her meal with her friend :) )....  Honestly one of the best restos in Toronto, and I'm not even a vegetarian."}
{"text":"LOVE this tiny spot in Kensington Market! all the vegan dishes are really good, tasty! the soup here is amazing too, a good spot to stop by after shopping nearby"}
{"text":"Very cute little vegetarian spot. Always busy and only a handful of tables. Their Salad Bowl is the healthiest and most flavourful salad you will ever have. Not kidding. Please try it. You will then know what food is supposed to taste like. Their squash soup pales in comparison. Vegan and vegetarian crepes available. Simple flavours but good."}
{"text":"You know the ambiance is great ... They had good service...  But...  We ordered a dish without shrimp paste that they put shrimp in...  The menu didn't say it had shrimp. Scatterbrained. Fried rice had no flavor.... Very anemic. Overpriced Thai Teas.  Red Curry was good but portion size wasn't worth 14 bucks. They have to get a better menu. Thom Ka was was watered down and salty."}
{"text":"SOLID 4.5
My husband surprised me for our anniversary and brought me here. I love Thai food and being from Hawaii I miss good Asian food.  So many times when enjoyed on the mainland, many places add fillers like baby corn, bell peppers and peas.
 
We sat in a comfy booth which is a nice change from the bar-our usual real estate. They have bar seating as well. I asked a few questions of our server and discovered they serve local craft brews, able to customize orders and they have STICKY rice for $2, What?!!!???! So at this point I am freakin' excited.  I high fived my husband and began dancing in my seat. Of course, the awesome club music playing assisted with my elation. 

We started off with a couple craft beers and fried dumplings. DELICIOUS! Our entrees consisted of green curry sans peas and bibimpap. And don't forget the sticky rice! Food arrived! Everything looked great. I was a bit confused when the waiter did not mix the bibimpap. He mentioned something about presentation, which I understand; however, I am accustomed to it being served in a hearty stone bowl with rice and all the fixings.  It comes to the table unmixed (hence presentation) the server asks how hot you want it and adds the appropriate red sauce, mixes it, pushes the concoction against the sides of the hot stone bowl.  Wait a little and the result is crispy goodness.  Here there is no rice and the type of bowl doesn't allow for crispy-ness.  Don't get me wrong, it was tasty just not what I thought I was getting.  Everything tasted great and I was able to exercise my mad chopstick skills. 

We decided to take egg rolls to go.  Now we got yummy leftovers.  I love this place. I will adjust being on the mainland and all, but this place definitely deserves a visit for those \"traditional\" Asian food lovers.  You know, those who have not experienced the food in the Pacific Rim."}
{"text":"This place was awesome! The waiters were friendly and the restaurant was simplistically funished. Overall, a great atmosphere for dining.

I went with a friend of mine and we both got the salad-soup combo and shared a lemon crepe. The combo was just over $10, but worth every dollar. I would recommend sharing the combo; both my friend and I couldn't finish -the portion didn't seem like much, but filled us up quickly. The salad was flavourful and delicious; the soup/cracker was complimentary and fantastic. The crepe was good, but I wasn't a bad fan of the texture (since it was gluten free, there were many seeds and substitutes). 

I've just started phasing into a pescatarian lifestyle, so they place was perfect! However, I think meat lovers would enjoy this place just as much! With healthy and nutritious meals and an awesome customer experience; I rated this restaurant 5/5."}
{"text":"A comfy little spot tucked away from the noise. Polite, helpful service with good suggestions on food and sharing portions. We had the Bibimbap and the papaya salad and both were flavorful and presented well on their serving plates. The side pickles were a great compliment to the bibimbap. 

Looking forward to exploring the rest of the menu on our next visits."}
{"text":"In my experience it's rather difficult to get excited about a salad, so when that many people rave about one, that salad must be something special. It certainly tasted amazing! I have no idea what they did to make all of the 42 ingredients blend together so well, but it worked - and the result is this awesome explosion of flavour and texture. My friend looked very sceptical when I professed my love for it, so I offered her a bite...and enjoyed her reaction. :P

Can't really comment on service or anything else, given that it's pretty much their first few weeks at this location and there are no lines (yet). I would say that the food is worth a try though :)"}
{"text":"Very tiny restaurant but friendly service and yummy food!
The menu is very limited but the food tastes good!
The Laos sausage was my husband's favorite!
I personally love their noodle soups, they are all delicious!"}
{"text":"Excellent Thai food! Our favorite in Charlotte! The red and panang curries are my fav, and the hubby loves the pad thai. Can't go wrong!"}
{"text":"They're 40+ ingredients salad is the best. It's so fresh and makes you full. But if you're still hungry I recommend to get the combo where you get a soup of the day. 
Of all the healthy options in Kensington Market this one is probably the best. It's not so pricey and they have a nice small cute patio where you can eat"}
{"text":"cute, intimate interior and a very cute makeshift patio. staff were very friendly and  accommodating. I bought the soup and salad combo, which is great value at twelve dollars, and very tasty 42 ingredients full of vegan goodness and the soup on the side put it over the top. I also had a green tea coconut milk ice cream for dessert which was divine.

all in all, hibiscus is a hidden gem in Kensington market, and well worth the value. I will definitely be visiting again."}
{"text":"Went in for lunch with a friend and we were definitely impressed! We ordered the Bangkok curry noodle, papaya salad, and the Laos sausage with sticky rice. The food is authentic and it hit the spot! The staff were very friendly as well. Can't wait to go back and try the rest of the menu."}
{"text":"Loved it! Usually skeptical of thai/korean/viet places,  but hibiscus broke the mold. 

Had the bibimbap and Thai tea.  Both were on point.  Definitely coming back and can't wait to try more of the menu. Lived in Charlotte for two years and this is probably the best all around asian food I've had."}
{"text":"Great ambience and environment

Had the bulgogi and the flavor profile was a bit off, meat was more salty than sweet"}
{"text":"The restaurant itself is little bit hidden, my friend and I had walked past it 3 times while searching for it, but the food was great. We both had a salad, it was super filling and delicious. Great service too!"}
{"text":"I LOVE this place. Excuse my excitement as I explain why this place is so awesome. *clears throat. 

This little hidden gem in Kensington Market is to die for. I promise you. Everything on the menus is organic, fresh and made with love. The salads are packed with so much goodness and flavor. It's mouth watering. I wish I could eat this clean everyday (if I lived in town I would be). Definitely my favorite spot in the Market to grab a quick bit that fills me up and also makes me feel good. 

I ordered the large soup and salad with a chai tea latte."}
{"text":"10/10 restaurant.  Great addition to Charlotte food scene.  Don't hesitate to come in.  Try the Grandma's Bimbimbap and the Poke.  A+++++ place."}
{"text":"I'm glad this was my first vegan dining experience. Hibiscus' food lives up to its reputation and I confess, as a lover of meat, that if we somehow ran out of steak and ribs, I'll be just fine.  My wife reminds me all the time that I need to eat better and think about my health, so having more diverse, healthy options in the city, I'll be happy to oblige. We enjoyed our salad, broccoli soup, vegan crepe and dairy-free ice cream. :)"}
{"text":"\"The salad is packed with awesome stuff,\" -waiter. 
It's true, it is. Quinoa, lentils, green beans, sweet potato, tofu, carrot hash, broccoli, beets, sesame seeds, etc ... The grains are quite filling and you almost feel healthier consuming it.

I also grabbed the soup, which ended up being a squash purée with (lots of!) ginger. Was served in a mug and ended up being a great addition to the meal.

Based on this visit, I would have rated it higher, but I've heard they're crepes aren't special. Stick with the 'awesome stuff' salad."}
{"text":"Excellent food, very filling, great customer service. Everything I had was very tasty and well prepared. Will def be back!"}
{"text":"Ordered the lunch specials..

Pad Thai - Strange, off tasting. Totally unexpected in a not so nice way flavor. 

Bulgogi - my friend said it was ok, wouldn't order it again! It wasn't authentic


The ambiance was nice.  The spring rolls, edamame, and rice were good!!"}
{"text":"So happy to have a new Asian restaurant in the area! Service and food was spectacular. Our favorite was the red curry! We will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Fantastic Korean food in Charlotte! Hoorah! I have loved asian restaurants in Charlotte, however Korean places were lacking until recently. Yay for Hibiscus!! I am thrilled to find this new place with Korean bibimbap--authentic sides too!!  The beef bibimbap tasted amazing with traditional sides like pickled cucumbers and kimchee--yippee!! They tasted delicious. Bibimbap has beef, vegetables, rice, spicy sauce and an egg. The nice service even included more sides and special gochujang sauce! Worth the $16 because you have leftovers.

I also tried the steamed dumplings app and found them flavorful but there were only four in the order. So being a dumplings fan, I would have trouble sharing:). The ginger tea was the special tea forte kind I love! I'm going back again soon to try the sushi and the thai. (Parking is in the lot above near jason's deli.)"}
{"text":"I don't know why everyone is raving about this place. It's okay it's not the best they have very little selection of meals on there menu although I have to say there mozzarella mushroom and basil crepe is delicious so and the banana walnut is good aswell. I also got the chance to try there chocolate almond square, lemon poppyseed, double chocolate and pistachio vegan cookies which were amazing especially for vegan ingredients. I would not come back again but there baked goods were good."}
{"text":"Visited Kensington market on a Friday afternoon & this was our first stop!

Service: 5/5 

Ambiance: its a very small place, so be prepared to sit very closely to people next to you. Two bathrooms inside. 

Food: $$, but well worth trying. It was ~$29 for large salad + 2 cups of soup + tea. 

 Got the 42 ingredient salad + soup (mushroom) and man oh man!!!!! It was so good!!!! Very very clean eating without feeling guility at all. Vegetarians dream! 

Highly recommend eating here at least once!"}
{"text":"This review is based solely on the ice cream here, as that is all that I've had. Admittedly it's not super-cheap, but damn. Hibiscus, you make gooood ice cream. (And you have adorable ambiance + service - a huge plus).

I had the coconut raspberry ice cream (made with coconut milk) and the pistachio ice cream (made with mung bean) - $4 for 2 scoops ($3/1 & $5/3). I have frequented just about every frozen yogurt place in downtown Toronto, and I've been to quite a few ice cream parlours; I have even been to the likes of Dolce Gelato and Xenocava. But nowhere, whether store-bought or shop-made, has any frozen dessert ever blown my mind the way Hibiscus's has. And with zero dairy at that. 

Lucky vegans. If this is what your food tastes like, I may have to join you."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try this spot out for a minute. We got there and it wasn't many people there but took forever to get drinks. Hence only 3 stars the service was subpar, I understand the aspect of group serving but they fell short several times. Our appetizers were brought to us and we still us no utensils on the table. When the server finally came back to our table she said she didn't notice. The food was good I ordered the kalbi and the kids opted for sushi. The food was the highlight of the experience for us."}
{"text":"It's a small restaurant. It looks nice inside, and my only critique is that the lighting could be better (brighter). I went around lunch time on a week day, and business was sort of slow. I ordered Grandma's Bibimbap, and it was good. It seems like it would be a nice (lunch or dinner) date spot."}
{"text":"this place is fabulous. totally small town family run business. all organic, vegan and gluten free. Their menu is small. 

Food
soup and salad- 5/5
coconut vanilla homemade ice cream - 6/5 out of this world
pistachio homemade ice cream- 4/5"}
{"text":"The food is always delicious. Try some sushi or bimbap. The service is excellent and they have a good selection of wine and cocktails too. Not to mention they have a daily drink special!"}
{"text":"The place is amazing. Everything is so flavorful and fresh. For those who ignores vegetarian food because of meat-bias, you are missing out. 

The soups are very flavorful and they always make me inspire to deconstruct and recreate. The crepes are very well done. I would highly recommend this place for lunch. Also, the interior is very charming."}
{"text":"Pros:
* Salad + Soup combo is good

Cons:
* Closes early (6pm I think?)
* There's often a line, and they don't take reservations
* Service is SLOW
* Crepes were kinda gross

Compared to competition:
* Fresh: Hibiscus is cheaper than Fresh, but their salad has less greens, less options
* Kupfert & Kim: The food at hibiscus has a lighter taste (which I like), it's not as heavily seasoned as K&K which can sometimes be overwhelming and quite caloric
* will update with more

Conclusion: If you're vegetarian or vegan, you'll love this place

Update: they got rid of the mullberries and replaced with dried cranberry raisins :/ Booo!"}
{"text":"In my opinion, the food was delicious. It was simple and healthy. As for the service, it is a bit slow and no one greeted me as I entered. But overall, it was still a good experience."}
{"text":"We LOVE Thai food and try every restaurant we can find.  The food here is fabulous, the young man who served us could not have been nicer or more accomdating to our special requests and the quality was first rate.  Thank you for a great first visit.  We will be back."}
{"text":"Hidden gem!

If you like veggies and are vegan/veg, definitely get the soup/salad combo. 

If you are not so prone to the vegetable-life, the creeps are the way to go. 

This time I got the salad/soup. The soup was ginger squash and it was OK (I thought it had a little too much ginger taste). 

The salad was yummy! I liked that there were a lot of different things. But I think that if you aren't into healthy eating, you might not enjoy the salad as much as I did. 

Atmosphere is great. LOVED that I could see the chefs cooking from my seat. You can truly tell that you are eating real food made with love.

The price for the soup/salad combo is pretty great! We were full by the end of it."}
{"text":"Hibiscus hits a spot that many little (or not so little) veg places around Toronto can't - a simple offering of healthy salads and soups, but also a great range of decadent crepes, dairy-free ice cream and baked treats (cookies, slices & the like). 

I had the salad bowl and daily soup combo, with a raw cracker. What a winner: filling, fresh and flavoursome for a good price (just under $9) - and a great variety in the salad bowl, more than i've seen anywhere else (greens, grains, tofu and veg - the lot!). This combo is more than enough to fuel your weekend wander around Kensington Market. I capped this off with a generous scoop of 'chocolate brownie' ice cream in a small wafer cup ($3) which I wish had just gone on forever and ever. There's a fantastic range of flavours like i've never seen on offer anywhere else with vegan ice cream - definitely on my list to try are the green tea and black sesame.

There's an impressive selection of crepes on offer (although the crepes are vegan, there seem to be quite a lot of cheese fillings on the savoury side of things) - I think the crepes would be something i'd make a deliberate stop for rather than something to have after the salad/soup combo. 

The only downsides are the limited seating and the limited opening hours. But you can bet i'm going to make this a regular weekend stop!"}
{"text":"Delicious, delicious, delicious! Very friendly service too!! It was hard to find though. Some of the businesses are not numbered. We had to stop and ask 3 other businesses what their address was to find it and it is set inward making the sign difficult to see from the street. It still gets 5 stars for the food and service :)"}
{"text":"The neighborhood is as fascinating as it can get; in the heart of Little Portugal/Kensington Market. The squash ginger soup was outstanding and the salad was innovative and good--lots of textures and unusual ingredients. It would be great to have a non-tofu option but it's not really customizable. The service was competent but not overly welcoming compared to the friendliness of other places in Toronto. I would certainly go here again because it was evident the owners and staff believe in what they're doing and are committed to providing high quality, interesting options. The atmosphere was homey but sophisticated--nothing pretentious here."}
{"text":"After a tennis match at Myers Park HS I was so excited to find a place with Korean and Thai food. My son loves Thai and I love Korean food so thought this would be the perfect place for us. The interior decor is nice and the staff equally so, but the food just did not pass muster for us. 

My son got the fried rice which came with shrimp and chicken, a nice touch. But he said the taste was bland. I got the tom kha soup and bibimbap. The soup was OK, but too salty for my taste (and I like salty). The salt muted the brightness you expect from Thai soups. The bibimbap lacked flavor. The meat was ground rather than sliced, and it didn't have that delicious Korean bbq flavor you hope for in this style of cuisine. I had to keep putting gojuchang sauce on it to add flavor, but then soon enough it was just like eating rice and sauce.

Service was good. Water kept filled. And I was offered a refill of my kimchee and pickled daikon sides, which was good because they were the best tasting part of the whole meal.

This reminded me to avoid places that serve \"this AND that\" cuisine, especially if sushi also creeps in the on menu as it does here."}
{"text":"Better than I expected! We went at closing time and the guy was chill enough to let us dine in as long as we just get a salad. 
Salad was one of the best salads Ive ever had- and so filling!!!  im a little guilty about that because I usually never finish my meals.

And I think the cook was so generous! he gave us complimentary peanut bar as dessert. My friend had the coconut ice cream- a good touch. Overall place is great! Definitely will be going back!!!"}
{"text":"It's just the type of crepe that you wanna have. Everything tastes fresh and in proportion. It's a bit pricey and I wasn't much fond of the brownies. Overall, very good!"}
{"text":"Omg. The salad. So tasty. We ordered our food to-go. The woman at the door had a sour attitude but no worries the food was good and perhaps she was having a bad day.  At first I was disappointed in the size but it was so filling that when I was finished I honestly didn't care."}
{"text":"We had a large order - which included: spring rolls (tasty but nothing special, cabbage of some sort and a bit of carrot was all inside), crispy chicken (breading was good, chicken a little dry), green curry (tasted pretty authentic but the addition of shrimp for $3 included a total of 2 shrimp), fried rice with chicken (had 3 small chunks of chicken), and ginger beef (decent but pretty bland). From reading other reviews I really expected the food to be better quality. It wasn't horrible, but I don't plan on returning...that's $70+ I should have used elsewhere. Meh."}
{"text":"We had been to this restaurant before and saw a Groupon for it so we took advantage of it. The waitress is so nice and helpful. She really knows the menu and will give you an honest answer not just the menu item that is more expensive. They were out of the Ass Clown Hibiscus, so I will be looking forward to trying it the next time we go. We both got the pad thai. My wife said it was the best she has ever had. They can even make it spicy for you which is not common so she tells me. I thought it was a little sweet but the next time I will just order it spicier. It was big enough to have left over that my wife ate for lunch the next day (at 10:30 cause she couldn't wait any longer.)"}
{"text":"I tried out this place once and went back with my cousin. I'd have to say I'd be willing to go vegan once a week just go here and I eat anything. 
My cousin liked it so much she said she'd go alone to eat there. The food was so filling and the place is small and cozy and pleasant. I'd go back."}
{"text":"Wonderful place for Veggie Lovers! 
Everything was so perfect for us. I read all good reviews then asked my husband to check it out with me ^^ We weren't disappointed at all! Kensington is a place for hanging out with friends (even your lovers) There's many choices for you to eat and shopping. Hibiscus is another good choice for people who loves healthy food..all vegan is welcome :)
It's a small restaurant..very small. When we got in there, it was packed but we waited for it. There's not variety but you can trust me that you would love that COMBO! Salad and Soup of (the time) I saw 3 kinds of soup when we were there :D Sounds great!? Besides, the staffs r nice.
We definitely would come back again..worth it!!!!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the food here. It was my first time trying this kind of food and I loved it! I tried the savory crepe with basil, vegan cheese, tomato, avocado and it was delicious! My sister had the soup and salad combo. They were both delicious! And the prices are very reasonable!"}
{"text":"The food was delicious and well prepared. Service was prompt and friendly. Overall, we had a great experience. I'd definitely go here again."}
{"text":"Went in for lunch last weekend and had their salad bowl and their buckwheat crepe with walnuts, pears, chutney and vegan cheese. Both were wonderful dishes! I loved the nutty flavours of the buckwheat crepe, and how it created the perfect blanket for the crisp pears and the sweet, zingy (apricot?) chutney. It was a nice play between the sweet and savoury, which I loved.  The salad bowl was also a bright, light and delightful! Will definitely come back again!"}
{"text":"If you're into good soup and vegan salad with a wild variety of proteins, veg, and textures, bookmark this one. Yummy, good size portion, and great service/ decor/ music. Five stars!"}
{"text":"I'm not much of a vegan/vegetarian/gluten-free type fan, but on a mission to eat \"healthier\", I stopped by here on a Saturday afternoon.

Having eaten other vegan salad concoctions before, they generally taste like eating paper.  I was pleasantly surprised at the salad.  Maybe it was the dressing, but adding sweet ingredients like sweet potato, beets and cranberries made a world of a difference.  A had a fleeting thought that I could eat this every day.  I also tried two of their savoury crepes.  They were OK.  The gluten free crepe was a bit on the crumbly side and I in general found it too sweet (and they also have sweet crepes).  Mind you, it's hard to make a good savoury crepe with out meat or at least egg.  I did like the fact they added avocado slices to the top.

The service is a little shoddy, but this is a vegan place I'd actually return to.  I'm starting to surprise myself."}
{"text":"Excellent service from Joann, sushi chef and bar tender! Ordered green curry chicken and sushi burrito w salmon and seaweed. Asked for hot sauce and love hot oil. Wine recommended with 2 different tastings was a great experience. I highly recommend this secret spot!"}
{"text":"UberEATS ordered Pad Thai and Mango Sticky rice.   The Pad Thai was delish.   Not too sweet or dry.   It had fresh ground peanuts that added to its wonderful flavor and authenticity.   Minus one star for the insulting small size of the mango sticky rice.  Wish I took a picture... the small size piece of rice was saranwrap (1\" x 3\") for $6.  
Other than my dissatisfaction of the dessert... this place was good for an an UberEATS option."}
{"text":"I walked in for for the first time at lunch and opted to sit at the bar. Incredible deal on the lunch menu, the Buddha Bowl. Bowl A is your choice of generous portioned traditional Thai and Korean comfort dishes (pad Thai, bulgogi, etc) as well as two sides. Bowl B is the same concept but with sushi. I opted for Bowl A and it came with a spring roll and I chose edamame. 


In short, the food was fantastic. The service was friendly, attentive and personable. The decor/vibe has some personality; the bartender told me that they locally sourced as much furnishings as possible. I can't wait to come back and try something off of the cocktail menu."}
{"text":"I'm a whiskey drinker, and I was surprised by the selection Hibiscus has.  Rare whiskeys like Nikka and Crown Royal Rye is served here.  Cap it off with a Manhattan and the Bibimbap and it's a great night."}
{"text":"It took us awhile to find it since it was downstairs of the shopping center, but we did! This place is a hidden gem, and now my favorite restaurant. It's hard to balance between different types of Asian cuisine in one restaurant (especially Korean and Thai like whoa) but they pulled it off!!! We ordered a ton of things like the Bibimbap, the Sushiritto, Green Curry, Seafood Pancake, and for dessert the Purple Rice with Vanilla Ice Cream. I was not disappointed with a single dish. The service was amazing, the seasoning of the food was impeccable, the the theme and decor of the place is so cute. The Curry was the perfect spice, the seafood pancake was crispy, the Bibimbap actually had flavor, and the sushiritto is the best I have had so far! I will be back FOR SURE"}
{"text":"The soup & salad combo never disappoints but the vegan crêpes are a little too expensive for how un-filling they are. Maybe if they came with a little garden salad or more toppings, I would part with my $15 more easily. I swear I'm hungrier after having one!! 
The atmosphere is lively but cozy and the ingredients are high quality, so there's that. Their home-made vegan ice creams are a nice treat, too."}
{"text":"I've been to Hibiscus a couple of times and really enjoyed each meal.
First of all, if you don't already know, this is a vegetarian, gluten free establishment, but the tasty food more than makes up for the absence of meat and flour in their menu.
I've had several of the crepes: all very good, and sufficient portion size to satisfy most normal people. But I think the best dish I have enjoyed here is the house salad - a fabulous combination of flavours and textures that surprises and pleases with every bite.
Service can be inconsistent, and this is Kensington Market, so parking is tricky, but I really think you will enjoy this place, especially if you require strict dietary conditions."}
{"text":"I read that this restaurant had really great reviews so I tried it out for the first time this week!

First of all, Hibiscus is located at one of the most eclectic and unique neighborhoods. The general atmosphere was really quaint and cozy and I felt instantly welcome the moment I stepped in. The restaurant is decorated to look almost like a park and is very comforting.

I've never had vegan or vegetarian food at a restaurant before, so this was an interesting experience. I ordered the Soup of the Day (Butternut Squash and Potato), which I thought was very reasonably priced at ~$5 for a large. I thought that the soup was alright (really sweet in that natural vegetable kind of way) but it was almost a little plain (but that may be because I've been spoiled by my mother's awesome home cooking :P). The cracker was something I've never tried before, gluten-free and made from dehydrating apples, zucchini and some type of seed (as one of the servers nicely explained, he was so patient and knowledgeable!)

Service was prompt and friendly, they were never too pushy into getting me to try a specific item or anything!

What I really regret is not trying their salad bowls (I only noticed how amazing they looked after I was halfway into my soup! D:). They have an awesome selection of things to pick from and everything looks delicious! I'm gonna bring a friend so I can try the buckwheat crepes as well :P

I would have also liked to try one of their desserts, but the portion of soup they gave me was really hearty and I was honestly stuffed by the time I finished.

Four stars for the excellent service and atmosphere - I can't wait to come back! :D"}
{"text":"Overall is good. Ordered Thai dishes which had some Thai feeling, but way too salty.
I didn't expect this to be authentic so I didn't disappointed about this. But whatever food this was, it's too salty.

Crispy Chicken is my favorite from here."}
{"text":"Time for the annoying cliche Yelp review starter sentence...\"I WANTED TO LOVE THIS PLACE BUT...\" I kinda did! Here's the deal.

The food was good but not mindblowingly delicious.  In fact, I agree with a lot of the reviewers that the crepe I had was not particularly flavourful.  It was a nice lunch and they also have a good selection of teas that all can be made iced.  That was exciting!

The restaurant itself is really light and airy on the inside but that is destroyed by how sardine-like the seating situation is.  It is really tight. And like others have said, the service took an eternity. It took forever to get our food, forever to get our water, forever to get our bill.  I felt aged upon exit.  I'm happy I tried it out but am unsure if I will return because of the service and seating."}
{"text":"Amazing.

Small salad always fills me up just right. The crepes are fantastic. The price is as wonderful as the food."}
{"text":"Went there for lunch. It was a solid meal. But I feel like there was a lack of flavor or sauce. Could have just been the lunch version. I would try it again."}
{"text":"can't review the food as we didn't end up ordering anything... but I don't think you should even go here if you're expecting to be hungry... 

the menu is super tiny (one page) and there is so much variety as one page can fir. a soup of the day, few savory and few sweet crepes... nothing that actually sounds fascinating for a hungry stomach.  

prices are on an expensive end and the place is super tiny and crowded.

maybe I'll give it another try some other day"}
{"text":"My boyfriend is lactose intolerant so we try to eat at a lot of vegan places, just so it's worth it. I ordered the soup and salad, the soup of the day was potato leek. The salad was delicious, it had so many yummy goodies (kale, broccoli, rice noodles, sweet potato purée, quinoa, tofu, among others). Delicious and simple. The soup was pretty good, creamy and thick for a vegan non tomato base. My boyfriend ordered the vegan cheddar cheese crepe that had tomato, mushroom and avocado. It was delicious and the cheese was so good as well. To end we each got two scoops of vegan ice cream. I got the chai and chocolate brownie and Jake got the chocolate almond and brownie as well. It was the best non-dairy desert I've ever had. This place is a must for healthy/vegan/vegetarian eaters, great food at a reasonable price. Beautiful interior as well and nice people, would recommend to anyone!"}
{"text":"Very good vegan options and very friendly/helpful staff. Not a huge menu, but definitely enough options to choose from. I would definitely come back if I was in the area again. One note, it's not a huge place so you may have to wait for a table."}
{"text":"This restaurant has the best salad in the entire city.  There are so many ingredients and it's such a unique mixture of ingredients.  The presentation is very nicely done as well.  This quaint restaurant/café has a calm ambience, staff are friendly, and it's a great place if you want something quick and healthy."}
{"text":"Even though it is just \"soup and salad\", this is one of the healthiest meals one can have, next to something from your own kitchen. It's no frills, but done well and a true value when you're downtown and in need of something light and healthy. 

Above all, I enjoyed the ambiance of the place. It's small, but not cramped, there were plants, lots of sunlight and some jazz playing in the background. l'm smitten."}
{"text":"Okay folks, give these people some love. The food here is amazing. Its got a nice urban casual atmosphere. The funky lamps set the mood. The food wonderful and custom ordered. I had the crispy hibiscus sushi with tuna. Worth it! I got the fried spring rolls and Pad See Yew with chicken.  You can taste the freshness in the ingredients. They let you choose your spicy level. Well worth it. The staff is knowlegable and freindly. Ill be back again"}
{"text":"Pretty chill place. We had to wait a bit before being seated and there isn't much space for that. The staff is very welcoming and friendly. I had the soup and salad. Believe me, you will be full after this order. It had a nice sweet taste and I loved how colourful it is! I also shared the brownie which had a similar texture to a chocolate cake, super yummy. And I shared the apple cinnamon crepe which I highly recommend."}
{"text":"Delicious quality food at very reasonable prices in a cozy cafe... Perfect. 

My lunch date and I arrived on a Friday afternoon around 1:30pm. We were lucky to be seated promptly because it was quite busy (small seating capacity is part of the charm of this place). 

I ordered a matcha latte with almond milk which was excellent and perfectly sweetened. We both ordered vegan buckwheat crepes and shared a salad because we were intrigued. Just WOW. Everything was delicious, bursting with flavour and freshness. Our server manage to be very prompt with our orders, drinks and checking in while we ate. 

All in all, I can't wait to go back! Amazing food and atmosphere."}
{"text":"Got the soup and salad combo after reading all the reviews. I was definitely impressed. The soup was ginger squash and it was really tasty - flavourwise though, not too unique, as I've made this at home before. But the salad...it blew me away. Awesome flavour combinations. I make salads and vegan meals at home with similar ingredients, but somehow have never managed to make it taste like the salad here. Yum!!"}
{"text":"I took a day trip to Toronto from Buffalo by bus. The terminal was not very far from Kensington Market so I walked around there for a few hours. This might have been a weekend because there were vendors in the street, although I could be wrong. 

I saw this quaint cafe hidden by a big tree from the road. It didn't look anything special from the outside, it just looked small and cozy to me. I went inside and saw a few tables, and only a couple left unoccupied. I ordered a crepe and tea. I do not remember exactly what kind I ordered (this was in 2007) but I remember being so comfortable there that I stayed for more than an hour. I was by the window watching the world outside. 

I pulled out my journal and started to write. The vibe inside was very nice, very relaxing. The music wasn't as loud as my thoughts, and everyone seemed to respect the faintness. 

I visited Toronto for a day, walked around Kensington Market, and had lunch here. No CN Tower, no tourist places. Just this neighborhood alone, was enough to make me want to go back and visit Toronto again."}
{"text":"The younger generation of Thai Taste shown in Hibiscus. They had same comfort dishes like curry, pad tai and their fried rice. But they also offer sushi and mixed drinks. I ordered my usual which is the yellow curry with coconut milk, onions and potatoes served over white rice. And of course that's what I been craving so I'm happy.. 
The hostess turns out to be our waiter and she's great. Alway on point and check on us often! If I'm in that area.. I'll definitely stop by!"}
{"text":"You know how you look through all the Yelp pictures and read the reviews from fellow Yelpers bragging on the same dishes. Then you go ahead and order those same dishes thinking, \"Oh yea, this is going to be IT!\" Come to find out it wasn't all THAT great. 

BUT! I'm going to give this place another chance (food wise). I ain't knocking it, but based on some of the dishes I had I'm not yet a fan. I hate to be that one going in a completely different direction than other Yelpers on the food, but maybe I just need to try other dishes (sushi perhaps)?

My curry was pretty good. The flavor was the usual coconuty green curry with chicken and veggies and fluffy rice. I didn't like the huge pieces of eggplant that were a bit tough to eat. 

My Moscow Mule was good... kind of hard to mess that up. 

I didn't get to try my dude's dish but he said it tasted burnt and he didn't really enjoy it. I had a lot of curry left so he polished off my dish in 2.5 seconds. 

I did enjoy the appetizers. I wouldn't suggest ordering the dumplings. Although tasty, you only get 4 small pieces for the price. The lettuce wrap was really good. I'd order that again. 

Service was good and I was afraid based on the popularity of the place, reservations were needed, but there were plenty of tables available on the Friday night we went. 

I'll reserve my true waiting for this place after we go again."}
{"text":"Last night's dinner here was a great experience! The server was very attentive and helpful. The ambiance is trendy and intimate, definitely good for a date night. Now about the food that made a few say, \"let's come back on Saturday\" because it was so good.  Everything smelled delicious and tasted just as good as it smelled. Due to my current food challenge I was limited on what I could have but that Steak salad with the lime dressing was EVERYTHANG!!! This Thai fusion place is definitely a place you want to add to your list!"}
{"text":"Smaller beer list but a few good local choices.

Fried dumpling appetizer. Interesting... It was deep fried instead of pan fried. Good but a little dry.

I got bibimbap. First time I ever had it and it was pretty tasty. No frame of reference but I enjoyed it.

Wife got pad ke mow aka drunken noodles which we both enjoyed.

Overall very good and we'll probably be back"}
{"text":"I found about this restaurant with the help of Yelp. I was a bit hesitant going with my boyfriend as we had previously went to a vegetarian/vegan restaurant and he wasn't impressed. I ordered the soup (sweet potato and coconut) and salad combo and he ordered the vegan cheddar, chutney, pecans and pear crepe. I had such high expectations of the salad because of all the reviews that when I actually had it, it fell flat. However, I loved how the salad had so many components (sweet potato, quinoa, lentils). The crepe on the other hand was delicious! My boyfriend loved it! I liked how the pears were kept raw and we were impressed with the vegan cheddar. 

The staff was friendly but service was slow. I think if I was to come here again I would order a crepe."}
{"text":"I've severely cut down my meat intake for the past few weeks and it's going a lot better than I expected. A part of that \"going great\" feeling is obviously attributed to the fact I've been spending a lot of time in the Kensington Market area and Hibiscus has played a big role on my lunch diet. 
I was meaning to try a crepe before writing my review, but with some time to kill now I decided to jump for it anyway. The soup and salad combo is such an amazing deal, it's not crazy cheap but for the money you get such a filling meal. I had it for work one day and it lasted all the way till the evening and I mean in terms of actually still eating it at 5pm just because I found it hard to finish it all in one go, and it makes for a great spoonful snack while working. 

I love Denise's comparison to it being like a bibimbap dish because that's what it reminded me of as well. Great ingrediants and very helpful staff. 

I admit I was a little loss when I first walked in as I didn't know where the line up started/ended or if I should order first or pay or even what my options were as the menu cards were hidden from my sight. 
It's a tiny place so don't come looking for a sit down meal as there won't likely be any space.

I know this review was basically me going on about how good their salad and soup is, but I tell you, it's worth it!"}
{"text":"Oh my goodness.  How someone couldn't give 5/5 stars to this restaurant is beyond me. Affordable, vegan / vegetarian , high end food and comfortable ambience with incredible service. I am just utterly blown away.  This was everything I need today, come here, now."}
{"text":"I haven't had a chance to try the crepes*, but the soup and salad special is filling, delicious and easy on the wallet! Best of all, it's the kind of meal that will leave you feeling really healthy afterwards. I can't be sure, but I suspect eating the salad deal may be equivalent to half an hour's worth of exercise. 

The atmosphere is cozy and relaxing, like Helen noted, it looks more like a tea shop than a restaurant. The selfish side of me is worried that this place will get too popular, since seating is definitely at a premium. But nevertheless, you will definitely win brownie points with your veggie friends if you introduce them to Hibiscus.

*To be honest, I'm not sure I'll ever get a chance to try the crepes, the salad combo is just too good!"}
{"text":"Had a fabulous dinner at Hibiscus while being in town for work. I had the Tom yum goong soup as a starter and the Pad met ma maung as a main and both where delicious. The best Thai food I've had in a while!!! The restaurant staff was very friendly and attentive and was spot on with their recommendations. I will definitely come back next time I'm in Charlotte."}
{"text":"Came here on a Sunday for lunch with a group of people and most of us were very disappointed. Food and sushi rolls are overpriced. We had a waiter who seemed to have a very bad attitude. We had to wait very long for the food to come and I ended up receiving the wrong sushi roll. Our waiter didn't even apologize and just walked away. A different waiter was kind enough to take that roll off my check. Overall very poor experience, will not be coming back."}
{"text":"One of my favorite lunch spots. I get the soup and salad every time but the crepes are great too. The people that work there are laid-back and pleasant. The place is nicely decorated with interesting books and paintings."}
{"text":"3 words: Get. The. Salad. 
I can't wait to go back to eat more of it. I visited for lunch after an epic SoulCycle sesh with 2 girlfriends and 2 of us got the soup/salad combo and one got a crepe. The crepe was good, the fillings were really fresh and they gave a generous amount of them, however, I was obsessed with my butternut squash soup and 40-ingredient salad. It is a pretty small space for dining in, so dining out is likely easiest, but the staff were super nice and answered all of our questions with a smile nonetheless :)."}
{"text":"Brunch on a rainy Sunday afternoon with friends. We were able to get a seat in the small place at 12 but after 1pm it got super busy. 

They have a hearty soup and salad combo. Today it was leek and potato soup: thick,  pureed and served with a crunchy something that was really good. 

The crepes were really good but hit and miss depending on the flavour. The tomato, goat cheese pesto was amazing but my banana walnut maple syrup was a little dry. 

We didn't get a chance to try the home made ice cream but will be back for sure. 

The coffee was meh and a little watery.  I would say this is a lunch rather than a breakfast place.

We'll be back, but come early to get a seat!"}
{"text":"I can't believe I've never reviewed Hibiscus... this is my favourite lunch spot! 

If I need to say why - good owners, great food, amazing ice cream (if you like chocolate try the brownie non-dairy ice cream). They have very well thought flavour combinations in all dishes and no-frills, which means you don't pay extra for the frillies. Just an honest family business with healthy eats. 

Everything is good here! Bring a take-away container cause the salad is surprisingly filling!"}
{"text":"I love the Kensington market. Every time I'm in Toronto, I'd make sure to stop by here to either try a new food spot or go to my usual favorites. As a vegetarian, I was excited to try Hibiscus since my sister recommended it to me. 

Good: It's a hip little spot, clean looking place and inexpensive. My sister ordered the savory 'vegan cheddar chutney pecan pears' crepes and it was pretty good! I just wish I ordered it too. I had a not so great experience with our first waitress, and better service by the second one. 

Bad: I decided to get the soup and salad combo since it was only $15. Firstly, the menu doesn't have a description for the salad in the 'soup and salad' section of the menu, so I asked our waitress if the salad in my combo is the 42 ingredients salad. A simple yes or no question. She condescendingly replies \"it's a salad\", so I repeated my question to clarify if it's the same one, to which she rudely replies \"well, we only have one type of salad here\". At this point, I've lost my patience, I don't make a fuss unless I feel I've been instigated. \"So it's the 42 ingredient salad? That's what I am asking.\" She finally replies 'yes' and then I asked her to give us a few minutes to decide. At this point, I'm so heated over this condescending attitude. I told my sister we're leaving (I cannot stand bad service at restaurants) but she doesn't want to, so we ended up disputing a bit loudly. I got really riled up but my sister calms me down and we ended up staying. The wait staff must've overheard because we immediately got a new waitress, to which our brunch date ended a lot more smoothly. Now, the food. Was that salad as mind blowing as everyone described it to be? I certainly would disagree. It tastes like 42 minimally flavored chopped vegetables separated in one bowl. It tasted exactly what you envisioned to be 'healthy': a tolerable, guilt free meal that isn't your first choice . I almost forgot I've ordered a soup and it just so happened to be a cauliflower soup. Another disappointing minimally flavored  soup in a cup. 

Bottom line: The service did improve at the end, so it wasn't a completely awful experience for me. I'm surprised at how high their reviews are, given how mediocre my meal was. I really wanted to like this place, especially since it's a vegetarian spot, but I find the food (especially that damn salad) to be a bit over hyped and lacking. However, I would give their savory crepes a solid two thumbs up. Would I be back? Very unlikely."}
{"text":"One of my favourite places to grab a vegan/gluten-free brownie or a fruit smoothie.

The menu isn't huge, your choices consist of soup, salad or a crepe. All meals and combos are under $10 so it's very affordable. The staff are almost entirely Japanese and very friendly. They're also super attentive and great at refilling your water. The food is fresh and the owner can often be seen leaving the cafe to go buy produce.

My one complaint would be the furniture. It's almost entirely cheap Ikea patio furniture and park benches. My friend and I shared a bench and our table was a skinny console table. The bench was wobbly under the weight of the two of us but the console table, which faced out towards the street was actually kind of cool. Like being a floating bar without a wall or window directly on the other side.

I would suggest they move the patio furniture outside, where there's a dirth of seating and find some indoor, non-wobbly, non-swedish furniture for the cafe."}
{"text":"This is my new go to comfort spot! Bc it's is such a great fusion Japanese-Thai-Lao flavor dishes with an upscale edge making the dining experience feel more upscale compared to other asian restaurants that offer decent Thai and Lao flavors. Their Laos sausage combo with sticky rice and the spicy dipping sauce is simply just ADDICTING TO EAT! And when it's cold out I always use post mates or eats24 app to get their soups to stay warm indoors, I can't spell the name so I'm not gonna attempt to sound stupid but the soup is made fresh and noodles a hand made hand cut fresh noodles, you don't get FRESH HAND CUT NOODLE soup hardly anywhere  around Charlotte .... actually at the top of my head I can't think of a place that does, even noodle house don't do that. Men let me tell you something. If u ever get into that argument with your lady and can't decide where to eat? We ALL HAVE BEEN THERE there are so many you tube videos of this never ending argument! hibiscus is the answer to your problem, this asian fusion restaurant gives her the choices of her indecisiveness  trust me, she will find something she likes sushi, Thai, soups, great appetizers, great curry , and if she don't? Which I'm sure she will, Grab a custom drink at their bar. I do, just to drown out the noise of the old lady."}
{"text":"Recently discovered this Thai/Asia Fusion restaurant. Upon walking in, I immediately fell in love with the decor and the setup of the dining and bar areas. I ordered food to go and had a wonderful conversation with several of the employees about the food, the craft cocktail list and the location while we waited.  We took the food home and it was delicious! Definitely our new go to Thai place in Charlotte!"}
{"text":"Have been twice and will be back. Had the Bibimbab the first time and it was great. Waiter said to order it in the hot bowl to make the rice crispy as it is a better taste. I agreed, but not sure why they charge an extra dollar to serve it in a way they believe is better??  But it was great. 

Dumplings are very good, nice thin skin and not too chewy.

Pad Thai also good, not going to blow your hair back but is one of the better preparations in the Queen City.

Love that they have Wooden Robot beer on tap. Good Morning Vietnam is awesome and the rest of the taps are good as well.

Prices are fair given the neighborhood. Wonder how they are going to do when the Korean fried chicken joint opens next door."}
{"text":"I had a lovely lunch here today.  The atmosphere is excellent and the place is well designed.  We began our meal with some fried dumplings which were quite tasty.  I ordered the bibimbap (which is why I came there) and it was outstanding.  I have not had it so good since i moved out here from California.  My roommate ordered the crispy duck salad and loved it!  The chef introduced himself and our waitress was excellent.  I will happily return to this establishment.  You can park in the Total wines parking lot and walk down the steps to get there."}
{"text":"This was such a nice small place to go to. It is absolutely amazing for meeting up with someone for lunch. 
The service was beyond excellent. We wanted to sit outside and as soon as they found out that it was going to rain, they let us know and gave us a table inside. 
I only managed to try their soup of the day which was a butternut squash soup. It was a very hardy meal for just the soup but honestly, it was worth. 
I want to come back, and perhaps next time try one of their savoury crepes."}
{"text":"Terrible service and understaffed! Waited with two other couples who said they had been there 10 minutes just for a host (bartender) to approach us.  Finally Got seated after the sushi chef cleaned our table and waited 10 more minutes and no one said a word to us before we decided to walk out.  Would have loved to try the food but seeing many other dissatisfied customers we decided to go elsewhere."}
{"text":"The BEST salad ever. When you think salad - normally lettuce and tomatoes come to mind - but they are missing acts in Hisbicus' discreetly named \"salad\" and I am very thankful for this. This ain't no ordinary salad people. It is a delicious combination of beets, sweet potato, quinoa, sunflower seeds, green beans, and i am sure sesame seed oil all tossed with veggy love....just fabulous...oh and affordable!"}
{"text":"I really can not believe the high reviews 
First, this place is not good for kids
When my daughter ordered a sweet crepe with banana, she was not able to eat it as it was extremely bitter.
When she asked to replace the order with she merging else, they refused!!!
Very bad approach in my opinion 

Everything we ordered was just not good"}
{"text":"Went on a Friday night around 8:30pm. They didn't seem busy but had to wait a long time for drinks and food. Outside seating is nice but away from restaurant so it felt like we were part of another one that's there. Food was good and so were drinks."}
{"text":"I think Kensington Market is pretty much the only vegetarian friendly spot in Toronto.  You'll find at least four restaurants and organic grocery in this small neighborhood block.  Hibiscus is one of the vegan and vegetarian cheap eat spot.  They've got homemade vegan ice cream (yum... chocolate almond!)  served up with vegan crepe and fruits.  That's pretty amazing.  They also have tea and sandwiches.  All can be made vegan if you aren't a vegetarian.  I got a sandwich, crepe, and fruit smoothie, all came out to be under $30.  That's an amazing deal compare to most places in Toronto.  Though it is not a restaurant, it is more of a cafe.  The salad I hear from the next table is also amazing.  This girl she keeps picking off of her friend's bowl... even though she said she already ate dinner."}
{"text":"42-ingredient salad was excellent. Not a vegan, but could be if that was always at the ready! The ginger squash soup was good, as was the kombucha. Small place with mostly tables for two. Service was prompt and nice. I like that they leave water on the table."}
{"text":"Hibiscus is my favorite vegetarian spot in town. They do have somewhat of a limited menu but I don't care, because their signature salad is what I come here for anyway. It's the best!

I've been here many times over the last 3 years, bringing many carnivore friends. 9/10 liked hibiscus and were pleasantly surprised by how flavorful a vegetarian meal can be. I also enjoy coming here on my own, taking in the vibrancy of Kensington market and on warmer days, sitting out on the patio and enjoying a book as I eat my meal."}
{"text":"Small place with a little front patio during the summer. Beautiful, fresh food right in Kensington Market. Most of the menu is vegan, and the desserts are delicious."}
{"text":"Called ahead to make reservations and we're assured that we didn't need them. Arrived 15 minutes later and they didn't have one table free. Said that we would have to wait at least 15 minutes. Noticed that one table had been waiting 10 minutes so they got up to get menus themselves. Walked out at that point."}
{"text":"Great service! Love the atmosphere! Great environment! The food is delicious! The hibiscus burrito is amazing! Sushi burrito is large and reasonably priced. The Hawaii poke is a yummy appetizer. House made side dishes when you order Korean food. The bimbimbop is delicious as well! So glad we found this awesome Asian fusion place!"}
{"text":"This is new restaurant, very nice decorations, located in fun and beautiful area. Staffs are yong and excellent, they made great food, sushi and Asian food! Their mix drinks are so good! Good temperature here. We love it"}
{"text":"Cute hipster vegan/vegetarian cafe. They use fresh, organic ingredients. I felt so clean and healthy eating here! Usually I don't enjoy these types of places, but I honestly didn't miss the meat.

Crepes are really solid along with the salad. Simple, tasty dishes. Give it a try!"}
{"text":"I would like to preface my review with the fact that the food was excellent at Hibiscus.  However, the service was far from that at tonight's visit.  We aren't sure if they were training new staff or if it was so close to opening that they were off their game.  But the waitstaff seemed rushed and uninformed about items from the bar.  Over all we are giving Hibiscus 3 stars and we'll attempt another visit, but will be less kind on the next review if things aren't improved."}
{"text":"Hibiscus is the hidden gem of vegetarian/vegan restaurants in Toronto. I recommend you get the 'combo', which comes with a soup and a bowl. The bowl is a beautifully balanced meal of both cooked and raw ingredients. It's macrobiotic in style, but the taste is much better -- and I don't know that I've seen the word 'macrobiotic' mentioned anywhere on their menu. In fact, there's no slogan, proselytizing, etc associated with this place: just wonderful, joyful food."}
{"text":"Tried this for the first time today and just WOW. 

Such a cute interior, really small and local - but that's pretty much all of Kensington places. 
Staff was super friendly and even though they were busy when we came, it was only a 5 minute wait!

I settled for the mozzarella/spinach/mushroom buckwheat crepe. At first I was nervous because I've never had a buckwheat crepe but DAMN. So so good! I'm a very light  eater who rarely finishes her plate but I ANNIHILATED it! 

Finished off with their incredible vegan ice cream - I had the almond chocolate. Ugh so good.

If you have a friend who thinks vegan/veggie food can't be good please take them here!

Going to be my new fav veggie place :)"}
{"text":"Great meal! Service was excellent and fast. The decor was lovely but my fiancé found the place a bit cramped when it started getting busy. We had the sushi burrito and Bangkok curry noodles, both of which were delicious. The prices were reasonable but be aware that the portions aren't huge as they are at many Thai restaurants. The portions were appropriate and filling but not two full meals like many places. We will be back to try more, especially lunch specials!"}
{"text":"I was super excited to try this place as it serves thai and korean food. How great is that?! My friend and I stopped by around 1 and it was emptied, so we received good service. The decorations are nice and has a romantic feel. 

We ordered lettuce wrap and chicken skewers as appetizer. The lettuce wrap was plain and could've been better. It wasn't bad, it just wasn't great. Was not worth $8 though. The chicken skewers only came in 2s and was $6, and although the sauces were good, the chicken tasted like rubber. 

For entrees, we had Bangkok Curry Noodle and Lao Sausages with sticky rice. BCN, which I am very familiar with and I was surprised this place served it, was not as great as I hoped it was. There was way too much coconut in the soup, I didn't like the carrots, and the portions were uneven, my friend had less soup than I did. The noodles were cut too small. As for the Loa sausages, I don't want to be rude, but it looks like store bought sausages that you can get at the asian store. Even with the rice, the portion is so small, how can they charge $12? After-all, thai and korean food are always more high-priced."}
{"text":"Hibiscus has the potential to be awesome but has to rework a few things.

Weary hostess approached me after I entered and told me that she couldn't seat me until she cleaned up some tables. After I was seated (about 10 minutes later), I saw several more empty tables had dirty plates, cups, etc. on them for at least 30 minutes. I had to wait about 15 minutes to order from the server who was helping both patrons inside and outside the restaurant and was spread too thin. Everyone I met seemed really nice, knowledgable, and customer-service oriented -- just seemed like they had too much work and not enough people on duty.

Food was good overall but inconsistent. Had some delicious soup (that was a surprisingly large portion) and the fresh spring rolls, and they were both things I would order again. The red curry dish was less successful and lacked flavor. 

My server was very good -- just seemed like he had too many tables. But he did his best to take good care of me. 

The restaurant decor is very tasteful and relaxing with a plum/purple color scheme."}
{"text":"Happened to pass by here in Kensington and spontaneously decided to drop by because I read good things about the place (and because we wanted crepes).

Cute place, very attentive and friendly staff. I got the savoury crepe ($15) : vegan cheddar, chutney, pecan and pear garnished with small slices of avocado and cooked zucchini (no greens, like the menu said).

The crepe was filling even though there wasn't a lot in it. The pears were cut thinly and the crepe was thin too. Nice amount of pecans though I wished that they were toasted.

The combo of cheese and chutney was interesting, though threw me off. It started with a gingerbread taste then it turned into curry.... maybe it's the cardamon?

The total came to $20 after tips. Damn, so expensive! No crepe is worth $20! There wasn't even a whole lot on the plate. I'm glad I tried this place out, but for the sake of my wallet, I'm not coming back."}
{"text":"When my boyfriend and I went, there wasn't a sushi chef in for work, so we couldn't order any sushi or any appetizers from the sushi bar. That was alright though, we ordered other stuff. The food is great. The chicken lettuce wraps is what got us the most!!! We shared it as an appetizer and it was literally us fighting for the last bite."}
{"text":"This place is open till 6 everyday, but closed on mondays. I walked by many times, only to find out its closed, so make sure you go early! 

Came here after my friends raved about how good the salad is, and it definitely lived up to the hype. I didn't think a vegan/gluten free salad can taste this good! It has 42 ingredients including quinoa, sweet potato, kale, help, okara, brocolli, tofu.. and the list goes on. It has a great balance of flavours and textures and I felt like I was eating a new ingredient with each bite. We shared a kiwi crepe for dessert. I did enjoy the buckwheat crepe, but wish the Kiwi would taste a bit sweeter.

Service here was good from what I remember, and the staff was very helpful in explaining the menu. The space is quite adorable, however the plastic table  felt a bit flimsy eating on and should be upgraded. 

Overall verdict: Would come here again for the salad, and perhaps opt for the savoury crepes instead of the sweet ones."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere and ambience. The savoury crepe I had was presented very nicely, and it tasted decent. However, it wasn't anything remarkable. For a little more than $16, the crepe was rather underwhelming and didn't really fill my tummy. I give it 3 stars because I tend to look for value for $ and probably wouldn't go here for food (mind you, the quality of ingredients was good). 

I'd come back for coffee or something but probably not for crepes at that price point. It's a good place for conversation."}
{"text":"Great food, great atmosphere, friendly staff.  I wish they had better hours, but that's really my only concern with them.  Keep it up!"}
{"text":"This place is the future of food.

This is how vegan food needs to be served. I had the lunch special ... a salad bowl with all sorts of goodies; quinoa, broccoli, lentils, cranberries, kale, tofu, etc. It came with a mug of butternut squash soup. It was perfect. All your fruit, veggies, and protein served in one healthy meal. No horribly fatty oils, no over the top soaked in salt veggies. Just pure goodness at an incredible value.

When a place has a limited menu, that's a sign of a good place. They focus on a limited number of things and perfecting them. No need to have pages of items. Just the best, none of the rest!"}
{"text":"We had lettuce wrap, Tom yum goong soup, bulgogi and basil Kai Dao chicken. The noodles and chicken in the lettuce wrap were good, but too finely cut. The soup was good. The basil Kai Dao chicken was good and authentic. However, the bulgogi was a disappointment. They mixed it with clear noodles which is another korean noodle dish called jap chae. And the side dishes that comes with korean food was all watered down. Overall, I give 3 stars. The lychee martini is good."}
{"text":"hibiscus is very good Asian  restaurant  if you are looking for a relaxing quiet environment employees give great customer service they check to see if all is fine regularly and the food taste and looks amazing and also serves a very good fried ice cream. Hibiscus is one of my favorites and I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"My review is based solely on their vegan ice cream. We were walking past their store on Pedestrian Sunday and came across the little Hibiscus ice cream cart where they were giving out samples of the vegan ice creams. They were selling mung bean milk based flavours such as pistachio, as well as coconut milk based ice creams like strawberry basil, coconut vanilla, and lemon mint. 

As soon as we sampled the lemon mint, we knew we need not sample further. The lemon mint comes across very creamy and lemony with only a mild mint essence. There are pieces of lemon rind in the ice cream which adds to the texture of the ice cream. It was almost like having a lemon cheesecake or lemony key lime pie. Two scoops came to $7.90 taxes in. My niece loved the ice cream so much that she was licking the bowl! 

Even if you're not vegan, you have to try Hibiscus, at least for their ice cream!  If the high quality vegan ice cream is a representative of the quality of the rest of their foods, I look forward to coming back and trying some of their other offerings."}
{"text":"Stepping inside you would notice the shine, gloss and dark lighting as with any high end Thai place. I felt a little claustrophobic as the restaurant was tiny. There were few waitress running around but no one was taking care of the front table. The waitress handling the bar had to come down the long around way to come to me waiting at the door. Not so good to make your customers waiting. I was too tired that day to eat at the restaurant so I ordered by phone and the person on he other said my order would be ready in 20 mins. I reached the restaurant after 25 minutes and ended up waiting 25 more minutes till they cooked up my batch. No one offered me a table or chair to sit while I wait, so I invited myself over to an empty table and sat down.

The food finally came and I took home the red curry and fried rice. It wasn't so great - the fried rice seemed like brown rice but what I actually wanted was White rice. The Red curry was okay but not the best. After all my experience with Hibiscus didn't go well.

May be the dine in customers would hold a different opinion owing to the incredible star rating it has now!"}
{"text":"Love this spot. Perfect for a healthful lunch. Definitely check it out."}
{"text":"My wife and I were looking for a good vegan place for brunch.   Thank you Yelpers for steering us this way.   

I got their Vegan Mozzarella, Tomato, Basil, Spinach, & Mushroom buckwheat crepe, which was damn good.   I had never had a buckwheat crepe before, and now I find myself wondering \"why don't they serve buckwheat crepes everywhere?\" -- so much better than the standard crepe IMHO.   

My wife had a large Quinoa Salad.    I had a bite of her salad and it was even better than my crepe.   I had quinoa envy after that bite. :)    I thought that a \"large\" should have been a bit larger than that however.

The place was quite hot  warm inside; not unbearable, but it a little cooler would have been nice.   

Also the service was quite slow and disorganized.  The servers were pleasant, but you had to work to get them to come to your table, and then once you finally got an order in you had to wait a very long time for the order to come up.   Nonetheless, we enjoyed the food so much I am still giving this place 4 stars."}
{"text":"Vegan, hip, and fresh! 

Hibiscus unfortunately does not beat out other vegan gems like Urban Herbivore or K&K in my heart since it has less menu variety (vegan buckwheat crepes, bowl, soup) - but lots of options (savory crepes with cool fillings like pear and walnuts, sweet crepes with hazelnut spread and fruits, etc). 

I strongly recommend getting the salad bowl here at least once - it has 42 ingredients! There's kale (kind of tough and prickly, least favorite ingredient, but yes it is one of the most nutritious), quinoa, carrots, beets, kelp glass noodles (so crunchy so fascinating!), tofu, sunflower seeds, lentils, sweet potatoes, raw cracker (I have no idea what it is, but it's a bit sweet and reminds me of a type of Chinese thin pancake called \"jianbing\"). The crepes here are less impressive in my opinion, but they're pretty large and filled with wholesome goodness (savory ones). For lunch today I ordered the soup + salad bowl combo ($15). The soup options were mushroom vs ginger squash. The mushroom soup had lots of root vegetables, including potatoes, which makes it creamier (still vegan though since no milk products, hence no actual cream). I chose the ginger squash, which was a puree and definitely contained a subtle ginger note.

The food here is a bit cheaper than Urban Herbivore next door ($8-15 vs $10-20), but still pretty expensive as most vegan places are. The portions are also smaller, which I view as a plus since after one Urban Herbivore main I usually feel so stuffed.

Try their vegan ice cream! $4 per scoop or $7 per 2 scoops. There's multiple different flavors and you can choose between coconut milk-based, mung bean milk-based, or almond milk based. My partner ordered a lemon mint coconut milk-based scoop (very sorbet-like, not too sweet) and I ordered an almond chocolate almond milk-based scoop (also not overly sweet, but creamier than the lemon mint). I also tried the pistachio mung bean milk-based flavor and loved it too since it was the sweetest of the ones I tried and creamy.

Loses 1 star for the too small venue - it can be difficult to find a seat, especially if coming with a group larger than 2.

Will be back!"}
{"text":"I've only eaten in Hibiscus once but have gotten their takeout salad more than a dozen times. The first time we had their 42 ingredient salad which could have filled both of us with the large because of the delicious variety of ingredients. The cheese, tofu, quinoa and gogi berries are some of my favorite in there. 

We also got the vegan mozza/spinach/mushroom buckwheat crepe, it wasn't the best I've had but it was pretty darn good. Everything tasted fresh and the crepe wasn't soggy or over whelming. 

Back to the salad! The small is filling enough for lunch and they pack it in this air tight container with your flax seed crisp on the outside. You don't feel super full afterwards and it's delicious. 

I always have room for their almond brownie vegan square they sell by the cash. It's pretty addicting!"}
{"text":"Excellent Thai food. Just the right amount of spice! I had the cashew nut and my wife had the Pad Thai.  They were both great!"}
{"text":"This is my response to the owner, no I'm not confused. My total for the teas was $6, $3 each for 2 like I mentioned. Then your waitress herself came back and explained to me that the $3 on top of that was tip for the bartender and that doesn't go to her. I'm absolutely certain.

Was excited in more options for Asian cuisine but,  larb was tasteless & stick to Thai house for pad Thai.  My grandmother & I requested hot sauce to save the dishes. They give you 3 that you have to scrape for so in her words, \"they are so stingy.\" It was good hot sauce though.

We order the hibiscus & green tea.  Hibiscus is pretty,  comes in clear coffee press type glass with pretty herbs in it. The green tea has to be assembled yourself & comes with a timer.  But in the end they charge me a bartenders fee on the tab,  no mention of this prior. I was confused,  the server told me it's a bartenders tip. So these are my problems with that: 
1. They require you to pay gratuity,  it's not even an option. What place doesn't just tip out like normal? Whether it's for bartenders,  hostess, busboys etc...
2. The required rate seems to be 50% bc they charged me $3 extra for $6 worth of tea.  I'm not overly upset about a few bucks but if you spend $50, $40 on drinks,  then the automatic extra charge on that is $25, $20 etc.??
3. Who told them it requires a bartender to pour tea?
4. You made me pay tip, but made us do half the work by steeping half of it ourselves with a oddly shaped teabag.  
How does any of this add up? 

I looked forward to this place for awhile & finally had the chance to stop in after a shopping trip closeby & a way for us to wait  on 5 o clock traffic to die down, but we left very unimpressed.  A star for nice service but that's it. Oh wait, the mango rice was good. We had 2 apps but they were just ok."}
{"text":"We stopped in at this place on a trip to Greensboro, NC. It was rush hour in Charlotte, so we dropped off the interstate and made our way here. I'm glad we did. 

The food was delicious. The atmosphere was quaint and different--albeit a bit dark. 

The price was a bit high, but this place is in a fancy little shopping center, so I imagine the rent is higher than normal (excuse me, but I'm from a small town -- probably not all that fancy). 


I'll just say they had the best kimchi I've had in a long time. My wife even enjoyed the food and she normally scoffs when I say I want to have Korean food. The only time I get to have it is when we go out of town, though, because there isn't a Korean joint within 3 hours of our hometown. 


All of the food was delicious, but even months later I remember that kimchi. I believe I had bulgogi from there too and it was outstanding if I recall. I definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"The vegan mozzarella crepe that I had was mouth watering good! Service was really good. Really liked the ambiance there as well - great for brunch with friends! The only complaint that I had were the prices - they were a bit high for crepes."}
{"text":"The food is alright but not particularly memorable. Most of the times I've tried to come here they've been closed --- they seem to either be closed or packed to the brim."}
{"text":"I'm originally from Hawaii where we eat a lot of Korean food.  I was so excited to have real Korean food so close to my home. Bi bim bap in a stone bowl is the real thing, plus homemade kochuchang.  Other good thing is there are A LOT of other Asians eating here, so you know it's the real thing."}
{"text":"Pretty good! I had a large salad. It was a cute place but I probably wouldn't go back. Since I'm not a vegan, id prefer a place that serves meat."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch, place was completely empty but we went for it anyways! Food was ok, I got the Caramelized Pork Stew (Thom Khem) which was $10. This is what I came for because I loved eating this as a kid. It was ok, the serving size was pretty small and flavour was ok. Service was very slow considering we were the only people in the restaurant. BF and I left still hungry. 

There is a parking lot behind the plaza."}
{"text":"The salad bowl here is AMAZING.  I kind of hate ordering salads at restaurants, because you look at it, and can identify everything pretty easily, and basically why not make it at home?  The salads at Hibiscus are not like this - they fill a bowl with 8 or 9 different (non-leafy) salads.  Beet salad, carrot salad, soy paste, sweet potato salad, broccoli, beans, quinoa, tofu - really amazing.  Everything tastes super fresh and wonderful (probably because of the sesame oil).  The large salad is enough for a meal and costs something ridiculous like $5.75.  You can add a soup (usually puréed and pretty delish) for another $1.50, I think.  Basically, it's an amazing lunch deal.

The crepes are also out-of-control.  I recommend the cheddar and chutney, it is wonderful.

The shortcomings at Hibiscus aren't so bad: the hours are not great if you have anything to do during the day (like work), as they close at six, ish and aren't open on Sunday.  They also put this weird eggplant pesto in all the savoury crepes, it tastes pretty good with most of them, but should probably be left out of the brie and walnut combo...  The quinoa isn't the best, but everything else is pretty unparalleled.

The owners are basically the nicest people I can imagine running a restaurant.  I used to go get lunch specials on Bloor or College, but I pretty much only eat lunch out here now."}
{"text":"I had the 42 ingredient salad and it was amazing, 4 stars because the service was extremely slow."}
{"text":"Yessssir, four stars for you Hibiscus! A definite 'Yay! I'm a fan.' :) I'll definitely come by some time again to try your salads, crepes and whatnot!

On a beautiful Pedestrian Sunday afternoon, my friends and I awkwardly entered this new (to us) establishment because I had read the raving reviews on yelp and convinced them to try the ice cream, :D. 

The atmosphere was warm and bustling. This little place was packed with barely any standing room. But no matter! We were immediately attended by Kaoru who graciously waited and took our ice-cream orders. This turned out to be the perfect place because one of my cohorts is deathly allergic to peanuts - we were glad they were completely peanut free, :). 

I got the Coconut Raspberry as well as the Black Sesame. Yuuuum.  Both of which weren't too sweet and had a lovely after-taste. Also tried the Mango which was especially flavourful and the Chocolate brownie was nomnomnom. Yes. It. Is. Good. They make their own ice-cream.

Two scoops makes four dollars. Three for five. (One for three.) The waffle cone was deee-lish. Crunchy and /not/ stale! Not sweet, good texture and it held its form. However, if you get the ice-cream in a cup the serving is larger! By A LOT! ;D"}
{"text":"The A/C was either broken or switched off. So I sweated through my lunch.
I ordered the Budda Bowl A: which was a spring roll, rice, edename  and Bulgolgi. It's nice that you can customize. But they gave me what I consider to be JapChae. It was tasty and a good portion for 10 bucks but they still lost two stars."}
{"text":"Best salad in the city! I've been a vegetarian for 9 years now and have only recently discovered this veggie gem. Super fast service, always fresh and delicious. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Thanks to you fellow Yelpers I found this gem! 

I am only giving it 4 Stars because unfortunately they were not serving any of their sushi since the sushi chef is alway until 11/16/16. 

I went in on a Thursday night w a friend, the place wasn't busy at all and we sat at the bar. I was glad to see that they were getting numerous pick up orders.  

Started off w the Papaya Salad which was really good...their level 3 of spicy is true. Make sure to ask for extra peanuts if you are a fan since the serving was light on them.  The vegetable spring rolls were very fresh. 

They have a full bar and some specialty cocktails which were excellent. Try the Leechy martini!

Last but not least, if you are a pho or soup fan, I would recommend the Vientiane Noodle Kow Piek Sen. The restaurant makes their own noodles and they are great! 

can't wait to be back. 

Thank you Yelpers!!"}
{"text":"Cute little vegetarian and vegan friendly joint with crêpe selections, desserts and coffee. When my friend and I first walked in I was blown away by it's amazing scents of delicious foods! Must go back and try other items on the menu."}
{"text":"Staff is really nice and non-intrusive, my friend and I could have been here hours without that awkward feeling that we've spent too long there.
Atmosphere was really nice, it has a clean but comfortable feeling thats unexpected of kensington.

I had the soup and salad, my friend had the crepes with fruit and chocolate chips, we both thoroughly enjoyed our meals. Lots of dairy-free options without having to sub or leave out anything.

Everything was reasonably priced especially considering the nice atmosphere I wil be bringing people here often, great place to bring friends."}
{"text":"It was amazing!
We had the soup and salad combo and it was the best salad I have ever had!!!
The place was neat! Although a little bit small."}
{"text":"Walked in because I heard good things about the ice cream.

Hibiscus is a small place, with maybe 5-8 or so tables inside and 3 outside. It feels a bit cramped, but it's cute. It looks to be a good place for a date.

The ice cream was amazing- I tried the pistachio and chai masala. It's dairy-free, but I didn't even miss regular ice cream after trying it here. The pistachio ice cream was full of nuts, and the chai masala had a nice flavouring of spices. The spice got a bit overwhelming at one point, but I could counteract the effect with the pistachio being mixed into it. 

It's reasonably priced for a good sized portion, $4 for two scoops; $2 for one (tax included). 

I didn't try anything else on the menu, but from what I could see there were a lot of crepes, and some soup and salad options. It's a small menu, but I'm definitely coming back here to try something else."}
{"text":"Don't let the modest looks deceive you. The food is great!  An interesting mix of Thai, Korean and Japanese selections. Lettuce wraps are great, my kids love the Pad Thai, and my wife loves the Korean pancakes. 

Try a sampling of various items and go family style for a delightful surprise of well prepared Asian food by a locally owned place the likes of which we need more of in Charlotte!"}
{"text":"Hibiscus is cute, clean and serves some of the best vegan ice cream in the city. However, if you are someone who likes their food to have flavour or any seasoning whatsoever, I would not recommend their savoury crepes. The vegan mozzarella was good but that was about the only redeeming factor of my meal. I will definitely continue going to Hibiscus - but only to get my Green Tea Ice Cream fill."}
{"text":"I had higher hopes for Hibiscus based on the other reviews, so I'm hoping we just hit it on a weird night. Some friends and I came in for dinner after work on a Tuesday, and we grabbed a booth. It's down the stairs at Parktowne Village, and on the right. The bar is at the front, and the booths/tables are at the back, which means between the lack of windows and the dark purple/black/silver decor, we felt like we were in a cave. I was honestly surprised the sun was still out when we left because I thought it should be pitch black.

Our waitress was fantastic and checked on us just enough. For dinner, I got Grandma's Bibimbap ($14), which was... fine. The sauce it came with was too hot for me, so I didn't use any sauce, and that probably made it drier than I liked. My friends got the Fire Phoenix roll ($14 which came literally on fire and had to be blown out) and the green curry ($14), and they said both were really good.

Strangely enough, whenever the air conditioner would kick on, an odd smell would fill the restaurant. We all decided it smelled like wet dog and were glad when it shut off.

Overall, it was fine, but I don't know that I'd be in a hurry to go back."}
{"text":"Ordered the pad Thai and Tom yum soup. Tom yum was great - a little coconut-y but good. The pad Thai tasted like noodles covered in ketchup. It was horrible. We had to throw it out bec it was so bad."}
{"text":"Best. Food. Ever !!! The name- Hibiscus is what drawn me to this place at first. (luv at first sight??) I cannot expressed how much I love this place, the vibe & location it's in, the food, decor, service just everthang! I came here with my mom, and cousin and we were seated right away. ( they weren't super busy ) The place was on the smaller side, but it had that cozy restaurant feeling maybe because of the cute decors?? Our server was also so kind, she was really attentive, she didn't mind when we asked for substitutions & also checked on us regularly(: We literally ordered half of the menu lol! (We shared the food of course) We ordered the green curry, grandmas bimbibap, shrimp tempura burrito, seafood pancake and the purple sticky rice w/ vanilla icecream. Let me just start off telling ya the food did not fail to disappoint. I think my fav would be the seafood pancake- it came out hot and crispy! The curry, I'm legit so picky about my curry like a girl KNOWS her curry. The green curry was PERFECT; it had all the right flavors and the coconut was on point! And the PURPLE STICKY RICE?? When I saw purple & sticky rice, I was like I have to order that! Haha 2 of my fav things combined, the sticky rice had coconut milk on it and it came out warm combined with the cold vanilla ice cream it was so bomb. Don't worry about it being too sweet, I'm not an intense sweet person so this was perfect! I could just go on and on raving about this place, but if you like quality, legit tasty food- be sure check them out!!"}
{"text":"Updated in response to managers snarky attitude... 

1. I may have misidentified the wrapping of my spring roll. But, I can assure you that I pried the wrapping apart to find nothing but cabbage. There were no carrots, nor vermicelli. 

2. My palette is not delicate. Your sauce was watery and the potatoes were RAW. 

3. Instead of trying to make customers look like idiots, you should improve your culinary skills and customer service mindset. There's no excuse for the standard of food and lack of service your restaurant provided."}
{"text":"Ever since I had the buckwheat galette from Paris' Breizh Cafe, I can't stop thinking about it. They're so thin, lacy, crispy and delicate - it's so addictive!

Hibiscus' sweet buckwheat crepes (Chocolate Hazelnut Banana) is soggy and has a rubbery kind of feel to them. It also has a gritty flavour/texture - I know buckwheat flour are suppose to have gritty taste but the overpowering gritty taste just ruins it for me. 

Normally the combination of chocolate hazelnut and banana is a perfect match made in heaven but this time Hibiscus sweet buckwheat crepes is an epic fail!"}
{"text":"I came to this cute little restaurant in Kensington for a late Sunday afternoon brunch.

The restaurant was completely full around noon - very popular for weekend brunch goers. We both decided to try the vegan mozzarella, tomato, basil, spinach and mushroom savoury crepe, which the waitress recommended as one of their most popular crepes. Because we wanted to try the chutney as well, they also offered to give some chutney on the side. 

The crepes came very quickly despite the fully seated restaurant. Overall I enjoyed my crepe - the outside was like a caprese salad, and the extra avocado and zucchini on the top were nice. The crepe was very filling, especially from the heavy vegan cheese. Hoping to try the brie and pear crepe next time!

I highly recommend Hibiscus, especially for any vegan restaurant goers!"}
{"text":"Went here with some friends last night. Loved the ambiance and food and wait staff were both fantastic. Very accommodating and offered to let us try several new things. We will definitely be back and are definitely looking forward to trying everything on the menu!!"}
{"text":"My inspiration to making better vegetarian dishes. I'm not Vegan or vegetarian.

I love the ambiance. It's an eclectic mixture of furnitures in one tiny space.

I can't stress how I used to dislike salad, but Hibiscus inspired me. It doesn't have to be the boring greens with dressing. I loved their salad. It has so many levels of flavour and texture. It's filling if you order the full size.

I'm a huge fan of crepes too! I didn't even know there was such a big selection until I saw the menu. I ordered two savoury spinach, tomato with cheese and apple walnut crepe, with a side of salad along with a sweet banana, nutella crepe as dessert. It's so fresh!

Be sure to eat your crepes fast, so they stay crispy, rather than have it turn chewy. I shall be back for more..."}
{"text":"Wait staff are easygoing and service is not rushed. Food is clean/fresh and tasty.  Price is reasonable and food presentation is done well."}
{"text":"Vegetarian dishes are usually easier to tolerate than vegetarians but this isn't the case here.  The menu is limited to salads and crepes which is hardly a creative use of vegetarian cuisine.  

Service:  My girlfriends salad arrived 5 minutes before my $9 basil, tomato, and goat cheese crepe.  

The Food:
Crepe: Rather than being a dish, the crepe consists of separate items on a plate. First you eat some heavily peppered tomatoes followed by a bushel of basil, then a tablespoon of goat cheese wrapped in crepe.  If it were any worse I would have punched them for insulting me.
Salad Bowl: Very good.

Just because you are a vegetarian doesn't mean you can only eat soup and salad.  Having a one hit restaurant doesn't qualify you for the 4-5 stars this place is getting.  Are vegetarians so hard up in Toronto that this passes as quality?"}
{"text":"This vegan restaurant is incredible and in a really great location in Kensington Market. I had the  salad and soup, because I just had to see what all they put in a 42-ingredient salad! Of course I couldn't finish it all, but it was so delicious. Great casual atmosphere, it was a good place to spend a break during my day solo traveling."}
{"text":"Recently purchased a Groupon for this well-rated restaurant.  Wanted to use on a Friday night, but at the door we were told that the Groupon wasn't accepted on the weekend. OK, we are already here, so we'll pay full price.  At 8:00 pm on a Friday night no wait and not even half full.  We were promptly seated and ordered some cocktails.  Waited 10 minutes, finally the server brought drinks, but not what we had ordered.  We waited another 5 minutes, no drinks, so decided to leave.  As we were walking out we met the server who had our drinks, but too late.  

Again, the restaurant was not even 1/2 full on a Friday night prime time.  Doesn't speak well for the longevity.  Will try to take advantage of our Groupon soon."}
{"text":"Wonderful choice for my gluten free and vegetarian friends. I've been twice and thoroughly enjoyed my experience. This time had a chai latte and goat cheese tomato crepe. Very delicious!"}
{"text":"This was the best restaraunt in my time at Toronto. I am not a big vegan food fan but the soup and salad were perfectly balanced and seasoned. I was pleasantly surprised by how fresh and tasty it was. A bit cramped and not much other variety prevents it from a five, but this is a must-visit in Kensington Market"}
{"text":"Cute little place in a trendy location. Not all carrot ginger soup is created equally, but theirs is created with love, care, and a splash of wonderful. The staff were sweet and attentive"}
{"text":"LOVE THIS PLACE! Will be back for sure. After doing an elimination diet and having a new found appreciation for companies that cater to people who can't eat stuff, I decided to try this place.

It was sooooooooo good.

I ordered the vegan mozarella, mushroom and tomato buckwheat crepe. I want to eat another. Of course it is a savoury crepe, but they drizzled maple syrup on it, and it was to die for. The texture and taste of the crepe was perfect and there was so much non-soy vegan cheese inside it, they were very generous with it. 

I don't know why I didn't order desert, that was a bad mistake.

The staff there were very nice too. One of the cooks (the owner maybe?) saw that I was waiting in line to order, so he came by and suggested some of his favourite dishes. I already knew what I wanted though, so I ordered it. I waited at a table by the window and enjoyed people watching Kensington market people. Then when my crepe arrived I downed it. I personally really like health conscious restaurants because I do think they are more creative and they really pay attention to quality and taste. The price was about $10 for a delicious lunch. Can't wait to eat there again. Oh yes, I eat meat and eggs too and yet I was satisfied :D"}
{"text":"I am not a vegan. I do love meat but I often find that vegan restaurants have really tasty food and are very creative. This is one of them.
I had the salad and soup combo.
The soup of the day was the squash and ginger soup, very yummy! The salad was also excellent and pretty fullfilling.
Staff was very friendly and professionnal, fast to react.

I definitely recommend this place. It is quite small and gets packed during lunch hour."}
{"text":"I am the first time here and everything I ordered today is fantastic. All the appetizer, entrees, and desserts are so delicious and good looking. Besides, the environment is perfect and the waiter is friendly and informative. I highly recommend this restaurant to everyone."}
{"text":"Love the salad till the end of the world!! So delicious and full of variety!!!
The restaurant is not very conspicuous because of its simple and clean decoration outside. But actually it is always crowded during lunch time and famous for its healthy food.
I chose the Salad and Soup to go. The staff there were all so friendly and atmosphere was very comfortable. I felt a little regretted because I cannot enjoy it at view seats.
The soup, to be honest, was not my dish because of the ginger flavor. But the salad really makes me die for it...Beans, squish, yam, quinoa, spinach and a piece of gluten-free wheat chip~ All the ingredients are fresh and tasty!! Such a large portion of meal just cost $14. I thought it deserves the price.
Must go back for their crepe~ Look very delicious too."}
{"text":"I got the Bulgogi. The beef was nicely marinated and full of flavor. I was a little disappointed it did not have a sunny side egg on top of the dish...as I have been to S. Korea and was accustomed to gettingv it that way. I enjoyed the dish and atmosphere. But, it was a little pricey."}
{"text":"I've already been here twice and I can fully say this place does not disappoint.
Got the salad and soup and both we're just amazing! 

Personally I'm not vegan (maybe a meatatarian ahha), but this place rocks. The house salad will be the most filling thing you ever eat and the best part? It's not your everyday salad. There's so much going in there and the best part that EVERYTHING (actually EVERYTHING) is good for you. You got your quinoa, sweet potato, kale, non-soy, vegan tofu, and much more going on, it's like a dance party in your mouth but even better. It's also super filling, and you can't even feel guilty because everything they put in the salad is GOOD for you (ACTUALLY). 

The soup is also not to be underestimated. I had the house soup and I believe it was ginger squash. mmmmm, it was so nice and warm and soupy and it makes you feel all cosy inside, especially if you have a cold. 

They also have a crazy assortment of crepes made of buckwheat batter (for those trying to avoid white flour like moi) of both the savory and sweet variety which I still have yet to try.

Vegan ice-cream is also available which a great variety of flavors that change every so often. During my second visit, I even saw someone coming back to the restaurant just to compliment who was working behind the cash about how good the ice cream was. 

The service is impeccable. Everyone is lovely, and you feel like they genuinely care about you. 

I'm definitely coming sometime soon again, AND YOU SHOULD TOO."}
{"text":"wow... from the first bite I LOVED Hibiscus!
Their soup and salad combo was unbeatable! The staff was genuine and warm...

Seriously, I love this place!!!"}
{"text":"Cheap and decent priced vegan food. According to my friend, she said that they recently renovated this place and I must say, it looks great. It is very small inside with probably like 4-5 tables and there's an open kitchen which is always a plus for me!

The menu here is very simple and small. They offer drinks, crepes, salads and soups.

I got the crepe and it was really delicious! Simple but simple done well. Both of my friends got the soup and salad combo. The soup was great and the salad was one of the best salads that I've ever eaten before. There were beets in there and I absolutely hate beets but they managed to make it tasty by pairing it up with all sorts of other veggies.

I will definitely be back for more!"}
{"text":"This is hands down one of the best Thai place I have come across in Charlotte. We have been to this place multiple times and the quality and service hasn't disappointed so far. Red and green (veg) curries are really sumptuous along with Veg fried rice. The spice level is also true to what you order. If you are craving for Thai food, this is place to go !!"}
{"text":"After reading all these rave reviews, i just had to go and try this place!  The restaurant was on the small side as they only had about 20 seats in total but it is really cute and looks like a tea/coffee shop.  

I had a salad and soup combo ($7.50) and we got a bowl of all the different kinds of salads they had that day and a cup of squash/lentil soup.  I loved the fact that there is a variety so every bite is different and you never get bored.  There were so many kinds of salads: quinoa, tofu, broccoli, beets, sweet potato, string beans and chick peas.  All of the salads were tasty without being so saucy you can't taste the vegetables.  I believe if you had a favorite, you can choose to just have one salad instead of a little bit of everything.  The pureed soup was a great accompaniment to the salads and I liked the fact that they serve it in mugs so it is easy to drink.

Hibiscus offers a vegan and gluten free menu.  My boyfriend often has digestive issues but had no problems after eating at Hibiscus.  They also have soy ice cream that you can eat in or take out.  Next time I am in the neighborhood, I'll be sure to stop in for some soy ice cream.  Will definitely be back soon."}
{"text":"Wonderful! One of the best vegetarian spots I've ever been to. The food was so fresh, delicious and beautifully prepared.

I had the soup (mushroom bisque) and salad. My wife had one of the savoury crepes, which she loved as well.

The iced matcha tea was a treat too. I just wish this place was in my neighborhood!"}
{"text":"Surprise of my year thus far!

Meat eating people, please read!! I confess that I am nowhere near being a vegetarian but when you have a partner who is vegetarian and in need of gluten free food - well, it expands your culinary palette.

So, would I have gone to a place with non-meat otherwise? Hell, no! But after trying the food here. I have changed my mind.

I had a fantastic crepe that just happens to be good for all you vegetarians and gluten free folks.  It was a buckwheat crepe with mushrooms, spinach and mozzarella. Cost $9.00.   The only thing I can say I wanted on that is more cheese but that's just a preference. Otherwise, seasoning was bang on!  

My americano was alright! Good enough to make my meal better than the usual accompanying coffee with brunch.  I would order it again.

What blew me away on top of that deliciousness was their ice cream made of mung bean paste.  I couldn't believe it!  It tasted so good!   This has to be one of those aha moments of wonder.  I had no idea that a bean could make ice cream.   i loved it!


On top of that, customer service was excellent. Helpful and friendly despite how busy this little place is."}
{"text":"We had high hopes. We really did. My daughter is working toward becoming vegan, so based on reviews, we visited Hibiscus. We ordered salad--the only salad they serve--and soup--the only soup they served that day. The mushroom soup arrived in coffee mugs. The overall effect was awful, as the soup tasted like nothing more than liquefied mushrooms. It was like drinking mushroom juice by the spoonful. No amount of pepper and salt made it more palatable. It was easily the worst soup I have ever had in my life. Ever. And I'm old 
   It's not all bad. I thought the salad was amazing. For a salad boasting 42 ingredients, the flavors and textures complimented one another perfectly. It was so delicious, that I ate nearly the entire large salad myself, as my daughter did not like it at all. This is likely because the mushroom soup was so disturbing to her, that nothing would have been acceptable at that point. 
   There was a steady stream of people coming in for carry out while we ate, and if I lived here, I would definitely get the salad on occasion, but would get carry out, as customer service was pretty much non-existent. After dropping off our food, the waiter never came back to our table. Never. Ever. I had to ask a waitress if she'd clear our still full soup mugs, explaining that neither of us cared for it. Then I had to go up to the register and pay without ever having received a bill. No discount for not having eaten any of the soup. No apology for not liking the soup. No offer for anything else instead. So, overall, Hibiscus was a disappointment, with a great salad."}
{"text":"I'm complete obsessed with this place.  It's so on trend right now with the hip Asian places opening up!  Decor is super cool and I absolutely recommend this place for a date if you want to look like you know all the best hidden gems in down.  Dark walls and cool frames on the wall are a nice, chic touch.

There's no better way to start out your experience here than with a cocktail.  I recommend the  Fall Fashion and the Apple Pen.  BTW-this drink was inspired by the Apple Pen video that went viral about a year or two ago...Google it and you'll totally get the name.

Apps come out pretty quick.  I've personally had the edamame, vegetable spring rolls and the dumplings (my top recommendation).  But don't fill up too much, because you HAVE to save room for a great dinner.  The Pad See Yew, Pad Thai and fried rice are all fantastic.  If you're feeling a little adventurous, go with the Bibimbap.  It's great.

I'm totally on board with this restaurant.  Although it's tucked away and you could completely miss it if you blinked while driving by, it's worth the search."}
{"text":"BEST STICKY RICE! 

I've been looking for the best rice since Thailand and I finally found it!! Great atmosphere even better Thai food. New favorite restaurant on Montford!"}
{"text":"I've ordered takeout from here several times and it's been delicious every time. I did dine in once with a friend and both of us enjoyed our meals, as well as our drinks. My favorites so far are the Pad Thai, Green Curry and Basil Kai Dao. Will definitely be back to try out other dishes and enjoy their drink specials!"}
{"text":"Great food and great service.. Will be top 5 places for lunch and dinner.. Great mixture of dishes from different cultures.. Recommend everyone to give them a try"}
{"text":"Crunchy dirty string in my take out meal that went in my throat. They refused to give a refund and it was incredibly disgusting.


Updated following restaurant reply: No (partial or full) refund in any way was offered. Instead, a credit to your restaurant was offered which was not appealing to me after food poisoning one time and string the next...very good to know that the string was in no way related to food, and just off of one of your employee's person. Thank you so much for your help."}
{"text":"I came here with my girl friends for our monthly brunch.  We decided to go here since my friend was needing some gluten-free food due to her diet.  So we ended up here due to the reviews.  We were there exactly at 12 on the dot.  Surprisingly, not too many people, but we found that there were a lot of people around 1 PM.

Four of my friends had ordered the soup and salad combo (yeah, we're not very creative) and one friend had the tomato, basil, mushroom crepe.  We never got to try her crepe, but I can definitely recommend the soup and salad combo.  The soup that we had that day was the ginger/squash soup.  The salad was great -- a great combination of different types of salad (including broccoli, quinoa, yams, etc.)

Service was great as well.  However, washrooms were a tad annoying -- there was only one washroom, and a huge line-up.  Otherwise, quite healthy for a decently priced meal."}
{"text":"This place was a random find for me.   We popped across the street from the Sheraton centre in Toronto into what we thought was a restaurant...but it was more of a food court. I found Hibiscus tucked away in a corner on the upper level. They have vegan and gf crepes, salad, bowl, and squares and ice cream. I had the spinach, mushroom and tomato crepe. The guy making it took such pride in making it and plating it perfectly. It was SO delicious.
I took an almond butter chocolate chip square to go and they gave me a glass of water upon request. 
I forgot to ask if they give a discount with the veg card.
I will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"All the crepes are gluten-free. Most of them aren't vegan, since they come with cheese, but they do serve one made with vegan cheddar. Not spectacular, but really decent, since it's hard to appreciate how effing hard gluten-free baking is until you try it yourself at home and flop over and over and over... Tiny space that gets crowded very quickly, so it's best to come early if you really want a table. 

ACCESSIBILITY: Steps up to restaurant."}
{"text":"My 14-year-old daughter and I went here on a Sunday at 1 o'clock. It was not crowded at all and had a nice swanky atmosphere. The waiter was very attentive! I had the lychee martini. I loved it, not too sweet and a nice refreshing light drink. My daughter had the Thai tea, it was creamy and delicious. We had edamame for an appetizer. My daughter ordered the papaya salad and I ordered the green chicken curry. My daughter did not like the papaya salad and it was returned to the kitchen with no questions asked. She then ordered the shrimp pad Thai and loved it. The shrimp was cooked very well, they were tender and soft. The noodles were homemade. I think it was the best pad Thai I had ever tried. My curry, which I never had before was earthy and sweet and I loved the basil in it."}
{"text":"Seating is a little cramped, but the food makes it worth it! Have had crepes here a couple of times and will be back again at some point I'm sure :)"}
{"text":"Five stars for a vegan place, coming from a used-to-be carnivore, is a big deal. My mum (who forced me to eat vegetables for 18 years of my life) is proud.

Was going out for brunch with a vegetarian friend and did not want to go to Fresh, so I picked this place after hearing so many good things about it. I was skeptical at the beginning, as I do not really like vegetarian meals (I need my meat). 

We got there at 1pm on a Saturday, the place was packed, it is a very small place. Waiter was nice and friendly. He kept on ensuring us he was trying his best to accommodate us. After we got seated finally, he asked and found out it was our first time, and was very helpful with his suggestions/recommendations. 

I got the soup and salad combo. It was really good. I can survive eating meatless meals, but I usually would not go for it. Having eaten a vegan meal a few days before, I was not at all excited for the food. To my surprise, I actually like the food and (for the first time in my life) enjoyed eating without my meat. 

We decided to try the ice cream after knowing that it is dairy-free and gluten-free. I have never tried non-dairy based ice creams. The pistachio ice cream stood out for me.

Overall, it is just a very enjoyable experience. Food, service, price, and ambiance are all on the higher end of the restaurant spectrum. 

PS. The waiter/waitress refills your glass with water every 2 minutes."}
{"text":"Hopscotching through Kensington Market, we came across Hibiscus, walked in and were greeted so nicely and invited to sample some Dark Chocolate, (Fair Trade, organic and upwards of 70% Cacao.) 
ooyahhh!
Then I was given a tour of the totally yummy looking Non Glutenous treats of which I bought:
1 rich dark Chocolate Brownie
1 Lemon Poppy cookie
1 Chocolate Chip, Chocolate cookie... 
because you can never have too much of a good thing :-)"}
{"text":"I walked in to grab a quick coffee and was greeted by a woman that clearly didn't want to be at work today. That should've been my immediate cue to leave. The entire interaction with her was obnoxious - she snatched the cash out of my hand and left the coffee on the register and didn't bother to tell me it was ready. I waited at least 10 mins at my table before it occurred to me that the coffee was ready. I asked for milk and she rolled her eyes and went to the back and managed to have a lengthy conversation with a coworker and returned empty handed. I asked her for the milk again and she rolled her eyes again and snarked back that she'll be back. Lady - I didn't ask you to move Mt Everest, it's just milk!! If you all are too busy to grab it then leave the milk and sugar on some sort of self-serve counter. I finally got some milk but left completely dissatisfied with the service. I will never return to this place again!"}
{"text":"Ordered delivery so, it may be different in restaurant but, portions were quite small. Soup was too salty. Fried rice a bit bland flavor wise but otherwise food was good. Try the mango sticky rice!"}
{"text":"This place is tucked into where the original Duckworth's was down in the courtyard of Park towne shopping center. 

The place is very quaint. The sweet hostess was very welcoming, cleared our plates and check in on us often.

The bulgogi was very good and reasonably priced I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"2nd meal at Hibiscus last night; spring rolls, beef salad, and red  curry with chicken. All were delicious and the owners/managers, Robert and Joanne (sp?), are consummate hosts. Intimate interior, outdoor seating in the courtyard; what more could you ask for? It's great to have them in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"This gem has a stellar location in Keningston Market; I certainly enjoyed the ecclectic vibe that surrounded the area. We came for lunch on a Saturday, and even though I would never classify myself as vegetarian, the food was exceptional and was probably my favorite spot in all of Toronto. Everything we ordered tasted delightfully fresh and healthy. I spilt the salad (the same one everyone continually raves about) with my friend, and we both ordred the tomato basil goat cheese crepe which was exceptional. I really liked the heartiness of the buckwheat flavor in contrast with a traditional crepe, and I found it to be much more filling than a regular crepe might have been. Also the salad contained every healthy thing imaginable tossed in a light dressing.  I was also very keen on trying their ice cream, since it was highly reccomeded. We had the chocolate almond milk ice cream which was light, but not lacking in terms of flavor. This place killed it all around."}
{"text":"Great place, great service and delicious food. I love Korean food. The bulgogi and bibimbap are delicious. Pricey but worth it. They have great tea. We will be back often."}
{"text":"Sad to say but my views on Hibiscuses have changed over the past year. I still do enjoy the salad bowl... A lot. Other than that a lot of change have been made to the place. First off; they renovated, new \"space\" slightly different layout. Really hipster chic if you ask me. They still have tables squished in there a couple inches from one & other. A lot of the tables aren't even. Drives me nuts! The service has gone down. I guess new staff. You have like 5 people serve you, never with a smile lately. The food takes forever, even just getting glasses of water take like a year & a day it feels like. The water is always warm too. Annoying. The food is still the same thankfully! The salad bowls are still hella yummy! The only thing is, like I mentioned before it takes forever to get food. The place is small, and they have a small menu. Please explain to me why it takes so long to get food! Something is not right there. Last thing that bums me out is quite a few times I've come here & they're randomly closed. Anyways, I will be back if I'm in the area because the food is still good but I no longer rave about the place!"}
{"text":"I was a skeptic. But silly me. Little did I know that healthful food done right can taste soooo good. 

We came here for brunch over the weekend. I forgot (didn't realize they'd be so busy) and didn't have a reservation. We waited a little bit (about ten minutes) but not long. We just went to the blue banana and they called or cellphone once they had a table. 

We started with a soup. We were warned that it was gingery... And we like ginger so we ordered it. They totally delivered on that promise. We also shared two crepes. One savory and one sweet. No gluten. No dairy, no eggs. (Yes, vegan). But yet it was so good. 

I felt silly asking the staff what I was eating a few different times because I couldn't believe it was GF. 

I actually really liked the food. So much so, I can't wait to come back and try more!"}
{"text":"The best meal I remember ever having. The salad was delicious with the perfect amount of dressing with the right flavors. My pear crepe had diverse but unique and complementing flavors. I love that it was all vegan, too."}
{"text":"Great waitstaff! The female waitress we had was super sweet and attentive. Everything we ordered was very good, my parent even agreed. Which is huge! I really liked their chicken lettuce wrap and papaya salad the most. Very flavorful and delicious. Def would love to come back and try the rest of the menu. Wasn't really a fan of the dark setting in the back area seating arrangement. Felt a little off from the rest of the place. Weird layout but foods were good."}
{"text":"This cute little restaurant will turn the biggest carnivore into a vegetarian for those couple of hours they spend at Hibiscus devouring their delicious meals.  We had the vegan crepes and the large salad and I loved both of them.  The crepes were way too big though to eat individually (especially since we ordered the salad) to share.  I would suggest to share a crepe.  I also think the crepe could use a bit more flavouring.  However, the salad was DELICIOUS.  One of the best salads I've had - ever!"}
{"text":"There are some restaurants you root for and you hope do well. Hibiscus is it for me. I have eaten there several times and service has always been warm and welcoming. These days good service can be rare. The servers always seem genuinely happy that you came. I was delighted to try a salad that was different than the same old leafy varieties. I tend to get the spinach, mozzarella and mushroom crepe and it is always fresh and delicious. The deserts are tempting as there is always an array of vegan treats to choose from. Definitely it is a must-try little café. I love it."}
{"text":"I had the chicken larb and loved it! I like mine spicy and our server brought several hot sauces to try. There wasn't a bad one in the bunch! I enjoyed the the purple sticky rice with green tea ice cream on top and it was awesome! My kids shared the chicken noodle soup (best chicken EVER). 
We'll be back for sure!!!"}
{"text":"I am a changed vegan now that I've found Hibiscus. If only it were open on Monday's too... that's my day off! The people (or family) who run this place are the NICEST ever. I was in heaven eating the salad bowl. I love all the variety and taste it contains. The raw cracker is amazing! I have only been once, but I plan to go back again and again. I want to try all those gf, vegan baked treats. I've tried 4 so far... a pumpkin chocolate brownie, a peanut butter chocolate bar, a dark chocolate cookie, and a rice crispie square. OMG! 

Hibiscus also serves up a few gf, vegan crepes that look intriguing. Those will be on order for next time. Definitely check this place out if you want an inexpensive, healthy, guilt free lunch or early dinner. That's the only other disappointment other than the Monday closing... that they close by 6:30 pm. That's too early for dinner!"}
{"text":"This place is so good, we went 2 days in a row so we could try more menu items! We went during a weeknight so it wasn't very busy which meant we got excellent service. We got the tuna sushi-rito wrapped in soy which actually had a good amount of tuna and crab in it (possibly because I specifically asked if there was a lot) and the red curry. Both were absolutely more than we expected taste-wise. The next day we got the bibimbap and the bulgogi, two more solid dishes. 

This is a great spot to take a date. The decor inside is very swanky yet soothing (make sure to check out the bathroom, it's like a spa). Also they have outdoor seating by the fountain. This will be a place we go on the regular.

Update: get the pad see yew with beef. Delicious."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. Nice ambience, a lot of good-looking people every time I go. As sad as it is, food that is healthy and cheap has become oxymoronic. Their prices are super low for the quality of food that you get.  Buckwheat crepes and the salad are my favourites. Shockingly tasty for vegan. Great service as well."}
{"text":"LOVE this place! This is where I go when I've been eating out too much and feeling guilty and in the mood for something filling and healthy. 

Not a lot of seating, so not a suitable place for big groups (like, more than 4), but very warm and inviting. 

The salad is like a delicious take on bibimbap -- a little mix of everything. Why hasn't anyone thought of this? Quality ingredients with tons of flavour. Quinoa, sweet potato, marinated tofu, green beans, shredded beets/carrots, lentils... So. Much. Protein! Felt really full afterwards. Probably the most satisfying salad I've had in ages. The gluten-free cracker it comes with is so tasty! I also got the soup of the day, which was a delicious squash soup with chunks of various veggies. Also amazing! I don't know what they are putting in the food to make it taste so amazing... At most places, usually it's butter... but here it is something else and I can't put my finger on it! 

I tried a bite of my friend's walnut, pear and brie crepe. Classic combo done to perfection. 

And the ice cream... My 2 friends and I each tried a different flavour: masala chai, earl gray, and mango coconut. Personally, the mango coconut was my favourite! But the other two were really yummy too. 

I have already gone back for take-out. Staff are friendly and efficient."}
{"text":"This was the latest stop for my dinner group. We were drawn to the place by the reviews on Yelp as well as the pictures. But unfortunately, things didn't turn out so well for our group.

I got there early and sat at the bar for a drink before the rest of the group. I enjoyed their mostly local beer tap selection and enjoyed talking with the bartender on beer.

When the group was seated that's when things took a turn downhill. There was one server for the entire restaurant and it was quite busy. He tried to keep up but the service just suffered.

We started with appetizers. I ordered the chicken lettuce wraps. While they were good, I felt there was something missing like a sauce? 

For an entree I ordered Grandma's Bibimbap which I heard was good here and I had never had Korean food (other than kimchi) before. While it came out presented well, my egg was over fried and not as pretty and the ones in the pictures on Yelp. The flavors were good but the chili paste which I thought was going to add some heat to the dish was quite disappointing. I didn't have the guts to ask for a bottle of siraccha. The kimchi that came with it was good as well as the pickled daikon but I really didn't care for the fish cake.

The good things about this restaurant are:

1. Friendly staff
2. Fresh ingredients and they try to support local as much as possible.
3. Food and cocktail items are beautifully presented.

The bad things:  

1. Service issues:  Drink orders were never placed, were extremely slow coming out and when they did come out, they were for wrong drink.
2. Didn't even ask if we wanted dessert, just brought the checks out. I ended up next door at Ben & Jerry's for my ice cream.

I'd really like to try this place again. Perhaps, I will try their Thai options. I was eyeing my table mate's Fresh ginger meal which looked amazing."}
{"text":"I was in town on business and wanted some take out noodles. I use the yelp take out app to pay for and place my order which was great! 

To find the place was a little odd for me as it is in a shopping mall/center and is downstairs so not visible from the main parking lot. 

The wait staff knew right away who I was and handed me my order, no wait or delay! I wasn't able to really check out the restaurant as I was grabbing and going, but it looked like a nice place. There were some folks at the bar that were enjoying themselves. 

The food was great! If you've ever gotten take out noodles you want everything separated... they did that!!! I opened the bag and was so grateful to see all the add ons in one container and the chicken curry in another container! Overall the curry was good, just what I was looking for, lots of pieces of chicken. I also got the spring rolls, not great. They used what seemed like bag lettuce in them instead of fresh cabbage or lettuce. 

If i'm in the area again I will definitely stop in and enjoy my meal in the restaurant!"}
{"text":"Thanks to my fellow Yelpers and all the raving reviews, my husband and I decided to make this 40 minute trip downtown for brunch on our day off...and what an experience! 

This place opens at 1130am and thank goodness we arrived right then. Place is pretty small so the seats were filled up by noon. Our servers were extremely patient and thoughtful. We had the salad and soup combo and the mozzarella, spinach and mushroom crepe; knowing my husband and I were splitting the meal our soup came in two coffee sized mugs. The salad was hearty, also one of the best we ever had. 

Then came dessert time! We ordered 4 scoops of ice cream to share. We had pistachio, earl grey, blueberry and chocolate almond. The latter two were so rich and flavourful it made the first two slightly bland (but still awesome)!

Last point to note, all this deliciousness came at an affordable price tag of $30 before tips. I will definitely come again."}
{"text":"Great flavour combinations, and nice to have somewhere veggie safe and reliable like this.  I find their prices higher than necessary though.  One of my go-tos is the big salad, but it ends up being a bit steep for what you get."}
{"text":"Was super pricey for the amount of food you got, and the wait was crazy long, but aside from that, friendly service and tasted great"}
{"text":"I can't believe the reviews here are so high. 4.5 stars for food this bland and expensive?

To start, the drinks are bad. My chai latte was watery and bland, whereas my SO's hot chocolate was incredibly sour and gritty. Yes, sour chocolate. Disgusting. 

The soup was okay, though. Standard issue puréed squash and ginger soup, no more and no less. 

The crepe with brie, apple, and walnut ($15!) was really disappointing. No flavor to be found, just so dull. I added an absurd amount of salt and pepper, all to no avail. His vegan dulce de leche crepe was better, the coconut caramel sauce was pretty decent considering how bad the rest of the offerings here are. 

Not worth it."}
{"text":"I seem to eat here everytime I'm in Toronto.  It is a tiny (if you don't come right at noon you are risking not having a seat) place that serves vegetarian and vegan friendly food.   There are really two main options on the menu, salad or crepes.  The crepes are wheat and not that good.  I've only made that mistake ounce.  The reason to come is for the soup and salad combo.  It is a bit expensive at $11 but it is healthy and delicious.  Both the soup and the salad tend to change, though there is a fair bit of consistency behind the general concept of each.  The salad has greens, lentils, quinua, beans, sweet potatoes, beets, seaweed and other things like that.  It somehow all goes together.  The soup is usually delicious, though once or twice we've had misses.

Service is always friendly, though it can be leisurely and the food doesn't always come out at the same time if your party orders a combo of crepes and salads.  My real complaint is that it is a bit spendy, but still a winner and I keep coming back."}
{"text":"Stellar food, always top-notch. Fresh, delicious and healthy is the words I'd use to describe this place. I've been going for years and it never disappoints. Also when you're done they have awesome homemade ice cream. I always have the soup and salad combo and it's so consistently good. Also they have free wifi plus a chill social atmosphere. Only neg is that they have somewhat limited hours, otherwise a Toronto must try, as it compares with healthy eats I've had in LA."}
{"text":"A wee little shop nestled in the midst of Kensington Market. Seating is super limited but there is friendly staff that will actually bring food and drinks to you if you end up sitting outside. 

I've only had an iced Americano - meh - and a green tea ice cream here, which was amazing, and hope to come back for a full and proper review of other selections."}
{"text":"I can say that the red curry was fantastic. Don't let the level of heat in the dishes were you, they seem a bit mild for their rating. However, the hot chili oil will sneak up on you.

My fiancé will attest that the pad Thai was very good. Our toddler enjoyed the fried dumplings and he can be rather finicky at times.

Overall excellent food excellent experience, except for some toddler antics. But that was the toddler and nothing to do with the restaurant."}
{"text":"Found this place while I was in town for business and was very pleased with place. 

Decir-very nice and elegant interior. Dark and romantic setting. Nice paintings for sale on wall and booths are comfortable. 

Service-waitress was amazing! She knew new menu very well and was very attentive to all my needs and offered great recommendations. 

Food-Very tasty and well prepared. If back in Charlotte soon, I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"We had the fried spring rolls, Bangkok Curry Soup, and Caramelized Pork stew. All of the food was delicious. The Bangkok Curry broth was amazing on the noodles and on jasmine rice. I highly recommend the cucumber concoction cocktail. Best service I've had in a long time. All of the staff were friendly and great at explaining dishes. Prices are very reasonable. Would highly recommend and can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Great food and service.  The Green Curry is excellent. The staff is very friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"Came here with my friends today. Waited for 1 hour for food to arrive only to find a strand of hair in it. They offered me free salad as a replacement. While I was eating my salad, the server informs me that they will charge me for it. I don't mind paying for food, but I was not expecting this kind of customer service from them. Not coming back."}
{"text":"I was in town for business and saw that this place served Lao, Thai, and Korean cuisine. Orlando does not have Lao Cuisine anywhere.
The food was excellent. I had Sukiyaki, Papaya Salad (lao style) with sticky, and the Kalbi. Our server was wonderful and the atmosphere of the place was great."}
{"text":"Nice lil vegan/ vegetarian crepes restaurant in Kensington market. It serves both sweet and savoury crepes. They serve mostly vegan with some exceptions of inclusion of dairy. Mention your food preferences and they make any dish on the menu vegan. They have vegan cheeses like mozzarella, Cheddar etc.
 
I visit them for their savoury selection of crepes, the   Cheddar pecan and pear crepe is my favourite, the chutney they add into it is awesome. I always ask for a hot sauce on the side, which not to be missed, its very similar to indian cilantro chutney.

They a decent selection of salads, i like the quinoa salad, the cracker they serve with sides are yummy!"}
{"text":"Fairly average food. Tried a couple different items and although the ideas behind the creations are good overall the flavors just didn't stand out. Not going to be a bad meal, but not worth going out of you way to try."}
{"text":"The small salad was quite filling and it tastes pretty good! I'm not vegan or vegetarian and I enjoyed the food here a lot. I wanted to get a crepe after the salad but we pretty full so I decided not to. The salad is more of a mixed bowl of quinoa and sides, the only greens are kale. Tastes amazing!"}
{"text":"Updated review as of 3/18/18:  The service and wait times have been really off lately.  I bring multiple people there and do call in orders all the time. 

Last night was really bad.  My husband called in pad Thai, crunchy dragon roll, and steamed dumplings.  We were driving back from my grandmothers so we were about 25 minutes away.  

We got to hibiscus and I had the car running and my husband was in there for 20 minutes and still didn't have any food.  I walked in and it was a big ordeal to get a refund (by now it had been an hour since we called it in).  The person just said sorry about that and we got a refund about 10 minutes later.  There was no offering to give us an appetizer to wait a little longer or explanation as to why we had to wait so long.  We would have understood when calling in if we were told it's going to be an hour and a half for to go orders.  We left without food.... 

I love the food here so it makes me sad that I can't rely on them for big parties or to go orders.  We have decided we will just go when it's not as likely to be crowded."}
{"text":"Beautiful place, although when we walked in there was an awful smell up front by the bar. Luckily we were seated towards the back so it didn't bother us. They have an extensive cocktail menu, which my boyfriend and I both ordered drinks from. After placing our drink and edamame order, our server came back to take our dinner order. Our drinks from the bar arrived after our dinner came out! Not sure if the bartender was hunting down the ingredients or what. Not a huge deal, but would have been nice to sip on while waiting for dinner. I ordered the pad thai at a level 4--- usually overconfident in my spice tolerance. It was delicious with both chicken and shrimp and very spicy! Make your nose water spicy! I enjoyed it but would probably go for a 3 next time. Huge portion, I ended up taking over half home. Boyfriend got the bibimbap and it was good too! Great place if you are looking for a more upscale Asian dinner. Looks like they have some pretty good lunch specials too!"}
{"text":"Excellent Food and even Better service!  We are from out of town but will definitely return when we are in Charlotte!"}
{"text":"Two (and a half) stars overall. Me and couple friends Went to this place and try duck crispy, soup, poke, bibimbap, bulgogi and chicken crisp. Overall dishes either bit too salty or just plain. Service was good though. May give another shot next time but for now 2 1/2 stars"}
{"text":"Vegan options are plentiful in Toronto and Hibiscus came highly recommended. 
I tried the crazy salad/soup combo with tons of ingredients and my wife had the crepe. 
Everything I had was delicious & the iced coffee was just ok. My wife wasn't crazy about the crepe though...kind of bland. Service was excellent."}
{"text":"Best crepe I ever had. It was busy so we had to wait but the banana walnut crepe for $10 was absolutely worth the wait. Premium experience for cheap."}
{"text":"The soup and salad combo can do you no wrong, I'm no vegetarian but this was amazing and surprisingly filling. The crepes were great too but the soup-salad combo is far better. The vegan ice cream (I got earl grey & pistachio which worked really well together) is served in huge portions and my 2 scoops were too much for me but I happily lapped it up. The servers are always genuine and pretty fast to boot!
The only downside is the seating as it does get filled pretty fast but it's a cute little place with cute decor and probably my favourite restaurant in Kensington Market --- no pretension, just amazing food."}
{"text":"Love this place! Always come here for brunch with friends.

If you are celiac and have gluten intolerance problem, their crepes either savory or sweet are awesome! My go to is the vegan crepe with pear it's filling and satisfying.

Most of the time when I come, I order the salad and soup combo!  Our order a few weeks ago took more than half hour.  Not sure why it took that long to throw a salad together but staff as always is super friendly! 

Vegan ice cream is good, my favorite is the lemon and green tea, the sea buckthorn is something I have never seen which was yummy.  I just REALLY wish they don't use conventional sugar and sweeteners."}
{"text":"Great portions, great prices, great customer service, music volume and type is just right. 

I got the soup and salad combo. I'm sensitive to ginger (which I could taste in the soup) but it was tasty to say the least! I also got the matcha latte, which is always my go to when I come across it! 

Will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Always incredible and consistent. I used to live in Toronto dor school and I miss this place so much."}
{"text":"Great place for anyone who is vegetarian or vegan, or just can't have dairy. Lots of options available. Not everything here is vegan. 

Their most popular item is probably the 42 ingredient salad. I had the smaller version for lunch and it was great for a smaller meal or a very light lunch. I wasn't hungry after but could still eat. Everything just blended really well together. It is also served with a cracker. This has to be the best vegan salad I have ever had. I wish I could recreate it! 

Service was okay. They get really full and there were no empty tables on a weekday at lunch. 

I will definitely be back to have more of that salad and to try some other options!"}
{"text":"The basil kai dao is my favorite. We've eaten in and done takeout a few times and the service is always fast. The servers are nice and the food is delicious. The chicken lettuce wraps are also delicious. Definitely worth a stop if you're in the area. Wish they didn't use styrofoam takeout containers, but that's a personal preference."}
{"text":"This place is soooooo meh. Sushi was supermarket quality. Bulgogi was mostly onions. Nothing on the menu is very creative."}
{"text":"Delicious entry in Charlotte's myriad of Asian/Thai restaurants.  Fried dumplings were so good. Tuna poke was fresh and flavorful. The pad see ew was also very good in taste and great portions size.  The waitstaff were also very nice and attentive.  Definitely worth a try if you enjoy thai."}
{"text":"They have the best basil chicken made with ground chicken. If you ask for it to be spicier than listed on the menu...be prepared!"}
{"text":"Love this place!! We always sit at the bar and the service is excellent. Food is great and cocktails are amazing as well...just an fyi...they are made from love and they take time to make...so don't get pissy when it takes 5 or so min to get to your table. I definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"Hibiscus is always good with tasty healthy vegetarian dishes and drinks. Right in the middle of Kensington market, it has a small patio which is nice to have lunch on And watch the sights of the market. Staff are friendly and enthusiastic. There aren't many seats so always go early."}
{"text":"I was quite pleased with the food here.
Everything was very fresh and tasty. I was very impressed when I asked for coffee sweetner options and was informed that maple syrup was an option! Very impressive! I opted for a dessert crepe and wasn't disappointed. This is a cute little joint and most won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Cute cozy cafe as most spots in Kensington are. Their menu is quite pricey but reasonable for the organic and vegan meals they offer. 

Their cup of soup was quite filling and worth the $4.50. Plus the raw cracker was delicious! Wish I had ordered another one. 

Their buckwheat crepes are good as well. Though I wish I had more pecans, I found it very filling as well. Not my favourite combination of flavours but was overall okay. 

I loved the atmosphere of the restaurant. I found that the servers were not very personable. Maybe it was what I ordered, but their food is not really my taste."}
{"text":"So sad that this place will not work. Wrong location and nothing different. Love thai food and thai taste is great but this location is not it. Been there a few times, but never busy (sad). CO across the street is hoppin but no one here when I go in. Tried to talk to manager about it and she said they are doing great. Hmmm, no one is in your restaurant! The bartender understood but he is leaving to Cali. (Smart guy and great bartender) Sad that no one else cares to listen to the people that has first hand experience of the situation. Good luck!"}
{"text":"Hands down one of the city's most deluxe little gems.

In addition to its lovely service, this is quality veg food set amongst the market buzz of Kensington. Have a munch and peruse the streets afterwards. if you want to.... 

The menu is just about as teensy as the space itself, as they serve up hearty grain bowls, soups, crepes, smoothies, and notable desserts. (TRY THE CHOCOLATE ALMOND BUTTER SQUARES)

It's sometimes tricky to get a seat, but sometimes not. I like to take the chance.

Well priced and its own, this is the cash nook to both read a book and have a lunch date.

I'd sure miss Hibiscus if it weren't around."}
{"text":"Went here while visiting friends in Charlotte. The food was delicious! First time we all visited and had a great time. I had the fried spring rolls as an appetizer and the Pad See Yew for dinner. Very yummy. Cocktails were good. The only thing weird was our waiter seemed pretty out of it. Mules were on special, so I ordered one and asked that it be made with Titos (1. A pretty common vodka mules are made with 2. Titos was used in several of their cocktails) and the waiter looked really confused and said, \"I don't know if we can do that.\" I was confused and asked \"Why not?\" And he was really frazzled and confused. I had to tell him Titos is a common vodka used for mules and that I know they have it. Seemed like something he should know. It was just a really strange interaction."}
{"text":"Great pad Thai! Probably the best you'll get around the park road shopping center. Decent portion too, can be shared with 2 people plus an appetizer"}
{"text":"Judging by the reviews, I think this place either disappoints or delivers depending on what you order.

DELIVERY REVIEW: via UberEATS

Savoury Crepe (vegan mozzarella, tomato, basil, spinach, mushroom)
- agree with other reviewers on the bland flavours of the savoury crepes
- the vegan cheese was rather displeasing and I think this crepe would've been better without it
- pretty pricy at $15
- the crepe itself was fine; the sweet crepes might be tastier considering it's easier to make a sweet vegan crepe using fruits vs a savoury one

Salad
- a mix of different legumes, quinoa, kale, nuts mixed together
- this was OK but I wouldn't eat again

Didn't particularly enjoy the items I ordered, but perhaps other items are better. I would give the sweet crepes which appear to have better reviews a chance next time."}
{"text":"Awesome service and delicious food! The sticky rice and green tea ice cream is amazing. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Tasty vegan restaurant. The bowl is their signature item. It's good. The raw cracker that they charge you an extra 75¢ for is terrible! I wish I knew it was extra so I could opt-out. 

The rest of it was tasty though. The soup reminds me of something I make at home (when I have the time... which is never anymore). The service is friendly.

A good place to get a fairly-priced veggie-filled lunch."}
{"text":"This is a welcome surprise here at park road shopping(park town village). I had the bebimbap...excellent! It came in a stone pot which kept everything hot and gave the rice a nice crunch.  Came with kimchee, pickled radish and a pickled whitefish. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Wow.. This place was delicious!! Great service, very friendly and attentive. 
The food was awesome! The fresh rolls were so good! We get those everywhere and these were some of the best! 
My wife got the grandma's bibimbap. (Rice,beef,egg..) I got the curry noodles with chicken, potatoes and carrots and it was so tasty!! I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Wow! Just had lunch here and ordered the 42 item salad and ginger squash soup and I am one happy customer! I had no idea vegan food could be quite so delicious and flavourful. Very cute little place and everything looked great. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I have been wanting to try this place for awhile because of the high reviews.  I was not as impressed as others have been.  It is a Korean-Thai fusion.  The restaurant is very up to date and stylish inside.  It's clean and the decor is great.  I was greeted by a very friendly hostess and the service was good.  My server had only been there for three days, so wasn't overly familiar with the menu, but that was ok.

The Tom Kha Gai soup was not my favorite.  I think the flavor of lemongrass is what kind of threw me off.  The coconut tasted good, though.  I ordered Pad Kee Mao (drunken noodles) and was disappointed with the lack of noodles.  The flavor was pretty tasty, but I would've loved to have enough noodles.  I also had a side of kimchi, which was good.  Their hot sauce and chili sauce was disappointing.  They were not hot/spicy at all compared to what I'm used to.  The flavor was kind of weird as well.  I asked for my noodles to be a 4 (from 1-5 spicy level) and it was NOT at all.  No hint of spice.  

The place is a good idea..the mango sticky rice was awesome....the decor is beautiful...people are friendly.  I think I'm just used to maybe more authentic, spicy food? I don't know.  But a lot of people like it here and I'm not knocking it, just not my personal favorite."}
{"text":"After a day of much medical query and blood extraction I fled the scariness of hospital row and darted for the safety of Kensington.

Thanks to Yelp and my recent efforts to try and eat sensibly albeit deliciously, I was lured to the quaint confines of this exotic little flower of a cafe called Hibiscus.

It is an adorable little nook of a place, and makes you feel like you're hanging out in your cool vegan/gluten-free friendly Japanese (which I think the owner's are) exchange student friend's kitchen. The service of course is uber-pleasant and expedient as I have the menu explained to me by the really polite staff. 

 I decide to order the vegan buckwheat crepe which is brimming with mushrooms lovely fanned tomatoes and yummy vegan cheddar.  The crepe shell itself is very flavourful as I detect a herby pesto-basil textured ness about it not to mention it's sheer heft!   Yes this crepe is $9, but I still had to doggy-bag it as it was mammothly delicious! Yay leftovers,
I love-em!!!

 I was a little perturbed that it was excruciatingly hot inside, which is no fault of Hibiscus, as this is Kensington, where air-con is indeed a rarity.  But still that did not take away from my satiety, even though I was a nearly bloodless creature upon arrival, I felt like my life force/manna was fully replenished without a hint of meat...wow!

Next time you're in Kensington and feel the urge for something other than Chinese or Mexican (Chexican?) 
Get your veganese on at Hibiscus...it's blooming great!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I wanted to try out some Korean food and what we found was wonderful. The atmosphere of Hibiscus is really upscale and classy. The menu is simple but has lots of adventurous things all at a reasonable price. We got the chicken skewers, spring rolls, and bibimbap with mango and sticky rice for dessert (I know it is really Thai). Everything was super yummy and fresh. Great comfort food! This would make a nice place for a classy date night or just a yummy dinner with friends."}
{"text":"I decided to check out Hibiscus after receiving a PM for my review for Urban Herbivore. This place is definitely very different from UH as they have a set menu for their salads, crepes etc. As per Yelp's reviews, I went with the salad and soup combo and enjoyed it.

The soup of the day was Ginger and Squash while the house was their standard house salad with a side of raw cracker. To be honest it is a toss up between the two restaurants.

If I was craving a salad, I'd be heading to UH as their portions are bigger but more importantly, you get to choose what you want in it.

If I was craving healthier options (aka not salad) for my lunch hour, Hibiscus will be the place to be!"}
{"text":"With my recent adventures into all things vegetables, Hibiscus seemed like a great spot for me to try another salad in Toronto.  I've seen the rave reviews from their Kensington location and so their Assembly spot seemed perfect.  Im not sure what happened but compared to my recent salads from The Goods, Fresh, K&K, and Veghed, this one wasn't in the same category.

There are a lot of great things about Hibiscus aside from being in the great Assembly Chef Hall.  I wrote a whole novel on how great the concept and atmosphere is.  With Hibiscus, its sits on the upper level with a nice open space and it's not in the crowded smaller hallway.  Service here is very friendly and nice.  Their counter and area is spotless.  

Their menu has a lot of good variety... everything from savoury crepes, their famed 42 ingredient salad, to desserts like vegan ice cream and crepes.  They also have several bars and other baked treats that sounded incredibly tempting.  For me, it was easy to decide on a salad with 42 ingredients.  

42 ingredient salad - I like this salad because it has so many wonderful ingredients and the texture is great... crispy pieces here, crunch there, and chew bites in between.  Visually its really wonderful.  Taste wise... it was like eating undressed vegetables.  It felt like it wasn't seasoned or closely dressed.  There was no acidity, savoury herbs, or any vibrant spices.  I love a great salad with as many ingredients as you can throw into it but I also need it to have a flavour that brings it all together.  Still admire it for the sheer volume of vegetables though.  3.5/5

Cashew and cranberry bar - It's a very flavourful baked good but its quite dense like a nut butter. It makes sense since there are just wonderful giant gobs of the nutt butters in this.  There are the occasional dried cranberry to break up the nut butter and gooey dense cookie base.  I wouldnt say this is brownie chewy but rather buttery dense.  Either way, a great sweet snack. 4/5

I'd definitely come back to try their ice cream or their soup but maybe I'll hold off on their salads unless I'm on some sort of vegan bend.  Even then, I'd still need a good kick of flavour on my vegetables."}
{"text":"Not a vegan or a gluten-free person here, but a true omnivore who will obviously go where the food is good, and it is good here.

The Salad Bowl - a composed salad of about ten different salads put in one big bowl, served with a wonderful crispy appley cracker.  The best and most filling salad I have had in forever.  I'm going to have this again.  Often.
Chutney and Cheese buckwheat crepes - so. Tasty.  My husband ordered these with a side salad and he let me eat some.  I am going to get this next time for myself because dang.  Cheese and soba and chutney... what could be better?

They were out of leek and potato soup when we got there (about an hour before closing time) which was somewhat sad, but we made up for it by getting two peanut-buttery squares to eat later.  This was an exceedingly reasonable meal - Giant salad, crepes, side salad, lemonade, and 2 squares came to $31 before tip.  And we were full for a good long time after.  Definitely a place to revisit. =)"}
{"text":"I tried the basil, tomato,mushroom and spinach crepe, along with vegan dark chocolate and banana and hazelnut crepe, earl grey ice cream, and butternut squash soup and salad special. 

Everything was just delicious and not to mention nutritious! The crepe was STUFFED with fresh ingredients. The portion was very big. (9$ tax inc.) The sweet crepe was good, but my only concern is that it was very rich due to the overwhelming amount of chocolatey goodness. I personally didn't like the hazelnuts, it was sort of an extra topping. The earl grey ice cream was yummy too, but it had a sandy texture to it. I'm neutral towards it. The flavour of the earl grey was light and refreshing. AND finally, the closing act. The soup was not fully smoothe, but with some chunks of squash (which is what I like). It was full of flavour and colour. As for the salad, just absolutely amazing. HEALTHY and just full of different flavours/textures. In the salad, there's beets,tofu,long beans, squash, quinoa, beans, broccoli, tomatoes, fake cheese and to compliment it all, a sunflower,apple & other stuff cracker. Overall, everything is absolutely lovely!"}
{"text":"Went alone for a quick pre-classes lunch. Soup and salad combo and green tea ice cream. Total was $11 something. I was really full and satisfied. Nice little cafe setting, probably the brightest store/restaurant in Kensington. Will return :( and remember to tip the next time too.

Service:
Best service in Kensington Market. Courteous, quick and friendly. At the end of my meal, as I was paying, I asked the man at the register a question. Even though I interrupted him (rude, I know!), he still calmly explained to me that the \"milk\" used in the ice cream depends on the flavour.

Food:
Organic Butternut Squash Soup - I wish the serving was bigger so I could just dunk my whole face in. But when paired with the salad, it's perfectly filling. And delicious. And creamy. And orange, who doesn't like orange?

Salad Bowl - I asked them if they could please not put any tofu in it, and instead of just saying yes :O they took into consideration that I might've meant soy. And I did, and they did not put any soy produce into my salad bowl. The textures were just so great, the quinoa was lightly minty and the cranberry added a sweet chewy bite. Broccolli and green beans shared the same flavour and were crisp. Carrot slaw? was really delicious. The chickpea and pulses were also very good and meaty.

Bonus: that nice little cracker thing is nice - sweet and nutty and manages to be both chewy and crispy.

Green Tea Icecream - CREAMMMMMMMMMMY, served in a cute little bowl with a cute little wooden spoon."}
{"text":"Food is simple, BUT delicious!
Best bang for my buck in awhile.
Also excellent service."}
{"text":"After a horrible visit at another Kensington vegan establishment, Hibiscus managed to exceed my expectations. Portions are smaller here, but I ate every enjoyable bite of my 'salad & soup' combo without any waste (I hate waste!) and I felt satisfied after my meal; I'm a omnivore, by the way, so being in a vegan environment unfortunately doesn't always sate me, needless to say, I'm impressed. Service was great, never hurried me & my good friend who had lunch there to catch up, but we didn't sit too long, as there were plenty of others waiting to be seated (have to be considerate of my neighbours). Ambience was nice, fresh, clean and cool...a great place to enjoy a healthy meal :)"}
{"text":"A solid 4.5 stars so I'm gonna round up to a 5. I ran into this spot for a quick lunch to go. Roger greeted me and took my order. He was super friendly and the food was brought out within five minutes. It was fresh and hot. I ordered the shrimp pad Thai lunch special and it came with five huge shrimp, pad thai, edamame, and a spring roll. It was a perfect lunch and it was a fair price ($11). I would definitely recommend it."}
{"text":"There are only two good vegan hard ice cream places in the city and Hibiscus is one of them. I'm tired of eating overly sweet gelato or soft serve and Hibiscus never disappoints with their complex hard scoop flavours. 

I recently had their strawberry basil and their lemon mint. Both incredible!! 

They use different bases like almond milk, coconut milk or mung beans."}
{"text":"Been here twice, and both times it was pretty much full!

Their 42 ingredient salad is hands down the best salad I've ever had. Their savoury crepes, while tasty, are a bit coarser than what you'd traditionally expect from a crepe. Nonetheless, delicious and full of health!

They seem to be thinly staffed so service was a bit slow, but definitely worth the wait!"}
{"text":"Good food, good service. Green curry was yummy. Bimbimbap was just okay. A lot of stuff in the menu that looked good so we'll likely be back to try more."}
{"text":"I spent basically an hour walking to this place only to find that it was closed on a Thursday at 4:30 pm I was pretty disappointed and couldn't figure out why that was, as there was no sign or anything and i believe they are normally open later :("}
{"text":"We only tried the sweet crepes here but I wasn't a fan.

They weren't terrible but a bit bland and not exciting. Tasted like something I could have made at home without much effort. 

We tried the dulce de leche and kiwi, cinnamon apple and the nutella. All of us had the same reaction - 'meh'

I like that all the toppings are vegan ('dulce de leche' and the 'nutella') and that the crepes were gf but for the price I doubt I will order the sweet crepes again. Maybe I will return to try the savory items on the menu though just bc it is v difficult to find gf and vegan eateries. Interested in trying their salad as have heard great things about it. 

Service was also meh. Not overly friendly but I guess they were attentive enough."}
{"text":"We found a Groupon for this place so we decided to check it out. We got there right when they opened because we like to eat early. There was no one there yet. 

They have half price appetizers during the week from 4-6, so we started with the chicken skewers. They were so good. The chicken was cooked really well. It was moist and had a lot of flavor. It came with a delicious peanut sauce. 

For our entrees, we got the fresh ginger an the cashew nut from the wok. They were both really good, but we both liked the cashew nut one more. The sauce had more favor and was really good. We got level 3 of spice and it had a good amount of heat to it. 

We got our food really fast which could just be because there was no one there. Our waiter was attentive at first, but then my water sat empty for a while and we had to wait a while when we were done to ask for the check. 

I also really liked the decor. It was dimly lit and had really cool light fixtures. 

This makes the list of best Thai restaurants in Charlotte. I would come here again and recommend others to as well!"}
{"text":"Operated by the same owners as Thai taste. Hibiscus seems to be a similar restaurant with some Korean flare and a bit more elevated than Thai taste.

We came one night with friends for a double date. Our server was so kind and very helpful in explaining the menu.

My husband and I recently travelled to Thailand, so we have been in search of similar flavors. We started with the papaya salad. This is a staple in Thailand and we were excited to try it. It was excellent, but way too spicy. We only ordered a level III spice, but the papaya must've absorbed more than other dishes.

My husband ordered the pad Thai and he was very happy with this. I ordered green curry at a level four spice, and it was delicious. I even had some to take home with me. This, surprisingly, was not as spicy as I expected.

I was able to finish the meal with mango sticky rice, which I was so excited about. I believe the serving on this was small for the price.


We did have an appetizer, two entrées, and dessert, but I did feel like things were a bit expensive. Drinks were good as well and I was pretty happy with my cocktails.

If anything, I will be back for the curry and the nice service. Price for the curry seems to be consistent with other restaurants in town."}
{"text":"Just opened recently, and not going anywhere.  

Food and service are on point.  Sat outside in the common area since we had great weather, so made it even better. 

- Lettuce wraps w/ Chicken - very good, nice crunch from the noodles.  
- Basil chicken - we ordered spicy, good definitely go Thai hot, but the spicy condiments gave us the extra heat we needed. 
- Lobster in green curry was also very good. Have them chop up the lobster after they bring it out, if it's too much work at the table. 
- Egg fried rice, dumplings, Pad Se Ew were also very good.  

- Our servers were phenomenal."}
{"text":"The most amazing salad! I love how there are so many different savoury components in there. I work closeby and will definitely be back. Next time, will try to visit at a less busy hour. It was primetime Sunday at noon, so the wait was a bit long. I originally wanted to order the crepes, which would have taken 30 minutes, but I am glad I tried the salad + soup combo!"}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place! I've been going here for 10 years and it's always been one of my favour its restaurants in Toronto. The salad is fantastic and definitely my favourite  item on the menu. Whether you're vegan or not, you should give this place a try- you won't be disappointed"}
{"text":"Had the opportunity to stop by Hibiscus for dinner.  Ambience was good, comfortable seats and the food had good flavor.  I was just very disappointed with the food you see pictured. Although the flavor was good it is not Korean Bulgogi as they advertise it.  Bulgogi is all meat, and this that you see her is a noodle dish which by the way is served with rice, so double the carbs lol. The korean side dishes were watered down for some reason watered down.  Just a little perplexed, but overall it was good. If there is a next time I will just ask the waiter for specifics on the dish."}
{"text":"It was love at first bite at this cozy vegetarian cafe in Kensington Market.   We were en route to Urban Herbivore for lunch when we caught a glimpse of Hibiscus Cafe.  Little did I know that I would be praising them in my next review as another \"hidden gem\".   It has all the right ingredients to be classified as such.  It's inexpensive and healthy, yet completely satisfying.  Plus the smiling staff  make the experience that much more enjoyable.      

Note: They are only open until 7pm on weeknights.  Someone should tell them that these hours might work in the suburbs, where 9 to 5 jobs still exist.  Dinner time is usually 8pm in my world.   So Hibiscus will be a weekend destination for now.

The vegetarian and gluten-free menu is simple yet delivers variety (there are a few vegan options as well).   It consists of soup, salad, crepes and smoothies.  The variety comes through in their buckwheat (gluten-free) crepe fillings - I believe there are 15 to choose from.  They also have a dessert menu which caters to poor souls like myself, who are deprived of sweets due to diet restrictions.   You can make up for that deprivation here and then some.     

OUR ORDER:   Surprises are great when it comes to birthday presents, but not when it comes to food.  I prefer to know what I'm getting before I order it.   This is not an issue at Hibiscus.  The space is so small that you can sneak a peek at most of the menu items landing on the tables around you (or reach over and snag food off their plate when they turn the other way).  We may have creeped out our neighbours peering over their shoulders, but ordering was stress-free!    

Salad Bowl ($7) -  Ordering the same menu item as my 'dining partner' is a pet peeve of mine.  I love being able to try my 'partners' dish (and vice versa, if necessary) but I ignored that rule at Hibiscus.  Here's why.  The woman beside us had been served her mixed salad and we couldn't take our eyes off it.  It was a grazers dream.   When we think salad we typically envision green leaf and tomato.  BOR-ING.  These guys have taken the term salad to a new level and I couldn't be happier about it.  It contains NO lettuce at all.  How refreshing!   Green beans, sesame pate, legumes, tofu, asparagus, quinoa, beets, squash.   The perfect blend of flavours, textures, nutrients (fats, carbs and proteins) in one bowl.  They've set a new standard for salad.  
   

Buckwheat Crepe ($9) -  I have a thing for crepes so I was still extremely anxious to taste their healthier take on it.   It might have been all the pent up excitement, or my familiarity with the typical chocolate-smothered dessert crepe, but this savoury version didn't live up to expectations.   It was stuffed with warm spinach, mushroom, tomatoes and basil lending a fresh \"out of the garden\" taste, without the dirt.   With most bites, the basil was the overpowering flavour.  It may have have been better  balanced with a dose of cheese or some type of spread.  From my point of view, cheese goes hand-in-hand with crepes and it was the missing link.  But this was no fault of Hibiscus.  I had requested the dairy-free version.  Overall it was good but gets no gold star, especially for $9.  The star goes to their salad.  Plus it gets extra points for being $2 less!  Call me frugal, but I know a good deal when I see one!"}
{"text":"Really delicious food. The decor was super cute and clean looking. Fresh flowers on the table were a nice touch. 

We ordered the fried dumplings. They were good just not what we expected. Instead of your typical pan fried they were definitely feel fried in a flower dough shape. The filling was chicken and water chestnut and it was very tasty.

I ordered the Bangkok curry noodle soup and the flavor was incredible! Peanuty, a little spice, and delicious. My only issue was the noodles were definitely overlooked and mushy. They were also egg noodles and I feel like with the dish rice rifles would have been nice. 

My husband ordered the bibimbap and it was very good but basically your typical bibimbap. The sides were fish cake, pickled cucumbers, and kimchi. The cucumbers were the star in my opinion and the kimchi was refreshing as well. 

Overall very good pleasant evening!"}
{"text":"Great fine. So much better than I expected. Had the duck salad and soft shell crab. Very tasty. Had the flammable sushi, not as good as other dishes."}
{"text":"Tried this beautiful little place today and really loved it.  My mom had a savoury crepe, and I tried the famous 42 ingredient salad + soup combo.

Everything was fresh and beautifully presented. Friendly staff and cozy atmosphere. Will definitely make this a regular lunch spot!"}
{"text":"I didn't have high expectations when we came to dinner here, but we really enjoyed it. The server was very attentive. We ordered the curry soup with chicken, noodles, carrots, potatoes, etc. and they split it in two bowls for us. There was a ton of it and it was absolutely delicious! I'm not a big soup fan, but this was outstanding. We also had the dish in the big pot that crisps up the rice and has an egg, like in other reviewers photos. It was great! I had no spice so it is up to you to add to it. There is a red sauce that looks like ketchup that we enjoyed. I can't handle much spice, but I liked it mixed in my rice. The soup isn't too spicy either, but they give you things to spice it up with. The vegetable rolls were also great. I liked the sweet sauce with peanuts that came with rolls and she brought me more to mix with my rice and the spicy red sauce. We each had a cocktail and the total bill was $57. We didn't think that was bad at all for two entrees, app, and two cocktails. Def a hidden gem!"}
{"text":"Excellent service and quality recipes! Had the Sukiyaki hot pot!! Kibo sake was on point!"}
{"text":"As an avid Thai lover, I was excited to try this place out based on its good reviews. It did not disappoint, the decor is beautiful, great service and the food was delicious and quick to arrive. We had the fresh rolls which were exactly that - very fresh with tasty sauces. We had the pad Thai and Kai Boa and both were full of flavor with a large portion sizes. I have been going to Thai Basil weekly since 2012, and hibiscus may have just converted me!"}
{"text":"The soup and salad special is up to $8.83 (with tax).  Since it was really the only thing I reviewed, that brings my review down to a 3, but a solid 3."}
{"text":"Terrible. Why do people think vegan food must also be completely tasteless? There wasn't even salt in any of the dishes we ordered. Everything was flavorless and mushy. I couldn't even eat my salad. How the hell do you mess up a salad?"}
{"text":"Best Thai food we've had in Charlotte, very fresh vegetables and sushi. Drinks we're unique and you could tell a lot of thought went into them. Bartender was very friendly and helpful!"}
{"text":"The 40+ ingredient salad is health in a bowl. It is so very filling and delicious that even non vegetarians will be left satisfied. The soup in a cup is a great accompaniment to the salad but is not necessary as the salad is full of filling ingredients - too many to name. The atmosphere matches the Kensington vibe with a boho decorative feel.  The service was wonderful with attentive and available staff to fulfill your hippie desires."}
{"text":"Great spot in Kensington. By far the best spot f you're looking for something healthy

The service is really good and the salad is full of flavour and at a great price. A must for anyone who wants a healthy kick."}
{"text":"We ordered a variety of things.  Their Kao Piek sen was a little chewy and the thom kem tasted more like Filipino adobo.  We also ordered red curry which was delicious and their papaya salad was pretty authentic.  Their service was excellent (very important)."}
{"text":"Checked out this cute little place on Kensington market.  

I had vegan crepes while my friend had their salad and their gelato. Quite delish and love that it's vegan.

Their ice cream is light which I like.  Their salad was pretty colorful. Loved it."}
{"text":"Limited seating, nice outdoor section, VERY slow service, quality ingredients but overpriced. 

Located at a busy and quaint spot in Kensington market, it's tempting to eat here especially on a pedestrian Sunday. The crepes are apparently what this place is known for but our crepe took 30 minutes to make and taste wise, it was quite subpar and it costed $15! We got the pear savoury one and it was very... interesting, not the most appetizing dish for sure. 

The salads here though are bomb. We also got the salad and soup combo and both were delicious. The salad has a variety of quality and fresh ingredients including kale, rice noodles, carrots, quinoa, squash, nuts and tofu. The soup was butternut squash with a splash of curry flavour and served in a cup. 

All in all, I would visit just for the salad and the hip vibes but for pure taste, there's plenty of other restaurants near by."}
{"text":"The food is not terrible, but not amazing either. Cute little place, but not my favourite restaurant in the Kensington market area.

If you're into vegetarian food, it's not a bad option."}
{"text":"Good get some good Thai food.  I only did a take out order, but the place is very well put together.  Also getting my take out was extremely fast. 
From placing my order to me walking out the door was around 5 mins.  Everything was cook to order.
Worth stopping by and looking at the menu"}
{"text":"YELP fail. We used Yelp to decide between Hibiscus and Bonchon next door. I can't believe what a let down this was. The service was awkward and the food wasn't good. We went for an early dinner and it wasn't crowded. The fried dumplings were okay, but the Thai and sushi just didn't taste fresh or have good flavor. Will not go back."}
{"text":"Came here on a whim as I was searching Kensington Market/Chinatown area for cheap but good eats. Going on fellow Yelper reviews, I got the soup and salad combo (mildly apprehensive because it doesn't sound like it will fill my endless appetite). Boy was I in for a surprise! I'm glad the review that convinced me to come here didn't reveal all of the ingredients because when it came out, I was pleasantly shocked. The colours alone made the meal appetizing. Moreover, the ginger butternut squash soup was and has always been a favourite of mine. I came back three times within the week of my first visit all the while raving about it to my friends. 

Lovely staff, great food, super affordable prices and the ice cream? *heart melts"}
{"text":"I ordered three entrees using the online menu and got an estimate that they would be ready in 45 minutes. Okay, so I timed my arrival to be there at 45 minutes. The orders took about 25 minutes longer than that. Ouch. So keep that in mind if you're getting some takeout.

The dinners were excellent. The curry with chicken was tasty and nicely flavorful. Lots of vegetables and lots of chicken. Just really, really good. Caramelized Pork Stew was also very good with nice pieces of pork and crispy vegetables.

I enjoyed the meals and they went over quite well. Just be patient with the timing."}
{"text":"Do you like fresh, yummy crepes? If you're vegan, you probably don't get to enjoy them that often at restaurants, but Hibiscus in Kensington Market makes sure you're not left out at the party. With fifteen filling combinations that include fresh, seasonal fruit like kiwi and strawberries you really can't go wrong. At lunchtime the order process was a snap but the subsequent table service was unfortunately slow.

I ordered the plain vanilla and cinnamon crepe, which came adorned with strawberries, kiwi and thinly sliced gala apples. The crepe was dusted with a light sprinkling of cinnamon and nutmeg. It was just the perfect amount of food for a nice snack-sized lunch.

Hibiscus also sells veg-friendly magazines that you can borrow to read while you dine inside. Charmed, I'm sure."}
{"text":"I ordered delivery via UberEats and tried the sushi burrito and fresh veggie rolls

The sushi burrito was delicious! It didn't fall apart and there was perfect amounts of all the ingredients! You get the option to choose a protein- salmon, tuna or tempura shrimp. I had the tempura shrimp and it was perfectly crunchy. Also inside was crab salad (probably imitation but still tasty), lettuce, asparagus and cucumber. They even included a perfect cup of spicy mayo and eel sauce for dipping! It wasn't the biggest burrito I've ever seen but it was delicious and held together well. 

The fresh veggie roll appetizer was tasty and very fresh. Lots of sliced veggies with a good crunch. They included 2 different dipping sauces - I liked both! 

I'd definitely go in person or order deliver again!"}
{"text":"Food is delicious for the most part, but the service could be much better. I've been here several times and I've fallen in love with their green curry and hibiscus crunch roll. The atmosphere is nice and quaint and would be perfect for a date night, however, I suggest ordering takeout."}
{"text":"Great food! Best lettuce wraps I have ever had. Flavor was deliciously Server was so helpful. Check out this new spot. Oh, and a full bar!"}
{"text":"Been coming here for years, and have now introduced some other friends to it.  Their positive reactions proves that Hibiscus is still on the right track.

I looove their mixed salad + soup combo.  Perfect in any of our 4 seasons.
I love this combo so much, I usually don't stray from ordering the same thing, over and over...  I can't find anything like this meal, anywhere else.
Green beans, tofu, carrots with dressing, lentils, beets, sweet potatoes... you can request whichever ones you wish.  They have about 7-8 to choose from.  The soups are usually one that's sweet potato/squash-based, or one that has a beet/tomato-y base.  I like them both, but my friends didn't love the beety soup so much.  Said it tasted like beets, go figure.

Under $10, and you'll maybe leave feeling comfortably full - but definitely you'll leave feeling guilt-free.

Service was fab, btw.  Genuine and gentle humble service, with a smile.

If you have a sweet tooth, there will be many gluten-free, and spelty baked goods to choose from.  One of my fave items is the peanut or almond butter (semi-crispy) rice squares."}
{"text":"Got the lunch (?) special today. A salad (with a cracker on the side) and a squash soup in a mug.

The salad was wonderful. It had every vegetarian goodie known to man including a whack load of fresh veggies, legumes, and quinoa. The portion size was perfect. I was full by the end of the meal (it was quite hearty). It was served with a delicious (homemade?) cracker on the size. Soooooo good. The soup came in a mug and it was good, what you would expect from a typical squash soup.

The bill came to just under $10 per person which is EXTREMELY good for what you get. 

The only thing I would improve is probably a larger menu? It was mostly salads, soups, crepes (sweet or savoury), and desserts.

Definitely one of the best veggie restaurants in Toronto. We were so impressed that later in the day we were considering coming back for dinner!"}
{"text":"Great new addition to the neighborhood. I received amazing service and the food was authentic and great quality. I sat at the bar with a friend and can tell you that the cocktails are handmade, with each piece of fresh fruit being sliced on the spot (not pre-sliced) and muddled with care. This is a very difficult location for a restaurant to thrive, as countless other owners can attest to. However, I think Hibiscus' service, quality, and décor upgrades give it a great shot."}
{"text":"Delicious and super filling soup and salad, creeps are great too. Only down side is that they don't make conversation and they take a really long time to make the crepes"}
{"text":"Came here with some friends to check it out. My husband and I had the tom kha soup, lettuce wraps, and pad Thai. Everything was delicious. My friends had the bimbimbap and bulgogi and said both items were great. Only thing is that it seems a little pricier than most Thai/Korean, just a heads up."}
{"text":"Holy wow. I didn't know what to expect here, I had just seen a picture of some Bibimbap and it made me hungry. 

Let's break it down: 

1) the place looks gorgeous. so much attention to detail from wallpaper, to mirrors, light fixtures, etc. 

2) the staff - everyone I talked to was so friendly! They were remarkably sincere and knowledgable about the menu. Great smiles. 

3) the food!! - I wish I had 2 stomachs. I ordered the Bibimbap in a stone pot. Sooo good!! The egg, sauces, side plates. It was traditional, and so delicious. 

I can't wait to go back and try the entire menu :)"}
{"text":"My food was amazing! I had a delicious curry soup that I enjoyed with freshly steamed tofu. They really take care of vegetarians here and I love that! You can add whatever you want with steamed or fried tofu which is fabulous, as well as they add in some delicious veggies on top of this! Expansive menu with lots of fresh tofu and lots of delicious options- my friend and I had a hard time deciding! We were excited that the food came so quickly and are excited to come back to try more of the sushi and other fair!"}
{"text":"I'm a huge fan of Hibiscus!!! whenever I'm craving a nice fresh hardy salad and delicious soup on my lunch break this place is what calls my name. They also have some great vegan crepes which I have tried a few times but I still keep going back to their awesome soup and salad combo which is perfection in my eyes.

This place is a great find in Kensington Market"}
{"text":"THEY HAVE SUSHI BURRITOS. And boy are they good. Super fresh! Not a large place, so recommend making reservations at peak times. Will be back."}
{"text":"Mediocre food, expensive price."}
{"text":"Moved here a year ago and was so disappointed in the lack of good Thai food in the South Park area. I'm so happy this place opened up! So far I have tried the pad thai, chicken curry, chicken lettuce wraps, and the bibimbap. Delicious!"}
{"text":"Great vibe. Very relaxed and friendly service. The sides that came with the entrees were fresh and delicious. The servings were plentiful but lacked a little flavor, however the overall presentation was appetizing and excellent. The menu was more of a hybrid of mostly Korean and some Thai. I will be going back and highly recommend this chill spot for  a date night or even just meeting an old friend."}
{"text":"I came in here expecting something pretty good based on the other reviews but what i got really blew my mind. 

The food was delicious! Everything was on point. I had the mozzarella, tomato, basil, spinach, mushroom crepe and my friend had the soup and salad combo.

I was very surprised at how balanced and flavourful the crepe was. there weren't any fancy ingredients just regular stuff done right. I'm not a vegan or even a vegetarian but I when I ate this I felt like I could give up meat and eat this everyday!  

The soup of the day was squash with a hint of ginger and was great for warming up in the cold.

The salad was the strangest mix of stuff I've ever seen. My friend has been a vegetarian for 4 years and she couldn't make out all the ingredients! Whatever it's food and I've put weirder things in my mouth. Down the hatch and mmmmmmm it also tastes amazing. 

They were very generous with portion sizes and I felt myself getting full and I'm a big eater.  

The staff was very nice and helpful and didn't rush us after it was past closing time. They also helped us choose our flavour of ice cream for desert which were all tasty too.

Pricing was great too since eating out usually puts a dent in my student salary wallet  but this places actually understands that I'm not made of money. 

Overall this place is a something that is a must try even if you're not a vegan or vegetarian. You won't regret it!"}
{"text":"Best plant-based salad ever. Period. Worth it for lunch and dinner and any other meal of the day. I would come back to Toronto just to eat this salad.

Lovely customer service. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Lao style papaya salad extra spicy is the way to go. A little on the pricey side. $10 for papaya salad?! And other menu items seem to be above. Good thing that's all I wanted. Though it is a cute place and was a little upscaled. 
Walked in and no host/hostess around to greet or seat us. Took a few then the bar guy finally came out and sat us."}
