{"text":"Huge disappointment in the change made to the carrot cake! It was my go to dessert. It was a generous slice of moist and carrot filled/flavored goodness, with frosting that has just the right sweeteness.

Now, it's the same recipe, just in a tube shape instead of a slice.  They reduced the amount of cake, by what seems like half, with the same amount of frosting as before.  A few bites and it was gone, with frosting left on the plate."}
{"text":"Their chicken salad sandwich was great, also when they have made a fresh batch or orange rolls there's nothing better! Everyone must try their orange rolls!"}
{"text":"Love their bread, soups and obsessed with their BLT. Haven't tried other sandwiches bc I love the blt too much. It's expensive, but it's also high quality. Would suggest a punch card or something to reward loyal customers. So thankful they have drive thru- crucial with kids."}
{"text":"I went to take a drive with my granddaughter and dog this morning to get breakfast.  I pulled into Kneaders placed my order and pulled up to pay.  Unfortunately I had a huge problem I left my wallet at home and had no cash!  Kellen who took care of me at the window was the kindest man.  He told me no you can come back and pay or just call a card in when you get home.  \"You've got to have your breakfast!\"  Wow!  Kneaders I'm blown away by the kindness displayed.  Kellen gave me his card took my first name and that was it.  Someone like this gives me faith in humanity.  Thank you Kellen you have a customer for life.  Oh and of course my breakfast was delicious as always!"}
{"text":"I ordered almond croissant and this Thing is so delicious! The store also offered some bread samples and they are all very good. Coffee -wise I don't know much. However, my $4 bucks got me a pastry and a iced coffee in kneaders while only a iced tea lemonade in Starbucks. The space is more open and people are more friendly here. I wasn't very hungry this morning otherwise the all you can eat French toast seems really good to me. I am looking forward for a weekend brunch here. If any complaints, the wifi is not very good. Only certain spot has good signals."}
{"text":"I love kneaders, healthy and fresh at fast food prices and speed! Best value and great food can't beat it!"}
{"text":"I just recently moved to AZ and my boyfriend and I decided to try Kneaders. We had a wonderful experience thanks to Magdalena's amazing customer service. She is the reason we will definitely be returning :)"}
{"text":"Delightful bakery and cafe! My visit was at 10:45 am, Wednesday, and there was actually a bit of a line to order.  Similar to Paradise where you order at the counter and they deliver the food to your table.  The line went quickly.  The service was quite friendly.  Bustling and happy atmosphere.  The breakfast sandwich was larger than expected, hot, fresh and delicious!  The prices are quite reasonable.  They serve all you can eat French Toast all day.  It looks delicious and I plan to try it soon."}
{"text":"love their dessrts. The owner is very nice. We go here way too often! The cookies with a cop event was particularly fun and I love how active in the community they are!"}
{"text":"I love this location! The girl helping us was super sweet and knowledgable;it was great customer service. Amazing soups and I love their Berry 5 smoothie. Highly recommend because I am picky about soups and smoothies but this place has won my heart and tummy. The bread bowls are super good too although I'm not a huge fan of sour dough."}
{"text":"I normally go to the kneaders at the San Tan marketplace and we love their delicious salads and soups. The Alma School location though is quite a disappointment. We ordered two full size salads there today. My favorite turkey feta and a new one my husband tried called Southwest Bbq chicken. I was dismayed to see how little meat was on each salad. I estimate it was half of what I usually get at the other location. So the three stars are because it still tasted good, but I docked them 2 stars for the stingy portions. I wish I had thought to take a picture before I was half way through the salad and eating just lettuce."}
{"text":"The food is very good and I especially enjoy breakfast. Today I ordered the \"all you can eat\" French toast. After I finished I decided to request another order and try pancakes this time. After waiting more than 20 minutes I finally gave up and left. Unfortunate, as they have good food but service says a lot."}
{"text":"I went into Kneaders looking for healthy options and was thoroughly impressed. I ordered the Turkey Cranberry salad. I even made a last minute change and they happily accepted it. I was impressed with the quality of both the salad and turkey. I won't hesitate to return."}
{"text":"Excellent desserts. Amazing paninis especially the chocolate brownies. We would recommend it to anyone for a great daily lunch."}
{"text":"I have tried this location 4 times to give them a chance and 3 out of the 4 times my sandwich was mostly bread with very little meat.  On my 3rd visit I politely called to inform them with out being upset being a small businesses owner myself I would've appreciated the same respect to fix it.  I didn't want anything free or in return, I just wanted to have a new place in our rotation that my family and I could visit on a regular work week. We were excited to see Kneaders open in our neighborhood but, not so much anymore.  For the cost of the sandwiches and the skimping of the meat it wasn't worth it! I ordered the Turkey Cranberry Croissant 4 times, and the same result every time.  Sad to say they've lost a family as customers."}
{"text":"Kneader's used to be great! A favorite place to grab a quick sandwich. But it has dropped in quality. We've tried several times, thinking maybe it was just an off day. I no longer think that. In the drive-thru they rarely have a total for you until you get to the window and most of the time the order is wrong. Today we went for a late lunch. Ordered a turkey ranch sandwich on a croissant with everything on it, turkey and cheese on white plain, and a kids grilled cheese. Instead of the ranch the croissant had mayo and no onions. The turkey and cheese had avocado on it almost like they started to make a different sandwich. The grilled cheese was extremely greasy. Unfortunately this was the last time for us."}
{"text":"Compared to the other bakery/sandwich places we have around here, this one is the best. Their food is much better quality, fresher, and have no complaints. Also their desserts are delicious! Gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because it is just like every other bakery place.. Not very unique tasting/not a variety of choices.. But nonetheless better than the panera store we have over here"}
{"text":"My only problem with this place is that it's closed on Sundays! But I understand the reasoning. This is an absolute favorite in my house for breakfast, lunch and dinner. It is really reasonably priced for the amount of food you get. I've never had anything bad. The chocolate coconut tarte is AHHHHMAZING!!!"}
{"text":"I ordered the chicken salad sandwich on a croissant which was delicious. I recently just moved to Arizona and I was so excited to have a Kneaders close by again after living in Utah. If you haven't tried their bottomless French Toast highly recommend for breakfast. I love that their restaurants have a gift shop and store.

{"text":"This place is great! Their online ordering process is great, too! And their to-go dishes are top notch. If you get overwhelmed easy when ordering..give online a try to get acquainted :) I love the ham and cheese..and every soup I've tried has been amazing :) Happy eating!!"}
{"text":"Can I tell you that I almost died and went to heaven when I ordered their turkey, bacon, avocado sandwich made with their focaccia bread?

It literally was an explosion of freshness, flavors and yumminess and boy was the serving of this sandwich HUGE.

Every morsel of this sandwich was tasty, loaded with just enough lettuce, onions and secret sauce and most important piled high with moist, moist, moist, turkey so juicy and tasty that I'm dumbfounded why turkey at Thanksgiving can't taste like this.

Not knowing how big their portions were I opted for the deal that included the drink and dessert. I got the organic green tea and fruit tarte for dessert. Both great extra additions to my meal but probably not necessary as the sandwich was more then enough. Needless to say, I was stuffed to the hilt, after having lunch here and couldn't even eat dinner that day.

This is my new favorite place to get a sandwich at and I'm looking forward to trying more things here as it's literally a hop, skip away from my new place."}
{"text":"Literally go here twice a week and that's so bad, but it is so good! I absolutely LOVE the chunky French toast and there delicious syrup and you can't go wrong with adding bacon or sausage! Steven always switches it up with different croissant sandwiches and even a sandwhich in general and we love them! Can't wait to go this week! Yay!"}
{"text":"This Kneaders seems to be better than most I have eaten at.  The staff is very nice and I have always been pleased with how fresh the food is.  I would recommend them for a nice casual lunch."}
{"text":"While Pastrami sandwich was good I didn't like the process meat. Taste wasn't close to a real Pastrami sandwich."}
{"text":"Fresh and delicious food prepared as you order, no pre-made stuff. Feeling hungry try the add ons...great combo with the soup and tuna sandwich."}
{"text":"I've been looking for a Panera replacement and heard this place was good so I had to try it. I read other reviews that complained of the lengthy wait times at the drive-thru, so even though we were taking our food to go, we opted to go inside, thinking it would be faster. Not!! We proceeded to wait in line for about 20 minutes while 2 people in front of us ordered their food and asked a million questions. I don't blame them, we had a ton of questions ourselves. It would help if they put the ingredients of each item on the menu board instead of each person having to ask at the counter. 

The food was just ok, nothing special. My chicken salad croissant had about 2 teaspoons of actual chicken salad on it. My son's sandwich had mustard on it (which he does not like and didn't ask for, so we had to replace with our own bread at home) and his cup of chicken noodle soup had about 5 noodles in it. We bought a loaf of banana bread and it tasted more like cinnamon bread. 

So all in all, if you enjoy mediocre food and you don't mind a long wait, this place is for you!"}
{"text":"The bread pudding has my number. It is so good that I had to start taking a different route home from work just to avoid buying it every night. The pies are delicious and stole the show during Christmas. It did not make the chef of the house very happy. I can't wait to try everything else on the menu. Forget Paradise and Panera.  Go to Kneaders"}
{"text":"Clean and nice, but pretty expensive for those of us on a limited budget.  Food quality is very high, though.  Service is great."}
{"text":"Solid food but lacking a little something.  I like how fresh everything is but my meals always lack a little extra something.  Boyfriend got the French dip, missing like a Worcester sauce or something to that nature! And i got the turkey on focaccia with broccoli cream soup.  The turkey is actual turkey like thanksgiving which wasn't what i was expected but was tasty.  $18 for both my boyfriend and i to eat, to me seems reasonable for fresh and tasty food! 

**Shout out to Diego- he was working hard today and busting his tail while taking orders @  the drive thru all while having fun, need more of him in the world."}
{"text":"Kneaders is a great restaurant! It has a great atmosphere, friendly staff, and tasty food for an affordable price. Every time I go there I feel welcome and it is always really clean. I especially LOVE their chunky cinnamon French toast. Their French toast is all you can eat, it comes with strawberries, whipped cream, and a delicious caramel syrup. It is the best French toast I have ever had and I definitely recommend it!!!!"}
{"text":"With Paradise Bakery closing and bought out by Panera Bread I had to find an alternative. I am so far impressed with Kneaders. I got the turkey cranberry salad and I love it."}
{"text":"Solid place for sandwiches, soups, deserts and small gifts they can even gift wrap for you last minute. I tried a tuna salad on 12 grain fresh delicious bread. The tortilla soup and drink combo was a nice add on for lunch. Don't forget to save room for an indulgent dessert. I opted for the key lime pie and it was the perfect size. The cashier was very nice and brought our food out quickly. They have an almost endless array of fresh bread choices. Next time,  I'm in I'm trying the \"tres leches\" dessert.  Keep up the great work!"}
{"text":"Rolled through the drive-through for the first time and it was very successful. I have eaten at this chain before, but it didn't seem like a drive through kind of place. The large chop salad came fairly quickly and it consists of mostly lettuce, some onions, cherry tomatoes and cucumbers. It actually might need a few more veggies, but the top quality grilled chicken makes up for that loss. They include two dressings and you get bread of your choice with your meal. They should include some butter in the bag and it was a bit of an overkill as they try to upsell you several times at the menu board."}
{"text":"This was the first time to Kneaders. You guys treated me so well, I appreciate how patient you were for a new comer. Oh yeah food was great."}
{"text":"This place has great food. The salads, breads, and soups are fantastic.  I would rate the food above Paradise Bakery easily, above Panera Bread, and slightly above Wildflower Bakery.   Very fresh.  

The decor of the new building is very well done. Nice place to sit in and kept clean.  

Why not 5 stars?  The service both times I've been here has been slow and inattentive. Today there was a large order ahead of us and one person working the register just talking small talk with the customer. (They knew each other). A guy who look like the manager came over and glanced at us but just started talking to the people ordering too. No offer to use the other register or at least acknowledge \"we will be right with you\".  He wasn't doing anything else pressing or helping others or the drive-thru.  Finally the guy from drive-thru looked over at us and asked to help us. This whole experience took about 7 mins with only the single customer in front of us. Not good service.  I will say the guy who finally helped us was great."}
{"text":"Our first visit to Kneaders could be my last.  A colleague and I had lunch Saturday, July 22nd.  We phoned in our order.  We both ordered the Turkey Cranberry Croissant.  When we arrived it was ready.  What a disappointment regarding the sandwiches.  They must of run out of turkey and cranberry sauce.  There were a few slices of turkey and just a smear of cranberry sauce in each of our sandwiches.  I absolutely get the \"complimentary\" side of spring greens but, I didn't think I'd get a \"complimentary\" side of a sandwich.  Dang, I should have taken a photo.  

I did enjoy the Strawberry Tsunami I may possibly come back for that."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a breakfast that's quick but not fast food, Kneaders is the place to go. They have delicious pastries, omelets, and a delicious cinnamon French toast that my picky 10 year old loved. I love the fact that they have a drive-thru for days that I'm on the go, or just need a caffeine fix. Can't wait to be back and try some more of their options."}
{"text":"I'm not usually a sandwich person since I'm vegetarian but their avocado veggie sandwich is fantastic! & the bread is so fresh!  This is the only sandwich place i will go. The french toast is nice & thick too! 

My only criticism is the iced tea. They have 3 flavors, which seems great. But they all taste weird- like drinking flower petals. My friends agreed too. I wouldnt mind a plain iced tea option."}
{"text":"I love the sandwiches. Fun getaway and nice place to visit with friends."}
{"text":"When you don't want to make the drive to Disneyland. This is the next best place! Service was fabulous with Friendly staff, clean environment and delicious food (no matter what you order). Even when it's busy like on a Saturday morning you still feel important."}
{"text":"Best kneaders in the area. Great service. More relaxed. We had some great omelettes and all you can eat French toast. The French toast could have a little more cinnamon. I really like the service."}
{"text":"There was a large dead fly in my salad. Absolutely disgusting. For how expensive this place is you would think they would quality inspect their food. On other occasions I have also seen an employee clean with a broom while using food gloves and then continue to make food without changing gloves.  Will never go back to this location. They clearly need a health inspection."}
{"text":"Food isn't bad. The issue is that the place is so understaffed that waiting to order, and then waiting for it to be brought out is REALLY long."}
{"text":"My first visit to Kneaders and IMHO this place \"Kneads\" better customer service. This is a bakery/restaurant/gift shop and the restaurant was very nicely decorated and clean.

I went with my sister for breakfast and stood at the register while looking at the menu boards.  A couple ahead of us seemed to be finished with their order and were talking with a manager(?) he was wearing a tie and seemed to be \"in charge\"  While we waited, the three continued their conversation (unrelated to the restaurant or their order).  When they finished and we stepped up to begin ordering, the manager told us we needed to go to the other register (it would have been nice to know that earlier),

The restaurant wasn't too busy, and there were lots of employees wrapping gift baskets and preparing food orders.

When we went to place our breakfast order (around 10:30am) they informed us they were out of eggs, but someone had just gone to the store.  We weren't in a hurry to we ordered 2 omelets, 2 coffees and juice.  Since we knew there would be a wait, we asked for our mocha coffees and juice to be sent to our table (they weren't).

When the food (and coffee) arrived, the omelets looked pretty skimpy (maybe they were cutting down on the precious eggs so they wouldn't run out again?) and the juice never appeared.  When we asked the manager for utensils, instead of getting them for us (since we had been waiting), he just told us where to serve ourselves.  No \"sorry to keep you waiting for your food\" or \"Sorry we forgot your juice\" or anything like that.  

Maybe they just had an off day, but for the prices they charge for their food and gifts, I would \"knead\" more to go back."}
{"text":"I waited in line quite a while to order and then quite a long time to receive our food. However, my girls and I were thrilled.  The ambiance is adorable.  A bread bowl of soup (with tons of options to choose from) and a smoothie (with yummy choices!) all for $7?  The flavors were awesome.  We made the mistake of ordering a slice of chocolate peanut butter pie for dessert and we were way to full to even share it.  Took one bite and it wasn't that good anyway.  Threw it away.

Can't wait to come back and I hope they add employees so the service isn't so terrible."}
{"text":"Happily surprised! Amazing baked goods and the chicken noodle soup was as close to homemade as you can get!"}
{"text":"Seriously so disappointed in this place. Twice now I walk in and there is no line and people look at you but don't say anything to you. Both times I've ordered the same items to go. A turkey bacon avecado salad. First time the forget my dressing. Second time they don't put avecado and I find a long dark hair in my salad. You have lost my business and I will not recommended this place. Customer service is key and the definitely lack it."}
{"text":"Today we tried the grown-up version of the grilled cheese, provolone muenster.  SOOOO GOOOD!!!! And the staff there today were great!"}
{"text":"Our family loves this place! The food is always great, the service is personable and their desserts/breads are to die for! The owner, is usually present at the store, especially when they have a rush and I've never had a bad experience there. 
Our favorites are the turkey bacon salad, chicken bbq salad, turkey bacon avocado sammie and of course the kids meals and soups. You can't go wrong with anything you order here, especially when it comes to the desserts! Where else can you get unlimited, fresh, french toast for breakfast!"}
{"text":"Food is excellent! I crave the tuna sandwich with cucumbers often when I'm working in Sun Lakes! Yumm! Only complaint is that today when checking out at the window i said thank you multiple times about them taking my card, getting it back and when they handed me my food. Response back was, \"Yep\"! Everytime.. now i work in a medical office that is required to say, \"my pleasure\" when a patient tells me thank you. Much nicer touch and i recognize peoples response back quite frequently. Just some feedback, I'll totally be back either way but it's a conversation to be had for sure."}
{"text":"Really love this place. The first time we came in, I thought to myself: \"no way, this is awesome!\".  Great customer service, amazing food (especially their bread - to die for!). Have been going there every week: same thing, five-star service, food, atmosphere, every time! I'm a hot tea drinker, and they have the best tea selection I can dream of. The desserts are to die for and the portions are huge! I highly recommend this place - you will not be disappointed. 

PS - their soups - oh yeah, yummmyyyy!"}
{"text":"Great breakfast sandwich! Fast, hot and good. This was our first visit to Kneaders. The shop is really cute and the breads and desserts look delicious. We bought a pumpkin bread loaf to take home. It super fresh and smells wonderful - can't wait to try it."}
{"text":"This is a great place! My husband and I have had lunch at this location twice now and we have yet to be disappointed. The sandwiches are wonderful and their secret sauce is an added bonus on the sandwiches. I have also recently started trying out their bakery items and they do not disappoint. If you are looking for a quick meal that's not fast food this is the place to go."}
{"text":"Once again.....  Kneaders to the rescue!  The chandler location is amazing!  I get in and out so fast and I LOVE sourdough pancakes. Love this location too!  The service is great!"}
{"text":"Best sandwich I've had in a long time! The turkey bacon avocado was delicious and focaccia bread was amazing. The French dip was also SO good. Perfect Au Jus, the meat was tender and lean, and the baguette was amazing. Soft in the center with the perfect crust. HIGHLY recommend"}
{"text":"Love Kneaders. Great food and service. My favorites are the turkey on honey wheat and the chicken pesto panini. Kneaders is much better than Panera and Paradise Cafe."}
{"text":"Great food, great prices, excellent customer services, clean, nice decor.  Got a cinnamon roll and a sausage/egg/cheese croissant. Will come back!"}
{"text":"My experience at this kneaders location was great! I wasn't there during a busy time, about 3:45, but they were very attentive. I placed my to go order and it was ready within 10 minutes. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Visited today for salad and sandwich.  Loved the BBQ chicken salad.  My go to is a turkey sandwich on ciabatta.  The bread was a day too old and tough.   Still love it!"}
{"text":"Kneaders has so much character and charm it's hard not to have an awesome experience here. The staff at this location was prompt and friendly and displayed they work great as a team to serve all of their customers. My food was great and service was so quick-I received my food within 5 minutes of ordering. There was more than enough room for all to sit and enjoy meal time with privacy. I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"I don't get it, what's the hype? I tried it twice because I really wanted to like it based on recommendations from others. Wont be back, it was bland and un-memorable. Both times it took 10 minutes to even give them my order, once drive through, once inside. I will say the inside was clean."}
{"text":"What a terrible experience. I called and asked what soups were available then placed order online and drove to pick it up. Get to the location to be told the soup isn't available. Told I could wait about 10 minutes in parking lot and they'd bring it out. 20 minutes go by and nothing. Head back to the drive thru to see it was waiting on the counter. Then I'm told the dessert I had ordered wasn't available.  Ask for a refund as I don't want to give them my business and I'm on my way. Glance at the refund receipt and its for the dessert only. Head into the store to be questioned why I want a refund and be told I should understand there's other customers they need to serve so it wasn't possible for them to bring the food out. Okay what?  Why even offer to bring it out then??  I felt the guy working had no idea what customer service is. Needless to say won't go back, won't give them my money and please don't give them yours!"}
{"text":"The manager of Kneaders saw my review on Yelp.  He apologized for the Employee who didn't handle the situation the right way.  He invited us to return and give him another chance.  We did go back and asked for him, Kellen, who is the Owner.  He was very apologetic for our last visit and offered us sandwiches and dessert at his expense.  This time the sandwiches were absolutely delicious and made perfect.  The cheesecake was excellent.
Thank you Kellen for making a bad situation good and taking care of your customers.  This is how a business should be run.  We definitely will be back and we appreciate you making our return visit a pleasant one.  See you soon."}
{"text":"This is my favorite restaurant in the entire Phoenix valley. Why? The food is amazing, the service is wonderful, and the people are...well, very personable! They even have a little boutique gift shop in every restaurant where you can do a little shopping while waiting for your food to arrive. Or hum along to their rotating oldies playlist. Or you can nosh on a piece of one of their homemade breads, all baked on-site. I don't know what it is about their breads, but they are just absolutely AWESOME! Yeah, I know I need to watch my carbs like everyone else, but hey, you gotta indulge once in a while! In fact...if you want to indulge, don't miss their to-die-for desserts! They have a rolling selection depending on the season--same with their sandwiches, salads, soups, etc.--but you will never leave disappointed or anything less than full. My favorite part? I've gone in there so many times (and ordered catering from them twice in the year since they've been open) that they know and GREET me by name, from the busboy up to the owner! How astonishing is that?!? [It might also have something to do with the fact that my name is on my frequent-eater card, which earns me cash toward future purchases, but a girl can dream.] I think the people are really why I keep going back, and why I suggest meeting every business associate and family member there. The place is just lovely and the people are oh-so friendly. How can you beat all that? Not with a stick, I say! ;)"}
{"text":"I came here Saturday to pick some breakfast. Tried the Greek Omellette and Italian Omellette both were delicious. Loved the cheese in them. They are priced reasonable at $6.99. They also have good selection of drinks and wide range of desserts.

{"text":"Fresh, fast and tasty ! I had the 1/2 size bacon turkey avocado salad and a bowl of tortilla soup, my husband had the turkey sandwich on croissant with a cup of tortilla soup. We both absolutely loved the soup, it was thick and full of flavor.  Salad was on par with any other restaurant salad . We were both in love with the bread! But wait... there's more!! here's a huge tip people - on Saturdays starting at 8pm all bread is $3 a loaf and some of their pastries are 1/2 off .. you better believe we made a 2nd trip to grab some cheap bread ."}
{"text":"Well, let me start off by saying I thoroughly enjoyed my citrus chicken salad. It was very tasty; all of the ingredients complemented each other well and tasted fresh. Even the orange slices were delectable. 

However, everyone knows that a good establishment has great customer service, this place could use a little refresh on that. Granted, I will say I visited during lunch business hours, I originally wanted to give them 3 stars but i figure they're doing the best they can. Upon entering this location, it took about 1 minute for anyone to acknowledge my presence as I was standing at the counter waiting to order. All I expected was a \"hello, I'll be with you soon\" but of all the people who had a visual on me, nothing was said until my order was taken. The man taking my order seemed rushed and this dissuaded me from really getting into asking him questions about the menu. Also, while eating, one of the employees began sweeping the floor adjacent to my table and stood there sweeping the goop into the dust pan probably about 3 feet away from me, I may be picky, but sh*% like that bothers me. 

Other than the inattentiveness, the food really was good."}
{"text":"My new favorite lunch place. If I'm going to have bread, their freshly baked bread is the splurge. I had the French dip and it was divine.     I don't find that in menus too often. Sometimes they have pastry samoles. I like looking at their holiday themed decorations while I'm waiting. I took a point off because the cashier wasn't cheery as the others."}
{"text":"Read the reviews and was excited to try this place for lunch.  The food was excellent and the bread was super tasty.  Go with a pumpkin chocolate chip cookie...may be the best ever made.  In fact get two.  They are delicious."}
{"text":"My friend brought me here, and I'm glad she did. I ordered the chicken pesto panini and a chocolate dome for dessert. They offer samples and I ended up getting the cranberry pistachio bread as well to bring back home. The chicken pesto was tasty, a good portion you can split with someone. The chocolate dome dessert was delicious not overly sweet, you can actually taste chocolate not just sugar. 

The service is awesome, place is cute, with a rustic home decor, they have a little store front area that sells merchandise that looks to be localy made, jewelry, jams, syrups, etc. If I lived here I would definitely keep coming back daily just for the baked goods alone.  Since I'm not I will have to visit when I return."}
{"text":"Amazing frappès!! Seriously so good (especially with one shot of espresso). The pastries are also very good."}
{"text":"Great sandwiches, soups, and even better desserts, all of which are made fresh. While it's not all that different than Paradise, Panera, Wildflower, or places similar to that, I'd place it above each of them... and especially so for the aforementioned desserts.

Oh, they also have a drive thru. Bonus."}
{"text":"My mother and I both enjoyed the turkey avocado sandwich with chips.  The bread was good, ingredients were fresh and it was filling.  I ordered apple cinnamon bread pudding and my mother chose a brownie.  We both thought our desserts were delicious and had a difficult time choosing a dessert because of the variety available.  I also ordered a decorated sugar cookie and a cinnamon roll to take to my son.  In addition to the large offering of soups, salads, sandwiches & desserts, there's a little shopping area with some cute choices.  I'd also like to mention the young man at the register.  He was extremely polite and knowledgeable and made small talk.  He attended the same university my son is at so as common Wildcat fans we had something to talk about.  He is an asset to this location."}
{"text":"I love the sourdough pancakes! They are addicting;) I've had a breakfast croissant sandwich here, and they do skimp on the meat. Also the pancakes are inconsistent.... Sometimes they are big, sometimes they are small. The cup with butter and strawberries is sometimes full, and other times not. One of my favorite breakfast drive thrus for pancakes."}
{"text":"We had a great experience at this Kneaders.  I'm pleasantly surprised considering how new it is but they clearly have figured it out.  We were greeted by more than one friendly face upon entering and the sweet young lady behind the cash register was patient with us as we decided what we wanted.  The food was good and we didn't have to wait very long for it.  The restaurant was clean and quiet.  What more can one ask for?  Thanks Kneaders!"}
{"text":"Finally got to eat here and wow this might be one of my new favorite lunch spots during the week.  

For me everything was so much better than Paradise or Panera. You walk in and it's clean, modern, yet homely feeling. Right off the bat they entice you with a cornucopia of desserts just calling your name. It's this genius marketing tactic that had me ordering a Cannoli along with my sandwich. Mmmm definitely hit the spot and put me over the full meter. 

I ordered the turkey, avocado on focaccia bread. Wow this thing was huge. Next time I'll order a half sandwich. But bread was fresh and soft. Overall I'd easily order again.  

Until next time. Already thinking of which dessert I'll get."}
{"text":"Great place, great food and great service. I've been here a handful of times and the staff is always friendly and welcoming. 
My favorites are the turkey panini and German chocolate pudding! Their breads tastes freshly made. I do wish they had a little bit more variety on their menu. I won't complain. ..I will be back!"}
{"text":"I always come here for lunch! Love this place and their employees!!  Their pastries are even better!"}
{"text":"Fresh baked bread, soups, salads, sandwiches, pastries.    It's all good.   I enjoyed a Reuben panini on rye with a cup of chicken tortilla soup.    They both hit the spot"}
{"text":"I AM OBSESSED with their Chunky Cinnamon French toast. It is *unlimited* on the weekends, comes with strawberries, whipped cream and CARAMEL SYRUP. Absolutely to die for. For lunch I love love love getting the Turkey Bacon Avocado."}
{"text":"Tried this location for the first time. Plenty of parking, which is a bonus around here. 

The French toast was amazing! It came with whipped butter and strawberries and a side of incredibly creamy caramel (warm) syrup.  If you don't like sweets, they have eggs and pastries too.

{"text":"Much like other bakeries and cafes of the local variety, this is a great place to grab a good sandwich or other quick bite to eat. My only complaint is I think they're slightly overpriced. In regards to the food, we had the turkey bacon avocado, a cold sandwich, and the turkey artichoke panini, a hot sandwich. Both were pretty good and I would recommend those choices. We also shared a slice of the carrot cake, and it was pretty fantastic. Their carrot cake also consists of zucchini which really adds to the texture of it. A plus to Kneaders is that they have a drive-thru....for those days you can't be bothered to get out of the car :-) And for those days you can't be bothered to leave your home? They deliver. I'd go back to Kneaders."}
{"text":"What a wonderful find! We had just arrived in Chandler to visit family during St. Valentine's weekend. It was Friday around 9:40pm. Our lovely, elderly aunt was concerned that we had not yet eaten after arriving and gently convinced us that she was hungry, that she we should join her. She knew a good place. We arrived 20 mins. to closing. Were we too late? \"Not at all\" commented the young man applying the finishing touches to a very clean floor. He invited us in and introduced us to the order attendant. She was so helpful, patient and accommodating to us and our delightful aunt. We all had Chicken la Mond salad (great choice)and various soups. My broccoli soup was super tasty, not over thickened at all. Wife's potato bacon soup was pretty tasty , she hardly shared:) However, aunt's tomato basil soup was the star. The young man(manager) approached our table, told us the restaurant was now closed, but we were not to be concerned. He treated us as though we were in his own home. We had the opportunity to sample Kneaders hazelnut, multigrain bread. Try it. Thank you Sam for treating us as family."}
{"text":"We've been here twice now. First time, we had the loaded potato soup in a sour dough bread bowl. We liked the bread better than Panera. The bacon, however, was chewy and kept getting caught in our teeth, which I found highly undesirable. Next time we tried the turkey, bacon, avocado on focaccia. I posted a picture. It was thrown together, and it was a really weird cut of meat for a sandwich. The other sandwich was a French Dip which was fine. There needs to be some attention to detail. We may try it again in a few months."}
{"text":"I've driven by dozens of times and am so glad I finally stopped by and tried their breakfast. Chunky French toast was delish! Great casual spot for grabbing a bite, but also has a counter full of breads and sweets that were impossible to walk away from empty handed. Will def be going back!"}
{"text":"I specifically showed up at 10:40 just for the French toast and to my surprise they were \"OUT\" of French toast, terrible such an inconvenience and I'm pretty upset about it..."}
{"text":"Very friendly drive through. The breakfast sandwhich is huge! You can tell that the egg is freshly cracked. The sausage tastes fresh too.
Give this place a try, you wont be dissapointed!"}
{"text":"So happy to see this location! Food is great, service at the drive though is friendly. I recommend the turkey artichoke and spinach panini."}
{"text":"Great place to grab a bite.  I have eaten there several times, and everything I had for both breakfast and lunch was delicious.  Even though this restaurant is part of a chain, what makes this location unique is the warm and friendly service, which is something you would expect from a small mom & pop shop, not a franchise restaurant.  In fact, it is not uncommon to see the owner, walking around with a big cheerful smile on his face, greeting customers and chatting with diners.  

At this location, you get the feeling that you are visiting a small-town bakery where everyone knows each other, the aroma of freshly baked bread fills the air, and the glass cases are filled with sinful confectionery temptations.

To the owner and his team I want to say: Great Job for proving that excellent customer service is not dead!

{"text":"great place.  We held our client party here a couple of months ago and they were very accomodating to us and gave us the patio to use."}
{"text":"Arrived here with very large group-15 during weekend lunch time. Owner was kind, proffesional and promised to have our large group completed within our lunch break.

All 15 individuals in our group enjoyed there food and would be happy to visit again."}
{"text":"It's a cafe. Food is alright but nothing to write home about. Bread is average but I think their french toast is worth the visit."}
{"text":"They have delicious coffee and omelettes along with a nice choice of baked goods. The chocolate chip bread or muffin was offered as a sample and it was delicious. Will go there again. Nice friendly staff and the restaurant is very clean."}
{"text":"First visit for breakfast and actually dining in. We don't always go out for breakfast but today I wanted to take my girls for a date since school was out. I've read rave reviews about the French toast and figured my girls would love it. 

Walked in and to my surprise, the place is super cute with lots of things for sale. I almost bought my daughter an apron so she can cook with me but I'm thinking I'll surprise her for her birthday. Anyway, we ordered the French toast, pancakes and I had a breakfast sandwich. We sat down and the food came shortly after that. The portions were huge and the girls ate about half of each. I tried both and it was good. Read the sign and it says all you can eat French toast and pancakes if you dine in...my girls could not eat anymore but saved the rest for later. My breakfast croissant was amazing, my girls had 2 bites each and wanted more. 

The staff was pleasant and the place was clean. We spend about $20 for the 3 of us and we even got an almond croissant to go. Score!!"}
{"text":"I loveee a good eat after my workout and this place always delivers! The chicken pesto is soooo yummy and the breakfast sandwiches are too. The staff is great and ready to help out. 
I love coming here and def. recommend it:)"}
{"text":"My wife drove through on her way home from work and picked up 2 desserts.
Hers, raspberry cake was fine.
The bread pudding was at best, a scraping of the pan. About 2 tablespoons of mush.
Whoever served that portion needs to work in some other field, perhaps brick laying. No pride shown at all!
Waste of hard earned money."}
{"text":"By far, this is the best sandwich shop I've been to in Arizona. I spoke with the manager and they opened this location approximately a month ago (I believe there is another well established one in Tempe). The restaurant is extremely clean, organized, have lots of choices for desserts, fresh bake bread as well as different types of sandwiches you can choose from. While you are waiting, you can browse through accessories, home decorative items, kitchen items that they sell nearby the counter. I even saw a relaxing fireplace area in the dining area. The containment area is awesome. It offers 3 different flavor of coffee and ice tea. Staffs were super friendly and attentive. I order a crossiant sandwich that came with a small salad. It was fresh, fluffy and delicious. On our way out, we ordered total of 5 dessert (including fruit tarts, cannoli, and more) and they gave us one for free. 

I'll definitely come back here again and weekend night for a coffee and dessert with friends."}
