{"text":"Been trying to get them to make Cucumber-Avacado sushi rolls for Y-E-A-R-S-!!! To no avail. Just called, again, to ask if they had (or could make) 2 orders and the guy tells me that they have one order, in a refridgerator, that was made at 9-10am.... it's now 5:30PM!! 
The girl at the Central location with the mouth pearcings was a complete jackass about it as well.. when I asked for them she laughed and replied, \"We don't make those on the weekends...\" yeah, it was FRIDAY!! idiot. 
The manager, Rafeal, is a nice guy, and swears up and down that they will make them for you, always.. 
yeah, that must be the \"always\" that doesn't include me. 

YOSHIS!! If you don't intend to serve the Cucumber-Avacado rolls then TAKE THEM OFF OF THE MENU!! 

sheeeeeeeeeesh!!"}
{"text":"Love the food here! They are so busy on weekdays at lunchtime, and no wonder why. The Dragon Beef and Dragon Chicken are spicy and flavorful, the orange chicken is delicious.

They also have a terrific \"Happy Hour\" special for Terriyaki Bowls, which are a big favorite."}
{"text":"My coworkers and I have this at least once a week. Aside that it's walking distance, their food has yet to disappoint me. I might just go in today!"}
{"text":"Staff are always friendly.  The food is your average Japanese fast food. It's clean and a convenient location.  During the week lunch they are always busy. Make sure to give yourself enough time."}
{"text":"Man!! That Sumo bowl is AWESOME!!! I always get it with noodles and it's filled to the brim!!"}
{"text":"Ordered the Sesame Chicken extra Spicy...and it came out quick and hot. The rice was very nice...done to perfection. I will def be back to try more items from the menu"}
{"text":"good customer service but overpriced low quality sushi."}
{"text":"Your typical rice bowl joint.  They have some good dishes, but be warned, they tend to be very random with their spicy dishes.  One day its really mild, the next day you feel like a dragon is breathing down your throat.  It is fairly fast during the lunch crowd (even if you see a lot of people lined up) and has decent prices.  Nothing really special to write home about but I'd pick this place over a rice bowl chain."}
{"text":"Dinner was great. Had the large beef bowl; beef, broccoli, and rice. Very delicious and satisfied my hunger. Friendly staff and great cook. Thanks!"}
{"text":"The 3 stars given on this review are for the food, which is fantastic and reasonably priced. The Teriyaki Chicken bowl is very good and my favorite is the Sesame Chicken bowl.

The reason I don't give this place 4 or 5 stars, is the consistent rudeness\slowness of the staff during the weekday lunch hour. I go as often as once a week, but often nobody is managing the counter, or they ignore the customers for a bit, or they give dirty looks when taking orders.

Go for the food, not the service."}
{"text":"This was the first time my husband and I went here, and it will be the last time, I can assure you.  Why?  For a few reasons.

First, the moment I walked in, I got a strong whiff of what smelled like urine; it was almost overpowering.  I am sure there weren't any buckets of the stuff sitting around anywhere, so I assume it was the smell of the food.  What will that portend?

Second, the food was mediocre at best.  The most enjoyable part of my meal was the fresh white-meat chicken for my Teriyaki bowl.  The rice was gummy, and the sauce tasted too sugary.  I suppose it shouldn't matter, since it was Happy Hour, and they priced it 2.77 per bowl.

Something that seriously irritated me was the salad.  I don't eat carrots, so I asked them if they could make me one without them.  What that resulted in was a salad of ONLY lettuce.  Nothing else.  Just lettuce.  And a thimble's worth of some undefined type of dressing that wasn't sufficient.

On a positive note, the restaurant was clean, and the staff was friendly.  But this wasn't enough to redeem this place.  We certainly won't be returning."}
{"text":"Gosh so wish their were a Yoshi's here in Portland. The yummy food at Yosh's is greatly missed. Terriyaki salmon, udon noodle soup, miso soup. The food is delicious and filling. Prices are fair. Ate here at least once a week. Dam we need a Yoshi's here."}
{"text":"went in on saturday sept 5th for dinner before work. I ordered a salad that comes with avacodo. I did not receive avacado, or if it was in there it was so small that I could not find it. I told the girl behind the counter and the first thing she said was \"there are 3 slices in the salad.\" not, I'm sorry let me get you some, or something to that effect. she immediately went on the defensive. she was very snippy, she had just been rude to another customer a few minutes earlier as well. although I am the \"duchess\" at this establishment, I will be abdicating my throne lol."}
{"text":"Food is decent. Depending on who u get on any given day, service is ok. But c'mon Yoshi, could u clean the place up and update it out of the mid 80's for GOD SAKE!!! Women's bathroom is dirty as hell and the entire place could use an overall BLEACHING!! Considering most of the time, Yoshi himself is sitting around there constantly checking his phone, maybe HE could do SOMETHING?!?"}
{"text":"They say you get what you pay for, prices are fantastic, and food was surprisingly good, I live a block away and plan to continue going here for some quick sesame chicken!"}
{"text":"Oh my! This place has the best spicy fried rice!! The Dragon Fried Rice is was I would recommend in a heart beat! I wish I had this place closer to work for lunch!! :) Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I looked this place up online because it's right down the street. I saw that you can get salmon but replace the rice for noodles. So I went down there. Because I don't like rice. So I go in there and say, \"I'll take the salmon and replace the rice for noodles\" This chick said, \"nah, we only do salmon on Friday's\". I said, \"ok, cool whatcha got for me, baby?\" She said, \"try the yakisoba bowl if you like noodles\". It was excellent. Service was great."}
{"text":"Don't know why this place gets busy. I felt sick eating my chicken yakisoba bowl so I threw it away. I'd rather go to the teriyaki places at a food court in a mall."}
{"text":"Service is great, never had a bad experience, sometimes can be over cooked.. and I'm pretty particular about my chicken. Otherwise it's alright."}
{"text":"I can't believe the rating is so low for this spot! It's quick and delicious!!!! We eat here regularly because we work nearby and I am always happy with what I get!! I highly recommend the Teryaki chicken bowl or the orange chicken!"}
{"text":"Terrible service.  I've been back several times and they forget my request and give me whatever they feel like.

The last time was the final straw.  I asked for extra noodles instead of rice and some extra sauce.  They didn't give me noodles, rice, or extra sauce.  I asked the cashier and she handed me soy sauce.  I explained I don't want soy sauce and asked again for the correct sauce and my noodles.  She handed me another soy sauce and said the noodles are already in my dish.  It was like talking to someone from another planet.

I retreated and took my meal.  I wrote the owner about it and was ignored.  Fine by me.  Two can play that game.  Consider yourself ignored from my wallet."}
{"text":"Love this place man. Check out their happy hour. 2.77 for teriyaki chicken bowl. The dragon beef is delicious!"}
{"text":"Udon noodles were so good!!! I drove about 25 min just to have them from this place. I order them whenever I see them on a menu and these ones were on my top 3 favorites."}
{"text":"If you're looking for something quick, inexpensive, and healthy, Yoshi's is a great option! It does smell a bit like Subway but if you can get past that, I promise that you'll enjoy! Their white meat teriyaki bowl with vegetables is my go-to. I also order it with spicy teriyaki sauce! I always get the side salad because their ginger dressing is FANTASTIC! I stop in here about once a month and must say, i'm always satisfied!"}
{"text":"They serve good fast food here...but the employees are a bit clueless.

The don't seem to understand that when you order AND PAY FOR online, that the food be ready when asked for online. (They have 10-min intervals). Twice in a row, I scheduled for a 4:10p pickup as I only have half an hour for lunch. Leaving my building and arriving at the assigned time, my order wasn't ready. When I testily asked why, the counter girl said if they prepared it early, people didn't pick it up. DUHHHHHHHHHHH!!! If I've ALREADY paid for it, I'm going to pick it up.

Management needs to brief their employees on how to correctly handle online orders. I'm sure I'm not the only one this is happening to and I CANNOT afford to wait while others who just showed up are ahead of me.

There are PLENTY of places around that area who manage this small task correctly (Subway right next door for one). I really don't want to give this place up...but ya gotta work with me here."}
{"text":"Hibachi chicken is on point!!! And most places boil their chicken , this place does not"}
{"text":"i may have been here a few time but i hate myself in the morning. the food is ok nothing great and some of it down right nasty. the crowd ranges from business type to hoodlums. now that i am not working in that hood anymore i will never set foot in here again.i;m sure."}
{"text":"A bowl of rice and a very nice price and and alot of spice is what makes me come here.

I can get a Salmon bowl with brown rice and and a ton of hot spice for less than $7. 

Walk in there is a line leading up to the some registers and meny board on the wall, the usual Jap fair chiken teriaki bowls etc, options for all while meat and the like.

I got for the salmon bowl $5.99, a great way to have fish that is not fried at a decent lunch price. I find the teriaki sauce a bit much so I order light on the sauce. for $.25 more you can upgrade to the health factor of brown rice.

Get your bowl and head to the condiment area, there is hot chilli powder, sauce and sliced green onion. I really appreciate the onions.

I think some of the low scores come from the fact japanese food just does not have the flavor punch that Chinese and Thai do."}
{"text":"3 out of 5 might be a little unfair because I'm comparing to places like Moto. If you are looking for a fast inexpensive sushi place then you've struck gold here.   They didn't have tootsie roll so we got California roll for everyone.  It was good not great not as fresh tasting as Moto but good none the less.  The sushi menu seems limited but they are known for the overall menu not just sushi. 

The facility on 24th street as clean and bigger than it looks on the outside.  Also according the lil C and R dubs the panda on the sweet and sour sauces packet is really cute. We ordered 3 California roll spring roll and orange chicken.  Overall the meal was good. To be honest the orange chicken might give Panda Express a run for the money. The girls and I enjoyed our meal and I can see us coming back here and trying more of the menu. I give it 3 fish heads out of 5 and Carolyn 3 1/2 out of 5"}
{"text":"I like the food here but since the new staff took over a couple of months ago the service is horrible.  Staff is non friendly especially the lady at the cash register.  If you go past 1130am during the weekday plan on waiting 10-15 mins to get your food.  I go here daily and this is the case 9 times out of 10.  I keep going because I like the food and its healthy.  Taking advantage of the 15% off from lunchclub and getting a stamp each visit keeps me coming back.  Wouldn't suggest this place unless you can be very patient and ok with their cold attitude."}
{"text":"If it's good enough for AC Green it's good enough for me.  (Those who have eaten here will know what I mean)

The yaki soba is just a shade above average but it gets bonus points for having a lot of vegetables and being so cheap."}
{"text":"Disappointing  

Today, I was craving a chicken and rice bowl and deicded to go to Yoshi's. The facility is fairly clean and the staff is  friendly, accomdating, and the prices are very  reasonable. 

For under seven dollars, I was able to purchase , a soft drink, eggroll, and teriyaki chicken  bowl. The order took  less then 5 minutes to prepare. Now, in all fairness While I shouldn't expect much for seven dollars, I was dissapointed nonetheless, as the teriyaki chicken was dry, the sauce was sugary, and the white rice was overcooked and lumpy.

Overall, it was worth the price and fills the stomach, however I won't be going back any time soon."}
{"text":"Had lunch here yesterday, it wasn't bad. I do wish their bowls were a little larger so there is room to get the food from the bottom of the bowl. I don't want to just eat the protein off the top then only eat the vegetables, then only eat the rice."}
{"text":"This location fills up fast during lunch hour. Their food is aways fresh and fast service. Unfortunately the Hawaiian salad I ordered was not portioned appropriately. Watch out for resturants that try to give you more lettuce than what all your're paying for on else on the plate."}
{"text":"I decided to stop by on my way back from ABC decorations.  I saw the place was busy so must mean pretty good food?  Yeah, I was wrong.  Ordered the teriyaki chicken bowl, you cannot go that wrong with it.  The sauce was so sweet.  It was like eating maple sauce with chicken and rice.  Too sweet for my taste.  I should have read the Yelp review before I went there."}
{"text":"Not a very good place for vegetarians. The soups are fish based. You can get steamed vegetables and rice and add tofu if you want a meal.

Was not impressed.  

WIFI didn't work either."}
{"text":"I used to live less than a block away from this place and would eat there lots. I think this place is really good for what it is. The price is right, the soba is good and my wife loved the dynamite chicken rice bowl. An added bonus is the basketball theme for AC Greene fans.

Better for you than Jack in the Box."}
{"text":"The food is great when they get the orders right. I've ordered take out twice from Yoshis this week, both were wrong."}
{"text":"First time eating here, I opened up my freshly cooked Katsu Chicken the food was great!!!!

The service was amazing i felt like a valued customer!"}
{"text":"This place is not what it use to be. Kinda run down. The girl who worked at the front does not seem happy or like she even wants to be here. Also sushi was over rouge for basically gas station quality or store bough.  Good value for the teriyaki bowl of you are here for happy hour from 3 to 5. Other wise I would not recommend for the price."}
{"text":"This is a great place for a quick rice bowl.  I normally call in my order.  The Teriyaki sauce is thick, not sweet, and flavorful.  The chicken is plentiful, grilled flavor and I normally ask for veggies to be included to pretend I'm being extra healthy.  Price is reasonable."}
{"text":"\"Have a rice day!\"

Solid rice bowls for quick, savory, reasonably priced meals.  Having been a patron of Yoshi's on and off for nearly ten years, they are consistent; clean, a flair for local sports, considerate service, and flavorful rice bowls.  Unforgiving reviews for the sushi seem erroneous, as countless places offer things on their menu that I steer away from, and that doesn't say anything about why I do go there.  Substitutions are easily acquired, so if there is something that one wants to stay away from, like raw meats or a certain spice, they are very willing to accommodate.  The Sumo Bowl could easily feed one, but it wouldn't be able to sit in their snug booths to eat it; for those of us who practice the art of the belly grab a chair at a table or even outside if summer has relented.  On the corner, plenty of parking, easy in and easy out, makes Yoshi's great take out."}
{"text":"I still love the food here.  it's quick, good and the service has always been great to me.  Sucks that they're trading staff with the Central location.  Oh well..

I haven't been here in years, but ordered my favorite Yakisoba and an egg roll.  I personally think these guys have the best egg rolls.  

Also the owner actually works out of this location.  On occasion, Ive seen a few Suns drop in too.

Good times, good stuff!"}
{"text":"Was a customer almost daily until today...I got the teriyaki bowl with vegetables and rice and come to find out that the bowl was recycled. Not the bowl itself the rice. There is rice with sauce and vegetables in the bottom then there's another layer of smash rice then the veggies and the chicken...adding picture"}
{"text":"Absolutely my go to for affordable chicken and rice on the go. It's hard to eat healthy with fast food and this would be my favorite just for that.

I recommend the teriyaki chicken (white meat) with vegetables and large size for 2.

This isn't reinventing the wheel, but it's the solid, healthy, quick option for me.

Thank You Yoshi's!"}
{"text":"I work close to yoshis and for quick and cheap sushi rolls, it works! The chicken bowl was also delicious with lots of veggies. This is my third time here since March and today I saw they just added a crepe station where you can get nutella, fruit and other sweet goodies as toppings; there are also savory options. I would definitely choose this place over samurai sams or kyoto."}
{"text":"Don't let the worn exterior fool you, Yoshi's is a safe option for Asian fast food. There's a reason it's been around for as long as I can remember! 

It's got a limited menu of terriyaki bowls and the like (meat + vegetabes + rice), spring rolls, and even some sushi, which I have not tried. 

When I'm in a hurry, it's all about grabbing the terriyaki chicken bowl. About 6 bucks and 6 minutes later, I've got a satisfying lunch! 

I mean, don't expect anything fancy. It's just OK. But it's worth the break from the burgers and burritos on just about every corner around. =)"}
{"text":"I have had Yoshi's before and never had a problem.... but I have never been to this one until recently. 

It looked clean inside, but as I learned looks can be deceiving. I wound up with food poisoning the next day. Worst experience ever! 

Try at your own risk. You have been warned."}
{"text":"I always drive by during lunch hour and it is always jam packed. Today my curiosity got the best of me, and I can say I am not disappointed. Although I had to order to go, I can only imagine how great the food was while dining in. I ordered the udon noodle soup with chicken and a tereyaki chicken bowl and they were both delicious! Will definitely be coming back! So long Panda Express !"}
{"text":"Yoshis is getting 3 stars mainly because of how nice the people here are. The place is sparse and looks like a cafeteria, but it is clean. 

We decided to go because who doesn't love a good deal with a $2.77 chicken teriyaki bowl? But you get what you pay for. The food was ready in about 3 minutes. The chicken was comparable, but the white rice was on the soggy side and the brown rice was crunchy and tasteless. I got the Hibachi steak which looked drenched in oil. The noodles were so soaked and fried it had that weird after taste. The amount of actual veggies did not come close to matching the photo on the menu nor did they seem fresh. (Another sign...if the restaurant has photos of the food...well, you know). 

Heading back to Tokyo Joes for our fix of fast food Japanese rice bowls."}
{"text":"GROSS!! I 'literally' just had this place for lunch about 10 minutes ago and seriously, their food is pretty nasty.

I had the \"California Roll\", I put it in quotes because they're clearly store bought and NOT homemade and tasted appropriately so. The order came with four rolls, I regretfully ate one and threw the rest away.

I also had a Chicken Yakisoba, smallest portion I've ever seen for an 'asian food' place and it cost $5 bucks and some change at that. The broccoli was not steamed, pretty much raw and the whole thing just tasted burnt! and greasy! 

Absolutely not worth it. Disgusting! Just go somewhere else. BLEH!"}
{"text":"This used to be a premier rice bowl restaurant and now it has turned into absolute garbage. The staff is seriously rude, they started using a different chicken, and it doesn't taste or feel the same. 

I go now to Yogi's on Camelback for a better experience."}
{"text":"Love this place. The price and healthiness of the food is everything. $7.00 for large chicken veg bowl 8oz of meat good portions"}
{"text":"I wish I would have done a review the first time I had it, because the bowl was fairly good...a little shy on flavor, but it is what it is for $6-$7.  However, this time....I ordered a bowl with brown rice, white meat chicken and veggies....3 things in this bowl and 1 (the veggies) were left out.  Very disappointed in this and makes me iffy on going back if a third of my order was left out..."}
{"text":"quick easy spot for lunch. My go to item is Dragon chicken which is a mix of grilled chicken with with carrots bell pepper and onions over rice. You can taste a little bit of spice and for lack of a better phrase \"asian flavors\" beyond just soy sauce. Maybe its sesame seed and chilli powder. I always add green onions and the chili paste they have on the side where the condiments are . I've gotten beef dishes once in a while which is not bad but definitely had more different chicken dishes from here. My other fave is viva caliente bowl. Not as much veggies but seems like its a mix of spicy teriyaki and jalapenos with grilled chicken over rice. Most of the bowls come in two sizes and even the large is only 7ish. Ive had the noodle dishes but cant say I love them. ...Almost forgot they have happy hour!! 2.75 for teriyaki bowls 3-5. same price if you want spicy teriyaki sauce as well. dark meat chicken over rice quick afternoon fix."}
{"text":"Luv this place! Been going for yrs & they keep hangin' there & re-inventing themselves! Some of best egg rolls in town!!"}
{"text":"First visit here. Went in the evening and there was a steady flow of traffic coming through. I got the tempura udon. The food was very fast and the portion size was good. The udon was...interesting. I'm not sure what was in the tempura pancake. It was good though. It reminded me of the pancakes I've gotten from Japanese bento restaurants in Hawaii. I haven't eaten it anywhere else outside of Hawaii so I was pleasantly surprised. However, I was in the mood for \"regular\" tempura so I thought I was getting some vegetables and maybe a shrimp. The pancake thing wasn't filling. They also put broccoli and green beans in the udon. Gotta say that's a first for me. Lol. The soup was a little salty for my taste. But the udon noodles were on point. Would I go back? Eh... I wouldn't say it was bad. It was just, okay."}
