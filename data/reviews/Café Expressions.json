{"text":"The perfect neighbourhood cafe!   Expressions is down the street from me, so I spend a lot of time hanging out here. The food is good, and they serve Toi Moi et Cafe coffee, which is delicious. The dizzying selection of teas will surely appeal to any non-coffee folks. I wouldn't necessarily order a bagel here with St-Viateur a block over, but their breakfast specials are all excellent. There's a good selection of fair-trade and organic, too.  I love the couches, the bookshelf full of reading material in French and English, the cool music, and the free WiFi.  The Plateau can suffer from pretentiousness and hipster-itis sometimes, but Expressions is a good escape from all that. It's low-key and welcoming, a good place to relax, catch up on some work or some reading, and watch the day go by.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Latte wasn't very good. The milk was well made, not over heated, but the coffee it was made from was not robust or fresh tasting."}
{"text":"This is my 'office' when I'm not on-site with a client.  It's a lovely, homey, chill-axed space with solid wifi and friendly staff.  The coffee is great, and I don't say that lightly.  I drink black coffee (black black, not black with sugar), so I get to taste coffee in all its raw glory.  When I need to buy beans, I come here.  Cafe Expressions has seemingly billions of kinds of beans, most of them fair trade and/or organic.  Most of the staff is bilingual, and they also stock both french and english weekly papers.  A nice touch is that they also have french and english daily papers.    They have sturdy marble and cast-iron tables with wooden chairs, or you can choose from a few slightly run-down arm-chairs.  There is a sweet, often taken spot right by the front window, where you can chill in a red arm-chair, sip your delicious coffee and watch the world go by (meaning the pretty girls on mont royal)."}
{"text":"Cosy, unique little shop with an exceptional selection of coffees, loose leaf tea blends  and baked goods. Free wifi and good music to boot."}
{"text":"We chose the place since it was one of very few coffee places open at that time (9.p.m.). Althought the door sait it's open until 11 p.m. m they started closing before 10, without any previous information and despite of the fact that the cafe was half full.    I must say they serve decent coffee and their carrot-caramel cheesecake was one of the best I have ever had. Additionally they have wide choice of cheesecake fravours and other desserts, for which I give them 3 stars."}
{"text":"Good coffee and tea selection. Good service. Small selection of baked goods to choose from but  adequate. Comfortable and clean."}
{"text":"from a cafe snob, who likes good cozy atmosphere (for rain or shine), rich delicious coffee, and not overpriced, this place is 5*. Brick walls, spacious, healthy muffins, super nice staff."}
{"text":"L'un des cafés les plus chaleureux de l'avenue Mont-Royal; mais on n'y trouve pas seulement que de la chaleur, qui est soit dit en passant émanée par la jovialité du personnel. Son service Wi-Fi gratuit, l'aire de jeux pour enfants et bien-sûr, le délicieux café équitable et biologique, que l'on retrouve à la tonne, font du Café Expression une place franchement unique, fort estimée par une clientèle de bric et de broc. Le parfum du café, s'exhalant dans la moindre parcelle d'air, est enivrant; moi qui n'étais entré que pour uriner, ai fini par me retrouver attablé devant un double allongé succulent (ok, je suis accroc).   Ceux qui désirent s'approprier des mélanges exclusifs de café en vrac (dont une vingtaine de mélanges maison) auront de quoi ruminer longtemps leurs choix. Australie Mountain Top Estate Extra Fancy, Sumatra Mandheling Noir, Tanzanie Peaberry Noir, Costa Rica Tarrazù, Pérou Chanchamayo, Jamaïcain Blue Mountain (très cher), etc!.... C'est un petit paradis pour le caféïnomane... Et le thé! Environ 70 sortes de thé de tous genres, allant du Déjeuner Anglais à la Caravane Russe, passant par la multitude de thés blancs, verts, noirs, rooibos et tisanes...   On y sert aussi quelques repas, dont des déjeuners (oeufs, bacon, bagel, etc.), gâteaux, sorbets, gelato et autres gourmandises...  Une destination café à ne pas manquer si vous êtes dans les parages."}
{"text":"Hey hey ~ Finally a Coffee store that can make the Latte Foam leaf.  I went to 2 café/ bakerie (high class) and they couldn't do it. The café tastes good. The foam leaf got me so excited eheh. The atmosphere is nice. It's really calm.  I'd say it's a really good place to study. They provide Wifi too. Couple of streets away from Metro Mont-Royal.  Must give it a try!!!  yeye Foodlover"}
{"text":"Cozy place, especially in the fall or winter. One can be very productive here. I have completed several assignments here without feeling disturbed. The tables are great for working/writing. Plenty of natural night. Fabulous fair trade teas!  Years later is can use an update or new chairs..  Over all nice spot."}
{"text":"Mon café favori sur l'avenue Mont-Royal est. Autrefois le Porté disparu, on mange bien, le service et le café sont toujours excellents. Que de bons moments passés au début des années 90!"}
{"text":"In an excursion to find dessert after a dinner of poutine, we happened across this cute little cafe. I was looking for bagels and a place to sit after journeying across parc la fontaine. They have a great selection of desserts including gelato, cheese cake, bagels, as well as coffee and tea. I got the ferrero rocher cheese cake and plain sesame bagel. Both were amazing. The cake had a chocolate cookie crust, traditional cheese cake filling with nuts, and chocolate shavings as the topping. The sesame bagel was my only bagel in Montreal, and I thought it was great. Nicely toasted and slightly sweet. It also came with two small slices of fruit. The bagels were more expensive than St. Viateur, but we chose this place since they took cards and St. Viateur only does bagels for take out.   The menu is mostly in French, but pointing at the display does wonders. The waiter was also really nice. They gave us free tea with our order since it was in the evening."}
{"text":"Je garde un bon souvenir du Thé Roïboos latté! Après il est vrai que ce n'est pas non plus la place la plus confortable et cocoone dans laquelle j'ai pu mettre les pieds."}
{"text":"I really love the place, its cappuccino and desserts, specially the lemon cheesecake, is the best  I have tasted. It is not a noisy place perfect for enjoying a good company or book."}
{"text":"great place. very comfortable seating. fast free wifi. great coffee. excellent friendly service. nice relaxing music. food looks tasty."}
{"text":"I really wasn't impressed with this place. I don't think it's up to Plateau standards. There are far better places to grab a coffee and a sandwich within feet."}
{"text":"I came in here on a thursday afternoon trying to fight the heat wave with a friend, and I ended up staying til late evening.  The service was friendly and their ice café au lait was decent.   Coffee is on-par with other establishments in terms of price and the fact they had sorbet and gelato did peak my interest.  Plenty of tables around, and friendly atmosphere.  it was a bit on the louder side.  They had a huge variety of teas and beans in bulk.  I was hoping for more of an ambiance but the trade of for A/C was too high in demand!  The wifi was a bit slow but still fortunate enough to have it, and without staff giving me the eyeball. I tried their ice tea, which I didn't care for, but did have their grilled open-face baguette with swiss.   I guess I enjoy a unique atmosphere to help spark my creative bug, which lacked a bit, but then I realize I ask for a lot in that direction. Oh and for anglos and francos - happy with the bilingual-ness of the environment."}
{"text":"Cute little coffee shop we stumbled into while looking around for a good place to eat lunch. I ordered some kind of veggie sandwich with avocado, tomato, aioli, and cheese. It was pretty tasty. My boyfriend ordered a bagel with lox and enjoyed that as well.   Coffee was perfect.  Service was amazing. Shout out to the two ladies who made us feel welcome!"}
{"text":"Not a bad coffee spot for studying. I went here tonight to do some work and it was a quiet crowd. I ordered a medium coffee for 2.45 after tax. They only take debit or credit if you spend more than 3.00.  The coffee was good. However they can improve on cleanliness on both the cups and tables. I sat in a large community table by the door and there were leftover dishes and plates from the previous guests which wasn't taken away from me until 30 minutes before closing. Also, the first cup of coffee I got had a chip and it didn't felt like a clean cup.   I would be back to study myself, but there are definitely better coffee shops in the area."}
{"text":"On y entre, on y remarque : le vieux et beau plancher de  bois croche et rustique, la bonne odeur du café fraichement moulue ... et un sourire d'employé qui nous accueille. Grand choix de thés, cafés, cafés spéciaux... Bouffe simple, pas mal du tout (sandwich au thon et au poulet grillé ; mes favoris) ; bon désserts! Service irréprochable, sympathique ; l'endroit est beau, zen, confortable (plusieurs causeuses!) Très franchement, c'est l'un de mes cafés les plus agréables. Wi-Fi gratuit. L'ambiance est très chaleureuse et la clientèle simple ; on ne s'y prend pas la tête."}
{"text":"Sympathique petit café sur le plateau. Pas tres grand mais il compte néanmoins pas mal de tables et donc de places mais évidemment il faut accepter d'être assis a côté d'étrangers, en effet, on ne va pas dans ce café pour son côté intime. Cela n'est pourtant pas dérangeant ni bruyant.  On y trouve un vaste choix de cafés biologiaues en provenance de divers endroits du monde et on peut choisir son intensité.  Le Café Expression propose aussi différentes petites restaurations sucrées ou salées mais malheureusement rien de vegan pour l'instant.  L'ambiance est correcte, le café bon et les prix raisonnables"}
{"text":"Coffee is OK, but not amazing.  Nice enough ambiance.  Free wireless is nice.  Nice, quiet place to work."}
{"text":"I wrote most of my book here day-in-and-day-out for several summers. I love this place and consider it my home-away-from-home office. The coffee is good, the food is delicious (esp the Florentine crêpes), the WiFi is stable, tables are comfortable, and the staff are nice and never pressure you to leave. I can't recommend it highly enough."}
{"text":"Café tranquille avec du personnel super accueillant ! Plusieurs prises pour ordinateurs et beaucoup de sièges ! Pour ne pas avoir été très aventureuse dans la nourriture, la salade de poids chiches est excellente et le café aussi. Super pour une séance étude !"}
{"text":"J'y vais pour leur chaï latté, qui est tout simplement délicieux ! C'est aussi le café idéal pour étudier de longues heures : beaucoup de place, éclairage adéquat, pas trop bruyant... Parfait pour la fin de session."}
{"text":"Hands down one of the best spots to study, write or work on the Plateau.Why is that so? Glad you asked.  1) Even when the place is packed, it still manages to feel quiet. Neither the music nor the conversations are too loud or distracting, so you can hear yourself think. 2) Their opening hours are fantastic: 8am to 10pm, everyday. 3) The staff is always suuuper nice, smiling and patient. 4) The communal table next to the window is awesome for team meetings. There's a couple powerbars underneath it to charge your laptop. Keep that in mind, because there are very few sockets around the coffeeshop.  That being said, the coffee is only decent in my opinion, and from what I've had so far, the food is nothing special either. I always get a filter coffee when I work here, because it's cheap and they have several fairtrade options. Bottom line is: this is not the place to come to if you just want a coffee to go. However, if you plan on staying for a while, to read a nice book perhaps or enjoy the free wifi, then you'd be hard-pressed to find a safer bet."}
{"text":"Les croissants faits sur place sont délicieux! De même pour les potages et les paninis (qui sont toutefois assez dispendieux).  Malgré le nombre grandissant de places assises, le café est souvent plein à craquer. On peut quand même trouver des moments tranquilles durant la semaine (comme en ce moment, un vendredi soir).  Les employées sont toujours très gentilles et sympathiques. Si vous avez un portable, prenez garde, il y a très peu de prises de courant! (seulement à l'avant et l'arrière du café)"}
