{"text":"Went for Riggs Tap Takeover, everything was great! Their beer-battered Fried mushrooms were the best I had eaten in awhile. Our server seemed a little stretched thin, which I thought was odd since they were not that busy. Other than that, no complaints."}
{"text":"This place frequently mails out coupons to the local area, so I had been looking forward to it for a while. The first thing you notice when you step in is the numerous large-screen TVs. There was nothing interesting showing when I came, but I imagine this would be a great place to watch major sports events like NFL games and the NCAA basketball tournament. The restaurant is located within a nice clubhouse, so the place is clean, well-lit, and pretty spacious. In terms of atmosphere and setting, there's nothing to complain about at all.  The problems I had were with the food. To start, the water had funny taste to it. Moving on to the nachos, the ratio of ingredients didn't impress me. They overdo the cheese, and skimp on the pico de gallo. The cheese is melted, but the chips are cold. The wings weren't great, being both small and overly fried. But they're just 40 cents each on Sunday so they're still not a bad deal. I wouldn't order these on any other day of the week though. Sandwich wasn't bad, but took a really long time to arrive. We're talking ~45 minutes at 11 AM on a Sunday. For a sandwich and fries.  I'll probably go back again to give the place a second chance, but I wouldn't do it without more coupons. My score breakdown looks something like this: 5/5 for the atmosphere, 2/5 for the food, 2/5 for the slow service, 3/5 overall."}
{"text":"Poor service and we won't be back. We've tried this place a number of times in the past and each time I swore I would never return. My husband convinced me to go again because several of our friends wanted to go there for drinks. The good news is I will never have to try it again. We had the worst service possible - and we were only there for drinks, and the place wasn't busy! Over 2 hours and we were served 3 times. Really? Some of our group had planned to stay for dinner, but decided against it after waiting forever on drinks - and it was beer, wine (which is horribly underpoured), and 1 Captain and diet each round. How hard is that to fix? When we arrived there were maybe 5-6 patrons besides our group of 7. It still wasn't busy by the time we left. This is a beautiful building located in a nice setting (overlooking a golf course) but somebody needs to take a good, hard look at how to make this place a go, because whatever they're doing now isn't working."}
{"text":"The food is OK and the decor is very nice.  It is very clean too.  I have booked events here in the past and had a pretty good experience but the last time I had event here was just awful.  It was not so much the food but the person who helped me plan the event from Attie's.  She was extremely rude to me in front of everyone and instead of trying to solve the problem she got extremely defensive.  Everyone made a comment that she was out of line and unprofessional.  Too bad.  It's a nice venue but I probably would never go back again."}
{"text":"This place used to be very nice. Not now though. Evidently they changed managers and chef. The other manager always made sure everything was running smoothly. The original chef would come out and talk to the customers.   I'm sitting here and can't get waited on.....  Now I'm not sure I'll be back.  PS: I just asked the waitress and sure enough...new management. Why can't businesses leave well enough alone?"}
{"text":"I had never heard of Atties, but my boyfriend recommended it since he had been here before. I loved it! We sat outside and could watch the golfers. We were greeted immediately upon arrival, seated quickly, and our server Kat was prompt and attentive. We had drinks immediately after. We had the Riggs battered mushrooms....a must have!!! I also had the french onion soup with its puff pastry topping, and the gourmet grilled chese. I couldn't stop eating any of it. Soo good!!  He had the buffalo chicken wrap and he gave it 2 thumbs up as well.  All in all, such a great sunday lunch. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Worst service ever.  We left after none of the 6 waitresses milling about would deign to stop over and take our order."}
{"text":"Service was slow and Food was terrible.  Po' boy sandwich was cold...ordered chili that I never got and had to have the bill fixed twice.  All 4 adults didn't like their meals.  Will never go back."}
{"text":"We drive by Stone Creek on the way to and from work and finally decided to give Attie's a try.   The atmosphere was good and not too loud for a bar/restaurant combo (though we were there relatively early, 4:30ish in the afternoon).    The reuben was excellent.  The fries were ho-hum and need to be kicked up a notch somehow.  We will try a different side dish next time around.   The service was outstanding.  Seating was a little too close for my tastes, next time we will request an out of the way table so folks wanting good TV viewing seats aren't crammed in next to us.  Cost per person was very reasonable, we WILL be back!"}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised by their menu offerings. I want to return and try a few things. Nice variety of salads, sandwiches, burgers and entr√©es to try."}
{"text":"Fun place!  Kids eat free Wednesday.  Great appetizers,  great food, great service.  Sports bar like feel with upscale food.  Fantastic prices.  Blue chease chips are a must!"}
{"text":"More people need to know about this place.  The atmosphere was great, the food was tasty, and the service was outstanding.  The menu consists of sandwiches, burgers, wraps, and salads.  I know, the menu sounds pretty basic, but they do a great job with it.  They also have a great alcohol menu.  I had a few martinis that were pretty tasty.  Their beer selection is modest, but it does include a respectful number of craft selections.  The service was prompt and friendly.  There is really nothing more to say about this.  Live music!  Yes, this place has live music on Thursday, Friday, and Saturday nights.  No, it isn't that live music that drowns out conversation.  The volume is at the perfect level and the entertainment can actually sing.  In fact, the guy on the night we went was hands down better than anything I've heard in Champaign/Urbana.  It was unfortunate that there were only six or so tables of patrons on the night we went.  It is on a golf course and it was a cold night so that might have had something to do with it.  I will definitely be back and recommend Attie's to others."}
{"text":"Service was seamless. We were seated at the same time as two 4 tops and a party of 8 that arrived at the same time as my wife and I. Had no problem with getting our food. That was delicious. Warm and welcoming experience. Will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"A decent little bar and grill attached to Stone Creek.  A long L granite top bar, booths and high top tables.  Lots of TV's, a larger dining area to the right of the bar.  A bit generic, but comfortable.  The bartenders are friendly and on top of things.  A handful of taps, some good micros like Ballast Point and Dogfish Head.  The requisite Macros and a full bar as well.  All things to all people on the booze front.  They have a good reuben sandwich, and some specials every once in a while.  The pork tenderloin sandwich was decent, nothing special.  Overall, a nice spot to drink with slightly generic vibe and pub grub.  Not bad as a neighborhood joint, or for a drink after a round of golf."}
{"text":"Sweating was prompt. 7pm Saturday night. Room is half full. Music to a dull roar. Not too loud. Lighting is easy on the eyes.   Waitress is attentive to start. She had recommendations. We ordered beer and appetizers.  Appetizer was the blue cheese chips. Not much flavor. Needed more seasoning. The other was the lime shrimp cocktail. It's warm which is weird. Good flavor though.   Menu is burgers, wraps, salads (like ten different kinds), and grill items. Also have a gluten free menu that is a pick a protein and two veggies for 13.99 (steak salmon or chicken). Had the chicken, not a $14 meal but now I don't feel bad about what I ate.   Molly had the chicken cease salad wrap. She took half home and claims it was good. Also got fries. She says they had steak seasoning on them.   Service was fast and attentive. We were in and out in under an hour.   Many tv screens and a few craft beers."}
{"text":"Have eaten there several times and it seems to be the same issue over and over I had the bacon and blue cheese burger which is a dry aged half pound cheeseburger that the bottom bun was so soaked in grease you couldn't tell it was there the Hamburger had no real flavor to it as far as the meat goes all you could taste was condiments my companion always orders the buffalo chicken wrap and it is so inconsistent that this time it was so hot that she couldn't even eat it even after pouring several containers of ranch dressing over the top of it to cool it off they really need to work on their consistency and flavors before I will go back I mean really $14 for a hamburger and you get a greasy bun with a sandwich that has no flavor I think McDonald's is got them beat."}
