{"text":"Large portions, fresh ingredients friendly staff. Great for take out or dine in (restaurant is more take out oriented, not conducive for dine in large groups)"}
{"text":"I order take out here frequently and it's consistently good.  I appreciate the fact that they always get my order right and have it ready in minutes no matter how crazy it is.  As a side note, they accidently overcharged me once and when they realized it, brought it to my attention to refund the difference.  I never would have noticed (it was only a couple dollars) but they made a point to make it right."}
{"text":"Cheapest Asian food you can find and minimal stomach aches - no complaints! Staff is very fast and friendly."}
{"text":"HIGHS: Very large portions, crisp/tender veggies, extra sticky rice, tasty/smoky pork, perfectly cooked shrimp, yummy crab rangoon.  Called in my order, and it was ready in 5 minutes.  I'm definitely a fan.    LOWS: I do wish their beef and chicken were more tender, but it is still tasty.  My new go-to Chinese takeout.  :)"}
{"text":"The food is not up to par with China Best next door. The people are also very rude. I will not be going back to this establishment.. I had to throw away half of what I bought."}
{"text":"Ordered fried shrimp from Panda hut. What once was well cooked larger butterfly shrimp are now tiny greasy popcorn shrimp! I was so disappointed, especially since I was starving and had my mouth set on crunchy hot shrimp and not the soggy tiny shrimp I got instead. What are you doing Panda Hut?! And where are the crunchy golden fried shrimp you had in the past? Based on this experience I don't think I'll be back."}
{"text":"I go here all the time and today I have never been treated with less respect. My order was wrong and they claimed they couldn't hear me on the phone. They almost did not remake it and then told me it was my fault even after I purchased extra sauces and soda and waited on my food which should have been ready. They literally yelled that me. I told them obviously my business wasn't welcome and I would not be coming back. They clearly don't care about their customer image and only about money. It's truly a shame."}
{"text":"Extremely average Chinese food and price to match.  As other reviewers mention designed for take out the interior is not kept up nor does anyone seem to care that there are chair gouges in the wall.  Yes large food portions if that is what you care about."}
{"text":"The first couple of times we are here it was amazing! However the last two times left a lot to be desired. The portions are definitely a bonus, but I prefer quality over quantity. I can't say we won't give them another try, but I sure hope their food will return to tasting like it did when we first started going."}
{"text":"How this place has 4 stars at the time of this review is beyond me. Got three simple dishes on Friday you know for a Friday night in, chicken fried rice, well that was not even close to being fried golden chicken no white like it was boiled! Add to there being 6 strips of chicken in that and the rice was stodgy! Schezuen beef yep no more than 7 pieces of meat awful and the general tsos my god I don't know what the point was just should have been batter with flavor. Really poor my advice drive up the road to what was Shia bistro now rainbow never had anything bad there and the people are friendly too. Sorry but avoid this place"}
{"text":"I do not recommend this place. We are strict vegetarians and wether people agree or not, it is irresponsible to add pork to a vegetarian order. Immediately upon calling and voicing my concern, proceeded to tell me that it was a carrot (I am a freaking vegetarian, I know what a carrot looks like) and hanged up on me. When I asked for a refund for the Lo Mein, they demanded we brought the food along with the receipt back to the store. It was their mess up, why would I need to drive my extremely pregnant self 25 minutes back to them. It's Ok, called my bank and they will be canceling that payment. As far as I am concerned this is a horrible establishment. In addition, their fried rice is just white rice with a bit of soy sauce. Will never be back, they lost the business from a family of 8."}
{"text":"Ordered the fried shrimp which were tiny shrimps covered in mounds of batter. Not to say, the shrimp were dry and it does not come with any dipping sauces unless you want to pay $1 for the Japanese shrimp sauce. What? lol I did not even finished half of it and just threw it out."}
{"text":"Great little take out joint.  There is a limited amount of indoor seating too.  Be prepared to wait a little extra during the weekday lunch rush.  I haven't had any major problems.  One time I ordered chicken egg foo yung but received shrimp instead.  I called the location to let them know and they told me if I wanted a replacement I would have to bring in the food along with the receipt.  I didn't feel like driving back during evening rush hour so I returned the next day with the food and receipt and the young lady behind the counter told me she couldn't help me and didn't offer a reason why.  The fried rice is boring and mostly white rice with soy sauce.  Portions are large and a great value for the money.  The fried items have a lot of additional breading.  The shrimp are small but look large because they're mostly breading."}
{"text":"Great take out Chinese! The family pack is a really awesome value. We got the chicken lo mien and honey chicken. Both were significantly better than most takeout places I've tried recently.   Definitely recommend for a quick dinner in the area!"}
{"text":"Ordered a regular sized cashew chicken, sea same chicken, and a small order or crab Rangoon. All were delicious. Portions were huge!"}
{"text":"Consistently good food for a great price.  I'm a huge fan of the orange chicken and my husband tries something new every time.  Highly recommend."}
