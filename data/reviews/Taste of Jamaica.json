{"text":"The new location is east of the Richmond and Mayfield rd intersection.  The food was solid, tried Beef Patty, goat curry, and jerk chicken.  Portions were generous and takes credit cards."}
{"text":"New location is in Lyndhurst on the corner of Richmond & Mayfield Rd."}
{"text":"So you may drive past this place without appreciating there's a tremendous ethnic scene inside. Fortunately, if you have a taste for Jamaican or never had some supposedly authentic fare, this place is awesome. I also had the jerk chicken, large (really good size) which included 3 chicken breasts/wings that were well seasoned in the spicy jerk sauce, huge serving of brown rice with some bbq-style sauce on top, plus some rediculous mixed cabbage mix.

The atmosphere was simple but cool. Three guys with thick jamaican accents, accepting cash only, have a slew of made-in-jamaica sodas in the fridge and work listening to some cultural music overhead. Not many seats, like 7 or so, so take out or maybe you'll get lucky, but 3 of us at prime lunch time didnt have an issue. 

Would love to go back to this place as I left both satisfied and happy, and plan to try the BBQ jerk chicken special that's available on tuesday. Oxtail and fried plantanes are also on my list. Either way, you can't go wrong with this place and for 10 bucks, you'll be very happy getting a real taste of jamaica."}
{"text":"This place is great. Good, consistent food. Fairly fast service. Nice sized portions for price. Family run. thick jamaican accents. random neighborhood conversations. They run out of food items occasionally, but even when they only had one item left and i tried it, the fish filet i think, it was still really good. Just get there earlier in the day to get the full selection."}
{"text":"Great concept but please be careful of what you order.    The empanadas style beef pockets are loaded with excellent tasting meat but the shell could be improved.   The rice and beans are good.  Plantains are awful and the dumplings are worse.  
The jerk chicken has very good spicy flavor but the cut of the chicken itself reminds me of what I would find in rural China with plenty of bones to work through.  I also had the side of cabbage which was excellent.  
You could eat in at one of their tables but bring headphones because the acoustics are real loud!  The setting is more in tune with take out.  It would not be comfortable to eat there."}
{"text":"Best jerk chicken and goat curry between here and Toronto since that's the closest neighborhood I know of with a high Caribbean population. The portions are large, their beef patties are an out of this world!"}
{"text":"Called to place order because I was in a hurry but they said they don't take orders over the phone so went in ordered, waited forever for my food while multiple people the owner knew walked in and ordered after me but then got there food before me, the owner allows his favoritism of certain customers effect the experience of other customers. The jerk chicken is all bone barely any chicken (like backbone the stuff most places disregard) and I've heard that same complaint from other people as well. The goat curry is the same way, honestly has good flavor but majorly lacking in execution, all bone, not sure where he gets his goat from but they seem malnourished, no meat, he should hit up the westside market I get great meaty goat from there. I used to frequent multiple different Jamaican restaurants when I lived in Florida and this place doesn't hold a candle to any of them. I will never be back......"}
{"text":"This was my first experience at Taste of Jamaica. I requested the Large size oxtail with cabbage and fried plantains. I was told that I could not order two vegetables as sides and that one of the sides has to be rice. That is not written on their website or on their menu. It simply states pick two sides. They were out of plantain. Also, I had to wait 20 minutes for them to make the rice and beans that wasn't my preference only for them to taste scorched. The gravy for the oxtails just was regular brown gravy and nothing special. You should really allow people to call in orders if your wait time is more than 5 minutes.I was just not impressed."}
{"text":"Got there about 7:15. Ordered the large jerk chicken (wanted a chicken patty but they were out). Extremely quick  service. Chicken was chopped when I ordered it. Comes with healthy helpings of rice and beans and cabbage.  $10 - cash only. Pretty much take out only (I probably would not eat there)

The food was AWESOME. My first real experience with traditional Jamaican food but the flavors were great. Chicken was moist, tender and spicy. Rice and beans perfectly cooked and tasty. Cabbage was delicious. Also a ton of food. Probably enough for 2 people to share. 

All in all great meal for a very reasonable price. Will definitely go back (probably earlier next time) to try some of the other dishes."}
{"text":"I was craving something different so I decided on Jamaican. After reading the   Yelp reviews I chose to try this place. The sign on the door said they opened at noon. But it was 5 after and the door was locked. I saw the cooks and they saw me. They gestured that they'd be open in another 10 minutes. A small crowd of  customers a had gathered outside the door.  Finally, once inside. I'd say its a smaller order your food to go type place with reggae coming through the speakers. Not much in the way yo seating options. Buts it doable with maybe 3 small tables and some chairs along the wall. I ordered the large jerk chicken and a beef meat pie. The portions in the jerk chicken combo ( cabbage, rice) were plentiful. The chicken was just a little dry but I don't know if it was supposed to be that way or not. I'll have to compare it the next time I go there or when I visit another Jamaican place. Overall, the food was good and I enjoyed my order. I'd recommend it as a place to try."}
{"text":"Love this place, simply love it! My husband and I have been going here for the last six years. One day we up and wanted to have Jamaican cuisine so we did a search in our area and found this place. We are so glad we found it. I normally get the jerk chicken & my husband gets the curry chicken, both comes with rice/beans and cabbage. Both are excellent choices. While these are our go to choices, we have basically tried everything on the menu over time and all were tasty. We also love the patties, love them. The one and only thing we dislike about this place is they run out of  food fast and there are times we can't get what we really want. I do understand that this place has a high turnover food rate, but it is sometimes disappointing to get there and they not have what you want. This is definitely the best Jamaican cuisine in Cleveland!!! You want to go and give it a try, trust me!!! Just a little advice, it is cash only and is basically a takeout."}
{"text":"I have to say I was very impressed with their chicken and rice combo with beans.Dont forget to ask for gravy on ur chicken,  makes all the difference. The only drawback is there is usually a long line and when u try to go during your lunch break, you only have 5 minutes left to eat but it is very tasty and nice people there."}
{"text":"Great flavor and you get alot for the price. I ordered the jerk chicken with the rice and beans and cabbage. I was disappointed they didn't have any plaintains, but its' only a reason to make me go back again. I was shocked when I got home to have so much white meat, usually most restaurants I've been to serve thighs and legs only, so that was a pleasant surprise. The place is pretty small, so a to go order is best. Also be warned they only accept cash. I had to leave and go to the bank up the street, so be sure to bring cash!"}
{"text":"Excellent jerk chicken. It will not disappoint.  I got the rice and beans and it could feed a family!"}
{"text":"Taste of Jamaica was a welcome treat for our family.  We had jerk chicken, rice and peas (beans), suateed cabbage, fried plantains, beef patties, chicken curry patties and Ting.  Thumbs up on everything!  I wanted to try the escovitch red snapper but they were out.  The restaurant was clean and busy.  The young woman who took my order was friendly and 

 We will be back!"}
{"text":"Great eats.  Walk in, observe the dry erase board for that day's selections, and the guy behind the counter will serve it up.  Massive portions even for the \"small size\" which, for the cheap at heart, is only $8 for an entree and side of beans and rice and cabbage.  The jerk chicken is outstanding.  It is carved when you order it (bones and all...so watch your chompers when eating).  Nice heat on the jerk chicken.  Brown stew is chicken based and delicious.  They were out of fried plantains so I was bummed.  CASH ONLY, MON."}
{"text":"The place said it opens at 12, but didn't open until 12:15. The place is always out of something. The food taste good, and the people are nice"}
{"text":"Wack as hell red beans & rice with super salty ox tail gravy!  They have the nerve to charge 50Â¢ extra for the gravy"}
{"text":"During our long journey through the food desert seen by our growling stomachs, we happened upon Taste of Jamaica. It was everything we had hoped for and more! I have never been to Jamaica, so I don't know what \"authentic\" Jamaican food is, but this is the closest thing to \"authentic\" Jamaican food that you will find in all of Cleveland. It's definitely what you can call a \"hole in the wall\", but it is actually more like a gem in a mountain of rocks. The flavors I have experienced here are unlike anything I have ever tasted. My taste buds were in heaven. You can't go wrong ordering Jamaican chicken here. My husband ordered the goat stew. The meat was super tender, juicy, and fell right off the bone."}
{"text":"A big departure from the every day meal option. If you want to save $2000 don't go to Jamaica go to Mayfield & Richmond and have a fantastic meal for $10 bucks.

The tastes are exceptional, outstanding ingredients. The mix of flavors are amazing could not recommend it stronger. Taste of Jamaica is better than many restaurants that are several times more expensive; go to this place man! 

They did a great job in redoing the restaurant and moving to this location."}
{"text":"I've always seen pictures of food from this place and vowed I'd go check it out someday. That day finally came ! And overall it was fantastic. They serve huge portions that met what you pay in price which are very reasonable as well. Pictured below are three different type of dinners, jerk chicken, curry chicken and ox tail.!my favorite by far was the jerk chicken. As avid spicy food goer, I must say I would always tend to lean towards the spicier dish. However, this is definitely up there with some of best jerk chicken I've had. This place and a place called Pineapple Eddies in Erie Pa are definitely type two on my list for jerk chicken. Overall all three meals were great and I'll definitely advise any whose wants something new or Jamaican cuisine to stop by!"}
{"text":"Idk I go to island cusine on harvard across from southpointe hospital I go about twice a week! I haven't had any island food better!  The jerk chicken is on point the brown stew and you get your money worth! 10$ 8$ and even a 5$ box I say 3 people can eat off a 10$ box!"}
{"text":"Who knew there's authentic Jamaican food in northeast Ohio?! I would definitely consider this place a carry-out, as the restaurant is very small, just a couple high top tables. The menu is pretty large and pretty traditional. They have a lot of dishes that I remember from my trips to Jamaica. I was especially happy that they had patties- kind of like a much more delicious hot pocket filled with beef, curried chicken, or veggies. 
We ordered the jerk chicken, the oxtail, and a couple patties. The portions are huge!! The large option, which comes with rice and veggies, is definitely big enough for two meals. The oxtail was awesome. Be forewarned that oxtail is very fatty and boney, but that's just the nature of the dish. The oxtail meat was so tender and delicious, it seriously brought me back to the island. 
The jerk chicken was a little subpar to what I was expecting. It just wasn't as spicy as what i wanted, much sweeter. But the chicken itself was very juicy and who am I kidding- we still ate it all. 
The best part of the meal was the patties. If you've never had a Jamaican patty, definitely try them here. They were awesome. 
Just an FYI, they are cash only. The nice man at the counter let us know that right away and also told us there's an ATM right next door. They also sell out of their popular items fairly early. We got there at 2pm, only two hours after they had opened and about 1/3 of the menu was gone. I'll just definitely get there earlier next time."}
{"text":"Got the jerk chicken. Solid. Hands down would come here again. They were out of barbecue otherwise I would have gotten that. Jerk chicken wasn't really as spicy as I've had before and as I like it...but still, solid for the $. Flavorful and filling. Really hit the spot.

Some notes: 
1) This is really a take out spot. Don't expect to sit down and eat.
2) Cash only, Small $8/ Large $10
3) There is a parking lot."}
{"text":"I stopped here randomly as I was biking and what a treat!   The place only accepts cash, but the Jamaican food was excellent!  The server recommended the special, Jerk BBQ chicken, and I am glad to followed his advice.    I ordered a \"small\" which was a liberal portion of chicken served with dirty rice and veggies.  While there are only 3 small tables, I highly recommend you stop in and check out their food."}
{"text":"Hidden gem,  but worth the drive to get authentic Caribbean cuisine in and awesome seating atmosphere...  The jerk chicken, the curry goat soooooooooooo freaking good..  I grew up in Bklyn NY,  so I can certify this is as authentic as you can get it in the Cleveland area"}
{"text":"This was my first time here and I am now a fan!   I ordered 2 large dinners, jerk chicken with white rice and cabbage for my hubby and stew chicken with rice & beans and cabbage for myself.  I also ordered a beef patty.  I really wanted plantains, as well, but they were out.   There is a handwritten menu posted on the wall, as you enter with a check mark or an \"x\" based on what's available.   I had planned to get the curry chicken for myself, but the customer before me ordered the stew chicken and it looked tasty, and sure enough it was!!!!   The portions were huge, definitely enough to share or for leftovers.   The meals were only $10 each and the beef patty was $2.50.  I ate the beef patty on the way home, in the car, and it was spicy but GOOD.  The ratio of crust to filling was perfect.  The patty was warm and delicious, almost a meal by itself.   My husband loved his entree and the stew chicken is now my favorite.  The meat was tender and juicy and the sauce was savory and tasty.   I will definitely return!"}
{"text":"As far as the taste of the food, this is one of the best West Indian restaurants that I've gone to and I've been to countless! My only reason for giving them 4 stars is because they run out of food too fast. It's been times that I've gone here 3 hours after they open and more than half of the menu is unavailable. Also it's 2015 and they still don't take credit/debit cards! Ugh!"}
{"text":"Very delicious, but sometimes have ran out of certain food options. Wish they had a larger menu. I'm looking forward to their Caribbean pizzas that are expected to hit the menu this summer!"}
{"text":"Have you ever had a taste for something so bad? You drive miles to calm your craving, only to find that its no longer in stock or they ran out? This is a common occurance at Taste of Jamaica. I've experienced this plenty of times at their old location and now the new one. Now, this could be a good thing! Maybe it just means the food is so delicious that people order so much of it and it's hard to keep stocked.  Either way, i walked out of there pretty bummed."}
{"text":"Got the jerk chicken with rice and beans and steamed cabbage. Food was incredibly flavorful. Beef patties are on point. I will definitely return!"}
{"text":"Took the reviewers' advice and had the jeek chicken, rice and peas and cabbage.  All were very, very tasty.  The chicken is wuite spicy and not for the faint of heart!  Smoky and flavorful.  Some of the best jerk chicken I've ever had. 

It opens at noon and the curry goat and stew fish weren't ready yet so if you want those you may want to wait until 12:30 or so.

My only complaint was that the rice and beans was a liitle too salty for my taste.  YMMV.  I might've taken away a star for this but everything else was so good I'm giving five!  Plus this is obviously a small independently run place and the food is batch made from scratch.

The guys who run the place are friendly and the food comes up fast.  

I will definitely be back!

Chris"}
{"text":"The food tasted better when the were in the little store front in Cleveland Heights. Not impressed with the food at this new location"}
{"text":"I have been meaning to try Taste of Jamaica for a while, tried last week but they were close to closing and wouldn't make any shrimp.   Since the power was out at home, I figured I would give it a try.  

Located in a strip of stores at the intersection of Mayfield and Richmond Roads, TOJ is a clean little shop with a bit of the island feel.  Casual with reggae music playing it could be a cool place to hang.  You come in and order at the counter at the back, the menu is up on video screens.  I was a bit surprised when I asked about the Jerk Shrimp and was told that they don't make it.  I ended up ordering the Curry Shrimp with the rice and beans and a side of cabbage.  I also asked about a cup of water and was told that they don't have any cups.

After about a 15 minute wait, the food came up, you have to pick it up at the counter and it is packed in styrofoam to go, even if you are eating in.  For $13 I got 10 good sized shrimp, a large portion of rice and cabbage.  The food I got was good and well prepared, but while the flavors were nice, there was a lack of sizzle.  I love the food at Bratenhal Kitchen and found that TOJ just didn't have the same kind of flavors.  It was good, but not great. 

My opinion of Taste of Jamaica is that it is a nice place with decent food, but if I want Jamaican food I have a better option which is a bit further, but I am willing to take the extra time for more flavor."}
{"text":"Definitely recommend the jerk chicken (has a bit of a kick to it) paired with the rice and beans (deliciously fragrant). The fried plantains with its subtle sweetness provided a perfect balance. Portions were sizeable! (shareable between two)"}
{"text":"The curry chicken was amazing- so flavorful and tender. Friend plantains, cabbage and red beans & rice were on point. Very large portions and quick service! There was no line."}
{"text":"AMAZING. I looove this place. 

This place is tiny, it's basically a counter where you order and has maybe 3 seats inside.  But most people just order to go here--super fast service.  They have a white board with what they have for the day and it tells you if they've run out of anything.  As a warning, they generally run out of food pretty quickly. And at the end of the day if they're out of food, they just close up early! If you come for lunch when they open (around 11:30am I think) you should be good to go.  We've picked up food for dinner on weekdays at 7 and been able to get food but they've usually run out of some dishes. 

I usually get a small order of the jerk chicken (comes with rice and a side of veggies) with extra sauce on the rice and it's more than enough food. Portions are big here and at only $8 for the small!  The jerk chicken is on the spicy side for those of you with a sensitive palate.  I've also gotten the oxtail which is also awesome ($10 for the small), but if you want bang for your buck they pile on the meat for the jerk chicken.  I've tasted the different stews they have when my friends have ordered it and pretty much everything is delicious.  I've heard amazing things about their fried plaintains but have never gotten to try it because they always run out of it by the time I go--one day I'll get 'em!

Just go.  You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"We had the escovitch snapper, curry shrimp, oxtail stew and jerk bbq chicken. We also bought a meat patty and a curry chicken patty. We loved and would recommend absolutely all of it. The snapper was delicious with just a hint of tartness from the vinegar and even better with a piece of fried plantain and spoonful of stewed cabbage. The spice was honestly perfect for us on everything- though I know spice is  relative to each diner. And the curry...omgosh....was pretty much the yummiest curry I've had to date- in any restaurant, anywhere. 
I can't say enough about the customer service either. 
Just remember it is a take out restaurant and if you want a special item like the escovitch snapper, you will have to wait several minutes as it's cooked to order, but I promise you it's worth it. We will absolutely eat from here again and can't wait to try the daily specials. 
As for the naysayers....Not sure how there could be any bad reviews of this place, all I can say is that maybe those that weren't happy should give it another try? 
My guess is they'd be more than pleasantly surprised."}
{"text":"My husband and I went here for our anniversary looking for some island food ...we were disappointed at the long wait for our food nearly 25 minutes as well as the lack of taste. This food tasted like it was watered down it was not at all seasoned and the way we are used to Jamaican food tasting and it was very disappointing. When you go to a Jamaican place you're expecting a certain taste that transports you to the islands . The food should be authentically seasoned and flavorful and not catered to some who may not like spicy or seasoned food. If I wanted bland food I would have went to Cracker Barrel or Bob Evans... I wish I could've gotten my money and just went home and cooked a good flavorful meal... this was a fail on their part"}
{"text":"Today was my second visit and I'm just as pleased as the first. To start, make sure you bring cash!!!! They do not accept cards. This may be the only downfall. Also, there's only 2-3 tables for dining in (with 2 seats at each table) so you may want to get your food to go. 

The food is very fresh and authentic. I actually watched them cutting some cabbage and basting whole fresh fish while I was there. It's all made from scratch and you can watch the cooks while they prepare the food. It may be a small storefront but i was pleased with the quality of the food. 

Between my two trips I tasted the oxtails, jerk chicken, and stewed chicken. All of them were amazing. The stewed chicken was my favorite. All the meals come with traditional peas and rice and cabbage. You can also do white rice if you prefer. My family adored their meals. The meals are priced well and the portions are large. A small meal is around $8-10 while a large meal is $10-13. Make sure you grab a kola champagne and a beef (or chicken) patty as well. I got a ton of food and my bill was less than $15. This place will be a regular of mine."}
{"text":"Fantastic experience! Grew up in South Florida, surrounded by Jamaican restaurants, and I go to Jamaica quite often. This place is as authentic as you can find. Perfect size menu, nice people, very clean, amazing flavor, and reasonable prices!!! I had the Oxtail with rice&beans and cabbage! It was fantastic and the \"small\" portion was huge! My wife had a chicken patty and the fried plantains, and we both loved everything. Very good quality food and products. They also have different sodas from Jamaica including Ginger Beer. 
We will be definitely coming back here. Everything you could ask for in a first visit!!!"}
{"text":"Good Jamaican food, the jerk chicken is nice and spicy- not salty like some places. Go early! They run out of EVERYTHING FAST- when we arrived two hours before closing on a Saturday all the food on the menu was sold out except their jerk chicken- which they'd just finished making fresh."}
{"text":"This is a place for displaced Jamaican single men and locals. The food is tasty, truely a taste of Jamaica,  but not the full flavor experience I have encountered in other city where Jamaicans have a more substantial presence. Or from female friends from the Caribbean. I will definitely go back, my favorite curry goat was unavailable.  Just moved to the neighborhood so it's good to have that close with Jamaican food as my favorite cuisine, and I am a single girl loving the flirtatious banter with staff and patrons."}
{"text":"Drove all the way from Canton and they were not open. On a day they advertised that they were. SMDH. I wasted gas and time. Good thing i found a waaay better substitute on Harvard ave. Never Ever will i go back!"}
{"text":"the best in cleveland hands down the best curry very authentic taste get there early the good  stuff doesn't last long. i havent been to the new location but im looking forward to going soon."}
{"text":"If you want \"fast food\" that is like a good home cooked meal this is the place for you. So far I have tried the fried plantains, chicken meat pie, beef meat pie, curry chicken, jerk chicken and oxtails. Prices are great and what can i say about the atmosphere? Lets just say I was trying  to place my order while not trying to sing along to Sizzla Kalonji's \"Just One Of Those Days\" that was playing overhead. 

FYI - closed on Sunday and Monday and only allows called in orders for the steamed fish."}
{"text":"This place serves one of the best chicken dishes I've ever had from a takeout restaurant.  I ordered a large jerk chicken platter with a beef patty on the side.  The large jerk chicken is big enough for 2 people to share for lunch.  Alongside the chicken is a very generous portion of rice and beans and sauteed cabbage.  The sides are very tasty and can be ordered a la carte for $3.00-$3.50.  Chopped immediately before serving, the chicken was juicy and well seasoned.  Everything is moderately spicy.

The beef patty was also tasty and fresh.  It's not actually a patty, but more like a meat turnover.  I liked the jerk chicken better, but the beef patty is tasty and cheap.  There are other varieties of chicken on the menu (curry, stew).  I also saw a lot of goat items and fish items that I would try in the future.

A lot of the menu items were not available when I went.  This just gives me a reason to go back another time to try some of the other dishes."}
{"text":"Taste of jamaica was a pleasent suprise. The aesthetics were on point as well as the reggae playlist. I ordered the oxtail combo with red beans rice and plantains which was delicious. My lover ordered the jerk chicken combo with the same sides, which she enjoyed. The plantains weren't to my liking, however they still had an authentic taste. Fast friendly service always earns you return customers. 4 stars."}
{"text":"Have eaten here twice in one  week and very impressed!

I did the jerk chicken without the sauce/ gravy they offer. Very good! And honestly spicy. It burned my lips a little and that's a GREAT sign! On second visit had the jerk chicken again--just as good or better--and tried the oxtail.
The SMALL order of oxtail ($10) I thought was a very generous portion of food and came with a few dumpling.
Had the red pea soup; good but could have been more spicy.

Owners are professional/accommodating and even noted they could take special orders/ cater with a few days advance notice.

Menu is pretty diverse and included fish, cowfoot etc. although I don't think they have every dish every day."}
{"text":"I walked out after the woman explained curry as \"the yellow gravy\". Needless to say, I will not be going back.."}
{"text":"Firstly, the atmosphere is great, but that's all.
I ordered the oxtail dinner, two of them, one small and one large, total cost  $24.
The food was not authentic in my opinion, and I have had Daily's from the early 90's.
The oxtails were the snallest I had ever seen, seriously super small with not much meat.
To top it off I initially paid with credit card and when I went back to the counter to grab 3 snapples I was told the minimum credit card purchase is $10, so no snapple, but $10 minimum credit card purchase.
I have read the other reviews and am confused, but hey this is just my opinion.
Good luck."}
{"text":"Jerk chicken is legit with just enough spice. Unexpectedly went after work around 6:30 (they close at 8) when I went in hey were sold out almost everything but jerk chicken, Curry chicken, white rice, and fish/shrimp. 
 You would think I would be upset with limited options but to me that was a good sign and I wanted jerk chicken anyway. I was very pleased....will be back for a beef patty and dumpling Saturday"}
{"text":"Wednesdays are a busy day!! LoL
They are out of food.....cant be mad about that though, the food here is really good!!
The Oxtails and Curry Goat will make you hurt yourself....
Weekly specials are delicious!!"}
{"text":"If you didn't know already, Taste of Jamaica is in a new location. They recently moved about a mile east to Lyndhurst, in a larger space next door to Crooked River BBQ. As a recent transplant to Ohio, this was my first visit -- so I'm not sure what their old space was like, but the new location is modern and spacious with video screen menus and ample seating. 

Happy to say that Taste of Jamaica surpasses my favorite Jamaican restaurants from the Washington D.C. area, which I've been missing as of late. I ordered the smaller portion of jerk chicken with rice and beans and cabbage ($8) and a beef patty ($2.50), which turned out to be an impressive amount of food for one person. I had to go full glutton. 

The beef patty was one of the best I've had in recent memory, with a hot, flaky crust and tender filling. I wouldn't be surprised if it was homemade. The jerk chicken, which was served in large chunks of bone-in dark and white meat with a light sauce, was phenomenally spiced and had me sweating after a few bites. The chicken had some charring -- possibly grilled or baked, which I prefer to stewed jerk chicken. The rice and beans were flavorful on their own, and the cabbage was tender but not overly cooked. I can't wait to go back to try the ox tails and stew peas. They also have daily specials, including jerk fried chicken twice a week, which sounds amazing. Service is super friendly and nice to boot. 

As a soon-to-be resident of Cleveland Heights, I'm glad to know this place is not too far away!"}
{"text":"I have to give it a five star.. We went there around 730 and most of the stuff on their menu was already sold out. So we ordered jerk chicken and beef pattie. As some of the reviewers said, the jerk chicken was pretty spicy but it came with a huge portion. I definitely cannot finish a large by myself. The flavor was very delicious. They even cooked their cabbage perfectly. Very impressed. The beef pattie was alright, smells a little weird, was not too impressed by that. My only complaint is their food supply. I understand that its a local store and they want to keep their ingredients fresh, so they tend to run out of food REALLY early. like 730 is not even that late for dinner and we've really only got 3 options for entree. So I guess you just have to go super early then."}
{"text":"I am from the East Coast and have Caribbean family so I know good Caribbean food and this is it!  First, although they are on a major thorofare, there is parking in the back-a plus!

I stopped by about 1:30 and decided to get a large curry chicken and a beef patty.  There is not much seating to eat in, so you may want it to go.  The kitchen is open and can be seen and is very clean, good sign!

I ordered a large curry chicken and a beef patty.  Cost - $12.50. The beef patty looked a little smaller than I am used to but was really packed with meat. Not as spicy as I like, but very good.  This was authentic.

When I got to my destination I opened this huge dish of curry chicken, rice and beans and sauteed cabbage.  The only thing I can say EXCELLENT.  Just like I had in mobay (Montego Bay Jamaica)!

The only reason I took off one star is that they only accept cash.  In this day and age, that is a real deterrent.  But we'll worth stopping by a cash machine and getting cash for authentic Caribbean food!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. I love the food from here and I tried lots like the curry goat, curry chicken, stewed chicken, oxtail and both chicken and beef patties.  Love it all.

However, this time I wanted something different and wanted to try the fish and I decided on stewed fish. When I asked for that, the woman probably hearing my American accent said, \"The fish comes with the head and tail.\"  I responded with \"As it should.\"  I have lived among Caribbean cultures for a long time, not to mention my wife is Caribbean, so that is how fish is always served.

When I put my fork in the flesh of the fish and tasted it, my eyes rolled back and all I could think of is that this is the best fish I have ever had in my life.  It took me back to the island.  It was so good. The vegetables called ground provisions, in the gravy was to die for.  This was the best plate of food I ever had!  This was the best dish I tasted from TOJ!  Authentic, delicious and a must try!!!!!"}
{"text":"I just dropped by today for the first time and wow was the food delicious! The beans and rice are the best I have ever had, the service was excellent, and the jerk chicken had some heat, and a ton of flavor. The prices are also amazing for how much food they give you. I cannot wait to go back."}
{"text":"Taste of Jamaica is located in an inconspicuous strip mall hidden away from Mayfield Road.

The restaurant is fairly small with roughly 15 tables to eat at, however I did take out like most people in line.

The menu is fairly normal for Jamaican food with patties, curries, peas/beans and rice, jerk chicken and fish.  For my first visit I choose to stick with the basics - jerk chicken, beef patty, curry patty, rice and boiled dumpling.  One thing I was disappointed with was that they did not have any festival to eat with the jerk chicken. I was a big fan of festival while visiting Jamaica because it would help dull the heat in your mouth afterwards.   While the jerk chicken was tender with excellent spices, it wasn't spicy?!? It wasn't even close to the spice level I got the last time I visited Scotchies in Jamaica. Maybe the spice level is \"americanized\" which would be very disappointing.  The beef and curry chicken patties were pretty good. The flavors melded well and were spiced just right. However the filling to crust mixture was a little off, too much filling caused the crust to separate leaving a huge gap. Also the boiled dumpling wasn't anything to write home about. 

Not a bad joint if your looking for Jamaican food in Cleveland. However it doesn't compare to the food you actually get on the island. Bummer. May try here again and order the saltfish and ackee for breakfast."}
{"text":"Jamaican. Naw. No rice and peas. Not able to get the full taste of the spice besides hot pepper sauce that was on the table."}
{"text":"The place is nice for the most part, I usually go for the curry chicken. I have learned that you have to go at the right time, which Is usually around lunch time around 12-4. you'll know it's pretty fresh and you'll get plenty of meat. The last time I went was like 2 hours before the close and when I got home I barely had meat!! But I learned my lesson. It's a pretty decent place."}
{"text":"Amazing jerked chicken, large portions, priced cheap. Can't beat it."}
{"text":"Been here several times and have never been disappointed with the food. Had jerk chicken both times and tried the curry chicken the 2nd time. Great both times. Only complaint I had was how the chicken is cut with bones in it, but this is how traditional Jamaican is served so I can't be too mad."}
{"text":"I used to be a patron of Rachels which was the restaurant before this place. (Same family owned Rachels.)

Anyhow I love this place, its clean, good food, good service. You just have to read the dry erase board on the wall to see what they have for the day. They run out of items quick so you just have to be prepared when you come in.

This is an authentic Jamaican food establishment and the food tastes GREAT!!!"}
