{"text":"Had some drinks with friends on the patio on a sunny day, cotton candy old fashioned was a really delicious surprise on the cocktail list. 
Service was efficient but could have been more personal. 
My friend got the kale salad which was on the smaller end portion wise for the price, but was yummy nonetheless."}
{"text":"There are good or bad of this restaurant.

First the good things.   The food is good.   The steak is the best one I have recently.   Salad and dessert is good.  

Now the bad things.   Reservation is hard to make.  During the day you can only talk to a machine.   Leave message but no one calls back.   I thought it is a high class restaurant based on the $$$$ rating in Yelp.   Then I found out that it is a small restaurant at a corner of a big hall.   I was disappointed about the parking downstairs.   I thought it is $10 flat rate but it is $20, probably due to event.   The scallop appetizer is too raw to eat.   Went with a Groupon and got charged a fixed amount of tips automatically."}
{"text":"On July 9th our party of four ate at the Watermark restaurant in the Radisson at the waterfront.  We used a Groupon which was to us a good value.  The restaurant has tweaked the groupon limiting appetizers and dessert selection.  We are not big eaters but portions for the soup of the day was less than half a cup, Salads were a tiny bit more generous.  The main course of which two of us had the filet mignon, one had the ribs and one had duck were wonderfully prepared.  The only thing we have to complain about was the service.  Scott who is a steadfast fixture of the restaurant had to cover for the other two servers who just couldn't get things right with the timing and the follow up. Thank goodness for Scott, make sure you get his section and you will have a flawless experience.  The setting for the restaurant is very very poor.  They use the same space where the breakfast buffet is and make no effort to conceal it.  The hotel should locate it where the water view of the harbor is.  Having people walk by your table in bathing suits does nothing for the ambience.  If the Watermark wants to create the illusion of exclusivity by saying your groupon is a $300 value they need to step up their game.  Worth the meal with a groupon? Absolutely. Worth $300 without the groupon?  No."}
{"text":"One of our regular haunts

We discovered this wonderful spot on Groupon a few months ago, and have been coming here regularly (still on Groupon) ever since.

The service is impeccable, the food is excellent (if you go for upscale cuisine), and the desserts are sublime!

The Groupon deal is great if you can find it, but I'd recommend this restaurant in general for an intimate, delicious and excellent dining experience."}
{"text":"Amazing place!
Very small, cozy and yet modern looking restaurant.  Food was delicious, service was great!  We were greeted by the name and it felt like we were friends already! Manager (who also happened to run the restaurant that evening) was very friendly, knowledgeable and pleasant.  We really enjoyed our meal."}
{"text":"Came here with my boyfriend before the leafs game and let me tell you what a great experience the executive chef came to take out orders off menu he told us we could have whatever we wanted, of course it was delicious we both got a spicy pasta but thats not the best part. After dinner we were going to have cheesecake but the chef told me the carrot cake was the BEST and it did not disappoint It was by far the best carrot cake ive ever had 10/10 everyone needs to try it"}
{"text":"The service was excellent. Scott was amazing. The quality of food was great as well. The filet Mignon is a must try!"}
{"text":"Amazing food very good place and most important waiters is amazing 
I recommend this place to everyone 
Enjoy night"}
{"text":"Went as a group of six to Watermark Restaurant and Lounge for dinner and we had a great time! Upon our arrival, we were received right away and although our table was not ready at the time, were seated very quickly. Our waiter was very friendly and funny and explained the menu very clearly. The food was succulent and the portions were appropriate. The chef came out and chatted with the tables, it was quite a treat! Overall, we all had a great experience and I would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Slow service and terrible food. I mean like a $20 overcooked dry fossilised burger bad. So nice to be by the lake but everything else about this place is a huge disappointment."}
{"text":"Not going to lie, came here because I got a Groupon.  They had a private event that day at Splash so only a small section was for Watermark around 6-7 tables cramped into the corner. I am not sure if the set up is usually like this. Seems like everyone that went had the Groupon as well as they had the 4 course meal.  The salad looked like it came from a package you can get from Costco.  We got the tiger prawn shrimp risotto for our app.  The main course was alot better.  I really liked my filet mignon done medium rare.  The meat was so juicy and tender I would go back just for that.  My wife got the lamb which was a little too rubbery for her liking.  The presentation was fab for the main, I loved the dish they served the food on as it looked like a platter.  The dessert was pretty weak as they gave you a variety of tiny dessert like some tarts, 1 strawberry and 1 raspberry for 2 people.  Overall not too bad."}
{"text":"Brought my mom, dad and aunt here, and they're notoriously picky eaters, but they loved the food. The filet mignon was the clear winner! Cooked perfectly and completed with mashed potatoes and a bunch of delicious veg.  Very friendly service, with the Chef coming out to chat and take a picture with us too."}
{"text":"Watermark Restaurant & Lounge
I went here for a four-course meal and used a Groupon.  

The lighting is quite bright in this venue.  I found the atmosphere to be pleasant.  The food was really good, I especially remember the soup and fillet mignon to be good.  The filet mignon was cooked perfectly, very surprising."}
{"text":"Dined tonight with a friend of mine. And I will start off by saying that this is definitely a five star restaurant, there's a reason why I only gave it four. I will get to that in a bit. 
I'll be honest and say this is the second time I came here, and the first time I had exemplary service and even more wonderful food, our server was a kind, tall man with glasses and really ensured we had an amazing time. 
This time, however....
We had a reservation for 7:00 and arrived exactly at 7:13. Without even seating us he just looks at us and says \"you are SO late\". Please note, that the restaur was only half filled at this point. That man was to be our server for most of the night. He is an older gentleman with grey hair. 
Our first courses were some amazing salads, and the ambience of this place really made a person feel special. The chef came out and actually asked us politely what we ordered. Barely had a conversation with this kind man when the Grey haired man immediately snapped forward and basically told him to get back to the kitchen to make the mains. And it wasn't as if the restaurant was full.
Skip to the second course. The calamari. It was wonderful, fresh and flavourful with just the right texture. I wanted to take a picture of it to put on this review. So I did. Little did I know that the Grey haired man was mocking me about it behind my back. My friend was like \"we can hear you\" and instantly he rushed forward saying \"hahaha, we have a fine print policy that we don't like pictures instagrammers, etc.\" Nice try pal -_- 
I mean, it wasn't like I was spending 10 minutes taking a picture. And even if I was, I came here to enjoy food and share my experience. NOT to be judged about it. 

As a result, I didn't take any more pictures. Not of the wonderful paella that had succulent scallops the size of a small cookie, not of the perfectly tender filet mignon, and not of the gorgeous cheesecakes with fresh strawberries we had for dessert. So, when I say they were absolutely magnificent, I guess you will just have to take my word for it. 

To top it all off, a different party arrived late for their 7:30 reservation. And the Grey haired man told them, \"oh I guess that's just the theme of the night, to be late\". He said that right in front of us.  Classy... 

Although this man was terribly rude, I do have to say that what made up for it was not only the food, but the intermittent times we were served by the young man with glasses. He was so courteous and always had a smile on his face. When I came here for the first time, my experience was so much better for not having the Grey haired man present. 

Long story short, the food is great, but if you have the Grey haired man as your server be prepared to be judged behind your back and told off in front of other strangers."}
{"text":"While the ambience of the restaurant seemed quite ordinary at first, the food more than made up for that. At first sight I was quite surprised at the small dining area, without any windows or any outside view. Seemed like a make shift dining area. The bar seating on the other hand is along the glass wall, overlooking the pool. Being at the fag end of winters, may be the restaurant was still hibernating, and a visit during the summer would probably allow me to view this place in all its glory.

The food on the other hand was great. The New England chowders were excellent, seafood seemed fresh, flavourful, and clean. For our app, we ordered portabello mushrooms with goat cheese. This was also a great combination of flavours bound together by the sweetness of a balsamic dressing and the spike of arugula. For our mains, I was torn between a Fillet Mignon or the braised Short Ribs. The server strongly suggested the short rib, and I went with it. I soon realized that Short Rib was the Hot Favourite of the service team that evening, as every table was recommended it and almost every table seemed to be ordering it. But the recommendation was spot on!! The short rib was beautifully braised to a fall off the bone level, with subtle flavours and accompanied with creamy polenta and veggies. A special shout out to the humble creamy polenta, I have been missing this guy since everyone favours mashes and fries these days with their meats. Also, special thanks for not making the polenta as a cake and keeping it creamy. Wife ordered a paella, that was probably a bit out of the kitchen's comfort zone, as the paella was dry, and not very flavourful. It was a forgattable dish. 

The desserts we ordered were tiramisu and a caramel chocolate decadence. To be honest, ending the meal at the mains and getting a coffee would probably have been a better choice. The decadence was alright. It was presented well, looked great, tasted alright. The tiramisu was an absolute disaster. It was just not a tiramisu at all. If my suggestions have any value whatsoever, I would give two: 1) Dont put that cream on the base of every dessert plate - it changes the taste of every dessert from what it was intended to be and just coats it with the same darn cream everytime you take a spoonful. 2) I know its dessert, and dessert has sugar, but we're probably going overboard with the amount of sugar in the desserts.

Overall, a great experience, Despite of the desserts playing spoil sport, would definitely visit again. Food is prepared with a lot of care, and a lot of planning....and it shows in the final plate you get."}
{"text":"I went to Watermark, on a sunday evening, and i have to say it is one of the most disappointing restaurants i've ever been to. This is especially true considering all the good reviews i've seen for this restaurant. it makes me doubt the people who review it. this is how bad this restaurant is. 

The first impression when walking in, is that the restaurant is a confused mess, there is no hostess and no staff to welcome. basically we stood there confused as to what is going on, to find out that they are terribly understaffed and have 1 working waiter, with another who doesn't seem to know what he is doing. We sat down and beginning looking through the menu, so a good 10-15 minutes passed before a server actually came to ask for our order.  We ordered the fried calamari.  as the appetizer, and cesar salad. For the main ordered a Filet Maginot steak at medium rare. 

so for the food the calamari was overcooked and burnt for the most parts. the Cesar salad was actually pretty decent. however the steak was by far the worst. the meat quality was just terrible in general. it was pretty rough, even at medium rare. and you can tell they gave you bad steak. and this is at the price of $35 for a steak. other place such as KEG or medium priced steak houses would be much better. 

the desert was a cold apply pie which was not good at all. 

Overall this restaurant the biggest problem is the food. it does not justify the cost, and is overall overpriced. poorly cooked, and waste of time. i would say anyone would be wise to avoid this restaurant. Their groupon deal is also a scam for the most parts. as they will charge you tips based on the original menu price, and make it a 25% mandatory tip.  which makes all your discounts pointles cause it will cost nearly the same as the original price after all the add on money, as well the tax is also taxed on original menu item price"}
{"text":"Came here with my boyfriend for the first time last night and it was great! The service was pleasant, our waiter was a very kind man, and the quality of food (salad, appetizer flat bread, main course: filet mignon, as dessert : cheesecake and ginger caramel cake) was spectacular. The ambiance was pretty, located inside the Radisson hotel, with little tree lights in view. We definitely had a really tasty, fun, and relaxing experience dining here!"}
{"text":"Great location. A little disappointed by the food tho. The restaurant was empty-ish. There should be some kind of sign outside the hotel...:/ I expected more for the filet mignon. Medium is almost medium well here"}
{"text":"Located in the Radisson hotel is a hidden gem. A great restaurant with one of Toronto's best chefs! Located right by the water with an amazing pool patio during summer months. The food was amazing and full of flavour.  The chef even came out to greet us. I'll definitely be coming here more often!"}

What an utter disappointment. I have been to college lounges that were better run by students with no experience in the field.

No Hostess/Host to greet you and help you to find your seat, I literally had planned to seat myself...
Chaos upon first entering...
When we walked entirely into the restaurant looking about one male server walked past us and disappeared into an opening in the wall...I decided to follow him since he was far too busy in the 10 person restaurant to stop... a female server emerged and offered for us to sit at the bar, which I refuse. If I had wanted to perch on a chair uncomfortably I'd have gone to a bar with an actual view instead if one facing a closed pool. There was also an empty table for two in the middle of the room which was clearly visible. The female waitress looked confused at my refusal and looked towards a male server no more than 10 feet from us who stated in a loud voice for the entire room you hear \"Just give them that one, I just don't want to deal with it right now\" he felt because the wall blocked him from our view...it also made us unable to hear him? What a complete and utter disgrace for a hotel restaurant, much less someone working in the service industry. 
They were of course 'out of' the more expensive seafood offerings which we dismissed as expected considering the manners of their employes and the dismal vibe that encased the entire scene of diners. 
As dinner began we ordered a bottle of wine and had two glasses of red brought to us as the Groupon came with it... however it was canceled before our main course as the significant failures horrified me enough to make reservations mid meal for another restaurant close to the area.
I ordered the salad and my bf ordered the soup. Mine was a salad out of a bag with goat cheese on top and all I tasted of the soup was tomato (why call it carrot soup?). For our appetizer we were given 1 springroll stuffed with mushrooms and goat cheese TO SHARE.
At this point I placed an online reservation to another restaurant, had we not had a Groupon I would have just left. The mains were brought out and looked nice. My medium rare filet minon was perfectly blue rare, and the duck my bf ordered was absolutely butchered, it was dry and disgusting... it truly broke my heart to see duck thus abused and poorly cooked as it is one of my favourite meats. For my blue rare meat I cut around it and gave my bf the center as he was thrilled and loves blue rare (I was too afraid to send it back as I was certain the 'bitch' they had commented on loudly  was a patron and they were not above spitting in our food) . The dessert platter was the only saving grace, it was visually appealing and absolutely delicious.
Our female server  (whose name I have forgotten) was nice enough, doing her best amidst the failure and was well deserving of her tip.
This was a very disappointing experience, as the hotels I have been to generally have amazing service and food. 
I do not personally wish to return as the very class less behavior of the staff was incredibly unnerving and it's not an experience I wish to endure even for free...
But I feel we may return (as my bf wishes to give them another chance) a second time to judge if this was a fluke or indicative of this restaurants quality. Will they be able to increase their 1 star rating? We shall see...

{"text":"Good location. Has a really great patio. Food is good too. Unfortunately despite its nice look and great location the service is sub par. It seem like everytime we go, the hostesses are confused. Today we stood in line for 45 minutes to get a table, even though there were many vacant tables. There was no hostess at the desk for the majority of the time, and when we asked how long the wait would be, the response was \"it's a bit of a wait\". it's not the worst place... if all you want is a beer on a patio by the waterfront, this place is okay."}
{"text":"Not worth the groupon price and the fixed tip and HST. The food was medicore, service was unprofessional and the atmostphere was not great considering it is on the 5th floor of a hotel. Will not be returning or recommending it to friends and/or family. Save your money on a fanicer restaurant. Hope this helps!"}
{"text":"TLDR: Make room for the filet mignon! 

When my boyfriend was scheduled to have his wisdom teeth removed, we made sure to have a really nice \"last meal\" before the surgery. 

We decided upon the Watermark, located in the Radisson. 

The restaurant is very open and has cozy decor. It seemed oddly quiet for a Friday night, but it made for easy conversation and great service. 

We both started with the caesar salad which was saucy and full of garlic, everything you're looking for in a caesar salad! We also shared the goat cheese mushroom appetizer with fig jam. This was an interesting menu item with crumbles of cheese on top of a large mushroom cap, spread with fig jam. Normally, that would be right up my alley, but the proportions seemed a bit off. Too much fig, perhaps, as it was overly sweet and we both could only eat one.

The filet mignon was the real winner! We've struggled with ordering steaks out in Ontario as it has been hard to compare to the steaks in Alberta, but I was so glad to have made the choice to go with this! The filet mignon was cooked to perfection, with sauce lining the plate, buttery mashed potatoes, and delicious roasted veggies. The portion was large but we couldn't stop eating. It was too good!

After dinner we enjoyed some chamomile tea with eggnog cheesecake and pumpkin cheesecake. It was a lovely way to end our evening. 

I'm excited to visit this spot in the summer, to enjoy the views!

{"text":"We went for lunch on a Saturday afternoon after a trip to the Toronto Islands. It was not busy at all, and the service was not all that attentive, which is why I am giving 3 stars. The server seemed stressed, which is understandable, but it was not that busy. The food was pricey, which is expected in that area. I was also disappointed in the drink menu, and did not end up ordering anything from it."}
