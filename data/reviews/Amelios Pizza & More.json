{"text":"I wanted to give them a lower rating,  but dang it, the pizza was so freaking good!  It took an hour and forty-five minutes to get my pizza to me.  They said it was because of construction... But, the pizza got to me piping hot, with a complimentary 2-liter of Diet Code and a very apologetic driver.  And, yes, the pizza was so good it was worth the wait.."}
{"text":"Horrible. I ordered a chicken parmesan sandwich and took them and hour to just bring that plus I couldn't even finish it. If you wanna try go for it but do not recommend them at all."}
{"text":"Seriously the biggest waste of time and appetite.... Got the wings today(spicy BBQ) and they were extremely overcooked. Couldn't even finish them. Ordered 12 ate 3. Ridiculous... like for real I was so hungry, never again."}
{"text":"Their food is alright. But their service is terrible and rude. I'm understanding with deliveries, but all three times it was a two hour wait, the third time I could tell the driver was either drunk or on some sort of drug. Bad bad bad. Won't spend another dime there."}
{"text":"In my opinion there wings are the best in Arizona and the Mexican pizza is a winner. They have everything you can possibly want on their menu. Their service is fast and friendly. I would highly recommend"}
{"text":"Very disappointing, we have been going here for over a year and we ordered two sandwiches to go, we were told it would only be ten minutes. 20 minutes later we got only half our order and didn't have time to wait for the other sandwich, when we got home we found the sandwich to be soggy and everything was just thrown together. a little  disappointed we called the manger and to our surprise it was the same guy who took the order. Not far into the call it was very clear he did not care about the quality of his food, his business or the customers he serves. Sadly we will not be supporting this local business anymore. Very sad."}
{"text":"I eat here a couple times a week, as I work right around the corner from them. I haven't ever had bad service. And for a \"fast food\" type of place it's pretty good, with large portions. I'll continue to support the small guys!"}
{"text":"Great food! I had never tried them before and thought I would venture out and try something new. Pleasantly surprised. Will definitely try them again."}
{"text":"We have been receiving their menu for awhile now and decided to try them out.  Got 2 kids meals that had more than enough for my kids.  Both enjoyed their food.  I got the tacos and they were so tastey.  My wife got a burrito and had to put it down for later.  We also got the carne asada cheese fries which were AMAZING!!!  It by itself would be a great meal.  Have no complaints about this place at all. Will be ordering again soon."}
{"text":"Not my favorite.  The pizza was OK but the carne asada fry's broke my heart.  Probably will not get again.."}
{"text":"My daughter was insistant on trying them because we received a flyer on our door. I was reluctant but the pizza was really good. A few nights later I called them when I had friends over, delivery was fast and the pizza was again really good even though it was a late Saturday night. The delivery guy was very nice both times he's delivered to our apartment. I've only been inside once to pick up and the face-to-face service was great as well. Although I must say the pizza and wings are really good the breadsticks were not good when we tried them, they were hard and burnt. However, we still really like the pizza and wings so we will continue to do business with them for the price, service and great pizza. BTW the sausage is the best!!!!"}
{"text":"Not the greatest food anyhow,  but I call after ordering chicken burrito plate because there's hair in my rice.   Like it's hard to pull it so it's in there,  in there.   I don't want new food,  just to let them know.... The guy who answers says that's impossible they wear hair nets,  so I offer to send him a picture or he can send someone back to look at it.   It's IN the. Food,  not on top or around,  IN it.   He says hold on and somebody else gets on the phone.  I proceed to tell him the same story... I say you don't have to bring me more food... He says Oh I know.   Doesn't offer anything... Says thanks for letting him know.  Things happen but for real,  no I'm sorry... No nothing?? Don't bother!!"}
{"text":"This may be the last time I order from this place for delivery... I have no idea how they can not grasp the words \"NO MAYO\".. They don't listen when you tell them you don't want something and make it that way anyways and when you try to call back and talk to them it's just a hassle... I enjoyed this place once upon a time but it's going down hill.."}
{"text":"Great variety, mediocre food. I ordered the pizza and wings first. The pizza wasn't bad, but in comparison, Little Cesars is much better (and even they are okay at best). The wings were small and overcooked and to top it off, the wing sauce was very plain. My first experience wasn't horrible though, so i thought id give it another shot. I ordered the Carne Asada tacos today, and man, it was horrid. The meat was overcooked, dry and bland. The only way i could stomach the food was drenching it in sour cream and guacamole (which costs extra). The tacos came with a side of fries covered in nacho cheese sauce and bacon. Which wasn't bad, even though the fries had been sitting for a while. To sum it up, if you want pizza, go elsewhere. If you want Mexican food, go elsewhere. I don't think ill even give them the 3strikes you're out rule."}
{"text":"I wouldn't even give this place 1 star! We've ordered from here several times...food is decent but the person who attempted to take my last order was not only incompetent but incredibly rude!! I tried to complete my order as politely as possible but finally I just had to hang up because I couldn't stand listening to him sigh and grunt with every word I spoke!! I ended up throwing this place's menu in the trash!!!"}
{"text":"I just moved to the northside, and was looking for pizza/wing place. I drove by here a few times so i tried it out.

It tastes pretty close to little ceasars. It even smells like little ceasars.  Difference is, I know what I am walking into when i get a LC pizza, I only do it for the price $5 and having it \"now\".

However for $25 for a pizza and wings, I expect something better than Little Ceasars. The pizza was chewey and cardboardish, and tasted just like LC. The wings had a \"different\" flavor...wasn't great, wasn't horrible, but the sauce looked like old cooking grease.

I walked in 20 minutes after my phone order (they said 20). Pizza wasn't ready so I took a seat. Some guy put a pizza out, but the register goon took 3 more orders before looking at it, and nobody else working bothered to ask the room who is waiting. So in all, i waited ten minutes after showing up, 7 of which my pizza was sitting right there. It was cold when I got home. The kids dug in, but I had a turkey sandwich.

Freaking nasty, overpriced, and incompetent staff. I will never go back."}
{"text":"I've only ever eaten their pizza and specialty fries, although I have a few other things on the menu I'd like to try.  The food is always good and they're always nice when I'm at the location.  Their delivery can take a little while sometimes but most people take forever getting to my place so I'm kind of used to that.  All in good, good food for a good price.  I would recommend trying it."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a couple of slices at lunch and really enjoyed the experience. Pizza was hot and fresh, toppings were perfect.

Service was provided by a pleasant young man and the restaurant was clean and well appointed.

The menu covers a range of items from multiple ethnicities and if they are as good as the pie then I will be thrilled to try them all!"}
{"text":"Found this little gem and was surprised how good it was and affordable. Super nice staff and never disappointed."}
{"text":"READ THE WHOLE POST PLEASE:

Have been a loyal customer for years, tonight we ordered a pizza and a 3 shrimp taco special that is served with fries.  The pizza is always good, the fries are fries withsome type of canned cheese sauce andbacon bits on them, the shrimp tacos are on 3 small double corn tortillas, they have melted cheese,tomato,some spice that is tasty, andlettuce.  Now here is the deal,  tonight I decided to pickup our order.  Got home, opened the taco box, and the very first thing I see is the discusting huge chunk of brownish wilted lettuce, after thouroughly dismanteling all three tcaos, I was left with a mound of brownish wilted lettuce.  Now yes I know that lettuce wilts when it touches hot items, ie, grilled shrimp, but this was just way past that ,  It was bad, old, gross.  So I call into just give the store a heads up, maybe they should check so no other customers gets sub par food.  The man that I spoke to was pleasant, offered to credit us an order of tacos for next time, he even said I know you order from us alot.  So thats nice thank you.  

A few minutes later my phone rings. I answer,  It is Will form amelios, now I dont know who Will is but he said that they checked out they lettuce and it comes in bagged and prechopped and that it is all great and has no problems, so they will not be able to credit me for another order unless I drive it back up to him,  that is not a possiblity as I care for my 90 year old grandmother and I will not be going back up there just to prove my point.  But anyhow, I was astonished, Will said the manger looked into it and asked him to call me.  They called me just to inform me that Im wrong about this lettuce,  seriously!  Not sure what has changed there,but its not a good change,a dn any manager of any business should have the common sense to know better than to be dissrepectful of good customers.  

I took pics of the perfect lettuce cant post them 
I realize that bad lettuce is a small thing to be upset about, and I wsant, I am bothered by the managment having someone call back to tell me that Im wrong.  So rediculous. 


No more Amelios for us!!!!!"}
{"text":"This is my new favorite place that is super close to my house. They literally have everything. Always great food at awesome prices. The service is excellent. The delivery guys are super awesome always friendly. I love this place. I've been going more often and I'll continue on going as long as they keep it up. Try the buffalo chicken salad it's so good! Also the sampler platter! Can't pass up some breaded mushrooms!"}
{"text":"This place has fantastic wings!!! I just started going here not to long ago. Kept driving by and would see the sign. Finally I stopped in and ordered some wings and a pizza. Wings were damn good but were hot as hell. I like lots of flavor with a bit of kick. These had good flavor but burned my damn face off. The pizza on the other hand was really not that great. I have been for wings several times since. Switched to medium and there fantastic every time. I finally gave in and ordered the $5 pizza special and this time it was really good. I hope it stays this good because the price is sure right. If you haven't yet give this place a try, I think you will like it. Good food for cheap!"}
{"text":"5 ++ stars for their desserts- have had every one except churro and most recently the chocolate cake, which I think previously was a big hunk of traditional chocolate cake w chocolate icing... now it's more cheesecake-like, firm, chocolate syrup - but the best part is: I think it's dark chocolate(prob was, I couldn't catch sleep later!). Now that I'm a grown-up, dk chocolate is my very very fave so thanks guys! The slices of the desserts are smaller than I'd like, for 5 bucks-but if you're jonesing-you can't go wrong with any of them. Except the churro. Never been a fan. Have not had much of their regular food- Friday night got a cheesesteak with a bunch of special requests and a 1/2 order of fries(plain). French fries typically don't travel well for delivery & I expected that but I love the squishy ones anyway, a bit too much salt, so that was fine-as for my cheesesteak...I'm pretty sure it didn't have any cheese, I requested american-& opted for double meat. I don't think it was worth the extra $(maybe I only got single?)Plus, because the meat was plopped in the center of the cut roll, I had to rebuild the sandwich entirely. Not much flavor. But I was born & raised in Philly, so I'm pretty jaded.  I'd love it more if instead of cutting the sandwich in 1/2 & putting in styro container, they grabbed a piece of wax paper/tin foil & wrapped up tight so the meat juice gets into the roll. The roll was fresh and crispy on the corners. Delivery guy called 5 mins out to double check my addy & let me know he was close. Ordered delivery about 5-6 times over the past year or so and NEVER had any issues.  
I would like to request contact from the owner regarding another review I read tonight that Yelp REALLY needs to investigate. I'll be happy to help.
Thanks."}
{"text":"Their Pizza is very good and I've also had burgers, hot dogs and fish tacos and all were excellent. I like the delivery guys too, they often call when a few minutes out and always have cheese and crushed pepper packets. A great neighborhood joint."}
{"text":"Love this place ! Our #1 delivery restaurant. Food and service is always top notch !!"}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place, have ordered here multiple times everything I have ordered has been great. Now chicken pizza is to die for. Good food, reasonable prices and fast delivery"}
{"text":"Nooooo I'm so bummed the quality is worse. I ordered a chicken avocado salad, a calzone and pizza. The avocado was old, like more than half black. Why was it added like that? Calzone was odd, maybe old? It could be an off day but seriously WHY? I haven't been in a long time and now I understand other reviews. Bummer."}
{"text":"Ordered food from this place to pick up on Grubhub at 1:00pm AZ time today, same day. Received confirmation for a pick up at 1:20pm. Seems reasonable. However, we received another txt msg from Grubhub stating the restaurant changed the pick up time to 2:10pm. I called immediately and informed I needed to cancel the order. They inform me that the order is ready for pick up. I ask why did you change the pick up time? They say you cannot cancel, it is ready for pickup. I asked why did you change the the pick up time? Again, you cannot cancel order. Ohhhhhh OK. I go in at 145 pm, I inform them to not change the pick up time when it would be ready at the frist given time. otherwise I wouldn't have tried to cancel. My response \"whatever, you can call Grubhub\". Umm no, you, the restaurant, changed the time. My response, you'll see my review on Grubhub and on yelp. 
The food is shit. I could've cooked it better myself, but it's Phx, AZ and too fucking hot so why not make someone else do it. Creating jobs right? Well if you can't take an order properly and make sure all the food is there, or perhaps cook it well enough to eat, maybe your restaurant wouldn't be empty. If you're into that, then this place is for you, if not cook your own food. Wow, I'm finishing up this review and I still have 4 min before my food was \" supposed\"to be ready. Which means, if I had gone by their \"estimated time for pick up\" my food would be worse than what it was at \"fresh\" ."}
{"text":"Ordered a few hot dogs with fries and a drink. The Maxwell street dog was good, I liked the little peppers lining the sides. 

For when I'm too lazy to make something myself, Amelios seems to deliver a little of everything and I'll definitely order again to try other stuff!"}
{"text":"Food was just ok and I tried the suggestions...don't suggest something and claim it's the best when it's ok...the prices are a little steep too...how do you sell a drink that say 99 cents for $1.75?"}
{"text":"This place knows me by now especially every Sunday for Football time! I love there wings I request Drums Very Well Done and Crispy and I always get them right!! The sauce is really good and spicy I think they use a lot of pepper! And that's good!  Friendly staff"}
{"text":"Everything I go there I get a side of wings with whatever I'm having. They r the best wings I have ever had. I also love their portion size. What I thought was a going to be a side salad turned into a full meal. They r just fantastic!

Update: was a 5 star but now a 4 star. They increased their prices quite a bit."}
{"text":"Oh Amelio's, I remember you from years ago when we used to order pizza's from you almost every Tuesday night, to take advantage of your buy 1 get 1 free pizza special. I haven't had an Amelio's pie in years, so I decided to try them out again by ordering up a large extra cheese & some breadsticks.

The large cheese pizza tasted ok, but parts of the pizza had absolutely no crust on the end of the slices, it was like eating flatbread pizza with the crust chopped off. C'mon guys, no crust, rly?

The extra cheese also seemed to be concentrated on just 2 of the 8 slices of the pie, which was disappointing. 

The breadsticks were tasty, but the sauces were way too small to accomodate all the breadsticks. 

Amelio's, please make your pizzas better and quit skimping on the sauce sides."}
{"text":"I ordered almost every category from their menu for a group of friends and their kids. I thought it was odd 1st the variety and 2nd the menu size. My first thought is I have a toss up: is everything going to be freezer burned or out of date? Neither of these were the case. It was great! Everyone at the gathering had different tastes, it worked out perfect. Salads were fresh, wings were amazing, desert was delightful, teriyaki chicken bowls were stellar, kids were happy and so were all of us! Highly recommend. Delivery was polite and under the allotted time. Nothing was missed including dips, dressings etc."}
{"text":"The gentlemen there are VERY polite and the food is delicious. Brought a friend here today and she will be going back on her own. Love this place!!"}
{"text":"We have been ordering now about once a month adn enjoy it each time. The $5 special for pizza and $5 special for wings really hit the spot and not the bank account. I can only complain about the ranch... we dislike buttermilk ranch esp on pizza. LOL"}
{"text":"Okay, I'm giving them one star right now.... Because of the lack of customer service that they have as far as when it comes to the delivery drivers. Their timing is horrible, they're always forgetting items. But if you actually go inside and eat there the customer service is fantastic. And the food is beyond amazing. But if you're going to order food and have it delivered expect hassle. It's sad to say but it's true."}
{"text":"This place has some nasty food.  We got two burgers, one sub and one grilled chicken sandwich.  Both burgers were WAY over cooked.  The fries were old and greasy.  The bun was bigger than the chicken breast.  My son that loves bacon said that even the bacon tasted fake or plastic???  I would not recommend this place to anyone...... Ever!"}
{"text":"Who would have expected to find great carne asada in an Italian restaurant?

I've had the pizza and loved it but dang if these guys aren't doing it right with the Mexican menu!

Try this place out and be sure to get the carne asada burro!"}
{"text":"Ordered 2 Chicago dogs, way too much mustard,  yuck  worst I have ever had....never again waste of money"}
{"text":"Stopped by to pick up lunch for the staff today. Pricing was great for under $18 bucks for an XL pie. Veggies were good staff was friends. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"One star because food is ok. Customer service is horrible, will never order from the shit hole again. The person taking my order couldn't hear me was giving me nothing but attitude then hung up on me and then when I called back told me he didn't hang up on me and was still very rude and incompetent."}
{"text":"I just got the $5 cheese pizza. For a $5 pizza it was good. I typically don't like a lot of sauce on my pizza and they got that part perfect... Just the right amount of sauce. Mine was slightly over cooked but no big deal. Crust is really yummy"}
{"text":"I'm gonna be honest here and say this place really cuts corners I read reviews after ordering and started to really question my dignity anyway the order was party pizza pepperoni and olive and also order of special fries and  wings. The pizza had a sprinkle of olives and the fries are limper then a wet noodle with a spit in the face putting hidden valley ranch in a small container for dipping no exaggeration here the food quality here is lower then my self esteem at the age of newborn when I found out my mom is a ghoulish gargoyle and this place cuts corners on it's pizza and appetizers and ranch... Ranch for fucks sake not since the holocaust have I been this appalled by kung fu treachery."}
{"text":"Ordered here several times!  Great food and great service!  There prices are very good and the value is amazing!   I will always make this a staple while ordering takeout!"}
{"text":"Wow.....I have not ever had any of the experiences of the bad reviews. 
I frequent here enough where they know me by name. 
They've always been nice, professional asked me about my work, hows life etc. 
My foods always been on time, hot and tasted good. 
I don't think my order ever has been wrong but I order pretty basic. 
Bean & Cheese burritos, 5 dollar cheese pizza, Deep fried mushrooms & zucchini.
Anyway, I dig this place. Its great cheap pizza, no frills and the burritos are monster sized."}
{"text":"Ordered on their app almost 2 1/2 hours and my order never showed. For 3 items? Really. Amusing. Maybe going there in person would Be better, but don't use the app."}
{"text":"Had a really bad experience.  I ordered, and the food was actually good quality, but both the order taker and the delivery guy were rude.  Worst customer service I've had in a long long time, will not be coming back."}
{"text":"I got a menu on my doorknob and decided to order delivery because they just about had everything on the menu; from pizza, to mexican, to hot dogs.
I found their delivery charges to be a lot-$2 and then I also saw on the menu that they add $1 if you dine in. Who does that??? It seems tacky to nickle and dime your customers that way.
Our food was ok-my hot dog was great, though my husband said his meatball parm was just ok. Our french fries were dry and over fried.
No idea what the actual place looks like but with our meh delivery experience, it doesn't really make a difference to me.
I'll pass on this one."}
{"text":"I've most def got cabin fever. I've been stuck inside for days, fighting off this nasty cold. Sooo over eating soup! So, I decided to order in.  I was excited to see some of their offerings but was highly disappointed when it arrived. The Monte Cristo was no more than soggy French toast with ham and cheese, covered in strawberry syrup. No flavor. It wasn't fried. No crisp. No powdered sugar. The Philly Fries were ok but the fries weren't even cooked thoroughly. I also ordered the White Chocolate Raspberry cake and I haven't tasted it yet but it's def not cake, more like a cheesecake and it's only an inch wide. Def not worth the $25 I spent on this delivery order (plus tip). How disappointing :("}
{"text":"RANDOMLY stopped here for some quick food Togo... Pizza was great! The staff that night was friendly and helped us and accommodated to all of our small requests last night. 

Thank you! Loved your pizza!"}
{"text":"This place has great tacos.  Love the cheese fries that come with my food.  4 stars because they forgot a few things on my order... 
Also. .. when ever I order something and my bf orders his plain.  They make both orders plain.  That sucks because I like the extras. .....

but the food is so good I just keep ordering. Mmm mmmmmmm. Now I want tacos....

I truly love this place.  Sometimes they take an hour for delivery. Sometimes they forget things. But I will still love this place forever. 

Try the churro. . Amaz.... mmmm"}
{"text":"Tuesday - $10 pizza. 5-toppings, all of which were good. Fresh 'shrooms (not canned), jalapenos that were actually hot (yeah), tons of black olives, sausage and salami. The sauce was a bit sweet - but not cloying.

Went in and picked it up - quick and easy. No problems."}
{"text":"Fuuuuuuuuuuuuck Amelio's!!!! They can't get one fuckin' order right!! 2 chicken avocado salads , that's it!! That's all but noooooooooo. Every damn time I'm missing avocado.  Every time. It's been a continuous error over 5x already.  Like damn you add one fuckin job! One! Then when they mess up they do nothing to make the  CUSTOMER SATISFIED. NOTHING. Then the cashier as the nerve to hang up on me when I asked for a refund. All they want is your money... prices go every 3 months... bets believe I'll never give you another penny of mine.  If you dare order from her quadruple check your order."}
{"text":"We ordered food at 8:00pm online said 40 min finally 9:00pm we called 
Oh the order is about to leave 
That never happened 
Called the manger hung up on us 
This was our 12th order 
Never again 
Horrible CUST service 
And still no dinner"}
{"text":"Placed the order online which was the Shredded Beef Super Nachos and a 12 piece order of wings.  The total was pretty expensive not including the delivery charge.  The good thing that the order arrived super fast like in 20-25 minutes.  The wings were pretty good, standard size with Honey BBQ and the Super Nachos were LOADED.  I mean, if your expecting a good size portion of nachos for $10 then this is more than enough and satisfaction guaranteed.  I was totally satisfied when i was done, im definitely going to order in the future."}
{"text":"I wish they opened early so I could start my day with a breakfast burrito. What a hidden gem. Super nice Mom and Pop establishment. No room or ambiance for big groups or more than 4 4-people parties max but I'd love for them to be discovered. Great portions, super nice staff. All your comfort foods and very reasonable prices. Thank you so much!"}
{"text":"You would never know, nothing that special about the name or the exterior. But the menu is ridiculous! And so is the food! At first, I was like \"come on, no way. Let me get this straight. This place has pizza, Italian food, Mexican food and carne asada, burritos, Teriyaki..WHAT??\" But the food is really good! And with that diverse of a menu, we ordered three times in one week from work! You can place an order online and pick up. I ordered the carne asada tacos. The nacho cheese fries with bacon bits? Fuggeduhbowditt!! I had nachos with steak one day, my coworker had the Mexican Pizza. It was huge! Plenty for the next day. Great lunch place and dinner too. A couple dollars or so over on their prices but that's the only thing really. Try it out!"}
{"text":"My BF got food poisoning here on 12/6! He had the Carne Asada taco special. Beware, other reviews have complained of old looking food. So disappointed and upset as we just moved to the area and love to support local businesses: Thankfully I was out of town and don't eat meat so I didn't suffer the same fate! We will never be back!"}
