{"text":"The pizza crust is so flavourful and crispy (without being hard). They have quite a few specials, making it such a cheap eat!"}
{"text":"Great pizza, sooo crunchy. The also have good deals on pizza wings and fries. The owners are pretty cool too"}
{"text":"My new favourite! (OK, tied for favourite BUT) This is old school Toronto pizza with a crunchy crust and sweet sauce. You will definitely not see a snooty Napoli pizzaiolo bless the oven with his approval, but this is the kind of pizza I grew up with in the '80s (it's a bit like Pizza Delight or McDonald's pizza). Grab a slice a slice, pop an old Wrestlemania tape in the VCR and enjoy!"}
