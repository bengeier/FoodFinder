{"text":"I will start off with the fact that we were on a time limit, we had just under an hour to eat so we didn't have time to sit around and wait. The waitress was awkward and very uno servant and it took us 45 minutes to get out food. A large party got their food before we did which was frustrating. The portions were small, but was expected for the price. But the food did taste good at least, that's why I give it 2 stars."}
{"text":"My husband and I have quite a few tattoos, so we expect to be treated a little differently sometimes. But when we walked into this place, no one wanted to serve us, and when someone finally did, she acted very much like we were not welcome. After a bit, no one came to refill my coffee so my husband asked if I could get some more and the waitress scoffed at him like it would be an inconvenience for her to do so. That was the final straw. I left $20 on the table to pay for our order and we left. Ridiculous."}
{"text":"What a joyful place!  Bright, friendly staff, pleasant atmosphere, local art adorn the walls and good home cooking. Had breakfast there this morning, ordered pancakes and eggs,we didn't want the meat so they knocked $2 off!  Will go again and definitely recommend it.  It's so nice to have a cafe In our neighborhood that isn't a chain but the passion of an individual.  Susan"}
{"text":"My sister and her friend were in town from Denver and I wanted to try this place, after reading good reviews. We went in for lunch. My sister ordered some chicken tenders. I ordered a burger, and tho other woman ordered something that I don't remember. The chicken tenders were from frozen , I think, and my sister disliked them. Her salad was not fresh either. My burger was just okay. I was very disappointed to take my sister here. The server was nice, and he knew we were not very happy, and he discounted the meal. I will not be going there again. It was below average."}
{"text":"Horrible service....  Not a friendly place at all if you don't fit their theme... Would not recommend to people who live in the immediate area... Other places with better food and NO JUDGMENTAL attitudes...."}
{"text":"My family and I decided to try this new restaurant that opened up November 2015.  This is a very friendly restaurant where everyone is greeted when they walk in.  My husband tried the sausage biscuits and gravy which he stated were very good and fresh. I tried the build your own omelette which was so good my granddaughter wanted to try it.  Nope not sharing.  My granddaughter got a children's pancake that she loved.  Now my son who is a very good cook got eggs poached along with his chicken fried steak said they were cooked perfectly.  So the best part besides how great the food and staff are is their pricing.  Come on in and try them out"}
{"text":"Great restaurant.  My wife and I tried this place because it was in walking distance.  Everything we ordered was tasty and you can tell it's all homecooked and not just from frozen.  The restaurant was also very clean and the staff is friendly.  Overall just a pleasant dinning experience."}
{"text":"The good reviews were accurate.  My wife and I went in for lunch.  You can't get any better prices.  The food was fine, especially for the cost.  The service was great!  I can't say the food wowed me but it was a really good experience.  Try it out and see for yourself."}
{"text":"This place is quant and cozy. The service was fantastic, husband and wife team. Super friendly and food was good.  Biscuits and gravy where delish, and love they made me iced coffee. The price was really great. They have daily specials. I appreciate a mom and pop place, they work hard to build a customer base. This place is well on its way, only opened in Nov. 2015. So give them a try."}
{"text":"Loved this spot! We dropped in, looking for something new. Saw the ratings and had to stop in. They were so friendly and the complimentary muffins for being first-timers were so yummy! My son had biscuits and gravy and they were fresh and hot. My boyfriend had the same w a side of corned beef and hash. I had the Popeye omelette. Everything was really good. We'll definitely be back!!"}

{"text":"My friend Terri recomended this place for breakfast.  The coffee was great!  Biscuits and gravy Yum. But their country potatoes are the star of that restaurant! It a new mom and pop place so let's get out and support them!"}
{"text":"We went here because of the reviews, nothing special to rave about, the place is clean and the people were friendly.  Food was ok. Very reasonable prices."}
{"text":"Great local breakfast joint! Sunday morning and the other restaurants looked like an hour wait, so decided to try joyfull, glad we did! Country fried steak was GREAT amazing batter and done fresh there. Biscuits and gravy was top notch too. Gravy was nice and thick with a ton of sausage in it! Inexpensive great feeling and tasting local cafe! We will be back"}
{"text":"Love this place- it's a hidden gem! Staff is amazing food is great -and inexpensive! I'm picky and I love this place ...."}
{"text":"Went there this morning with my wife for some breakfast after seeing someone on the sidewalk with a sign.  We were sat down quickly and received our drinks.  We ordered pancakes and biscuits and gravy.  Before the food arrived, both my wife and I noted the music was a bit odd.  It was really odd sounding Christmas music with someone almost screaching.  The pancakes were normal regular pancakes.  Nothing special.  The biscuits and gravy was a different story.  The biscuit was plain.  The gravy was not good.  Although it was sausage gravy, it was sweet.  I've never had sweet gravy.  If it wasn't sweet, it probably would have been better.  The other thing - it appeared to be old.  The gravy was starting to separate.  Our server left halfway through our meal and another server took over.  Overall it was disappointing and we will not be back."}
{"text":"Had breakfast Monday morning very good food had ham omelet with country potatoes rye toast. Service excellent Will definitely be back"}
