{"text":"This place is probably pretty smart to open in Charlotte since Charlotte loves to support its corporate franchises. This is just a not as good knock-off of Biscuit Head in Asheville/Greenville- but owned by Cracker Barrel. Maybe I am biased, but I just would rather give my money to a family owned restaurant instead of Cracker Barrel. I think Cracker Barrel is doing just fine and doesn't need to make more money. I am sure the chefs are fine here, but I wish they had just made their own restaurant instead of doing it this route."}
{"text":"My husband and I finally were able to check out Holler and Dash this Sunday around 12ish. I definitely get the hype....the food is delish!  We walked in and it was slammed. There were no tables so we decided to put in an online order and go grocery shopping while it was being made.  I will say, the online order pickup process is super confusing and I really think there needs to be more clarification. We were not the only ones confused. There isnt any information inside about where pickups are actually pickup'ed. Since it was so busy, we stood around for a while trying to figure out what was going on. Finally, I just grabbed someone to ask. I think our order got a bit lost in the system but one of the waitresses figured it out and pushed the order through the line. This whole process was really my only negative of this place.  When we got home, the food was still hot and we dug in. We got the Kickback Chicken sandwich with corn and tots. The sandwich was big enough for me and my hubby to split and was sooooooo good. The goat cheese on it was so flavorful. The chicken was a nice size for the biscuit. The corn was really tasty and lots of flavors. I didn't really love the tots....seemed pretty average tots. I thought they were supposed to come with a sauce but they came with ketchup, so not as fun. The tots also were all stuck together and just crumbled. Probs won't order tots next time. I have my eyes on the grits anyways!   We absolutely will return!"}
{"text":"This is my go-to day off guilty pleasure. I've been three times and each time the service has been consistent and the food has been great. Chicken, Set, Go is always great. I have also tried the Pig in the Garden Sandwich which was tasty, but a little hard to navigate while eating. I look forward to eating my through this menu and discovering more delicious dishes!"}
{"text":"Biscuit so good it makes me wanna holler!   As soon as we walked in, a friendly employee handed us a menu to review before ordering. My friend and I both ordered the Kickback chicken biscuit with the charred corn salad as our side. Needless to say our taste buds were overjoyed with the balance of the goat cheese and pepper jelly. The chicken itself was also very well seasoned.   An important note is that the charred corn salad isn't mayo-based. It's actually greek yogurt instead which makes it a little healthier but still so flavorful!   The biscuit itself was moist and there was enough left after eating the chicken to enjoy with one of the spreads available. We tried the raspberry, blackberry, and the pepper jelly. The raspberry and blackberry are more like preserves than jam if that matters to you.   The caramel latte served as a nice finish to my breakfast. While the focus isn't on coffee the foam art was a very pleasant surprise. This may have been my first visit but it's certainly not my last."}
{"text":"God Bless this place.... Everything is good... Chicken biscuits and salads are awesome! Go on and give it a go, you wont regret it."}
{"text":"Great Sweet had sugar in it like a sodar the biscuiter was ok like mine kind of softer . The cheesy gritz was so good look like ricer it was goofed"}
{"text":"y'all. Y'ALL. I was introduced to this place in FL and was so stoked when it came to Charlotte. Massive biscuits. Delicious meats. The BEIGNETS.   My faves are the andouille hustle and the pork rambler. Go for the former if you're feeling gravy, the second if you want a sandwich. I usually add an egg. the biscuits are massive so you don't need a side but the tots dipped in the gravy or hollerback sauce are so good.   but circling back to the beignets. fluffy and flaky and they melt on your mouth. I'd do awful things for the chocolate coffee dipping sauce.   do it. just go."}
{"text":"I tried to order the Garden Goat but wanted to substitute the goat cheese for a different cheese because I don't like goat cheese. The cashier said I couldn't because the fried goat cheese medallion is considered the protein on that signature biscuit. She then suggested the Hollerback Club without bacon (I'm vegetarian) but I noticed that signature biscuit didn't include a cheese so I asked if I could substitute the bacon for a slice of cheddar cheese. The cashier once again said no. When I told her never mind I'll just go somewhere else to eat, she said she could make the substitution this one time for me but they don't typically do it...but I had already had enough, it's disappointing how un-accommodating and difficult they were to me for simple requests. A slice of cheese would cost them less than bacon. Sigh."}
{"text":"This place was cute and efficiently run! I got the avocado toast and a yogurt parfait, which are two of my favorite things on the planet for breakfast, and they did not disappoint. The avocado toast was especially beautiful with the watermelon radish on top. I also ordered an iced americano, which is my go-to for summer mornings, and it was great.  The place was nicely decorated and even though it was packed it didn't feel too crazy busy. This is kind of silly, but the bathrooms really impressed me too. They were clean, had funny signs, and the dyson sink was awesome- I've never seen one of those before!  I would definitely check it out again, and order these same items."}
{"text":"This place was alright. My husband got the pork and Blackberry biscuit breakfast. It was a delicious, southern classic of salt, cholesterol and oil. But let's be honest you dont come to a place like this for healthy. Unfortunately I was dumb enough to and ordered one of their bowls. My cashier had a very hard time with the fact that I didn't want dressing on it. I couldn't add avocado... why? The greens were shriveled and yellow. The pickled onion and sweet potato just tasted like cold salt, and the charred corn is actually a little corn medley drowning in mayo. I was unbelievably disappointed in mine, but my husband loved his."}
{"text":"When I heard about the concept of Holler & Dash I was extremely excited. Biscuits with chicken/pork/whatever are one of my favorite breakfast items and one of my favorite things period.  Parking is easy enough to come by since it's right next to a Harris Teeter. We went shortly after it opened so there was a pretty substantial line curling from the register up to and out the door. That's always a good sign and the line was moving pretty fast anyway!  There were too many things I wanted on the menu so it was a difficult decision. Luckily I had scouted the menu beforehand and decided to go with the Pork Rambler with tots. The pork ramber came with a fried pork tenderloin, blackberry butter, and onion straws.  Number one, the whole biscuit pork combination of flavor was delicious. Each component of the biscuit was tasty - INCLUDING the biscuit. I've had these types of sandwiches in the past where the meat and accoutrements are great, but the biscuit or bread is garbage. This was not the case. Biscuit was fantastic.  The tots were O.K. Needed a little bit of salt or a little kick of something. I was able to taste the grits and they were pretty good as well.   Don't sleep on: The pepper jelly. They serve it on the Kickback chicken sandwich but I bought a jar of it anyway because I knew it would be gold.  Because there are so many tempting things on the menu, I'll be back soon!"}
{"text":"Greeted at the door by a worker who offered a menu and was available to answer any questions. I went in thinking I would get the pimento cheese biscuit but the worker advised their most popular was the chicken with the pepper jelly, green onions and goat cheese. The chicken was the real star in that combo. Perfectly seasoned."}
{"text":"Great sausage gravy, fabulous biscuits.  I loved the andouille sausage biscuit with gravy."}
{"text":"I get the hype. They deserve it.   I stopped in on Friday morning and luckily there was no line! I was promptly greeted and given a run down of the menu. I wanted to try so many things...honestly everything sounded so delicious. But I decided that for my first visit I'd keep it simple.   I ordered a chicken biscuit - to go. No sides or toppings.   My goodness.   It was delicious. The chicken has a nice golden crust with a lot of flavor and seasoning. The biscuit was heavenly. Like I said before...I get the hype. They earned it! Everything about my order was perfect.     I'm already planning my next visit. I want to try pretty much everything on the menu (don't judge me...I'm a foodie) but especially the beignets. A biscuit and beignets? Yum. I'm here for it.   Congrats Holler & Dash! You can add me to your ever growing list of fans."}
{"text":"Well i have been here 3 times in total. Each time the cust service is worse and worse.  The employee that took my order was to busy listening to coworkers client ordering than to mine. Repeated myself several times. Also I have never been to a place where when you are paying almost 4 dollars for a plain bacon biscuit you cannot ask for the bacon to be crispy. Also as she finalized my order and asked me if I wanted to receipt I said yes she didn't even say thank you nor employee that brought out my bag with food  Which b0tw I'm going to have to go home and throw the bacon in the microwave to be able to eat I doubt I will be back here again"}
{"text":"Good biscuits. Had the the Kicken Chicken. Great combo of flavors. Long lines, moved quickly. Had a person at the door greeting you. She also was available for questions. I found her very helpful. Hubby had the biscuits and gravy. He raved about the gravy. He also had the smashed avocado toast. He said he should of had it on sourdough. The front house staff was very helpful. I'm coming back to try the roast beef sandwich, it looked so good!"}
{"text":"Pretty much a loss in my books.  Yeah, I'm gluten free and went to a biscuit house. Maybe that was my first  mistake but being owned by Cracker Barrel who has, actually a HUGE gluten free menu with lots of options, I thought this place would have the same.  Nope.  They don't even serve egg whites. I ended up with some sort of brussel sprout salad.  J's biscuit was fine he said but wasn't a huge fan.  The quick casual service was fast and everyone was friendly, so I can't really ding them all the way down. Coffee was good, too! Just won't be running back for multiple reasons."}
{"text":"The name of this restaurant definitely fits the way the chicken makes you fell lol.  Their chicken biscuits will make ya HOLLA!!!"}
{"text":"Awesome food...never disappointed with the chicken holler. Can get it with fruit or Tots, both are excellent."}
{"text":"This place is soooooooooo awesome! The prices are very reasonable and the food is delicious! Would definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"This is just for a To-Go order. Was not happy to find the chicken in my Chicken. Set. Go lukewarm at 9:30 a.m.!?? I hope they did not give me yesterday's leftovers for the price. Also the corn salad-did not seem fresh, quite watery. The items sloppily prepared and thrown in a bag. Always will wait that extra minutes(s) for fresh food. *Shrugs* Will say the runners were very pleasant despite the ordering cashier's nonchalance. No rush to come back."}
{"text":"Great southern food. Excellent service here and a nice variety on the menu. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Delicious!! I ordered the Hollerback biscuit with an egg and charred corn. Everything was so fresh, and the portions were perfect. Also, save room for the $5 beignets with coffee sauce - they are well worth it. Best quick brunch stop in South End."}
{"text":"GIMME ALL THE BISCUITS!  I had this spot bookmarked as soon as it became a yelp listing. :D   Stopped in here about 10:30 AM on a gorgeous spring Saturday. Needless to say, there was still a decent line to order. There was an employee greeting everyone, passing out menus & providing answers to any questions. Their were two employees ringing purchases, so the line moved pretty quickly.  I got the Kickback Chicken with cheese grits as my side. I didn't wait long until the order was ready. SO delicious. The biscuit was HUGE! No worries, I was able to tackle it. The chicken was smothered in honey - which was great, so it took off the heat from the jalapeños. Pimento cheese was yummy, too. The grits were amazing - I'm just greedy & wish there was more in the cup.  Really love this spot & will definitely be back. Friendly employees, reasonable prices. Parking is my only gripe."}
{"text":"Great food fast and friendly!  We are in town for a trade show and didn't want to eat in the food court.  Ventured two miles away from the convention center and found this gem.  Everything we got was hot, fresh and prepared with care.  All of the staff was friendly and the smiles were abundant.  Do yourself a favor, skip the pre-made bagels and get you a biscuit!"}
{"text":"The food was great! Line was out the building when we got there. Wish there was more seating but everyone was friendly and the service was good."}
{"text":"Sooo I guess this is the latest and greatest, hip and trendy scene spot in CLT.  Here's what all the fuss is about...  I've been to Holler and Dash twice.  First time, I searched several minutes for a parking spot, parked, walked-up, saw the ridiculous line, turned-around and walked out.  Second time, a weekday morning, was much better as I was able to walk right in, and order without wait.    I ordered the Kickback Chicken sandwich - as I was told this is their signature sandwich.  After placing my order, was able to find a cramped seat near the bathroom and food came out shortly thereafter (less than 5 min).  The Kickback sandwich was good, I must admit.  That sweet pepper jelly its served with is awesome - wish they would've put about 32 more scoops of that stuff on the sandwich!  The chicken was super tender and succulent.  Biscuit was soft and buttery - a bit dry for my liking though.  The side of cheese-grits its served with, were simply spectacular!   My one complaint is that I tried to sub cheddar cheese (comes on the Chicken Holler Sandwich) instead of goat cheese.  You would've thought I asked for the nuclear launch codes or something!The cashier had to get a manager, delete the order, and finagle around for so long that I just said, 'Forget it', and took the goat cheese it comes with.  So good-luck with trying to modify your order in any way.   With that being said, I'm definitely looking forward to coming back and sampling a few other items on the menu - like the omelette.  I hate to add to the hype and pump-up this place more than it already is, but Holler and Dash DOES live up to the hype! So if you are one of those \"Seen-Heads\" that wants to see and be seen - get to Holler and Dash."}
{"text":"This isn't your grandma's Sunday morning breakfast.. it's better!  I tried Holler & Dash after reading about its opening in one of CharlotteFive's email blasts. Right as we walked in we were greeted by a friendly employee who offered us menus and walked us through popular favorites. I ordered two of MY favorites: gravy biscuit and tater tots. The gravy was better than I could have ever expected it to be.. so good I had it again the same week, but that time with the cheese grits; which were everything I expected cheese grits to be, but better because they were seasoned so perfectly. I also tried to take my mom this past Sunday but the line was out the door for more than 10 minutes and we were on a time crunch for the day.  [The Gravy]: Think Cracker Barrel, but seasoned better. ($4.5) [The Biscuit]: Dense but still fluffy inside (how?!) and nice butter milk flavor. [The Tots]: Just your average tot, but the dipping sauce takes it to another level. ($2.5) [The Grits]: Seasoned. Cheesy. Thick. Heavenly. Great portion for to-go. ($2.5)  The Agua Fresca!!! How could I forget?!?  So, So good. I thought I loved OJ with breakfast, but I was wrong; it's Agua Fresca I love! It's a not-too-sweet, not-too-watery strawberry drink with the perfect amount of slushed ice we all love so much. Wishing refills were endless on this one. ($2.5)  The aesthetic was great; lots of great art on the walls. Plenty of seating for those having a working breakfast. Front area can get a little congested with those waiting to order, enter & exit the restaurant all utilizing the same space.  Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"If you haven't tried Holler & Dash yet, you need to go. It is my new breakfast or brunch spot whenever I'm in town. My sister and I made our way to South End on a late weekday morning, so the restaurant was not very busy (though I've heard it can get quite crowded during more popular times). The location is nice with a parking lot, making it convenient.   The restaurant was really cute and comfortable. You order when you walk in the door, then take a number, get your drink, and find a seat. Even though you order at the counter, someone came by our table more than once to check how everything was and then to clear our plates.    I tried the Kickback Chicken Biscuit based on a recommendation from the worker, and this signature biscuit had already caught my eye, so it felt like it was meant to be. It was a biscuit with fried chicken, goat cheese, and pepper jelly, and I chose a side of cheddar grits. I liked the biscuit and the chicken, but the pepper jelly was the best part. I was a tad worried about how all of the flavors would mesh, but it formed the perfect bite. This sandwich cost $9.50, but I was stuffed for hours after devouring the entire thing so it did not seem overpriced. My sister ordered the biscuits and gravy, and it was also good. I want to try the biscuit with fried goat cheese, kale, and tomato jam on my next visit, which will be soon."}
{"text":"First experience at this new spot on South Blvd and I was so impressed! The staff was helpful, excited and knowledgeable of the menu. I got the Chicken Set Go and cleared my plate in probably 3 minutes flat, it was that good! Get the special sauce for your tator tots if you like a little spice."}
{"text":"Excellent!  A terrific place for a quick breakfast that's flavorful and high quality."}
{"text":"I went to the soft opening this afternoon, and was incredibly impressed with the food and the friendly staff! The menu has something for everyone. I had the Fresh Farm Bowl, and added a piece of fried chicken. Don't forget to try a dessert...you won't regret it!!! This will certainly become a South End staple. I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Holler & Dash is a new favorite of mine. I went for Sunday brunch. Parking is a bit difficult so I would suggest walking or biking. The line was about 10-15 minutes long. But after sitting down our food was out in 5 minutes! I had the Chicken Set Go, a biscuit with pimento cheese and chicken, and it was amazing. At first I thought the portion was small but I was stuffed by the end. I also ordered cheese grits and they were very yummy but also a small proportion.  Inside is decorated really well. Every person working there was so fun and friendly. Really enjoyed it and will be back."}
{"text":"We visited Saturday morning because I was looking for a fun breakfast adventure for the family and a couple reviewers had given it high marks compared to Maple Street in Jacksonville and Biscuit Love in Nashville. There was a little bit of a line, but it moved quickly. Food came out fast and fresh. I ordered the gravy biscuit and it was awesome! Just the right amount of heat and a great amount of sausage in the gravy. One kid had the Strawberries and Dash which I thought was great and but he didn't care of the cream cheese. My other son had the beignets. He loved because of all the powdered sugar, but I was not a fan. Sadly, they were more like biting into a piece of styrofoam. My husband had the Kickback Chicken and it was pretty awesome. He was hoping to find something on the menu similar to the Sticky Maple at Maple Street so he was a little disappointed, but the Kickback was still great. We also got the tots and cheese grits for sides. They were pretty standard. We were disappointed in the coffee. Nothing spectacular, generic regular and decaf, however I did think it was nice they had almond milk and stevia. Would like to see a flavored option or some kind of a house made syrup added to the coffee bar. All other items really had special components ubiquity to the restaurant except this one. They do offer espresso drinks, but we didn't try. Overall, I would come back if in the area, but this would rank number 3 behind Maple Street and Biscuit Love."}
{"text":"They are located in the same parking lot as the new Harris Teeter in Southend, right beside Nekter Juice Bar.  I arrived early morning before work, and I already knew what I wanted and thankfully it was not crowded.   The staff wasn't very friendly but I was in a hurry to get in and out before the crowd got there.  I ordered the beignets, and the grit bowl minus the eggs as they didn't offer egg whites.  It wasn't a very long wait before they were bringing my bag to me.  Everything looked great, the beignets had lots of powder and were pretty good but the coffee dipping sauce that comes with it was a no for me, it started off ok and kind of like chocolate but then the coffee taste and bite takes over.  The grit bowl was really good kind of creamy and good flavoring.  I'm not really big on biscuits so maybe I'll try them at some point."}
{"text":"I'm not a biscuit guy typically but the chicken and goat cheese flavor makes up for it!"}
{"text":"So I'm scrolling through Instagram being all nosey and ish on a Sunday morning and came across a Yelp post about this spot. Hopped on over to the official Yelp place for this joint and saw all these 5-star reviews. Now normally I would just bookmark a new joint or a place I want to try and get to it when I get to it, but I was at my house literally salivating over the pics I saw from my fellow Yelpers. That ain't the norm for me. So I just knew I had to stop at this place on my way to work. Well... it's not exactly on my route to work, but it's close enough.   I figured this place would be jumpin on a Monday morning, being that's it's new, it's the morning, this place closes at 2 PM. NOPE! But that's great for MEEEE! I didn't have time to stand in line. Didn't matter anyway, cause they move pretty fast.   I slide up in this spot, was greeted with a smile, and was squinting at the menu above when the lady at the register gave me a menu to view. I was overwhelmed cause everything looked good (pics from Yelp I mean), and I didn't know what I wanted to try first. Decided to go with what I know. And what I know is cheeese. If they can't do pimento right (cause they advertised it), then I'm pressing on. I know this place is about biscuits, but all the elements have to come together.   Final verdict: They did it right! They did it ALL the way right!   To be honest I'm not a biscuit person, so I have nothing memorable to compare this to, but this biscuit was RIGHT! It was flaky, buttery with a hint of sweetness. I LOVED IT!  I loved the creaminess of the pimento cheese and the few jalapeno peppers for a bit of kick.   The chicken was crispy and cooked just right. I have to say that because of a popular place (that shall not be named) that I frequented often was giving me some undercooked chicken on several occasions. And that's a no-no.   For the price, it's a pretty huge biscuit. So it's extremely filling.   The potato salad was aight. Better than some but not the best. I wanted to try something different and this was different. The flavor was good, but I'm particular with what's in my potato salad. I ate it all so it wasn't bad at all, just not the best. Again, good, just not the best.    But BRAVO Holler and Dash! I'll be back to try another biscuit tho!"}
{"text":"Good biscuits, better sandwiches.  This an excellent restaurant concept. Patrons can enjoy free coffee, the service is super fast and friendly, and most importantly the menu is great. The biscuits are nicely done and the selection of biscuit-sandwiches is great. Super good combinations.   I went the opposite direction, since H&D is known for its biscuits, and opted for a sandwich. I was not disappointed. I got the Raise Up Roast Beef and honestly it might be the best roast beef sandwich I've ever had. I chose the potato salad as a side and it was amazing as well. It's not TOO southern-ish (i.e. loaded with more mayo than one's heart can handle).   Alcohol isn't served here, but that's okay. All that means is the customer turnover rate is pretty quick. With a fresh take on some classics, Holler and Dash is a great fast and casual spot for breakfast or lunch."}
{"text":"Soooo good. It was packed in the place but moved quick. Foos didn't take too long to get to table. Added an egg to my Chicken. Set. Go. Biscuit is dense but good. Pimento was very flavorful and the tots were good too. Definitely a repeat but it's filling. It's not a snack haha"}
{"text":"The kickin' chicken biscuit was so amazing. I really try not to eat carbs, but these carbs were totally worth it. The line was long but fast. My only complaint was that there was nowhere to stand while waiting on a to-go order. I constantly felt like I was in the way."}
{"text":"Wow! Just wow. Excellent biscuits, fun atmosphere, even better food!  I would definitely come back again when in the Charlotte area.    I got the Kickback Chicken Buscuit with fried egg! Amazing!"}
{"text":"It was tasty, I look forward to going back and trying more items."}
{"text":"This is a great addition to the Charlotte breakfast scene. Went with a decent sized group, we all ordered a variety and everyone LOVED everything. The Kickback Chicken was amazing, and their take on beignets with the coffee dipping sauce was a huge hit. I can't wait to go back again and try even more options."}
{"text":"I was very disappointed in Holler & Dash service today. I ordered a grit bowl at 11:58 am, over 20 minutes in waiting for my order, I approached an employee regarding my order. Around, 12:30 pm, I received my grit bowl in a small styrofoam container. I'm not sure why the employee placed hot grits in a styrofoam container because the grits leaked through the container. Typically, the grit bowl is packaged in a large plastic microwave safe plate with a cover; however,  today in came in the same packaging as a biscuit sandwich. I've received subpar service today. I couldn't enjoy my meal with half of the grits leaking out of the soggy container.  I did not receive an apology or explanation for waiting 30 minutes for a grit bowl.  I'm not sure if the supervisor took the day off but there was clearly no order in the kitchen today."}
{"text":"I don't have any ideas why Dash Biscuits house has so many good reviews. I went here and got very bad experience. worst customer service I ever had my life."}
{"text":"Love this concept!! The atmosphere is trendy and buzzing around noon time!! The biscuits are tasty...portions are good! Already my fav is the Grit Bowl!! Coming in strobg 2nd is the  Andouille Hustle!! Great new spot!!!"}
{"text":"Awesome quality food, different menu, reasonably priced! Best cheddar grits in town, huge biscuits. The service is excellent, we literally had no complaints and will most definitely be back."}
{"text":"So this place is BOOMIN right now because we leave in the south and everyone loves brunching and biscuits! I placed an order online and picked it up Sunday afternoon. The online ordering was super easy. Upon my arrival I quickly noted how awful the parking situation is, they share a lot with Harris Teeter in Southend. It's a new area that will continue to develop was I only imagine it will get worse. I finally found a spot and approached the restaurant to see a line out the door. I figured that there was a pick up line so I made my way through. I saw my order sitting on the counter so I stopped a waitress to ask if I needed to wait in line. She handed me my food and told me to have a good day. I felt bad for the poor suckers waiting in line, haha! I will eventually have to return and enjoy an eat in experience to compare.    When I got home I opened up the containers and our biscuits looked amazing!!! I got the pimento cheese chicken biscuit and man oh man the cheese was so creamy! It was perfection! My fiancé had the biscuit with goat cheese and pepper jelly which he was very pleased with as well. I enjoyed tots and he got grits as the side item. We will def return again but it is a little pricey for biscuits.   I'll also note that they have some tough competition with RISE biscuits so close by. I'm from the Raleigh area and I adore RISE so I think H&D has big shoes to fill! I think I would have enjoyed my biscuit from here if it was a little softer, just a tad too crunchy for me!"}
{"text":"Hot spot for breakfast/brunch right now since it just opened a week ago. The line was out the door and we waited probably 15 minutes to place our order which isn't bad as it took less than 10 minutes to get our food. The concept is fast casual. You go to the counter and place your order and are given a number to put on the table. I ordered the biscuit with fried chicken and pimento cheese. My husband ordered the bacon egg and cheese biscuit. We both ordered the grits as our side. The grits did not disappoint. They were cheesy, had a hit of garlic and were thick. we both agreed that they were delicious!  They also offer tots as a side which seem to be pretty popular. We will definitely be back. I think next time I would like to order the beignets which come with a caramel coffee dipping sauce and are only five dollars! If you're craving sweet, they have a biscuit for you. They've got a strawberry shortcake type biscuit and also have one with Jam and Nutella. The coffee and drinks are self serve so you never have to wait for a refill. Great concept all around!!"}
{"text":"Obsessed with this place! The kickback chicken was so good we went back two times in the week  also their homemade jam is seriously underrated. Can't go wrong with anything on the menu, this place is a must try!!!"}
{"text":"Delicious, fun, and a perfect lunch spot.  Big shoutout to their Agua Fresca (for gringos that translates to fruit water) - it was awesome and I've been craving it since I left.  My friends took me here for lunch and it was such a lovely change of scenery (lots of light, cool seating and interesting design).... plus who doesn't love a good biscuit?  The setup is easy; order up front, get a number, and wait until your food magically appears.  I got a biscuit with bacon, fried green tomatoes, a fried egg and guacamole (...and my mouth is watering as I write this review a week later thinking about it).  It wasn't so big I needed to unbutton my pants after, but it was savory and filling.  I wasn't a huge fan of the roasted corn salad... I noticed that no one at my table finished that side... I would recommend skipping that one all together, maybe try the loaded tots instead.  Overall, A++.  I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"It's true, Charlotte is home to some real \"famous Chicken 'n Biscuits,\" but I think the award is currently contested. Damn Holler & Dash, I tell you what, there's some magic going on behind that counter. I guess I should elaborate!  Around here is where I'd typically insert the obvious hollaback one liner. I'll yield to the other reviews, you beat me to it! When you walk in, the warm, natural interior design makes you feel very welcome. Good use of several elements such as stone, timber, and an exposed ceiling give the whole dining area a spacious atmosphere. When I visited Saturday morning it was very clean and ready for a big rush.  Speaking of rush, if you want a calm visit then make sure you stop by as early as possible (they open at 7am every morning). The place fills up very fast. Fortunately they have a TON of staff on hand to handle to the heavy hours.  My first visit I tried one of the signature biscuits: Chicken Set Go! There was a bit of a sticker shock on the price at $9, however once you get it, you'll see that this is no ordinary biscuit. First of all, it's HUGE. I mean the top half of the biscuit is larger than the whole of what you'd get at most places. This particular creation had moist, seasoned fried chicken topped with pimento cheese, pickled jalapeno, sorghum, and served with a side.  It's a winner! Wow, that chicken tho. The chicken was moist, and had the right concoction of spices. Perfectly breaded and fried right on the money. Just the right amount of crunch for a best-case biscuit. Pimento cheese provided a delicious creaminess and the pickled jalapenos the right amount of sour astringency to redline all of my tastebuds. Who knew a biscuit could be this complex, yet all come together to make the breakfast of your dreams? What I thought was overpriced at first all the sudden had a ton of value in size, taste, and presentation.  The cheese grits were very good. A lot of \"Southern Breakfast\" places around here give you a bowl of grits that look almost watered down, for me the thicker the better and here they do it right. Very well seasoned too, which is not always a gimme when it comes to grits. The kitchen staff has really proven themselves with my breakfast.  The only problem for the rest of my day was that I was ready to take a nap about 20 minutes after eating this! Southern comfort meets upscale living, granny got nothing on this."}
{"text":"My husband and I visited last Sunday. I wasn't expecting too much from a fast casual breakfast place, but boy was I wrong. We must have went at a magic time because there was no wait and plenty of tables. He got the hollerback club and I got the pork rambler. Both were good. The biscuits were massive, it was like one whole biscuit on top and bottom (not complaining). The pork tenderloin was a bit tough, but the combo with the blackberry jam and onions was amazing. The tots were good, nothing to write home about though. I do wish they had simple syrup to easily sweeten the iced coffees. Everyone that worked there was really nice and the vibe was very relaxing for a fast causal place. They have ample charging space and the wall sockets have USB plugins."}
{"text":"Charlotte has been lacking a biscuit joint, and Holler & Dash is just what the doctor ordered! The line on a Saturday morning around 10 was 25 people deep, but it moved along quickly. They have plenty of seating inside and a decent size patio with about 10 tables. Since my husband and I walked with our dog we got a patio seat. Upon being seated, one of the employees brought our dog a fresh water bowl. In addition the manager (I believe) came out with a custom Holler & Dash dog biscuit! From that moment on I knew this would be my new breakfast joint!   Our food was brought out to us in under 10 minutes. Nice and made to order. I also started with a coffee, which is brewed locally. Love that!   I decided to go with the kickback chicken biscuit with a side of tots. My biscuit was amazing! The chicken was lightly breaded and had a nice peppery kick to it. The biscuit was soft and the goat cheese paired with the sweet pepper jam was a great combo!!! I even dipped some of my tots in the jam that dropped off my biscuit and it was dynamite. Definitely getting an extra side of it next time! And for $9.5 I left happy and satisfied!! My husband got the hot chicken pimento cheese biscuit, which he really enjoyed - but it didn't compare to mine in my opinion.   Overall great experience at H&D and I can't wait to go back!!!"}
{"text":"I went with my friends for the first time. I was pleased. Pretty pricey, but I don't mind paying a premium for good food. And the staff was friendly as ever! I'll be back."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! Enjoyed it in Orlando and Enjoying it in Charlotte.  My son loves the grits/biscuits!  The jams are awesome as well.."}
{"text":"I finally got to try this place and it lived up to all five stars! I was going to play it safe with a regular chicken biscuit. The cashier convinced me to try their best seller, the kickback. It was so good! I am not a big goat cheese lover but it was perfect with the chicken and jelly. The grits were a lovely addition and we also had the beignets....AMAZING! My sister and I were very happy with the food. Service, and price !"}
{"text":"So glad we have this in the Southend now. Tried these guys out yesterday for breakfast and it was delicious. Both my girlfriend and I had one of the signature biscuits and neither of us were disappointed. I had the fried goat cheese with kale while she had the fried green tomatoes with bacon. Service was very friendly and quick. They were great at explaining the ordering process when we walked in. They were very reasonably priced. We will be back."}
{"text":"This place is trying too hard - blackberry butter?! I ordered a pork chop biscuit. It would've been great BUT, they slathered it in blackberry butter - I've never tasted something so GROSS in my life! My god - why take something great and ruin it! Who needs to change the amazing flavor of butter? You guys are trying to re-invent the wheel - the wheel works fine without blackberry butter. Um, I would like to add that the customer service was great they replaced my biscuit with a plain one and it was delicious."}
{"text":"Holy biscuits. I am so disappointed I live so far from Charlotte that I can't have this every weekend! I ordered the farm fresh bowl and a biscuit with rasberry jam while my beau ordered the chicken set go and sausage egg and cheese. Everything was so delicious, I'm having a hard time finding the right words. The main feature of this place is obviously the biscuits- they are so large, fluffy, and crispy on the outside, soft and flaky on the inside. It just makes you take a second to wonder how much butter is in one biscuit, but you get over that real quick. The second thing I want to highlight is how crispy and flavorful the chicken was. It is the perfect contrast to the soft and flaky biscuit and those two ingredients alone would probably make a bomb sandwich. Lastly, I was really pleased with the jam. The color was bright and almost seemed like it was homemade- I really wouldn't be surprised if it was! I would absolutely go back."}
{"text":"I'm not sure I really get the hype of this place. Maybe I ordered to simple of things where I couldn't really get the main point of it. The avocado toast was not good at all, the flavor was poor, and the toast was soggy. The banana peanut butter toast was good however, just not very toasted bread. You would think you'd get at least two pieces of toast as well, one seems a bit little. But it wasn't bad I guess!   Overall the look of the place inside out is very appealing. They have a good size menu which is nice. I would tell someone to try it, but maybe get something they are more known for."}
{"text":"Ate here when it first opened and it was soooo good!  Kickback chicken and chicken.set.go were delicious.  It was packed but service wasn't too bad for being new.  On my second visit, it wasn't quite as great.  I ordered the Raise up roast beef, which was ok.  I think it was the sauce on it that made it SUPER salty.  The agua fresca was a good choice though!  The wait staff also seemed to be loud and rude to customers this day.  Also ended up sitting by the bathroom, only seat open.  The employees rudely had to crawl into the attic in the doorway there to retrieve additional supplies and proceeded to throw items down.  Luckily we didn't get hit.  I will be ordering to go or the patio from now on to not deal with the craziness inside the restaurant."}
{"text":"Chicken Set Go is such a great combo of flavors. Enjoyed every bite. Was also able to sample the brussel salad, beignets, and corn salsa from my friend's plate. Good options as well."}
{"text":"Out of this world biscuits!! Super friendly staff! The short wait in line was worth it!"}
{"text":"My friends and I met here for brunch and enjoyed ourselves.This place is one of a kind as it offers an assortment of ingredients that top a biscuit.I ordered the Kickback Chicken with cheddar grits. Each bite of my biscuit had a unique flavor!!The chicken was seasoned really well and the goat cheese with jam topped it off just right.My grits were amazing!!!! The consistency was just what I like (not too loose and not too thick).   We went on a Sunday and the line was out the door.However,it moves quickly and your order comes out quick too.Due to their being a crowd,seating was not the best despite outdoor seating.I'm not sure if it was because this place is new or if it was a prime time,but just a heads up!"}
{"text":"This place is great for breakfast.  My kids loving going on the weekend and especially love the beignets.  Great spot!"}
{"text":"This place is the devil! The biscuits are SO good! I'm obsessed with the Kickback chicken biscuit - oh Lordy! Their cheesy grits are also super great. You will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Way better than a Bojangles biscuit!! The biscuits are thick, fluffy, and big. A biscuit with jam or sausage is very filling and enough on its own for breakfast or a small lunch. I got a biscuit with the fried chicken and the batter was delicious and a thick piece of chicken breast. They also offer specialty biscuits with toppings and a variety of sides. Service is fast and casual. Would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Move over Gwen Stefani because I'm \"Hollering Back girl!\"  Holler & Dash has already shown that they are quickly becoming a cult favorite. I've been to Maple Street in Jacksonville, FL and Biscuit Love in Nashville, TN but Holler & Dash Biscuit House puts a true hurtin on their biscuit game!  As other reviewers have mentioned this place gets busy but the line moves quickly and efficiently. They had a gentleman greeting folks at the door and explaining the menu to those who have not visited the establishment yet.   They have six Signature Biscuits which range in price from $8-$9.50 and they come with your choice of side. Their are eight sides to choose from. They also have Classic Biscuits, More Favorites, Sandwiches, Bowls, Sweet Treats and A la Carte sides. Beverages include coffee, tea, espresso, lattes, sodas, juice and milk.  I had several items in mind even though I was riding solo I just had to try a little bit of everything! Foodie much?? I ordered the Chicken Holler with cheesy grits, Beignets with coffee dipping sauce and coffee. I grabbed a table number which goes in the small hole in the middle of your table or booth (they also have patio seating so pup friendly!). Just as soon as I poured my coffee and chose a seat my food was out and dannnggggg did it look good!   The Chicken Holler is a perfectly fried chicken breast with your choice of medium, hot or make em holler sauce, cheddar cheese and pickles delicately places within biscuit heaven. It was glorious! The biscuit was buttered beautifully and the chicken was seasoned and sauced to perfection! The beignets were piping hot and fluffy with powdered sugar on top. The coffee dipping sauce had a delectable chocolate flavor with a hint of coffee, superb! The cheesy grits were remarkable. I. Can't. Even! The coffee was House Blend and it tasted delicious. I was absolutely thrilled with my selections! I annihilated the biscuit and put a serious beating on the cheesy grits and beignets but of what I had left I got a box and a to go cup for my coffee, topped it off and went on about my day.   It's worth noting that this place literally made my Friday. Even though I dined solo I felt welcomed and as though I was hanging out at a friends house. Various staff and managers came around to check on each table. It was a well oiled machine and such a great new addition to the Charlotte area. Can't wait until I'm in town again.  Holler!!!"}
{"text":"Stopped in after the know your craft 5k Saturday. It was busy but the line was not that long. I ordered a chicken biscuit with medium sauce. It was delicious. To go I ordered the smoked turkey club and potato salad. All the items were delicious. Service was quick and easy. I will definitely be returning to try more of their menu items."}
{"text":"Biscuits are great! Atmosphere is nice as well. A hipster biscuit place is definitely a new concept to me...but if I had to describe it that's what it is!"}
{"text":"This is the third time I've been here and it's good every time! I ordered the bacon, egg, and cheese biscuit with a side of cheese grits. I fell in love with the thick cut bacon especially with the homemade raspberry jelly. It was so good. The staff was pleasant and all smiling. They stopped by our table to make sure we were good. I'll be back again!"}
{"text":"Visited Holler & Dash on a Saturday, it was busy as expected being that it recently opened. Staff was nice and greeters were at the at door.  The food was great! I visited with my mom and sister and we all enjoyed our biscuits. My only complaint is that the space isn't all that big, few tables. Parking is easy to come by which is nice. Looking forward to my next biscuit!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went to Holler & Dash last weekend and were very impressed. We are vegetarian and the menu had multiple items we could choose from (we both settled on the garden goat and it was amazing). The service was fast and friendly. We can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"We came for brunch time this morning at around 10am. The line was almost out the door. We were greeted at the front door by a member of the staff who welcomed us and handed us a menu. We stood in line for about 10 minutes.   As we stood in line we had the opportunity to review the menu. It has a lot of options for biscuit sandwiches, salads, grit bowls, and coffee.   Once you get closer to the front you see a display with items that they are selling tshirts, mugs, dog treats.   They had agua Fresca in a carafe for purchase right between the registers. They had two open cashiers which helped with the lines. Given that it's done through an iPad it wouldn't hurt if they added a third (at the beginning while this place is hot and wildly popular). They carried local kombucha and had cold brew on tap.   I ordered the shaved Brussels sprouts salad (shaved Brussels, dried cranberries, apples, and pecorino cheese. I asked them to hold the cheese and add roasted chicken (it's an extra charge to add the protein).   I also ordered a side biscuit. You get a choice of raspberry or blackberry jam.   My husband ordered the smokin turkey club. It looked great.   We ordered a little unconventional here - but we wanted to try the restaurant and still eat healthy. I love that it was possible here!   The salad was good! I thought they went a little light on extra protein. Especially considering you have to pay extra for it. Also, I wish there as an extra crunch in the salad, like a toasted pecan or almond. Just a thought!   The biscuit... was great!!! Large and fluffy with layers --- my favorite!   There is a major focus on locally sourced ingredients. Everything tastes fresh.   I liked that there was a decent sized seating area. The booths for up to 6 people which is really nice.   There is a little bit of outdoor seating - but it was too cold to sit in it when we went.   The decor is really sweet ... lots of sunshine yellow, white and wood. I felt bright and even though you were eating biscuits and fried chicken there was something fresh and happy about the space. Is that weird? Maybe -- but it really had a fresh new feel!!  Another great addition to the ever growing CLT restaurant scene!"}
{"text":"Opening Day can be very tricky and confusing and for the most part everyone should be very friendly and helpful. The real test is down the line if those same employees are as friendly and courteous as Opening Day.   We arrived early expecting long lines, but we were actually the first customers in the place with everyone else awaiting a GRAND OPENING RIBBON CUTTING CEREMONY. Ally who was very friendly and helpful made our experience wonderful!   The place is very nice and the decor is simple yet original. The menu isn't big, but it's sufficient and the food was delicious! We had the Chicken Biscuit of course with tater tots and it did not disappoint. The peach sweet tea was so good I think I had like 3 refills! They also have a unique and refreshing drink called, \"Aqua Fresca\" which is as refreshing and delicious as it sounds! It's Non-Alcoholic.   For new customers they gave out these beautiful mugs and Ally provided the Birthday Girl with complimentary Beignets which were remarkable! Accompanied with a special Coffee dipping sauce.   We will definitely return and highly recommend."}
{"text":"The food was really good, the service was quick and friendly and the prices were very reasonable. A great place for people who want to go to a good breakfast/brunch place but without spending a lot of money and still get quality food and not have to have a long wait. We were really enjoying our experience and already talking about coming back again, until I started eating one of the side biscuits we got and I saw a thick, short and curly hair INSIDE the biscuit. Suddenly, all I could taste and think about was hair in my mouth. I really want to give this place a great review, however just because of my \"discovery\" I have a hard time ignoring it and not mentioning it in my review. I hope that I can get over this traumatic experience with holler n dash with time because I really enjoyed the food here and I do want to go back, but just not so soon."}
{"text":"Holler and dash was pretty good My boyfriend and I went for a date he had the chicken set go biscuit and I had to Hollaback chicken biscuit is pretty good I would definitely go back again it's very clean the line wasn't very long the tots are good as well ..."}
{"text":"Stellar brunch experience. Everything a Southend millennial could want in a biscuit house. If you're really going for it, order the Chicken Holler - fried chicken, cheddar, pickles and medium, hot or make em holler hot sauce. I ordered it \"hot\" and the sauce was so good I took home a bottle - or the Chicken. Set. Go - fried chicken, local pimento cheese, jalapeño, and sorghum. As far as sides go, the baby potato salad is the best, seasoned with dill and a lemon buttermilk pesto, next in line are the cheesy grits and honorable mention goes to the charred corn - super fresh and light great side for a sandwich or one of the bowls.  Hospitality is on point all the way through from greeters to the cashiers to the manager Becky, really a local shop feel.  They serve pure intentions coffee and a selection of house made juices - the Agua Fresca is SO GOOD - a strawberry pineapple and lime juice blend that's perfect for brunch.  Overall my favorite things about this place are the people that run it, Lots of organic options (they make it a point to say everything is non-GMO and their chicken is fed millet grain and water only and everything is trimmed off before they hand bread it and fry it) and the perfectly sized biscuit sandwiches - they're big but you can pick it up and eat it withoute a fork and knife and the biscuits are cut perfectly round so no crumbling happens when you eat it like a sandwich.  YUM. FUN. GREAT LOCATION. EASY PARKING. GO."}
{"text":"Good food and fast! The line was confusing when we first arrived but it moved pretty quickly and there was someone there to explain and help which is always good. I hate I didn't take any pictures of my food before it disappeared but it was nothing short of AMAZING! I ordered the kickback chicken and my boyfriend ordered the one with the pimento cheese . Those biscuits are so flaky and good, the coffee, (don't judge we wanted to try everything), the beignets, the \"Aqua Fresca\", tater tots, that good ol' spicy jelly, it was just all good!! We will be back soon!"}
{"text":"OMG!!! My wife brought me lunch and I was so excited. I have wanted to try this place for some time. Since I am not eating meat at the moment she got me the Garden Goat w/ egg! This selection had so much flavor. The kale and vingarette was outstanding and the fried goat cheese was cooked to a golden perfection. The biscuit was large and fluffy. As a biscuit connoisseur, i had high expectations and this sandwich passed with ease. I will definitely be back to try others."}
{"text":"Hollaaaaaaaaaa (Missy Elliott voice) and Dash right now to this place to get a good biscuit sandwich.  I'm serious.  That is all.  No it's not.  We have more to discuss.  When you open a Biscuit House in \"The South\", we must critique  First, I have a question...H&D, how do you get your Biscuits so fluffy with the perfect amount of density on the inside and golden brown color on the outside without it disintegrating in my hand or getting grease all over my shirt???  Do tell your secret so I can slip the recipe to my grandma and politely tell her to up her game.  Aside from the Biscuits being awesome, so is the food.  I ordered the oats with brown sugar and strawberries.  Pretty sizable portion and made me feel healthy.  Then I dug into Hollerback sandwich, which had some awesome sauce, bacon, fried green tomato and guac.  It was so big that I ate this in two halves and enjoyed it for twice as long.  You get a side with a signature biscuit, so I went with the corn based on the recommendation from the cashier.  She was right.  The flavor was so on point, delicious and refreshing.  This place is pretty casual with a nice outdoor space.  It's a little confusing when they give you a number, and you need to find the small hole in the table to drop in the the number so it stands upright, but the manager came right over to where I was sitting and showed me what to do.  Overall, great fast casual place to grab a filling breakfast or lunch (they serve local Pure Intentions coffee).  Super addition to Southend.  I have no doubt this place will do great.  If anything, they might survive on my business alone."}
{"text":"Great biscuits and friendly staff!!! They are normally really busy but you can get thru the line fast and food comes out really fast as well. My 2 year old loves biscuits and gravy and I normally make them at home from scratch but these she lives as well!!! I also love the grit bowl and the avocado smash toast..."}
{"text":"I'm shocked!  This place was awesome! I was expecting a high class bojangles but it's so good! I got the grit bowl with fried eggs, I tried the holler back, chicken set go and the kickback chicken as well. All were yummy. Chicken set go was the best! The roasted sweet potato is really a kale salad w sweet potatoes and was great too! Only downside is it's too trendy (read popular) so there's a wait. Totally worth it!"}
{"text":"Great lunch spot!! Holler and Dash has only been open a week, but my friend and I decided to check it out after we kept drooling over their Instagram photos. Definitely worth it and up to all expectations! The corn salsa (side item) was refreshingly delicious and the turkey sandwich was great.  Service was also great!"}
{"text":"Been here twice- Food and service were great both times! Recommend the Kickback chicken biscuit!!!"}
{"text":"This place is sooo delicious!  I personally love their Garden Goat Cheese biscuit. In fact I love it so much I have been able to give anything else a try. Their jams and coffee are also super! The staff has always been very friendly and helpful. And the environment is casual and pleasant. Definitely in my top 10 places to eat in Charlotte!"}
{"text":"Brand new at only a month old and already a neighborhood favorite and how could it not be. They are a biscuit house so there biscuits take the center stage but the grits bowl and deliciously good coffee should not be overlooked. Parkings not a problem and the place is clean and has a friendly staff. Visit and you certainly won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"This place was very clean and I even stayed to watch a whole movie because I felt comfortable. The food wasn't as hot as I liked it to be, I do not like my food burning but I do like my food to be hot and it wasn't. I had the Chicken Set Go (I believe that is the name) and it was good. The jalapeño where picked and I like fresh but it's ok. The servers was friendly and the manager even came by and asked how everything was going."}
{"text":"Fantastic service, so kind. The food was really good. Like plate licking good. I also highly reccomend the Fried Green Tomatoes. I will now crave these on the daily...."}
{"text":"Not great food. The biscuits weren't cooked all the way and very greasy. Unfortunately would not recommend"}
{"text":"This place kinda reminds me of a Chipotle. Its clean and minimal menu. The food was fine. The service was nice but the wait time was long."}
{"text":"It was so delicious!!! Love their biscuits with gravy and grits and expect fruits parfait so delicious!!! Yummy!! My daughter and I come afternoon 2ish and it was not that busy! But quickly!! Good!! We will come back with our family!"}
{"text":"So let me start in saying that I would have gone for 3.5 stars if I could.  I struggled between 3 and 4.  The food here we enjoyed.  I thought for the servings, overpriced but very tasty.  The service was pretty awful but I will give them a pass since they have not been open long.  A nice touch was the young girl standing by the door when you come in explaining how everything works and handing you a menu.  You order, get a number and sit.  My wife and I both ordered biscuit sandwiches, sides of fruit and grits for me.  Two lates and you are at $30.  The biscuits were about half the size of a place like biscuithead and pretty much the same price so prepare yourself for that.  The flavors come through though.  I had fried chicken with pickles and American cheese, wife had pork loin fried with grape jelly and onion straws.  A couple of great combos, loveddd them both, wish there was more of them!  All in all, we will be back, I'll just be prepared to overpay."}
{"text":"It's a chain, but doesn't feel like one. Unique biscuit recipes with traditional southern flavors coming through. Loved the chicken/pimento cheese one."}
{"text":"Loved everything about this place. Number one- my sandwich was phenomenal. I got the kickback chicken and it was honestly perfect. The tots weren't anything special but the hollerback sauce to dip them in was great and completed the side. I loved how casual the restaurant atmosphere was. Do not be intimidated by seeing a line out the door- this line is for ordering your food directly. You pay up front and they give you a number/stick thing to set on your table. Food came out super quick. Can't wait to go back again."}
{"text":"We checked out Holler & Dash for their opening and it was great. Their food, service and restaurant were all top notch. I will definitely eat there on a regular basis."}
{"text":"When one is considering breakfast there are a myriad of different directions you could go. Pancakes places, bakeries, a cafe, and so on. But when you find a place that takes everything thing in the freaking kitchen and throws it on a biscuit YOU HAVE TO GIVE THAT PLACE A SHOT.   Now a quick disclaimer, I am not a biscuit fan. They are always too dry and make me choke. They give me flashbacks to church potlucks dinner where some old lady brought ham biscuits that she froze from her wedding reception in 1925. However, my wife is a biscuit fan, and we have a hotel room with no kids for the weekend...so I chose the biscuit place. And I didn't regret it.   These are not funeral ham biscuits. Those freaking biscuits melted in my mouth. I got the chicken and bacon egg and cheese biscuit. Holy crap! Bread never tasted so good! I wish we lived closer. I would hit this place up every Saturday. The beignets were off the hook! And the coffee was amazing. The atmosphere was awesome, I wish we had eaten there, but bringing breakfast back to my wife in bed was a just a little bit better.   If you are looking for breakfast or just freaking good food...go here!"}
{"text":"Dope. Love the \"everyday I'm brusslin\" bowl.  Sucks they aren't open for dinner though."}
{"text":"It's as good as they claim! Literally haven't had a single bad thing here, and we have tried almost everything after coming 8 times. Insider tip: call your order in ahead of time for pick-up and beat the crowds. The way they pack the take out is ridiculously impressive."}
{"text":"Mann, let me holla at you! This place here in one word is fantastic. It was packed because it was new, but it was well worth the wait! I love this place!"}
{"text":"Line moved fast to place your order, got the kickback chicken with the charred corn side and it was fantastic! Our friends got the hollerback club and the hey eddy omelette and said both were great. Their only complaint was the fruit side consisted of only honeydew and cantaloupe. Definitely will be coming back!"}
{"text":"So far I've been here twice and I must say that each experience was amazing! I haven't eaten in as of yet but one day I will find the time to do so. I ordered the Chicken Holler. The Chicken Holler includes fried chicken, cheddar and pickles on a biscuit. I opted for medium. Medium is the mildest of 3 flavors. FYI the hottest is called \"Make em Holler\" lol. I also had cheddar grits as a side. I have to say this before I forget. Holler and Dash is only open from 7am to 2pm  so if you are looking for a late night fix this is not the place to go. If you are looking for Weekend morning breakfast or brunch then yes this is your place! Now back to the regular review. The staff is always friendly and smiling. They are willing to explain the menu to you if you've never been. The food is done in a timely manner. Definitely worth a shot!"}
{"text":"New and delicious in Charlotte. I had the grit bowl and my friend and I shared the biscuits with strawberries. The service was pretty quick even though it was very crowded for a Saturday brunch. I will definitely return for othe menu selections!"}
{"text":"Yet believe the hype of this place. I actually made to visits this past weekend.  The 1st visit I tried the  fan favorite kickback chicken biscuit with that sweet potato salad.  OMG the best biscuits I have tasted. The chicken was cooked to perfection the breading on the chicken was short of amazing. Very well seasoned chicken not oversalted the spices were great the goat cheese with the jelly just amazing flavors all-in-one sandwich. I wasn't a fan of the sweet potato salad but did have a lot of flavor.   Because I was so pleased with the 1st visit I had a second visit and tried the chicken holler went with something a little bit more basic with the side of the cheese grits.  Again another winner just amazing. The cheese on the chicken with the pickle and of course I got the hot sauce on it.  This place does a great job at marrying the flavors and putting biscuits and sandwiches together that just are in harmony.  I also decided to order the beignets on this trip.  They are not Cafe du Monde but I was very pleased."}
{"text":"The chicken is seasoned very well and not salty. The grits were (in my opinion) salty and too mushy.. I'm not a fan of the texture. The biscuit was 'un-exciting' to say the least. If I had to use one word to describe the biscuit it would be 'dry'. Long short, if you are a fan of biscuits then give this place a try... but no need to hurry. Very nice location with plenty of parking. Nice view of South Blvd and HT (Harris Teeter) is adjacent."}
{"text":"The food and experience was great! I had the Hollerback biscuit with cheese grits and it was better than imagined"}
{"text":"Believe the hype! Fresh, moist,large biscuits are spectacular! The service is great! A greeter meets you at the door with a menu to either seat you or bring you your online order. There's patio seating which is also dog-friendly. The Kickback chicken sandwich is really good. It satisfies both sweet and savory pallets. The Chicken Set Go sandwich is good as well. This is the one to get if you like pimento cheese.  Parking is adequate. Be aware that they close at 2pm. Weekends can be quite busy for them so order online if your short on time!"}
{"text":"So yummy! Everything there is sooooo delicious. It comes out fast and the employees are so polite!"}
{"text":"They have a few kinks to work out but overall, fun spot serving up tasty food! We were warmly greeted at the front door when we came in by a staff member handing out menus and when we mentioned it was our first visit, she was happy to explain how the menu worked. It was pretty straight forward -- biscuits are the star but they have other breakfast items like omelets, grit bowls, etc.   While ordering, there was some confusion about my coffee order. (Sugar free vanilla latte with almond milk. I suppose I'm asking for it with such a high maintenance order.) They weren't sure if they had a SF syrup, non-dairy option, etc. etc. Hubby and I asked for the lattes to go but they were brought out in ceramic mugs. They also only have 1 machine so it took a while to get the coffees in the first place. Once we figured everything out, our lattes cost us $12. Next time, I'll stick with water.   We split two biscuits, the Chicken Holler (medium) and Pork Rambler. I was most looking forward to the chicken biscuit but ended up totally falling in love with the pork one. It comes with blackberry butter and fried onion straws. Such a lovely balance of sweet and savory! I had the fruit as my side but should have gotten the grits. I had total order envy watching Ted enjoy his cup of cheesy goodness.   The friend that we were with asked for sliced avocado with her grit bowl and they charged her for it... But, after receiving guacamole instead, and working our way through a few VERY confused staff members, she was told they don't actually have sliced avocado. Makes me wonder where the guac comes from, but I digress.   Again, overall this is a solid spot with really good food! Now that I know to just avoid ordering coffee to save on both time and money annnnnnd once the staff live through a few more weeks of service and learn the product, I think it'll become a go-to spot for us. Welcome to Charlotte, Holler & Dash!"}
{"text":"Real sick breakfast and brunch spot! Flaky chicken biscuit with pimento cheese and jalapeños is the truth!   Beignets are very tasty and come with a coffee caramel dipping sauce.  The tots are solid as a side but go with the grits.  Walk up order style with a number for your table. It was very packed today (line out the door) and we had our food within 20 minutes."}
{"text":"Fantastic new breakfast option in South End with some local offerings (like Pure Intentions Coffee).  The Strawberry and Dash, one of the sweeter offerings, will satisfy any sweet tooth and my non-biscuit pick, the Grit Bowl, was super tasty.  Definitely recommend this fast-casual breakfast option for anyone.  Can't wait to go back and try one of the chicken biscuits!"}
{"text":"Was super excited to try this place. It was pretty busy but the wait wasn't that long. The choices are a little different but they do have some plain options as well.  They are a little pricey but the biscuits are pretty large. So large that I could not bite both sides of the biscuit. The sausage egg and cheese was tasty. The jelly that they have, raspberry, really  completed the meal. The side of tots are a shareable size and come with a zesty sauce. It was pretty good. My sister's biscuit was undercooked and doughy, she was pretty disappointed. I've received reports that the grits are good. Overall, the food was good but not as good as I anticipated."}
{"text":"We are lucky to live in one of the best areas in Charlotte. We are just right across the street from some awesome restaurants. One that just opened in our area called the Holler & Dash has to be one of my new favorites. It is a breakfast & lunch only restaurant. They serve anything from salads to chicken biscuit sandwiches. My favorite would have to be their CHICKEN HOLLER it is fried chicken, cheddar, pickles  and either their medium, hot, or make 'em holler on a biscuit. I personally liked there medium because it was a little spicer than you would think. They have many different sandwiches and sides to choose from. I personally loved the fried green tomatoes. Instead of them giving you one or two, they give you three, which is awesome and a big portion for a side. I also really enjoyed their pickles. The pickles had a punch which was actually delicious. They also sell them by the jar with the cutest mugs ever (Planning on getting both). Holler and Dash is a quick and affordable breakfast/lunch restaurant that is open at 7 AM to 2 PM. You can even order online! The last thing I wanted to add is the fact that they get all of their ingredients from local farms in the south. So although they have 7 stores now, you are still eating locally and supporting local farmers. GO check it out!"}
{"text":"Order at the counter & wait for your biscuits at a table. The goat cheese/ pepper jelly combo was delicious over fried chicken on a flaky biscuit. Also tried the pork chop/ blackberry preserve biscuit and it was great too. The breading was perfect. The lunch menu looked great too, I can't wait to go back & try it!!"}
{"text":"The line goes pretty quick so dont let that worry you, we went around noon and was worried we wouldn't be able to find a table but by the time we were done ordering we found a table. The biscuits are super fluffy moist yet crispy. I loved the sweet and savory concept of my meal. We had chicken and pork which both were super tender and no utensils needed. Super filling!"}
{"text":"SO GOOD!!! I got the bacon egg and cheese biscuit! The biscuit was to die for (especially after the 5k I ran that morning). Granted, they were busy as all hell but that is understandable for a Saturday morning! Even though they were busy, they brought our food out very quickly AND were more than pleased to bring my friend some ketchup back to the table when she asked for it.   Will definitely be back soon!!"}
{"text":"I ordered the kickback chicken with a side of baby potato salad & sweet tea. Everything was DELICIOUS! The baby potato salad has a different flavor than regular potato salad however, it was still really good in my opinion. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Biscuits were hard as rocks. It took 45 minutes to get our 2 biscuits. The atmosphere is good and the establishment was clean."}
{"text":"Delicious!!!!  The kickback chicken was amazing.  It was so filling.  Worth the money!   Employees were super nice and helpful!  Clean and relaxed atmosphere. Definitely going back."}
{"text":"Update- Great customer service!  I went back after receiving Merideth E.'s reply to my initial review below and I got a generous portion of pickles for my biscuit and wasn't charged $1 extra.  Also I had the cheddar grits this time and they were excellent. I'll also add the personnel has been very friendly, helpful, and efficient.  This is definitely one of my new favorite breakfast spots.   Prior review: I had an egg and cheddar biscuit and asked for pickles to be added. The biscuit itself was fluffy and delicious. The egg and cheese were also very tasty and properly cooked. Instead of adding pickles to the biscuit, I was charged $1 for a side of pickles, which would have been fine if I was given a generous portion of pickles, but I only received 3 tiny pickle slices for my pickle up-charge, minus 2 stars for that.  The iced tea was also very good."}
{"text":"Ok lunch spot. Admittedly, I visited Holler & Dash the first week it opened so there were seemingly way more employees than needed, which were all very helpful with upbeat attitudes. Very casual...Order at the register and food brought to table. Biscuit sandwiches seem to be their jam, which is not really mine but found something on the menu that was good. I wouldn't say their food is excellent. It was ok, but again, biscuits aren't really my thing. However, my lunch date had a biscuit sandwich of some sort, which I tasted. It was just ok. Would I go here again? Maybe if friends wanted to go for a quick lunch. Not sure I would go on my own accord but again, it was decent. Didn't knock my socks off."}
{"text":"Posh spot in Charlotte with a phenomenal menu. All I can say is that the Kick Back Chicken is too die for!!!"}
{"text":"Delicious and inexpensive! Great service, great ingredients, and great coffee.  New favorite for Saturday breakfast."}
{"text":"Found this breakfast place on Yelp.  They have been open about a month decided to try it an they did not disappoint.  I ordered the chicken biscuit with a side of fruit. Im a southern girl an this biscuit was perfectly thick an didn't crumble .  I will say me an my friend ordered the beignets now Ive been to New Orleans an Im gonna save you don't get them not even close to the real thing.  If you want something sweet its a sweet treat but its more of a flaky croissant with powered sugar an they serve  it  with a coffee flavored chocolate sauce sorta like Nutella.  They use a few local ingredients they get their honey an pickles from somewhere local NC. .  I cant wait to go back its a must stop for breakfast. There is a juice bar next door looks interesting Nektsr."}
{"text":"Great vibes. Definitely had a lot of positive anticipation coming in. Food was good but tater tots and grits can only be so delicious. Expensive."}
{"text":"I'm drooling just thinking about Holler & Dash's biscuits.  I admit that I went in skeptical after all of the hype leading to its opening. I sneered at the hipster decor and phrases on the wall. But let me tell you, good food is good food and this place is DELICIOUS.  Their biscuits are dense and everything that is good in the world. They are officially My Favorite Biscuit, which is saying a lot. The melted on cheese was excellent, and one biscuit w/egg and cheese left me full for a day of physical activity.  10/10 I recommend stopping by to grab a biscuit. I did go on a Friday morning and had no issue with lines/waits, but I can imagine this place gets crazy on the weekends!"}
{"text":"Super impressed with the customer service!!! Friendly staff and super helpful with questions.  We are a couple of southerners,  so biscuits are our staple. These biscuits were delicious and fluffy.  The beignets were a little greasy and as a Cafe Du Monde fanatic,  I was not a big fan.  Love this place!"}
{"text":"Soooo good ! Avocado toast the tots ask for the sauce for the tots it's delicious and my fiancé has the turkey club and loved it"}
{"text":"This place was a bit busy, probably due to it being Mothers Day or simply because the food is amazing! My family enjoyed the atmosphere, selection of teas/coffee and most importantly the FOOD! This is our new breakfast/brunch spot whenever we come home to Charlotte!"}
{"text":"Delicious biscuit spot. We got the Brussel sprout dish with Cajun turkey, beignets with coffee dipping sauce, tater tot dish, and chicken and pimento cheese biscuit. Everything was so tasty. Love all the flavorful dishes they offer here. The Holler sauce that they serve is so, so scrumptious. I wanted to put it on everything!  It was very busy when we ate here. The line moves kind of slow but the staff are very friendly. The food came out super quick. Love this place. Will definitely visit again."}
{"text":"Oh.  Em.  Gee.  Why? Oh why... did I do this to myself?!?  I can't... I just... can't.  These biscuits are AMAZING... And there are a few vegan/veggie options that look good if it is a \"vegan day.\"  Since this was a new place... this most def isn't a \"vegan day.\"  I got the Garden Goat: Fried goat cheese, kale, lemon dijon vinaigrette, tomato jam.    Oh goodness, it was great.  A THICK biscuit that is oh so fluffy yet holds together the way you need a sandwich biscuit to do so.  The flavor? Buttery (yes, I know that's not vegan) and velvety and just full of some sort of awesome sauce that most restaurants would call a \"proprietary blend.\"  The thick piece of goat cheese was fried to perfection.  I honestly looked at it and thought that it was chicken... and thought \"whelp, its a chicken day...\" because I wasn't going to pass up the opportunity to try this place.  Nope... Cheese!  Creamy... delicious... cheese!  Maybe it is because I only smell cheese once a week that it just seemed awesome, but this was perfect.  The golden crisp crunchy outside was the perfect entryway to the smooth-textured inside of the \"patty.\"  The kale was a beautiful surprise with each bite.  Almost making me think that this was some sort of health-food that I was eating, but in a good way.  The staff were very helpful.  They just opened a few weeks ago and have someone at the door to greet you and guide you through the process.  IDK if that is something they just \"do\" or felt necessary because someone got confused and didn't know where to order.  The process is simple... walk up to the order area, place order, grab number, wait till number is called... Hard, I know.  BUT, it was amazing to see that these people take pride in helping their customers have a great experience.  Price?  What I would expect from any on-trend place with great food.  $9 for a great tasting/sized biscuit and a side.    Check.  It.  Out."}
{"text":"Loved the cream cheese strawberry desert and great biscuits. Very friendly staff. Great thick cut bacon. Pretty much can't go wrong with whatever you choose."}
{"text":"I'm blown away. I've not had such a flavorful biscuit served to me in AGES.   Chicken Holler (medium heat) with Roasted Sweet Potato with Apple and Almond salad.   Let's break it down:  Biscuit: not too thick or doughy, crispy exterior but buttery and juuuuust right. Bojangles watch out.   Chicken: seasoned/sauced perfectly. The sauce wasn't running off the biscuit, it just adhered to the chicken the perfect amount to where I could taste it. Amazing. Great texture and flavor here.   Toppings: I had pickles adorning my biscuit with a slice of cheddar. Sounds average, right? Wrong. The pairing is what you'd called perfection. The spicy chicken paired with the fresh and sweet pickles was such a beautifully paired combination. The cheese was the perfect thickness, too. Married together, it was happily ever after in my mouth.   Side: I looked at the side, and I said to myself \"looks good enough, let's try it.\" It. Was. Delectable. The combination of flavors that I would have never expected were tantalizing my tastebuds! Apples, butternut squash, kale and whatever vinegar that it was mixed with had me wishing that it would never end!   All I know is that I'm looking at my schedule for the next time that I can get myself eating here again. If teleportation was a thing, you know I would already be eating Holler and Dash!   Side note: the name of this place is genius. I'm hollering that it's good, and I'm dashing back as soon as possible. Who knows the real meaning behind the name....but I know what it means to me!"}
{"text":"Staff was friendly and efficient! Delicious food - everything was amazing! Definitely try the beignets and get a draft iced coffee. Be prepared to wait in line as this place remains extremely popular."}
{"text":"Sooo good!  Chicken. Set. Go. Wonderful food, GREAT service!!!  My new favorite place. You've got to come!"}
{"text":"I was there for a soft opening event this morning and I think it will be a great addition to the neighborhood. The event was used to train the staff, primarily front of house, so I can't comment on the service too much, but the food is incredible. My main dish was called (I believe) the Kickback Chicken. It was so good and full of flavor. For a side, I got the fried green tomatoes, but also tried the grits and other sides (can't remember specifically) from others at my table. Everything I tasted was great and if they continue with consistently great food, they will do very well in that location."}
{"text":"Came to Charlotte to explore a new city with my boyfriend and needed some fuel before we hit the road this morning. A couple of places sparked our interests but we just couldn't pass up chicken biscuits. Literally the best decision we made. As soon as we walked in we were welcomed by the nicest lady, I'm sad I didn't catch her name but she asked if we had eaten there before and when we said we hadn't she brought us a menu came around the counter and pointed out favorites. I ordered the kick back chicken (pictured) with red pepper jelly, goat cheese and green onions.. boom most magical combo with crispy fried chicken and a dense biscuit. My boyfriend ordered the chicken set go with smoked pimento cheese and jalapeños also equally good but I'm just such a fan of red pepper jelly. Each chicken biscuit comes with a side and we split them, cheese grits and tater tots.. both amazing especially the grits definitely my next go to. Two biscuits that came with sides came out to 20 dollars and some change but we left stuffed, like almost miserable we were so full. So while it may seem like 10 dollars is a lot for just a chicken biscuit you're definitely not just getting your run of the mill chicken biscuit but a flavor explosion with the perfectly paired dressings on the perfectly fried and baked biscuits. Definitely getting your monies worth here. While we were eating a really friendly man came up to us and asked how everything was, I'm assuming it was the owner or manager but I always like when restaurants do that, plus I was excited to let him know how awesome everything was. Our overall experience was amazing so welcoming, genuine and amazing breakfast. So sad to go back to Richmond and only be able to dream about their chicken biscuits, but next time we are in Charlotte we are definitely stopping here again!"}
{"text":"Good food. Love the diverse menu. Strawberry cream biscuit desert is awesome. Black berry butter jam biscuit is also good. Grits are very good. Oh an evening on my plate was delicious too."}
{"text":"This restaurant has great food and great vibes. My personal favorite order is the Chicken. Set. Go. I am doing this rating after my fourth visit and I always thought the chicken was well cooked. However, my first visit I felt the chicken was pretty flavorless other than the breading. It didn't seem like they brined or much less salted their chicken. Since then it has been much tastier. I love the pimento cheese, it's a great consistency. The sorghum is the final touch that I think takes the sandwich from good to great for me.  I am choosing to give a 4 star rating instead of 5 because I still feel like they have some things to figure out when it comes to service. When you walk in they typically have someone greet you and they are usually delightful. It's at the register and beyond that things need to improve. The cashiers have typically been nice but do not seem to have much knowledge of the food upon asking any questions. At my fourth visit I walked up to the register and the person taking my order said nothing. I actually had to ask if it was ok that we ordered and then continued to ask how their day was. Now don't get me wrong, I am there to eat, not join a social club and I typically don't care about these types of things as long as I can eat some good food. But for an establishment like this in South End Charlotte hospitality is what is needed to take a place over the top. I can go a number of places and get a good biscuit.   When you get to the table you place your order marker in a holder on the table and you wait. Usually someone brings your food out and then you don't see them again, and you don't really need to. Today, our food was brought out by someone with the restaurants telephone in their pocket. It was ringing and I could hardly hear to talk to the server. My biscuit ended up missing my favorite part. The sorghum. I sent it back, they brought it back out quickly and it was great. Missing items has seemed to be a trend in our visits here. Nonetheless, they are happy to make the corrections.   I would highly recommend this place to anyone searching for a good southern inspired breakfast. However, I look forward to visiting once they get into a good flow of customer care and organization when it comes to expediting food."}
{"text":"I've been waiting to eat here since noticing the unusual name of the restaurant trying to guess what type of food was on the menu.  Well, I was totally surprised at the fare served here; a hip southern biscuits combinations with a twist & waves of Flavor breakfast & brunch spot.  Can you say Holler for another biscuit sandwich please and make a Dash to come back tomorrow 'cause they close at 2pm.    I ordered the kickback chicken biscuit w/a side of of cheddar grits..yummy delicious, fast, friendly, excellent service from stepping foot in the door, enjoying every bite of food and drink to exiting.   Rosie B."}
{"text":"Went to go check this place out over spring break, and can say with certainty that it won't be my last visit! Overall, I was impressed, for it being a biscuit spot. Sure, some menu items were a little pricey, but that can be said for really any place, and honestly, the biscuit was freaking good.   I ordered a simple biscuit with raspberry jam and their beignets (initially, these are what drew me in). The person who took my order was friendly and the service itself was rather efficient. The food arrived quickly, and the portions were much larger than I expected them to be. I immediately dove into the warm, flaky biscuit, that was almost a tad underdone in the middle (perfection in my book) and slathered on some raspberry jam. The jam is from a spot in Asheville, and wow, was that the perfect compliment to the doughy, buttery biscuit. I then went for the beignets, which were doused in powered sugar (maybe bordering too much) and was excited to dunk them in the chocolate coffee sauce. I have to admit, I was disappointed in the sauce, with it having almost a burnt taste, but the raspberry jam....well that was perfection on the beignets as well! It was a good, carb heavy breakfast, but an overall tasty treat, and I can't wait to come back and try some other offerings."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious!! The chicken holler is my favorite thing so far. The aqua Fresca is amazing I would recommend asking for it without ice so you can get more in the cup."}
{"text":"I had a little time after an appointment and after looking on Yelp for a restaurant that was near me, Holler & Dash popped up. I am so glad that I decided to check this place out. Upon entering I was warmly greeted and shown a menu. At first I was only going to get something to go, but after having such a good first impression, I decided to eat in. I ordered a sausage egg and cheese biscuit, with a side of cheese grits. I was given a number attached to a small pole. Note: there is a tiny hole in the middle of the table where you place this number lol. I didn't know that at first. After a short wait my food arrived.  It was love at first sight and bite! You could tell this was made with love (it may not have been... but it sure tasted that way). Also, its not many times where I go to a restaurant and feel cool just by being there. I can't explain it, you'll see what I mean when you go. This place is definitely top notch and they go out of their way to make you feel welcome. I don't know how often I'll be in the area, but when I am, I'll be stopping by."}
{"text":"Recently a friend and I went here after church. We arrived around 10am and the place was buzzing but not totally full. We were asked to find a table rather easily. You order at a counter and then someone brings your order out to you. I had the chicken biscuit and added egg and cheese (+$1.50). She ordered a bacon, egg, and cheese biscuit with a side lud sweet potatoe salad. She was underwhelmed with the salad and believed the biscuit lacked some seasoning. It is filling though. We also ordered some benigets. With me being from La. I thought they were good enough to satisfy a fix but could not hold a candle to any place in New Orleans. But I wouldn't expect it to. I may come back again."}
{"text":"We stopped for breakfast here prior to running into the Harris Teeter and were pleasantly surprised to find that there wasn't a line out the door! We were greeted by friendly employees as we came in who handed us menus. My husband had the Chicken. Set. Go with a side of cheese grits and I had the chicken biscuit.   We were able to find a spot to sit at easily. We had several interactions with different employees and they were all super nice. Our food came out quickly and we dove in. I poured hot sauce and honey on my biscuit (it's the best way to eat chicken, in my opinion). It was tasty, crispy and warm. My husband really enjoyed his biscuit, as well. We ran into some friends who ended up sitting next to us and offering tastes of their beignets, which were good.   The negative to me was the size of the chicken on my biscuit, which ended up being similar to a chicken tender. It made the chicken to biscuit ratio off and many of the bites I took were just biscuit because of how small the chicken was.   Overall, I think this spot is a hit and we will be back!"}
{"text":"After all the promos and build up, I was beyond excited to try this place.  And it did not disappoint.  I liked that the location has a parking lot thats shared with Harris Teeter.  And they have 15 minute parking for those doing take out, which is what I did.  I was greeted as soon as i walked thru the door.  The decor and friendly staff was great.  I ordered the chicken holler with medium sauce on the side, and a side of cheesy grits.  I also ordered the chicken set go with a side of fruit for my husband.  After placing my order, they gave me a huge table number to hold.  That's probably a little overkill for to go orders as i sit with this tall table number stand.  Once they called my number, i checked to make sure everything was correct... And to my surprise they forgot to put my sauce on the side.  I have the same issue when i go to Rise, which makes me believe that it's the type of register that they are using.   Or maybe it's just a human mistake.  I sure hope that this isn't the norm.  But considering that it was only 2 other customers in the place, I'm not sure how they could have missed it.  Now, for my review of the food... the chicken holler was good, but the chicken set go was outstanding.  I almost wanted to switch biscuits with my husband.  The cheesy grits was ok.  It wasn't better than the flying biscuit or big view diner grits.  Overall, i will certainly visit this place again and probably really soon, as in next week.  :)  staff... Please don't forget my sauce when i do come back."}
{"text":"I went in on a Sunday morning and the line was nearly out the door. An employee handed us menus and directed us on where to stand to join the winding line. The line moved quickly, we ordered, found a table, and waited for our meals which came out soon.   Thoughts: -Don't be deterred by a long line. It moves quickly and service is quick! -Staff do a great job of cleaning tables quickly to allow guests to sit at a clean spot.  -The restaurant just makes you feel happy - from the cute signage to the yellow, fresh interior. Eating here just made me smile. -The portions are large and the food is delicious! We all loved what we ordered - multiple biscuits, a salad, and a sandwich. -This would be a difficult place to bring a group of more than 6 unless you are willing to split up.  -It seems the earlier you come, the better if you want to avoid the crowd! -Shoutout to the staff - they were energetic, pleasant, and helpful!!"}
{"text":"While in town came here for dinner. The drinks were good the food was good the atmosphere was upbeat and modern. There was quite a wait but well worth it. Tried the chicken strips and I highly reccomend. Also their sides were very yummy. Dont go without getting a pims cup and a punch bowl!"}
{"text":"Went with a group of friends for brunch and it was very good. The restaurant was packed which made it hard to find a table. (Doesn't help that it was raining so the outdoor seating was closed.) I got the kickback chicken biscuit and the sweet pepper jelly was great. I recommend trying this brunch spot out, but be ready for a packed house."}
{"text":"The reviews don't lie! This is our 3rd time....in 1 week....coming to try these biscuits and all were on point! The sausage egg and cheese was probably the best I've had in years... I highly recommend getting here early, or using their online system because the wait can get long after 10am-ish. The kickback chicken was amazing, with the hot sauce just right. The only thing I wouls maybe leave off next time are the pickles (I love pickles tho). The pickles are a little thick for that biscuit for me, but I'll gladly eat them on the side. Can't wait to come back and keep trying new things here!"}
{"text":"Fast casual brunch. This place offers the charm of southern food without the pretentious pricing and overly hipster food items of other brunch locations.  The prices are reasonable and the portions manageable. The food was interesting and appropriately brunchy.  The coffee was good and well priced.  The only bad thing was their overuse of plastic containers despite being dine in, and a mishap where they ran out of coffee."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to go right now. The Beignets are to DIE FOR! The set up is awesome, has wifi, and the every biscuit sandwich i have eaten is incredible!"}
{"text":"Yummy! A lot of great things about this place. The employees are very friendly- greeting you as you enter. The food tastes wonderful! The chicken biscuit was so tasty and the biscuit itself was dense and didn't fall apart. I prefer this for biscuit sandwiches. It tasted really good. I had the cheddar grits and they were delicious. My only critique is it would be nice if they were in bowls - and a little larger of a side. It's in a little plastic cup which seems wasteful. Good amount of seating and lots of parking! Will be back!"}
{"text":"Staff was very friendly. Food was awesome. I had the tot bowl with a side of fried chicken and an aqua fresca. I meant to take a picture but before I knew it, my plate was empty! Definitely coming back."}
{"text":"Yum yum yum!! I love this new side of Cracker Barrel.  In case you didn't know, their parent company is Cracker Barrel and I think this is a very smart business move for the comfort food chain.  I had the chicken biscuit with pimento cheese, jalapeno, and sorghum sauce.  So good I practically licked the plate.  My husband went with the grit bowl and I was hard pressed to find a favorite between the 2 dishes.  My son had the chicken biscuit and again ate every bite.  We loved the casual style of restaurant and I really like the self service coffee bar. I definitely want to go back and try some of the other signature dishes."}
{"text":"This place made me write a review and sign up for yelp. I went to the first Holler and Dash when they first opened Just outside of Birmingham AL. At the time the menu was small but I loved everything we had there. I moved away to Texas shortly after that and have found myself living in Charlotte now and I was so happy to see this when I drove by this morning. I just had to go in.  They have come a long way since that small little building they started in and so has the menu.   I won't upload any pictures because I feel my photos that I took will not do what I had any justice at all and that's on me not the way the food was presented.  I ordered peanut butter toast with nanas. Pretty boring right. Nah that peanut butter and the honey that was on it was amazing. The crunch of the chia seeds added to it very nicely.  Next I ordered the Raise Up Roast Beef. This is a bit pricey and maybe the highest priced item on the menu but well worth it. I loved every bite. No really It upset me that I finished it.  For a side I got the sweet potato salad.  I'm not gonna say it was not good but I feel the sweet potato was a little on the hard side and got lost in the other ingredients with it. Over all it's slight drawback for a side (next time I'll get the corn stuff ) but this just might be a personal preference. We ended with the Beignets which are just as good as the last time I had them and was happy to see them still on the menu. Love that Coffee dipping sauce.  My other issue was not about the food but with the building. When we were ordering it was tough to hear and for us to speak so she could here us clearly .Hopefully they will add some stuff to the walls and floor to help dampen the sound.  The staff was super friendly and very patient with us as we both were trying to figure out the menu and what we wanted.   I want to thank the Manager/management who approached us like they new us. It was very welcoming experience.  Pretty sure I have found My Sunday place."}
{"text":"After two visits I'm a fan! It's like a fast casual restaurant where you order when you walk in and can either dine in or take it to go. My first visit I walked in and was greeted at the door by a friendly smile and a menu. The line was pretty long but could tell it was moving and plus I needed the time to decide what I was going to get since they have a lot more than just biscuits. I ordered the grit bowl to go and I'll just say it didn't make it out the parking lot it was so good.  Everything about it made a perfect combination. My second visit I was again greeted by a smile and there was no line, both visits were on a Saturday morning, but shortly after I ordered it got packed. I went for the Hollerback Club because I wanted to try a biscuit this time. But to my surprise when I ordered the cashier asked would I like it on potato bread or a bed of kale, since I just left the gym I went for the bed of kale. I love that they have healthier alternatives and it was so good. I cleaned my plate whereas I think I probably wouldn't have eaten much of the biscuit because my friend didn't really eat the biscuit just everything else. The fried green tomato and the Hollerback sauce were so good and they have really good grits."}
{"text":"Food quality not great. Staff could have been more helpful. Especially for a first time visited. Didn't receive much input from staff."}
{"text":"This place was such a great find. We arrived and the place was busy!  But we were greeted as soon as we walked in and the line was moving quickly. The staff was friendly and very welcoming. We placed our order and found a seat, we were given a number. The server brought our food to the table within minutes. And everything I repeat everything was delicious. I opted for the avocado toast and tots. And everyone in my group loved there meals. The beignets are light and fluffy and the coffee sauce was amazing. I definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"Amazing food. Who knew biscuits could be this good. Layers of awesomeness stacked up. Get the beignets, no matter what."}
{"text":"I had the kickback chicken biscuit and it was amazing. Great biscuits just the way I like them. The cheese grits were awesome as well. This is the type of place you'll be saying next time I'm going to try that. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"So much YES.  My whole family and I went to Holler & Dash and could not get enough. It was great with so many people because we were able to try a little bit of everything...here is what we ordered:  Raise Up Roast Beef--this is HUGE, you could split this between two people easily. The flavor was awesome.  Pork Rambler--really yummy, the blackberry butter truly makes the flavor profile what it is.   Garden Goat--perfect for vegetarians, the fried goat cheese paired with the tomato jam was amazing.  Avocado Smash Toast--first off, this was so beautifully presented. Really great if you're looking for a lighter option.  Holler Back Club--fried green tomato (yum!) and the holler back sauce make the  best combo.  We also had baby potato salad, roasted sweet potato and beignets which were served with a delicious coffee based sauce.  Everything was cooked perfectly, presented well and tasted great. Trust me, this is worth the wait in line--you need to check it out!"}
{"text":"Small, cute spot. I had the garden biscuit and it was excellent. I had the grits as a side.   I am grit fanatic and they were real aight. Like I wouldn't order them again. They were not cooked all the way so it was a little crunch which is a huge no no when you know how grits should taste. Wasn't cheesy and just lacked any flavor at all. It is a science to cook good grits so I don't expect most places to make them well.  I got the tots as an extra side and they were good. The dipping sauce was gross. I was expecting something different as I read the reviews on here were people said it was good.  All in all I would go back and just get a biscuit."}
{"text":"Randomly decided to stop in here after a morning of rock climbing. This is a fast casual restaurant; order at the counter, get your number, and a server brings you your food. The staff here was extremely friendly. It seemed like everyone here was genuinely wishing me a great day!  As for the food, I ordered the Kickback Chicken, and my friend ordered the Pork Rambler. I never would've imagined fried chicken, goat cheese, and jelly would work together, but it does!  I also was able it try some of the Pork Rambler, which was also delicious.  Holler and Dash offers some unique flavors with their biscuits. I would definitely recommend this place, and am really curious to try their other biscuits."}
{"text":"Not sure what all the hype about this place is...I don't get it. Placed my order online to avoid the prolonged wait that I've heard so much about. I was given a pick up time and went in about 5min after quoted time...the place was busy there was a line...but there was no indication as to where to pick up online orders...when I asked one of the workers she responded rather curtly \"If its ready it'll be right there\" she explained as she just nodded to a small counter area. As I was waiting I noticed a severe lack of front of house management...there was one person working the register and one girl \"running\" food to the tables. The kitchen looked like it was staffed by a small army of cooks and people assembling the food.  After about a 10min wait...which wasn't too bad I got my food....I ordered the Chicken Hollar,medium with a side of the roasted corn salad...while the chicken was cooked very well and was juicy it was just your basic buffalo chicken sandwich on a  biscuit and I would avoid the corn salad...no flavor or seasoning whatsoever. I also ordered a basic sausage,egg and cheese biscuit..the egg was fried beyond recognition and the sausage seemed to be cooked even twice as long.  All in all I would not go out of my way to eat here again....and I think I'll just stick to Bo Jangles for my biscuit fix."}
{"text":"The Chicken Set Go was amazing.  The pimento cheese, jalapeños, and honey made for an excellent combination.  I will definitely be heading back soon.  The cheddar grits and tater tot's we're also very well-made!"}
{"text":"I don't really get the hype. Ordered the Chicken Holler. Too much sauce, chicken and biscuit we're both soggy. Sauce itself was not very good."}
{"text":"Loved this place! Simple, quick, and easy. Food was great. Coffee was fresh. Service and price were great too. Came in from out of town and was told to try this place- wasn't disappointed at all. Would deff give this place a try if you are in the area."}
{"text":"Biscuits were on point, and the cheese grits were very good. I also enjoyed my iced coffee. Bonus star for being extra dog friendly on the patio."}
