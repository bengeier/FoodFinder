{"text":"This was probably my favourite neighborhood chinese takeout. Seafood and veggies are fresh Quantity is large and food is flavourful. Would have given it 5 stars but in my last visit, the pineapple in a dish tasted horrible, in fact I think the pineapple was rotten, I expected them to change it as soon as I complained, since this was my first complaint in more than 8 years of frequenting the place, but they made an excuse and refused to admit the pineapple had gone bad.  I will probably go back but cannot rate it too highly any longer"}
{"text":"Added more to our order while waiting for our food, was told I was 3 mins past 3 o Clock. I told the waitress that I had already placed our order and was trying to get her attention for the past 5 mins. She did not look happy. Got the take out meal - It was 90% rice and a surprise GUM SPIT into my meal. The fact she told the time to spit gum into my food cause I added an order 3 mins late but the food had to be thrown out."}
{"text":"I have very bad experience to take a lunch in this restaurant today. The food is terrible. The service is very bad too. They did not respect their customers."}
{"text":"Foods bland and the people are just as bad. I've ordered takeout three times from this place and each time there was something wrong with our order. Not to mention that when you call to ask a question they give you some pretty dumb responses. Most recently I called to ask how big their Sea Food soup was. Small, medium or large would have sufficed. It instead they tried to be smart about it and said \"how am I to show you the bowl through the phone.\" I simply wanted to know if it would be enough as a meal for my wife.  Decided that it's better to simply drive the 25 minutes to our old area to pick up good Chinese food."}
{"text":"I've never been disappointed going to China Chopsticks. I go for lunch with co-workers once-and-a-while; it's always delicious and always a decent price.  If you haven't tried it, I recommend it... I love the General Tsao Chicken and the Sesame Chicken."}
{"text":"TERRIBLE. I put in a dietary request to cook separate from all meat (sensitivity to pork) and in the bottom of my container there was small pieces of meat. NEVER GOING BACK. DO NOT RECOMMEND."}
{"text":"Extremely rude service while placing a phone order. When wanting to add/change something to my order calling back after not even two minutes, was told that it was impossible to change the order in a rude and loud tone.   Phone was placed down for a couple seconds without notice, could hear shouting in the background, then asked what my new order is. Felt discouraged to re-order and cancelled the order entirely.  Not a fan of rude and impatient customer service."}
{"text":"As someone of Chinese descent, I am super picky about Chinese American fast food.  Make no bones about that point as China Chopsticks serves exactly that for those who think this is authentic Chinese food.    Having said that, the fried rice, beef and broccoli, obligatory sweet and sour chicken are okay.  They use real vegetables including baby corn, broccoli, water chestnuts and mushrooms instead of the cheap cabbage carrot onion filler that some call veggies.  The chow mein has been decent when I tried it.  They have a special offer of free wings or some other side if your order is more than $25 and the spring rolls are okay.  Not bad deal for those nights when you're too lazy to cook one thing never mind 3 or 4 dishes!"}
{"text":"Honestly the soup is really good and they give you a huge portion. The general tso chicken is pretty hype also. The prices are decent. Great for takeout or just hanging with friends when you don't want to spend more than $10-$15, but don't expect to be transported to china with every spoonful."}
{"text":"Very bad experience and will never order again :(. We called and ordered and the lady told us 20 to 25 minutes, but when we got there they told us another 20 minutes. We waited there for an 1 hour and 15 minutes for our food because they were very busy that day, so we didn't say anything. When we got home, we started eating and found a black hair in our food and immediately called the restaurant , and they offer to delivery another one to us. The other food was very watery, and the sweet and sour chicken was still a little pink inside and the sweet and sour sauce was very sweet :/. We will not be back."}
{"text":"This has been the 4th or 5th time I've ordered food from this place mostly because it's on the way from work to home.     I like Chinese food and my wife is indifferent about it, however the children like the 'red chicken' (General Tso).  I think this is the last time we'll ever order from this place again, it has continued on a theme of questionable meat, mushy vegetables, watery entrees."}
