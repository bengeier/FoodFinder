{"text":"If only I could write out the sound Homer makes for donuts.... absolutely everything I have had from this company has knocked my socks off!  Being gluten free now my choices are more limited but that's OK I am still a happy customer.  Most other choices out there just don't do it for me.  Having been everything from raw foodist to vegan for 12 years and now omnivore with gluten limitations I have tried every thing there is to try.  Way to go SFRT!"}
{"text":"These guys used to sell their cheesecake at Fresh. When Fresh stopped carrying the cheesecake, I went on a mission to find them! They make the best non-cheese... actually the best cheesecake there is anywhere! AND you can freeze it. Doesn't change the taste at all!

Soooo good! 

Now I just order my lovely cheesecake from them directly!"}
{"text":"LOVE LOVE LOVE their products!!!!

Their treats are a must try for vegans, and the gluten-free peeps!! 

My favourite is their chocolate fudge cake. When I first tried it I couldn't believe it was vegan - it was fabulous!!!!!
Their carrot cake is also very good, as are their cheesecakes. THey remind me more of the 'no bake' cheesecakes rather than the dense ones. But still very good.
Their cookies and bars are also great too.

I have served their cakes/cookies to my non-vegan friends in secret, just to prove to them that vegan dessert does not mean bad - they all loved the fudge cake, and were very suprised a cake could be so good without any dairy in it."}
{"text":"I love their stuff, it barely tastes \"vegan\".
Except.. it's so high in calories. Honestly, I wish it was lower in fats and calories, I would be a much more regular customer."}
{"text":"I'm surprised I hadn't heard of Sweets From The Earth, being I'm a frequent visitor to several of their distribution locations.  But I guess that just goes to show you that taking the time to be a vendor at events like the Toronto Vegetarian Food Fair will help raise awareness to your product.  

This stuff was so MOIST and DELICIOUS.  I wanted to try one of the muffins, but sadly there was but one left, and by the time I lifted my camera to photograph it, it was gone.  But that should tell you just how delicious it was, right?  Yeah, I thought so. 

The products are a bit pricey, and I can only imagine what they'll be like when purchased under a store's markup, but I'm still going to take a look next time I'm at my local grocery store.

My suggestion is to take a look at their website, find a location near you, and pick up a box of whatever floats your boat.  Mmhmm."}
{"text":"This should have been a 5 star review but it is not, for reasons to come.
Let's start with their masterpiece, the Blueberry Non-Dairy Cheesecake. OMG. To die for. There was a time when there was more competition in this niche but these guys seem to be the last baker standing, and this item is exceptional, with balanced flavors and great texture. Speaking of balance, it is hard to believe that the same people who brought us the Blueberry cake also churned out the non-dairy Chocolate and Mocha cheesecakes. Ugh. Not in the same league. The latter use an overwhelming crushed Oreo cookie crust that pretty well beats the other flavors into submission.  Submission as in MMA match. The overwhelming crust makes for an underwhelming product in both cases. Shame. Other baked goods are merely normal, with nothing to brag about. But the BB Cheesecake is good enough to found a dynasty on."}
{"text":"many of their desserts are sold in other retailers...
with that being said, one of the best muffins I've ever had (not a huge muffin fan) but boy oh boy lol
I had the chocolate chip banana peanut butter one.... and wow."}
{"text":"I love their products. Especially their vegan blueberry cheesecake. My one concern is if the cakes are suppose to come frozen or refrigerated? It seems to vary from store to store. At Big Carrot they seem to defrost it there and leave it out for a week or more, which makes the quality of the cake go down."}
{"text":"Okay. So, I have to do this again. Apparently you can't write about \"extraordinary\" circumstances, and they have complained about me. I'm not sure why I can't -- I still got a sharp needle-like object in my gums from one of their cookies, and they haven't done anything to rectify it, but alright, I'll follow the guidelines.

So, how does it taste? It's hard and brittle, yet somehow a bit too chewy, and overly sweet. I didn't much care for it. I've had better. I admit, for a vegan cookie, it isn't bad, but it's not a product I would buy again for the taste. Maybe they could do a reformulation. 2 stars at best. That's based purely on taste and has nothing to do with ethics or this company's image."}
{"text":"Before I moved to the city, I would stock up on Sweets from the Earth treats when I visited Toronto. My favourite is the caramel pecan bar. Now that I live in Toronto I am amazed at how accessible a Sweets from the Earth fix is. I can literally walk 2 minutes down the street and pick up a cookie at the grocery store. I thought the novelty of them would wear off now that I can get them whenever I want, but I still constantly have Sweets from the Earth cookies and bars stashed in my purse and in my pantry at all times. You never know when you will need a sweet fix :)

I am vegan, but my family members are not. So when it comes to family gatherings at Christmas, I usually bring one of the frozen cakes/cheesecakes for myself and sharing. They are always a huge hit! All of my family members have been impressed with their products.

Last year, when Sweets from the Earth offered a special package of goodies for Veggielicious, I stopped by the head office to pick up an order. The staff were so friendly and nice. I cannot say enough about how amazing and fresh everything tasted when ordered straight from the bakery. Their stuff is ALWAYS delicious, but to actually try their products straight from the bakery was a real treat.  

I love seeing Sweets from the Earth at events like the Toronto Vegetarian Food Festival where they often have special items for sale. This year I got to try their croissants and a s'mores cookie and I was blown away! I really hope theses products become widely available and that Sweets from the Earth continues to bring out new items. I have yet to try packaged vegan treats better than what Sweets from the Earth has to offer."}
{"text":"Like some of the others, I haven't been to this location but I did try one of their products, which I bought from Ambrosia Natural Foods. I had to check them out, after the people on the Toronto Vegetarian Assoication raved about their food.

I got the Chocolate Fudge Cake. And it is really delicious, rich & very chocolaty. Even hubby, who's an obstinate carnivore liked the cake. I have to say though, i can only eat a bit at at time because it's very rich for my stomach. This is probably a good thing, otherwise I would eat it too fast & finish the whole cake in a minute!"}
{"text":"While I haven't visited this actual location, I've had the pleasure of purchasing many of the delectable delights from Sweets from the Earth at the Big Carrot.

Sweets of the Earth  is a Toronto based all natural, 100% plant-based, GMO-free ingredients brand of desserts that is remarkably delicious given that I've had so-so experiences with vegan and gluten free supermarket desserts in the past.

So far I have tried 4 products from SOTE and they include

1) The moist and sinfully rich Chocolate Fudge Cake which is tinged with the flavour of coffee

2) The Double Chocolate Cookies, a little hard but notably doubly decadent in it's chocolate chipped splendour

3) Vanilla Cupcakes simply marvellous and hold their own against any of the myriad cupcakeries that churn-out egged or butter creamed versions.

and 4) tonite I tried the Wild Blueberry \"Cheese\" cake for the first time and let me say it was above and BEYOND what I expected a non-dairy cheesecake to be...Carol's Cheesecake can suck it, because the Sweets of the Earth version lets me indulge in creamy decadent dessert heaven without the hellish consequences of bloating, heartburn and indigestion.

So if you're a vegan who loves desserts and moreover if you're sick of the way that dairy/egg based desserts make you feel like crap after eating them  Sweets of the Earth will finally let you have your cake and eat it too  :)"}
