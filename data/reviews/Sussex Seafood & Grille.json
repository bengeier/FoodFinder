{"text":"We had heard about this place as having the best authentic fish and chips in town. In fact the fish and chips were indeed excellent! 
The banana cream pie was delicious too.
We will return in the future with our family."}
{"text":"Best crab legs in Cleveland, hands down. Service can be kind of slow but well worth it. You can go all you can eat for 39.99 bit I find that the 2 pounds for 28 bucks perfect. Their sides are a bit small and the salad is just lettuce, onion and cheese but that is not what I go there for. The new owners really have stepped it up.
I could eat here all the time but then  I would be 300 pounds...
The chocolate peanut butter obsession cake is eyes roll in the back of your head amazing!"}
{"text":"I've been to Sussex's a few times now and I have become a fan. Crab Legs, Seafood Pasta, and the Scrod are all good. Staff is friendly and helpful. The restaurant has an old school feel to it. I guess there is a reason they have been open since 1939."}
{"text":"Saturday may 7. Had reservation hostess acted confused, place. Was empty, took fifteen minutes for a server to wait on us, another 15 to get drinks,  she forgot utensiles,  food not that good, music too loud,  will not return"}
{"text":"Crab cakes were the best we've ever had. The famous fish (haddock) was grilled with lemon pepper spice and was terrific. We had the green beans with almonds,  Cole slaw and salad. Everything was great, fresh and service was quick and friendly. Only complaint was that the salad had cheese on it, but that is just a personal preference. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Sussex is consistently a good choice.  The food is always good, served hot and just the way you ask for it.  The service is always friendly and efficient and the restaurant is always clean.  Fair prices for a generous serving."}
{"text":"Went there last Friday with my girlfriend for my birthday.  We were both looking forward to going and having their fish.  What a disappointment.  We ordered the traditional battered fish.  I had the homemade chips on the side.  The ends of the fish were good, batter did not sick but I overlooked it.  But when we both got to the center of our fish, it was not done, mushy and oily.  The homemade chips I got were floppy and soaked with oil, NOT crisp.  The server was good and tried to help, but at the point we both lost our appetite, then the owner came over to apologize.  Not sure if and when we might go back.  Happy birthday to me, having a queasy stomach was not a good birthday present."}
{"text":"We have been to Sussex 3 other times and we thought we found a great place for crab legs, today we went for the fourth time to celebrate and wish our very good friend on her move to Texas. We all ordered the crab leg all you can eat meal and everything went down hill from there. It took a little while to get our first set of crab legs. We told our server when they finally came out that we were serious crab leg eaters and to get the next clusters cooking, she was very hesitant, but said she would. The second set of crab legs came out, one cluster of legs for each of us, we asked for the little forks to help get the crab meat out and we had to go to the kitchen/bar and ask again. We had finished off that cluster of legs in no time and about 15 minutes later another set of one cluster each came out. 15 minutes later we finally got our 3 set of crab legs and they were still partially frozen and cold, we asked to speak to the manager, the manager came out another 15 minutes later after we asked to speak to the manager again, she was worry and they were really busy ( there was hardly anyone in the restaurant ..it was not that busy) she basically shut us down from complaining and finally got us our butter and another round of drinks, and our next set of clusters came out like they were from a rejected crab shack, the next basket came out and everything was pieces parts, the waitress told us that we were getting the bottom of the box, seriously, we got every little piece they could find, it was ridiculous. We kept eating and asking for more clusters and they must have found the new box because they were ok. Our server came out and said that they wanted to giVe us each a free dessert we all declined a. We were really embarrassed and felt bad that our friend had such a disappointing send off. As we finished our meal the manager came out and tried saying that she was sorry for all the confusion, and that she did not try to shut us up, we told her that is what ur felt like. And we also said that we would not be back. She said right back to us, that that was OK and we were talking shit about her behind her back, we didn't, we told her right to her face.

Who wants to pay $49 for all you can eat crab legs and wait 15 minutes to get refilled and be given the bottom of the box, seriously, this was the worst. If you come her expecting crab legs, you will get very little and the quality will be a gamble, you will wait for service and you will get clusters that look like they were factory seconds.I don't know what happened, but it all went bad. Go to Pickle Bills in Grand River, you won't wait for crab legs!

Will not return ever, if that was a manager, she was the worst example of someone who cared.

?ot for serious crab lovers"}
{"text":"This place is a real disappointment. I paid $60.00 for all you can eat crab legs and every batch was absolutely disgusting. Even the knuckles (the part that attaches to the body) were hollow and meatless. Every single batch that came out were gross and I wouldn't feed them to homeless people! The same goes with the ones my friend got. I will never go back to this dump and I suggest whoever reads this does the same.
I took a picture of the sick and disgusting crab legs they gave us for $60! It's a shame I can't post it. 
Words will never describe how much of a disgusting ripoff this place is."}
{"text":"I have nothing but good things to say about this place. We were a little disappointed that they are temporarily not offering all you can eat crab legs, but Barb our waitress explained the issue with the shortage. The food was absolutely delicious, Barb was super attentive, friendly, and gracious to us. We had two small children who, let's be honest, can make a mess. Everyone in the restaurant was wonderful and even the chef came out to say hello to us and talk to us. Great food, better atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Solid food. Service was good. Decor needs to be refreshed. Some of the best coleslaw i have had. Crab legs a hit with my wife and the garlic shrimp a hit with me. The steak fries were real good. 

A safe recommend."}
{"text":"Fantastic service from Loretta..fish was nice. Baked NOT fried with surprisingly yummy broccoli.  Tasty (and healthy) meal, enjoyable."}
{"text":"Stopped in for dinner on Saturday night. It was fairly busy, we were seated right away. Asked to be seated away from the live light rock guitarist. He wasn't super loud & I love me some Cat Stevens, so it worked. The decor is dated, however, it's clean & adds to the charm.  We were mesmerized watching the fish in the framed fish tank at our table. Began with the fried cheese & shrimp cocktail. The cheese was hot, crispy & gooey, really good. The shrimp cocktail was also good. My husband had the fried shrimp, I had the battered fish & chips with an add on of crab legs. The battered seafood was spectacular. It's a light crispy tempura batter. Perfectly seasoned. It was absolutely fantastic! The crab legs were a bit over done, but good. Overall, we were very impressed. The only other thing is I believe the price we were billed for some items were higher than on the menu. The shrimp cocktail & wine by the glass were billed at a dollar more. The wine pours could also be better. We will definitely be back, really enjoyed our dinner!"}
{"text":"Well is been over 30 years since I came here ... wow it was very good.  Clams in white wine butter sauce was sinfully good.  Crab cake was very flavorful with plenty of crab and nicely crisped.  The sauce with it was ridiculously good.  One pound of crab was generous and yes it was very fresh .. which is tough to find in Cleveland.  Service was excellent.  A great find for very good seafood in a town that has very little quality seafood.

Will be back and highly recommended!!!"}
{"text":"Atmosphere and service nice but not stellar. Good seafood but not great and few gluten free / non fried choices. Pricey for what you get."}
{"text":"I chose this restaurant because my girlfriend and I were looking for a place nearby with AYCE crab legs. Our only criteria for choosing Sussex was it's close proximity, our general disappointment with Pickle Bill's and the mostly positive Yelp reviews. 

The crab legs were probably the best I have ever had, the entire staff was friendly and helpful, especially our waitress Barb who is killin the waitress game. The banana cream pie and chocolate mousse pie are also delicious. I would highly recommended trying one of those desserts.  Overall a very good dining experience. I will definitely return to gorge myself on their delicious offerings."}
{"text":"My husband and I had visited Sussex quite a few times in the past but had not been there lately. I had a taste for seafood and thought I would stop in on a Friday evening. Unfortunately it was not as good as my previous visits, the staff is always super nice, but the food just didn't wow me as it had done in the past.  There was a note posted on the door that the restaurant would discontinue serving the all you can eat crab legs as of the beginning of September which I know is a big draw for customers but not my reason for this visit. The specials board advertised that day's special soup was clam chowder which is how I started my meal, I also ordered the shrimp platter which normally comes with coleslaw and steak fries, I substituted a tossed salad for the coleslaw for an additional $2.  The clam chowder arrived a short time later very disappointing, very thick almost paste like, not a lot of flavor and not very many clams.  There was a bit of a wait before my salad arrived it was nothing too get excited about. My entree  arrived a short while later, the shrimp were a nice size probably 16 to 20 count and there were at least six to eight on the plate but they were heavily battered and a little bit doughy.  After the first few I had to remove the batter and just eat the underlying shrimp. There was a small amount of fries, very small to accompany the shrimp. I was looking forward to dessert as I have done in the past but decided against it after my mediocre meal. I hope this was just a one-time instance but I'm not sure that I'll go back anytime soon"}
{"text":"I ordered the linguine with clam sauce to go. The sauce seeped into my bag and it was a bag full of liquid. The sauce was more like water instead of an actual sauce. No flavor. But there was a nice amount of clam meat. When I got home I reheated and seasoned everything and it was a little better. Wouldn't go back. The green beans were ice cold too. And nothing special but steamed unseasoned beans."}
{"text":"Best crab legs in town, or maybe all the surrounding areas.  They have best wait staff and the place is very, very clean. Great job guys keep up the great job.."}
{"text":"If you're ever craving good and authentic fish and chips, this is the place to go! I've ordered takeout from Sussex a few times now, knowing they were best known for their fish and chips. And let me tell you; the first time I tried it changed my view on how fish and chips should really be done. 

You can choose the style you want the fish done in. The batter fried version is perfect, not bread-like or thick. Think tempura, but better. And it stays on the fish wonderfully, doesn't fall off. The 8oz portion size of fish is huge! It also comes in 
12 and 16oz.

Fries are okay, the coleslaw is pretty good. I even ordered out a 1/2 pound of crab legs once and they were delicious! Easy to crack, not water logged,  and still hot when I got home. 

As a tip, I wouldn't recommend taking out if you're traveling too far because the steam from the fish softens the batter while inside the box. Then you wouldn't get to experience the delicious crispy-ness from the first bite."}
{"text":"This is a hidden gem. I have lived on the east side of Cleveland for many years and just found this restaurant on Yelp. We arrived on a Saturday at around 6:30 pm. The dining room was busy, but we were promptly greeted and seated. The waitress took our orders. We had the fried calamari and fried clams. The portions were generous and the food arrived piping hot and crispy, but not greasy. We also ordered the strip steak and lobster tail, pan seared scallops with a lobster tail, crab cakes, Cajun scallops. For sides we enjoyed cole slaw, green beans, salad, and, red skinned potatoes. The portions were generous. Desert consisted of banana cream pie and chocolate lava cake. All dishes were delicious and for a busy Saturday evening we did not have to wait long. This restaurant is an older building, but we were comfortable in jeans, as the atmosphere is casual. All members of our party enjoyed the meal, and we will return in the future to try more offerings!"}
{"text":"I went in for dinner today and the restaurant was decent. I thought the food was a bit more on the expensive side and portions were just enough. I got the Alaskan salmon special and it was good - nothing special. My side dish - baked beans had so much butter that it reminded me of Paula Deen! Service was friendly and fast. Nothing great but nothing really wrong either. I am really neutral about this place :)"}
{"text":"Best seafood in Cleveland!  A true hidden gem amongst fishy chains.  

My family and I have frequented Sussex for years and have never had a bad meal.  Family favorites are the Tempura battered shrimp, the grilled shrimp salad, and the original fish and chips.  

Food is always piping hot and delicious!!!"}
{"text":"Surprisingly good! Stopped by on a whim and had a great meal with delightful service. The clam chowder is awesome!"}
{"text":"Great Service, Great Atmosphere, and most importantly amazing all you can eat crab! Really enjoyed myself!"}
{"text":"It was okay i went here for dinner with my family since we heard everyone raving about the it. We werent that impressed its way over priced my dad wasnt a fan of his fish he saod there was too much breading on it. The coleslaw was a soupy mess it didnt look good to me and also felt like if you ate it you eould get the runs. My fish was okay ive had better, but it wasnt terrible. They charged us for a refill on my coke when they already over charge you for a fish dinner. The cheapest thing on our bill was my moms dinner my dinner and my dads dinner were both 20 bucks. So the bill was 60 bucks for the 3 of us when its casual dining experience. Youre better off going somewhere else"}
{"text":"Food was excellent. definitely try the calamari it was super yummy as were the mussels. The service was even better than the food, such sweet people. We will for sure be back again :)"}
{"text":"not a fan, the food was not good, way tooo expensive, decor was terrible.....i missed the point on this one :("}
{"text":"I liked it. Food came out fast, hot, and I thought it very reasonably priced.  Got the linguini Alfredo, and was  very happy with it. Very large portion."}
{"text":"At first look its like walking into a Twilight Zone episode.  The decor is dated the servers a bit odd but the food was amazing.

We were passing through on our way home from up near the lake and need to stop and eat.  Of course I stopped and checked Yelp for sea food in the area.  After reading the Yelp reviews and decided to try the Sussex.  It was definitely worth it.

David, my husband had the fried platter, Ashley my daughter had the steamed and I had the breaded Haddock.

It was a bit pricey but you also got good size portions and everything was cooked to perfection.

We will definately eat here again on our way to the lake or on our way home."}
{"text":"omg .. How this place went under my radar for so long is a mystery .. love seafood & this place did not disappoint .. clam chowder was excellent .. I had the steamed sampler & everything on it was top quality & simply delicious .. my husband raved about his dish as well (Dijon glazed salmon) .. the dessert was home made banana cream pie & if you are a fan I highly recommend you indulge if it is offered .. the crust was made with walnuts & it added a new twist to an old favorite .. will definitely be back .. kinda wished we were hungry enough to take part in the all you an eat crab legs but I already got that on my list for next time"}
{"text":"We came a long way for the all-you-can-eat crab legs and were certainly not disappointed.  The crab legs were huge and very, very good quality.  We also had calamari and it too was great.  The service was amazing, I have to say.  We actually had two folks helping us and they were both very sweet and made sure that we had everything that we wanted.  I noticed that they were also very accommodating to other table's wishes.  One lady ordered two pounds of crab legs and asked that they be brought out one cluster at a time so that they were always hot.  No problem.  

I really enjoyed this place.  It's very homey and I like looking around a dining room and seeing families enjoying a meal together.

If I could throw another half star on there I would, the only thing keeping them from five stars is the bathroom.  It's a little sketchy and the toilets are wobbly.  LOL"}
{"text":"Wow. This is the best sea food I have had in a long time. Coleslaw and the drunken muscles were delicious! Followed by their famous fried fish and 2lbs of Alaskan King Crab!
     Lets start with the muscles. The sauce is delicious. It's buttery and garlicky. The crab was delicious as well! Its served with a small cup of butter that is kept warm with a candle under it! The fried fish is possibly the best I have ever had! My boyfriend and I both got stuffed off of all this food. 
     But then...the home made banana cream pie...amazing! My boyfriend even said it was better than his grandmas! :O (shh don't tell her). 
      The only thing I would say was only so-so was the red skin potatoes. A little undercooked and lacked flavor but nothing some tarter sauce couldn't fix (which was amazing as well).  Overall I am very satisfied and will be back!!! :)"}
{"text":"We ate here few times. It's a fairly nice place to eat. Some of the menu items are a little pricey for the value but the food taste good. The best price for the value is all-you-can eat crab legs.They have a very good homemade potato chips as a side. The rolls are served nice and hot. The crab legs is really good. They don't over season it at all and you can taste more of the natural crab meat. All and all this is far better place than Pickle Bill. Lately the Pickle Bill food is not as good as it used to be. 

This is a place I can go on occasion. It's a good place to eat."}
{"text":"Went there for a Good Friday fish lunch. Had the fried perch with fresh made chips. The batter wasn't too heavy and crispy. One of the best fish and chips I have had. The portion size all around were good. My husbands green beans were not from a can and seemed fresh. I'd go back again."}
{"text":"I love the all you can eat crab legs, and Barb is the best! I make sure I only go on the nights she's working. She always makes sure your orders are in and the crabs come out steaming hot. If you're looking for all you can eat, go see Barb at Sussex!"}
{"text":"We had a reservation for Father's Day. Line out the door. Told them we where here for our reservation after waiting at desk for 15 min. Was told ok. 30 minutes later we still standing there. Place was understaffed and filthy. I was watching guy in kitchen cooking everything came out of the freezer. He was taking frozen crab with no gloves on putting in dirty steamer. Well enough for me to see by the way with reservation still waiting 45 min. We decided to leave will never return to this place and what staff that was there could care less."}
{"text":"For an unassuming little restaurant, the food is wonderful. Crab legs by the pound, expertly prepared. We spent more time comparing large slabs of crab meat we were pulling from the shells than anything else. The service was homey and friendly. The atmosphere is comfortable if not exactly quiet.  I wouldn't hesitate to recommend Sussex to anyone but maybe the stuffiest of diners. If you want buttoned up service and snooty flair, this is the wrong place. If you want friendly, fun, and delicious, this place is great."}
{"text":"I love the crab cakes here! They are Rhett best that I never had in a long time! I'll keep coming but just for them.  Also sign up for text alerts on discounts!"}
{"text":"Went there for lunch today for the first time and I was impressed.  I had my fish cajun steamed with garlic which was very good.  It comes with choice of two sides, my two the coleslaw and green beans were very good.  I would probably try the fried fish next time just because that it what they are well known for but I generally like to eat on the healthier side so more often then not would be perfectly content with the steamed cajun style with garlic.  The reason I had to give it four stars is not five is because it claims to be a seafood restaurant and while they have plenty of seafood, crab legs, shrimp, salmon and the scrod (That is the type of fish I had that you can also get fried or done 2 or three other ways) the only other choice of fish for an entree was salmon and I guess I would just expect the place to have a larger selection at least for my tastes in seafood.  I love variety, but it appears that while they don't have a huge variety they do everything that they have well so I'll give credit for that.  They don't open till 3 on most days, only on Friday do they open in time for lunch.  Likely for those who observe the no meat on Friday's during lent.  I would recommend it and certainly go back but in general I'd prefer Mitchell's or McCormick and Schmicks for their greater selection."}
