{"text":"Oh if only we had a cheese shop like this in DC! If you are visiting Montreal DO NOT miss this shop."}
{"text":"My favourite cheese shop in Montreal. The Marché Jean-Talon location has an amazing selection, though lineups can be long on weekends. The Atwater Market location has a slightly smaller selection but fewer lineups. I always get great service at both, and the salespeople are always happy to make a recommendation or to give me small samples to taste.   I have to watch my wallet carefully since it`s easy to spend a lot of money here. On the other hand, the wax paper that they use to wrap the cheese makes it last much longer than cheese purchased from the supermarket or even other cheese shops."}
{"text":"Que dire de cette fromagerie... ... ... ILS ONT DE TOUT!!! Que ce soit pour une raclette, un souper fromage/ vin ou tout simplement pour vous faire des sandwichs \"parisien\" ( 1/2 baguette, jambon, beurre, brie)... Je ne sais quoi dire que: fonce mon gars (ou mademoiselle)!!!  Pour finir, amateur de fromage ou non, le staff \"super cool\" vous aidera à trouver VOTRE perle rare \"fromager\"!!!"}
{"text":"I have entered cheesy heaven. This fromagerie was bustling with people when I went in at 3pm. We were buying cheese for a picnic but we had no idea what was good or what when with what. Thankfully, the girl at the cheese counter was super nice and helpful. We told her what we were having for the picnic and she recommended cheeses accordingly. We sampled 4 different kinds of cheeses and ended up getting 2 amazing ones.   Albeit expensive, the place was far from bougie. But coming here has definitely made me more of a cheese snob."}
{"text":"This is as good as cheese gets in Montreal. Cheaper than Val-Mont next door, which competes for fancy cheeses."}
{"text":"Bought some imported Buratta cheese and parmesan and could not be more pleased with the quality. The service is also great and really attentive."}
{"text":"Super fromage et excellant service."}
{"text":"Super fromage et super sourire de tout les employer. Demander Lindsay pour un service hors pair"}
{"text":"The service we received was nothing short of excellent.  I tried a few Quebec cheeses and ended up with three excellent choices.  The store stocks all the necessary supplies to put together a nice cheese course.  The sourdough baguette was also really well done."}
{"text":"Standard pour une haute qualité choix,service,tradition.jamais déçu.cher et très,très bon!longue vie!"}
{"text":"I actually cried when I walked in here for the first time. There might be a better selection of cheese somewhere in the world. But I doubt it.   No prices anywhere. So don't be shy and ask the staff for things they see as good values. Otherwise, dropping $100 here is easier than at Whole Foods in Palo Alto.  Hint: Époisses de Bourgogne paired with a decent Bordeaux (or...gasp...California cabernet) and a baguette from Guillaume is a more potent aphrodisiac than oysters.    Rating Scale: 1 Star: Avoid the town in which this place is located just to be safe.   2 Star: With so many great places to choose from, why risk this one? 3 Star: I'll try it again or consume here in a pinch. 4 Star: I go here regularly if financially and/or calorically feasible. 5 Star: I look forward to taking my wife or friends here."}
{"text":"Very upset!!! Left the store less than an hour ago ready to try the burratta we just bought ( which clearly indicated on the package that it was packaged yesterday) only to get home and realize the cheese had turned. Very disappointed considering Fromagerie Hamel specializes in cheese- this should not have happened!"}
{"text":"i had never before heard of or seen a pressed block of cheese curds, but believe me, it is the stuff dreams are made of."}
{"text":"Fromageries are about the only place you can get good cheese in Montreal.  All the grocery stores have really shitty selections.  For all the fromageries I've been to, La Fromagerie Hamel is absolutely my favorite in Montreal.  They have a grand selection and good prices.  There are a couple other fromageries around this one in particular, but they are not as large or well staffed as Fromagerie Hamel, so don't waste your time.  I struggled on the rating between 4 and 5 stars because there is a cheese from France I really like, which oddly they have no idea what I'm talking about (brebirousse d'argental).  However, I can go to Ottawa, an English speaking area I might add, and get exactly this cheese.  On the other hand, they had variations of soft ripened sheep's cheese similar, so I can at least get that.  At the end of the day there is no better option in Montreal, so I'm sticking with a 5 star rating.  Nevertheless, this is the best fromagerie I've been to and by far my favorite fromagerie in Montreal."}
{"text":"Que dire de plus qui n'a pas déjà été dit... A part l'mmense choix de fromage, de pâtés et de charcuterie... Et bien, il y a le service. Toujours professionnel et avenant. Malgré les longues files, il me semble que le temps passe toujours trop vite quand je vais chez Hamel. Les conseillers prennent le temps de faire le travail, vous font goûter les fromages, vous en présente de nouveaux quand vous êtes indécis.  On aime tellement aller chez Hamel, que l'on fait parfoit des soupers Charcuteries-fromages juste pour en essayer de nouveaux et aller dans la boutique.  Les prix sont tout à fait correcte et pour les amateurs de raclette, il y a aussi un grand choix pour ces fromages.  Bon appétit!"}
{"text":"Super friendly staff, and lots of cheese. That's pretty much the ideal situation for a cheese shop.   I would highly recommend this shop, especially since they have sales where the delicious cheeses are even cheaper! As an English speaker, they weren't rude to me and offered lots of help and in the end we walked out with 12 different cheeses."}
{"text":"La Fromagerie Hamel is located at the Marché Jean-Talon.  Anyone who knows me knows that I simply cannot live without cheese.  My parents on the other hand are not so understanding when the aromas of a sharp blue cheese encases the house, and my dad starts opening up windows as if a fire erupted and we're all gasping for air.  I kid you not.  My parents are definitely Asian.  If my dad thinks one slab of blue cheese baking in the oven is unbearable, I'd hate to see his reaction upon entering La Fromagerie Hamel.  He'd probably turn as blue as my Roquefort.  To a non-cheese-lover, the aroma probably would be about as pleasant as walking by a garbage site - but to a cheese-lover such as myself, it was like getting a whiff of Chanel from the atomizer.    I iterate that I am a cheese lover, but not particularly a cheese connoisseur.  I was absolutely overwhelmed by the vast array of cheese that were available!  From the very familiar cheddar and mozzarella, to \"what the heck is that?\" types of cheese.  I didn't know where to start!  All the customers in the stores seemed like gurus and knew exactly what to order, while I shyly circled the counter several times out of sheer intimidation.  Luckily, there were a few cheeses that were available on the counter for tasting, and I decided to go with a Beaufort that I tried.  I just can't go home to Toronto without buying a slab of cheese - it'd be like going to Paris and not coming home with a box of macarons!  The Beaufort was not a mild cheese, but it wasn't an extremely sharp cheese either.  It was somewhere in the middle, had a pronounced dairy taste to it, and was a harder cheese.  Not the type you could slap on a sandwich and melt, but more of a munching cheese.    When you are ready to order, you simply take a number, and one of the many boys/girls behind the counter will call out your number.    Other than cheese, you will find a vast array of tapenades, spreads and oils available for purchase.  I will definitely be back to Fromagerie Hamel on future Montréal trips..."}
{"text":"Comment dire que j'aime le fromage? genre beaucoup ... à la folie.  Que de joie quand j'ai découvert cette fromagerie pendant une promenade dans le marché Jean Talon. Je rentre et on sent cette odeur spécifique de toutes bonnes fromageries.  Le choix ... immense, j'ai retrouvé du fromage français que j'aimais mangé quand je vivais la bas, mais j'ai surtout découvert le bon fromage d'ici par exemple un bon cheddar fumé vieilli 2 ans ... et j'en passe.  Le service est génial malgré tout les clients qu'il peut y avoir, les conseillers vont prendre le temps de vous faire goûter les fromages qui vous intéressés ou vont vous diriger vers tel ou tel fromage selon ce que vous rechercher.  Puis surtout les prix très attractifs, on peux se faire un bon plateau de fromage pour moins de 30$. Les fromages ne sont vraiment pas cher.  Chose que j'ai aussi trouvé super : les plateaux dégustation/découverte que vous pouvez acheter ou alors les cartes cadeaux (minimum 20$) que j'ai offert à des amis qui aiment aussi beaucoup le fromage.  J'ai vu qu'ils avaient aussi de la charcuterie et d'autres produits mais j'avoue ne pas m'y être vraiment intéressé pour le moment.  Un vrai régal à chaque fois que j'y vais."}
{"text":"Plus petite que la grande sur du marché Jean Talon, mais on reconnais bien une fromagerie Hamel.  Je l'ai découvert récemment grâce à Yelp et j'en suis ravi, car habitant proche de Frontenac ça reste ben plus proche que Jean Talon  Le choix du fromage est un peu moins conséquent qu'a l'autre place, mais il y en a tout de même beaucoup.   Sur le fond il y a de la charcuterie qui avait l'air appétissante. Et il y avait aussi une étagère avec plein de produit du terroir.  Mais je voulais vraiment mettre l'accent sur le service, qui a été super. Je recevais des amis le soir et je voulais faire un plateau de fromage, j'ai goûté différent fromage et eu une très bonne variété. (tout le monde a aimé).   Donc très bonne fromagerie, mais faite attention a ne pas la louper car je suis souvent passé devant sans la voir."}
{"text":"Best place to stop at Jean-Talon?  Maybe.  Great place to load up on goodies for a Montreal weekend."}
{"text":"Franchement époustouflée !  Le prix et la qualité des fromages rien à redire !! Pour un petit morceau de Tome de Savoie, un demi Chabichou et du conté d'affinage jeune tous de France: 15$ Le choix est incroyable des classiques québécois comme l'Oka, aux incontournables français (on va pas les citer il y en a beaucoup trop) mais aussi des italiens, des espagnols incroyables ! Il y a également quelques pièces de charcut dont du jambon de Bayonne (oui oui du vrai). Bref Hamel, un régale !!!!"}
{"text":"So.  Much.  Cheese.    Perhaps one of the best selections I've ever seen.  But that's not what makes this place great.  The staff is enchating.  They actually know their product well.    I went in knowing exactly what I wanted.  One sharp cheddar, preferably made in Montreal.   One bleu cheese, also hopefully local.  Creamy, sharp and sweet.  The closest Montreal cheese for bleu was very good but he suggested I also try a French cheese which was amazing as well in different ways.  I bought both.  3 hunks of very nice cheeses were under $20.   Joy for all.  Also, if you want to make your own poutine, this is the place to get the curds.  Not in Montreal?  Pas de probleme.  They are online too."}
{"text":"This is probably my favorite cheese stop in Montreal. Amazing variety! Best way to discover new cheese and learn a little bit of its maker at the same time! You have to stop and try!"}
{"text":"Wow, I was surprised at the variety of cheese!  A lot are varieties I have not seen elsewhere. They even have a room that is temperature controlled to help ripen the cheese!  Once you walk in, you can SMELL the lovely, pungent scent of cheese, and it makes my mouth water.  Love!!!"}
{"text":"My wife and I were visiting from the D.C. area and stopped by La Fromagerie Hamel in search of some smoked salmon. Now we did not end up with any salmon, but one of the deli counter folks named Didier totally wowed us with his knowledge of cheese and pretty much all things gourmet. Thank you for introducing us to smoked French cheese Didier!"}
{"text":"Highly recommend for excellent selection and quality. We spent $50 here recently on cheese, baguette and pate that lasted us (two people) for two meals! Highly recommend the pate faisan -pistache and the rillette canard rougie! Also love their reusable tote bags that prominently feature cheese!"}
{"text":"Fromagerie Hamel probably has one of  -  if not the largest - selection of cheeses in Montreal. Its staff is very knowledgeable and offers great service (after braving the potential wait); they're great at suggesting new varieties to try and specific cheeses to go with particular meals, wines, beers, or any other liquor for that matter, and that, whatever your price range. I also really enjoy the variety of other products in store, such as jams, tapenades, pâtés, canned items, etc. They have saved me many times when in a crunch before a dinner party!   Note that if you go on the weekend, you may have to wait a while before being served. So just grab a number and peruse the other products available ;)"}
{"text":"You know that you are in a good cheese shop when you walk in and the scent of a million dirty socks strikes your nose!  This cheese shop located near the Marche Jean-Talon has a huge selection of cheeses ranging from fresh cheese to aged varieties. The cost here is fairly reasonable and before you leave you need to stock up on some of their fresh breads.   The only critique is that the service here is phenomenal, but the store is so busy that the staff tends to rush you along. That being said, if you love cheese, then this is your shop!"}
{"text":"We were served by a knowledgeable 'frommagisto' who made recommendations and let us try local cheeses and salamis. He also recommended a smoked duck breast we would not have realized to try. Finally he recommended some beer pairings by Quebec breweries.   We just had an amazing dinner with cheese, salamis, and beer. We owe it to the frommagisto at Hamel!"}
{"text":"Il y a une bonne sélection de produits variés de qualités . C'est pas   Loin du métro Jean - Talon   ."}
{"text":"Hello cheese heaven. I love you. In addition to all the cheese, which I can't speak of because I might weep, there are local saucisson sec and fresh breads and pastries and inexpensive olives. And oh god. The cheese!"}
{"text":"Our American tourist family shopped here three times in three days for delicious meats and cheeses for dinner and snacks.  With each visit, attentive employees helped us with recommendations and samples and were ever so patient with our sad American English and utter lack of cheese expertise.  In addition to cheese, they have all kinds of meats, breads, and dairy goods, plus it's right next to Jean-Talon where you can find everything else you might want.  I'd go weekly or more if I lived in Montreal."}
{"text":"Fromagerie Hamel is a serious institution in cheese that has been serving Montreal's cheese loving population for over 60 years!  What you have here is a strong selection of any kind of cheese to serve your liking!  Also a fine selection of cured sausages, oils, jams, cookies, chocolate and most of the finer and rich things you need to find to compliment a meal or snack.  What I have found here however is the cafe caps \"re-useable\" caps for a Nespresso machine.  Location is right adjacent to Marche-Jean Talon.  A great place to come for your cheese or fine food fixing!"}
{"text":"If a fire broke out at Fromagerie Hamel, I'd be there first one there with bread and butter, ready to make the best damn grilled cheese anyone's seen.  The prices were what I expected for a specialty grocery store.  Since we were traveling, splurging on multiple bricks of cheese was out of the question.  I was limited to my personal consumption only.    To go with a baguette I had purchased earlier, I bought a small log of Quebec-made goat cheese for $6.  This is a little bit more than I'd spend at the local grocery store, but it's about the same as what I would pay at any specialty grocer.  The goat cheese was fresh, creamy, and a good value.  One could go wild in here if fixing up a charcuterie plate.  Don't like the prepackaged options?  There's an even bigger variety behind the glass deli cases.  J'adore Montreal.  J'adore fromage."}
{"text":"Maybe a little pricey, but damn, do they have a lot of cheese. On the weekends it seems like they do some great sampling of cheeses that are on sale. This was great for us because we found two that we'd never had and they were delicious! Very friendly staff as well."}
{"text":"Situé au Marché Jean Talon, vous trouverez ici une grande variété de fromages locaux et importés. Plusieurs nouveautés et arrivages."}
{"text":"I love going to Fromagerie Hamel because i can always count on their fresh Ste-Guillaume cheddar curds.  Don't get me wrong, they have an amazing selection of other cheeses, but sometimes you just want a place you can really rely on for the simple things.  In the past, they had wheels of it, yellow or white (same cheese, the yellow is just coloured with beta-carotene), so you could have them cut a large wedge for you.  Now they also have small bags of individual curds, if you prefer that.  Hamel is also my go-to store for Burrata, mozzarella balls with LIQUID CREAM INSIDE!!!!  Like some other reviewers have mentioned, they do tend to rush customers, which I find to be pushy.  This can detract from the cheese shop experience if you're trying to explore and sample new items.  Overall, Hamel has a great selection, and the store has a comfortable amount of room to move around, coupled with the prime location right next to the Jean-Talon market, this should definitely be on your list of quality cheese shops in Montreal."}
{"text":"After hearing so much about la Fromagerie Hamel, I decided to give it a go, to find myself completely at a loss. I'm not a fromage connoisseur so I was simply overwhelmed by the humongous display. I was pleasantly surprised to find some fine condiments and delicacies (sugar violets, jellied hibiscus) and great, reasonably-priced jam! Seeing the selection and the quality of the products, I wouldn't say they are \"expensive\" but adequately priced, great news when you realized how overpriced cheese can be in a regular supermarket!  Since I was way too shy to really approach the counter (and eventually engage in cheesy-conversation, *gasp*!), I decided to find something on the shelves. A big red block called out to me: \"Ski Queen\". LOL! An inspection of the label reads \"Oslo, Norway\". Ski Queen, we belong together! The staff present during the week seems a bit blasé but they get super efficient during the week-end rush!"}
{"text":"I went there for a quick lunch. Disappointed to see only 2 kinds of sandwich, but I'm guessing that's not their main priority. Not only that, but the sandwich was rock hard even though it's made the same day. The cheese and the turkey was pretty good though, even though for a 5$ sandwich there weren't that much ingredients.  Next time I'll go for the good cheese, but for now, it's a 3-star.  EDIT: well I went back for the cheese and salami. Very professional help and cater to my needs. They even let you sample b4 buying!"}
{"text":"Excellente et impressionnante sélection de produits québécois et étrangers ! Ici, j'ai enfin trouvé des fromages que je n'arrivais pas à trouver nul part ailleurs, même dans les épiceries spécialisées. Si vous hésitez, les serveurs se feront un plaisir de vous faire goûter. Ils connaissent vraiment leur boulot, vous pouvez vous fier à leur jugement. Cet endroit mérite le détour. Je recommande vraiment."}
{"text":"I felt like I was cheating on America's Dairyland. No Wisconsin cheese but hundreds,  HUNDREDS you guys from around the world! And even though I'm lactose free I could appreciate the spectacular array of options and add-ons, quick things to grab for a lovely picnic or some charcute."}
{"text":"the best  cheese selection hands down in montreal. they  have cheeses you just can't find anywhere else in the area...like their nuage de bourgogne... a beautiful light and creamy soft cheese with a relatively mild rind...like a fluffy cloud of  slightly tangy silky goodness. first place i tried bellavitano at the recommendation of one of the  conseillers and it's almost like cheese candy. they have a great merlot and expresso one too. be sure to ask about their homemade canberge et bleuet cheese spread just a little denser and tangier than cream cheese. delicious!! sometimes i'll just tell him what i'm in the mood for and get some suggestions. I've never been dissapointed.  also not to miss is their sellection of terrines made with unexpected combinations of fruit and unusual meats/poultry/game/etc  there is usually at least a few specials of the week. lets you try out a new cheese or meat product. love it!!!"}
{"text":"One of the best cheese stores anywhere, very formal in their training of how to handle and select cheeses.  The sheer number of cheeses available can make anyone feel overwhelmed, so what I suggest  to those going for the first time is to visit during the off days. By going on a week day, you will have an opportunity to take your time ask questions and even sample some of the cheeses before you buy.  Don't be intimidated to ask, questions and set the prices your would like to pay.  The staff there is very professional, and this can seem snobbish, or intimidating in it's formality, but as a long time, extremely frequent client of theirs I can assure you they are really only looking to help.  So take your time getting to know them and the gazillion cheeses they offer and you will be happy.  Ironically one of my repeat purchases is a simple fresh cheddar, made locally called the St Guillaume, I usually have a piece served first, then I nibble on it while selecting other cheeses.  Go try and have fun"}
