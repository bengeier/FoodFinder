{"text":"Good as the original Zets, but the staff are generally pissed off and grumpy. I wouldnt go here often, just in a pinch for dinner and I'm too lazy too cook. I'd compare it to Jumbo Burger or Apache burger, just an ordinary burger joint."}
{"text":"Wow, what a feast. Low key, trucker stop type place and they sure don't skimp on ingredients. My husband and I both had the Zet burger - double party, bacon - and ordered poutine on the side. The burgers were massive and needless to say, the side order of poutine was not necessary. The patty was tasty and my only issue was that the bun was very crumbly, which was not really a big deal. Also very friendly staff. Definitely recommend if you're in the area."}
{"text":"Great burgers, souvlaki on a pita with a full pound of chicken. Home made tzatziki. Huge servings!!! Crispy fish & chips. Friendly staff. Patio and soon to be licensed. Who could ask for more?"}
{"text":"Came here for the first time with a friend and we both really liked the place. Place was small but clean and inviting. Nice comfortable booths (important to me). Not busy when we went so we didn't have to wait in a line up like I've seen on one of the pictures on Zets business page on yelp. I got the souvlaki on a bun. Very tasty, very good, very huge!! OMG did I mention huge! I couldn't finish it all. Well worth the money. Fries were just ok. Would definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Wow breakfast! I have been here many times before. That is for great lunch items! And the quantity is more then fare! But now they have breakfast. 2 eggs,  sausages, home fries and toast $7 and a bottomless coffee. They knock it out of the park! Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"This is the mini version of Zed's 24 hr restaurant on airport road.  The funny thing is the decor and atmosphere is better cos it has comfy booths and windows on three sides with a view of the airport. The food is the usual pub fare / Greek stuff. Souvlaki, burgers , etc."}
{"text":"If you want meat sweats go to Zets. that should be their tagline. 
Came here with my cousin who is a flight attendant. We only had a few hours before he was to start working again.

We ordered the chick souvlaki and a huge burger. The place was packed. It was juicy and well seasoned. The onion rings are addictive. 

I think I had a minor heart attack after eating here. But it is SO GOOD. I dare you to finish your food here - impossible, given the huge proportions!"}
{"text":"Wow, Zet's Express is lovely! Great decor, fast service and broad menu.

I had the pulled pork sandwich, it was served extremely hot, so if you order the same, give it some time to cool. 

As a compliment to this healthy choice, I also ordered the small poutine. It was massive! 

Very friendly service. By the way, if you're a plane spotter, Zet's Express is close to YYZ's north/south runway."}
{"text":"Due to my epic failure to attend any of the awesome Burger Brigade events because of my aversion to driving in snow, I felt an obligation to have a huge burger.  

On that count, it was a success as I had a 10 oz burger which consisted of two 5 oz patties, bacon and cheese in between a crispy bun.  While the beef was fresh and handmade and the bacon was cooked perfectly, I didn't find the burger super amazing.  Maybe it's because I'm spoiled or maybe it's because I'm starting to dislike meat more these days (oh gawd, what has become of me???!!!) or possibly be more selective, but I dunno. Something seemed off.  

Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed it, I just didn't think it was awesome.  What I do like about this place is that it's clean, staff is nice, prices are reasonable and everything seems to be made fresh and it's open 24 hours.  

Verdict: Decent food at any time and much better than McD's, and good 24/7 options.  

Tip - cash only."}
{"text":"Had the Pork Souvlaki.  Extremely dry meat, would never ever order again.  Doesn't come with typical Greek style roasted potatoes as the other Zets does up the road.   The tzatziki sauce was also super heavy on the garlic side.  Only fries and salad are options.  

Honestly, I've been to the other Zets many times and don't see a reason to come to this location.  The non express one (less than 5 minutes away) has way more offerings and MUCH better quality, and pretty fast service, so not sure if i'd ever need to come to this location.

This restaurants having an identity crisis from a typical burger joint vs a greek style diner."}
{"text":"i got the zet special burger $8, make it a combo $14 bucks all said and done.
a little pricey, yes, but i got a massive burger. i am a big guy, and i tried so hard and the burger would not fit into my mouth for a proper bite. that is how big it is.
fries were average at best.
drink is the same size as a small drink at any major fast food place.
the souvlaki's in the back burners looked insane in terms of size.

even though its an \"express\" - still took them about 10 mins to make my food - which i dont care about at all, but just a misnomer in the name.

amazing burger - pick your own toppings, perfect quality cheddar cheese on the burger. all in all a great joint."}
{"text":"Amazing chicken souvlaki! It's a pretty big portion so make sure you're hungry. The service is okay, everyone is pretty grumpy, but I don't go there for the service, I go for the great food. 
Can't go wrong with the fries either, poutine and chili cheese fries are great!"}
{"text":"I'm not sure I completely understand why this location exists when Zet's... THE Zet's... is just 5 minutes around the corner. Zet's Express offers a somewhat scaled back menu and is presumably a way to share the experience of food perfection that is Zet's with those on the north side of the airport without having to make the turn down Airport Rd. during times of traffic. But that's a guess.

Anyway, you simply can't go wrong with Zet's. Their food is simply unbelievable even if this location doesn't make sense to the casual observer. :)"}
{"text":"Always friendly staff. Great atmosphere. I like to go here for lunch. Totally recommend"}
{"text":"Stopped by here on a trip to Toronto and the house burger lived up to the reviews.  As a previous review said, the two patties were cooked perfectly AS WELL as the bacon (does it seem to you like bacon burgers almost always come with undercooked bacon?)  Both the burger and the order of fries were huge, the place was clean and the staff was very friendly.  Thanks folks!"}
{"text":"I stop by this place now and then when I'm in the area. I have never been a big fan of owner operator restaurants. Be very arrogant attitude displayed by the lady at the cashier clearly indicates she's an owner and treats her customers the way she treats her employees. In my last visit I asked for a 5 ounce burger. I am very particular about the way my burgers are assembled. She asked me what I wanted on the burger after I told her she proceeded to just slap everything together. I said no no no excuse me would you please put the Mayonnaise then the lettuce then the burger then the pickles and tomatoes on top. She gave me a look as if I was really annoying and asked what's the damn difference. Then one of the cooks from the grill was also probably related yells out in a very demeaning way what's the difference it all goes down the same. It's not like I'm asking them to straighten out the Tower of Pisa. The lady then proceeded to tell me I am lucky that she's not busy or I wouldn't be getting my burger. I just left I didn't care about the money but I don't care to eat in a place that doesn't care about the customers experience. The only reason I gave this 2 Stars is because the food is not that bad but the pricing is a little bit too high."}
{"text":"Just down the road from their original location, Zet's has opened a second express location. I happened to be driving by and popped in for lunch. When I asked at the counter when they opened, they said yesterday! Good timing on my part. 

Everything is brand new from the ground up. The new location is obviously much nicer than the original. They put a lot of thought into this place. The decor is modern, the finishings are crisp, there's fresh flowers on the counter, and the overall feeling is classier than your average grab-and-dash burger joint.

Zet's obviously has a strong following. For being the second day of business the line was around the entire restaurant by 12:15. They call this an express location because there is a limited menu. Basically anything from their original menu that comes on a bun can be found here. There's a large number of sides which include fries, rings, poutine, chili cheese fries, coleslaw, etc.

The staff were great. The woman working the till was cheerful and was very particular in making sure she was entering my order right and calling it out. The gentleman making my burger was quick with getting the toppings I wanted and handed my burger over with a smile.

Burgers at Zet's are top notch. The patties are fresh, not frozen. Everything is made to order. Sure, it may take a little longer than your typical fast food restaurant, but it's worth the wait.

If it's your first time, get the Zet's burger."}
{"text":"The most I can give THIS Zets is a 3-Star. Unlike its big brother on Airport RD the service was slow...really slow considering they had 6 ppl working there at this lunch time. 

The food was mediocre at best. I ordered what I order @ the big brother Zets...the stuffed Chicken Pita. The Airport Zets Tzatziki is delicious, creamy  & garlicky...this Zets was just blah. Little flavour or zing! 

The pita itself should have been placed on the grill for warming...it wasn't. So it was a cold pita with cold veggies & warm chicken. 

You have much to learn from big brother Zets, grasshopper! Take the advice from them if offered."}
{"text":"ONE OF THESE MOST AMAZING FOOD PLACES I HAVE EVER BIN AND WILL ALWAYS BE NUMBER ONE IN MY BOOKS, this place has amazing food amazing people and amazing prices. Every date I try and make it at this place it's not one of the fanciest places (it is a truck stop) but it is worth every single bit of it even the 45 minute drive for myself."}
{"text":"one of the Best souvlaki's I have ever had.. wow.. massive...LOL... Actually it was TOO big.. as I ate it all and thought I was going to die later.

Definately a good spot and a short drive from the international center if you are looking for a something tasty and cheap"}
{"text":"My bf introduced me to this yummy place, he is obsessed with their burgers and fries for a delicious late night snack.

Definitely returning!!!"}
{"text":"It's been a long time since I've been to a greek diner.  Just stumbled upon Zet's and was very happily surprised.  This place reminds me of the greek diners I went to as a kid, complete with thick tzatziki, and portions that I could never finish.  Except now I'm and adult, and there's still no way I can finish the portions here.

While I've had somewhat juicier souvlaki elsewhere, the pork here was very flavorful, with a good grilled crust, but the meat inside was still tender enough to slice through effortlessly.  Definitely worth the price."}
{"text":"Easy and fast service. Good portions on burgers, poutines and chilli cheese fries. Delicious off the grill."}
{"text":"Zets is the place to go for souvlaki dinners and other foods that you might have cravings for.  Good portions for the price.  Try them if you haven't yet."}
{"text":"A Champs place. Good portions, fresh food, tastes good, right price. Word of caution, not the place for a first date. I mean you know you had a good meal when you feel like a champ after, and this means letting a few good ones go which is expected and completely natural. I'm married and the natural bodily functions is of no concern for both of us. We both eat like champs, we roll down the windows a bit afterward for a little fresh air, and when we get back home, we make love like champs. Forget about the fancy restaurants that give you more empty plate space than what's on it. I want my plate to be full, for a good price - because I'm a Champ.

Zet's, Eat like a Champ, Perform like a Champ, Loved like a Champ !"}
