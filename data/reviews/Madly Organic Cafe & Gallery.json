{"text":"Maybe it's a good thing I don't live close by to Madly Organic, otherwise I think I'd be there everyday. It's a simple menu, a few salads, soups, breakfast , desserts , wraps and drinks. I chose the Power Protein salad with chicken. The salad was a green lettuce base, with spicy beans & corn, red peppers, tomato, cheese and tortilla bits. The salad dressing was slightly spicy with cilantro and served on the side. It was delicious. I ordered the large and was so full. But not full enough to pass by the sample of sweet potato/ peanut soup. That was also delicious, it had some chili in it to give it a bit of a kick. Then I decided to order a macaroon, because I assumed it was small as it cost only 75cents. Turns out it was actually a decent size. It was oaty, coconutty perfection and not too sweet.  Then before leaving, and yes, 4 months pregnant with a food baby by this time, I left with a smoothie, the \"kid\" size. This is in fact the perfect size of smoothie, a size I wish more places carry (approximately a medium Tim Horton's coffee cup) The lady serving me was very nice and told me about the ingredients they use in their food. I can't wait to go back to give the other items a try. Don't pass this place up! It has food for vegans, gluten free diets and regular meat eaters alike."}
{"text":"Yay yay yay!!!!  Gluten free, Vegetarian, organic foods!!!  There are soup specials daily and almost always a gluten free and vegan option.  These specials are posted daily on their facebook page.  They also have fresh smoothies and juices which, they are happy to customize to your liking.  I am so stoked to have another delicious quality restaurant."}
