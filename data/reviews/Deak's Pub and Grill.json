{"text":"***Update*** Original review below in quotes, update to follow that.  \"Great family friendly pub with a wonderful staff and good food.  There are also plenty of TV's for catching a game.   I absolutely love the place.    They would get 5 stars if they had a better burger but everything else is pretty solid.\"  Deak's now has fresh chuck!  Their burgers are 100% improved.  The kitchen is getting used to the new meat but they will get it down soon.  I had one of their new burgers last Saturday and even though my medium-rare request came out medium-well, the burger was juicy and tasted fantastic.    Thanks Deak's!"}
{"text":"I've had lunch here several times and usually order a salad and have not been disappointed.  Colleagues have ordered burgers and sandwiches and have always been pleased.  The down side is, unless you have an unusually long lunch hour you do not have time to eat lunch here.  It takes a long time to place an order, a long time to get food, and a long time to get the check and make payment.   Today I placed a phone order thinking that would save some time.  I was first put on hold for nearly 5 minutes before being able to place the order.  When someone was finally able to take my order they were impolite and had great difficulty getting a simple order correct.  If you are in Stoughton and have plenty of time try it out, if time is of the essence take a pass.  Update:  This restaurant is under new management since the original review.  I have been there a few times since the switch and they have really picked up the pace in service and have also refined the menu.  The food has been great and the service has been speedy."}
{"text":"Like the food. Good beer selection for a small town. The fish fry is worth the trip. Hand made cheese curds and poppers. The waitress was great but the bartender was not friendly. Guessing because it wasn't her costumer so she didn't care? Though she had enough time for her phone."}
{"text":"Our first visit to Deak's in Stoughton, WI, on a February early Friday afternoon was a very nice surprise. The place looks very clean, as were the restrooms. A long bar with high wooden tables around the perimeter for meals features a quite extensive menu with reasonably priced salads, wraps, sandwiches, burgers & meals (a step above the usual pub food), plus they've got a good selection of micro/specialty brews on tap (about a dozen). We both ordered the pulled pork sandwich which they slow cook over night; it was  1/2 pound of finely shredded, extremely tender, not dry pork with not a bit of fat anywhere in it (hats off to the chef for the excellent trimming) that comes with a choice of 4 different sauces, on a nice Kaiser-type roll. My wife got a good-sized side of tasty, creamy coleslaw that came with the sandwich (1 of 3 choices); instead of the chips as my side, for $1 extra, I opted for the (endless) fries which they cut & make here - a generous portion which were actually make perfectly per my request: browned & crispier than normal. Our young server, Kyra, was exceptional, knowledgeable about questions we had, and checked back with us often to make sure everything was going well. We will definitely be back there when we are in the area."}
{"text":"Tucked away behind Culver's off Hwy 51, this little building is home of the best Greek chicken salad I've ever had.  I kid you not.  Paying just homage to \"bar and grill\", it gets both parts right every time.  Their Friday fish fry is a huge draw, and now that it's smoke-free (not to start something, just sayin), we'll be heading down there much more often to get our drink on."}
{"text":"I made this account specifically for this review.  I have come here a few times before and it seemed ok for a beer. As far as the food, who cuts brisket into CUBES!?  Their brisket sandwich seemed like a can of dogfood dumped onto a bun!  An insult to BBQ(granted, an establishment without a smoker can never serve good BBQ but still...). I was there just today and all I heard was catty complaining from the girls off duty across from me about how bad their new-hires were(within earshot of said new-hires).  As someone that operates a food/drink establishment, that kind of behavior is just not acceptable on any level. The atmosphere was completely ruined by the very unfriendly tone among the staff. If you have issues with your coworkers, don't shout it in front of the entire customer base...time to grow up."}
{"text":"Love this place for happy hour...especially in the summer so we can use the patio. Good drinks and good food. I also like their vegetarian options."}
{"text":"Enjoyed a buy-one-get-one from by lovable Mad City Cocktails book while touring Stoughton one weekend morning. Deak's menu is nearly identical (the same?) as Headquarters in Oregon. They must be affiliated. Hungover, we went for the bloody marys. Unfortunately, Deak's bloodies didn't come with the long meat stick like at Headquarters, however it was better mixed (i.e. A more balanced blend of tomato, booze, citrus, Worcestershire, horseradish - though I'm sure from a mix). We decided to have some late morning chicken strips and waffle fries. The portion was enough for both my partner and I, though we're good at sharing...food. Buffalo and ranch on the side. Bartender was nice, attentive enough. Televisions galore; this would be a good spot to come when the game isn't on your channels."}
{"text":"If you are not concerned with atmosphere, this is the place.  THey have everything else covered.  Great food, friendly service and a pretty good drink selection!  Check it out!!!"}

{"text":"We just went to Deak's for dinner tonight.  The staff was super friendly and the service was good, but the food really wasn't that great.  I doubt we will eat there again, the food was mediocre at best. There are lots of people who visit Deak's so others must really love it....we will leave the place to them.  :)"}
{"text":"Excellent menu, great quality food and prepared to perfection. My favorite burger joint."}
{"text":"Stopped for lunch recently and ordered the stuffed grilled cheese. Hardly stuffed...it came with a  Kraft Single (one slice) which isn't real cheese, tiny bits of bacon and thinly sliced tomato. The Parmesan garlic chips were mediocre...couldn't taste the garlic and the Parmesan was just sprinkled on top. Service was decent. Won't go back."}
{"text":"I've been here many times over the last three years. I love that this place offers vegetarian options. Food is really good for bar food. They also have a nice selection of craft beers. The staff is always friendly and even when they are busy they do a great job. The only drawback would be Friday nights. Unfortunately, every time I went for dinner on Fridays, the food would be burnt. It didn't matter what was ordered so I stopped going for food on Fridays but I would definitely recommend checking it out any other day."}
{"text":"We recently moved to Stoughton. We've tried Deaks out twice. I've been very happy both times. My kids got the cheese pizza's off the kids menus. They had plenty left over so that was awesome for lunch the next day. My husband and I both tried the french dip sandwich, soooo yummy!! I wanted to get it the second time I went but decided to branch out and had a steak sandwich instead, not as amazing, but still tasted good. Tuesdays kids eat free with an adult meal purchase, so that's pretty nice. I always like to save money when i can. We'll definitely be going back in the future."}
{"text":"Interesting lunch this PM, sat at bar and waitress took our order, pretty much never saw her again except she had to be tracked down for us to get our check. Ordered meal and it took a far amount of time considering they weren't busy. Got our food, nothing special and then proceeded to watch a couple of waitresses just hanging out in an area that is marked no loitering unless you are there to get food from the kitchen. One waitress is busy working and 2 others just bullshitting ignoring all the customers."}
{"text":"Sorry Deak's but this one is not a star for the playbook. We were in for the Badger game (vs OSU 10/2016) and we were really let down.   Not Deak's fault: bar was loud. It's game day. I get that. The crowd was a little rowdy and not much fun to be around. We were there for the game, but this was worse than expected for any sports bar. Lots of bar pounding and yelling. I know, sounds like whining, but it wasn't fun. We were there to cheer on the Badgers and found it to be a real distraction.   Deak's: the douche next to be was vaping. Is that even legal inside? Whatever. It added to an unpleasant evening. The food was good. The beer was cold. The service was much lower than we were used to. Brian was there and good as ever, but they needed another bartender, or at least one who worked the bar to help Brian out. It was a crowd that could be handled by two Brians or, one and two shmoes instead of the one shmoe that was trying to help."}
{"text":"Our favorite place in stoughton. Great bar food and food tap beer. Friendly service. All around great experience ! For the cool summer nights they have a trendy fire pit outside. Buffalo cheese curds are delicious !!"}
{"text":"Great selection of brew. Also pretty decent food. Staff is always nice. Breakfast here is great and inexpensive!"}
{"text":"The food is good but the service is the opposite. The bartenders are extremely rude and clearly hate being there. Hire bartenders who at least pretend like they care about their PAYING customers."}
{"text":"This is your average sports bar, with a large food menu. They recently went through a renovation which really improved the atmosphere. They now have outdoor seating, 2 bars, and a banquet/party room. The menu hasn't changed much, but the beer selection grew! I am impressed with the large micro-brew selection that is always changing.   The food is average, but there are a few items that I do enjoy. The cheese curds are delicious, especially the buffalo ones. Although I would prefer if they were more spicy. I am bummed that one of my favorite appetizers was recently removed from the menu (it was basically bbq pork on freshly made potato chips). The house smoked wings have too much breading and tend to be soggy after they add sauce.   If you are looking for a place to have a beer while watching a sporting event (football, basketball, hockey, or baseball) this is a great option. Save yourself some $$, skip the food and order a decent  beer instead."}
{"text":"How do you know you are in a smaller than average town?  When you walk in and everyone in the place turns around and looks at you. As I was walking looking for an open table, I kept on thinking, \"You don't know me and I don't know you so let's leave it at that\".  We stopped in on a Friday night for a fish fry and the place was packed to the \"gills\" (no pun attended).  We were able to secure the last available table and waited a few while the servers figured out who was assigned to our table.  Their menu is pretty straight forward as it relates to bar food with a few fish options to choose from on Fridays.  Special props goes to them as they make all their appetizers in house.  I was equally impressed with their beer selection.  While their servers really weren't familiar with the different breweries and styles (I was handed the hand written list and description), luckily I am no stranger to malt beverages and picked out a 3 Sheeps on nitro while my girlfriend went with a belgian.  For our entrees, I selected cod while she veered towards the Ahi Tuna.  Yes, we were on the fence regarding the freshness and quality of the tuna at a sports bar but we threw caution to the wind and went with it.  While the dishes were great, they were not bad as well.  Both suffered a bit from being overcooked.  The batter on the cod tasted great but the fish suffered a bit from dryness.  The Ahi, ordered rare, came out more medium.  Credit to the server for noticing when my girlfriend bit into it but since we were in a rush (and since it still tasted good), she decided not  to send it back.   I am not a frequent visitor to Stoughton but if I was back in the area, I wouldn't object from visiting again.  Even if it was just to grab a beer or two as I think this is the area in which the bar shines."}
{"text":"Friday Night Fish Fry is amazing. We had great food and great service. I recommend the Fried Cod with slaw and fries."}
{"text":"I have to apologize for forgetting our bartender's name.  For the three hours we were there and she was entertaining us, that's my fault.  Boo.  Anyway, Deak's isn't exactly reinventing the wheel here.  It's a bar with tv's, a pool table, happy hour and standard bar menu at typical pricing.  The four of us piled through some late night eating as I worked on upping my alcohol intake while home on leave.  We did the chips and salsa, which were really good (a giant bowl of thick salsa is always welcome) and the app sampler (huge plate of breaded fried things, chips, salsa and bruschetta) to start.  Pretty huge, tasted like it may have been breaded there (as opposed to something straight from the Sysco freezer) and didn't take long.  We also ordered sandwiches, which is the part that made me really like our bartender.  I asked her opinion on which would be the best choice between the club melt or the cuban.  I always like cuban sammiches, but, we're at a bar in Stoughton, so, who knows?  She made a face about the cuban and said it was too much pork in one sandwich (blasphemy, right?) and said she liked the club better.  So, I got the club, Stacy got a chicken thing, we all had a laugh and giant discussion about the merits of different meats, and forgot about it once the apps came.  Then the sammies came out, and she had to apologize.  In her intense dislike of the cuban, she had ordered that and the club instead of Stacy's chicken thing.  Our friend Mel thought that should mean I'd get a taste of the cuban at least, since they'd made it (but didn't bring it out) and I said that, working in a kitchen, that it'd be devoured by staff most likely.  But no, our bartender wrapped it to go for me as a bonus.  How nice of her!  Take that, plus her knowing which taps I wanted to try before I asked (which was a pretty cool trick) and her patience with our friend's fascination with cherry bombs and inappropriate sexual discussions, and know that I genuinely like this place.  It's the first time I've been there, but I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Just went here for fish last Friday.  My wife enjoyed her cod and I had the perch, which I also thought was pretty tasty.  Also, the serving size of the perch is immense--5 pieces for $11.99, pretty good deal if you ask me!"}
{"text":"We live about 5 minutes walk from this bar, nice, clean and trendy. But the food is awful.! Nothing special about their food. First time we went I have the burger with fries, very dry burger tasteless.the only way it gave a little taste to it is when u add the ketchup and mayo. Second try, it was July 4 the weekend, no place open to eat, they're open so we gave it another try. I order the steak tuna sandwich, 4 people in our group.my husband order the perch, it was terrible very dry, over cooked. When I looked around to see what other order, it just complete disappointment, the food with all the people in our group looks like a pre packaged food thrown unto the grill, salad just came out in a bag, put together fast, presentation is aweful.!  Nothing special, tuna sandwich came out with just the fish, a title mayo and about 6 pcs. Of pre package onion rings for $9.00-10.00. I gave this place only one star for the trendy and new place, nothing else is good about this bar and grill. Don't waist your money, Better off to go to Culver's across from it."}
{"text":"Easily my favorite place in the Madison area to eat.  The fish fry is top notch.  The cheese curds are solid.  And they have, hands down, the best Cuban sandwich in the area.  I probably go once a week just for that Cuban.  Also, try the Bucky Burger--it's like the Fresno burger at Hardee's, but you know--good.  And tasty.  If they're packed, the kitchen can get a little slow.  But, I'll forgive them because the food is that good."}
{"text":"So this is a seat your self place. Which is actually kinda nice. They have lots of tv's going with different sports to watch. The soup was amazing and best of all made in house. The steak was perfectly done only problem was it wasn't seasoned well :( but cut was excellent just a slight amount of fat on the edge and good marbling to keep the meat nice and tasty. The grilling was a perfect searing. The servers where very pleasant and helpful in making a dinner selection. When traveling through this is a must stop for food."}
{"text":"I'm here from out of town and I had a local recommend going here for dinner.  The service was awful, almost non existing. The food, at least the ribs, were not that great. They were extra greasy as if they were to have been made in the deep fryer.  On the bright side the cheese curds were good."}
{"text":"Bumpin' up this review with an additional star.  I hadn't been in here in a while, and I must say I was pretty impressed with my visit today.   The food was great. The french fries were outstanding. They are the best. Crispy and lightly salted, perfect texture and flavor was spot on. I also had the chicken pesto sandwich and it was super yummy.   The inside of the restaurant looked great. The new area looks amazing!   Overall, this place is movin' on up!"}
