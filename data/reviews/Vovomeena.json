{"text":"They have an awesome brunch menu. Stomach gravitated towards the Johnnycakes, which hit the spot. Nice outdoor seating in the shade. Really friendly staff and management too!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome! Great food (I've had almost everything on the menu), great hot and cold brew coffee, and great atmosphere. Also, the staff are really friendly! Definitely my go-to breakfast/brunch place in central Phoenix."}
{"text":"Found this place on Yelp, so I had to add to the hype! Not only is the food one step above the rest the staff are beyond polite and accommodating. I can always tell a good business owner when they make a personal stop to your table. I had the biscuits and gravy and they are TO DIE FOR!!"}
{"text":"I've enjoyed breakfast twice so far this year. I'm gluten-free, and both times I ordered grits with the Wilcox Avenue (two egg, sausage and potato plate.) The food is delicious. The first time the grits came smothered in butter. The second visit, I ordered them dry, with a side of maple syrup. I order hot tea and appreciate the bevy of milks and sweeteners. It's best to arrive early to ensure a table. The staff is so attentive and polite."}
{"text":"Vovomeena opened in my neighborhood a few years ago, and I've been maybe 35 or 40 times by this point. The quality of the food rivals, well sorta-almost rivals a Big Breakfast, and while that may not sound like an overt compliment, that is actually high praise! The winner point here is the ability to avoid the turista/gawker contingent that plagues Matt's. You can reasonably expect to get a comfortable seat here except mid-mornings on the weekends, when it does get very crowded. We stopped coming for a while when there were more-than-occasional loud-baby issues at these very crowded times last year; it seems to me that management did nothing to encourage the young parents to perhaps take the unhappy one on a brief outdoor excursion to maybe give a break to the other patrons. This would be less of a problem if the acoustics of the layout were different--Vovomeena can get loud when crowded. Anyway, it's a problem all restaurants face, it just seems Vovomeena didn't quite master the communications with the new-child set. We just started leaving when we'd come in and see babies, and then just stopped coming in altogether when this happened a few times in a row. Things seem to have been sorted on this front in 2015, and so we've returned"}
{"text":"This place is great.  Really cool spot with artwork before you walk in.  The dining room is small and we barely found a place to sit after ordering.  The food however didn't disappoint.  I had the eggs over easy and bacon with hash browns and a fresh biscuit. The hash had caramelized onions and were nice and crispy.  I had the banana bread French toast or Pain Perdu.  I thought it was very creative and delicious. Not too sweet.  The iced Vietnamese coffee was bold and nicely balanced. Would definitely come again."}
{"text":"This place is a tremendous addition to the 7th Ave & McDowell corner - we're very excited to have it so close to home!  I had the Savory Crepes. The filling was delicious and the sauce that topped it was fantastic. My boyfriend has the Pepperonata which he raved about. Even though it was a busy Sunday morning, we got served  more quickly than we expected. The coffee was excellent as well - a vitally important part of any Sunday breakfast!  As another reviewer mentioned, I would like to see more non-meat options on the menu. I'm not a vegetarian, but I'm not big on sausage and pork chops either. I could probably be happy with the crepes on every visit - they are that good - but I'd like to have a few more choices.  I'd gladly up a star too if I saw that happen."}
{"text":"Great food, nice location. The staff is nice. Modern atmosphere. The only complaint I have is they tend to burn the \"boxty\" every time."}
{"text":"I went here based on a yelp review and enjoyed my experience.   First, the decor is very charming and modern. The place has great ambiance and the people that work there seemed genuinely nice.   Second, coffee was amazing! I'm a bit of a coffee snob and chose this place over Matt's Big Breakfast based solely on the rave coffee reviews. Best $2 I ever spent on a cup of joe. It's pour-over quality coffee reminiscent of Blue Bottle Coffee Co. in San Francisco.   Third, the food was pretty good. In our group of three we got the pancakes, potatoes and choice of meat, the savory crepes and the pain perdu.  The pancakes, potatoes and sausage my friend got were average. I tried her potatoes which were my favorite part of her meal.  The crepes were....interesting...but in a good way, like when you first try something and you're not sure you'll like it, so you keep eating, intrigued, and then you decide that this is really good though perhaps more like something you crave every once in a while than something you'd eat regularly....bit of stream of consciousness for you...the pain perdu was too much too sweet....it's a banana bread pudding topped with a sweet and salty, thick caramel sauce and fresh banana slices....you get two brownie-sized squares of it with a side of bacon....I hated that my crunchy bacon was covered in the caramel sauce....I enjoyed this meal because the bread is not sweet, but super sweetened by the caramel sauce...it's just too much for breakfast and would be better if they reduced the portion size of the bread pudding and added some eggs or potatoes....my tummy felt queezy after such a sweet meal...glad my friends shared their meals to portion mine out.   The menu's knid of limited, but I think it keeps the place original. I'd definitely recommend and maybe even return just to sit and sip their delicious coffee."}
{"text":"Had a great experience this afternoon; Japanese cold brew coffee was great and the food delicious...My only comment was the server was too quick in discussing the menu and coffee..felt rushed for their first week introducing themselves. I will be back to tour the menu!"}
{"text":"Yelping it up for a breakfast location on vacation and we were led to vovomeena by the reviews.  Wasn't quite sure what to expect but we were pleasantly surprised. We visited on a Saturday morning around 10:30 a.m. And it was not too busy to be served quickly. You order at a counter and then select an open table and your food is brought to you. It's a small menu but with some great choices.  I tried the Mexican Benedict and really liked it. There is a corn tamale like base instead of an English muffin.  My husband got the blackstone scrambler and enjoyed that. He selected a multi grain toast that was amazing.  He also asked about recommended coffee and we tried the flight of cold brewed regular and flavored coffees which was unique and enjoyable.  I love the decor and the baristas were very helpful.   On a side note I really enjoyed my silverware. It was heavy duty and nice to hold.  :) Loved this place and wish we had one near home."}
{"text":"My family and I tried Vovomeena for the first time today and we were impressed. My husband had the Mexican Benedict and I had the Johnnycakes. Both dishes were delicious! We shared the coffee flight and each one was unique and tasty. Great price too! We are definitely coming back to try the other dishes. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Had brunch there today with my husband and daughter.  Would they come back?  Most definitely not.  Would I come back?  Maybe, in a year or two assuming they stay in business.    Would I encourage people to try this place?  Yes, but on a leisurely day, and not when you want to impress or be impressed.     The space is pleasant: ample outside seating, high ceilings, narrow hall running east west with plenty of light coming in from both ends.  They have a limited but ample menu with items that conceptually sound delicious.  (You know, like Tuck and Astor House.)  After more than 40 minutes of waiting, we had: 1.  boxty (grated apple & potato pancakes, honey mascarpone, choice of meat).  The grated apple is not cooked into the pancakes but put on top.  Honey mascarpone was sickeningly sweet, and pancakes were peppery -- weird combination.  I picked sausage as my meat choice but it wasn't served with my boxty.  I asked the server \"Was I supposed to get sausage with my boxty?\"  She responded, \"I don't know, were you?\"   I showed her the menu and the sausages were brought out shortly; but response was borderline rude and at best it showed she didn't know the menu which had 12 items on it.    2.  johnnycakes (corn and chiles, stack of three, sweet rice & fruit, choice of meat).  This might have been the best item from the three that we ordered.  The pancakes were beautifully browned; like fluffy cornbread.  But something was missing to tie the flavors of the pancakes, sausage, sweet rice & fruit together.  Maybe syrup?  Maybe a butter chile sauce?  But the sweet rice needs to go.  3.  piperrada (fry up of pork shoulder, green & red peppers, tomato, onion, two eggs on top).  The number one ingredient in the entree description was barely there.  Hubby did the rude thing of picking his food apart right after it came, maybe because he was not happy that his first two picks (grillades and mexican benedict) were not available.  Table manners aside, when he removed the two eggs from the top of the pile, the underneath was mostly red and green peppers and onions.  If you pieced together the pork shoulder pieces like a jigsaw puzzle, it might have ended up being the size of a small bacon strip.  Tomatoes were also missing.  Two separate people asked if everything was going ok and my hubby told both of them that he was not happy about the pork shoulder.  But nothing was offered, no substitution, no refund, nada.    I don't remember the last time my husband complained in a restaurant.   That is usually my gig, and even I don't often do it.  Today I had a feeling any complaints would fall on deaf ears. We had to wait quite a while for a food and during that time  I saw several customers going to the counter making non-positive gesticulations and being met with a response that I could lip read as \"So sorry.\"  I also saw four very frustrated cooks who spent quite a bit of time looking at the ticket items while very little food was coming out of the kitchen.    We felt bad for everyone:  the cooks, the owners, the patrons, and us.  Such a downer for a brunch.   From our table, I ate the most food in hopes of eventually understanding the concept from each dish.  (If it matters, I wear size 0 pants and am not prone to just eating anything and everything.)   In the end, while my daughter looked at me in disdain, I told her I just needed the calories to make up for the effort in getting there, for the wait, and for the money spent.  Supporting local businesses is a must, but it shouldn't be painful. I think Vovomeena could be good someday if it works out its kinks.  But I'll wait a long while before I risk another downer of a brunch again."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious breakfast, and some unique choices on the menu as well. Not just your typical eggs and toast kind of place.   I went with 2 friends- I got the Johnny Cakes which were phenomenal, and a huge portion too. It came with 2 sausage links and fresh strawberries on top, a side of the most incredible homemade rice pudding I've ever tasted, with syrup on the side. Soooo good! My friends got the Pain Perdu and the French toast. I love how they do the cold drip coffee as well and U can see the drip system up on the wall.   The line moved quick (you order at the register and then they give you a number and you wait at a table). Also they do not permit you to hold a table while your party goes up and orders and that's something they enforce. You choose your table only after ordering. They bring the food out to you. Service was great as well. Will definitely be back!!!!"}
{"text":"Wicked fast service.  Cold brewed coffee is a nice change.  Good variety of menu choices."}
{"text":"Heard about this place on Check Please.  The program is always positive, so you have to be aware that their recommendation might be oversold.  Although, it is not very classy and upscale place, the menu and coffee is really good.  Arrived later in the morning for good seating.  It is very popular.  I wonder why?   Their BMOC is a special dish; they were out when we ordered. But it gets rave reviews. Not to worry, there are many good choices on the menu.  Very frustrating when you want to order almost everything on the menu.  Their Japanese cold-brewed coffee is also a special attraction.  Nothing quite like it.  You order and find a seat.  They bring food to your table.  Parking is a little tight in that area."}
{"text":"The menu is honest and clear: no substitutions. That being said, I couldn't help it. My heart wanted the one omelette option on the menu to be a chorizo omelette instead of a potato omelette. When I asked for the change, the portly hipster behind the counter gave me that look. The one that says, \"dude, we're so popular right now we don't have to give you anything.\"  He told me they aren't able to change a thing. I ordered the waffle, bacon, and potoatoes, with a side of scrambled eggs. The waffle wasn't my favorite kind (I prefer one that's crunchy on the outside and soft and delicious on the inside). This waffle was just soft, like a pancake. The eggs were typical. Not fluffy air goodness, like I always hope eggs will be. Bacon was limp and fatty.  Sometimes I feel like a breakfast spot like this gets its high ratings mostly because it tries very hard to be unique and trendy, less than because the food is actually delicious. But I'll be honest: I've never craved a pork chop in my breakfast, and this place isn't changing my mind on that front.   If you're wanting pancakes and the like (basically dessert) then you're going to love their options here. But c'mon, you could go to a million hip places in the valley that offer a carb-rich, sugar filled pancake and be thrilled. The real posers of breakfast are revealed in how they do the non-carb options. Sorry Vovomeena. For me, you're nothing more than a hipster poser. Great coffee though."}
{"text":"Fantastic brunch.  It was busy but got a table in 5 min.  My waffle with pork chop was amazing, and my sons biscuit and gravy was the best he has ever tasted."}
{"text":"What can I say about this place..AWESOME! The food is so freaking good there is nothing i haven't tried that I didn't like, it can get pretty packed but it is definitely worth the wait, reasonably priced. I guarantee you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"We're from Buffalo, NY, so we are here based solely on reviews. Vovomeena did not disappoint! Our food was extraordinary. I had the johnnycakes with spuds. Oh. My. God. Make sure to ask for the Chilula, the green hot sauce with the wooden top."}
{"text":"Cold coffee, cold donut, flies EVERYWHERE, biscuit was hard as a rock, plate was so loaded with gravy it engulfed the egg on top, items listed on the menu that staff had to apologize are not \"yet\" available, patio seating so 1 person is directly in the sun, and one's in the shade, I won't be back, very poor experience."}
{"text":"This place was suggested, and I'm glad it was. The food was amazing and so was the atmosphere. The menu is short and simple. Tried the Mexican benedict. It was love at first bite."}
{"text":"The banana bread French toast was amazing. The chorizo in the Mexican eggs Benedict overpowers the dish but it wasn't bad - just not the best Benedict I've eaten. Just avoid the coffee flight - overpriced, bitter and undrinkable."}
{"text":"I am always out for a good breakfast place so I was happy to have a new one near our home in downtown Phoenix. Unfortunately my husband and I were pretty disappointed with our food. The Coffee was awesome but the food was way too greasy and way too salty, I felt sick the rest of the day. This all coming from someone who typically likes salty food. I realize breky can be a greasy treat but this was too much fat and salt for my taste.  We tried it again to give it a second chance and went with a friend who happened to be a Vegan. There was nothing on the menu she could eat. It's 2013 ya gotta be a little accommodating to other peoples food restrictions in a restaurant. So, two strikes and you're out in my book."}
{"text":"I went there for the first time and I have to admit it was pretty good. I had the Pain Perdue and it was delicious. It could have used a lil more sauce, but it was good! This place is kind of hidden and can easily be overlooked. Its definitely a must try place!!"}
{"text":"I LOVE this place! I just wish I lived closer so I could go more often.  I went on a weekday after picking up a friend from the airport.  I had the best biscuits and gravy I've ever had and my friend had amazing pancakes that are so delicious, you could eat them plain without any syrup or fruit!  My only issue was that the self-serve coffee wasn't hot anymore.  However that was back in November and we were there around 11 am.  They also have neat Japanese cold-press (or drip?)coffee setup that my barista friend was excited about."}
{"text":"Truly excellent breakfast. Unique and traditional dishes all cooked to perfection. The Tortilla Española is divine and the BMOC is as hearty as you can get. Superb coffee bar as well. Inexpensive for the portions. Will be frequenting this establishment for breakfast going forward. So glad we gave it a try today. I had to go straight home and lay down afterwards, so filling, so satisfied. Totally earned the 5 star rating."}
{"text":"Delicious breakfast, NOT low-calorie!  It's in an odd strip mall, missed it our first time around.  Biscuits are delicious.  Self-serve coffee, casual yet efficient service.  We had a late breakfast, but I imagine it's busy early in the morning."}
{"text":"Vovomeena is our 'go to' spot when family is in town visiting (we brunch here as a family of 4 every month or so, but make the extra effort to bring visiting relatives here to show off the culinary delights Phoenix has to offer.)  A few key elements set Vovomeena as the bar for us: 1. quaint menu, quality ingredients, presentation {we've tried 75% of the breakfast menu- all excellent, but we keep coming back to the Pain Perdu & Mexican Eggs Benedict}; 2. friendly & familiar faces : the staff at Vovomeena stick around. It's nice to recognize faces behind the counter & in the kitchen. It doesn't have to be an \"everybody knows your name\" kind of place to feel just welcoming enough; 3. location & atmosphere. It's nestled in a perfect location just off I-10; to add, the outdoor seating is lovely & indoor decor & 'space' gives a great vibe even for family dining (we usually need 2 highchairs at our table).  Thank you, Vovomeena, for a consistent, thoughtful & enjoyable dining experience in the Valley!"}
{"text":"I hate to do this, because I don't want this place to be busy for selfish reasons, however I have an obligation to uphold. It is of no surprise that Vovomeena is anything but fantastic, coming from the flavor dense minds from Tuck Shop and Astor House.  This morning I got their signature Japanese iced coffee and the Espanola which was kind of an egg, potato, spinach and cheese pie with a chunky red sauce that is bursting with flavors.  The decor is sustainable and hip, chairs were comfortable, lighting is good, staff is friendly and personable as well... Can you tell I like the place?"}
{"text":"Well if your looking to bring a group or family DON'T! You order from a small menu first pay and sit wherever.  It is clean quaint has a contemporary look. This place is nice for a college student or two people in a hurry. The food was okay but nothing off the charts! The coffee is put in thermal pumps you get yourself I was not too jazzed up about that  being that I seen a review for top 10 Phoenix breakfast spots. The cashier guy was a little snooty when I asked a question stated its right there pick two of those choices. The manager did come buy ask if it was okay, but who wants to complain when your trying to visit with old friends. The staff was nice who delivered our order. I ordered the chorizo benidict which looked good but they left all the grease on my plate! Will not be back!"}
{"text":"The best coffee I've ever had!! I also had the French toast w honey, marscapone cheese and grated apple. So delicious and the atmosphere is trendy and everyone working there was so friendly"}
{"text":"I have been here about 4 times.   Originally I was excited about their eclectic menu and decor, but now things are just not adding up for me.    My eggs were over cooked, dry and bland, while the potatoes are thick, not cooked enough and starchy (others may enjoy this).   I also am weary of standing in line to order, then another line for drinks, then another line for a table.  I sat outside and while I was being attacked by flies and not enjoying their iced tea which to me is do bitter it tastes like coffee got blended into it, I realized that the tables are so narrow that I couldn't read a magazine while eating my food.    I wondered was I just being a cranky pants that needed more caffiene or was the original hope and promise that I was enticed by just not working for me at vovomeena.   I think you can tell what I landed upon.  Sorry vovomeena."}
{"text":"Thank you vovo! Everything I've tried is delicious. The manager here is wonderful and really wants to make sure every customer is 100% happy with their food and experience. The kind of customer service I experienced here today makes me want to come here more often. And I will! Thank you!"}
{"text":"This is a great place for breakfast. The staff and manager were very accommodating for our party of 10. The food is excellent and was enjoyed by all. They worked with me on my order since I have to eat gluten free.  The coffee is the best!!! We will be back!!!"}
{"text":"Place was OK. For having to seat yourself and get your own beverages , the taste of the food and the price was not worth it. The place is deafeningly loud and small. It is not large enough to seat very many. This place doesn't make me want to come back."}
{"text":"The Blackstone Scramble is amazing - the pork is incredibly flavorful and the portions abundant. Perfect spot to meet friends and relax on a Saturday morning."}
{"text":"Every single dish is perfect.  Our only problem is deciding which ones to get this time.  Enough said."}
{"text":"The coffee flight, and the tortilla espanola are a must try. Three different kinds of herb/spiced infused (tea-like) iced coffees, all delicious. The tortilla espanola looks like it would be a greasy, heavy meal but it was actually very light and refreshing! I like the casual setting and ordering at the register. It helps a lot that there a lot of nice, charming, and cute boys working there. Definitely Glad to have this place in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Really like their spin on breakfast.  Dishes are a little more adventurous then your typical breakfast fare, which is why I like them.  Food is cooked well.  I love the Johhnny Cakes for breakfast and the warm rice pudding it comes with."}
{"text":"I was excited when this breakfast restaurant opened up in my neighborhood as I love to go out for breakfast almost everyday.  I have eaten there 3 times now but I only order 1 thing on the menu which I do enjoy quite a bit because their other items are a little unusual for me.  I went to eat there again yesterday and I was very sorry to see they have removed all side items off their menu. So I cannot order an omelet or 2 scrambles eggs with bacon, or a side of toast. Its one of the nine items or nothing. That does not work for me so that is why i have given this restaurant 3 stars. I hope they reconsider offering the basic breakfast items or I will probably not be back."}
{"text":"Food was excellent, service was so personable and cashier woman so nice and they were just so great on top of everything, bmoc was great and so was the banana french toast. Coffee was strong and they don't deny that at all but well worth it with the food, no question I will be returning."}
{"text":"If I could give 12 stars on the Moonshine Cold Brew alone....I would, and hard.    This gold establishment takes cold brew coffee to a whole new realm of  \"MORE Sir, YUSS'PLEASE!\"  Mouthwatering and mind-bending combinations like chocolate-basil and lavender-mint fresh flavors IN MY CRISP COLD BREW???     Clearly, the fella behind these masterful concoctions deserves a nobel peace prize and about 64 high-fives for his exquisitely crafted cardiovascular-zapping efforts.       Me:      *Sip*   *makes O-face* The Scientist:     Creme? Me:     No thank you, she's perfect.  *Golf clap*  The food....maybe later, I'm so gushin'on the Moonshine my food is going to get cold :)"}
{"text":"Awesome coffee. Amazing food (mexican benedict). Good music.   Though for a first-timer, like I was, the ordering process is a little different. It is a counter-order resturant but there are no \"order here\" signs which makes you feel kind of lost when you first walk in. But the staff is extremely helpful and always willing to point you in the right direction without making you feel like a dumbass.   I will definitely recommend to others and come back for more coffee!"}
{"text":"Best breakfast spot in Phx / Scottsdale. Normally, there's only 1-2 two things on a menu that grab your eye. However, here there's always 5-6 things my wife and I have to decide over. Probably prefer the Mexican benedict the most. Actually, the only thing that disappoints is the Portugese donut that Howard raved about. Almost don't want to post this as concerned it will just be more popular. Nice kids menu options as well."}
{"text":"Love this independent nestled into the corner of chain eateries. Not to be missed!  Thrilled to live in the 'hood so I can walk here."}
{"text":"They have local coffe that is awesome! The Service is really fast and the food is yummy. Im not really a breakfast person but the food was fresh good. I think my favorite this is the coffee and the homeaid jam for the toast. Awesome cute place."}
{"text":"This place was recommended by friends, so glad I decided to try it out. Good food, great atmosphere, I highly recommend it, stop in for delicious food!!"}
{"text":"Had breakfast here the other Sunday morning and the food was amazing. Great flavors and a fantastic variety for carnivores. If you are in the mood for some comfort food and have a few calories to spare this place is great. We also had a little breakfast/dessert the banana bread french toast was really good. It was a little small and the coffee bar set up is kinda weird even still amongst all the good places to have breakfast these guys still stand out."}
{"text":"Great bfast, a little bit pricey. Its hard to find a seat over the weekends but the food is really good."}
{"text":"Wilcox Avenue and fresh OJ were delicious! The only thing I don't like is the order first and then wait to be seated ordeal. The place is great, rustic modern and small at the end i will still be returning."}
{"text":"Excellent service. Here from OC to see Ohio State- New Year's Day. There are open today! Great cold brew coffee. Fantastic breakfast and they have kids meal too. Thank you- I love my coffees."}
{"text":"I'm so excited about the latest restaurant opening from the folks that created Tuck Shop. Vovomeena is a perfect addition to the 7th Avenue and McDowell corner, which is mostly occupied by chain restaurants. They serve up incredible Japanese cold brew coffee, which makes me wonder if I can ever go back to a plain ol' Starbucks drip. The coffee has great, bold flavor and not bitterness. They have a few varieties and even offer a coffee flight.  The star of the menu is the B.M.O.C. It's a Man Vs. Food-kind of dish -- Schreiner'ssmoked pork chop, waffle two eggs and a Portuguese donut tower with apple-maple syrup. And yes it can be finished in one sitting. The 3 Sister Strata -- a egg and cheese casserole, with zucchini, black beans and corn, is delicious, hearty, yet light. It comes with a side of meat, bacon or sausage, both of which come from Schreiner's Fine Sausages on 7th Street. I love that they source local ingredients, from meat to coffee.   I'm eyeing the Pain Perdu --banana bread pudding french toast --for my next visit or maybe the johnnycakes, made with corn and chili. You really can't go wrong with this menu."}
{"text":"The food was \"fine\" but not worth the price or the service. A couple of smiling faces amongst staff, but we could have done without the snootiness. Breakfast is a competitive game, your money is better spent elsewhere."}
{"text":"Price - reasonable range Service - prompt and friendly  Atmosphere - parking kind of hard but has a nice outdoor area . Overall neat and hip Food - flavorful :) pretty decent overall."}
{"text":"My hubby and I have a standing ritual of having Sunday brunch together.  This week we decided to go to the independent standout, on what I call \"chain restaurant row\" on 7th Ave and McDowell.   And for those who live in South Phoenix/Laveen area, like we do, the trip took us an easy 15 minute drive in Sunday traffic to downtown.  If you are going for Sunday breakfast, being an early riser has it's advantages.  I recommend going between the hours of 8:30 and 10:30 am.  We arrived at 10:15am and witnessed  the place fill up quickly at 10:30am.  We entered the restaurant from the 7th Ave parking lot.  Vovomeena's has an entrance via the patio.   When you enter from the patio, it's a bit confusing orientation.  To the right you will see the kitchen and that's where you start by grabbing a menu off the wall, stand in line, and place/pay your order at the cashier.  They will give you a number and the server brings the food to the table when ready.   I recommend looking over the menu online prior to your visit, because frankly, I imagine this process to be backed up when the place is crowded by the newbies trying to decide what they want to eat -- there isn't much space to move, so the pressure is on.  I noted there were quite a few family with kids.  While my husband and I have a son, we were on a \"date brunch\" so we chose to sit AWAY from the families :)    I do imagine the patio - during nice whether - to be a perfect spot to have a family breakfast so don't be afraid to bring them along.  But let's get to the food!   Vovomeena's serves up such creative concoctions http://www.vovomeena.com/menu.html  I enjoyed the \"Johnnycakes\", described  on the menu as two chile corn hotcakes, prickly pear maple syrup, served with a side of  sweet rice, and choice of meat.   Layman translation:  sweet corn tamale (with chile) pancakes, rice pudding, and either bacon or schreiner sausage.   I loved my meal - but was not a fan of the prickly pear maple syrup (so much that my husband was reminded of a scene from the Tom Hanks movie \"Big\" when he chews and spits out his food.)  On our next visit, I look forward to trying the \"Mexican Benedict\" , poached eggs, hollandaise sauce, served on sopes.   This is the kind of interesting culinary twists you can expect to see on the menu.  There is plenty on the menu to keep me entertained and no negative experience to be critical of.     Check it out!"}
{"text":"The food was great, the coffee rich and delicious, and even though our party was larger (10 people) and the inside seating is pretty tight, the staff was very accomdating and helpful arranging seats for our whole party.  I'll be back!"}
{"text":"I came here because of the high reviews and was thoroughly disappointed. I ordered biscuit and gravy and I was very surprised how salty it was-- I tolerate a lot of salt, and it was way beyond acceptable.  I also shared BMT? Which the ham was again unbelievably charred and salty. I looked for potatoes to go down with the rest of the salt and refilled water 4 times.  Waffles were okay, no better than most places I have been to."}
{"text":"This was a really chill spot with friendly staff and yummy eats making it a nice place to stop in & out."}
{"text":"Best breakfast I've had in a long time! We went on a Sunday morning around 11 am. You stand in line, order, then are seated by staff. The line went fast and food came pretty quick too, considering our mouths were watering just from seeing what others seated around us had ordered. I ordered the Wilcox Avenue which came with 2 eggs cooked to order (I got over medium and they were perfect), breakfast potatoes (well seasoned chunks and perfectly cooked with nice crispy bits), choice of toast or biscuit (GET THE BISCUIT!!!! SERIOUSLY!!! ), and choice of breakfast meat (I got bacon and it was thick cut and nicely cooked, not too crispy and not too flimsy). The biscuit was buttery, flakey, just melts in your mouth. Also comes with side of FRESH strawberry jam. I added a side of the homemade gravy to dip my biscuit in, which has nice chunks of shreiners sausage. Well seasoned. Creamy. So good. To say it was delicious is a huge understatement. My husband got the Blackstone scramble which came with sliced pork shoulder (think nicely smoked really good thick ham pieces), 2 eggs scrambled with onion, garlic, tomato and peppers. This was served with a delicious homemade mouth watering tortilla to wrap it all up in, breakfast burrito style if you desire. My 12 year old daughter got the 12 and under kids choice called the Primrose Hill with choice 3 items: pancake or waffle (she got the waffle which tasted so slightly sweet yummy vanilla malted butter-so so good), eggs, and bacon or sausage. She couldn't even finish half of the waffle it was so thick! We opted for waters which was self service by the coffee area which was also interesting. I would definitely return just for the biscuit and gravy. It was all so filling. I didn't get any pictures because we ate it so fast!"}
{"text":"I love the indie restaurants that fill up old buildings and provide a delicious meal in a warm, inviting space.  Brunch at Vovomeena was also enough to fill me up for the whole day.    Two of us had a BMOC and a pain perdu.  It was a nice combo, hearty, savory, sweet.  The BMOC's tender waffle is a counterpoint to all of the other goodness that smothers it while the smoked pork chop is in small pieces to make the eating easier.  Pain perdu is a luscious excuse to eat bread pudding for a meal!  Ask for the syrups and sauces on the side so that you can customize your sugar rush.  The ginger morning moonshine was good, but I'll probably pass on the next trip and there will be another visit in the plans soon."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere. Great coffee. Interesting options for food. Had the Mexican Benedict. Very good, but could have used more hollandaise. Slightly on the hipster side."}
{"text":"A couple of my friends wanted to take me out to breakfast today.  I wanted to try this place.  They're locally owned, and the menu looked good.  I got a combo of pancakes, bacon and potatoes.  It has a place name, which I don't remember.  Everything was so dry.  I HATE it when a restaurant parcels out the syrup in little containers.  Just put a pitcher of syrup on my table, please.  Extra syrup could not render the pancakes finish-able.  The potatoes were also likewise very dry.  I only finished the bacon.  I didn't order, since I was the birthday guest, but it looks like you order your food and coffee at separate counters.  Is that the case?  And if so, is that necessary?  Do I really want to stand in 2 lines for my breakfast?  No.  I don't even want to stand in one line.  Unless that line is at Matt's.  Around 11:00, the music got so loud I had trouble hearing my friends talking.  And there were a LOT of kids there, if you're into that thing.  Also, I have had TERRIBLE reflux all day.  And that's all I've eaten today.  Just saying."}
{"text":"The tortilla espanola is the most delicious dish I have had! The arugula salad pairs perfectly with this Spanish quiche- like creation. The Johnny cakes and the sweet rice are phenomenal. The manager was very accommodating on busy Sunday morning, while the line is out the door! Everything here is on another level; the aesthetics, the Japanese cold-brew, and the open kitchen. I am proud have this local spot in our community."}
{"text":"Excellent food at this out of the way place. Portions  very large and fresh. I want to try everything on the menu. Plan to go back every weekend until I've tried all menu items. Coffee was also delicious and friendly servers"}
{"text":"I had a chance to sit down with the owner of this spot today.  I'm hoping that he'll be able to make some very minor modifications on the menu to account for the vegan population of downtown Phoenix.  Otherwise, I do believe that the owner cares about his businesses and the community.  Fingers crossed.   -- ORIGINAL Review:  Since the corner of McDowell and 7th Ave. is what I refer to as the place where chain restaurants go to die, it makes me happy that there's a local breakfast joint attempting to infiltrate the system.  The first time I ate here was a couple of weeks ago, early on a Sunday and it was delicious.  You walk up to the counter to order, get a number and then sit where you like.  It's small, but there's a nice outdoor patio which should be nice for the next couple of weeks.  Their coffee is amazing and they provide dairy alternatives for those of us who do not use cream in our coffee.    The first time I ordered the BMOC:  a waffle with apple/maple syrup, a smoked porkchop and eggs. (and a portuguese donut!)  Wowza.  Breakfast heaven. The second time I attempted to order the 3 Sisters Strata, but they hadn't received some order or something and it wasn't available, so I settled on the savory crepes.  Also delicious.  Their romesco sauce is delish.  HOWEVER - I can only give three stars.  My vegan friends are simply not able to eat here because whomever wrote the menu just doesn't provide easy alternatives and the second time I ate here my friend's pancakes showed up in 5 minutes while my fiance and I continued to wait an additional 30!  The manager was great about it and very professional, but his excuse about how pancakes are made faster than the rest is ridiculous - when there are orders that take longer, you simply make the longest item first and work your way up.    I'll probably be back, but I'm seriously hoping for some vegan alternatives on the menu and better time management."}
{"text":"Welcoming atmosphere.  The food and coffee are spot on. Employees were on point and attentive.    I'll be back when I'm in Phoenix!"}
{"text":"Strange set up but delicious food and great wait staff. Worth your time and money. When you walk in the door, you wait in line against a narrow walk way to be seated. The line goes quick but it's awkward."}
{"text":"GLUTEN-FREE FRIENDLY! Oh, and delicious.   It was my first visit and the guy at the register (possibly the owner? manager?) pointed out at least 4 dishes that were either totally gluten free or could be adjusted. I went with the Mexican Benedict and I was pleasantly surprised with how crunchy the sopes turned out to be. The chorizo was delicious and the poached eggs were perfect. The potatoes could have had some crunch and/or seasoning, but... obviously not a deal breaker since I still cleaned my plate.   The possible owner/manager also walked by and asked each table about their meal. I know a lot of places do that, but it seemed really genuine here.  I know they have fancy coffee here, but I just got a regular ol' cup. Loved that they had raw sugar cubes. I'll be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Oh My Gosh this place was delicious! I was only in town for the weekend and a friend recommended this restaurant. I had the johnnycakes and I loved every bite! I drink coffee on occasion, but I had to have two cups that morning because the coffee was that yummy! All of the staff I spoke with were really nice and I can't wait to go back again!"}
{"text":"Perfect local spot!  I've been hoping for something locally owned that strays away from the same chain offerings to be found elsewhere and was not disappointed.  (5)The service was exceptionally friendly from the greeting to the ordering.  Even the bussing of the table was done with a smile.  The owner/manager checked with us several times to make sure everything was ok.  We went early enough that there was no wait and the food was served within 10 min.  (4)We ordered the boxty and the piperrada with iced Japanese Brew.  I agree with Michael U that the boxty was a tiny bit greasy, but the sweet savory flavor with the added texture of apple crunch was a great mouthful.  The crunchy thick bacon on the side was perfect! The piperrada had good flavor.   I was hoping the pork shoulder would be slow cooked and shredded, but it seemed more like a chopped cured ham type flavor/consistency.   Thanks Vovomeena for a great early breakfast.  Will be coming back until we try every menu item, especially can't wait to taste the portuguese donuts someone else raved about!"}
{"text":"This place does NOT disappoint! I saw this place on Check Please so of course had to try! We walked in on a Friday morning at 9am me and my 2 trusty co-worker/friends. We greeted by the very friendly very helpful manager. I wanted coffee ASAP! So I got the iced cup of Japanese cold brew. Which I enjoyed very much! You order at the counter and staff brings your food to the table, finding a table at that time was not too bad as everyone was eating and leaving pretty timely.   For breakfast I had the Wilcox Avenue which was 2 eggs, the best potatoes ever, biscuit and sausage! And yes I added the Portuguese donut!! Everything was amazing! My friend had the pancakes bacon and spuds which was delish as well! My other friend ordered the same as I but with a side of gravy for her biscuit which I normally do not like but she had me taste it and it was the best gravy! The whole place reminded us of our grandma's kitchen! This is REAL comfort good food cooked right to order! It is a nice clean classy diner feel to it! I told the manager we would be back soon, as we were.. the very next Friday! We are calling Vovomeena our little secret and getaway from work!"}
{"text":"The food here is phenomenal!!! Service is GREAT, very prompt and friendly. Definitely coming back here!!"}
{"text":"Great breakfast! I read the great reviews and I'm definitely glad I came here! I had the pancakes, potatoes and bacon. The meal was wonderful. The pancakes look thin, but they were so filling that I could only eat one! The meal is the type you think you could make at home, but it's waaaay better than anything I could make. It's simple with a twist. I'll be back and this time I'm going for the tortilla espanola!"}
{"text":"Started watching this place when they opened as I am a fan of Tuck Shop.  Went here for the first time in January after I had seen them post their special on FB of their sausage gravy and biscuits.  Served with fried eggs on top, this single dish made me a loyal fan.  It is amazing as is the Japanese cold brew.  Husband ordered the BMOC which was good and kids had the pancakes - SO light and fluffy!!  The barristas at the coffee station were very nice and explained the process of the cold brew.  They took time to give me samples - great service for sure."}
{"text":"Full disclosure: I'm not a pretentious foodie.  But, I do enjoy a wonderful meal and we found one today at Vovomeena.  The pain perdu (banana bread pudding french toast with whiskey caramel sauce) will be a contender for my last meal.  The service, simple atmosphere and price point were equally delicious.  Vovomeena management, get yourself to Chicago!"}
{"text":"This restaurant came highly recommended to us and we were hugely disappointed. Be forewarned there are no substitutions in the menu. Service was not good. Very overpriced for the food so they need to offer more; maybe biscuits with the meal. You have to buy them individually. Now to our food, I ordered my eggs over medium and the yolks had been broken and overcooked to the point of being burnt - they should not have been served.  I ordered bangers and they were not bangers just some kind of sausage. Biscuits were hard and overcooked. Because of our bad service we were offered a free meal but we will not be back. The food is just not that good."}
{"text":"Wow! I had a great breakfast! The BMOC. Who would've thought that a pork chop would pair so well with a waffle? It was tied together perfectly with apple compote and maple syrup. Topped with two eggs sunny side up, it was the perfect combination of savory and sweet. I was pleasantly surprised that the pork chop was smoked,  which really made it pop! On the side was a warm Portuguese donut, which is like a fritter, only less dense and sprinkled with powdered sugar. Although very oily, it was sweet and delicious. The coffee was excellent, roasted locally in Cave Creek.   The atmosphere of the restaurant was modern and traditional fused together. It's small, but well lit, and family friendly. I was intrigued by the walk up format and the tiny front kitchen. It is a wonder that they work so efficiently and quickly there. The service was fast and friendly. The prices were good, nothing more than $12, and the majority of the small menu breakfast entrees were $8-9. A great value.  I do believe I've found my new favorite breakfast diner!"}
{"text":"An awesome time with my wife, she loved the potato and orchard French-toast. My eggs Benedict was well seasoned, a little intense for me. I did not have the eggs runny, that might have taken away from overall intended taste. We sampled six flavors of coffee, all good. Reasonable prices and friendly hosts."}
{"text":"THE BEST BREAKFAST PLACE IN THE VALLEY, hands down!    I've tried almost everything on their menu.  There's nothing I didn't like.  The only negative thing I can say is that seating (self-seating in this place) can be a little difficult and annoying during busy times, not fun when you have kid/s in tow.  Even more annoying is seeing people lingering over their completed meals and empty cups of coffee, chatting away like they have nothing else to do all day, while there are people waiting for a table to open up.  Not Vovomeena's fault, but the seating issue has factored into my decisions when I find myself wanting to eat here late morning on a weekend.   Anyway, the food is great, the staff is great (I LOVE YOU KAI !!!)  Eat here.  Eat here often.  You won't be sorry!"}
{"text":"Came here a while ago when my friend worked here!! The restaurant is so adorable and the patio is beautiful. I went back in November when it was really nice weather out so the patio was packed already.   The food was so delicious. You just walk up to the counter and order, and then they bring your food to you. I got the johnnycake and they were amazing! It was a huge plate of food...so it's a good deal for the price. The pancakes were huge, and you get a couple of sides. I remember having this rice pudding with golden raisins that was really good."}
{"text":"This was the best breakfast place I have encountered by far. The food was out of my world. It had the best authentic flavors, quality ingredients, and spectacular ingredients to enhance the savory food together as a whole."}
{"text":"Eclectic and trendy ambiance with delicious choices. It's the place to introduce a friend to and enjoy a brunch that offers more than the \"same old\" options."}
{"text":"The outside patio is relaxingly gorgeous in the mornings (though maybe it won't be so much during June, July and August).   The interior was very modern and cozy. The had a display of vacuum coffee makers, which I thought was really cool-- I'm pretty sure the employee I talked to about them made them. The coffee bar is off to the side and is nicely setup.  Had the eggs benedict-- it was southwestern style. Ridiculously good. Boyfriend and I are eggs benedict fiends.  I remember all these other goodies on their menu I wanted to try-- will return for a second round!"}
{"text":"Want to talk about the heart of a restaurant grand view of that here, as you wait in line for your fantastic meal you get a up close and personal with the line here watching them work hand anD hand together is amazing"}
{"text":"The cold press Japanese iced coffee was delightful and the biscuits and gravy was tasty and not too salty which I often find with this dish.  The sausage may have been turkey but I'm not sure.  The Mexican Benedict is good the first few bites but the fat/greasy in the chorizo over powers the dish and soaks the sopes.   Perhaps less chorizo could improve this dish but The flavor was acceptable and the potatoes were a nice pair.  The breakfast potatoes were Cooked well and seasoned perfectly.   I enjoyed the decor, coffee bar and the service was well above average.     I will visit again for lunch next time."}
{"text":"I must say this, I love the food here. Absolutely delicious food and have never been disappointed w the food quality. However, I am rating this place 3 stars because of one particularly rude staff member. Nothing ruins a good meal/experience more so than rude food servers."}
{"text":"I had the savory crepes, which were outstanding! The hubby had the banging pocket, which looked impressive but the pita bread was too soggy for him. I, on the other hand, actually liked them!"}
{"text":"The best place in Phoenix for breakfast. It's this tiny little spot with kitschy decor, fresh flowers on every table and great food at reasonable prices. Best staff, too. There aren't enough good things to say about this place. Self serve coffee bar  and everything prepared fresh every day. I love it."}
{"text":"This place is awesome it serves good food, memories of home with awesome decor loved every bite. Will be on a mission to try every plate :-)"}
{"text":"First time here! Amazing food and coffee. This coffee was legit! I've come back several times now... won't mention how many visits.  Food is worth the wait. You will not be disappointed. It does get really busy so go in early."}
{"text":"I am big on breakfast, I mean it's super important. I like to think of Vovomeena as inspiration for me to open a breakfast restaurant in the future. I LOVE this place! I've tried almost everything, everything is so so good. Of all the times I've visited, never been disappointed. Ice coffee is bomb! Tortilla espanola, bmoc, waffle, pain perdue, everything is great! The staff is also very friendly. When I took my dog to the patio, they came out with a bowl of water and offered that I buy her a cold protein snack! Always looking forward to my next visit!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places in town. The kitchen is clean, the staff is friendly, the food and coffee taste fresh and delicious. What more do you need? I have been here with quite a few other people, and they all have seemed to enjoy it as much as I do."}
{"text":"The awesome thing about this restaurant is the front of house staff. They are always friendly, attentive, and just fun to talk to. They make you feel at home.  The food is wonderful, and the decor is just as wonderful. The parking, however, is impossible after 10am. Go early.  The kitchen area is a little disorganized and disheveled, but the kitchen staff manages to crank out quality and good tasting dishes at a good pace.    I'll definitely be back. The food and service is superior. I'll just avert my eyes next time I'm standing towards the kitchen. OK I'm lying: I always look and cannot stop."}
{"text":"great neighborhood spot! Friendly, accommodating staff and food is consistently good."}
{"text":"The slightly overpriced Mexican Benedict definitely fulfilled every tastebud craving. The portion was just right, and I ate it all without feeling overwhelmed afterwards. The service was good and the ambient was great!! Good music. Perfect decor. Quite satisfying."}
{"text":"Everything here was delicious. At first walking in, it was a bit confusing until we realized that it was a walk up counter ordering system but the food and the coffee was amazing. The staff was incredibly friendly as well. Can't wait to go back"}
{"text":"The bmoc was okay. The only good about this place is the smoked pork. Waffles were soaked in syrup so very sweet. The donut is the most failed part of this. Doesn't taste fresh. However the smoked pork was tender and juicy."}
{"text":"I really appreciate places like these, where they put a lot of thought and creativity in their foods. I wish I could give it a higher star rating, but I have to be honest. I tried it on two different occasions because I always want to give a place a review after at least visiting it twice. The food is well done and thought out, but maybe the execution is bad or they are trying to doing too much.   The first time actually was a while ago, since I am not usually at this area of town at all. I tried the BMOC which is their signature dish or most popular. While I admit it is very impressive looking, it is very difficult to eat. The pork chop is just so dominating and so salty, that it takes several tries until you can find a right balance. I understand what they are going for, since a lot of other places are always trying to balance this sweet-salty flavors. It is almost impossible to balance and sometimes it comes out bland, because the flavors don't compliment but cancels each other out. I do like complex flavors but I like consistent well define flavors where every bite is the same. It was kind of a let down  The second time, I tried the grillades, which is their take on biscuit and gravy. The beef was nice and tender small pieces, but the sauce was too spicy(heat wise). All I could taste was the heat, it again just dominated everything. I also think that everything is in the details in the dish, the biscuit was dry and chewy and had a weird artificial flavor to it. I had a side of potatoes which were done well , but was cold, I could not believe that they would do that at a place like this. This is a self serve type of place, so as far as service is concerned it is what you expect.   Lastly I really would have given this place a 2 star for its food, but I raised it to 3 star because they were trying to be different and the quality and thoughtfulness of the food is good, just  the execution does not work here."}
{"text":"No breakfast comes close to filling up my boyfriend then Vovomeena's BMOC. At around $10, how can one go wrong? A waffle, pork chop, 2 eggs, little cinnamon with apples and a Portuguese donut to top it all off. He can't wait to go back for seconds on Sunday. Order was called in and ready within mins. Workers were friendly and courteous, definitely a plus especially for such a busy place."}
{"text":"Came for the first time and brought 4 friends visiting from out-of-town.  Seating can get a little hairy; order at a counter and get a number and find a table.  Since we were a bigger party, someone helped us grab a table after a few minutes of waiting to the side.  I had the Mexican Benedict, which was delicious but with the sopes and spuds, was a little too much carb for me.  My iced latte with almond milk was perfect!   My friends had the bangers and the tortilla Espanola which they enjoyed as well.  My vegan friend was also able to find some options and they helped my friend with her two-year-old with an egg option on the side.  The service was prompt, even considering how busy they were at the time.  We all enjoyed brunch and i will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Service was excellent. Fast and efficient. We ordered the Mexican Benedict and the pain perdu. Mexican Benedict was delicious! The pain perdu was a little too sweet for breakfast but it was really good, tasted like my mom's capirotada!"}
{"text":"Just the eggs with potatoes, toast, and sausage were great, and I enjoyed the coffee too. Over easy eggs were cooked perfectly and who doesn't like Schreiner's sausage? The whole grain toast was hearty and came with nice butter and jam. The manager here is super nice and very accomodating. Well done guys!"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious food and great service! Very unique menu items and cool atmosphere."}
{"text":"B.M.O.C is just amazing!!! If I could, I would just order a dozen portugese doughnut"}
{"text":"I have been searching for a great little place that's not too out of the way to just sit and relax for quite some time now. Vovomeena is one of the best in Phoenix. Not to mention, the food and coffee were beyond ordinary. They were something to brag about.  The service was excellent and I am now going to be a regular here.  Perfect."}
{"text":"There food was delicious, try the banana french toast with whiskey caramel. It seems as if they are still getting organized, I'd love to try it again in a few weeks. I had to wait for coffee in the coffee line, was told to wait in the brunch line, and then move back over to the coffee line... Overall food was great!"}
{"text":"Went with 3 other people, once we figured out the ordering process, we were good.  Food was great, service was very friendly and professional, we will be back!"}
{"text":"Special of the day awesome. Will return food is amazing staff very friendly and fast service. Coffee is excellent No downside to this place. Worth the drive from. Scottsdale fo a wonderful breakfast."}
{"text":"Excellent and creative menu across the board.  Not epic or life-changing, and maybe not even indelibly memorable, but excellent.  4 stars!"}
{"text":"Quaint atmosphere, definitely a spot that you could easily pass up but after reviewing other Yelpers I'm glad that we stopped by. The food was fantastic with unique twists to some favorites. Space is limited inside so get there early otherwise they have a small dining section outside in the courtyard."}
{"text":"My husband and I ate breakfast here while visiting in Phoenix on Wednesday, May 18th. This place is so quaint. The menu is creative and interesting. We ordered a blackstone scramble, a pain perdu with two iced cold brew coffees. Our total was a little under $30 but it was worth every penny. The pork shoulder in the scramble was savory and the french toast was sweet so it was a perfect combination. The coffee was great to boot! We'll be back again."}
{"text":"This place is pretty good. Menu is not overwhelmingly complicated. Pretty tasty food, but the coffee is much better. If you are a fan of coffee, definitely the place to go."}
{"text":"Pros:  Goodfood and diversity on the menu.  Awesome space and great outside seating Parking is accessible  Service was nice GREAT MUSIC. Ha! 3/15/16 whoever made that playlist deserves a metal.  Cons: Weak coffee Small portions for price  The ordering system is annoying; you order at the counter like its a coffee joint and then get your own coffee refills, etc. I don't care to eat out for any meal besides breakfast and I guess I'm a bit of a diva because I love being served -- I recognize I am probably not the majority, but it's a con for me."}
{"text":"Amazing food but horribly cramped! Not enough place to eat comfortablly and would.not recommend big groups since it has no space. Food wise, amazing and perfect for a small date brunch!"}
{"text":"After an awesome lunch at Astor House, we took the recommendation from the owner to try out their new breakfast place, Vovomeena.  This is still new and has a few kinks to work out.  Overall, it's a great breakfast place.  The food is delicious and something different from your usual egg benedict and pancakes.  We got the boxty and grillades which was delicious.  It did take a while for us to get our food and the set up is a bit confusing.  It's counter service so you'll need to order first and then find a place to sit.  Also, if you order coffee, you need to go to the coffee counter to pick it up.  Once you get the hang of it, it's a pleasant brunch experience.  The Japanese coffee was good as well."}
{"text":"A great place for breakfast. Minus one star for the coffee not being that great. I had the johnnycakes, which were quite delicious and filling; a great way to start the day. The cappuccino I got was sub-par. Lots of natural light and you can sit outside too."}
{"text":"Really liked this place. Food was delicious and relatively quick even though it's super busy. I recommend getting the BMOC and/or Mexican Benedict.   Didn't get a chance to try their coffee but looks like they had some good options. Will have to try next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"I love this place. Extremely creative menu and quality filling food. The atmosphere is comfortable, light, and community oriented. Bring your appetite! The staff is wonderful!"}
{"text":"You will receive everything, expected. This establishment is warmly operated from beginning to end. Will return again and also bring extended family. These recipes are delicious to seasoned travelers and to eat at home families.The normal annoying pits of service found elsewhere are no where here!"}
{"text":"This place overall has a good vibe and the food is different but really good. It can be a little pricey but your paying for the quality of the food. As you wait in line you can watch them make fresh food from scratch. Recommend it if you're looking to try something new and open to modernized Mexican food."}
{"text":"Best breakfast in Downtown Phoenix and perhaps the World!!!! If you love someone bring them here."}
{"text":"The service is great! The sausage is excellent too!! If you're wheat/gluten intolerant or need gf then good luck. I had Johnnycakes since it was advertised as being made with corn: and wheat... grrr.    Walking into this chic locale was fun, and had enough different textures within to lure us in. We drove over 20 miles to specifically to eat here.  Coffee is excellent too and very unique: I love their variety of cold drips.   The big negative (or a positive spending on your perspective) is that this place is too NOISY! This is primarily why I am giving 3/5 stars. If it wasn't so stinking loud in here I would easily give 4-4.5 stars."}
{"text":"I'm from Rhode Island so the minute I saw the menu I started laughing. I also called my grandmother vovo - so I immediately felt like I had to try to this place. I mean, Portuguese donuts? Say no more. YUM! They have a delicious breakfast selection. I just had the coffee and a donut today - but we are going back this weekend for the breakfast. The staff is friendly and the decor is wicked awesome (Inside Rhodey joke). I just wish they served Portuguese linguisa sausage. :0)"}
{"text":"The food (johnny cakes and pain perdu) was good, and the service was exceptional. At least 4 times someone stopped by the table to see how our food was and if there was anything they could do for us. We were also asked how our meal was on the way out the door. The staff were really awesome!"}
{"text":"Wonderful breakfast place with delicious, unique dishes and great service. The savory crepes are amazing!!  I really can't say enough about them. The manager clearly cares about guests and makes sure they enjoy the meal. Good coffee, too!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and people. Smaller location so make sure you come early to get a good spot! Had the chorizo sopes which were a tad on the spicier side. Other than that great overall experience. Price was reasonable for downtown Phoenix."}
{"text":"Really good food and some unique choices. The place however is a tad too expensive in relation to portion size to be honest but I'm willing to pay a little more from time to time to enjoy the food here. Parking can be an issue since there are a ton of places around this place. If you are looking for something new and in the mood for brunch give the place a try."}
{"text":"Lucky to get in before the Easter (Sunday) crowd.   Amazing ambience delicious items. Very hard to decide on just one. There is a party going on in my mouth. Thank you Yelp for showing me this."}
{"text":"Super efficient counter service, friendly and helpful staff, and a unique delicious menu"}
{"text":"YUM YUM YUM!!!!!! Food is absolutely delicious! Its weird to figure the place out at first but the staff is great at walking you through it.   BRING CASH TO TIP."}
{"text":"A cute local breakfast/coffee place. I really enjoyed my Mexican Benedict. My kids gave two thumbs up for the 3 sisters omelette and the kids meal. You order at the counter and pay then take a number to your table. We got our food quickly which was good because we were hungry. Yum."}
{"text":"Start with their Coffee is amazing! We are visiting the area from Ventura CA an love to eat breakfast in an outdoor environment. This place has outdoor seating which is great. Service, nothing short of amazing! We ordered the scramble and the tortilla. The scramble with the homemade flour tortilla was fantastic! The Spanish Tortilla was just okay. Since we have been to Barcelona and my best friend is a Spaniard, I have had some amazing Tortilla. This one was not close. Sorry, but outside of the so-so Tortilla, everything else was excellent!!!"}
{"text":"Love the laid back chill decor.  Easy to order your food at the counter,  pick up your barista coffee, at the next counter, and help your self to refreshing lemon water.   I ordered the Mexican benedicts.  They were served over a sope, which is a thick round mini tortilla.  Gluten free of course.  There was chorizo in the sope and the perfectly Poached egg on top with a light hollandaise sauce.    Delicious!"}
{"text":"I may never eat Breakfast again, I think I am still full.  This place is owned by the same people who own Tuck Shop- Maybe my favorite restaurant in Phoenix.  The place is smallish- but cool.  Tables can be hard to come by, but if 2 people are sitting at a 4 top, ask them nicely, and they will switch to your 2 top.  It is worth the wait, because the food and coffee are awesome.  I had the BMOC, it was perfection on a plate- sweet, smoky, salty, runny, savory.  It was also about 2000 calories, but it was worth every bite!  I also did not eat again for 10 hours.  I ordered just coffee, it was good stuff.  My girlfriend got a Caramel something or other- she really liked it.  I'll be back."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely amazing! A girlfriend of mine mentioned we try it out a few months ago and now we cannot get enough of it. The food is organic, fresh, and just simply delicious!! If you go on a weekend get there early! It is a smaller space and fills up fast. The staff is amazing and super nice! I just wish they were open on mondays....my day off"}
{"text":"Went this morning took my mother, we were on a search for a great breakfast near the downtown area. This place didn't disappoint. Great service and awesome menu and coffee! We got the Cinnamon apple French toast with marscapone cheese and the Tortilla Espanola. Amazing!"}
{"text":"We are in town for spring training and this morning I was looking for a nice breakfast spot. I actually found Vovomeena mentioned in an online article listing the five best breakfast spots in Phoenix. We drove up and found quick parking and noticed that they were a fast casual restaurant in that you line up, order at the counter and seat yourself with a number to wait for your food to come out. This actually works very well for this restaurant in that they have a fairly small but eclectic menu (no substitutions please). We got there right in time as we only had one couple ahead of us in line and as we waited I saw an order of their biscuits and gravy get served up. My mind was made up, biscuits it would be. I chased it with their Japanese style ice coffee. The food came out quickly and it was delicious. The gravy had a rich peppery taste to it complimented by the big chunks of sausage generously smothered over a delicious split biscuit. As we ate the line at the counter grew to extend itself out the door. Now for those of you thinking that fast casual means little to no service, Vovomeena will prove you wrong. The food was brought out by a friendly food runner and as we were wrapping up our meal, I believe it was the manger, stopped by to ask us about our experience and chatted with us a while, answering my question about the name of the place. Meena being the nickname of the owners grandmother and Vovo being short for grandmother in Portuguese. It was an awesome breakfast and I would highly recommend it."}
{"text":"The breakfast was great, good quality and quantity of food, relaxing atmosphere. The ice coffee was perfect for this hot morning."}
{"text":"all I can say is wow the minions different from anywhere you can go things that you rarely see like my tortilla Espanola it's kind of like a egg casserole with tortillas very creamy text sugar tortillas perfect like the fact that they give you a greens with a light acidic dressing and balances out the eggs since I don't eat pork this is one of those very few places that has chicken as an option or any non pork meat would recommend getting this download waffle on the other hand was just one step above Eggo waffle very Bland very soft not too good another one of those places you get really good food that you order at the counter no tipping required so I could save money for more delicious food can't beat that I think next time I'm going to try the French toast saw them making it look very good will be back very soon"}
{"text":"I've been here twice so far and both times have left stuffed and happy with the food and service. I've tried the Mexican Benedict and the special of that day, the huevos rancheros. Both were so flavorful, and those potatoes complete the meal. I've only tried the regular brew coffee, which is also very good. My friend ordered a cappuccino that was just about the frothiest coffee I have ever seen! I like that you can order your food and pay before being seated, and I appreciate the little coffee bar to the side where regular brew coffee is self-serve or they make specialty/espresso drinks to order. Staff is also very friendly and accommodating."}
{"text":"This is definitely a go-to when in Phx! The ambiance is great, I love the coffee bar they have. They have food for those that like to try new things and for those who just want good simple breakfast! The place is clean, refreshing, and the staff is friendly."}
{"text":"Mexican Benedict was delicious!! The orange juice is fresh! The place was clean and music was nice!"}
{"text":"The Service, Atmosphere and Breakfast - all top notch! I had the Orchard French Toast with brekafast potatoes and it was delicious. All the flavors melted together on the french toast and the potatoes were crispy and soft, just how i like them. I held out to eat here on my 4 hour drive from California and I am so glad I did. Breakfast Heaven!"}
{"text":"Yummy breakfast that is quicker than most sit down places. You walk in and the place is bustling on a weekday. I had the chorizo Benedict and it was good. Everyone else in my group enjoyed their breakfast and were all satisfied with the speed and quality. Will be back when in the Phoenix area"}
{"text":"After a few years of service, they definitely got the ordering and table seating down pat!  Don't worry if you see a line and zero empty tables.  You WILL get a table, just line up by the coffee area and the manager, who has been there forever, will seat you well before the meal. Do not try and steal a table, they will catch you!   I ordered the Three Sisters Omelet and my DH ordered the pork chop with Portugese donut.  Everything was very tasty, with the exception of the side of bacon.  One piece was fairly crispy and the other very limp and fatty."}
{"text":"This place was busy but we were able to get a table.  The food was delicious and everyone was very nice.  The pork chop and waffle was amazing!!!"}
{"text":"I came here for brunch and tried their biscuits and gravy, Mexican Benedict and their banana french toast. I was really excited for their biscuits and gravy, but it was just okay. I liked their sausage gravy but it wasn't as flavorful as I expected it to be. Their Mexican Benedict was just okay as well. Their french toast was pretty good, but very sweet. If you like banana bread, you'll probably like this dish."}
{"text":"Was in town for Spring Training and was downtown to eat at another establishment recommended. The other establishment had a long line so we searched Yelp and found Vovomeena. Their menu is outstanding!  In fact we came two days in a row. Had the Mexican Benedict the first day and the Biscuits & Gravy the next. Great flavor!  My son had the B.M.O.C. which is a pork chop on a waffle with two eggs on top. I tried the pork chop and it was tender and had a great smoky taste to it. Would recommend this place to anyone traveling to or through Phoenix!"}
{"text":"really good it would have been 5 stars if they had food for a person who doesn't eat pork or eggs lol. yet their one vegan option was good."}
{"text":"Been here 3 times and the food is amazing the 3 sisters omlet is super fantastic and the bacon is the bomb! great americano / coffee beans too! This by far is my favorite breakfast spot, place is busy on the weekend but with food like this I understand why. It's why I come during the week! Lol"}
{"text":"I was a little thrown by the bleh strip mall location at first... but then, that's pretty normal for Phoenix overall I guess.  The place is set back into a little courtyard, so the outside seating is pretty relaxed with no cars whizzing by or anything.  This is a popular place, for sure - for good reason.  So prepare for a wait.  It's the type of place where you walk in, grab a menu, and stand in line to order - then they bring you the food after you order.  I've always been a fan of that style, so when you're done eating, you just leave, but it took so long that I was wishing I could just relax at a table instead of standing in line for over 30 minutes, but whatever.  I loved the menu.  Short but sweet with creative breakfast options.  So many things I wanted to try.  I loved the biscuits and gravy.  Coffee was meh - made in mass quantity instead of to order.  My girlfriend liked her breakfast, but didn't love it.  We'll be back..."}
{"text":"When a midweek brunch can bring back fond nostalgia of flavors from a childhood you never had, it's a big win. First, let's talk Mornin' Moonshine, shall we? Truly a stellar coffee product that is created with care and precision that you can taste. It's as artful as it is delicious.   I knew it was more than I could eat, but I had to order the b.m.o.c., which is a waffle topped with a pork chop and eggs. This dish is also garnished with a Portuguese donut. My husband ordered the savory crepes, which were topped with a red pepper sauce that replaces ketchup in my book.   Truly satisfying, tasty and the service was top-notch despite the order-at-the-counter-and-pick-a-seat setup."}
{"text":"OMG, for sure, a MUST do for breakfast.  The Banana Bread French Toast was amazing, especially with the Caramel Whiskey sauce!  GREAT atmosphere, good service, yummy food.  I will be bringing friends! Thx"}
{"text":"Me and my husband went on a Saturday morning around 930ish AM and it was little busy. From outside, it is a pretty small place, walking in one can smell the wonderful aromas coming from the restaurant, they have small outdoor seating here, not good for summer months with the way temperature has been, there is no mist or fans out there. Upon entering the restaurant, there is a sign to take the menu and order and manager will seat you. We ordered the special for that day, which was Steak Rancheros. My husband loved the special, for me not so much. The salsa on the steak was very good. Their coffee was great. Their servers were really good and polite. The man at the register was very impatient and just wanted to be done and move on to next person. We told him that this was our first time coming, what do you recommend, he did not have anything to say. So we asked him again, what do you think about the special? he said- \"it's good!\". That is how we made our choice, we did not want to hold the line. My husband ordered Orange juice, which is nothing spectacular, it has the taste of a regular grocery store juice. I ordered waffle as extra and it was okay. When it came, it looked like it was already sitting for a while. I have posted the same pics with and without flash. They do not have much sitting area inside, their high tables and chairs are very uncomfortable to sit in. I am not sure what all the hype is about, or may we just ended up coming on the wrong day. I have no desire to go out of my way to visit this place again."}
{"text":"Great little breakfast/brunch place with cool chairs and ropes hanging from the ceilings.  We got the Pain Perdu with sausage and a coconut macaroon.  I thought the main dish was a bit too thick and heavy, though my girlfriend liked it.  Neither of us thought much of the sausages. The macaroon was fine, but felt a bit under-cooked."}
{"text":"Busy little brunch place in Central Phoenix.  Portions are HUGE.  Great food and coffee!  Will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"I ordered the blackstone scramble and my brother ordered the pain Peru. The blackstone was good but the tortilla was dry and crackly. Potatoes were cool and tasted like they were cooked hours before we got there and were just barely warmed up for us. Coffee was meh and so was the tea."}
{"text":"This is our favorite neighborhood restaurant! We come here far too often. The service has always been personable and the food is always a great way to wake up!"}
{"text":"GREAT spot for breakfast and coffee! WE decided to try something new in the area, and Vovomeena is about the only place we haven't tried yet. I'm SUPER glad we tried it, as we'll probably be back this coming weekend. The menu is very simple, straight forward and to the point. they have close to 10 different menu items, a mix of omelettes, meats and breakfast dishes. I went with the Biscuits and Gravy with over easy eggs and a Vanilla latte. Wifey had this omellette with feta and a ton of veggies. My daughter went with the kids pancake and eggs, HUGE pancake that was easily enough for her to share with her daddy haha The sausage gravy was the perfect consistency, and the biscuits were done just right. Wifey LOVED her omelette as well. Teh coffee was also done just perfect. All in all, just a great meal at a cool little spot. we'll for sure be back!"}
{"text":"Ate here yesterday with a friend for breakfast.  They had good friendly service and the food was very good also. I tried the Mexican Benedict and was impressed, It was original and had good flavor. My friend and I both really liked the potatoes they serve here, they were really good.  They serve a very good cup of coffee as well. Parking can be annoying in this location but I went at an off time so I got a good space without any problems. It can be crowded at the rush times as there are many places right together.   Overall I was very impressed and want to go back and try some of the other items on the menu."}
{"text":"We've become regulars and love it here :) Always consistent with food quality and service. Coffee is delish. Great brunch spot"}
{"text":"Big portions.   Enough to share.   Unique taste combinations.   BMOC was tender and the waffle was great.   I liked how you order and pay self serve beverages.     Will come back to try different dishes"}
{"text":"Such a beautiful place. I feel like family when I walk in! Mexican Benedict-- ridiculously good. My girlfriend and I usually split that & the savory crepes. So delicious, & consistently executed!"}
{"text":"The food hasn't been very impressive. However, they have the most amazing cold brew which you can get a \"jug of\" for $12 or so and fills up 4 full glasses of cold brew. They have a walk up and order line, and from there you are seated and your food comes within 10 min- which is SO refreshing for a breakfast place, which can sometimes take 2 hours to get through. That said, 4stars!"}
{"text":"Although the menu is relatively limited, there were a variety of food options for me, being vegetarian. The atmosphere is great and the weather was nice enough for me to sit outside at the community style table. The food was made so quickly and with great quality. My only debacle was the request to not modify menu items when ordering."}
{"text":"Food was pretty good. They didnt have alot of variety and they also dont allow substitutions so that was a bummer. Kind of pricey for not really having that much variety but staff is super friendly and nice which is cool."}
{"text":"Cool little restaurant. Parking is tight but free which is nice. My husband loved his cold brew coffee and I had the refreshing passion fruit iced tea. The biscuits and gravy are hearty and filling, the tortilla was nice and light yet incredibly savory. Knocked a star after watching a cook rub his nose with a gloved hand and keep working. That's pretty hard to shake as you're already finished up."}
{"text":"I really dig this place! There's plant of outdoor seating, the Mexican Benedict was delicious, the coffee is delicious and they have honey and almond milk sitting out. I like those subtle touches of class."}
{"text":"The only reason this place received 4 stars instead of 5 is because there are no substitutions. As someone that doesn't prefer to eat meat but loves eggs Benedict I was sad to hear they don't make the meals on site thus can't manipulate them.   But their coffee is amazing and the food is delicious!"}
{"text":"I like the vibe here, and I've found the staff responsive and friendly. The menu is sort of a mixed bag: unusual combinations, some of which really work and others that really don't.  The main thing that keeps me from going back more often is that the food is generally very heavy, and the menu doesn't have the flexibility one usually expects with breakfast. For instance, you can get bangers in the one dish that features them, but not as an option in place of the breakfast links that come with one or two other dishes. No building your own breakfast here. The menu hasn't changed in the few years since they opened, so things are pretty much set in stone."}
{"text":"If I could give this place 10 stars I would! My husband and I shared the Orchard French toast and the Wilcox Avenue. Both were out of this world.  I am from Rhode Island and I loved seeing the menu offerings named for things from back home like Blackstone, Three Sisters, Pawtucket, and Johnny cakes.  We sat outside to enjoy our breakfast which was a great start to a beautiful day.  This place is just great and you must try it out ASAP!"}
{"text":"In Phoenix for some baseball Spring Training. Craving a good breakfast on our way to the game. Holy smokes! Our craves are satisfied beyond our wildest expectations. Excellent breakfast sandwich. Excellent scrambled eggs with onions, peppers and pork. We ordered a pancake style dish that has corn in it - terrific and original.  Excellent customer service. Wonderful coffee. Nice people. So awesome."}
{"text":"Very yummy breakfast...love the atmosphere and the location. I'll stop by next time I'm in the area."}
{"text":"It's been a while since my visit here but it still stands out as a sweet brunch spot. Walk up and order kind of place. There was a long line but it went quickly. My group had the bangers and mash, biscuits and gravy, omelette, and French toast. For whatever reason the toast came out cold and the staff was happy to fix it for us. He even comped it. Really good gesture. They featured coffee from somewhere in phoenix locally but I don't remember the name. Anyhow, I'm definitely hoping to try this place again."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to check out Vovomeena for a while, so when my mom and I found ourselves in the neighborhood, we stopped in for Sunday brunch. We both got the basic Wilcox Avenue which came with eggs, toast, potatoes, and bacon or sausage. I got the bacon and my mom had the sausage. We both agreed the potatoes were awesome. I liked the bacon and tried some of my mom's sausage. It was the real, fresh kind of sausage and cooked perfectly. The best part is they have a cute patio area they share with the other restaurants in the section. Made for a cute and relaxing dining experience! Service was good though they did run out of the Sunday special, chicken and waffles."}
{"text":"I ordered the Mexican eggs benedict and it was decent. The sopes which replaced the traditional English breakfast muffin were kind of tough and super dense. Maybe they were just overlooked. The chorizo filling was ok, with a bit of a kick in spice. The eggs were poached just fine, but they apparently didn't drain them enough before they were placed on top because there was water on top of the chorizo that spilled out when I cut into the egg benedict. The one redeeming point was the iced cold brew coffee. It was very smooth."}
{"text":"We have become brunch lovers so it was exciting to see unique menu options at Vovomeena. The have a convenient setup so when patrons get there, they can get in line and order prior to being seated. While it's not the biggest restaurant, we were able to order & get seated immediately at one of the tables outside. Our food came out in just a short while.  I chose the 3 Sisters Omelette & my husband chose the Banging Pocket. It was nice that multiple menu options were served with your choice of bacon, sausage, or potatoes. When we were in line, we had the full view of the kitchen; I had seen them cooking up potatoes and they looked delicious so I got those as my side with the Omelette!  My husband loved the Banging Pocket which came with the potatoes. It was a pretty sizeable breakfast but he was able to eat the whole thing. The Omelette was tasty with the black beans, corn, zucchini, & cheese. The only thing I wasn't a huge fan of was the feta that was on top. It felt like there was too much & the strong flavor of the cheese overpowered the others flavors. The Banging Pocket came with a side of salsa which I actually think would've gone well with the omelette as well. I'd ask for that next time ... and no feta!  If I were looking for something different, I'd come back to Vovomeena. It probably wouldn't be my #1 choice but there are other options they offer which I'd like to try!"}
{"text":"Amazing food and atmosphere with a friendly staff. A little small on the inside but it's still really cute."}
{"text":"Delicious food!! Get ready to wait for it but definitely worth the wait. Johnny cakes are amazing!! Try the pork sausage as well."}
{"text":"A new favorite for us foodies! We are always on the look out for new and different and Vovomeena delivered! Between the Mexican Benedict and the B.M.O.C my BF and I were beyond satisfied. The Japanese cold brewed coffee was spectacular....try the lemon jalapeño and the green tea mint flavors, you won't be disappointed"}
{"text":"Lovely place. Can't tell how busy the place is from outside but once you get in, you'll be amazed by the decors and vibe. Friendly staff and good service, and the food was uniquely flavored with a Mexican twist. Recommend the three sisters omelet with potatoes!  Ps they have a parking lot and patio seating."}
{"text":"Really nice cafe for brunch. There's ample seating inside and outside the cafe. However, you have to go up to the counter yourself to order and pay. Everything on the menu looked delicious so it took me a while to pick what I wanted! The price isn't bad and the portion is pretty big. I wasn't able to finish my food haha"}
{"text":"I just passed through Phoenix on a road trip with a friend and we stopped here for brunch. I had a banana bread French toast dish with whiskey caramel, it was delicious (though overly sweet). Their bacon was another big up. My friend got the pork chop, I tried a bit and it was excellent. I'll definitely come again if I ever pass through.  Edit: Came through a second time and got a black bean and corn egg casserole (three sisters I think). I was equally impressed this time around, though it seemed that the bacon was not the same as what they used the last time. While the bacon wasn't quite as amazing as the last time, it was still perfectly cooked."}
{"text":"I was here on labor day and it was a bit busy, i ate a delicious chorizo burrito. The coffee was also good. I recommend vovomeena."}
{"text":"I've had the Mexican Benedict and the Pain Perdu both were excellent. The atmosphere is really cute and chill. I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Amazing breakfast, lovely people, and perfect iced coffee! I (heart) you, Vovomeena!"}
{"text":"I work at the Zoyo next door to Vovomeena - Today was my first time ordering from them. I truly had a wonderful breakfast, I ordered the Wilcox Avenue which is a traditional breakfast - i wanted to play it safe.. lol And it was amazing. as i was waiting for my food i saw a few other dishes that looked amazing. The menu is small yet the options have so many items it seems bigger. The best part is the coffee bar which is all \"locally crafted\" as it states on their menu. They can make u just about anything!! Ben the Barista was a super sweet guy and gave great service!! The decor is beautiful. Check it out!! u will not be disappointed!!"}
{"text":"Friendly people, neat vibe, great food. Super breakfast experience. I had the banana bread French toast."}
{"text":"This place is really good and different at the same time. I'm not from the area but if I was I would definitely be a regular"}
{"text":"Great place for breakfast. Everything I've ever had here is good. My favorite is the Mexican Benedict. The corned-beef hash special today was wonderful. You order at the counter, get a number, and the food is delivered, always quickly, to your table. The small kitchen is extremely efficient, and the front-house workers, including the owner, are very friendly and helpful. The restaurant also houses a small coffee stand with excellent cold-brew percolating through giant glass beakers overhead."}
{"text":"Wow, this place was amazing. I'm really glad that we decided to pick this place.   When you first come in, you order at the register. If you get a drink, you wait at the drink bar. To assist in finding a seat, a manager is there after you put in your order. I decided to get the classic egg sandwich and Japanese cold brew. I highly recommend the cold brew. It's so good and strong! The classic egg sandwich was amazing too. It's on an egg bun, my fave. The chipotle aioli goes so well with everything on that sandwich. The potatoes on the side were perfectly crispy. Everything was just amazing. The service was great and they kept checking to make sure everything was okay.  If I ever go back to Phoenix, I'd definitely go back here!"}
{"text":"Came here for a lunch meeting. Pretty close to downtown and my office, wasn't too difficult to find. The parking here though is a bit hard to find - you may end up needing to park next door. I had to park in Zoe's kitchen because parking lot was full.   I ordered the tortilla espanola with the sausage. The food arrived pretty fast! The tortilla espanola was interesting - first time having it. It had a soft spongy texture - looked like savory cake! The sausage was good, and the salad that came with it was a little greasy for me. Not sure what they put on it but overall the entire dish was good.   Definitely recommend for brunch in youre in the area!"}
{"text":"Our family loves to have our Sunday breakfast here. Classic cafe style, with excellent food and coffee is superb. Any option on the menu I've chosen has been delicious!"}
{"text":"Can my review consist only of row after row of heart emojis?  No? Darn. Alright then.  Oh Vovomeena. I came for the coffee, I stayed for the breakfast. I saw the cold brew flights on yelp so this easily became a weekend destination. Unfortunately I work most weekend mornings but finally had the opportunity to stop by this previous weekend.  I ordered the waffle with bacon and potatoes. You have NO idea how happy I am that there is a place that offers a breakfast dish with no eggs. I'm not the biggest breakfast fan (because I despise eggs), and unless you feel the same way you don't realize how they are in just about every breakfast dish. Aaaannnyyyyyway, my waffle was awesome (with strawberry jam because I can't stand maple syrup either) and my bacon and potatoes were good too. Got a Portugese donut, because duh, and I was super full after that.  My cold brew flight was good. They use Roastery of Cave Creek coffee which is excellent coffee. This flight consisted of the Black & Tan (a Roc2 roast), vanilla coco-something (vanilla bean and cocoa nibs), and lemon jalapeño. The first two, yes. The last one....not for me. We chatted with the barista when we were leaving about the brewing system they use, as well as espresso drinks. He was very knowledgable and came across somewhat passionate about coffee.  The only downside was that on a Saturday morning, it was a little difficult to relax while eating. It gets pretty crowded and they are quick to clear your table after you have taken your last bite. Service is quick though, and we had no issue getting a table.  We'll be back, for sure."}
{"text":"This is closer to a 3.5 review but I can't quite nudge it up to a 4.  First off, the food is really good.  We had a Benedict and Johnny Cakes.  Both were tasty,a s was the coffee.  The menu was diverse and interesting and the food arrived quickly.  We were lucky enough to share a table  with some friendly people .  The place was packed, with people walking back and forth looking for seating.   Now for the stuff that needs improvement:  I am not a fan of the stand-in,-line, serve-yourself format in small spaces.  The coffee stand is awkwardly placed and, combined with the lack of seating, makes for a lot of unnecessary congestion.  I get the need to turn tables quickly but would like to be able to linger over a cup of coffee, especially at these prices.  I wish you well , Vovomeena, and know that you have a lot of fans.  I may try you again on a weekday but you're a little too claustrophobic and hectic for me on the weekends.."}
{"text":"Came here with a group of 4 for breakfast. The most popular items were the biscuits and gravy, 3 sisters omelet, and Mexican Benedict. The banger pocket was just ok. Good outdoor seating and unlimited coffee!"}
{"text":"Always fast a friendly. The bangin pocket and tortilla espanola are amazing! The patio is nice for kids!"}
{"text":"Yes its a hipster place, but the food is fantastic!  You all know I love my Biscuits & Gravy, this place gets it right! Homemade gravy with chunks; Chunks People! Not that doctored up stuff from the can that other places like to pass as \"homemade!\", nicely poached eggs and fluffy biscuits! The coffee was great, service was good, the only complaint I have was the food was not that hot.  Grab a menu at the end of the rope wall and pick your passion by ordering at the counter. Fast and friendly service is waiting for you here so check them out!  Second time I had the Banging Pocket and it was a flavor explosion (does all that sound right?)! Piping hot and a nice fluffy pita, can't beat this thing, I was full half way through, but kept on eating.  Check this place out for sure as its a hidden gem in Phoenix!!"}
{"text":"This is a good spot. Very tasty breakfasts. The guys at the counter is alway very nice to me and is very informative about the menu selections.  Speaking of the menu. The food here alone would have gotten this review 5 stars. This menu is a mixture of southwestern Midwestern American classics. I give the food 6 stars.   The problem is signage. You have no idea where to end and where to begin in there. Am I supposed to order coffee here? My meal here? I'm confused. The process  layout gets 2 stars.   Overall this is a quality restaurant."}
{"text":"This is what downtown has been missing. A quaint, reasonably priced, good energy place that is all inviting.   This place is just plain good. Great food, great service, great atmosphere, great time!   And they have tabasco sauce!! So many breakfast places now don't have tabasco sauce. The young girl who served me said \"thats all we have...\".   I'm hooked. I'll be bringing people to eat here.   Impressive joint."}
{"text":"The manager Kai was amazing, made sure we enjoyed are breakfast and the staff is friendly. The food was great and the bacon was delightful!!"}
{"text":"Great concept in downtown phoenix. They have a separate coffee bar for people who want to order and run. The dining room is open and airy. The food was top notch, home-style cooking. I will return."}
{"text":"I have mixed feelings about this place. My companion ordered some sort of a chorizo-heavy situation that was pretty tasty; I, however, went with the mexican benedict because I'm a sucker for poached eggs. Well, the eggs were poached pretty solid, and I discovered that chorizo is not a meat I want in my benedict, so I did not eat much of my dish (stole a lot of my friend's, though!)."}
{"text":"My favorite meal of the day is breakfast.   Today was my first time at Vovomeena and I was so impressed. The entire experience was amazing!  The atmosphere is just great. Very chic ambiance, nice art, wood detail on the wall....Loved it.   The service was great as well. Everyone was really nice and helpful.   The food, I must say was my favorite part. I had Savory Crapes and I will dream about them tonight. They were amazing. My boyfriend had BMOC and he was really happy with his order as well.   This place is just one more reason for me to love breakfast even more so.   I am so glad we found this place and mostly glad we live in the coolest part of Phoenix that is full of cool new local places like this one.   Thanks Vovomeena and thank you Mid/Central Phoenix!"}
{"text":"I have heard great things about this place. My husband and daughter had the waffle and pancake, respectively. Both of them loved their meals. I tasted the pancake, and it was light, fluffy and delicious! I had the biscuits and gravy, which I did not enjoy. The biscuits were flat and dense, and I had a hard time cutting it with a fork. The gravy was okay, not bad, but not wonderful. I will definitely give this place another try, I'll just choose a different item next time."}
{"text":"Went in for some breakfast.  I ordered their Pain Purdu which was amazing.  The carmel whiskey sauce was good and not overly sweet.  The staff was very friendly and the place has a great look.  Nice to have a good breakfast place close to home.  Definitly want to try something else off their menu."}
{"text":"This is my favorite breakfast place in Phoenix. It's never empty and even on busy days the line moves along quickly. I always leave satisfied but never feeling \"heavy\" if that makes sense and The coffee is awesome"}
{"text":"Amazing place we first saw on Check Please.  Went here with my wife for a surprise pre-Valentine Day brunch.  We got a jug of the Morning Moonshine which gave us enough to take home and get a few more servings out of it.  If you like coffee, you must get.  My wife had the 3 Sisters omelet which she totally loved.  I had the Pain Perdu, which...I'm not even sure if I can describe right.  If you don't like sweet things, avoid.  But me, I'm all about it.  But it's literally Banana Bread Pudding as the bread for the French toast (I thought it'd just be a flavoring :) )  And we got the Portugese donuts because of course we did.  Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"The creeps are light and fluffy and the Mexican Benedict were amazing. Not to mention the coffee is so good. The cold press coffee is so amazing will def be back"}
{"text":"I saw the yelp photos of the Banana Bread Pudding French Toast, which made the decision to visit. But they didn't have those at the time, so I ate the Mexican Benedict which was delicious! My girlfriend ate the apple French Toast, and loved it. Quality craft food with a nice comfortable, urban farmhouse design. I normally drink coffee with creamer, but the Japanese cold brew was so tasty it didn't need anything else. Menu is short and to the point, not overloading with options."}
{"text":"I ordered the savory crepes and a latte and I was so impressed. The portions were great, the food was elegant and delicious, the staff was kind and attentive, and the atmosphere was relaxing. Will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"We had the Tortilla Espanola and it was delicious! Recommend getting it with the pork sausage. Staff was very friendly and attentive; restaurant has a relaxed atmosphere. Coffee was great! Would definitely return."}
{"text":"Unique food option. Kind of expensive and I wouldn't consider these healthy food options but it sure was delicious. They also have cold press coffee that is really good."}
{"text":"Vovomeena is located on the SE corner of 7th Ave and McDowell in the same center as how you roll sushi.  The place is very small and has a patio with a few tables as well.  The inside is modern and hipsterishly decorated.  You order at the counter and take a number and have a seat.  You can see the two cooks at the counter in the tiny kitchen preparing your food.  What was awkward was the barista is also the server.  So I found myself waiting for my drink while she was running around serving and bussing tables.  This place was packed so there is no reason they can't hire someone else to serve and bus tables.  Unless that person called out this is something that should be addressed.  I ordered the Mexican Benedict.  My dish was a pair of sopes with chorizo and poached eggs on top with hollandaise.  Along with country potatoes on the side.  The sope tasted store bought, the chorizo was okay but a bit greasy.  It also didn't taste homemade.  The eggs were both overcooked.  Poached eggs are by definition runny.  These egg yokes were rock solid.  The potatoes tasted good but were cold and needed lots of hot sauce.  My wife ordered the tortilla espanola with a green salad.  I literally had to laugh because the green salad was just plain arugula tossed with a vinagerette dressing.  The Spanish omelet was basically a slice of a fritatta that consisted of egg and potatos on top of a red salsa.  It was all very plain and simple but not in a way that showcased the ingredients.  The highlight of both our meals was definitely the bacon.  It was nicely smoked and tasted delicious.  If I had to guess it was bought from Schreiners  The meal was about 25 bucks with a tip.  I personally won't recommend this place and wouldn't drive across town to try it again.  I feel confident after the two meals I've tried there is not much else more to offer.  Very hip, very trendy, tad over priced, and poorly executed on several levels.  I will give them the benefit of the doubt and three stars but I would strongly suggest you temper your expectations."}
{"text":"I've been twice and the food is very good. The service is excellent as well. The atmosphere is nice inside. It's busy and there's a lot of bustling around, but I like that.  I got the Mexican Benedict the first time and biscuits and gravy the second time. I enjoyed both items very much.  If you like cold brew I recommend the cold brew sampler. Nice addition to a nice breakfast   Just keep in mind the prices are a little more than most breakfast places. The quality is worth it in my opinion."}
{"text":"Everything I've eaten here is a mouth orgasm, so whatever you're pondering, just do it. The coffee is great and the man-staff is hunky."}
{"text":"It's always a good sign when you want to order everything on the menu...  I was a little annoyed at first for having to wait in line to order, but once I got the menu, I was thankful for the extra time to decide what I wanted (I needed it).   b.m.o.c.: honestly, I don't even like pork or pork chops, but this sounded worthwhile and I'm really glad I went with it. the porkchop was delicious af and went super well with the waffle and poached eggs. It was kind of like an eggs benedict but with a better quality meat and carb substitute. They could probably top it with hollandaise and make it work tbh. I want it again...and again...  orchard french toast: challah? a million times yes. and the grated apple? actually might be the best french toast dish I've ever had. I'm surprised I finished 80% of both of these plates tbh. I was full the rest of the day.  cold brew flight: I learned afterwards you can actually pick which coffee options you want, which I wish I had known beforehand. everything I got was still good but also all kind of tasted more or less the same. I wish I could go back already and try the other options!  my favorite thing about this place was actually the decor. everything is super cute and photo-worthy. I love the signage and the coffee lab wall art. even the framed art prints in the bathroom were adorable.   congrats on winning brunch."}
{"text":"This is an update to my pervious review, I got a pm from the manager stating that they did have the mexican benedict but their warmer was out (idk what that means), it's even more disappointing that they did have it and refused to serve it, i don't get to downtown phoenix often and made a trip just to try this place, so disappointing"}
{"text":"Grab a menu and stand in line to order. After you order you can take a seat & they'll bring your food to you. Cute spot to have coffee, breakfast or brunch.  I'm not a huge coffee drinker, but I liked their little coffee bar. It looked like a nice selection.   The menu looked good, and I ordered a potato omelette it comes with your choice of sausage, or bacon I chose sausage. I wish the meal would've been good, but it was bland.   Parking is either right off McDowell which is behind the building, or you can park on the other side off 7th Ave.   They have patio seating, or indoor. They close early afternoon so make sure & check hours.   I may try it out again & order something sweet next time. Enjoy the pics"}
{"text":"Went here yesterday for breakfast. I got the b.m.o.c. As a recommendation along with a caffe latte and a cinnamon roll. The b.m.o.c. Was a good combination with he sweet component balancing out the savory. The pork shoulder was a little bit salty for my taste and the eggs were prepared well. The coffee was pretty good as well (I like a place that serves latte art :) ). The service was phenomenal. The employees were super prompt and polite and definitely friendly. Overall I would return to try out other menu items :)"}
{"text":"I can't believe this place serves tortilla espanola! Its one of my favorite dishes from traveling in Spain but it's too simple for American dining (just eggs and potato). Served along side an arugala salad and their homemade papas bravas sauce (not actual papas bravas sauce but a tasty slightly spicy tomato sauce). It was a fabulous find on my vacation,  wish I could eat here more than once."}
{"text":"This is a great little hide away for a wonderful breakfast. Service is amazing and everything is served very fresh. Kaj is a very engaged manager and the rest of the staff are equally as engaged making sure their product is served at perfection. 5 stars is not high enough for this place"}
{"text":"My sister and I decided to grab breakfast together today since I had taken the morning off work for our grandmother's burial. This place was bookmarked a while ago and it has 4.5 stars so we decided to give it a try.   The place was a bit hidden for us since we didn't see it from the street. Parking seems to be limited but we didn't have trouble getting a spot.   It's a quick place for breakfast/brunch. You order at the counter, get a number display and you grab a table. I went with the Savory Crepes - they were just okay. Nothing stood out and I wished I had ordered the orchard french toast that I was eyeballin on the menu. It wasn't that it was bad, it was just so plain. Maybe it was my sweet tooth that made me feel guilty.  My sister went with the banging pocket (I think that was what it was called). She said it was enjoyable but also was not impressed. She did enjoy the fresh squeezed orange juice and I managed to steal a few sips of it. Not a bad way to start a Friday after a funeral service. No complaints about the food and service was quick & friendly."}
{"text":"It has been way too long since I've been impressed by a meal at a restaurant. It seems that lately if I go out to eat I leave feeling unsatisfied and that I could have made the food better, quicker and for way less cash myself than what I just experienced dining out. Enter Vovomeena!   This place knocked my socks off! Wow! Great atmosphere, good music, friendly staff and the place is so clean and comfortable (even the bathrooms here are relaxing and beautiful). And talk about the menu! Johnnycakes oh my! Corn and chili pancakes with prickly pear maple syrup- what?!!! DELICIOUS! And the coffee from Morning Moonshine, a roaster I'll admit I'd never heard of before but am SO glad I've discovered! That's coming from a Portland, Oregon food capital foodie but thank goodness my mom lives in Phoenix and I can count on visiting Vovomeena each time I'm in town. Granted I have only tried the breakfast here (after all it is the best meal of the day is it not?) but I'm certain if you chose anything from the menu it would not disappoint. I highly recommend grabbing a meal and cup of joe here."}
{"text":"Was in the area and decided to give this place a try. Parking was a bit of a pain as there is shared parking with other franchise food joints such as chipotle, Pokie and so forth. There isn't a waiter but a nice gentleman walks around making sure all is well. Basically, walk in, order your food and have a seat. They bring the food to your table which was nice. This is more of a cafe spot but very urban and comfortable feel to it. Very modern with some chic added if that makes any sense. Any-who. Perfect place for brunch date with some girlfriends or partner. Food was tasty as i ordered the Mexican Benedict because this is Sonoran dessert and why not order Mexican right. Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"It was ok nothing special. Mine was rather bland (tortilla espanola). Coffee was a little strong for my likening as well.   It was new to try however. The process of ordering I have never done."}
{"text":"This place rules! I can still taste the banana bread pudding french toast...so good! Great brunch spot with great Japanese cold brew coffee."}
{"text":"Brunch porn. Soft yolk dripping all over the place...ohh baby. This place is amazing and the cold drip coffee is to die. The menu is small but mighty. Very cute little spot that looks like the inside of an instagram. I love coming here on Saturday mornings for a quick bite."}
{"text":"If you blink or sneeze while looking for this place on the south east corner of Mcdowell and 7th Ave. you will miss it. You grab a menu prior to being seated, get in line to order with the cashier. Once you pay, you'll be given a number, then you can sit at a table.  I had the pancakes, with sausage and two eggs. Delicious!! The syrup is so tasty. You serve your own coffee but juice can be grabbed right before paying. No servers to wait on you, they just bring out your food and you aren't bothered again. It's a bit loud due to poor acoustics and folks chattering. I do not recommend bringing kids, more of an adult restaurant."}
{"text":"Such a cool little place.   I'm not from Arizona so I accidentally drove past the place twice (the entrance isn't on the direct main road).  The staff was friendly and the guy at the counter seem to genuinely enjoy answering questions.  The ice coffee is strong and the flight is a fun way to try new flavors that you wouldn't find at any ordinary coffee chain.  I ordered the Mexican Benedict and the flavor was amazing. I like that it was ground chorizo and not just a patty. It was so filling and a large portion for being Eggs Benedict."}
{"text":"Excellent, excellent!  If you're a fan of the trendy cold brew coffee, they've got a whole wall of it.  You can even get a jar to take-home.  The jar is allegedly for four iced coffee drinks but if you're like me and you like a little coffee in your almond milk, it'll go a lot further.    Because of the rave reviews about the pain perdu, that's what I had to get.  It's essentially bread pudding disguised as breakfast and as far as I'm concerned, that's brilliant."}
{"text":"The banana nut muffins taste like Cap'n Crunch! Their muffins are baked with love. Soft, moist, fresh and flavorful.   3.5 Star review.  I've seen nothing but great reviews and recommendations for this breakfast joint.  It was quite busy the morning I came - looked like some business meetings even took place here. A wait was understood but the lines died out and it got to a point where we thought they forgot about us. When I went to check on my table's order, the guy at the counter let me know that it would be right out. And it did come to us within the next couple minutes. Everyone was super apologetic and a gentleman (perhaps a manager? Owner?) even came by and checked up on us, apologized, and gave us three muffins on the house. Such a kind and appreciated gesture - not to mention those muffins are fantastic! Might even be the best thing we had on the menu!   I ordered the classic egg sandwich. The bread was really soft and you can never go wrong with eggs and bacon. Overall I enjoyed my sandwich. I would order it again.   My boyfriend ordered the Wilcox Avenue which was just eggs, a choice of meat, and toast. Again, simple, he also enjoyed his food with some Tapatio.   My brother and his girlfriend on the other hand did not have too pleasant of a breakfast. He got the Blackstone Scramble, which he said was barely seasoned and had an overwhelming amount of bell peppers.. And she ordered the Mexican Benedict. She is a lover of all Benedict's. That is, until today. The chorizo was not very flavorful. Again, the meal was just pretty bland and the eggs were over poached. There was such high expectations as everyone raves over them but it did not deliver in the least bit.   It made sense why my boyfriend and I were happy with our meals because what we ordered doesn't require seasoning.   What really made me disappointed were the spuds that are served with every meal. Now, I don't know if it's a thing to just kind of boil potatoes and call it good but I was not a fan! The amount of time we waited I feel like they should've sat on the stove top a little longer to get at least a crisp if there's absolutely no flavors added. Not even copious amounts of pepper or ketchup could save those.  Aside from that - if I were around the area, I would probably stop in for a muffin and some tea or coffee."}
{"text":"I found breakfast here a mixed bag. My friend had an egg sandwich, which was really tasty, but I had the Mexican Benedict, which was pretty disappointing. The poached eggs had runny whites, the chorizo was a bit too spicy for a breakfast meal, and the hollandaise sauce was flavourless.  Having said that: it's a funky building, the coffee was good, and the staff were friendly.  I'm going to assume the Benedict just sucks."}
{"text":"I've been here several times and always get the Pan Perdue.  It's excellent.  The staff is friendly and the food is prepared quickly.  I don't drink coffee, but my husband said their iced coffee is the best he's ever had.    My only complaint would be the various signs posted all over the place mandating that you do not sit down at a table unless you have placed your order.  I've never seen such a rule and I've certainly been out to eat many times.  Seems like an odd thing to enforce or care about.  What if your feet hurt or you are old or you have kids with you?  Ridiculous, especially given I've never witnessed a time where someone is standing around with food and no place to sit."}
{"text":"Well a Nother great you'll find quite a simple menu but very good I would go with the banging pocket or the Mexican Benedict!"}
{"text":"I enjoyed this spot. First off you grab a menu and seat yourself then decide what you'd like to eat after which you head to the area where you order you food and drinks. Grab a number and they deliver your food to you. There is a coffee bar where you go to get your coffee. The coffee was good. My food came out fast and was fresh and hot. I ordered the pudding bread French toast (Pain Perdu), it was very good. Very inexpensive place to eat and conveniently located in central Phoenix. Enjoy!!!"}
{"text":"My friend and I stopped by here for brunch based on their Yelp reviews and we were not disappointed! I highly recommend the Mexican Benedict! The people there was super friendly! We're visiting from NY/NJ and we're asking for recommendations and everyone was so helpful! Thanks for a great meal and the recommendations!"}
{"text":"Really great breakfast! And equally important, the service (all off the employees) were so nice and helpful! I had the b.m.o.c. and my husband had the biscuits and gravy. We both got coffee and a cinnamon roll to go. Very satisfying meal and experience!   We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Check this delicious breakfast and brunch spot out! My husband and I both ordered the BLT sandwich which was served with potatoes. My sandwich was served on a wonderful multigrain bread. In between the two pieces of toasted bread was crisp bacon, a blue cheese mayo which I was nervous about, but was the perfect condiment, lettuce and tomato. The sandwich was only $7.50 which is more than respectable for a great sandwich and side. Definitely worth trying!"}
{"text":"I agree with the other reviewers who are reluctant to give a good review because they don't want this place getting \"too\" popular and crowded. However, I had such a positive first experience that I must spread the good news.  This place is unique and a welcome addition to the other cookie cutter restaurants @ 7th Ave & McDowell. The menu is also unique and a refreshing change from the typical breakfast fare offered at most other places. The ambiance is modern, and comfortable. The portions are plentiful and I had no chance of leaving the restaurant hungry because the chef skimped on anything. I will definitely be returning to this restaurant with friends."}
{"text":"Such a cute little place, very clean. Came here on a lunch date. There wasn't very many people at all (later in the afternoon) so we were able to get in and out pretty easily. The food was very delicious, ordered a sandwich (forgot which one) and enjoyed it way more than my date :-0   My only complaint, is the parking sucks as it seems they share a small lot with other businesses."}
{"text":"Unfortunately, I was not a fan of the Mexican Benedict. The chorizo was very greasy and the sopes were stale. I was missing a perfectly toasted, crispy English muffin to soak up my poached eggs. My eggs were perfect but my friend's eggs were overcooked with hard-boiled yolks. I also sampled stale biscuits and gravy. Honestly, KFC has better biscuits. Maybe it was just an off day.   I DID enjoy the outdoor patio and order-at-the-counter/seat yourself nature of the place. Very causal place to hang out with friends over food and coffee."}
{"text":"Eggs Benedict where over cooked but they made them right, pulled pork is NOT Pulled Pork it's the ends of a Dried Out Ham slice, eggs on pulled pork were over cooked as well! Potatoes were half cooked and half burnt, not sure why??? Muffins and Coffee where excellent!"}
{"text":"We werent sure about this place before trying it, it was a random find and not typical to our normal choices. From start to finish it was great --- great service, delicious food, reasonably priced! My husband eats a lot and was full from his BMOC and I had the best waffle I have ever had! Great twist on breakfast. Can't wait to come back again!"}
{"text":"It's THE place to go get Brunch! So delicious! I got mexican benedict eggs and they were fantastic! My husband got the spanish tortilla and it was yummy too!!"}
{"text":"In my opinion, it was difficult to figure out where to order at first, and then was unimpressed by the small menu, especially on a Sunday brunch time.   By the time we got there they had run out of half their menu, and I ended up getting something that looked nothing like how it was described on the menu. It was basically an egg and potato quiche.   The coffee was good but overpriced. The food itself was average at best. The bacon I got was tough. One good thing was the arugula salad, the dressing was delicious.   I would go there again maybe for coffee, but probably not for food."}
{"text":"This place is real close to our house. Love, love, love the cold coffee options. Great food with unusual and delicious menu items! We will be back again for sure. :)"}
{"text":"Great food!  Very nice atmosphere. Pleasantly surprised by their unique menu. They also honor active duty service members and give a military discount. Highly recommended.  Will definitely revisit if I am ever in the area again."}
{"text":"Great food,  great service, great atmosphere! Delicious!  Found this place on yelp and was so glad we ate their today.  Park on 7th ave behind the restaurant."}
{"text":"I work in the area and this restaurant is my go-to for fresh breakfast/brunch. Atmosphere is perfect for a bite to eat with friends, co-workers, even clients.   Staff is friendly and food is always consistently amazing. Truly a hidden gem in Phoenix."}
{"text":"AMAZING! Came on a Saturday morning, the atmosphere right when you walk in is very urban, but comforting. The food was amazing, you order first then sit down and they will bring the food out to you. The owner greeted us and helped us find seating. Food was wonderful, I cannot recommend dining in enough. We were also able to get out coffee to go, which was also wonderful. If you are contemplating something in the menu, ask the staff, the are knowledgeable about the food and ingredients."}
{"text":"Totally surprised by this place. Having just moved here not too long ago I had to find the best French toast spots. DID NOT disappoint. I'm currently waiting to invite people and go again. I probably can't tell you enough how good it was. Everyone in my party of 4 was highly impressed and wouldn't stop raving about the food all day. Kinda weird walking in but plenty of help once you're in. Take a look at the menu and anything you pick you'll be satisfied."}
{"text":"The french toast, waffles, omelets, the orange juice, the employees, the coffee, and the set up. All top notch! Probably the best french toast I've ever had. If you go, get the orange juice. Nothing better than freshly squeezed juice with your French toast, waffles, or omelets!"}
{"text":"Really?!? How have I not reviewed you, Vovomeena? This is my go-to brunch place. I just love it. The decor is perfection. The food is delightful. The biscuits are DIVINE. Do yourself a favor and go here ASAP."}
{"text":"This is by far one of my favorite downtown hipster vibe restaurants for breakfast. Affordable and delicious with large portions. The turkey sausage links are a little dry, but the Portuguese donuts and pain breaky are amazing. It's a sweet spot during the cooler months to just sit outside and enjoy the delicious food and coffee. Great concept, great food."}
{"text":"Very good French toast. It was so good we had to go back the next day for more. I was a little disappointed in the Portuguese donuts but that was most likely just because they weren't the Hawaiian style I'm used to but my wife enjoyed them."}
{"text":"This is by far my favorite breakfast spot in Phoenix. Every time I have family or friends visiting, I take them here and they love it. My savory recommendation is the Mexican Benedict. It's a fabulous balance of creamy hollandaise sauce and kicky chorizo. Also, the potatoes on the side are phenomenal. A sweet dish I can't recommend enough is the Pain Perdu. It's banana bread pudding french toast covered in a whiskey caramel sauce and bananas. This is the stuff dreams are made of. Additionally, there's hardly ever a wait. Even when there is, I think the most I've waited is 20 minutes."}
{"text":"The food was fantastic. Everything else was subpar. The setup of the restaurant on a busy day left us confused and in everyone's way. Very cramped and disorganized. As we placed our order, the man taking our order walked away mid-sentence for 2 full minutes with no explanation or reasoning given to us. After we got through placing our order, we were told to go stand by the wall and the manager would seat us. About 90 seconds later a man walked over and just said \"Seat?\" to us. We said yes and were seated at a table that was halfway in the walkway from the kitchen. Due to this, both kitchen staff and customers who had just placed orders bumped into the back of my chair and head constantly. In the end, we won't be returning. Not due to the food, which was very good, but the service and environment were too strenuous to entice a return visit unfortunately."}
{"text":"Such a fun place. Casual atmosphere and great food. I loved the coffee tasting! Very fun and unique flavors."}
{"text":"I have been talking about trying this place for nearly two years. I am so happy to report that my personal hype was well rewarded!    I ordered the BMOC.. Oh.. My.. Goodness.. Yumm! I'm not a huge pork chop fan, but this one was cooked to perfection. The mixtures of the sweet and savory fulfilled all of my breakfast cravings. The sweet waffle, apple-maple syrup, and Portuguese doughnut paired perfectly with my poached eggs and pork chop.   The portion for the price was incredible. I definitely could not finish my meal, and I like to eat.   I also had the Japanese cold brewed coffee which was refreshing on a warm Phoenix morning.  I was surprised how strong the coffee was. Next time I will try the flight of flavors.   I will be back!!"}
{"text":"French Toast is amazing.  Actually everything here is from the coffee to entrees."}
{"text":"We love Vovomeena! We have been there 5 times now, and the food is always great. I order the Mexican Benedict and my husband orders the biscuits and gravy. We are always pleased with our food... the best part are the spuds! Be sure to order something with the potato spuds!  What makes this place special is the cold-brew iced coffee. We bought a glass jug and bring it to fill it every time we visit. It's delicious! We highly recommend the coffee."}
{"text":"Plain and simply: The biscuits and gravy were to die for. Well worth the quirky ordering system."}
{"text":"I came here for breakfast last Sunday, and I will be back. The cold drip coffee was delicious and the vibe was cool here without a doubt. I ordered the bananas foster french toast- it might have been the best thing I've ever put in my mouth. I heard they close early so get there by noon."}
{"text":"The food tastes great but if you have small children it's a nightmare! You have to stand in line to order food, then wait for a table to become available as it's a small establishment that's quite busy. For adults it's great, with small kids... never again!"}
{"text":"Always great food. Good service. Good coffee. I would go there more if it were a little easier on the wallet but their prices are not outlandish."}
{"text":"$30 for breakfast for two...  No table service.  Order at the counter, find a seat and they'll bring the food out to you.    We had the BMOC - this was supposed to have a \"massive smoked pork chop\"  but really it was a thick piece of brined pork that was over brined: too salty and had the texture of lunch meat.  We were excited to try the famous portuguese donut, too bad it tasted greasy like cold fried fair food.  Ugh.  The best part of the breakfast was the savory crepe.  It was tender and cooked perfectly.  The chicken and scrambled egg filling was a bit flat though.  I did order it without the fontina cheese, perhaps that was supposed to carry the dish?  Each ingredient should stand on its own, and they didn't.    There are way too many other places that have GREAT breakfasts.  Try Melrose Kitchen on 7th Ave/Indian School instead. chilaquiles, huevos rancheros, and bottomless flavored lemonades.  Breakfast for two closer to $20."}
{"text":"Delicious classic breakfast sandwich with a spicy kick of chipotle aoli. The Japanese cold brew is also delicious and very smooth. It is made on very unique system using gravity to drip water into a canister."}
{"text":"Well, I gave Vovomeena another shot and I'm glad I did. From the very beginning the customer service was pleasant and attentive. The restaurant was bustling with smiling people enjoying their meals. I tried the pawtucket west: two LARGE fluffy and yummy tasting pancakes with choice of meat, (I had bacon) and skillet potatoes. My hubby had the BMOC: which was beautifully done and tasty: waffle, pork chop, eggs and a freshly made donut on top. I had this coffee, they seem to specialize in, and it was really good, really. Sometimes we have to give places another chance, I'm glad I did for Vovomeena. (Random: the decor everywhere is well done and intriguing, even in the restroom. hahaha)."}
{"text":"This is a great little gem. The atmosphere seems a little chaotic at first, but they have a great system in which you order, then line up near the coffee bar and the staff finds your table. We went Sunday morning and it was packed, but the system just worked. The coffee is excellent. We ordered the Spanish tortilla and a burrito, both of which were fantastic. Huge portions. If you are a light eater you could easily split any plate. There's lots of local art, natural light, and attentive management."}
{"text":"Finding Vovomeena and parking there are a bit of a challenge.  Accept that challenge!  This delightful, locally-owned place offers wonderful food, ample portions, and high quality at very reasonable prices.  We're vegetarians and Vovomeena makes ordering non-meat items extremely easy.  Have out-of-town guests?  This is definitely a \"don't miss\" for visitors."}
{"text":"I'm not one to give 5 stars, but VovoMeena deserves it. Incredible food, incredible staff. The quality of food was exceptional: fresh, perfectly cooked and thoughtfully presented. Their coffee is excellent too!  Add the donut to your order!!"}
{"text":"Great brunch menu! The weather is so beautiful in phoenix right now sitting outside for brunch is perfect.   .....They were out of the banana bread pudding French toast so I had an traditional breakfast which was still delicious. I will be back for the French toast sooner than later."}
{"text":"So I've lived downtown for over a year now but only just now got around to trying this place for the first time.  Yeah, I know, fail on my part.  But better late than never.  I've always loved Tuck Shop and found out the same owners also run this little breakfast place.  So up early on a Sunday morning I decided to venture in.  I wandered in by myself right at opening.  The restaurant is packed into a cluster of restaurants on the southeast corner of 7th Ave & McDowell.  You can enter from the courtyard patio area on the west or the parking lot on the east.  The interior is cute and comfortable with enough seating for probably around 40-50 people, though it still has the feel of a small tucked away place.  There's a couple of counter areas inside.  One looks like it was strictly for selling their in-house Mornin Moonshine coffee brand.  The main counter is where you put in your order.  No waiter service here as you just order your meal at the main counter and find seating on your own.  Easy enough for me since I was by myself and the bulk of the morning crowd didn't stream in till later.  Looking through Yelp and perusing the menu, the BMOC seems to be the star here so I decided to give that a whirl.  Meal came out to me about 10 minutes after I ordered.  Long story short, this is a breakfast that eats like a dinner.  The layers from bottom to top are as follows:  Waffle, smoked pork chop, apple maple syrup (with actual diced apples), 2 eggs (any style you want), and a fried donut with powdered sugar.  I can promise you won't go home hungry after eating this.  Lots of flavor in this thing.  I especially loved the apple syrup as it helps mellow the smoke flavor of the pork chop and goes excellent with the waffle.  The pork chop itself is well cooked and hearty, though the smokiness of the pork chop might have been a little bit overpowering for my taste.  But overall, good solid chop.  The best way to attack this dish in my humble opinion is to try and get a fork full of all 5 layers at the same time.  You get a little of everything.  Total tab for the BMOC as well as an OJ came to about $15.  Pretty reasonable for the amount of food I got.  I think next time I come here I might give the Mexican Benedict or the Johnnycakes a try.  Overall a pretty solid and unique breakfast and brunch option downtown.  My first experience wasn't perfect, but more than worthy of another visit (and next time it won't be a year in the making)."}
{"text":"I'll start by saying we had a terrible time our first time here.  All too often these days when someone makes a mistake they refuse to fix it.  Vovomeena and the manger Kai did just the opposite.  They made it right by offering two complimentary meals.  We returned, we had great service, amazing food (biscuits and gravy + pain perdu) and will certainly be back again."}
{"text":"Vovomeena is hands down one of the best Breakfast spots in the Valley! I've had moments where I'm dreaming about breakfast there the following morning...I promise it's that good! The biscuits and gravy are probably the best thing on the menu, followed by the Orchard French toast. (Ok I admit, I often get a Portuguese donut on the side because #treatyoself) The waits are often not too bad, even when the line seems out the door, once you get to the register and order, you grab your drinks, grab a table and then the food comes out super quick."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try Vovomeena for a while now, and finally got to a few weeks ago with my brother. He was a bit apprehensive to take \"little sister's advice\" on where to go eat, but I know he liked it -- even though he won't tell me so. Lol.  My brother and I were both wanting a breakfast burrito, but since it was a Saturday, we had to choose something else (they only serve the breakfast burrito during the week). I opted for The Banging Pocket (mostly because that's what the guy at the counter recommended) and my brother got the Tortilla Espanola. I also ordered a latte, my brother ordered the cold brew. Now I'm not much of a fan of cold brew typically, but theirs is amazing! They infuse the cold brew with different flavors so it mixes it up a bit; it's not your normal cold brew, I can promise you that!   Since it was a beautiful Saturday morning and not too hot out, we sat outside sipping our coffee while the food was prepared. It didn't take long for the food to come out though, which was surprising considering they were busy (thanks for being awesome kitchen staff!) The Banging Pocket was, well quite bangin' -- extremely flavorful with the mix of scrambled eggs, Schreiner's banger sausage and smoked gouda (my fave!), with a side of roasted potatoes on the side. Definitely hit the spot with me. My brother devoured the Tortilla Espanola, and said it was amazing (the clean plate would've told me that, though, hehe).   I loved the atmosphere, the food, and the absolutely kind and informative staff at Vovomeena. I just wish it wasn't so far from me. I will definitely drive out here again soon though. It's so worth it!"}
{"text":"Cool little place. Food is good. Service is good. Cashier' default answer is \"no\".   So far, my customer experience is that \"you cannot have onion in your eggs unless you order the omelet with onions mushrooms and avocado.\"   I have the biscuits and gravy. Biscuits are average, gravy is ok and very meaty.  I won't be back."}
{"text":"We stumbled upon this place while searching for some breakfast/lunch places in Phoenix. This place was pretty busy upon entering. There were only a couple of tables open. The food was amazing. The biscuits and gravy were top notch. The biscuits were soft yet had a crispy texture, and the gravy was creamy and had delicious sausage pieces in it. The all-you-can-drink coffee was very good. It didn't taste like cheap drip coffee. It was bold and full-bodied and went very well with our food.   The environment was nice in that the doors were open to a nice patio area with outdoor seating. The only thing is that you can't sit where you want. You have to wait until after your order and then they find a table for you. A positive for this method is that you don't have to scramble to find an open table (like you do at In-N-Out!).   We will definitely return to try the other items on the menu. So many menu items that sounded so good. But they are a bit pricey for breakfast, so we can't return very often."}
{"text":"Great food, great service, great ambiance! I had the mexican benedict and my boyfriend had the wilcox breakfast. Even the coffee was good. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Delicious, fast service and amazing staff You can order at the counter and pick your own table. The food is fresh, clean and tasty. Their coffee latte is really well prepared too. Really liked this place and hopefully I can stop by again when I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Phoenix is literally littered with restaurants.  With a pizza places opening up on every bloody corner saturating the market with tomato sauce and charred crusts, to concept restaurants taking over the world, there seems to be a new \"hang out\" brewery or up and coming hot spot on every corner.  I have been coming to Phoenix now for 6 years back and forth and have tried a multitude of the culinary prowess here in the land of cactus and hipsters mixed with pretentious yoga moms who talk incessantly about their new diets and fired trainers.  It seems unlikely that the boom is ever going to end.  Frankly its a bit daunting and pretty stinkin hard to keep up with them all opening and closing.  But......it is good to know that there are a few places that seem to never loose their food edge.  I apparently stumbled on one today.  Vovomeena is a quaint, ugh...what a stupid word quaint, little gem of of 7th Ave and McDowell tucked behind some of the more annoying chain spots that surround it.  You have to get a menu first and decide what you want before you sit down, which I think is brilliant as it only makes me want to punch the jerk faces in the nostrils when they walk into a small spot with their whole family and their stupid dog in a bag and plop down just to \"save\" their seat.  You people deserve to wait.  You are no more important than the people who are going along with the restaurants rules and regs to keep the flow.    Once you decide off their beautifully minimal menu of about 12 or so items you make you way to the counter, order, grab your number and THEN sit down.  The service is also minimal.  I happen to like that.  They take your order, bring you your food and leave you the hell alone.  They ask if you need anything else and go away.  You are left to get your own coffee and water, which is right around the corner basically from anywhere you are sitting, unless on the patio.  Again I like that.  It cuts down on all the hoopla and stupid speak which, truthfully, unless you are obsessed with yourself, you don't really want to talk about anyway ESPECIALLY AT BREAKFAST!!  I drank to much last night and I want food, good food and coffee and some bloody peace and quiet, so thank you staff.  Not to say they lack anything as they will hop right to if you do, but you are pretty much left to fend.  I ordered the waffle and pork chop with poached eggs and a perfectly crisp beignet plopped right on top.  Whoa doggy it was delicious, every last bite, because I destroyed it like fat kid at Christmas.  I wanted to high five the cooks but they were busy so I gave a verbal \"brilliant\" to the one who was eyeballing me to see if I liked his food.  Seriously people this place is really quality.  My normal haunt is Matt's Big Breakfast or Dicks Hideaway but I have officially got a new fave in the valley.  Thank you FOH Staff and Kitchen of Vovomeena, I will be back to try the rest of the menu and bring my appetite for more of you yummy goodness.  Cheers."}
{"text":"Uber'd my way here from a downtown hotel. Here for work and decided to spend my morning off at this joint. No wait and lots of seating on a weekday (around 10ish). Ordered the first scramble on the menu that includes fried pork shoulder. YUM. Strips of pork shoulder with red and green bell peppers, onions, etc. served with side of tortillas. Was originally going to get a cup of their special Mexican coffee but I saw they had tropical juices and decided on the blackberry tea. All in all delicious food, laid back and friendly atmosphere."}
{"text":"After having missed a particular Vovomeena special posted on Facebook twice I was finally able to secure a taste for myself!  The Pumpkin Spice Pancakes special included scrambled eggs and two links of Schreiner's sausage.  I applied my Five Star offer of $2 off $10  which basically paid for my OJ:)  Before diving in, I Immediately, packed up the bottom of two pancakes, with 5 of the 10 pecans and a touch of the pumpkin spice butter, mmmm!  The sausage was top notch too, even though I'm not really into sausage. And of course, the eggs were made to order.  The pancakes had a balanced sweetness to it, not overly sugary, which made me happy.  Tastebuds were definitely happy with breakfast this morning!  Vovomeena remains a local gem for breakfast and brunch!"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed going to this place. The staff were all friendly and professional. So nice to go to a place where they connect with their patrons.   We got the award winning banana French toast. It was super rich and sweet. If you like sweet this one is perfect. It's pretty much like dessert. The bacon we got with it was yummy, thick cut and perfect for the sweet combo.   The coffee was also spot on. They have the Japanese drip system which was just the perfect jolt for the morning.   I liked the decor of the place and the natural light coming in. And they have an awesome mural at one if he entrances.   Looking forward to going back to trying more of their interesting food."}
{"text":"Finally!!!!!! A breakfast I can rave about. While the menu might not be ten pages of omelets, what they do have is delicious and unique. I got the pain perdu which was phenomenal. No odd dry parts, flavor was incredible. Sauce was perfect. And I got the sausage...yum! Done of the best links I've ever had. Perfect snap and delicious flavor. Hubby got the Mexican Benedict which is fabulous. I'm not a huge chorizo fan nor am I a big corn meal(masa) fan, bit this was epic. My husband who is pickier than a toddler loved it. \"Make sure you give them a good review\" and for him to say that..well it means something. I thought he would be overwhelmed buy the noise, counter order, trendy factor, but in the end none of the discomfort of those things was a problem because the food was that good. Very quick service. I do wish someone ran around and filled your coffee, but it wasn't a big deal to get up and get my own. I'm full, happy, and will for sure be back the next time I'm in town!"}
{"text":"I was in Phoenix recently for the WWE Royal Rumble. To kill some time that morning, my friend introduced me to Portlandia on his iPad in our wretched hotel room. Around 11AM, we were hungry and ready to check out, so we consulted Yelp for brunch options and settled on Vovomeena.  Upon arrival, I wasn't sure if I was still in Phoenix, or somehow had been transported into a Portlandia sketch. As others have noted, it's THAT hipster. A \"flight\" of Japanese cold brewed coffee - really? Even more amusing was the proud barista describing the cold brew process and the different coffees. And I have no idea how he could tell the different coffees apart ... it's easy with a flight of beers, but coffee all pretty much looks the same. But after pinching myself and realizing I was still in Phoenix, I went for the flight of cold brews. (When in Rome ... err ... Phoenix, right?)  The food options were equally hipster, with a selection of a dozen or so breakfast/brunch offerings featuring fresh, locally sourced food. The only thing NOT hipster about the food are the prices. I typically expect places like this to be a bit pricy, but Vovomeena is a VERY good value. Most of the selections are in the $7-9 range. I ordered the most expensive selection - the b.m.o.c. It featues a smoked pork chop, waffle, two eggs, and a \"Portuguese Donut Tower\" (basically a funnel cake) for $9.95. My friend got the \"pain perdu\" - banana bread pudding french toast with a caramel glaze and choice of meat for $7.50. Both portions were ample, and everything was delicious.   And even though this is counter service, the service was great. I joke about the barista, but the kid (he looked like he was 17) was really nice and knowledgeable. It reminded me of talking to a brewer (or beer nerd) at a brewpub - he had that level of knowledge. And when I went back for a 16 oz cold coffee after I finished my flight, he admitted he accidentally made an extra flight, and asked if me and my friend wanted it. Thanks dude! Needless to say, between 1 1/2 flights and the 16 oz coffee, I was amply caffeinated for the day.   Of all the places we went to in Phoenix, this was my favorite by far. I doubt if I ever will be back in Phoenix ... but if I do, Vovomeena is a must stop for me."}
{"text":"Absolutely excellent food. The biscuits and gravy were incredible. I can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"This place has amazing breakfast food! I have tried something different every time and have loved every bite of it all. Their Portuguese donuts dipped in their strawberry jam is out of this world. You definitely have to try this place out. It's pretty busy on Saturdays, but if you go early enough on Sunday you can beat the crowd. They had these ooey gooey butter bars and they were amazing, but I haven't seen them in a while, so that's my only complaint."}
{"text":"Terrific breakfast. Awesome location.   Inside decor is really cool.   Recently went here and took a long time to get my food. The owner took the initiative and checked on our order to see what was going. He came over to my table to advise me that my ticket was lost but they re-entered out order. The owner refunded us our money. Whether this is normal protocol or not, the manager did not have to do it and showed us how amazing their service is.   Even with the mishap, I will still be visiting this place often!"}
{"text":"We were looking for a place to eat brunch when we first got to Phoenix, and this place was PERFECT. The food was good and the staff was very friendly. You have the option of sitting inside or out on the patio."}
{"text":"There's nothing like meeting up with good friends on Saturday or Sunday for breakfast or brunch. It's nice to see an additional local restaurant along this strip. The Tortilla Espanola was delicious and I did sample a yummilcious bite from a Banging Pocket entree. The cozy decor is inviting. The coffee alone is worthy to make me a continued patron of this place. I'm happy to add this restaurant to a string of Breakfast joint faves within Central Phoenix. Cheers!!!"}
{"text":"We walked up to the patio not sure what we were supposed to do, but they had a guy watching out for such visitors and he came over to show us how the restaurant is set up.  So you order at the counter, take a number and they bring the food out to you - kind of like Panera or Paradise Bakery.  We tried the orchard french toast and biscuits and gravy.  Both were solid solid dishes!  At about $10 each, I think the french toast could have used another slice though.  The lemon bar was also very good, though my friend thought it was a bit too tart.  I enjoyed it though, seems like they included pulp which I liked.  The coffee was also delicious - hot not iced.  Yes, I am a fan, though it lost 1 star for portion size."}
{"text":"Seriously, kind of wish I never tried their waffle because it was THAT good! Urgh, now I'll never want one anywhere else! An additional bonus, the bacon was fabulous! Love the atmosphere and how on top of it the staff was! That in itself, is hard to come by!"}
{"text":"Amazing food! Quick,  friendly service! Would definitely recommend! We just landed in Phoenix and were starving, searched the highest star restaurant in the area,  this one popped up.  So glad we stopped!"}
{"text":"Every time I visit this spot for breakfast I think why do I go anywhere else ever? Great food, which by the way they will make simple modifications on if you avoid wheat in your diet. Great staff. The Barista who works on Sunday, I don't know his name, but he's always part of a fantastic experience there. Great attitude, big smile, and on top of his stuff! One of the best neighborhood breakfast places in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Such a cute little brunch place the Vibe is great, and so is the food, it's also known as a great coffee spot but to my personal opinion I have higher expectations for coffee . Customer service is amazing and food was looking forward going back and trying other items on the menu."}
{"text":"Orchard French toast is the best French toast I've had.  Decadently sweet but not cloying. Even the regular coffee is awesome here.  We're from out town and sampling different local places but we'll be back here tomorrow"}
{"text":"Loved the food. A-little more pricey than the regular breakfast but the flavors are definitely worth it. Service was outstanding. Thank you so much for starting Sunday off so well."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this new place on the corner of 7th Avenue & McDowell!  We went with some friends for breakfast yesterday and had a great experience!  Reasonably priced and very fresh food...highly recommend the savory crepes - yummy!  There were at least 4 or 5 other items on the menu that I want to try, so I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"As soon as I arrived for the first time, I was promptly greeted. The ordering process was fast and my food arrived quickly. I had the \"Tortilla Española\" with turkey sausage which surpassed my expectations as a former resident of Spain. The wait staff was very kind and attentive. I ordered the cappuccino also, which was ok...ended up being more foam than cappucino. So, I'll pass and just get the regular coffee next time. Overall great place!"}
{"text":"This is for the coffee only, the coffee here although iced and created via a Japanese method, it did not taste smooth and was slightly bitter as compared to other cold brews I have had."}
{"text":"Super quaint little breakfast brunch spot near downtown. Unique concept- order at the counter, then choose your own seat. We had the three sisters omelette, breakfast burrito and waffle - very fresh ingredients- the side of potatoes was amazing too. Very strong coffee as well. Hard to decipher how the system works if it's your first time, but they walk you through it."}
{"text":"In Phoenix on business and yelped for a good breakfast place. Very impressed with the food, quick service and casual atmosphere. If I lived here Vovomeena would be a fav."}
{"text":"Decided to try this place since it was close to where I was staying on vacation. The set up is different from any other place too. Walk in, get handed a menu, get in line, order, wait to be seated. Once we sat down, our food took less then a minute to get to the table. The food was excellent & the staff was very friendly. I would recommend this to everyone who's around the area looking for a quick breakfast/brunch place. Will go back once I head out to AZ again!"}
{"text":"The egg benedict is so delicious with distinct cheese on top. Good English muffin too."}
{"text":"Stopped in for breakfast with some girlfriends last Saturday after reading so many great reviews, we were not disappointed! The cold brew was life changing and we all enjoyed our meals. Very cute spot, great to see a small business thriving amongst large chain restaurants. We arrived just before 9am and that was perfect timing, this place fills up! All staff were friendly and helpful and the patio is dog friendly. I will definitely be coming back! :)"}
{"text":"Stopped in today for brunch after keeping an eye out for months. Came in with the intention of eating the Mexican eggs Benedict & the pan perdue but went with the special Apple Cinnamon  crepe & the Jenny instead. Food was incredibly delicious, especially the crepe (first time ever trying one but it was sweet & savory & fresh. Only knocking it down a star because those two dishes put me out 34$ with a tip and it wasn't SUPER filling. Nonetheless I will be back for the pan perdue & B&G."}
{"text":"Awesome!  The food is always hot and fresh. I would eat here daily if I could...  Can't wait to explore more items on the menu. I would give 5 stars if it wasn't counter service and if it was easier to get a table."}
{"text":"FREAKING DELICIOUS! 3 Sisters omelette is lil nothing I've had before. A must try. Also the Mexican Benedict with Chorizo on Sopes, aaaaamazing. This kitchen has it down! Plus the lovely manager is extremely personable and all service well timed. Efficient, nicely  designed ambience, for breakfast/lunch, outside or in, easy parking, gorgeous bathrooms with delightfully scented candles and of course incredible food with new flavors that will knock your socks off! A must go, totally awesome. THANKS!"}
{"text":"Staff are friendly and they have great costumer  service. Food is great not greasy. The place is clean and has good ambiance. Their waffle and Mexican egg Benedict are my favorite, very tasty."}
{"text":"Portions were small and the prices are pretty high for breakfast meals. The quality and taste are pretty good. Finding parking is a pain in the rear. A good place to take your out-of-town guests, but we will not return just for ourselves."}
{"text":"We were driving across country and wanted to have a great breakfast. We found Vovomeena in Phoenix - a small boutique breakfast cafe. The decor is contemporary and warm - the coffee is fantastic - piping hot and fresh - the food is artisinal and the menu is well conceived.  There are so many delicious sounding items that we agonized over to what to get. My companion settled upon the biscuits and gravy which he found to be spicy and wonderfully herbal and delicious. The person who took my order was kind enough to give me some a la carte items - so I had the waffle with handmade turkey sausage and two lovely poached eggs on a big white plate. Everything was tasty - with the minor exception that my dish was warm and not hot. The host who made a point of talking to all of the guests came by our table and we talked about the temperature of the food - he graciously offered to change it out and I declined. Everyone there was warm and hospitable. The name of the cafe is based on the Portuguese word for grandmother - and the sense of warmth and family and tradition and breakfast is all wonderfully present in this little place."}
{"text":"Me and my friends came here for the first time on Sunday and let me tell you, this place is sooo good! I ordered the Mexican Benedict which had chorizo and a side of potatoes and it was made perfectly. Amy got the savory crepe which she really liked too and that came with a side of greens.   All in all I really enjoyed the restaurant and environment. The staff was extremely friendly too. On a side note, it would be better if they served mimosas!!"}
{"text":"Pricey, but good. I had a homemade biscuit along with their homemade strawberry jam, and it was delicious. My husband loved their banana pudding french toast. The service is mediocre and they don't allow substitutions."}
{"text":"I'm writing this review years after the fact. This popped up as a brunch place to try and wouldn't let me rate without writing something so this is what I remember of the experience which is why I never went back.   Saw this place advertised in the Sunday paper and decided to try it out. My boyfriend at the time and I went and the place was packed which is usually a good sign. However, given the size and arrangement of the restaurant it was very uncomfortable waiting on a line that seemed to be a bit all over the place and confusing to some newcomers such as ourselves. We waited on line for several minutes with the hope that the food should be awesome and worth the wait and hassle. I'm not looking at the menu but I think he got the Perdu something or other (one of there best dish items) and I had the biscuits and gravy. We were extremely underwhelmed. His dish was burnt and my dish tasted only like sage only. I would give the place one star after the long wait and the overly hyped food but decided to give it two because I don't remember the place being dirty."}
{"text":"Went here on a Saturday morning based on the reading the reviews here on Yelp. Definitely did not have the same experience as so many others. The restaurant is fine, it's clean, on the smaller side, but nice. I go up to the counter and ask the guy taking the order \"which is better: Pancake or Waffle?\" and he straight faced told me \"They are the same, just a different shape.\" That right there I should've walked out. I ended up ordering the pancakes with eggs and a side of bacon and an Iced Tea. Sat down, and they brought my order relatively quickly. As soon as I saw the bacon I knew I wasn't going to dig it. Tried the pancakes, they had a weird after taste. Not sure if it was the syrup or what, but I didn't get through half of them. Bacon was limp and not very good, blah. Eggs were probably the only thing I finished. I was about to take off when the manager was making his rounds and asked how everything was and if I liked it. I informed him of what I thought of the food and he was quick to offer a refund or replacement. That right there was the best part of my experience, the managers customer service(only reason it didn't get a one star).   Needless to say I have no desire to go back or recommend the place to co-workers, friends or family."}
{"text":"We were going to eat here for Mother's Day and we got in line because place was pretty full, it was 3 of us and a baby so while in line my mother already knew what she was going to order since I was going to pay after a minute or two in line so we seen an open table so we figured since we had the baby in her car seat and was hard to carry and wait in line she went to go take the table but apparently you can't get a table until after you order but that's wasn't the big deal because she would of moved the waiter (Jeffrey) came to the table and was really rude and loud and told my mom that she had to get out of the table because of there policy on getting tables before you order and also pointing with his fingers like my mom didn't understand what it meant to leave from the table. If the server would of told us in a nice way maybe we would of stayed but when you are waiting  in  a line with  a car seat they should of at least acknowledged that since it's open seating but the server rudely told u its first come first serve. Ended up walking out and also another couple with a kid left too. Ended up going to The Original Breakfast place on 32nd st and got treated way better!"}
{"text":"Definitely going back again!  I got the Mexican Benedict which was awesome.  Wanting to try the Pain Perdue next time.  It looked delicious.  My friend had the banging pocket which was also excellent.  Service was okay which is why I didn't give the full 5.  I ordered coffee and a water and they just handed me a mug and didn't instruct me where the coffee or water was.  One of the food runners seemed a little stuck up and annoyed to answer questions.  Overall a good experience though.  It's fast casual so you don't really need to rely on the service as much."}
{"text":"Seems like a great little breakfast hangout. I tried the Piperrada (pork, bell peppers, onions, tomatoes, and eggs). This was a good breakfast - everything was tasty and seemed like good quality ingredients.  I've heard good things about their pancakes, and I'm definitely interested in trying out several other items on the menu, so I can see myself coming back often."}
{"text":"The best breakfast in the city center. I recommend their breakfast sandwich and pancakes, so good. They provide quick service, and the staff is friendly and attentive. Strongly recommended."}
{"text":"Best breakfast place in Phoenix! Good prices and every dish is delicious. The atmosphere really makes it special. They have fresh flowers on the tables and even a candle burning in the neatly decorated restroom. Definitely better than any chain breakfast restaurants around."}
{"text":"Not only is it kinda hard to find seating, but the meat is very low quality.  The chorizo was undercooked and the sausage lacked much flavor.  Not sure how you can screw up bacon, but the bacon was sub-par and without crisp.  Potatoes undercooked to finish off my meal."}
{"text":"First time diner. Lifetime fan!  Have always wanted to try cold coffee but didnt want to over-invest in a whole cup of just one flavor......Enter the cold coffee flight of 3 ...Love Love Love it!  Good selection on the menu and the serving sizes are generous, fresh and flavorful. Nice seating on both patio and indoor space. Go!"}
{"text":"Great breakfast, really enjoyed the breakfast potatoes, that are typically a miss for me, and the biscuit was tender and flaky. I am in the area all the time and never realized this little gem was there. Definitely can easily become a new breakfast fav!!!"}
{"text":"I had a good experience here. The Mexican Benedict is great! It comes with potatoes. The service was also good. You go in, place the order, pay, get your coffee while the manager gets your table ready, and finally eat. The coffee was also good too.   I wish they had bigger portions here. Or at least a little bit more stuff in the menu to order on the side. Makes it seem like if you want anything more, you just have to get another meal. Overall good place and I will go back."}
{"text":"I had the Savory Crepes, and it was very good. Portion was generous as well.  I went on a Sunday and the wait was not very long. Staff was super friendly, and decorations make this place very cozy, good for meeting up with friends! This place was not so loud that you couldn't hear yourself talking.  Also, they have outside sitting that I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Normally this is a 5-star joint. I've had 5-6 wonderful and delicious meals here. But today was different. Today I ordered the sausage... I do not like their sausage. I'm told they get it from Schreiners, who are sausage kings around here. Others may like it. To me it was overpowering and textually displeasing.   I will return (and I'll order the bacon). The other meals I've had have been amazing. The staff is friendly. There is outdoor seating as well."}
{"text":"Food was DELISH!!! Loved being able got kids eat in the patio and our puppy was with us while we were in town visiting from CA. Thank you!!"}
{"text":"Great, great, great breakfast place!  The best I have had since moving to AZ.  The owner is from RI (no surprise given the top notch food) and many of the dish names will make you nostalgic for the Ocean State if you ever spent much time there.  Try the cold brew coffee.  It is great!"}
{"text":"I was here last week and finally made a yelp account because this place has one of the best customer service that I have seen.   First, my food order was made wrong, so I boxed it to take home (several hundred miles away) and they literally went all out to make it right, but I had to leave to start my journey home. Back home, family enjoyed the chicken fijata pita. So I would say, it would be a good food to take home.   Second, wow, the customer service is amazing. Everyone was super nice and accommodating. I would totally visit here again.  Lastly, this place made my Phoenix trip worth it. I would recommend this place for breakfast and to try out, because they have the most awesome customer service I have seen.   So give it a try and judge for yourself.   Happy breakfasting."}
{"text":"Love this place... Atmosphere is great, very friendly,  but parking is sometimes a little crazy.  Great food, coffee orders are sometimes a little slow,  but those donuts make it all worth it!  Yum, just like the ones I had in Maui."}
{"text":"Good concept and great space.  The menu is small but has some potentially exciting dishes.  Expect to wait in line, as a lot more people are becoming aware of this place and the only have one register to pay at.  Once you have ordered and are seated, don't expect to get your meal right away or even at the same time as other people at your table.  I think once they iron out the kinks it could be a really cool place for brunch and to hangout for coffee.  I am not sure it will be on the list of places to return to any time soon."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I love this place. It's definitely our #1 choice for breakfast. Service is great and so is the food. The owner always acknowledges us, says it's nice to see us. I get the 3 Sister's and my bf gets the Wilcox Avenue. Also, if you sub a veggie for meat they take a dollar off. Two thumbs up!!!"}
{"text":"I've eaten here once; I got their food to go once; and I walked out without eating once. My first visit was odd. I ordered the staff recommended Mexican eggs Benedict. The plate was way overpowered buy the taste of chili. Chili for breakfast is not appealing nor tasty.         For the takeout \"I went back to give them a second chance\" I ordered scrambled eggs, sausage, and tators. It was good.           Then came my final visit. I arrived on a weekend with four family members including my wife. When we came in my wife sat at a table while I went up to order (it's weird but you order at a counter NO servers here). While I was waiting to order a manager or staff member went over to my wife and told her that she \"couldn't squat at tables, that the tables turn over fast and that she could only sit down after ordering\". Odd right? My wife got up feeling unconformable, told me what happened and we left.          To be honest their food isn't that good. I just wanted desperately to find a breakfast place to go to regularly. Phoenix is missing good breakfast places."}
{"text":"we went to Phoenix for a show and our son found this place.  Being in the restaurant business myself  I am not so easy to please..... however I found this place so very refreshing with dishes out of the wall. The pricing is right and the food is homy with no pretention to be out of this world. Just VERY good homemade food. My wife asked if she should have the biscuits or whole grain bread. DUH.... the newly fresh baked biscuits were sitting right there in front of her. For those who have all those ideas of what they should do my answer is that those should open their own restaurant and make it better. Easy to talk and critic.... put your money, experience, knowledge and ideas where your mouth is. In my opinion this place is a go. When it come to no changes on your orders....,.. I agree. You are insulting the creator of  the concept. Get a life..... do you ask to split a Mc Donald???? with chipolte sauce???? Mc Do doesn't even know what that is. Congratulation on your concept. Great food and Great coffee. What a way to start the day with a smile."}
{"text":"Me and my husband both really loved our iced coffees!!  Thank you for a great cup of cold brew and a yummy iced mocha, we will be back for sure!! I love the atmosphere and I can tell your passionate about the quality of each individual drink you make."}
{"text":"I normally order the Mexican Benedict and my husband gets the Wilcox Avenue but today we tried to other items! They sure didn't disappoint! I had the biscuits and gravy w/scrambled eggs & my husband ordered the pain Perdu. We wanted something sweet and salty so perfect pair to share. The gravy is simply perfect - full of flavor, bits of meat in it and not overly salty. The Perdu had a subtle sweetness compared to French toast (my next item to try). Needless to say we finished both plates!"}
{"text":"One word, wow. Amazing food. Pork chop and waffles is a great twist to waffles. Can't see anyone not like this meal for breakfast, lunch or brunch."}
{"text":"Great little breakfast place in Arizona, checked it out when i was there for the Cubs Spring Training."}
{"text":"Out here in Arizona and found this gem of a place! Great ambiance, great breakfast! Great if you are short on time. Definitely recommend to out of towners looking for a good breakfast place with quick and polite service."}
{"text":"The B.M.O.C  with large pork chops was grilled to perfection. Really like the charbroiled taste.  I will definitely come back to try some of the other items on the menu. It's sort of a 70\" s theme."}
{"text":"we gave this hip phx spot for breakfast yesterday i had the piperrada satueed vegies with pork shoulder and two eggs i asked for my eggs poached med. unfortunitly they were as hard as rocks the pork was a little dry for my taste my wife had banging pocket which she enjoyed and i tasted as well i thought it was quite tasty service was good and polite the clientele was a young urban mix ...how did i get so old???"}
{"text":"I love the blending of savory and sweet things so I decided to order their B.M.O.C. It's an apple maple syrup topped waffle that comes with a  smoked pork chop ,  2 eggs any style (scramble this time since I was eating with my 1 year old) and a bonus Portuguese doughnut. I really liked how they smoked the pork chop, it was juicy almost like a ham, but not nearly as salty which I prefer. Normally I always get sunny side up/over easy since I love the ooey gooeyness of the egg yolk, but their scramble didn't disappoint. It was light and fluffy and not over cooked at all :). The doughnut was a little too sweet and oily for my liking and by the time I got to it I was already pretty full from the rest of the meal. Also one note, the place starts getting busy around 10:30 on Saturdays, we got there at 9:30 this time and no waits at all."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious food and coffee. Highly recommend the johnnycakes and add on the donut. You probably won't eat for the rest of the day, but it is worth it. Limited seating. Outdoor patio is cozy. Coffee flight is fun and unique."}
{"text":"It was a warm after thanksgiving Friday. I was one of the lone people at the office, my hunger grew and at each attempt for food I was foiled as many places were closed for the day. However I lucked out and found this place. Cute little brunch ish spot.  Most of the menu said \"your choice of meat\" so that meant for me as a veg look elsewhere until I found the roasted veggie and egg burrito (to go only) for ~5.50   I raced back to my desk and tore open the bag. It smelled great maybe beacuse it was also close to 1:30pm and I was starving, but it was a bit small, the tortilla was a bit too soft and moist for my liking the eggs were well cooked as were the veggies the cheese added a bit too much grease for my liking.  The included salsa was unique as it was hot more like a chunky tomato soup.  If you are not veg maybe you will find a few more options than I."}
{"text":"This place is a gem close to downtown Phoenix. Saw the stars and reviews and had to check it out. It was awesome. If you want am incredible breakfast or brunch this is the place."}
{"text":"Food was average. Wifes omelet had a distinct flour or corn meal taste. The biscuits are dry and hard. Manager was not very responsive when asked about the funny tasting omlet. Better places for breakfast if you are looking for food quality."}
{"text":"Awesome breakfast. Every time we go the breakfast I get something different and iris delicious. The biscuits and gravy are awesome. I had the bmoc which was awesome as well. My wife loves French toast and the pain perdu hits the spot. You really need the banana though cause otherwise it's too rich. The food is awesome but the coffee is a lil much. They really sell the cold brew but I wish they upped their game for all coffee."}
{"text":"Yum! the waffles and pancakes are the bomb.  Great food and coffee.   I would say what really impresses me if the staff.  They are always very courteous and welcoming.  I won't go back to a place that has good food but the staff sucks so the spirit of this joint is refreshing.    Good job Vovomeena."}
{"text":"The breakfast crepes are amazing! Same with the cold brew. It is possibly the best coffee I've tasted in my life (try it with Irish cream). Overall really great place."}
{"text":"Fast paced service for how busy it was. Food was delicious and coffee great as always. It's not a huge place but it has a good lay out and overall style."}
{"text":"I had heard that this was a great breakfast spot and it did not disappoint. We went on a Friday morning and it wasn't busy at all and was easy to get a nice table outside for our entire group. You order at the counter and they then deliver your food to you. I had the biscuits and gravy and they were delicious. The biscuits were not my favorite, but they were good, and the gravy was wonderful! I also tried their Japanese Cold Brewed coffee which was very different, but really good. I will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"Loved my vanilla latte, and my husband and I  both loved everything we had for breakfast.  Small, unique spot with outdoor seating as well.  We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Friendly staff and amazing food! I always leave here with a smile and a stuffed belly."}
{"text":"Breakfast with a friend is what brought me here. After the first experience let's say there will be many more dining visits. My breakfast was AMAZING.   The hidden gem has the cutest decor and layout. You can walk in through the patio or the front door that leads to a tiny coffee shop setup. I'm not a BIG coffee drinker but my friend is. He loves the variety of fresh coffee they offer.   In a fast pace moving line I ended up ordering the Portuguese Pancakes, passed on the meat and had the breakfast potatoes. They are called something else but they are potatoes. I will put it to you like this I am a pancake person. It is one food I could eat daily. Vovomeena has the best pancakes I have ever had in my life. I repeat BEST! I don't know what is in them but the flavor is so amazing I eat them without syrup and butter. My potatoes were good too but the is one problem. A good problem every time I eat here I order pancakes and fill up on them so I miss the opportunity to try anything else.   I could go on about the pancakes forever but I have to not fail to forget there service is top notch. This Resturant is all about customer service. Every person who works there you can tell they enjoy their job.   It is worth the travel I highly recommend stopping in and of course getting the pancakes. lol!"}
{"text":"Came for breakfast while in Phoenix for work.  Like many others, I recommend the Mexican Benedict (add hot sauce to taste) along with the Cold Brew coffee. It's a casual spot with a pretty extensive breakfast menu.  Come hungry.  Oh and you order at the counter!"}
{"text":"If you go to Vovomeena, go for the coffee. They have an amazing cold drip system that produces a wonderful iced coffee, and you can tell that the owners take a lot of pride in it. The food is interesting, but ask questions about what you're ordering. The menu descriptions are brief and you may be surprised at what you are actually served."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I Love Vovomeena. Despite a very casual ordering process, the coffee and food are always impressive!   Very hipster decor but it doesn't take away from the relaxed, breakfast/brunch vibes.   We get Johnnycakes almost every time we eat here. One of my favorite and most unique breakfasts in Phoenix. I could eat this every day. The warm rice pudding on the side is a nice touch. Always enjoy the japanese cold brew but the regular brewed and espresso drinks have also been great. The menu and space is small but there is nothing to not love about this place."}
{"text":"What can I say? The food was delicious. The service is friendly and efficient. The atmosphere is comfortable, positive, and relaxed.  It is a little on the pricey side with most of the entrees in the $12.00 range for breakfast.  With that being said, the biscuits and gravy is to die for!    The food is always fresh, full of flavor, complemented by a cozy environment."}
{"text":"The best part of my omelet and potatoes was the potatoes, and they weren't good. Was advertised as omelet with black beans, zucchini, et al. I didnt see more than 15 black beans maybe a flake of a zucchini rind. Wont be back. Omelet w cheese and 12 homefries. 10$"}
{"text":"Vovomeena has some of my favorite food and coffee in all of Phoenix! The best service! The business makes for a fun brunch!"}
{"text":"The main reason why I wanted to try this place was for the reviews... and I expected so much more.  It was a Saturday when I went around 10 am and the line was ridiculously long. This is a self serve place, you have to wait in line to order food, then you have to look for a place to sit (very uncomfortable when the place is full, and its tiny too! ), you get your own coffee and refills. The food was not so great, and lacked a lot of seasoning and flavor. The main thing that bothered me was the lack of accommodation of substitutes for their menu. I eat egg whites, and when I was asked how I wanted my eggs cooked, I said egg whites. The guy gave me this frustrated look and weird stare, and told me with attitude \" No, you can't get egg whites, we don't do egg whites\"  Oh, and they also don't do any sides, you want pancakes? be prepared to pay over $10 for another meal.  Rude customer service, poor food choices/accommodations, and terrible coffee. I've had better breakfast and better experience else where and better tasting coffee too. I will not be returning here, not a fan of overpriced self serve places."}
{"text":"This place was really cute. The only thing I didn't like is that it was not handicap accessible. We literally bumped in to everything but I understand the place is small. The food was good. We ordered the 3 sisters omelette and the Johnny cakes. Johnny cakes tasted like cornbread and it was pretty good all around except for the rice. Not much of a horchata person and that's what it reminded me of. The omelette was perfect, no complaints there. Coffee was great! There was a cute coffee bar inside. Had little jars with sugar cubes, loved it. It almost made me add one to my coffee and I don't even put sugar in my coffee! I will recommend this place. Thanks again."}
{"text":"I landed in Phoenix at 6am, and we were looking for something near downtown.....  We found this place and it was AMAZING!!!  I agree with some of the other reviewers that the lack of servers is strange at first, but it totally works out.    I had a hard time with the menu because everything looked so good.  I ended up with one of the egg options and a delicious buttermilk biscuit.  My wife got the Challah French Toast with apples.  Both were excellent and reasonably priced.  We will visit again for sure.    Lastly, the owner/ manager bussed our table, asked us how the food was, and thanked us for coming in.  This really topped off our breakfast nicely."}
{"text":"Yummy biscuits and gravy at a reasonable price. Clean and cozy atmosphere and super friendly staff."}
{"text":"I took some friends from out of town here and overall it was a good experience. They forgot eggs in my egg burrito but everyone else seemed to enjoy their food! Good quality and the price is what you'd expect for nearby downtown restaurant. The place is small but has a wonderful outdoor patio option and the menu doesn't have too much to chose from but the options they do offer are pretty delish! Cute little coffee station you can pick up your coffee from. I had the espresso.. the coffee quality was ok. A bit sour for my taste but overall not bad."}
{"text":"I love their brunch and their coffee. The food is very unique and it never disappoints. The ambience is \"Downtown Phoenix cool.\"  The place isn't very big but they have a nice sitting area outside."}
{"text":"We love this place, and go there at least once a week, sometimes twice. It helps that we live walking distance away. Fantastic selection of very interesting and well done breakfast dishes, and wonderful Japanese style cold brewed iced coffee.   They have a dog friendly patio around the back, where the waitstaff bring our dogs water in dog bowls without even asking for it.   Even more impressive is the service. We were there today (Sunday) and the place was very busy. My wife ordered her favorite, apple and potato boxty. Some time after we ordered, but before we got served, they ran out of boxty. Kai, the manager, came over and offered her anything else on the menu. And then he did something I had only heard about from my parents, about how fine restaurants used to be run. He comped BOTH our meals in apology for running out of my wife's favorite. I thought this kind of service had gone the way of the dodo. I was blown away."}
{"text":"Have to try this place out. Is refreshing to find authentic dishes and a cool place to hang out. The service is really good, and you'll want to try every dish on the menu. Coffee is superb as well."}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere and location, small and cozy and the staff is extremely friendly. Awarded best in Phoenix for a reason! DO RECOMMEND FOR ANYBODY! Prices are excellent and the food quality is high and reminds me of home! Love this definitely coming back as much as I can."}
{"text":"If you like breakfast food, now let's be real-- breakfast is the best, Vovomeena is the place to have breakfast/brunch. They also serve one of the best coffee in the valley. They get it from a roastery in Cave Creek, AZ called ROC2. They have pancakes, eggs, bacon/sausage, Portuguese donut, daily fresh desserts, spuds... List goes on and on. They are simply amazing. Give it a try and you will fall in love. Guaranteed. Oh they also have a really friendly staff. All in all, nothing but best..."}
{"text":"My partner and I have been to Vovomeena three times, and everytime it was great. Full disclosure, though, the second time we went we only got the iced coffee as their kitchen had run out of food! (This was around 12:30 on a Sunday; absolutely forgivable for a restaurant who just opened and is working out the kinks, and if that's the worst thing that will happen when we visit then that's a pretty great sign.)  The space is absolutely gorgeous. You forget that you're in the midst of a glut of chain restaurants and it definitely rivals the Tuck Shop for ambiance. It's wonderful that they're both different yet obviously part of the same family. Another thing those two spots have in common? Gorgeous, uni-sex restrooms. It's a small touch, but it always make a restaurant feel more like home when the washroom is nice and I always appreciate non-gendered restrooms.   Another plus is the counter service; it makes things a little quicker and is smart for the lunch concept. The service itself has been gracious, from the barista to the counterperson to the kitchen staff to the busers, with a special mention to the manager, who has been sincere and nice. This level of service is impressive for a new restaurant. (Stark contrast to the Chipotle 20 feet away, where the staff still acts like it's the first opening day and runs around like chickens with their heads cut off, but that's a whole other review!)  Lastly, the food is fantastic. I had the B.M.O.C. the first time to quench my enormous weekend appetite and the pork chop was remarkable. The waffle got a little lost, but I tried the waffle on its own the last time I was there and I think I'll just get that from now it, as it's really fantastic all by itself. Other items tried and approved, the tortilla espanola and the johnnycakes were really great. (The rice that comes with the johnnycakes was a fantastic complement to the johnnycakes, please don't get rid of it like another review suggests!) The prices are fair, I think ordering a la carte might be the most economical option if I end up going here as often as I want to. Also, the food comes up a little slowly but it's nothing unusual for brunch.  My only critique, although I'm not taking off a star: please get real maple syrup! I saw some fake syrup being walked into the kitchen one day, and the syrup that came with the waffle seemed overly sweet, so I'm guessing that the real stuff isn't being served. I could be wrong, though, as I'm not maple syrup expert, just an enthusiast. All the other ingredients seem top notch, though (thanks for locally sourcing the meat, so this former vegetarian can eat it without much guilt!)"}
{"text":"Doesn't quite crack the 'exquisite' barrier for me, but they've got it figured out. It's super tasty and manages to have a unique flavor. I had the weekday egg and veggie burrito with their chunky mild red sauce on the side. I'd eat here again, for sure."}
{"text":"Fabulous European style place! Innovative menu.... Loved it, and can't wait to go back...."}
{"text":"This is another Phoenix jewel for breakfast. I love this place. It's cozy and comfortable. Their food selection is gourmet-ish. For example, their french toast is very custardy and is made with Challah bread. Very few places will use expensive Challah bread for french toast even though it's the best way to make it. They also use honey marcapone and grated apples in their french toast. Amazing! My mouth waters just thinking about it. Definitely recommend it."}
{"text":"Loved this place.   Delicious food.  The set up was unique.   Great find during my trip"}
{"text":"Incredible. Top two are the Mexican chorizo sope eggs Benedict with a side of arugula and also the biscuits and gravy with schedulers sausage and side of potatoes. I brunch a lot and this is the best breakfast I've ever had in Phx. #native"}
{"text":"This restaurant is my favorite for french toast days.  They have an Orchard French Toast that has fresh slivers of green apple and a sauce you could die for.  Delicious!  But don't go on Sundays cause that's when I am there and I need the table."}
{"text":"Exceptional food and service.  The Johnnycake's we're amongst the best I have ever had.  Get the sausage!"}
{"text":"Got my family addicted to this place. It's the only place they want to brunch.  Happiness is a cold brew.  I love their cardamom flavored one,  they have plain and other flavors too every day.  I've had their whole menu and I love everything."}
{"text":"How is this place so highly rated. I could barely finish what I ordered. The eggs are inedible and everything else was incredibly salty. Maybe I just ordered the wrong thing?"}
{"text":"OMG I love this place . I could eat just about anything off the menu and be happy. (Just about, because I don't eat beef, but seriously anything else) The food is just damn good. Absolutely one of my favourite breakfast places in CenPho and every single trip here has been a wonderful experience. They have enough cold brew here to fuel a zombie army for ever with those massive yama towers in the background. The coffee is fresh and strong and the barista is very friendly and helpful.  The decor is definitely worth taking a picture or two, the place is spotlessly clean every single time and  the portion sizes are generous. Definitely will come back for more !"}
{"text":"I had been wanting to come here for awhile so I'm glad we made the 30 minute drive to come! Everyone was so friendly. all of the staff came up to us and made sure we were good and had everything we needed. The iced coffee was really great! I ordered the BMOC and my bf got the banging pocket. They were both really delicious. I would order either of them again. The atmosphere was comfortable, modern, and clean. One thing I did not expect was that it was counter service. We will be back!"}
{"text":"My friends and I needed to find a good restaurant on our way to Phoenix Comic Fest in May 2018. We decided to try this place, and we were amazed by the fresh food and excellent staff. We would recommend the pancakes and biscuits and gravy. Although, we were even impressed by the toast and jam with eggs, and the chorizo was just perfect. The coffee is the best we have tasted, and we ended up returning for breakfast for the following day of the fest. Next time I visit, I will bring my family and friends. I cannot wait to try other items on the menu. I highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"Food and atmosphere was very good, Kaj the manager made us feel very welcome and my wife and I will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"Charming atmosphere and amazingly friendly staff!  By Far my favorite breakfast potatoes in Phoenix!  Not to mention, for a Midwestern girl from St Louis, Gooey Butter Cake!  The Japanese cold brew coffee is sooooo good!"}
{"text":"It was hard to go back to Starbucks on Monday morning after drinking the Japanese cold brew here. I got the flight o' 3 and all of them were smooth and complex and resulted in a nice pleasantly sustained caffeine buzz. My wife got the Blackstone scramble and I got the Mexican Benedict, both were amazing, and the kids loved the pancakes and waffles. It was a little pricey for breakfast($70ish with tip for 2adults/2kids), but the food was definitely worth the price. Great spot to spend a leisurely Sunday morning with family. We will be back."}
{"text":"Decent.  Not expensive. Busy. Pretty standard brunch.  Little things hold it back. Biscuit tough. Entrees lacking depth or sides."}
{"text":"Pricey, but great food, customer service is a bit cold and uninterested but otherwise just fine."}
{"text":"This spot got our morning off to a GREAT start! You grab a menu and look at it while in line, but the options are so many you won't know when you get to the register. Thanks to all of the great yelp photos, the winner of my \"tournament of decision\" was the Mexican Benedict.  From there, I was able to step to the side to order an iced mocha before sitting down wherever we wanted. I think this is a great wrinkle because the food comes out quick and seats for most in line are available, like clock work. NO one was standing around waiting for a seat even though the line was to the door when w got there.  The Mexican Benedict was amazing, with a spicy chorizo along with the usual. I found myself savoring every bite, and the flavor was consistent.   The manager was warm and informative to everyone eating, and we felt so enjoyable while we ate good food. Such a smooth and pleasant time before the day had turned epic.   This is a great place to fuel up with good quality food and brunch energy!   Well done, Phoenix!!"}
{"text":"Here's the deal.  The food sounds special but it really isn't, and normally that would doom a place to me.  But... I keep coming back.  Why?  Because I don't come here to eat amazing food.  I come here to hang out in a casually stylish environment with good music and truly good coffee in a dedicated daytime establishment.  VVM definitely owns its slice of the restaurant ocean by sticking to a simple and stylish formula."}
{"text":"Went today for brunch and enjoyed the Mexican Benedict and Bread Pudding."}
{"text":"Went here for brunh a few weeks ago and I've been contemplating on going back sometime soon! The food is delicious, I had the tortilla espanol. Not sure why they call it tortilla since it doesn't have any but either way, it was great. Perfect meal size for brunch. Nice music selectionn! Like I said before, I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Me and my alleged better half met some of her friends here for brunch.  I was skeptical walking in as it looked like a very basic coffee shop but I guess I should never get tired of being wrong.  I had a scramble with pork shoulder and it was delicious.  The lady had an omelette that was tasty.  And how can I turn down a donut in any form?  I had the Portuguese donut which was like a beignet and just as awesome.  The staff was really friendly.  However, just be careful if you come during a busy hour, table space is limited.  And don't be that guy who comes in and plops down at a table before ordering.  They have rules about that."}
{"text":"I live in the neighborhood and I have heard wonderful things about this restaurant. I got up early one morning and decided to go down and try their cold brew. The restaurant opens at 6:30 and I arrive at 6:25 with the doors unlocked. I peaked my head in and asked if they were open. I told, who looked like the owner, I just wanted to grab a cup of coffee. The server snottily replied that they weren't and I need to come back after they opened. I thought five minutes was strange but I went back out to my car. Just as I do that I see three people walk in and get seated for breakfast. So strange.  I have heard the world about their  cold brew and had to try it. The wait staff was so cold even after I told them this was my first time there and to tell me about their coffee selections and menu. I, myself, am a culinary school graduate and a past restaurant owner. Customer service is everything. I ended up settling on a six dollar cup of the worst cold brew I've ever had. It was so bad that I told the man waiting on me that the coffee tasted strange, asked for a different kind and to hold the sweetener. I then walked over to the coffee bar to add my own sugar when I look down and see the entire table covered with ants. They did promptly clean up the table. The cold brew was absolutely disgusting, the customer service was even worse and I won't be going back to try breakfast. So sad."}
{"text":"I have never been disappointed while eating here. Every time is a pleasant experience. Yeah, some times when it's busy I can see a little bit of delay with the food but nothing overwhelming. Staff is always helpful and super friendly. And will be happy to add that it is REALLY clean. Big fan of this place and I recommend it to anyone looking for good breakfast with a twist."}
{"text":"Good, but almost too hip for this self proclaimed foodie. Two over medium eggs, sausage, potatoes, toast. It's breakfast, not art. Fifteen minutes to get to me and being picky, no run to the yolks. Not killed, just not perfect. No subs, out there indie music, order and sit. Food was good; it's me vovomeena, not you."}
{"text":"This is my new favorite breakfast place. The food is creative and very high quality. I've had the breakfast sandwich and the sausage pita and loved them both. The place also has a cool vibe."}
{"text":"My husband and I were looking for a cool place to have brunch! And we found this small hip place! Its a gem! The food and coffee were great! The portion was very generous!   -the drinks should be serve first before the food though- just a thought"}
{"text":"How about Vovo ya-dont-mean-it  or My best guess at how Vovo used to cook but that was a long time ago and I don't remember!  I'll tell you what, the name implies Portuguese food but having grown up on it, this is the farthest thing from it and a huge disappointment!   Obviously the people who have given it a high rating have never experienced a GREAT Portuguese breakfast and have been fooled into thinking a luke warm grease drenched not fully cooked lump of batter is a donut or treat in the traditional style of cooking..... NOT!!!  I asked the server if they have Linguiça which is a traditional Portuguese sausage and he said he thought they had it once but no..... I'm not sure he knew what I was talking about. ..... Vovo-no-idea!   We all commented on one common denominator of each of our pretty tasteless orders....... The eggs!!!   Real or Powdered (reconstituted) ..... either way, just not very good.  I ordered Blackstone Scramble.  I expected what I read, \"Pork Shoulder\" and seriously folks, it paled in comparison to a Denny's Denver omelet..... it was a very strange thin finely chopped ham colored meat.... very odd.  I do not see this restaurant lasting.......  This is Phoenix and what we have come to know about eating out there is that, \"If it is going to make it, it has to be consistently good\"  There are sooo many restaurants there and sooo much competition amongst them that this place is not going to last.  The seating is horrible not to mention Stupid.....  I get the first come first serve thing but we were told to just hold on and not get excited because we would get a great seat...... It never happened and we were three people assigned to a two person table that we couldn't get all the plates on and on the patio between two doors causing us to be brushed up against by every server and patron........    The inside has a neat trendy look and feel but I need more than that in order to appreciate it as an actual eating establishment.  Oh, the coffee was good...... I'll up it a star!  Forgettable!"}
{"text":"Food was out quick but somehow 5 minutes into eating me and my friend who both ordered different dishes started to feel sick...dont know what it was but it tasted good while it lasted."}
{"text":"It's been over a year since my last rating, and we still come here 1-2x a week.. sometimes more, and sometimes we stop in just for a coffee to go. :)   If the cold brew float is available, be sure to try it.  The combination of cold brew and gelato is incredible.    I still love the Banging Pocket.. also during the weekdays they have an amazing pita they call the Palmcroft which is scrambled eggs, gouda, turkey and bacon.  The tortilla espanola is so good and one of my favorite comfort foods.    We eat mostly gluten free now (my better half has to for his health) and it's very easy to do here.  Skip the pita or toast and there's easily over a half dozen things on the menu you can have.    Great food, great staff - this is our favorite breakfast place!"}
{"text":"Fun little spot for breakfast or brunch with some inventive twists on the typical brunch fare. Had the bangers and eggs which was tasty and filling. The savory crepes which my friend had will be next on my list. Stand in line to order and then seat yourself format is ideal for when everybody can't make up their mind at the same time. It was on the noisy side inside at 10 am on Sunday so we ate outside which was lovely. All in all a fun and relaxing brunch date with friends. Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"This place was pretty good. I got the Savory crepes they were really good except they came with some weird red sauce. Didn't ruin the meal but if I ordered again I would request that not to be on it"}
{"text":"This has become one of my favorite local spots for brunch. Nothing on their menu has ever disappointed me! One must definitely try the Mexican benedict and the BMOC. The service is great and the staff is always super nice. Sometimes the place can get crowded and it's kind of small, but nonetheless this place is worth trying."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious breakfast food, wide variety of food and beverages. I had the apple French toast with bacon which I couldn't have liked more.  The coffee and lattes were standard, not bad but not amazing.  The ambiance is nice, it is a unique trendy place"}
{"text":"I really hate to write this but the Mexican benedict meal made me sick... really sick.  First, the pros:  - Clean setting. - Great vibe. - Lots of people. - Friendly staff. - Great looking pics on Yelp.  Based on all the pics on Yelp, I decided to order the Mexican benedict. The chorizo sold me. When it arrived, I started to indulge in the dish and thought to myself that, \"this isn't as good as I was hoping.\" No big deal... I still liked the place and the vibe. The reviews were good and when I'm back in the area, I'll try something else. I'm not one to want to waste food so I finished my plate and started to go about my day. Again, no big deal.    As soon as I got into the parking lot, I started to feel weird. Maybe a little gassy... that happens, right? I just burped it along as my buddy and I were headed to play a round of golf. I'm still a little gassy on the first hole (not even an hour after eating). Then it hits me on the third hole. Not to be too graphic, but it was coming out of both ends and all I can taste coming up was the chorizo.  It's been a few days and my tummy is still a little unsettling from this meal.  I'm not writing this to tell you not to go there because clearly people have enjoyed their experiences but I will be very hard pressed to give this place another shot."}
{"text":"We honestly stumbled upon Vovomeena after a stop at another business down the block.  We turned up the alley and saw Vovomeena.  After a quick Yelp check, we decided to have breakfast.  Am I glad we did! We hate chain restaurants and this is any thing but!  We ordered the BMOC.. smoked pork chop over a waffle....Awesome! The other offerings are different and we look forward to returning. They also have a parking lot ..a plus.  It became ridiculously crowded at noon.  I recommend coming before that to avoid that problem."}
{"text":"Best breakfast ever! My husband and I only come here for breakfast. Everything is amazing especially the iced coffee! That is something special, it takes a week to brew one pot of it. Simply amazing!"}
{"text":"A trendy little coffee and brunch spot!  Good coffee in a cute little cafe setting.   Friendly staff. Jeff was super friendly and had a good sense of humor...  Plan on $10-$13 per person for food and $3-5 for your coffee.  The classic breakfast sandwich was really tasty! Good hot coffee Tasty iced coffee too!  Parking is tricky and you will get towed for parking at nearby businesses."}
{"text":"I had the Pain Perdu.  It's a banana bread pudding French toast with whiskey Carmel sauce. My son had biscuits and gravy. I also added eggs and coffee to this and we came out at right around $20. This had to have been one of the best breakfasts I have ever had. Love the option of outdoor seating."}
{"text":"This is definitely a cool brunch spot. Very much worth a visit.  Quick and easy. Order at the register, take your number, grab a seat, and they'll bring your food to you.  I got the biscuits and gravy which were AMAZING. The gravy is seriously to die for. I could have their biscuits and gravy everyday! I had left overs and purposely saved it for the following morning just to savor the gravy. Yes. It. Is. Divine.  My cousin got the waffle with sausage and eggs. The waffle was also delicious!! She's also in loooove with their Japenese coffee!  As for the rest of the menu, there wasn't that much more that was screaming out to me. I knew biscuits and gravy was the right option, and it did not disappoint. We'll probably be back..... just for the biscuits and gravy. Lol"}
{"text":"My first time here, and definitely not my last! I ordered the Pain Perdu (bread pudding French toast) and sausage link and they were delicious. This dish is very sweet and more like a dessert than a breakfast, but nonetheless great. Nice ambiance, friendly staff, and a well oiled machine with their effective operation (food order/seating/cleanup)."}
{"text":"It was my first time at Vovomeena yesterday for lunch and I must say that I will never come back again due to lack of customer service.  I was sitting outside enjoying my lunch, catching up with one of my girlfriends when the waiter came and took away the patio umbrellas and rudely stated that they were closing early because they ran out of ingredients. It was only 1 pm when this occurred, and the restaurant is usually closed at 2:30 pm on Sundays.   If your restaurant states that it is open for business until 2:30 pm, please do not kick out your customers who have already ordered, paid, and are in the middle of enjoying their meal before closing time.."}
{"text":"Good experience at Vovomeena. Hubby had johnnycakes - bacon and sweet rice get 5 stars. Prickly pear syrup was too sweet. I had the special which the kind host made gluten free and switched out the cheese to something not so spicy. It was delicious. The staff was very friendly and gracious. We are looking forward to returning. Vovomeena is the closest thing we have experienced to Marche (for our Nashville friends)."}
{"text":"Dropped by Vovomeena on a weekday to grab some delicious brunch fixings with a friend. Parking was pretty easy and we were able to get in and order right away which was great! You put in your order at the counter, walk over to the coffee bar if you got a coffee drink, and then sit down with your number and wait for your food to come out.   I was in a super french toast mood so I went with the orchard french toast and of course got a side of the spuds. I also grabbed a japanese cold brew because come on, you can't pass up on coffee. Now in terms of the food, the french toast was deeelicious. Sweet without being too overwhelming and definitely a good portion for the price. Man the spuds were so good, they almost overshadowed the main dish! They were really well seasoned and tasted great by themselves and with hot sauce! The japanese cold brew didn't really meet my expectations, but I'll probably try out a different coffee drink when I'm there next time.   Service was great and the food was delicious so I can definitely see myself dropping by again!"}
{"text":"I ordered the Mexican Benedict and my friend ordered the Breakfast Sandwich, and both of them were amazing!!! The Mexican Benedict is definitely my favorite. This is a great spot for breakfast/brunch!!!"}
{"text":"This place was great! Great atmosphere, food was exceptional and staff was super friendly! Also easy to get to. I got Mexican Benedict and if you like chorizo it is amazing. Spicy, but amazing. My friend got the corn and chile cakes which are like cornbread pancakes and they were equally amazing! 10/10 would recommend"}
{"text":"Tried this place for breakfast over the weekend and it's definitely not what I expected for a breakfast spot. You order from a selected menu and pay up front; then, they give you a number and you wait at your table. Their coffee is awesome and the staff is super friendly, but I wasn't too keen with having a selected menu. Reading \"No Substitutes Please\" at the top of the menu didn't help either. The food is okay but nothing blew me away or would make me want to come back."}
{"text":"Breakfast is delish! So awesome, it's really hard to find parking. The first time my kids and I went, line was out the door, but was worth the wait."}
{"text":"Me and my bf have been wanting to try this place for a while because we've seen other Yelpers' reviews and pictures. First off, for first timers, vovomeena is one of those places where you stand in line and order first then get to find a table, which I don't mind, unless there are no tables available by the time you order. We ended up sitting outside. The food came out pretty quickly; I ordered the Mexican Benedict and my bf ordered the Banging Pocket. My food looked good at first glance, until I noticed a puddle of grease under the eggs. Since it was a variation of a traditional Benedict, it came on sopes instead of English muffins, which was not my cup of tea. The Banging Pocket was described to me as cheesy eggs and sausage in a pita.  It was very one-note and just needed something... The food was nothing to rave about and definitely nothing to come back for. We decided that this was one of the few times Yelp ratings and reviews let us down :("}
{"text":"While visiting Phoenix I saw that this place had 4 and a half stars on yelp With 400+ reviews so you know I had to check it out!    All I can say is WOW!  This place rocked, I came with 2 buddies and we all cleared our plates.  I ordered tortilla espanola, one of my buddies ordered the Mexican Benedict, and my other buddy got pain perdu which looked like a brownie with bananas and caramel!    It's an interesting setup, you order at the counter then take a number to your table, the staff was very attentive to us and made sure we had everything we needed (hot sauce).  It's right next to 5 guys off 7th, took a lap around the block to find but WELL WORTH IT!"}
{"text":"WOW!! Honestly one of the best cafe-type places i've ever been. The staff is super friendly, the food is great, and the sweet tea is AMAZING. Make sure you try the potatoes and mango iced tea. I was on vacation from Minnesota and we went here for breakfast every single day (4 days in a row). The manager even noticed we were frequent customers and wrote us a coupon for 1/2 off our next meals. I wish I could bring this restaurant back home with me!! If I could rate over 5 stars I would."}
{"text":"This is a solid breakfast joint for sure. The Johnny cakes were delicious, highly recommend it. They are corn based with bits of fresh corn with a hint of chili. They aren't spicy and have a really great complex flavor. We also ordered the waffle with eggs and a bacon. All were solid. You order at the register, take a number, and seat yourself."}
{"text":"Love Vovo. Food and Coffee are great. Cant really go wrong here."}
{"text":"A nice experience. It was fun to watch the cooks while you stage to order. The online menu is a little hard to see but the mystery drew us in. Fresh, filling and flavorful. Pet friendly patio. If you feel they are too busy - put your brakes on and find your patience button. It is worth it!!! Tip: Some people ask questions when they order and that can cause a brief delay.  You'll have the same space and time."}
{"text":"We went for breakfast on Sunday morning, and managed to beat the rush. The decor is fun, albeit totally hipster. There's a great little patio which you'll totally find me on, once the weather isn't so damn miserable. The menu is small, but mighty, and there are oodles of things we want to go back to try.   Now, I realise that I'm one of the few less-than-four-star reviews, but I have good reason! I would have given this place 5 stars, had it not been for two things that made me knock off a couple stars.   But first, let me start with the really good stuff: the food. In general. We got the Johnnycakes and the Mexican Benedict to share. The star was the johnnycakes. They sounded interesting, but neither of us were prepared for the incredible flavours. The cakes themselves are actually pretty savory, with whole kernels of corn, and green chilis. They've got texture, and a little bit of a kick, and by themselves are so good. Pair them with arroz con leche, strawberries, and syrup, and you've got a flavour combination that is enough to wake up any pallette! I made sure to get some of the cake (with syrup), some of the arroz con leche, and a strawberry on to my fork... wow. Just wow. Green chilis and maple syrup are not a combination I would have imagined being tasty, but damn! The savory with the sweet was just the right balance. And the bacon it came with was thick-cut and damn good.   The Mexican Benedict was pretty great, too. The chorizo was the real deal! But, here's where I took off a star... the eggs were overcooked. You can't have eggs benedict with overcooked eggs. The yolks weren't runny, which is the best part! Solid yolks were a total disappointment. I had to take a star off. I was so looking forward to runny yolks, mixed in with the chorizo. The potatoes also contributed to my removing a star or two... they were just blah. Nothing special. Not a lot of flavour. Compared to the flavour of the johnnycakes and the chorizo, I expected something a little more interesting, even if they are \"just potatoes\". Not a lot of seasoning, and I think they may have been cooked with onions, only one small sliver of onion made it on to my plate with the potatoes. Boo.   The other reason I took off a star: the coffee. They're all about their Japanese cold brew stuff. My lady friend LOVES cold brew coffee, and ordered a coffee float, with vanilla bean gelato. Mind you, the cold brew was one of the main reasons we went there. Sadly, her coffee was so bitter it was practically undrinkable. I'm not a fan of coffee, but even I could tell it was way more bitter than it should have been, when I tasted it. So that was extremely disappointing.   We'll be back, and I may give the benedict another go, but this time if the eggs are overcooked, I'll be sending it back. Yes, I'll be that dude. Same with the coffee. I'd love to see them do something to amp up the eggs, especially since the rest of their food has so much going for it. It's sad to see the potatoes fall flat. We are excited to try the other things on the menu... it's just a shame that the things we were most looking forward to fell kind of flat.   But those johhnycakes though!!!"}
{"text":"Try the banging pocket with extra Gouda per recommendation of one of the waiters. Good ambient and friendly staffs."}
{"text":"Based on the reviews I was expecting A LOT more. We ordered the Mexican Benedict and the pork shoulder with eggs and tortilla.  I ate the Mexican Benedict, it was good. I prefer my Benedict to be a little more flavorful and to have more hollandaise.   If we make it back here we will have to try the bread pudding French toast... it sounds delicious."}
{"text":"I use to live in Downtown and loved going to Vovomeena,  Now I reside in Laveen, Arizona There is no place like Vovomeena down here. Vovomeena is just EXCELLENT! Love the Willcox Ave. Hopefully Vovomeena will open more locations throughout the valley."}
{"text":"Little charming café.  The staff is super busy and so you might feel a little hustled as diners stare at you and your table in envy.  The menu is straight forward and contains quality ingredients.  What would have pushed it over to 4 star territory would have been some extra spice or kick.  You could tell that the ingredients were great, the coffee made with care, the jam home made even, but the flavors were missing salt?  A little punch? Even a dish that is supposed to contain some spicy flavors (in the form of an excellent roasted fire salsa on the side) was decidedly okay.  So good if you are in the neighborhood, fun for out of towners who might be picky eaters, but selfishly, it was breakfast that I could have cobbled together had I not been quite as slow moving this morning."}
{"text":"I have a thing for home grown , locally owned ..anything. I think it is important to support the community and its efforts, with that being said.. The third time isn't a charm.  First time was just ok- nothing to report.   Second time my corn cake thing was just gross batter used was from the previous day, seriously .  Third time - not amazing. The omelette was to be a veggie mix, and very few findings of the diced zucchini. The sausage was hard and over cooked. The potatoes were under cooked.  The end"}
{"text":"-Pancakes were sweet and buttery, very delicious. -Breakfast sausage kind of tasted like bratwurst, it was a good surprise. -Potatoes were average, mix with grilled onions.   The actual restaurant was very cute and the lady working at the register was very nice. Overall good food and service, but nothing special. I would go back if I'm in the area, mostly because they are local and use local ingredients!"}
{"text":"I ordered the banana bread pudding french toast with sausage, it was delicious! The only thing I have to complain about is there was too much caramel drizzled all over the French toast which made it a bit soggy and too sweet. The service was good and I loved the atmosphere. We will be returning!"}
{"text":"Why bother with a little side of bacon when you can get a whole piece of pork on top of your waffle? WITH eggs AND a Portuguese donut! B.M.O.C. - just do it.   Cute patio area and relaxed atmosphere. Decor is hip and clientele is very mixed. Great people watching :)"}
{"text":"(Lyrics - Lady Gaga - Paparazzi)  I'm your biggest fan I'll follow you until you feed me Vovo-Vovomeena  Bo Bites, there's no other foodie-star You know that I'll be there Vovo-Vovomeena  Promise I'll be kind But I won't stop until I start to dine Vovo you'll be famous Yelp you down until you feed me Vovo-Vovomeena   Vovo Vroom-na!  This place has my heart!  Granted, very hipster-ish, but I can look past that.  I cam here with some friends on a Saturday.  The place was hip and popping with and urban funk.  With an open kitchen cooking up a storm and a barista counter for your coffee.  You need to order at in a line and pick your seating after.  I was looking at the menu; very traditional american breakfast, but with funky modern twist.  I went for the b.m.o.c, Waffles with a pork chop atop and apple maple syrup and finished with an over easy egg with a side of Portuguese donut.  It was sweet and savory at the same time while the oozy egg gave it a smooth texture to every bite.    Service overall was welcoming and quick.  I didn't get a chance to order and coffee, but definitely and next time for me and Bo Bites recommendation! - Enjoy!"}
{"text":"This has become one of our new favorite breakfast places in Phoenix, The Vovomeena! They have unique food combinations that are delicious, a very comfortable dinning experience and their name is fun to say ~ Vovomeena.  Say it with me; \"Vovomeena\" :-)  zee food ~ My fave is the Mexican Benedict or the BMOC.  They both are excellent choices!  The Mexican Benedict has great favor and textures with poached eggs a top of the english muffins with some chorizo and a great hollandaise.  The BMOC is pockchop/waffle/eggies and a portuguese donut (not made by a portugese person nor flown in from Portugal because I asked..) is a flavor-fest!   My son loves the Pain Perdu which is banana bread pudding french toast with the most amazing whiskey caramel sauce and a side of bacon or sausage.  I like it as well! The coffee is great and they provide you with a to-go cup when you're ready.    zee place to eat ~ it's nicely decorated with plenty of seating despite this place is so small.  They have a few larger tables, which provide you an opportunity to dine with others you may or may not know :-)  The staff is very friendly and they are always ready to help you find their morning moonshine.    It's a great little place for breakfast.  I hope to see you there some day soon!  I'll save you a spot at the end of the big table :-)"}
{"text":"I only tried two dishes here, but I felt like both were extremely heavy. In glancing through the menu, it seemed that most of the dishes bordered on the heavy, carb-full side of brunch. Not that there's anything wrong with that, and brunch food tends to be heavy in general, but I felt that Vovomeena definitely took that to a new extreme with the dishes I tried. They were very unbalanced, and I didn't feel like finishing the meal after a few bites because of how one-dimensional the flavors felt.   Vovomeena is located in a small plaza with a shared parking lot between a few restaurants. Parking can be insane during the lunchtime rush, but it's not usually too hard to find a spot. Tables felt somewhat sticky to me, and unfortunately there were quite a few flies hovering around (not that that's the restaurant's fault). The mechanism is order first at the counter, grab drinks as they're made at the counter, and then find self seating. Service at the counter was short, although the waiter manning the tables was nice and checked on us a few times.  Iced cold brew: This was a far cry from the fragrant, nutty cold brew coffee that the menu promised. I much prefer the Starbucks cold brew even, and this was very watered down and bland in comparison. The cup was also half ice, which I wasn't a fan of.  HMOC: waffle topped with pork loin and donut. This combination was very interesting, and I hadn't really had anything like it before. My main issue with this dish, as I've mentioned above, is how it was heavy upon heavy upon heavy. The waffle was sweet and syrupy, then on top the pork loin was salty and dense (it tasted more like ham so I was surprised), and finally there's a fried donut on top that was also very rich. I felt that there wasn't a component to alleviate some of the richness of the dish, so it was hard to enjoy after the first few bites. I actually preferred that the pork had been cured or marinated before, as the saltiness similar to ham could combat the sweetness of the waffle and donut a little.   Pain Perdu: I know this is a Yelp favorite, but it was really just banana bread smothered in syrup. There wasn't really anything that suggested french toast to me, and paying $10+ for two slices of banana bread soaked in syrup with half a sliced banana on top didn't feel worth it to me. The banana bread was also really, really sweet, which was then exacerbated by the syrup on top. The whole dish was so sweet that it made the banana taste bland.   I was lured in by the amazing reviews, but I don't know that I'd return for a second visit."}
{"text":"We saw Vovomeena was listed as the best breakfast in the neighborhood by the New Times so figured we'd give it a Sunday morning go. What a great place! It's hidden behind the Five Guys in that center so we'd never even seen it before. We were fortunate that it was not as busy as some other Yelpers have experienced and,showing up during a lull, the coffee bar guy even came over and discussed the menu with us.   Great service, great food, love the atmosphere and coffee. And all just an easy bike ride down 5th Ave. Sinfully delicious but a worthwhile breakfast bookmark."}
{"text":"Vovomeena means Grandma Meena. And if this is how Grandma Meena always cooks, then I would kindly ask to be adopted, immediately.   We came here for brunch to take advantage of the beautiful patio weather. I had two eggs over easy, taters, buttermilk biscuit and sausage. He had .. get this... Banana bread pudding french toast with some kind of whiskey sauce?! Decadence to the extreme. The French toast was delicious, but you need to have a serious sweet tooth to be able to put the whole thing down.   Everything we ate had delicious flavor and looked great too, good portion size and all.   The style of service is very simple, you order and pay at the counter, they give you a numbered card and bring your food to wherever you choose to sit.   There is also a coffee bar where they have Japanese Cold Drip coffee! Exactly what we need in the sweltering Arizona summer.  Keep in mind that they close at 1:30."}
{"text":"Yummy!!! If I could do 4 and a half I would! I had a Mexican Benedict with hot coffee, the boyfriend had waffles, bacon and potatoes. Only thing that was just okay were the potatoes.. I think they should use Yukon potatoes. This is also dog friendly, I'll make sure to bring my little baby next time This restaurant is for sure is in my top 5 for brunch"}
{"text":"Finally made it to this little gem that is on the corner of 7th Ave and McDowell.  Wow, it was so good!  I would call this counter service, you order at the register than take your table.  After that your food is brought to you and everything else is just like a regular restaurant.  The menu is made up of the normal breakfast and brunch items and then the other items are things that you normally wouldn't think of but of boy, did they sure look and smell good when they went by us.  Our party had the famous biscuits and gravy -YUMMY; Blackstone Scramble - YUMMY and then the Banging Pocket - YUMMY!!  Next time I'm getting the Pain Perdu because it looked and smelled so good.  The service is top notch and everything was very clean.  They have indoor and outdoor seating available and dogs are welcomed on the patio. I would highly recommend Vovomeena for breakfast/brunch."}
{"text":"Mexican Benedict!!!! It's a must everything about it is perfect!! I have gotten it twice delish!!!"}
{"text":"We love this place! The food is always delicious and the coffee is some of the best in town! If you like iced coffee the Japanese cold drip is to die for. Vovomeena is a hidden gem and you have to try it!"}
{"text":"Vovomeena lived up to the hype.  I had been eyeballing their menu for some time and was really looking forward to trying the pain perdu (banana bread pudding French toast) and WOW, it was awesome. The only issue I had was that I wanted more and more.  The family all enjoyed their meals and had no complaints to note. I would definitely go back in hopes the cooks make a mistake and make my portion twice the size."}
{"text":"Great coffee. Great food. The iced japanese coffee is something else. I don't know of any other place that has such a thing. The Mexican Benedict is very good. It has just the right amount of spice, and the eggs are runny with a great hollandaise.  Just what I want."}
{"text":"We decided to check this place out after seeing how many awesome reviews they had. We had the Mexican Benedict, Orchard French Toast & iced coffees! Everything was delicious! I'd definitely recommend checking this place out!"}
{"text":"Being away from family on Easter isn't always easy.  Missing the home cooked goodness and the niece and nephews hunting eggs.  So I was thankful for my two sistas from other mistas for joining me for brunch.  This place is super cute and absolutely delish! I ordered the Mexican Benedict.  Sopes instead of bread...chorizo, cilantro and a lovely poached egg with hollandaise sauce! Served with their spuds...I added their arugula salad and dropped that on top of the benedict...perfection!    This place is great! I know we will be back and I'll definitely have the banana bread pudding french toast my friend got...that ish was off the chain!"}
{"text":"Second trip to Phoenix meant a 2nd trip to Vovomeena. Everything we have had is tasty. Chilis in my johnny cakes? Sure!  Not my usual breakfast but the flavor combos are so tasty. Pain perdu made from banana pudding bread?  Oh yeah!!  The coffee is solid too. My plan is to return often enough to try each item on the menu. It's that good."}
{"text":"This breakfast place is adorable on the inside and tucked away. The food was AMAZING and the service was even better! It was busy when we arrived but the wait after we ordered was short! We will definitely be going back! Order the 'banging pocket'. Absolutely the best breakfast place in Phoenix!  Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"We were visiting from Hawaii and found this place through Yelp.  We arrived there 40 minutes before closing and it was not crowded. The place is very nice. The menu is simple. You place your order at the serving counter and they bring your food to your table. There is a separate counter where they craft your coffee drink. I ordered  the b.m.o.c. and was not disappointed. The pork chop was tender and tasty. It was a first for me to have it with a waffle and it was delicious. My family members had the Mexican Benedict which was very good; Wilcox avenue and classic egg sandwich which were all very delicious. I would definitely eat here again."}
{"text":"Love this place! The BYOC is amazing! Best pork chop I've ever had. The Mexican Benedict is good, the Banger is good, it's all yummy!"}
{"text":"I got in here pretty early on a Sunday morning and didn't have to wait at all. The menu is different from a lot of breakfast places and I appreciate their creativity.  I went with the 3 Sisters omelet. The ingredients were tasty and I really liked how fluffy the eggs were.  Coffee and service were good as well."}
{"text":"First off, the seating here is super confusing. It is not clear what you should do when you enter and no employee helped direct us what to do.  It was cramped and awkward as it was very busy and we did not know where to stand before and after ordering our food, we were basically hovering over the people trying to eat around us. After we got our food, it was not worth the wait.  It was lukewarm/cold, lacking sauce, potatoes were undercooked and under seasoned.  The bread was dry and flavorless. To top it all off, it was expensive."}
{"text":"My sister took me here while visiting from WA and I must say I haven't had French toast this tasty in a long time! It was done with challah bread and topped with sliced apples and honey mascarpone! It was so delightful!"}
{"text":"From the whiskey caramel on the pain perdu, the spuds on the side, to the arugula leaves in the savory crepes and the amazing locally crafted coffee, I have to give it Vovomeena!!!! You guys are an outstanding breakfast place. Keep doing what you do! I shall be back."}
{"text":"I got the Mexican Benedict and ordered the eggs over medium. Lets just say my babe and I fought over the last bite and to her quote she did not remember her meal. Which she did not finish and my plate was clean! THANK YOU! And we will be back!"}
{"text":"Cold brew coffee was good but I hated the donuts. I was expecting malasadas like I had in Hawaii, but they were nothing like it. AND they were served room temp!  SO disappointed! 1 star for the donuts and 4 for the coffee."}
{"text":"So I came for the first time today and it was PACKED at 11-11:30am. Tip: do NOT come on Sunday mornings around this time (maybe better next Sunday?)  I got my food at a pretty reasonable time considering the amount of guests here. Was told the Portuguese donut wasn't available anymore and was kinda disappointed but when they brought out my food I had to ask if that was it or not. Apparently I lucked out and got it anyhow.   4 stars because of the great tasting food. Solid amount of food to definitely feed you and your girlfriend (bmoc at least).  Come give em a try! But sit inside and make sure you don't have a crowd of over 2 because seating is limited."}
{"text":"AWESOME!!!!! I got the Wilcox Avenue and a waffle....the customer service was top notch, I actually made a mistake and ordered a dish that didn't come with a waffle, and was given the waffle for free....(can't beat free)"}
{"text":"Came into town for training and stopped in for breakfast. I was not disappointed. The food was delicious, and the staff was great!"}
{"text":"Wow every weekend vovomeena gets lots of love from all the locals from the valley.   Every one is so nice and attentive.  The food is amazing good. Try the 3 sisters is delicious  good."}
{"text":"Great experience,super fast service. My wife and I saw this restaurant on Check Please Arizona last night. Very quiet and quaint place and Super good food and a good serving size as well. If you are a light eater you my want share."}
{"text":"I told the manager I have gluten and dairy allergies before ordering and he recommended a couple options I could do. I ended up ordering the Mexican Benedict with no tortilla. They bring me my plate with my food on top of, you guessed it, tortillas. Because it was on my food, I couldn't eat anything except the potatoes and left the actual dish untouched. Waste of $13.00 on breakfast - who knew listening to someone's order was so difficult?"}
{"text":"This is the spot for breakfast or brunch. Highly recommended"}
{"text":"This is a terrific breakfast spot in downtown Phoenix if you want somewhere small and cozy with delicious comfort food (and great coffee!). A lifelong Phoenix resident took me here and swore by it, so I came with an open mind despite a difficult parking situation in the small attached lot. Upon entering you wait in line to place your order and I chose the biscuits and gravy as well as the unlimited hot coffee before taking our seat.   The coffee itself was great and worthy of any boutique coffee shop in LA! While I got the unlimited hot coffee (for only $3!) my friend got the cold brew sampler which was a unique experience if you're a cold brew lover! Out of her four cold brews she really liked three of them, so don't go into it planning to love each one but if you want to try new things it's a great option.  When our food arrived I was blown away by the biscuits and gravy. As many here have said, they're incredibly rich and indulgent but are the perfect treat if you're craving something heavy on the carbs and cream! The menu is expansive, as well, so next time I'm in Phoenix I'll certainly come back to try something new!"}
{"text":"This is a perfectly fine spot for brunch. The food is good, but I think it's a bit overpriced, and the menu is really limited. I've never been wow-ed by what I've had there, but with every not-so-positive review, I always like to say that I might just not have tried the right thing.  Seriously though, the service and coffee are always good. We'd have to be pretty close for me to tell you I didn't want to eat there."}
{"text":"Oh. Em. Vee.   This was delicious. New favorite breakfast place obsession has commenced with this lovely little gem. Recommend the Savory Crepes (perfect amount of saucy goodness + cheese + egg) and the johnnycakes. Going to try the three sisters strata next."}
{"text":"It was good breakfast, not sure if it is better than Matt's or Snooze, but comparable. The bacon was good. I wasn't wild about the coffee and they only had one, the others were out. It was extremely busy and we sat outside. I am interested in going back to try something other than breakfast."}
{"text":"We were looking for something different for breakfast and stumbled upon this little gem. Very modern decor and clean!  This is a order at the counter and sit type of place. We like t usually sit and figure it out in the mornings..but no complaints. Simple menu We loved our breakfast... so you will see us again sometime soon"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I were looking for new breakfast places to try and decided to check Vovomeena out. The reviews were off the charts, especially for the Pain Perdu.  To make an unbiased assessment, I refused to order the pain perdu the first time. My logic being: how good can a place REALLY be if they only serve one fantastic item? So, I ordered the Blackstone scramble while my boyfriend decided to continue his search for the best biscuits and gravy.  The food was as fabulous as I had read. The biscuits and gravy were some of the best he had ever had and I made a personal oath to come try the pain perdu. That mission was completed today and I concur with all the positive reviews. I was sincerely sad, and disappointed in myself, for not being able to finish what was on my plate.   We will be coming back!"}
{"text":"What a great place tucked behind a parking lot on 7th Ave & McDowell.  As you walk in grab a menu and then place your order.    The menu is short and sweet.  The home fries are the real deal with huge chunks of of tomato and cilantro.  We were handed a number as I turned around I saw this cute coffee stand.  The coffee was unique, against the wall were glass cylinders that dripped coffee slowly into larger cylinders.  I was told this is the new wave of coffee making.  Okay, then I need a cup right now...  I coffee was good, not great but good.  Here comes the brunch.... my husband ordered the French toast... wow.... it was definitely delicious! I got the tortilla espinola. It was yummmy....  Vovomeena is a great breakfast/brunch place.  That's what they do and they do it well....."}
{"text":"Good brunch spot in Phoenix!  Went during the weekday, so it wasn't crowded at all. There is parking on both sides of the building, and it's plentiful.   Inside has a nice, relaxing ambiance to it. Again, it wasn't crowded when we went, but I can imagine it may not be as relaxing if it got really busy inside. I must also say that the restroom was really nice, which is always a plus.  The service was fine. Nothing to complain about there.  The food was good. The menu is small, but at the same time has a good selection to choose from if that makes sense. We had the johnnycakes with turkey sausage and the blackstone scramble with flour tortilla. The johnnycakes were really good. Love that corn in them. The sweet rice was also a great side with that. The turkey sausage was a little dry, but had a nice spice to it. The scramble was solid. The pork shoulder was cooked nicely and was a perfect size for the scramble. The prices were also very reasonable for the portions.  Overall, good spot to grab some breakfast/brunch. Reasonable prices, solid food, generous portions."}
{"text":"This place is amazing!! Best French toast I ever had. And the people are very nice. Food is incredible."}
{"text":"I have been here twice now. I anxiously await my next visit !! :) I have been able to try the johnny cakes ( perfection ! Better than mine -pat pat ) the biscuits and gravy (oh my wow ! So sausagyyy and herby and creamy and wow !) the b.m.o.c. (way more that I dreamt it would be, tender smokey pork, sweet strong vanilla waffle make magic together) and the pancakes and bacon (right on). Their potatoes are outstanding. Their coffee is wonderful. The customer service is caring. The decor is nice. Great spot !"}
{"text":"If its a difficult task for you to figure out the ordering and seating arrangements at this fantastic breakfast spot, I suggest you never travel. A busy morning restaurant or cafés in a large metropolitan city will scramble your hungry brain even more than  a brunch outing at Vovomeena!  My favorite dishes are Mexican Benedict, Pain Perdu, and Wilcox Avenue. All require a large glass of Japanese cold brew, which is the best refreshing coffee drink on a weekend morning! I highly recommend. Skip the usual creamer as the taste is not bitter. Yum!"}
{"text":"Nice indoor/outdoor, industrial/rustic, bustling atmosphere.  Very friendly, welcoming staff..with fast service.  I tried the Japanese cold brew flight... A-mazing! The flavors in the flight are rotated..today was star cardomen, orange ginger and Black and Tan. I went with the blackstone scramble for brunch...just the right amount of food, fresh ingredients and a killer tortilla (I don't normally eat tortillas but this one I couldn't pass up).   If you are downtown, I would highly recommend...please build a sister location in downtown Gilbert ;-)"}
{"text":"The Mexican omelette is pretty good. It is a little spicy so be aware of that. The bread is also a little different unlike normal Eggs Benedict. Hubby got the pancakes and bacon and it was also very good typical diner pancakes."}
{"text":"B.M.O.C Review  Creamy deliciousness in my mouth with a side of food coma. This thing was the bomb dot com. Be warned, it will end your day. Smoked pork chop topped with a waffle, two fried eggs and a Portuguese donut all smothered in apple maple syrup. I was full about 2/3 of the way through this madness but  finished like a champ. 3 cups of coffee later I was able to avoid the food coma but I was still stuffed from breakfast around 8pm that same day. Give it a go homey!"}
{"text":"Great place for breakfast! Awesome combinations, friendly fast service! Omelet was super good and so were the pancakes.  We will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Okay, so we are in Phoenix to pick up  breakfast with our guest who is leaving that day and we are on our way from Peoria, AZ to take her to the airport  and we want her to have the Matt's Big Breakfast experience and..........yep, you guessed it, 40 minute line to wait in, so we fell into this place..........thanks to other yelp users who rated this high and nearby.  Well, we are here to tell you, this should be the place they are standing in line for, it's that good.  From the moment you walk in and notice the delectable dishes on the tables of the customers, you know you've stepped into something very unique for the palate.  Then, you pick up a menu and you know you aren't in Kansas anymore...........the names of the dishes are different, the ingredients are different, the choices are creative, and about the best coffee I've tasted.  It looks like a factory, but it delivers like nonconformity.  What to have?  we tried the chorizo benedict, the savory crepes, and the grilladas and if we had tummy room, we would have tried more.  Sufficeth it to say, we won't be standing in line for Matt's next time ---- we'll set our sights and our gps to this place!  Well done, vovomeena!"}
{"text":"Came in for breakfast ordered their Benedict and I thought it was absolutely terrible the owner of the restaurant looked at me like I was crazy cuz he said so many people love it he then gave me an order of biscuits and gravy which I will say were absolutely amazing I did like those my girlfriend ordered some type of corn pancakes and they were very good as well the coffee was nice and strong and honestly we beat the crowds so I can't complain too much it was a great stop on our way back to California"}
{"text":"Love the vibe and smell of the place!  I love to smell coffee, but I am not a drinker.  I got their green tea.  Pretty good.  Came with friends and wanted to try the Japanese ice coffee.  I would come back for a bite, next time!"}
{"text":"I don't know why, it took me longer time to get the food, but the food overall is great! Coffee is okay. (Not that excellent.) Environment is quiet and lovely."}
{"text":"I wanted something different for brunch. I got the sausage in pita, it was very good. Nice clean restaurant, priced well. I'll be back."}
{"text":"One of the best breakfasts I have had and I have been to many unique places.  The portion was a little slim but the taste and quality outstanding.  Just a cute and unique little place in an older and rejuvenated part of the inner city.  Great and friendly service too ! I will return"}
{"text":"I think for those of us who came in on the wknd of 9/30 the place was too busy and they still need time to figure out the kinks like others said. It was busy, which is a good sign, but also they were running short on the menu so I wasnt able to get the grillades just yet. Thats what Ive been wanting to try. I did have the BMOC, but it didnt excite me like some of the other reviews. I did have the pain perdu a week prior when it wasnt crowded, which is the banana bread pudding french toast and I have to say those were excellent and by far my fave thing I have tried there. My hubby had the boxty and mexican eggs benedict(by the way to other comment who mentioned, they had Sriracha and Cholulah the day we came in) Hubby said a piece of toast would go well with the Mexican Benedict to help finish up all the stuff on the plate, other then that he liked it, and hes a big fan of the Japanese Coffee also and said he probably wont go to Starbucks again either. The Boxty was interesting, but I was too busy eating my banana bread pudding french toast with Whiskey Caramel Sauce. The food is very rich and Ive found Im stuffed and cant even finish my plate, so Im usually taking some to go. If you are coming with a large group on a busy day you will probably have to sit outside at the big long counter tables. Most of the seating inside is for groups of 2-4. Very happy to get more variety in the strip mall! And yes the manager is out speaking to customers and was carrying food out along with the staff. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Had brunch with a co-worker here today. Food was delicious and flavorful. Excellent for brunch. Mexican Egg Benedict was phenomenal! Their espresso machine was broken but the Japanese Cold Brews were nice and strong. You get to add your own sugars and creamers to your taste at the bar area.  We told the barista it was our first time dining there and he gave us a quick tour and break down of the restaurant. So, you grab a menu and when you're ready, place your order at the register. If you order coffee or tea you pick it up at the bar. You get to pick your own seats and they'll bring your food out to you.  Although quaint, the place has a very unique look; comfortable but sophisticated. There's also a patio sitting area if you chose to sit outdoors. The employees were kind and helpful when we asked about their recommendations. They were also attentive in offering/providing condiments/extras and clearing our table.   Definitely going back, definitely a new favorite!"}
{"text":"Found this fantastic breakfast on Yelp. Great food, great service. Big fluffy pancakes!! Groovy atmosphere. Loved it. We'll be back to try some of stuff he more creative stuff on the menu."}
{"text":"We found this place on Yelp. It was off the beaten path from the convention center. When in cities for conventions, I like to venture to more local spots for good food. This place didn't disappoint.   I really liked the food here. I wouldn't eat here often because most of the food was on the heavier side, but it was really good. If you want pancakes, this place has really good ones.  They also have freshly squeezed orange juice.   The food came out fairly quickly.   Definitely go here for good breakfast."}
{"text":"GET HERE NOW...NOW!!! Great food! It will look like there is no seating when you're in line on the weekend, but by the time you get your food it will be open TRUST ME. Try the Mexican benedict...life changing. Cinnamon rolls? Fogettaboutit!"}
{"text":"Went here with a pretty big group. We had a reservation and the table was ready. The food came out pretty quickly after we ordered and it was all very good. Those who had coffee said it was delicious coffee. My food was good nothing spectacular, I had the Wilcox Avenue. The sausage was yummy, wheat toast was good and the jelly (I assume homemade) was awesome.  I would certainly go back and try more items on the menu."}
{"text":"Our first time here and it was absolutely delicious ! I had the Mexican Benedict, what a unique take on Eggs benedict ! My husband had the Banging Pocket and enjoyed it ! Don't forget to top off your plate with their Portuguese donut !"}
{"text":"Great food. Fun atmosphere. Friendly service. This is one of my new Sunday brunch favorites."}
{"text":"This is tucked away and easy to miss but it should not be! We had such a great breakfast here the other day. I think I may have found by new favorite place for brunch. Definitely recommend!!"}
{"text":"This was a spectacular breakfast! The line was out the door when we arrived, but I liked how well-organized it all was. I didn't mind standing in line knowing I was going to be ordering at the end of it, and loved how they made sure tables weren't occupied until you had a number for your food. It really kept people moving without worrying about holding a table. Loved their patio seating too.  I had a really hard time deciding what to eat because there were so many delicious sounding, and looking (yes, I was that person creeping on other's breakfasts as we were standing in line). I finally settled on their biscuits and gravy because that's one of my favorite breakfast foods- it was so delicious!! Definitely want to try their Mexican benedict next time I'm in town.  Loved their Japanese cold-brewed coffee as well! Smooth, rich and totally hit the spot!  The owner, I think, was working the register when we ordered and he was so friendly and welcoming- that kind of attention goes a long way. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Vovomeena has great food and a friendly staff. The food is very reasonably priced for the quality."}
{"text":"They have done it again.  Great concept, great food, great building, great staff, and pricing is just right.    If you are looking to break the Corporate Food Chain monotony of 7th Ave and McDowell then Vovomeena is where to go.  Delicious local food and excellent coffee selections.  I can not pick a favorite on the menu, but can say that everything will be sure to not disappoint, so you are safe to close your eyes, point, and try it."}
{"text":"The Johnnycakes (corn and chile cakes with prickly pear syrup) were delicious and different. I loved this sweet and savory dish!"}
{"text":"Adorable restaurant with great atmosphere. The food is affordable and well made. I wasn't particularly blown away by my breakfast but I will go back to try something else on the menu. Parking is a bit of a challenge but it's a perfectly fine place to have breakfast."}
{"text":"Excellent service, food and coffee/latte were delicious.  Had the French toast and chorizo hollonadaise, both pretty good. Staff is super friendly. Would highly recommend."}
{"text":"Food snob Here in Phoenix from LA. This place, the food, the service, the atmosphere, the lattes, the coffee, the cappuccino - everything was excellent and satisfying.  Will definitely come back when I'm Phoenix again.  Try it. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Easily one of the best spots in Arizona if not the entire US. Amazing food done right, great atmosphere. Amazing customer service. Can't say enough good things about this place."}
{"text":"Strike 1 - Being out of the 'jug-o'coffee'/pitcher of iced coffee, I had to order 3 separate coffees for my group and it was definitely pricier. I was expecting the server to offer a comparable price for the 3 coffees since the restaurant made an excuse about the \"pitchers not being delivered\" but I guess my expectations were too high. This left a bitter taste in my mouth (not in the good coffee way), and there's also no refill. Since I run on caffeine, there just wasn't enough there to wake me up.   Strike 2 - I ordered the blackstone scramble, and the eggs tasted absolutely bland. I'm always looking for a kick in my breakfast to help me wake up (sensing a theme here?)...it just didn't hit that note for me despite the delicious description on the menu.  I should not need to drown my food in tabasco for flavor.   Strike 3 - I can see the ordering system working to improve efficiency, but in this case, since there were no designated waiters, there was no motivation to assist/clean tables. I didn't see many patrons leaving tip, and this just creates a no win situation on both sides.  And I'm out"}
{"text":"Awesome breakfast...I had the The Wilcox and everythi g was cooked to perfection. My husband had the biscuits and gravy and the gravy was very savory and the eggs were cooked just right. The porportions are huge, neither of us could finish. The staff was very attentive and friendly. We loved the atmosphere."}
{"text":"Stopped here with my sis on the way back from the airport. Nice quaint little place. The food wasn't spectacular but nice options and definitely a better experience than the local chains like IHOP and Denny's. A little pricey would be my only complaint - $38 for 2 breakfasts and a coffee drink. Still it's definitely worth trying."}
{"text":"Fantastic brunch spot! We chose this place at random for our group of 3 to grab brunch on a Sunday around noon. It was busy but we got a table within 5 minutes of ordering. Everyone loved the food! My husband had biscuits and gravy - he said it was incredible, he just wished the portion was bigger (much smaller than your typical biscuit & gravy portion). I had the bangin' pocket (essentially a breakfast burrito, but in a pita). It was delicious, and great portion size. Wish I would have tried their coffee. I can't wait to return!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere and staff are REALLY nice, pleasant, great vibe, clean, with a well thought-out menu.  The food menu sounded really nice, but honestly the food was just meh.  We are both spoiled because I cook everything from scratch all the time, so the best way I can explain it is that they had lots of great concepts (using banana bread instead of regular French toast, for example), but the food itself wasn't super flavorful.  The individual ingredients like the meat  and bread used in the benedict could have been tastier.  I loved the fried potatoes that came as a side dish for breakfast.  The coffee was just okay and the espresso wasn't good. I think that most people would probably love it, but if you're an extreme foodie, or maybe it was just us, we wouldn't return."}
{"text":"Five stars for sure and can't wait to come back and try something new! Came here on a Saturday morning and the line was out the door but it honestly didn't take too long. Maybe 15-20 min to order. We sat down and got our food really fast there. As you're in line to order you're right outside the kitchen do you can see how fast they're working and getting all these dishes together. They know what they're doing! I got the Mexican Benedict because I saw everyone talking about it here on Yelp. Let me tell you, I was not disappointed!! Perfect portion size and the flavor was so good!! My husband got the banana pudding French toast, the name on the menu was something different, don't remember what it was but his dish was just as good! So much flavor in every single bite. Everything was bomb, can't wait to come back and try something else on the menu!"}
{"text":"Always wondered what this place was and I am so glad I tried it out. My boyfriend and I went on a Saturday morning. We didn't have to wait to order, which isn't the norm at most breakfast places downtown on the weekend. The staff was very friendly when we arrived. We both ordered the biscuits and gravy. The food arrived to our table quick, less than five minutes after ordering. The portion was large and it tasted great. I enjoyed the atmosphere and really liked the coffee bar. I would definitely recommend this place to friends. We will be back soon!"}
{"text":"Great brunch place and not as expensive as what you would find in New York! My recommendations are the Johnnycakes and the b.m.o.c.  Johnnycakes (Two corn and chile cakes, prickly pear maple syrup, sweet rice) - My favorite of what we ordered. The cakes tasted like thin crispy cornbread with whole corn kernels throughout the pancake. The syrup was on the flowery side. Add a side of potatoes and this was a perfect breakfast.  b. m. o. c. (Massive Smoked Pork Chop, waffle, 2 eggs, Portuguese donut) - The waffle itself was soggy, but the pork chop was juicy and massive as advertised. It was similar to ham and it combined well with apple compote. The donut tasted like a fried fritter. I recommend ordering this.  Pain Perdu (Banana bread pudding french toast, whiskey caramel) - The banana bread was too sweet and too soggy. The whiskey caramel added more unnecessary sweetness. Order this only if you have a huge sweet tooth. I loved the crispy side of potatoes though.   Biscuits and Gravy (Buttermilk Biscuit, Hector's White Sausage Gravy, Two Eggs - The sausage had a somewhat spicy kick. Biscuits were fluffy. Eat this dish while warm because the gravy becomes too thick and viscous.  Order at the cash register and they'll bring you the food to the table. To get drinks, order/retrieve them from the drinks counter. Overall, I enjoyed this place and if I lived here I would frequent this place often."}
{"text":"If you are looking for a hearty breakfast on a Saturday morning because you are going to conquer a 2 hour hike or run, then \"hell yes\" - go to Vovomeena.    I decided to go with Yelp's recommendations of the BMOC.  This thing was insane!  A waffle, then a pork chop, two eggs, maple syrup and some kind of fruit, and just as a little \"cherry on top\" for your breakfast sundae, they give you a small donut hole with some powder.    It was quite tasty!  However, it was too much for me to take.  It would practically take two of me to finish it all. Luckily, I was set to hike Squaw Peak right after.  So I didn't feel too guilty getting down with that kind of breakfast.  It actually gave me the extra motivation and boost of energy I needed.   On a side note, the iced coffee was a little too strong for my blood.  I'm sure other coffee drinkers would love it."}
{"text":"Excellent food! You wait in line FIRST, order at the counter, find a seat, and the food is brought to you. On weekends the line gets pretty long, but it goes pretty quickly.  Everything I've tried has been very good."}
{"text":"A bit hard to find the first time as it is nestled behind other businesses.  Drive around the block and park behind in the large common parking lot.  Although the inside of the building is narrow the tables is laid out perfectly and the decor is eclectic.  There is also a very large area in the back for sitting.  They ask you not to barney a table until you've ordered and believe it or not the system works.    Waiting in line to order you can see them preparing the food; yummy.  Small menu but choices I've not seen elsewhere. I got the tortilla espanola and the hubby got the mexican benedict.  Both were cooked well and were tasty.  Not earth shattering but good.  When they dropped our breakfasts they asked if we wanted condiments and it took him a full 5 minutes (while the breakfast cooled) before he came back with them.  I'd suggest they carry the items on their person - only complaint."}
{"text":"Goodness on a plate with a side of love and sunshine. Our first time was amazing. There was a line out the door so we had plenty of time to select our entrées. I selected the BMOC and my husband ordered the biscuits and gravy. To drink I had the fresh orange juice and took a taste of my husbands cold pressed coffee flight. My BMOC was salty and savory and sweet and amazing. The flavor a really worked well together, it was a fabulous \"cheat\" meal. The biscuits and gravy were the best I ever tasted, ever! The biscuits were fluffy and yummy and the gravy needed no additional seasoning, we asked for Chalula hot sauce and decided it was fine without. Cannot wait to go back."}
{"text":"The waffle I had was delicious. Even though I wasn't able to substitute the spuds for something else, I was still left impressed. I want to bring all of my closest friends and family to this place. I'll be at this same spot next Sunday."}
{"text":"Everything was so damn good. My husband order the banging pocket and said \"I'm so full, but it's so good I can't stop eating it.\" Be prepared for a bit of a wait. Very dog friendly!"}
{"text":"A very trendy eatery. Coffee is on another level! Food is great but not fantastic as far as flavor goes."}
{"text":"The b.m.o.c was really good. This breakfast was different , fresh, and innovative. Enjoyed it. This place is legit!"}
{"text":"You know you found a good place when you wanna come back like everyday and try everything on the menu and this place is just that. The restaurant is really small but still comfy, we were greeted the moment we walked in, and once we ordered and got seated our food arrived in less then 5 minutes it seemed. I ordered the breakfast sandwich and my boyfriend had the waffle eggs and sausage. Everything was delicious especially the potatoes! Such a cool place and I can't wait to go back to try more!"}
{"text":"First impressions were good! Excellent esthetics of the place.. Good vibes good music.. Costumer service was not the best. I'm sure they were just busy, but I felt little to no acknowledgment that I was there or a paying customer.   FOOD IS ON POINT.  I would recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"Food is great, the tortilla española could be improved, it's one of Spain's most popular dishes, yet so simple and it doesn't need to be over elaborated, 5 ingredients: Potatoes, eggs, onions, salt and olive oil, how can you go wrong? They need just a little of a fifth ingredient; passion. Service is confusing, if you sit at a table they move you because you have to order first, it throws people off and it gets annoying, I left my stuff at a table and they sat someone at that table, I understand the rule, but I guess I really don't like that one. Having said that, it's a great spot; different!"}
{"text":"I've been meaning to come in since I had my bday dinner at How do you Roll? Finally made it in with the fam!   I was super excited to try the Japanese cold brew. We had heard awesome things and boy, it did not disappoint! We had a flight of 3 different kinds - lemon jalapeño, med, and ginger cardamom. They were all delicious. The first one you could really taste the lemon, not so much the jalapeño, the med was nice and bold, and the ginger cardamom was my FAV. Nice and spicy.  Note: cold brew has MORE caffeine in it!  For food we got the BMOC and the Pain Perdu. Both were excellent. The pork on the BMOC was nice and moist and smoky. The Portuguese donut was fluffy and not too sweet. Pain Perdu is just SINFUL. Banana bread pudding French toast with whiskey caramel sauce?! Oh you must. You'll gain 5 lbs but you just have to do it.  My only gripe is that both dishes were swimming in sauce. It was too much. My waffle was soggy on the BMOC because it was drowning in syrup. And it whiskey caramel sauce is so rich, they could really just drizzle it on there and it would suffice. Next time I will order the syrup and sauce on the side! I suggest you do the same.  Overall, really good experience. Customer service was warm and friendly. Mostly hipster crowd but there were families there too so we felt totally comfortable as well. Will return!"}
{"text":"Amazing breakfast. The food is really good. Definitely a spot I'll be going back to. And I don't even care for breakfast."}
{"text":"Updated review, I went back per manager request for second try, food much much better, had a grand experience. Not a fan of of the order at the counter and still not a fan of the prepackaged orange juice in plastic cups and odd coffee flight in plastic jugs. Nonetheless the food and drink was spot on.    Great place, almost 5 stars, I'll start with cons then pros:  Cons: Order at bar, my personal preference this takes away ambiance. It causes you to rush your order, keeps you from ordering more, awkward if you are a visitor from Out of town. You can see into the kitchen which could be cool but this kitchen is not the prettiest, looks messy. The place is awkwardly run, folks running around all over, coffee bar has plastic jugs of brewed coffee, be cooler if the coffee was in glass dispensers or something classier. Dirty tables, I wouldn't care so much but if you are required to self seat you have to navigate them Coffee bar is messy, ugly glass fridge showing off messy storage Going back to kitchen which is in clear view, messy messy, bizarre, empty boxes, crap all over floor, food supplies etc. OJ is prepared and stored in plastic cups, I personally would Prefer to get my OJ in a glass. Food although good, seemed a bit messy when served, I saw into the kitchen as mentioned above and the chefs were sloppily throwing food onto a plate. I may be the exception but it was nothing like the Yelp pics. I had to carry a large coffee flight, my OJ, a number, my wallet, phone all around searching for a table  Pros: Food tasted good, I had the pork chop on a waffle, it was soaked to death in a syrup, I've been on a low carb diet so it was heaven but had I not I think it should be a tad drier. The chop was basically a ham steak, it was a bit acrid, over cooked on grill and sugars burnt. Coffee flight was good, unique flavor a Easy parking  Overall, a bit satisfied but more so disappointed, been trying to get here for years. I'm a very frequent patron of Tuck Shop, I believe they own or partnered with this place.  I'll return although with lower expectations."}
{"text":"I think this is going to be my go-to spot for breakfast,  A friend who is a semi-regular at Vovomeena and I had a breakfast meeting there at his suggestion. I had the Banging Pocket and loved it.  The food was delivered quickly and the service was attentive."}
{"text":"Vovomeena is great for brunch. Coffee and orange juice is sooo good, I think the orange juice is even hand squeezed."}
{"text":"Awesome breakfast.  Fast service. Great coffee.  Love the location.  Daily specials! What else do you need for a great local breakfast experience?  Maybe a hot date...."}
{"text":"What a hidden gem! We were in from out of town and found this place on yelp. Chef, your food was amazing! It was so hard to decide on what to indulge in. We score with our selection the Johnny Cakes and the Mexican Benedict. Potatoes were to die for. The Arroz de Leche with my Johnny Cakes was the perfect combination of sweet spice and tart with the strawberries. We will definitely make this a must stop when we are in town. Oh I also tried the iced coffee & Caffè vanilla latt, yummy!"}
{"text":"3 visit - first 2 were great / last visit, 3 plates had to be returned ---cold food / might be new cooks / mgmt. did take care of issue . . . .will return . . . .for better results . . ."}
{"text":"Amazing coffee! Food is great! Love having this neighborhood spot!"}
{"text":"Hidden gem!!! Best breakfast we have had in Phoenix. Everything made from scratch and you can see them make your food. Very reasonable prices too."}
{"text":"Ordered the B.M.O.C.. Found this place via @azfoodie's awesome Insta. The dish was a good balance between sweet and salty; a kicked up version of a ham with the added benefit of bbq grill flavor and smoke. Delicious. Comes atop a beautifully made waffle and apple compote, with two eggs (made your way. Mine were a perfect over medium) on top.  They chose a quasi-fast casual dining model, so you pay first and receive your order via server. Ambience is great for foodies, like myself, who enjoy taking photos of everything, and the service was very responsive, efficient and cordial."}
{"text":"Great food!  Different options than the average brunch. Casual atmosphere, no wait for a table due to their set up of ordering before being seated. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I was here for the first time for breakfast and order the only omelette on the menu and it's delicious! I was their with a friend and he order the Mexican egg Benedict he was very happy with it! Nice little place very cozy! I will definitely come back! They serve a yummy local coffee roc2!"}
{"text":"The food was great, the coffee was delicious.  One coffee barista who was beyond rude, made this a horrible first and last experience at this restaurant. The rest of the staff is very pleasant.  Being told whatever because I wanted to ask my friend what she liked, and not given the option of a refund, when they gave me the wrong $10 jar of coffee to go, after spending $32 bucks for my breakfast and to go coffee, is why I will never go back to this place.  Mistakes happen, and I was understanding of that, but it was how the guy in the 80s glasses handled the situation or more so that he didn't.  To the girl in the pink hair and the register guy, thank you both for being polite and friendly."}
{"text":"Small spot with good food. I came specifically for the Banana bread pudding French toast with caramel rum sauce, and it was worth the trip if you like sweet for breakfast. But I noticed a lot of savory items being served."}
{"text":"Hidden gem.  The only thing that supersedes the great service were the homemade biscuits and coffee."}
{"text":"I like it here. The set up is kind of narrow, and it is not a big location/space. I have not encountered this place to be busy, it has just the right amount of \"people flow\" . Artsy feel to it!"}
{"text":"Interesting place.  I have been here a few times, generally because there is nowhere else to go.  The food is good (but weird and not in a way that you would brag to your friends) and the prices a little too high.    It's just okay but I like that I can sit outside and it is cozy and quiet.   Shout-out to Ryan and the vegan woman from Astor House -- you guys are the best."}
{"text":"Can't believe all the other chain clones in this little strip mall are busy when Vovomeena is often relatively calm.  The food is unique and luxurious, the coffee is some of the best around (bottomless cup on the drip variety), the baristas are bad ass, the place is beautiful and interesting, and the prices are not much more than what you'd pay for a fast food meal.  But I guess if you'd rather go to Jersey Mike's (tm), the Habit (tm), Chipotle (tm), etc. etc., knock yourself out.  I'll be here, fat and happy!"}
{"text":"AUGH that waffle/pork chop/egg combination is So good perfectly meaty, sweet and carby  i hear the service can be a bit wonky  but the food is definitely solid  come by for breakfast just don't order a coffee that was the one thing i thought was wildly overpriced"}
{"text":"The BMOC and the Mexican Benedict was nothing short of amazing. The place looks small but they get people through pretty fast. We thought we were gonna be a while because the line was out the door (now after tasting the food I see why). But this was a hit. The orange juice and coffee (morning moonshine) was fresh. Will come back again when in town."}
{"text":"I want to like Vovomeena very much. Their food is mostly good, but there are a huge problem for a restaurant of this quality:  they use LIQUID EGG PRODUCT for their scrambled eggs and omelets. This is what McDonald's uses for their scrambled eggs. Liquid egg product has no place in a high quality establishment. They sacrifice quality for speed. The egg product is one example. The other is that their donuts are fried ahead of time and served cold. They have a cold, greasy taste. Where, if they were fried to order, they would be delicious. Vovomeena wants to be a high end establishment, but their process doesn't match up with that goal. Sometimes there are small sacrifices in speed that are so much worth any extra wait."}
{"text":"This place is not the perfect breakfast experience. It is loud, noisy, small and crowded. At least it was the day I went. However ... upon taking the first bite of their banana bread pudding French toast ... it was as if I was in the restaurant all by myself! It was that good!   Pain Perdu is the name of the dish. I will go back to this place just for another order of that! But it is also fun as the line to order passed directly by the open kitchen. You get to see what all of the dishes look like and even ask the cooks what everything is.  Price: little high Ambience: noisy hustle bustle  Service: quick and friendly  French Toast:  AMAZING!!"}
{"text":"Get the biscuits and gravy. It was the best I've ever had. It was worth the 20 minute line and then some. I'd stand in line for 2 hours foe that if it meant I could have it again."}
{"text":"Absolutely one of the best breakfasts I have ever had, regardless of location. The biscuits and gravy are perfect; hearty white sausage gravy that isn't gloppy, excellent biscuit and exactly-cooked egg to your style. Everything else on the menu looks just as phenomenal, don't think you can make a poor choice here. Bonus: even when busy, their system of seating makes things quick."}
{"text":"I was in Phoenix last weekend visiting the fam, which meant we were definitely out and about on the brunch scene. I've had Vovomeena bookmarked for a couple months or so, and my sister, who lives nearby, assured everyone it was a solid choice.  First, the vibe is super hip, as others have noted. However, I felt very welcomed, even with my parents and a toddler in tow.   The coffee is obviously a main attraction here, and the coffee bar side is worked by a couple guys who seriously know and care about what they are doing. I got a tea latte, since I'm not into coffee, which they had never made, but they were very interested in making helpful suggestions for something I would like.  The food was delicious, and I think between our party of 8, we tried most of the breakfast menu. The Banging Pocket (Shreiner's sausage, duh, it's the only sausage to eat in Phx these days!), the boxty (unique, kinda fruity), johnny cakes (loved! my fave!), mexican benedict, something about 3 sisters that was slightly mexican in style, and the savory crepes....all were really delicious. I even loved the link sausage and I am usually a sausage avoider.  On top of all that, a cool location, and I cannot recomment Vovomeena enough!"}
{"text":"Manager asked us to come out and try it again.    This time was so much better, coffee was as great as ever. Food was great.  My dad loved his meal. People were so friendly.    I appreciate that they put the eggs on the side (instead of on pancakes). Without even being asked.  Now if they could just get more comfortable seating...dad (79 yrs old) (no padding on his butt) and I (with back issues) both had troubles getting up from the hard metal chairs.   But I'll just bring cushions next time. Lol"}
{"text":"Met clients here for a working lunch and everyone was super impressed. Great laid back atmosphere, service was quick and efficient, and all the food was amazing! Will be adding this place to the regular rotation for sure!"}
{"text":"Delicious!! Great coffee and amazing food!! If you haven't been here, you're missing out!!"}
{"text":"Highly recommend. Will definitely be back to try something else. Great value as well. Could charge a lot more for the quality of food.   The B.M.O.C. is a BAMF!!  Great coffee too."}
{"text":"I'm always amazed by the uniqueness of Phoenix and the restaurants that are hidden in little corners, just like Vovomeena. I love the mismatched chairs, the simple order at the counter set up and the various cold pour coffees they offer.      I went for a morning brunch with a group of friends on the past rainy Saturday morning. I was torn between every single thing on the menu because it all looked amazing, but wound up getting the 3 Sisters Omelette. I grabbed an O.J. from the little deli case (tasted fresh squeezed!) and a hot coffee. When I went over to the coffee counter and realized they do in house infused coffees I couldn't resist. I got the ginger infused coffee and my friend got the mint one..I was on cloud nine--and not just from all the caffeine!       We sat outside and got sprinkled on but it was perfect all around. Our food came quickly and my omelette was sensational. With black beans, corn, zucchini, mozzarella, feta and two sausages on the side it was a filling meal, but not over the top. The blend of zucchini and black beans with mozz were delicious, I couldn't get over how amazing one of my friends' Pain Perdu looked though. Whiskey caramel sauce? I mean c'mon. That's my next victim for sure.     The staff was friendly, but busy, and the decor is homey and old school vintage. You'll want to sit and relax for awhile while you people watch and sip your delicious drinks!"}
{"text":"Vovomeena has become a fast favorite of mine... from their coffee to their original breakfast options. The earlier you show, the better, as options can run out towards the afternoon.   The pain perdu is an absolute must. Banana syrupy goodness! I can't break away from the original eggs-potatoes-bacon / sausage breakfast - it's so nice when a restaurant gets it right! (The jam..get the jam.)   Indoor / outdoor seating. Take a menu off the wall and order with the cashier near the kitchen."}
{"text":"The Banging Pocket is by far one of the best breakfast items in Phoenix. No joke. I get cravings for it. That smoked gouda, man. It makes all the difference."}
{"text":"Got the boxty, a jar of coffee (refillable at 10% off), and the day's special lemon tart. The food came out super fast and it was so good. Pancake-sized boxty (2) with shredded apple and a sweet butter on top, paired with two thick-cut slices of bacon.  It's set up where you grab a menu off the wall and go down the line to order at the end. You can see the cooks working without a glass barrier as you stand in line - so don't sneeze.  If you order a jar of coffee at the food counter, the coffee counter further into the restaurant gets a ticket so you pick it up there. It's a plastic-lidded mason jar with a custom label and is filled from jugs in the fridge. It fills about 4 of the ice-filled tumblers/plastic to-go cups and it totally worth the $10. It's super smooth and tasty and not at all bitter. I barely had to put anything into it; I could definitely drink it black and I usually can't with coffee. The boxty was much larger than I expected and the potato vs. sweet apple flavour was distinct from each other and very complimentary, rather than one overpowering the other. The bacon was super tasty too.  The lemon tart was small and plain but still pretty good. I'm not sure what other offerings they have since it said it was the day's \"special\" offering. They also had cookies on the counter and a little cooler of bottled drinks and orange juice at the check out.  A filling breakfast with amazing coffee for just over $20! I will definitely be back!   PS. All the people writing reviews and complaining about lack of vegan choices - there are other restaurants that cater to your special, self-imposed diet. Never, ever expect people to cater to you. It's such a stupid reason to criticize a public place."}
{"text":"Went for breakfast... It was very good. I also got a Portuguese doughnut, which to me was like a fluffier funnel cake, SO DELICIOUS! I can't wait to go back and try more menu items. The service was great, very friendly workers."}
{"text":"The coffee is so good it doesn't need sugar.  The orchard French toast is so good it doesn't need syrup.  Nice staff, food served quickly.  Great place."}
{"text":"Love that is little local spot is a jewel among the chains that surround it on 7th Ave.  It is always busy with activity for breakfast/brunch.  Even though I am not a coffee drinker the Japanese cold brew is a favorite with my husband.  The hot chocolate we ordered for our kids was \"real!\" The food is reasonably priced and tasty.  The service was quick and the manager walks around checking on the tables."}
{"text":"Vovomeena deserves 5 stars!  For the food and the amazing staff!  Kaj the manager is wonderful, it's like you are in a dear friend's home eating the best food!"}
{"text":"I will admit that the main reason I went to Vovomeena was because I saw the words Portuguese donuts in other yelpers reviews. In Hawaii, there are these little donuts called malasadas but they are technically Portuguese donuts and they are amazing. So I was hoping to get something close at Vovomeena. I didn't but overall my experience was still good.  The boyfriend and I went early on a Saturday so it wasn't very busy. We looked around lost and confused for a moment until someone came up to us and told us the drill - order at counter and they bring it to your table. I went basic - eggs and bacon, boyfriend went for the French toast and of course we ordered two donuts.  The food came out pretty quickly and the portions were large. My food was good but nothing unbelievable. Boyfriend liked his French toast - it was very dense and heavy so if you're looking for something light, the French toast is not. (I know French toast is not usually a \"light\" item - I'm just sayin' this was exceptionally heavy.) As excited as we were about the donuts, we were kinda let down. They tasted more like funnel cake than donuts - greasy and heavy.   The staff was nice, the food was okay but I don't think we'll go out of our way to go here again."}
{"text":"Vovomeena was really good. We went on a Saturday around 11 so it was pretty busy but the line moved quickly and we were able to get a table almost immediately after ordering. I was worried about parking but there was a decent size parking lot behind the building and another next to it. I would definitely return and try more from the menu."}
{"text":"Had such high hopes but was utterly disappointed...ordered the Mexican Benedict which was drenched in oil and was incredibly salty --couldn't even finish one...orange juice was good, staff seemed pleasant, the biscuits and gravy were good but nothing spectacular-it was biscuits and gravy. A one and done deal, prob won't be back."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed Vovomeena.  The food was excellent and the portions are great.  I would be hesitant to eat there again on a weekend, though.  It was so busy (good for them!)  Hit it up on a lazy Thursday AM for a great, chill, relaxing breakfast.  The Japanese cold brew coffee is very very tasty!"}
{"text":"Excellent local breakfast/brunch cuisine and coffee. Friendly management, plenty of seating."}
{"text":"5 stars for a yummy breakfast, great atmosphere and fabulous coffee!  My husband and I were pretty hungry as were looking for more of a brunch option around 11ish on a Tuesday. And this place had some awesome reviews on Yelp, and it did not disappoint!  I ordered the egg and bacon sandwich on a croissant with home fries and my husband ordered the biscuits and gravy. We both ordered a coffee each. After ordering you food/drink at the register, the coffee station is was located next to the register with hot coffee (decaf as well) and they also featured a Japanese cold brewing area, which was very interesting to watch against the coffee bar wall.  After ordering, everything is self serve. Also for any coffee snubs, they also offering lump sugar, either raw or white. As well as, various milks for your coffee. Also have a water area with cups.  Our meal was so delicious, just want we wanted! The vibe was laid back and the atmosphere was hip. They also had outdoor seating. Next time, I'd love to try the pain perdu."}
{"text":"Great neighborhood joint for breakfast and coffee. Fluffy pancakes, delicious coffee, and fast friendly service! Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"The food is great. The rest was really confusing. There isn't anywhere to stand to figure out what you want to eat (because you have to order before sitting). The person who took our order left us mid-sentence for a solid two minutes without explanation. Getting seated felt like we were inconveniencing them. Your food is delivered but you have to go to another counter to get your coffee. And we were sat in a location where other patrons and staff kept walking into our chairs. The whole experience was stressful lol I might be inclined to go again if it were midweek and we were the only ones in there but that's not realistic. So they certainly went out of my life with a bang."}
{"text":"Nice little joint to visit- food was decent, long waits so I would probably pick this place on a weekday after the rush."}
{"text":"I tried their biscuits and gravy, I had been hesitant to try it at first.  Needless to say I was rewarded with what I consider to be the valley's best biscuits and gravy hands down.  My wife and I and big fans of this place, they have great food."}
{"text":"My family and I visited this place on Father's Day. It was a little bit hard to find because the location is kind of hidden. However , when we finally did we were helped rather quickly despite of how busy they were. The food was delicious, and a good size too. Their coffee is great and the employees are friendly and helpful   They lost a star unfortunately because it took a bit to find, and it was slightly on the pricier side but worth it! We had a little bit of a miscommunication with one of the workers that left a little bit of a bad taste but nothing that will probably keep us from coming back"}
{"text":"Great spot. We came at 10am on a Friday so there was plenty of seating. The owner/manager maybe came to me and asked if I'd been in before, gave me a menu and said to order at the counter when I was ready. I waited for my friend and we ordered our plates along with orange juice.  Food came out fairly quick and everything looked fresh and good. I got the Wilcox Avenue breakfast, which included two eggs, spuds, biscuit and choice of meat (which I declined). I also got a Portuguese donut which came with jam and was tasty. I enjoyed my meal and it was filling and affordable. My friend got the Pawtucket West and her two pancakes were ginormous. She also liked her choices and the juice was refreshing. Definitely recommend this spot, great service as well."}
{"text":"Delicious dishes with nice staff. What else we need? I went there twice. The first time I had banana bread pudding. It is awesome, not too sweet and a bit burn  which made a perfect combo. I had Mexican Benedict on the second time. It is good and tasted totally different from the first dish I had. I cannot believe that them came from the same kitchen. Amazing."}
{"text":"All I can say is that this nice comfortable, neighborhood place is at the top of our list for breakfast!  Get there early, place your order and find a spot (and it's a good time of year to sit outside). Can you say 'tasty' food with an eclectic touch to the menu?  Try something outside the box. You can't go wrong the Banging Pocket (with local Schreiner's Sausages), the Mexican Benedict (excellent) or the Orchard French Toast. Great coffee and juice too."}
{"text":"ice brew coffee! with my traditional mexican benedict and chicken/waffle/pork chop/egg delight  use promo code for first free ride: uberSF8"}
{"text":"I'll set another scene for you...in a strange city and foodie breakfast tendencies kick in...Yelpers recommend Vovomeena!  Score!  The most difficult part was choosing savory or sweet.  I had the caramelized banana pudding French toast.  Wonderful!  Coffee, good and strong and they had almond milk.  The bacon was also super-lean.  Yum.  My comrades had the sopes with egg and chorizo and the chicken crepes and loved them both.  Bought some cold coffee with cardamom to go.  Delicious."}
{"text":"The service here is super fast! They have a great system set up. You order your food, get a number, go to the drink counter to claim your drink and wait for the manager to seat you afterwards. It is free seating though so you can easily have someone in your party find a table while you order. The food was good. I love their potatoes, very flavorful. Its a mexican/latin breakfast joint. The chamomile tea was disappointing because it was sweet..chamomile tea is not meant to be sweet/I did not get a disclaimer that it was sweetened. I got the mexican benedict which was good."}
{"text":"If you are looking for an awesome breakfast  you will  need to go here. The service is incredible and the food is perfect"}
{"text":"A little busy in the morning at all times, but once you taste they're unique twist on food it makes the wait seem like nothing. Definitely recommended especially when out on girls day or w/ friends!"}
{"text":"Great coffee if you like cold brew and fast yet delicious food.    I had the banging pocket which was a delicious pita stuffed with eggs, awesome Schreiner's sausage, and smoked gouda.  I also tried the Tortilla Espanola which is a great take on the traditional Spanish omelet.  In Spain, tortilla = omelet so don't expect any circular discs of cooked masa.  The Portuguese donuts are tasty treats as well.  Basically, they're fried dough with powdered sugar on top.  Simple and yummy.    The line moved quickly and the food came out rapidly and accurately.  The price is fair as you can have a very hearty breakfast for two with coffee for about $25-$30.  There's patio seating or plenty of tables on the interior.  If in the 7th Ave area, this is a great breakfast/brunch spot."}
{"text":"I had heard numerous good things about this place and finally took a day off work so I could stop by during a weekday morning. Since it was a weekday, it wasn't very busy. The parking was difficult to find, but there was plenty of parking once I figured it out. I was looking forward to trying a flight of their Japanese Cold Brew but unfortunately the guy who normally does it wasn't working that day. Instead, I tried an iced coffee. It was very good with the right balance of sweet and strong. To eat, I ordered the biscuits & gravy -  buttermilk biscuits, white sausage gravy, and two eggs on top. My husband ordered the Mexican Benedict - poached eggs, chorizo, hollandaise sauce on an English muffin with fried potatoes. After ordering and paying inside, we sat outside on the cute patio. Our food was delivered rather quickly. My biscuits and gravy dish was very good. The sausage gravy was very flavorful and the biscuits were very fluffy and tender. My husband's dish was also very tasty - the chorizo being the star of the plate. Overall, everything we tried was very good and would recommend others to try as well. Their pain perdu - a bread pudding French toast - looks and sounds delicious. I'll definitely be back to try a few other items."}
{"text":"The breakfast and brunch here was great.  Loved the atmosphere.  We had the special of the day which was a prime rib sandwich.  The kids had pancakes and waffles and all tasted great.  The portuguese donuts were great.  Will definitely come back again."}
{"text":"LOVE this place. Everything we've tried (tortilla Española, banging pocket, johnnycakes, savory crêpe, and the Providence) were all excellent. The coffee is fantastic. The flow for counter service is a little confusing on the first visit, but on our most-recent trip, the guy at the coffee bar was doing a great job directing traffic and explaining the process to the first-timers with confused expressions. The breakfast sausage is the best around; it tastes like it's cooked in the rendered fat from a slow-roasted pork shoulder--layer upon layer of porky deliciousness that gets Vovomeena a fifth star."}
{"text":"We went here kinda buying into the yelp hype and we were slightly let down. The coffee was fantastic and strong. The food was just alright but I may be spoiled comparing it to other places around town. I tried the bmoc some crepes dish and the Mexican Benedict and all were tasty just not really my cup of tea. I would say the chorizo on the biscuit with a poached egg tasted the best of everything I tried. The service was great and the atmosphere was trendy and hip. This would be a good place to take someone new on a breakfast date. I may give it another shot later down the road and update my review but as of right now I think the stars fit the place."}
{"text":"Not only is the food fantastic, but the service is beyond.   Having moved here from the Bay Area, I was spoiled with great food and quality people, and there are very few places here that can measure up - Vovomeena is one of them!  Came in this morning for the amazing biscuits & gravy and had a side of a pancake - delicious as always!  And the coffee - OMG!   One little snag - the water had a funny taste. Mentioned it to the manager, Kaj, and he promptly brought us a bottle of water! Really above what's necessary, but just a sign of the high quality of customer service.   If you haven't been, you have to visit. If you haven't been in a while, you have to come back!"}
{"text":"If your looking for something a little different for breakfast/brunch, this is it. All of their dishes have a slightly different twist to them and everything I have tried there so far has been delicious."}
{"text":"First off, I spent a great deal of time trying to figure out just what in the hell Vovomeena is supposed to mean. To me, it sounds like the name of some badly designed budget-friendly economy car model from the 90s that was plagued with mechanical problems and ultimately had to be recalled due to safety issues. Unfortunately, I was wrong. It's actually named after the owner's grandmother, so that's that.  We've visited Vovomeena a couple of times, with a good two-year gap in-between both stops. The place has both indoor and outdoor seating and is going for the café-styled order at the counter approach. Be warned that if you're visiting later in the day, they will inevitably be out of something - which has happened to us on both occasions.   From what I've experienced, you're fine playing it safe with something like the Willcox Avenue, which consists of your traditional eggs, meat choice (bacon in our case), and a biscuit or toast - although it can be swapped out with a pancake if you wish. The plate also includes spuds, which are potato slices that are only very lightly cooked and served up in pretty small portions. However, everything is very good quality.  If you want to get a bit crazy, go with the B.M.O.C., which consists of a waffle that's topped with a pork chop, two eggs, and a Portuguese donut. The combination is something that people will either love or loathe, depending on how your brain is wired. Personally, I thought it was good, but a bit too heavy on the stomach for someone like myself. I'm glad I tried it, but I doubt I'd order it again.  Vovomeena seems to have its fair share of fans. When studying the menu, they clearly have a nice balance of both unique creations and traditional items that isn't overwhelming. Although I doubt I'd ever put it into regular rotation, it's worth visiting on those Sunday mornings when I'm in the mood to do some brunch experimentation.  Recommended!"}
{"text":"Positive  The counter person/severs awesome people!   Cool coffee bar   Poached egg was perfect   Negative   There is a smell of drainage or sewer that hits you in the face once you get towards the back by the bigger tables  Spuds were cold   OJ was in plastic containers for here not eco friendly   No VERY vegetarian friendly   Biscuits were dry"}
{"text":"We tried Vovoveema for a second time, especially since it's so close to us, and it was an awesome dining experience. We tried a variety of menu options including the crepes, challah bread and the pita-burrito (the name escapes me!) everything was fresh and flavorful, we sat outside which was lovely and the manager was exceptionally friendly, stopping by everyone's table to say hello and make sure they were happy with their order.The flair and variety made it so whatever mood you were in there was bound to be something on the menu that would hit the spot ;) We will definitely be going again!"}
{"text":"Very cool, tasty gem of a restaurant. Went for breakfast & had a very good meal & experience. I had the banger pocket and my wife had the 3 sisters omelette. Both were excellent and more than enough food. In fact, from the plates I saw, most meals were big enough to split."}
{"text":"The best brunch in Phoenix. BMOC was amazing and full of great flavor!  It took less than 10 mins until our freshly cooked meal was ready in front of us, from the time we walked in the door. Best pork chop ever!!!!"}
{"text":"So disappointed, the papa espanola wasn't what I expected and the salsa it was topped with was just roasted tomoatoes, I thought it would have some spice to it. The arugula was really plain, not even a salad.  The kids had the tiny, baby pancakes with a piece of bacon.  Nothing impressed me unfortunately and again, this must have been a time I picked the wrong thing from the menu considering how others are raving.......not a place I'm willing to visit again based on the proportions and the taste.  Also, the place was really packed, so be prepared to wait or eat outside."}
{"text":"Amazing food!!! The Mexican Benedict tasted just like a tamale and the coffee was so good. I loved the laid back atmosphere and the waiters were so sweet. If you are downtown, this place is a must-eat restaurant"}
{"text":"Reviews is based on the Savory Crepe and Bangin Pocket.  Atmosphere - the wood decor was unique  and love the outdoor patio   Food - both dishes were super yummy and filling   The latte was also very amazing...for sure better than Starbucks   The manager and staffs were professional and friendly.  If I live around here I would come often esp the weekends!"}
{"text":"We went here to try something new and are so glad we did!  Food was excellent!  Atmosphere is eclectic but comfortable and inviting.  Super clean and staff is friendly and helpful.  Will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"Strange layout and awkward way to get coffee. I think this place would work better as actual \"sit down\" service, not counter service.   But I digress, food here is incredible. Got the biscuits and gravy, wow, have not had such good gravy in years! Go try it out!"}
{"text":"This was an awesome little \"find\" for breakfast. The Mexican Benedict for sure next time. All of the breakfast choices were amazing, I couldn't decide. I ended up having the classic biscuits and gravy with scrambled eggs, SERIOUSLY the best! No disappointments there! It's so hard to find a GOOD QUALITY independent eatery! We drove out from Surprise.......totally worth the drive. It's unfortunate we're surrounded by people who find the standard Denny's, IHOP, Mimi's, Village Inn, Waffle House and Cracker Barrel good food.  EXCELLENT!!"}
{"text":"This place is AWESOME!!! I have no ties to this place.  We have been try lots of new places lately and striking out all over the place so it was great to find VOVOMEENA today.   Highly recommend you try it!"}
{"text":"I went here on a Sunday and it was super busy. There was a line out the door, but they were pretty quick.  The waiter and waitresses provided excellent service and they had a friendly staff. I like the fact that you can watch the chefs cook as we waited in line to make our order at the register.  This place is super cute and cozy with a laid back atmosphere. The food was freshly made and came out on a timely manner. I ordered the tortilla espanol with sausage, and it was fantastic. My boyfriend ordered the toast with strawberries, which was nice because it wasn't too sweet. Would definitely recommend if you're in this area!"}
{"text":"One of the other Yelpers mentioned this place was like the restaurant from the \"Brunch Village\" episode from Portlandia and they were absolutely right! Phoenix has its version of \"Fisherman's Porch\" and it does what it does well.  That being said, this place is not for everyone. If you are not gastro-venturous and willing to pay for being so, then this is probably not your scene.  I was actually happy to find that I literally beat the crowd Sat around 11am (there was absolutely no one in line when I placed my order and the second I was handed my number there was a line out the door..,?). They have an interesting service setup here, which again, only works for a place like this. It is quasi-counter service in that you order at the counter and are given a number and afterwards can choose your seat. They also have a coffeebar, where you see the japanese cold brew drips hourglassing above, where you can pick up your ordered beverages. Based on your number, your food is brought to your table.  I ordered the mexican benedict (warning, the sauce and chorizo do have a somewhat spicy kick to them) which was delicious. The potatoes in other reviews were mentioned as \"mushy\" but I did not find them to be so. They were not as crispy as they could have been, but definitely leaned towards the cooked rather than soft side. I also loved that they have a \"coffee flight\" of their japanese cold brews. The ones I sampled were the \"straight\", vanilla cocao, and an lemon jalapeno. The latter was the only one I did not care for. I could have had a full serving of the vanilla cocoa as the density of the coffee balanced out the sweetness of the flavoring and was just perfection!   I ended my meal with a portuguese donut, which is, imho, the lovechild of a beignet and indian fry bread, and I will say, their offspring was exquisitely delicious!  The space itself was great and I loved the rustic contempo decor. The patio seating area is a kind of shared space w/the entrance to the courtyard of the little shopping center they occupy. Parking is a little limted, but thankfully I didn't have any issues finding a space.  All in all, a fantastic experience and should I ever find myself in the downtown area (or short drive from Sky Harbor) again, I will make a detour."}
{"text":"My favorite breakfast spot by far. Vovo has an intriguing ambiance and a creative menu. The food is always excellent and the iced coffee rules over all others. Don't go during prime breakfast hours or you risk having a disappointing experience; it gets waaay busier than it's queuing model has the capacity to handle.   Many favor matt's big breakfast over vovo, but I don't get it; matt's is boring by comparison."}
{"text":"Our very first stop in Arizona. If the rest of the trip has food like this, we're in for a treat. Really cute and cool decor with incredibly delicious and inventive menu items. The Pain Perdu is a must...banana bread pudding French toast, whiskey caramel and delicious sausage and/or potatoes. We also enjoyed the Orchard French toast with honey marscapone. The Banging Pocket looks delicious and will make it on our next visit. Delicious coffee, fresh squeezed orange juice, friendly staff and cool jazz music have combined to get our vacation off to a great start."}
{"text":"We came for breakfast at about ten on a Sunday morning. Our table had Mexican Benedict, pancakes, and biscuits and gravy. The food is good, home style cooking but didn't seem outstanding. Everyone liked their food with the exception of the hash browns being a little below average.  Would we come back?  Probably in the winter but it's maybe not good enough to come back, stand in line and then eat outside in Phoenix in July."}
{"text":"The service was great. Every single person who worked here was nice and helpful.  The location right off the 10 was extremely convenient.  The food was good, a bit eccentric, but different and fun. I wasn't a big fan of the mocha but my mom liked her coffee. The beans were roasted in Cave Creek. You grab a menu when you come in and then jump in line and place your order and then pay at the counter then find a table and they bring you your food and take your dishes away when you are finished. It's very well run. I had the biscuits and gravy and my mom had the Mexican eggs Benedict. I'm from Chicago and only like Chicago style sausage, so I wasn't a big fan of the sausage in either, but it's a chorizo so it's different.  Those two meals and the coffee and mocha plus two orange juices was $40, so a bit pricey, but good.  It filled us both up."}
{"text":"This place was great.  They have a nice outdoor seating area as well as plenty of room inside to sit.  The decor is really nice--it felt like I was stepping inside a West Elm catalog.    As for the food, we loved it.  I had apple/potato pancakes and my husband had the Mexican benedict--both were fantastic.  Oh and the coffee is fresh and hot, which is also a plus.    The staff was friendly and helpful.  I'd definitely go back when I am in the area again."}
{"text":"Ordered the Mexican Benedict and boy was it tasty! The sopes soak up the sauce from the chorizo and the meal has just enough spice. Side of potatoes were really nicely cooked too.  Love the location because the parking lot doesn't get too packed and the restaurant is very quaint. Would come back in a heartbeat next time I'm in the area!"}
{"text":"The americano here is some of the best i've had. So smooth. Perfect temperature. We came to Phoenix on vacation and went here almost every day!  Food is excellent. Tried a number of things including the mexican benedict, savoury crepe. The pancakes are so fluffy. Perfect.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"I don't know where to begin.....the service, atmosphere and the food was perfect. I was quickly greeted as soon as I entered the door by a very kind man who I found out was the manager. He gave me a menu and explained a little bit about the process of what to expect when dining here. While you wait in line to place your order you're able to watch the cooks grill up some of the tasty plate options which makes it even tougher to figure out what you want to eat. The aroma from the grill is just intoxicating!! Ok.... focus!!! :) So, the juice if freshly squeezed here too. Talk about every single detail was evaluated here. You are seated after you order your food so don't pick a table prematurely. You can choose to dine in or outside either way the atmosphere is very inviting. So back to the food. I've had the chorizo, biscuits and gravy, waffles and chicken, and the ham. Everything tasted spectacular and was cooked perfectly. The way that they plate the food here is a work of art. I guess you can see that I'm a fan. So fellow yelpers and foodies you need to come and check this spot out if you haven't already, see you there!"}
{"text":"It was a nice place but extremely overcrowded. Kind of a funky concept in that you have to wait to be seated but aren't actually waited on. The food was overpriced and our service was terrible."}
{"text":"The Mexican eggs benedict was awesome.  One star off because they don't have Sriracha but I'm pretty sure we talked them into getting some so they can still win it back.  The French toast was also awesome.  The location is cute and a nice size.  I think this was a great addition to the area.  Get some Japanese cold brew."}
{"text":"Johnny Cakes w prickly pear syrup, damn good."}
{"text":"Must try! Being from Los Angeles where there is a ton of amazing food options, I was surprised there weren't a lot of hip brunch options in Phoenix, but thanks to yelp, I found this spot! Great, amazing, scrumptious food! To top it off, the service is phenomenal!! If I'm ever in Phoenix again, this is the one stop I am adding to my list."}
{"text":"I had the 3 sisters omelette and my girlfriend had the savory crepes. The omelette was nicely done and the corn added a nice flavor to it. The bacon was crisp and well seasoned and not too salty. The crepes were also delicious."}
{"text":"Beautiful shabby chic interior. Great cafe style ordering of food. Wonderful service. Food was impeccable! Japanese cold brewed coffee was to die for!  I've been here a good handful of times and tried something different from the menu each time.  My favorite so far is either the Mexican Benedict or the Banging Pocket. Each has its merits.   This gem is from the same folks that brought us Tuck Shop and Astor House. The same staff from what I remember from Astor house, even, if I remember correctly. Everyone is super friendly regardless.  Just one more reason to love breakfast. Thanks Vovomeena!"}
{"text":"Couple of things...  1.) Probably the best breakfast food I have had in a long time. Albeit, über sinful, it was very delicious. I would give five stars, but...  2.) They could stand to figure out their seating situation. The seating is organized like a Carl Jr's (ordering food, get a number, then sit). This causes table chaos, because people come in, scope out a spot, then a representative from the table places the order. I call shenanigans, because my wife and I had to order than wait, then literally run to the first available table.   As we finished up, the line grew out the door, and I felt bad for the poor suckers who were going to give Vovomeena their cash, then have to stand and wait for a table to open up.   We were sure to let the manager know this problem, but not sure what's in store for their future."}
{"text":"Great coffee!  My ONLY complaint....why, oh why do you have to close at 1:30 pm?!  That is right when I'm wanting to start heading to a coffee shop to chill and work.  ugh!"}
{"text":"Cute small little place with just average food.  Maybe if you come here with no expectations you might enjoy it more than we did.  The staff of very nice and accommodating.  The place is kept clean and tidy.   But in my opinion overpriced.  I don't cook but I think I could have made a better breakfast sandwich and omelet at home."}
{"text":"What a wonderful place for breakfast.   Great concept great execution.  Fabulous coffee.  Makes me wish I lived in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Quick service. Great food!  Even though the line was long, it moved along very efficiently."}
{"text":"Had the amazing Mexican eggs Benedict! I never would have thought to replace the English muffin with a sope, so creative and tasty. The ice coffee was delectable. Thanks Yelpers for helping me decide"}
{"text":"I am hard to impress when it comes to breakfast.  The food was alright, nothing to write home about.  You won't find crispy potatoes and the pancakes are thin and soggy.  We tried the donut and it tasted of the dirty oil it was fried in. Everything else was average. The ambience is fresh and casual.  You order at a counter, receive a number and take a seat.  I wouldn't come out of my way to eat here, but if I found myself here through friends, I wouldn't object."}
{"text":"10/25/12  Cool-looking eatery!  Loved the artwork, especially the mosaic pieces, and I liked the twist taken by using recycled twine as a dividing line between the pathway and the tables.  Way too cool!  :)  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/vovomeena-phoenix?select=lNWXre8YuohFjH0CE08kuA#lNWXre8YuohFjH0CE08kuA http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/vovomeena-phoenix?select=zWLgge2mUuG7i232sb-BOA#zWLgge2mUuG7i232sb-BOA http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/vovomeena-phoenix?select=x3WxOi5yqaNPJsVNdKLaJA#x3WxOi5yqaNPJsVNdKLaJA  I've eaten here twice, once with a friend (see photos taken on 09/30/12).  The first time, we ordered a few items and shared, and we were both blown away by the very-high quality and big portions of the dishes we tried.  My favorites then were the Pain Perdu with Schreiner's sausage, http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/vovomeena-phoenix?select=KF5Mrjny8RrmU1wkGEDBNw#KF5Mrjny8RrmU1wkGEDBNw and the B.M.O.C.-- a HUGE bone-in pork chop presented on a lovely waffle, topped with two fried eggs, with caramelized apples in whiskey sauce to garnish.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/vovomeena-phoenix?select=9BLumlsGZoBPrBvWRvQDTQ#9BLumlsGZoBPrBvWRvQDTQ  We tried two other items, the Banging Pocket (didn't impress me) and Boxty (I found it too greasy).  On my October visit, I was disappointed in the much-smaller portioned Pain Perdu I received, http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/vovomeena-phoenix?select=5Jbb8gMJPv1WlkyySATCNg#5Jbb8gMJPv1WlkyySATCNg and the pieces were so dense, they weren't much fun to eat. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/vovomeena-phoenix?select=DDmVrbDoa7yz2OGsznjbjg#DDmVrbDoa7yz2OGsznjbjg  The coffee was still very good, however.  Five stars for the first visit, and 1 star for the second- great coffee, and free refills to boot, so what's not to love?, so an average of 3 stars.  Will return to try the B.M.O.C. again.  Hope to bump it up to four stars, which is a good review from me, as I'm assuming this isn't a GMO-free establishment..."}
{"text":"Great breakfast. You must try Mexican Eggs Benedict ! Sopes are authentic as is chorizo!"}
{"text":"Great energy and positive vibes at this pleasant surprise of a brunch spot. Food was excellent as was the friendly staff. Left stuffed to the gills with yummy deliciousness. Will return on the next Phoenix visit...wish this place was in my neighborhood in California. Thanks Vovomeena!"}
{"text":"If you have had a night out and wake up with the worst hangover of your life, this place will revive you! My friends and i come here just about every weekend. Today, all three of us got the chicken and waffles special and it was the BEST thing I have EVER eaten in my entire life. Love, love, LOVE."}
{"text":"Awesome food. Many recommended the Mexican benne but I preferred the biscuits and gravy."}
{"text":"The food is excellent, the prices are very fair and the customer service is excellent. Super cute hipster location with an open kitchen. When we walked in we were greeted by a friendly guy who seemed to fit the roll of a manager. He explained how it works, you order at the counter first and get a number and there always seems to be enough open space (tables) once you order and get your number. The server will bring your food out a few minutes later.   We all opted for the fresh orange juice, which was outstanding! We had the Pain Perdu which I didn't care for.  I was thinking Pain Perdu was going to be a banana French toast/ bread pudding type of deal, but to me it taste like soggy fruit cake with bananas over it and a rich caramel sauce.The floating manager guy was super accommodating and recommended the Orchard French toast as a replacement. Yummy. The French toast was perfect with the apple ribbons to provide a nice subtle Apple crunch and flavor change throughout the dish. We had Johnny pancakes with eggs over easy which was my fav. The pancakes are huge and delicious and the eggs were perfectly seasoned and cooked. We had pork sausage, turkey sausage and the potatoes side. All were delicious! The sausage was hearty, a bit spicy and good sized, but most importantly, not oily so the high quality of meat should definitely be noted. This was the best turkey sausage I've ever had. We also got the waffle kid's meal which comes with 3 delicious fluffy waffle sections and a sausage for $4.95.   2 adult meals, a kids meal and 3 fresh orange juice for $33 is a very great deal. We can't wait to go back and try more of the menu."}
{"text":"From the outside this place is difficult to distinguish as a restaurant, I thought it was a woman's clothing boutique forever. We waited in line to order, it went fairly quick for a busy weekend brunch rush. The kitchen is open so you can see where all of the magic happens =-) I ordered the 3 sisters omelet and it was very interesting. A lot of flavors I would not traditionally put together but actually worked really well. My husband got the banging pocket and enjoyed his as well. They have a separate coffee station if you just need a pick me up. Reasonable prices and cute hipster little place to check out if you have not already."}
{"text":"We went on Mother's Day around 9:00 am and they were able to put tables together for the 10 of us. The service people were very nice and friendly. We really liked the food. Among all of us, we had just about everything on the menu. If I had never had Matt's hashbrowns and bacon, I would have thought theirs were great. Still good though. I had the BMOC and it was wonderful. My husband had the Grilllades. He hates biscuits and gravy so I was surprised. He liked it and the fact that it was spicy probably really helped. I tasted the pancakes and waffles that others had and they also were very good. Based on just one visit, we will definitely go again."}
{"text":"This has been our best breakfast we've had since we move here from Pennsylvania. I had the biscuits and gravy. The biscuit was the size of my hand and the gravy is the best I've had. We will be back to try the rest of the menu."}
{"text":"I'll give it a five star! First the place, very unique, nice art work outside the building. Second, the people that work there are very nice. The person in charge or the owner? (not sure who checked on us on how we're doing.) But thanks for checking on us. Third, the food was fantastic! We got the b.m.o.c and the blackstone scramble and i cannot pass the opportunity to try the japanese cold brew coffee, i got the flight o'-  black tea, orange peel & ginger, lemon & jalapeño. It was very unique! The downside was they ran out of hollandaise sauce for the mexican benedict that's why we ordered blackstone scramble instead. I will come back for sure!"}
{"text":"Just finished a truly fantastic breakfast at this place. Egg sandwich was delicious - sauce was very tasty and just the right amount. The Johnny cakes are an experience not to be missed - essentially a pancake with real corn and Chile inside. So so good."}
{"text":"The food was great but the seating arrangement was not so great. Although we didn't have to wait long to get seated it was cramped and uncomfortable. We will return and hopefully go on a less busy day."}
{"text":"Saturday morning trip downtown PHX and our tummies were hungry, hungry for great food at that.  If anyone were to ask me about Vovomeena I would describe them in one word: consistent.  Consistency for years and years of us coming here, I took a photo on IG in May of 2013 and since then they've only improved!   If you want a party in your mouth, dine here.  If you're timid on trying new things, don't dine here.  They specialize in dishes you won't see anywhere else and the menu proves that!  I highly recommend VOvomeena if you are ready to take breakfast up a notch!"}
{"text":"What a fun place. Delicious coffee!!  The decor is spontaneously surreptitious and valiant. I liked the rope decor and the folks there were friendly. I had the enormous pancakes which were as cakey as a cake can be. My son, Pogo, had the biscuits and eggs which he described as \"voluminous\" and \"good\". My wife enjoyed the veggie burrito which I tried and loved it!  Really good place and delish! Highly recommend this little gem in a gem of a town."}
{"text":"Good eats!  Had the blackstone scramble. Really good. I'd add cheese. Homemade tortillas are awesome."}
{"text":"Food is very flavorful. There service is different as other restaurant but it works. I love their food it's different it tastes home made and the flavor sit has are outstanding . They are a little pricier than other breakfast joints BUT so worth it. Give it a try!"}
{"text":"The food was great as well as the cold brew.  The reason for 4 stars is the less than friendly staff. No one was out right rude, but only 1-2 staff actually even smiled. I also am not a really big fan of the order at the counter and seat yourself concept. But I had the Johnny Cakes and was extremely happy. My husband has the Mexican Eggs Benedict and said it was quite tasty."}
{"text":"Pretty tasty breakfast, had the mexican benedict which was savory and spicy.  Ordered a side of pork sausage which was ok but not great.  I shall return for the benedict, very delicious."}
{"text":"After months of eating at Vovomeena, I'm not sure why I shop for groceries any more.  My only complaint?  I wish they were open later."}
{"text":"The gentleman with the glasses greeted us on arrival and he was very friendly. He told us how things work here where you look over the menu, order what ya want, then you sit wherever you'd like. He was very accommodating throughout our entire visit and made us feel at home. The food omg the food was amazing. I had the Mexican Benedict and my gf had the biscuits, gravy and eggs. They were sooooo good the egg was delicious and the chorizo was very good not too salty and everything being on top of the sope I highly recommend this dish. The biscuits were nice and fluffy and the gravy was very flavorful. Next time I'm in the Arizona area this is definitely going to be my go to spot for breakfast. Thank you so much to the man in glasses who I believe was the owner for his hospitality my family and I appreciated it very much. To anyone reading supporting local businesses like Vovomeena are just as good as finding gold I tell ya."}
{"text":"Do you watch that show 'Portlandia'? If so, then you're already familiar with this place. Not because the restaurant itself is featured in the show (it's not), but because this restaurant is the sort of place that they're always poking tongue-in-cheek fun of. It's hipsterish, it's a wee bit self-important, and you'll come up on phrases like 'hand-crafted' a LOT, but the simple fact of the matter is that they've got DAMNED good food, some DAMNED good coffee, a DAMNED friendly staff, and DAMNED adequate seating.  We came here for brunch (oh shut up) and thoroughly enjoyed our experience. You *ARE* going to be surrounded by Caucasian hipsters with children named Schuyler and Harrison, but that shouldn't turn you off too much. This place has gotten some good buzz lately, and I'm thinking that they'll probably just get more and more crowded in the coming months. That's why you need to get out there RIGHT NOW and enjoy some good food and good coffee, so when you take your friends with you you can be all like:    \"Oh yeah you know I used to come here all the time before it was popular\"  And you'll be a better person for it."}
{"text":"Craving biscuits and gravy and reviewers raved about them here. The gravy itself wasn't all that flavorful, but it was full of sausage chunks that helped. The biscuit was a bit stale; almost like they had used a day-old biscuit in my dish. My boyfriend had the pancakes and enjoyed those, though."}
{"text":"This is the hipsterest place I've been to, I think, ever. And I yelp a lot and consider myself a bit of a food hipster. I think I'm taking off the star because I felt almost uncomfortable eating there, like I might stain or break some piece of art or antique children that was made by the blind albino children of Nepal (but only the ones named Frank). Can a space be *too* atmospheric? I didn't think so... but I appear to have been proven wrong.  The breakfast was great, though, I had the grillades. Nice, rich, buttery biscuits, delicious peppery gravy, and chunks of very tender beef. Only ding was that they could do scrambled, over easy/medium/hard or sunny side up - nothing else. That covers 96% of the requests out there, but hey, I'm a food hipster, right? I like my eggs basted."}
{"text":"Had a day off and thought I'd amble down here today..friends had recommended it.  Had the orchard french toast, bacon and coffee.  The bacon was tasty, the apple slices on the french toast were a good touch.  Nice little place, good decor.  A little unusual in that you get your own coffee (no table service).   Definitely will try again."}
{"text":"This is a great breakfast spot. Terrific omelettes and scrambles with unique flavor combinations and excellent meats, bacon,sausages etc...  vegetarian options as well, of course. The biscuits are excellent, and the Portuguese donuts are simply sublime."}
{"text":"Johnnycakes ($8.50): Corn and chile cakes, prickly pear maple syrup, sweet rice, and sausage. Omgosh, this is soo good! It's like a pancake, but made with corn and chile. The flavor is amazing and I loved the texture (tender inside like a buttermilk pancake with a crispy exterior). The fresh strawberries and syrup was fantastic with it. The sweet rice was a cinnamon rice pudding that was good, but an odd addition to the cakes.  Mexican Benedict ($10.95): Poached eggs, chorizo, tomato, cilantro, hollandaise on sopes with spuds. I just love variations of the traditional benedict and this one really hit the mark for me. The sopes were wonderful and such a great alternative to the English muffin. Obviously, chorizo is always great and it worked really well here; also, its spice was toned down a bit by the hollandaise. The spuds were tasty, too.  You order and pay at the counter and then grab a table. The menu is fun; I definitely have my eye on other items for another visit, however, those Johnnycakes are a must again! Fantastic service."}
{"text":"Delish! I ordered the Pawtucket west and added 2 OM eggs. The perfect mixture of sweet and savory."}
{"text":"Quite possibly my favorite breakfast place in Phoenix.  Working my way through the menu. Don't count out any specials. Love the outdoor patio, flies, not so much. My 1st breakfast was the Mexican Benedict, today it's the special, Portuguese scramble, eggs w/linguica, peppers & potatoes. Very filling!!"}
{"text":"I loved the people in here (employees were super friendly)....I loved the patio. I loved the free parking. The design and little kitchy things that made this place unique.   My husband said his espresso was excellent. Seemed like a super popular place.   I feel like the menu could be better somehow. Wish they had poached eggs.   This was my only problem: I discovered a hair in my food.....I was upset. I didn't tell anyone. I was grossed out.   The people, staff were welcoming and super friendly. That part I loved."}
{"text":"Stellar food. Yummm & sooo creative. Had the corn cakes (pancakes). Sooo good. Bacon is flavorful. Top notch ingredients. Eat here!"}
{"text":"Shared a Mexican Benedict and a banana bread French toast. I was a little disappointed in the French toast. There were whole slices of banana in the bread that were dry in texture. The Benedict was wonderful and had a kick to it. It was served on top of a corn tortilla type muffin and really added to the flavor. The Devore and staff were wonderful. I would definitely go back and try more items off the menu."}
{"text":"Wow! What a hidden gem! The food is unique and absolutely delicious! I'll be back for sure! I had my heart set on a breakfast burrito.. Try the bangin pocket. Holy cow.. Delicious!"}
{"text":"Now this is breakfast! Just landed in Phoenix and my family and me were so hungry. Peanuts on the plane are cool, but I need some substance. And substance did I get. Looked to my trusty Yelpers for a place near the hotel and this was the first place to come up. Didn't even bother to look at the menu, Siri, tell me where to go.   When we arrived, we had to park in a tiny lot, where cars circle in hopes for a spot to open. Luckily, someone was leaving as we were coming. Inside is super cute with seating inside and shaded seating outside. Here you grab a menu, order, then seat yourself. Menus are on the wall, we had a time finding them. Everything had a name that I'm not used to reading. On a whim, I ordered Johnnycakes, which was 2 corn & chile cakes, sweet rice, syrup, and potatoes.  No egg and no meat, the guy put extra potatoes. Ok, sir, you're cool and already know me!  My family placed their orders and we all waited patiently. All the plates came out relatively close to one another and we dug in. Now, looking from the outside, you would not guess at all what you were about to bite into, but it was a pleasant surprise. It was literally corn & chile! With the syrup and sweet rice it was just too delicious. The cakes were a good size, too. And there were strawberries on top. My. Goodness. I couldn't stop. Then to the potatoes ,which were perfectly crispy some bites. I was in breakfast heaven, and I'm not a big fan unless is basic. But this blew all the other breakfasts out of the orange juice! My family really enjoyed theirs too as their plates were empty. I couldn't finish all of mine, I think the extra spuds got me, since I finished those."}
{"text":"Very good food. Had the b.m.c.o. Comes layered with waffle on the bottom covered with apple-maple syrup. Much better than regular maple syrup. The next layer is the best part it was the smoked pork chop grilled to perfection and fork tender. The scrambled eggs on top got the smoke flavor too. Yummy. The other meal ordered was the Wilcox avenue. Scrambled eggs, bacon and wheat toast. All good. Cold brewed coffee is not bitter. Will be back for sure. Counter service very friendly."}
{"text":"First time there today. Definitely will go back. Great service and the food and coffee are excellent."}
{"text":"Great food and atmosphere! The coffee bar is also a nice touch. I had the Mexican eggs benedict and it was phenomenal! Fast and friendly service as well. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Pretty dang good. This place is a hidden hole in the wall. Firstly, the orange juice is bomb. It's a stupid thing to comment on, but do not underestimate a glass of fresh squeezed orange juice. Also, take their advice, the biscuits and gravy are phenomenal. It's what dreams are made of. Will definitely have to bring some friends here to try it out also. Thanks guys!"}
{"text":"This place is great. Worth a try. Recommend not looking at yelp and just ordering what you find interesting"}
{"text":"I came here on Sunday for brunch and I told my friend who was with me that we should go somewhere else so we don't have to wait in line! Turns out going to this restaurant was the best decision I made that day!   The staff was really friendly and I asked several questions about the menu and the waiter was really patient with me!   The cold brew that I ordered was bigger than I expected which is always a plus and I ordered the BMOC which has a good blend of hearty smoked pork and a sweet syrup so you get the best of both worlds!   I definitely can't wait to go back and explore more of the menu!"}
{"text":"This was my first time here this morning. I must say this was the best food ever! Good selection of food, the portions are huge!  Staff friendly. I will definitely be going back"}
{"text":"Kind of an interesting vibe in here... Asian mixed with nautical theme? The coffee was really not great, but I got the breakfast sandwich and it was pretty good. We tried the savory crepes as well which I didn't like as much. The man at the register who greeted us was very, very nice, and it didn't take us too long to get our food. They have a nice patio space outside."}
{"text":"Second time here....the biscuits and gravy are to die for, but if you don't like spicy maybe ask for easy gravy. Came in today and devoured the pancakes (Primrose Hill). Coffee is good too!"}
{"text":"This place was a little hard to find, but i found it! And thank god i did! Its a cute little resturant, very mellow inside. I ordered the pain perdu and it was awesome! VERY different from what im used too but very good. The pain perdu came with bacon which was a nice mix of sweet and savory. The texture of the bread was a little weird reminded me if i was eating a very very stiff but moist cake. The only downfall i think would be there are A LOT of flies inside.. it was hard to eat because i was constantly shooing away flies.. But other than that i enjoyed myself very much."}
{"text":"Found this place on Yelp. It was okay.  Pros: Decent food but nothing spectacular or memorable. Easy location to find but it's sort of tucked into this little 6 business center. Employees were nice.  Cons: There are no fountain drinks, that means $2.50 for 1 can of coke. It's one of those strange \"order at the counter, we bring it to you\" places. This leaves a ridiculously long line zig-zagging throughout the entire walkway and eating area of an already cramped dining room. Outdoor seating had only wobbly plastic tables and chairs which led to numerous spills of the coffee.  I won't be going again but if it's your first time and you love coffee, go during the week to avoid the insanely long line and wait time."}
{"text":"The best breakfast in town !!! Awesome little place as comfortable as eating in your own home . Very cool atmosphere , rockin' menu items , great coffee and no better staff....eat here and be happy !!!"}
{"text":"Yeah, it sucks that they don't allow substitutions. I'm not going to argue that.  But the food is quality, and the choices are not your standard breakfast-joint fare. Come here because it is something different, not because you want the usual!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere was hip and the place was super busy, but we still managed to get in and out in like 22 minutes.  I had the biscuits and gravy and my brother-in-law had the Wilcox Ave. (the generic breakfast) both were delicious.  I am definitely trying this place again a d may rate higher if the service and quality persist."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place.  First time there and definitely will be a repeat customer. The menu is so interesting and innovative.  Husband had the Special, biscuits and gravy with fried eggs....this was like no other sausage gravy you have ever had...this was a masterpiece.  I had the potato pancakes with grated apples...fabulous!  Kai, the Manager, is a real professional.  He has this restaurant running like a charm.  He is truly an asset to this establishment.  Can't wait to return."}
{"text":"Diverse menu with cooks that can back it up. Place was really busy and they were able to put out 4 star food in very short order."}
{"text":"Food was good but a little pricy and the service was lacking when we ordered our food at the register and this isn't the first time unfortunately. Definitely work to improve etiquette at the register.  Update:  Vovomeena reached out to rectify which is greatly appreciated. A lot to be said of a business."}
{"text":"I love this place. I have come 6-7 times since living (near) Phoenix and have brought several friends here who have all enjoyed it. I always look forward to a visit here. I recommend trying their cold brew sampler if you are into trying delicious coffee with infused flavor that doesn't taste artificially sweet. My favorite flavor is the vanilla bean and cocoa nibs or the plain one. Super delicious and smooth. I always enjoy my dishes but my favorite is the bread pudding (pain de perdu, I think) which is consistently delicious."}
{"text":"I left a review for this place and saved it in draft mode after having a unpleasant experience here last year. The service was bad and the food just wasn't good. After taking my mom to Matt's during her visit here, I told her about this place since I had heard so many good things about it.  I ordered the B.M.O.C., my son had the biscuit & gravy & the pain perdu and my mom had the Pawtucket West, none of us were pleased, my eggs arrived cold and when I asked that it be placed in the microwave to warm up a helper stated \"we don't have a microwave here\" and walked off....needless to say I was refunded my money back for my meal while my mother & son opted to deal with what they had and not complain.  I originally came home and wrote a yelp review to which I was contacted by the owner and offered the opportunity to come back and have breakfast on him in an attempt to change my perception of this place. I agreed, and THOUGHT I saved my review in draft mode for an update of the original review in addition to the new one, but apparently I did not because it's gone. Anywho, although my firm is located less than a mile from here and my son attends the art school across the street, I have never felt the need to come back for that comp meal.   So I guess it's safe to just leave my 2 stars (which is only 2 because of the owner) and keep it moving. I will state that although the helper guy was extremely rude, the owner was very nice and accommodating and did everything in his power to appease me."}
{"text":"It's been almost a month since my trip Vovomeena, and wish it weren't 2,000 Miles away from me. I wake up most mornings craving their pain perdu, and can't wait to eat it again on my next spring training trip. If you enjoy French toast and bananas you'll love this dish! All the other items I tried from my friends were excellent, and Vovomeena has the best coffee you'll find in any breakfast restaurant. You'll fall in love with their Japanese cold brew coffee."}
{"text":"Great brunch place with a cool southern twist to the traditional american diner brunch food. The cuban benedict daily special tasted more like an open top burger than the traditional eggs benedict. The b.m.o.c was rather large in portion size. I like that the slightly salty smoked pork chop goes very well with the plain waffles and sweet apple-maple syrup. The blend in sweet and salty, as well as the different textures made this a rather well executed dish.  Their special Japanese ice coffee was also rather tasty, and definitely did the job of giving me the caffeine kick I needed!"}
{"text":"This place is really yummy! I tried the biscuits and gravy and the Mexican Benedict. The biscuits and gravy were awesome although I felt like the egg on top felt kind of out of place and didn't really add much to the dish but delicious none the less.   The Mexican Benedict was great. The bread was a little too chewy and tough for my liking but it was pretty good. The potatoes weren't crispy at all and could use a little more crunch and seasoning."}
{"text":"Cute little brunch spot that I'd love to come to with girl friends. You order before seating yourself, they have their own little coffee bar where you can see how they brew the Japanese drip coffee.   While paying for the meal I noticed some $20 bills in their tip jar so expected a lot. Was sadly disappointed by the three meals that my family shared. The coffee was delicious, the potatoes were delicious....annnnd thats about it. Willing to give the place another chance though!"}
{"text":"The BMOC is pretty big compared to the other entrees. It was a very interesting mixture of sweet and some salty. Quite unique.  The place is casual, hip and charming. Really nice atmosphere."}
{"text":"Had an iced coffee. It was good, but way too expensive.  I paid $5 for a 16 oz iced coffee. So my point: good coffee, just too expensive."}
{"text":"Vovomeena is an incredible find in Phoenix!  From the decor, to the service, the amazing food options and delicious coffee, I always try to stop here when I am in the area.   After visiting a number of times, i have only tried two dishes because they are so very delicious!  The Tortilla Espinola & Mexican Benedict are both amazing....cooked to perfection and so flavorful.  And, their coffee is the BEST!  This is a must-try....it will not disappoint!"}
{"text":"It's no surprise this place is rated as high as it is. Another cool spot in PHX. Had the b.m.o.c. and it was pretty incredible. The combination of a fried egg over a smoked pork chop on top of a waffle was f'ing amazing."}
{"text":"I wonder why I never stopped into this place considering I've walked by it so many times after leaving Chipotle or Zoyo. The food and service here is great, I ordered the pancakes with eggs and turkey sausage. The food came out quick and was delicious. It's hard to find a good pancake but these were delicious. I can't wait to go back and try the chorizo eggs Benedict!"}
{"text":"Great food, great atmosphere, and great service. Highly recommend to all az foodies out there :D"}
{"text":"We stopped by here for breakfast while staying in PHX. The food was excellent. The coffee was outstanding, we ordered a Togo jug of the cold brewed coffee for later in the day. Everything was beyond our expectations."}
{"text":"Had breakfast here this morning, and while there are still some kinks to be worked out, it was overall a very pleasant way to start the day. I had already stopped in a few times since they opened for coffee on the way to work, so I already knew the staff is friendly and courteous. This was confirmed today when, on their first really busy Sunday, the kitchen was backed up and the wait for food was long (we waited over 30 minutes for ours to come out, and even then it came out in waves).   Both our server and the (owner? manager?) made a point to stop at our table and thank us for our patience as they experienced their first busy weekend. Hey, I don't mind waiting too much if it's obviously something the management is aware of and trying to fix. I'm sure it will be smoother next time.   The food was excellent and lives up to the standards expected from the folks at Tuck Shop. We went with the boxty, two donuts, sauteed potatoes, a pancake (1 is very large and fluffy), and an egg/cheese omelet.   Critiques: 1)The menu specifically states \"no substitutions\" for breakfasts. However, I was told when I ordered that if I didn't want a side of meat, they would deduct the charge for it. So apparently, they are not as inflexible as they seem, but I wish I had known that while I was frantically trying to compose a breakfast that didn't include meat.   2)Because of the above-mentioned \"rule\", the logical solution is to order from the (small) a la carte section at the bottom, which is what my husband did. It would be nice if they would ask if you want everything to come out on the same plate rather than trying to fit a separate plate for 1 pancake, potatoes, 1 omelette, and donuts on the table when it was really all one meal. We ended up doing it ourselves at the table and handing 3 empty plates back to the server.   3)Order the donuts. If you like things that are amazing, then don't miss these. OK, that wasn't a critique. I just couldn't wait to mention these little puffs of funnel-cake heaven.  4)Hey! Vovomeena! There are a lot of vegetarians in the world, and we want to give you money to make our food. We're not asking you to change your world-view or anything, but just a little acknowledgement that not everyone wants a \"choice of meat\" on every single menu item. You guys are pretty light on the fruit and vegetable side of things, and no, fried potatoes don't count. And how about some other options besides cheese in the omelette? Please?   5)If you are an inflexible vegan, there is absolutely nothing you can eat here. Except maybe the potatoes, but I bet they're sauteed in butter. You can, however, enjoy a tasty soy latte and pout while your friends enjoy their food. But then again, you're vegan; you're used to this. (sigh)  I will eat here again. I promise to add a star next time if either the wait time or the non-meat options are improved...I will even think about adding TWO stars if both of those requests are heeded."}
{"text":"We were in a rush to catch the diamondbacks game and wanted some brunch type meal with some coffee. We called ahead to see if there was a wait, and the person of the phone responded with there's never a wait, but it's a little busy right now. I was curious to know how there is never a wait, and it's because you go up to place your order and then find a seat. Very clever way to handle a rush in my opinion. We tried the Japanese iced coffee and it was really good. I had the tortilla espanola, which was delicious and fluffy like a cake, but savory like an omelet. I also ordered a Portuguese doughnut, which was kinda harder than what I would expect a doughnut to be, it was lightly sweet, so it kind of reminded me of a flattened churro."}
{"text":"The best biscuits and gravy I've ever had. The best biscuits and gravy I've ever had.  The best biscuits and gravy I've ever had.  The best biscuits and gravy I've ever had."}
{"text":"We have been coming here for breakfast weekly for over a year now. Never been disappointed... Great food and awesome service. If you want to rev up your taste buds this is the place awesome favors that will keep you coming back for more ..did I mention the great service ."}
{"text":"I'm usually pretty lazy about having to get in the car and go somewhere from brunch since I have quite a few choices within walking distance. But after trying Vovomeena this weekend, I may have to make an exception.  When my boyfriend and I walked in, we were a little confused about how it works. The manager was super friendly and guided us through the process. You order at the register, they give you a number, you pick a seat, and they deliver your food. I ordered the tortilla espanola, which is a potato and egg Spanish omelet, and my boyfriend got the pancakes with sausage. We also got two donuts to share, because why not?  The highlight for us both was the omelete. My boyfriend doesn't like eggs, and after trying the omelete, he said he would probably get that next time. The omelete is very basic, but it's still delicious and the hot sauce it comes with adds the perfect kick. We both also really liked the pancakes. Nothing fancy about them- they just taste like really really good homemade pancakes.   While the side of sausage was delicious, my side of bacon was kind of lackluster. I would definitely recommend the sausage over the bacon. The donuts were also just okay. They just didn't taste like they were freshly made.  We got here about 9am and didn't have to wait at all. But by the time we left, there was quite the line waiting for tables to open up since it's seat yourself. They also had a decent sized patio, but since it was raining, everyone wanted to sit inside. I'm thinking the crowd might not be so bad when outside seating is also an option.  I almost forgot to mention, the prices were great! With our two entrees, side of donuts, glass of milk, and a coffee, the bill was barely $20. I will definitely be adding Vovomeena into the brunch rotation!"}
{"text":"Not from AZ, used yelp to find a nice, favorable restaurant of the locals. I found this restaurant to be a flop unfortunately. I really wanted to like it. The location was ridiculously hard to locate, the decor is adorable, and the food was subpar. Walking in had no direction on what to do, apparently you walk to a wall and grab a menu then proceed to the cashier stand and order, then grab a number and seat yourself, which I found to be slightly edgey yet confusing. My cashier was unpleasant to order with as I was with a vegetarian person and she wouldn't budge on letting us upcharge for a french toast? It would have to of been a separate charge to an addition of their meal. I ordered a Mexican Benedict which seemed like a nice modern twist, everything they could have cooked before service, THEY DID AND IT SHOWED. The poached egg, was over cooked (no runny yolk at all) and cooked well before I ordered, as were their breakfast potatoes, which were too thick, par cooked, slightly cold and just mainly inedible. Overall, it's a neat concept restaurant, yet I would not go back."}
{"text":"My friend wanted to take me to breakfast and when she mentioned the place I was thrilled to try it out, being from out of town and judging by the reviews it was worth the try.  The interior was beautiful. I absolutely loved the decor, it was simple and clean. Even the bathroom was designed well. You order your food first and then seat yourself at a table. Beware of large brunch crowds.   The food alone was wonderful. The meals were perfection and prepared with the slightest simple yet effective touch. What really drew me to the place was the flight of cold brew, what a genius idea!! We ordered a mexican benedict and a BOMC. The benedict was exactly what I expected, its presentation was great and the chorizo definitely gave off it's mexican flavor. The BOMC was spectacular. The portion is enough for two and easily one of my favorite dishes, even though I haven't tried anything else.....it was just that good. The pork chop was tender and wasn't too seasoned so the pork flavor alone was enlightening. The waffle was a perfect sweetness and my eggs were as good as scrambled eggs can be. The portuguese donut it was paired with was cute, light and powdered with sugar. I didn't have much of it because I was already extremely full from the dish, which was bittersweet. I had a iced latte with vanilla and it was great, smooth and sweet. We also had the flight which will get you to that coffee high. I can't remember the names of the brews but the jalapeño one was interesting, though wouldn't be my first choice.  I would recommend the restaurant to any breakfast or coffee aficionado. If I'm ever in the area again I would love to stop by. I hope to try some of their other establishments if ever the opportunity arose."}
{"text":"Vovomeena is a dependable brunch spot in Phoenix with cute outdoor seating and a quick wait time. The biscuits and gravy was everything I wanted and more, with thick, creamy gravy, well-done eggs, and soft, layered biscuits. The savory crepe was nothing exceptional, but the pain perdu (banana bread pudding french toast) was delicious and nothing like any french toast I had every tried before. It came with sausage, rounding out the dish and adding a savory component. I will continue to come back here for the cold-brew coffee and to try their other dishes, particularly the BMOC and the Mexican Benedict."}
{"text":"food was delicious and coffee was delicious!! line had about 15 people ahead of us and took almost 45 minutes to get to the front. I understand having a line on a Saturday morning for brunch, but having one cashier at the front who is doing everything very slowly makes no sense to me. super disappointing :("}
{"text":"Went there for a brunch date yesterday. Service was  fast despite the long lines. I had the Johnnycakes and a chai latte. The johnnycakes were good. I found the syrup to be too sweet for me and the bacon was meh... I never say that about bacon, like ever.   My date had the Mexican Benedict and he enjoyed it."}
{"text":"I really wanted to try the chicken and waffles but it was only part of the special menu. :((........so instead I got the Pawtucket West and the waffle was crunchy on the outside and soft in the inside. It came with scrambled eggs and two slices of bacon. I thought it was reasonably priced considering the location and how nice it was inside."}
{"text":"I decided I needed to finally leave a review after I have been here so many times. My favorite breakfast in Phoenix, hands down best service and food you will get in town. I have always had such positive experiences here, and whenever I have family or friends in town I bring them to vovomeena. I think the quality of each dish is outstanding time and time again, paired with the friendly staff and quick service I am never disappointed. If you come before 8 you won't need to wait too long, but even if you do come in the busier time of day 9:30-12 its worth the wait! Thank you Vovomeena! And as always support local and family owned businesses."}
{"text":"First, and most importantly, the food is fantastic. Biscuits and gravy is everything people raved about on other Yelp reviews. The flavor is great with just a hint of heat. We also tried the Wilcox plate: bacon, house potatoes, plain biscuits, and absolutely perfect eggs. Everything was prepared beautifully and served hot.   The staff was friendly and despite the fact it does look like a less than ideal location from outside, it's a great place once you're through the doors.   I visited with a friend and I'd recommend this location mostly for parties of 2, 4 at the most. There are only a few larger spaces available.   Side note: The first time we tried to eat here it was around 11 on a Saturday and the lines were crazy, both the line to order and the line that you then wait in for your table. We were there with three kids and it was immediately obvious that it would be a long wait before one of the handful of larger tables was available. We decided to leave because it clearly wasn't a great time for a family visit. (At which point we drove over to Luci's at The Orchard and it was a perfect day to sit outside and enjoy their patio along with our kids.)"}
{"text":"This is a beautiful little restaurant. I had the pleasure of meeting Jessica Ruiz, the Front-Gal and co owner of Vovomeena, Tuck Shop and Aster House. This gal is super cool, very inspirational and extremely positive. BTW loved the boots.  I learned more today from their coffee guru's about their craft coffee. Japanese Cold Brew. The process is like an IV drip into grounds, a 12 hour process with no heat. This is old Japanese style coffee making. They have a flight of three available light, medium and bold. Three different beans for each. I remember two of the three beans are Ethiopian and Honduras. This was an excellent iced coffee with pure flavors.  My meal was Corn Jonniecake Flapjacks with a side of sweet rice which looked like a pudding, fresh fruit on top and a couple strips of bacon. $7. A delicious breakfast."}
{"text":"Service was on point. The manager was very friendly and attentive! Also came to check up on me when I was seated outside to make sure everything was good after I ate.  Good is mediocre for price but the atmosphere is nice.  I liked the Orchard French toast but the portion is small-- wish it came with more for the price. Loved the Mascarpone added :)"}
{"text":"I had the pain perdu, which is a banana bread pudding French toast and it was AMAZING. It's more of a dessert than a breakfast item, but nonetheless, it was worth the price. Their coffee is very strong and if you just get plain old coffee, it is bottomless, which for an avid coffee drinker like myself, is definitely a win-win. The service was awesome, and their manager came and checked on me twice even though you don't have a server, which I thought was icing on the cake. It's a quiet enough place to do some work, and by being able to order at the counter instead of having a server, there isn't this huge pressure to leave so the server can make more money. Will definitely return to try the cold brew flight!!"}
{"text":"Food was tasteless.  Potatoes came to the table looking like a soggy mess.  I asked the manager if he could bring out crispy potatoes.  He told me that NO, he could not, because the potatoes were \"pre-made\".   I am sorry, but any restaurant that is unable to throw some potatoes in a pan and crisp them up is no place for us.  We ate one bite of the other items we ordered, were very disappointed, and left."}
{"text":"I went to Vovomeena for the first time today and loved it. I had the Banging Pocket which has Schreiner's banger sausage, scrambled eggs, and smoked gouda in pita bread. It was phenomenal! All of the ingredients taste so fresh. Loved the home-style goodness!  I also had a cafe latte with vanilla. Simple but delicious.  The setup up is very modern and practical. Nice looking art on the walls. The staff was polite and friendly. The bathrooms were also very clean!  I will definitely be going back when I'm on this side of town."}
{"text":"Love this place! So yummy and great menu. Tortilla Espanola and Mexican Benedict are both favorites. Japanese cold brew is awesome. Love the atmosphere."}
{"text":"We have been here two times now and both times the service has been so amazing! The food is wonderful, we each tried something new every time. The manager is so personable and makes an effort to come talk with us and check up on things. Even the customers are all very friendly and I feel very comfortable here."}
{"text":"Solid breakfast, get there early to avoid the line. Locals and tourists had packed the place. Great cold brew and quick service."}
{"text":"3 years later... I added the last star for amazing consistency over the years and I'm a little (just a little) less of snooty punk :p  This place has become a staple. Still just as good every time Service and quality off the charts Still doing the flight of cold brew, Mexican Benedict and Pain Perdu Winning combos..."}
{"text":"Great customer service and excellent food  genuinely enjoyed our first time! We were greeted upon arrival and asked if it was our first time. A kind gentleman then walked us to the menus area showed us the ordering process and helped us with our choice."}
{"text":"Great food and environment! Staff was great, my bf took me for the first time and we will be going back. The biscuits and gravy with an overeasy egg was delish!!"}
{"text":"This small coffee shop was amazing. Great customer service, good vibes and great coffee! I also ate brunch here and the food was delicious. Little on the pricey side, but you get what you pay for. Parking was a little annoying, but we made it work.   I definitely recommend this place if you're looking for a quick bite and some caffeine in a clean, quiet environment."}
{"text":"Food was fantastic!!! This is a hole in the wall place kind of hidden as the entrance is in a small parking lot-no signage on street but a must go! Service was great. They appear to be about different and unique coffee yet the coffee was in self serve dispensers-not my fave but again our good was unique and yummy!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I found this place by chance and we decided to try it, I am glad we did. the Service was amazing , the coffee was great and the food was delicious. They would have gotten 5 stars from me had it not been for the chorizo in the Mexican eggs benedict being a bit greasy where the chorizo grease was completely all over the bottom of the sope. But other than that everything was wonderful. My boyfriend had the B*M*O*C and it also looked delicious. I will definitely be returning to this wonderful little place."}
{"text":"Great food, great coffee, great service. Had the Mexican Benedict. Highly recommended! Love this place."}
{"text":"So-so. Got the biscuits and gravy and my boyfriend got the Mexican eggs Benedict. They were both mediocre. Typical breakfast. The coffee (latte) wasn't terrible, but it wasn't great. Very mediocre in general... came here because of the high reviews... so I was expecting more."}
{"text":"kinda weird at first go up order wait in line then get a table. very good and different breakfast then what I'm use to! would give a 5 star but have to get up and get your own water or any other beverage for that matter. Would definitely go again tho!"}
{"text":"This spot is special.  I love the atmosphere and the modern/hipster vibe I get from here.  My friend got the churrizo eggs Benedict, and I actually forgot what I had lol.  I remember being satisfied though.  The way they have the service set up is that you get seated (or in a cue) once you place your order.  Tables are turned rather fast and food comes out pretty quick as well.  I loved the self serve tea and coffee station they have, it really sets the vibe for Vovomeena and makes you feel like you're in another state/country.  I did have an issue with my plate, however the server immediately gave attention to the matter and swapped it out right away.  I would definitely recommend this restaurant to my friends/fam and can see this being an instant favorite brunch spot!!"}
{"text":"Awesome food and great people watching! Last time my pork chop was a little too salty but still super tender from the brine. Also wish they had an iced coffee option that I didn't have to make myself and maybe some flavor options."}
{"text":"Want great coffee  AND a delicious breakfast? I went with my family before an  AZ Science Center outing on a Sunday morning and we had a little 3yr old in tow! It's an order then sit down place which works pretty well unless there's a group like the 5 of us trying to make up our minds. Sorry everyone! I was tempted by many offerings but  but I got the BMOC which has a porkchop that was smoked and heaven \"scent\" on a waffle with eggs on top of that and a Portuguese donut - I shared this meal with the 3 year old because it is enormous! Hubby got the waffle, son in law got the chorizo egg special, daughter got a tortilla espanola --the meats are superb and come from Schreiner's - I tried the sausage and it had a little spicyness to it and was everything you hope for. It was hard to engage in a conversation because everyone was oohing and ahhin over their breakfast. We loved the flavor of the home fried potatoes too! The donut was light and not like true Malasada's but great for a regular donut. And the baby ate EVERYTHING! I also had a latte and my daughter a cappuccino. This is a great local place with an excellent combo of breakfast AND great coffee -- I don't recall Matt's Big Breakfast offering lattes do you? BONUS! -- we didn't have to wait an hour! This is a great little place -- try it -- you'll like it!"}
{"text":"Vovomeena has restored our faith humanity. The food was great and the wait staff couldn't be more helpful.. Hats off to Kaj and crew. Thanks for making it a great experience, we will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Meh.  Wanted to love this place but even with the cutester name Vovomeena is clearly not in the same foodie league as the far superior Matt's Big Breakfast.   Visited on a Sunday with my 15 year old daughter - located in a strip shopping complex downtown off McDowell. You enter from the back parking lot pavement. Cute inside but honestly nothing that special in terms of decor or ambiance. Unique? Not really.   Daughter ordered the \"Pain Perdu\" Banana Bread Pudding French Toast and I ordered the Tortilla Espanola.   The menu selection honestly left both of us in the dust - looks like the owners are trying way too hard to come up with foodie names and odd mixtures of flavors that make it feel quite limited.  The French Toast arrived and my daughter hated it - she described it as a wet, gloppy, overly sugary soggy mess and said it also tasted like there was meat inside the French Toast (yuck).   After a few bites she sent it back (happily accepted by the friendly staff btw) and got a plain waffle instead (she rated it as fair). She said the bacon was OK but nowhere near as good as Matt's BB. Oh well.   My Tortilla Espnola was decent - probably more potato than egg, a little dry - I've had better. I asked for a little olive oil to serve on top to moisten it a bit - server responded and said the kitchen didn't have olive oil, but \"would I like some vegetable oil instead?\"  A supposedly foodie place that doesn't have olive oil - anywhere? Good grief.   Ignore all the raves at this VERY mediocre spot. This is not and will not be the hot new spot downtown - not even close. LUX does a far better breakfast, so does Coronado Cafe or the reigning champ... Matt's Big Breakfast.   Work on the food and food choices here folks - you guys are trying way too hard.   Good food means simple pleasures prepared and served well. Won't be back."}
{"text":"A quick stop on the way to the airport yielded two very satisfied and happy customers. Mexican Benedict was perfect to split between us. Service was fast, and very friendly. Coffee was well above average. Environment puts this place to the 5 stars. My only regret, not being able to try other menu options. We watched some doses come out of the kitchen with our eyes wide and impressed."}
{"text":"I was visiting my family in Phoenix and we all decided on Vovomeena for breakfast on my last morning there. You line up to order breakfast first and then you are seated. I loved the decor and the relaxed atmosphere.   I decided on the Mexican Benedict and the cold brew sampler. The Mexican Benedict was absolutely delicious with the chorizo on top of the sopes and the potatoes were well seasoned and fluffy. Definitely a must try breakfast item of theirs! I can now understand why it is one of their most popular dishes. I loved the idea of a cold brew sampler in order to try the different flavors they offered. All three flavors I tried: the Black and Tan, peppermint mocha, and orange peel ginger were some of the most flavorful cold brews I've had.   I cannot wait to visit Vovomeena again and try the other breakfast items on their menu! It is a must for breakfast in Phoenix!"}
{"text":"I ordered the BMOC and it was good. The food was fresh and tasted like it was made with great ingredients. The staff also friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"Waffle was made as good good as a waffle iron can make it. Coffee was brewed as good as an expresso maker can make it. If u like self service, generic food,  and overpriced coffee this is the spot. Get there early to avoid lines."}
{"text":"Not your average brunch place. Their medley of flavors and colors is a sight to behold for your senses. Definitely worth checking out if you're in the area... at least for those who have some sense of adventure when it comes to morning fare. That is, assuming you can wade past the crowds that seem to have also discovered this once-quiet place. Darn!"}
{"text":"Second time to Vovomeena- and another excellent breakfast. The cold brew coffee at the front has me believing that they would do pour over coffee, but alas, I was wrong. Just drip coffee. I will move this to 5 stars... If you do pour over coffee :)   Breakfast was great- Mexican Benedict: poached egg over chorizo and a corn cake. Delicious!!!  Will Definately be back again for breakfast."}
{"text":"See the blog for more:  With Aileen and I arriving nearly simultaneously we entered the crisp new space only to be greeted at the front seating area by a pair of baristas standing before the Japanese Cold Brew contraptions and with everyone bright and smiling we were invited to take a seat anywhere we like, eventually settling on a four-top in front of the open kitchen.  Greeted next by our server, a delightful young woman named Hedda, and then by the restaurant's manager it was explained to us that the method of operation was to grab a menu and then order at the counter while coffee is done self-serve and with that in mind we perused the menu and the restaurant's interior before making our selections.  With the space largely empty at such an early hour (but later to fill to capacity as I sat studying till 9:30) we both admired the cozy industrial/shabby chic interior and with The Shins and Minus the Bear amongst the morning soundtrack the restaurant was lively but not loud, though a small group on the outdoor patio seemed to be having quite a good (boisterous) time.  Chatting as we waited it would not be long before the food arrived and purported to have overordered I personally thought everything looked just right when our table was filled - particularly as I sipped on my third cup of the Vovomeena's bold and intensely earthy brew.  Taking notes from various culinary traditions including the Deep South, England, Ireland, Portugal, and more our meal started with a simple buttermilk biscuit topped with salted butter and paired with a side of strawberry rhubarb jam.  With a light crisp to the exterior while the interior crumb was moist and rife with lightly sour notes I partook in the top half of the biscuit while my friend enjoyed the bottom and although good on its own the addition of the jam was definitely more my style.  Moving next to the one dish I'd probably not have ordered if I were visiting on my own, the \"Banging Pocket\" with Shreiner's Banger, Scrambled eggs, and smoked gouda wrapped in a pita was actually quite good, though largely due to the use of quality ingredients more than anything particularly done with them as the pocket of pillowy bread featured a nice balance of fluffy eggs, spicy sausage, and just enough cheese to make it 'stick.'  Neglecting the \"griddled spuds\" on the side largely because I found them a bit too greasy I will note they were quite tender and well complimented by the salt, pepper, and onions.  Noting my propensity for sweet over savory at breakfast it was not until Hedda described the \"Boxty\" that we decided to order it and while it too was just a bit greasy the overall effect of the hot and crisp potatoes juxtaposed against the sour shredded apple and creamy but sweet mascarpone was quite nice.  A sort of sweet meets savory hash brown served with choice of meat I personally would have preferred to see the bacon, also Schreiner's, more thoroughly cooked but that is just a matter of personal preference as the quality of the meat was quite impressive either way.  For the next choice - the most expensive on the menu with good reason - the B.M.O.C. would prove every bit as good as its description would have you to believe.  Beginning at its base with a crispy waffle lightly tinged with vanilla notes and plenty of butter then subsequently topped with apples cooked down in maple syrup, a smoked pork chop, two poached eggs, and finally a crunchy Portuguese donut it would be hard to call this plate anything but gluttonous...or delicious.  In a dish where any number of elements could have shined, what truly set this dish apart for me was actually the chop - a smoky and savory slab of meat that was easily cut with a butter knife and fork and nicely matched by the intense sweetness of the rest of the plate.  Better than the famous \"chop and chick\" at Matt's and less expensive (without the line) this will, and should, become the restaurant's signature in my opinion.  Moving last to the \"dessert for breakfast\" item that had originally drawn me into Vovomeena the day the menu was first published, the pain perdu was simply exceptional.  Featuring dense banana bread rendered into a custard style bread pudding and subsequently sliced to be fried up on the grill this was everything I want from bread pudding - crisp and caramelized on the exterior, soft and dense within, and topped with bold \"whiskey caramel\" sauce plus ripe bananas that push the dish ever-so-close to \"too sweet\" while still keeping things in check, particularly when matched with the Schriener's Sausage.  At $6.95 you'd be hard pressed to find a better breakfast dish in town and having sampled my fair share of bread puddings I'd put this iteration in my top ten."}
{"text":"Happened upon this place after arriving in Phoenix for a long weekend. The only bad part of breakfast was that this place is so far from Chicago. The pain perdue was just sweet perfection. I usually don't like a whole plate of sweet breakfast food, but the caramel drizzle with the bacon was the perfect accompaniment to the French toast. I will absolutely stop back next time I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Service was terrible.  We waited in line forever, and then when we got our food, I received mine expediently, and then my companions didn't get theirs for over 20 minutes.  We did talk with the manager and their food was comp'ed, so that redeemed the situation slightly.  I was also unimpressed with their selection.  Every menu should have something vegan or something that can be made vegan to accommodate those who choose to not consume animal products.  I see two other reviewers highlighted this as an issue.    I'm giving it two stars instead of one because the coffee was good and they had almond milk and stevia for it...although there was no counterspace to make your coffee (for those of us not getting something fancier than just a cup o' joe)."}
{"text":"Never would have found this place if not for yelp and holy freaking moley the biscuits n gravy are on the flavour train!!!! I will not eat biscuits n gravy anywhere else cause what's the point after eating theirs, the cold brew coffee was also the best I have had (nitro excluded) worth a stop just for the coffee! Boomshockalacka!!!!"}
{"text":"They are lucky to get two stars and the only reason for that is there amazing coffee. Food was terrible, seriously major ball drop on the food."}
{"text":"For a quick, gourmet breakfast this place is the spot! I had the apple and mascarpone stuffed french toast and it was just as delicious as it sounds! The food and atmosphere is definately in with the hipster crowd right down to the 19th century hair cuts some of the staff was sportin'.    They do not serve alcohol but they had a coffee and tea bar for those looking for caffiene fix.    The only downfall was that it was very crowded and hard to find a seat.  When you did find a seat you had individuals standing around either looking for their seat, the menu, or in line to order.  However if their only downfall is that they are too busy then I guess they are doing something right!  Will definately be back!"}
{"text":"Good spot for breakfast. Orange juice is not the fresh type just FYI. Got the chorizo Benedict, which was pretty good, but it's also a little spicy so watch out."}
{"text":"Loved the artsy vibe breakfast was bland good but not amazing didn't really like the flys flying around there was quite a few obviously out of the restaurants control. It did make me not enjoy my breakfast fully.I would give this place 3 stars. The service when you ordered was subpar the manager did come to greet the table which was nice would I come here again not my first choice but maybe someday I'll give it another shot."}
{"text":"Very good! Just got off the plane and was recommended here. My friend here in Phoenix recommended this restaurant to meet for Breakfast as they had good reviews on YELP. I must say She was correct. The menu was pleasantly different. There was a line you had to go through to order and as you went through you could see the Cooks preparing the different items and you could ask them what the item was. Excellent idea!! The food was great! We will be back!"}
{"text":"First time here was amazing! Three sister omelette was best I have ever had!! And I love good food! Every thing was a plus: the food, the service, the staff, short wait time for food on a really busy morning, and they have a barista for delicious coffee drinks.  My new breakfast spot."}
{"text":"I pass Vovoveema all the time; it was one of those brunch places that remained a mystery to me because they specialize in unconventional brunch dishes. For instance, their signature dish is a B.M.O.C. a huge pork chop with a waffle, eggs, and Portuguese donuts on the side! As curious as it sounded, we decided to save the extra pounds and try their Biscuits and Gravy as well as the Pain Perdu instead.  Both were delicious! The gravy tasted home-cooked and had all the components of comfort food. I thought it tasted something of a distant cousin to a chicken pot pie. The Pain Perdu was one of the largest most delicious French toast I've ever had. It was oozing of bananas, and I was surprised I kept eating it bite after bite!  Finally, we also ordered a coffee flight and had a chance to sample three iced coffees sourced locally in Phoenix. They were made using a Japanese cold-brewing method; I'd recommend trying it, because the taste does differ from cold brews, and if you're already at Vovoveema, why not? Come to Vovoveema if you'd like to take your taste buds on a different journey off the traditional brunch path."}
{"text":"This is a great little spot that seemed to be hopping with trendy folk. The menu was fu and relatively diverse. Tried the bread pudding, bmoc, and cold brew coffee flight. I'd get the bmoc again, but pass on the others (the coffee was all very over-roasted). I'd like to go back for the Mexican eggs Benedict.   Service was fabulous and friendly. Looking forward to a second visit!!"}
{"text":"Vovomeena is really good. I've gotten their \"giant stack of assorted delicious\" item a couple of times now, and it features eggs, meats, and even a portugese donut. Oh, and a pork chop. There's a lot going on.  I wish that they were a bit more flexible with the menu. They're very clear about no substitutions, which they're doing in an attempt to ramp up the \"fast service\" style that they're aiming for, but it rules out a few menu options for me I'd otherwise be really excited to try, and that's a bit of a bummer.  The service was really good the first time we went. The second time, we had a hiccup where my meal had gotten lost in the ether, so I didn't get to eat until after my entire party was pretty well done with their food. But mistakes occasionally happen, so no real love lost.  Overall, it's pretty damn tasty, and a fun experience. And TONS of food. Worth swinging by."}
{"text":"If you've read my reviews of Tuck Shop or Astor House, you knew I would be at Vovomeena within a week of them opening.  My dad and I made breakfast plans and he requested Astor House.  I let him know they opened a new place right by Easley's we had to try instead.  He happily obliged. Vovomeena is a saving grace for an awesome brick center that was face-lifted to house small chain eateries.  I shouldn't be so hard; I love Zoyo too.  Just like Astor House (and the other eateries there), Vovomeena is order at the counter and a staff member will bring you your food.  I recommend finding an open table before ordering and claiming it with sunglasses or a book.  We were there the weekend after it opened and open tables were sparse.  I'm sure by the time I finally got around to writing my review (two months later) that it must be much busier and tables even more sparse. I woke up that day craving biscuits and gravy; so I naturally ordered the biscuits and grillades.  See my Astor House review if you want to know more about this tasty dish.  (It's just as awesome in the aves).  At a little nudging from me, my dad ordered the BMOC - Big Man On Campus.  Heck yes!  A deliciously rich waffle topped with the best pork chop I have ever had, over medium eggs, syrup, and a Portuguese donut for good measure.  I knew the waffle would be bomb because I've had the waffles at Tuck Shop (you can read about those too in my Tuck Shop review).  This pork chop was heavenly.  I'm telling you that I'm seriously planning to make pork loin with maple syrup in homage to this pork chop at Christmas.  Cut it with a fork smoked tender meat... oh my goodness!  I don't know that I could ever finish a BMOC on my own, but was happy to eat some of my dad's.  The donut was a perfect dessert my dad and I shared at the end.  Light and fluffy with a taste reminiscent of funnel cake.   Vovomeena has that amazing cold brewed coffee chocked full of the caffeine I love.  Fantastically attentive and friendly staff - probably from all that cold brewed coffee. The space is that modern, industrial chic that we all love.  There's a buffet table near one of the entrances we thought was the hostess stand before we determined it was also counter order and seat yourself - my only complaint.  Though it is not really a complaint.   I can't wait to go back and try more.  I'm disappointed in myself that I was so hell bent on having grillades that day, I didn't get to try two brand new dishes.  Luckily, it's just down the street."}
{"text":"Outstanding breakfast burrito and Americanos. I will make this my only stop if I am in the area. Fresh cooked (not microwaved), fresh vegetables and eggs. Good portions and fantastic flavor. Please do try it, as I want this local spot to stay open for ever.  I even stop by for a mid-day Americanos because they are soo smooth and the barista pulls the shots just right. Keep it Local!"}
{"text":"My fiancé found this place for me. He knows I love to try new places to satisfy my food cravings. My friend from out of state came to visit and I decided to bring her here with me for my first time experience, since she's into coffee & food in general too!  We ordered the Mexican Benedict, B.M.O.C., a flight of coffee, and iced coffee. The food was everything that I expected it to be. The chorizo was very tasty, but wasn't right for my taste buds at that time. It was my first time have poached eggs and I loved it. The bmoc was great, the taste was just mouth watering.   We didn't realize we ordered so much coffee. The flight, iced coffee and iced latte! We definitely left with a coffee high.   This place was delightful. I will bring my fiancé for brunch soon. Even though it's kind of pricey, the coffee is what I would come back for!"}
{"text":"If you haven't been to Vovomeena, your mouth has never been truly satisfied! Not only do they have amazing food, they have GREAT coffee. The thing that actually stands out the most is their customer service! Im an admitted coffee snob/foodie and they have, on more than one occasion, made sure to go above and beyond, delivering the best experience!"}
{"text":"The corner of 7st and McDowell is another hot spot for many stores and restaurants.They all shared the same parking lot. There are a few parking spaces in the back lot near the Easley's Fun House side.   As most popular brunch places, coming on a Sunday afternoon, this place was extremely packed. They have 2 entrances front and back. It can be confusing if you entered from the back since no sign or service directing you until you walked to the front seeing a long waiting line.   You place the order and paid at the counter then they bring the food to your table. You can watch them preparing the food while you order. It's an open kitchen. They do have outside seating area shared with other businesses.   I tried the special eggs Benedict on board and the Japanese cold brew. It was a basic hearty meal but nothing special. The Japanese cold brew was just ok. It didn't fully capture the coffee flavors that I am used to in a Japanese cold brew. Their Portuguese donut was decent but I felt overpriced ($1.50 for a really small piece).  Overall, it's great little place in a vibrant changing neighborhood."}
{"text":"Coffee is soooo good. cool spot. I got the Mexican eggs Benedict... it was good.... a bit too much chorizo for me... but it was good."}
{"text":"The service was great and the food was amazing. Stopped by here for breakfast on a Wednesday morning. There was seating due to the flow of patrons in spite of it being packed. The host quickly attended to us upon walking in to give us a quick how to on ordering at the register and self-seating. The menu had a small but perfect amount of selections. It was difficult to choose because each dish was unique and sounded delish. The burrito had a fresh taste - and I typically do not like burritos.  I'm going back for another for sure. The side of potatoes were perfectly cooked - some had a crisp to them.  The Johnny cakes were amazing! The corn and the overall texture/flavor was on point. Kudos to the chef for the creativity and palette. The decor is modern eclectic with a relaxed friendly vibe. This place is a must!"}
{"text":"PROS Tasty brunch! We were fans of the thick cut porkchop and crispy waffle, and the Mexican benedict.  Right amount of spices and seasoning Patio seating for dog people Service and manager were attentive and courteous   CONS The flow for  brunch is awkward, it's counter service so you order the food but then the manager seats you.  Space is very narrow Have to get your own coffee  Overall, I recommend this place for a brunch. Easier if it's a small group since seating can be a little more competitive than what I would like it to be. We are East Valley people so will only dine here if we have events or errands in downtown."}
{"text":"If you have not been here.... it is a must try! We ordered like four different entrees and each one was delicious. This is my new brunch place."}
{"text":"stopped in Phoenix on the way to California and this is seriously the best breakfast place I've ever been to in the whole U.S!!! I had the 3 sister omelet with spuds and man oh man was it delicious. They have fresh orange juice and perfectly made coffee!!"}
{"text":"I did not end up eating here. I came on a Sunday late morning and my boyfriend and i spent 15 minutes waiting awkwardly in a corner of the restaurant for a table or seat of any kind to open up before ordering an entire breakfast. When I finally found a 2 top I was told bluntly (by someone who conveniently ignored us standing and wandering around inside and out) that I had to order before I could take a table. It was loud and crowded and although the food smelled great it wasn't worth feeling so unwelcome."}
{"text":"Delicious! Our first time, on our way to Veteran's parade! Gave us 1/2 off our total bill for my husband's service! Will fill in details later! Very impressed!"}
{"text":"I fear that this place is going to get out of hand very shortly.  Please people keep to Matt's Big Breakfast and Over Easy keep the crowds away.    Ok Ok I can't be selfish but I wish I could this place is awesome.    Everything from the Japanese cold brew coffee to the espresso's to the amazing food.  I have had the pain perdu which is bannana bread french toast fresh bannanas sliced on top and a whiskey caramel sauce on top and the savory crepes with chicken and egg inside and a homemade sauce over the top.  Both dishes were AMAZING I will for sure go back just for those, but will have to try the rest of the menu first.    I am very greatful I have Monday and Tuesday's off to avoid the weekend crowds because I am sure they will be starting very soon."}
{"text":"My sister got the mexican benedict. She said it was super hot yet tasty :)   I got the tortilla espanola, ehhhh. The salad was very tangy and has a wierd after taste, it was similar to lasagna really, but other than that my plate was good. :) their house made orange juice was really good. Perfect.  I didn't like the set up how you have to get up and order. I love the fresh sun flowers on the tables :)"}
{"text":"I love this restaurant. Been here many times. I've had several dishes including the banging pocket, Mexican Benedict, as well as the French toast. So good. Iced coffee is delicious as well."}
{"text":"What a find! Had the orchard french toast husband had the biscuits and gravy. No wait and quick food times. very quaint interior. Staff was very friendly. Glad we found this place."}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time based on the good reviews and enjoying Tuck Shop, however this was a pretty epic fail   We arrive at the restaurant and were told by the barista how the menu and ordering works, and we placed our order of the mandatory BMOC and the grillades, and supplemented that with a Coconut Macaroon (not the French hard shell style) that looked good at the counter. We ordered hot green tea and a cappa  The macaroon was mainly coconut with very little cake to it, which was fun for a bit or two, then was one note and disappointing...which was a common theme  The tea came in a regular bag (which was a little bit disappointing for a place that touts their coffee, you would think tea would be more than an afterthought, and then the cappa - which ended up being an espresso covering in foam in a full sized coffee mug. It was clear the barista had no idea what they were doing, I am sure there is a name for espresso doted with foam but it was not in the right cup nor was it what I ordered - that was disappointing. They seem to specialized in cold brew and had 5 or 6 of them going, so maybe that is all they are good at, it certainly isn't making a milk based coffee drink  The food looked good upon coming out however and the first bite of the BMOC was pretty good, the waffle with syrup and apples was done properly and the pork chop was a good piece of meat, the egg was cooked well. The issue was that it was unbalanced when the components were eaten seperatly and one note when eaten together. The pork chop was salty and a bit oversmoked, so for a bite or two it was great, then it was boring.  The grillades was pretty poor all the way around, the biscuit's were not very good and the meat was simple pressed ground beef and it was overly salty, the gravy was not that appealing, a pretty poor rif on traditional biscuit's and gravy  about 1/3rd of the way through the meal we decided we were wasting calories and it was time to go  If you want a great waffle and pork chop - Matt's Big Breakfast is pretty amazing upon comparison - I had wanted to try this place to give it a comparison, and it really makes Matt's stand out, simplicity done well is very hard and they do it there, not so much at Vovomeena"}
{"text":"First thing as you walk in the Japanese brewing method quickly catches your eye, the service is outstanding and the food is beyond delicious. I myself chose the the three sister omelet and a flight of the house infused coffee. Please don't sell yourself shot, buy the flight. If your definitely looking for a great local spot with local brewed coffee this is the place for you, atmosphere here is great and will not be disappointed with anything on the menu."}
{"text":"Our second time here. We just love the Vibe here and the food is very special."}
{"text":"Great little casual, urban hip restaurant with inspired, hand crafted food. Went there for Sunday breakfast & was very satisfied with the tasty crepes with chicken and swiss chard. Funky twist on crepes & pretty healthy. (A welcome departure from bacon & eggs.) Homemade salsa & sausages unusual. Impressive selection of coffees & cold coffee is properly brewed \"Japanese style,\" not just poured over ice. Nice patio seating. Good vibe!"}
{"text":"Yo this is my jam.  Favorite place to eat breakfast never am disappointed. High quality ingredients bomb coffee.  Always get the omelet cause it's straight fire. Add a donut for extra happiness."}
{"text":"I came here for breakfast after a long night out. Staff was really nice and food was solid. I got the biscuits and gravy. Nothing to write home about but definitely solid. I don't remember what the other people I was with got but they seemed happy as well.  4/5. Would be back."}
{"text":"Known in folklore as a cure-all, the Vovomeenian johnnycake smorgasbord (not the right word to use, since it means bread and butter, but let's just run with it) offers life-replenishing powers for uninspired, hung over, and weary brunch soldiers. The legend says... \"Add four poached eggs to this. And a Portuguese doughnut.\"   So I did. The dish is just called \"johnnycakes.\" You know, john·ny·cake - noun - a flat cornmeal cake typically baked or fried on a griddle.  I received two, plate-sized. Studded with corn. Stacked with fresh strawberries. Oh, and scoop of sweet rice pudding. Plus, two sausages. And a pitcher of prickly pear maple syrup. So, when you order the johnnycakes, know that it may be a working title, and that the definition is approximate at best.   Use this flexibility to your advantage and continue adding brunch items with reckless abandon. Don't think about it.* I recommend four poached eggs and a doughnut.  *Unless you have something to do in the next four hours, besides for nap."}
{"text":"I stopped here for breakfast at 6:30 am when they opened yesterday and the place had the prettiest decor! The food was great I had the Mexican eggs benedict. It was amazing, too bad I couldnt finish it all. My dining companion had the waffle that was amazing, as well. I had my first cold pressed coffee that was out of this world. I will for sure be back."}
{"text":"I really liked this place.  I got the BMOC and enjoyed it for the most part.  I think the promise of a big porkchop got me thinking of a regular grilled pork chop, but this was cured like ham.... so it was essentially a big chop of ham.  It was still tasty... and I probably should have expected ham for brunch instead of a regular seasoned porkchop.... but yeah.  Aside from that minor, brief disappointment, the meal was filling and good.    One of my friends got a french toast dish... totally sweet and delicious... and probably best as a dessert.  Another friend got the mexican benedict dish which was quite flavorful.    The flight of coffee samplers were interesting... especially the lemon/jalepeno coffee.    Nothing life-changingly amazing, but a very solid brunch place."}
{"text":"My buddy wanted to get breakfast on my side of town and wanted to give Vovomeena a go cause he had heard great things.  First I'll start with how hip this place is, very cool atmosphere.  You order at the counter and they run the food out to you.  The prices were adorable and the portions were decent size for the affordable price.  I ordered the Waffle, Bacon and Potatoes and at $8.95 it was priced accordingly.  It was yummy, real maple syrup would be a good addition vs. the corn syrup buttersworth/jemima one they served.    All in all this would be a nice place to catch breakfast/brunch if you're in the area.  Gonna be honest and say Matt's is still the king of breakfast in my neck of the woods, but Vovomeena is quite pleasant."}
{"text":"Found this spot looking breakfast on yelp. I am a coffee lover so the flight of coffee was appealing to me. Unfortunately they were out of infused coffee now that they are supplying a coffee shop. I did try their Japanese cold brewed and immediately fell in love. I tried the tortilla espanola and my friend got the breakfast pocket. Both were terrific especially the tortilla espanola! Highly recommended and definitely try the coffee."}
{"text":"I found myself with a morning free and contacted a very good AOB buddy of mine, T, and asked him if he wanted to join me for coffee and a bite to eat. \"Sure, but I only have an hour or so. Where do you want to meet?\" He said. Hmm, he lives about 2 miles away from Vovomeena and I had bookmarked this place a while ago so it seemed like a good time to give it a try. First of all, let's deal with the location. No problem for me. Personally, I typed the address into Google Maps and let the software do its thing. I read some people were unhappy because Vovomeena was hard to find. I guess they don't have a cell phone with Google Maps, or a computer at home with same, or GPS in their car, or... seriously. If you can't find a place that has an address, who's fault is it? Bash the establishment? It just makes you look silly. The place is on the South East corner of McDowell and 7th Ave. It's there. Just pull in and park, you'll find it. Once you're inside you'll be happy you went through all the hard work it was to find Vovomeena in the first place. OK, I'm being sarcastic. The innards are cool. Simply laid out with a coffee bar as you walk in. And it serves Japanese Cold Drip Coffee so if you're a fan, get some. There's also a good variety of other coffee's according to my friend so the variety should satisfy most coffee drinkers. Plenty of Yelpers have pointed out how you order and blah blah blah, so I'm not going to go over it again. I felt the guy behind the counter who took our order was very pleasant. I had a few questions about the menu since I was a Vovomeena virgin and he gave me all the insight I needed. We chatted about nothing in particular and he seemed like a very pleasant person. We had already grabbed a table in back before we ordered so once our orders were in T got himself some coffee and I opted for the fresh orange juice. Yummy stuff. The orange juice that is. I don't drink coffee.  I had the Banging Pocket ($9.95). This thing is huge. I was very impressed with the portion size. A delicious pita stuffed with scrambled eggs, sliced Schreiner's sausage, and smoked gouda. I felt everything worked together well. Winner winner Pita dinner. Could it have used maybe some other ingredients? Sure, I'm a chef. But I think the focus here is showcasing the Schreiner sausage, which this \"sandwich\" did. I enjoyed it. If you read the ingredients on the menu and think it should have something else, ask. There were also some lovely breakfast type potatoes alongside. T ordered the Pain Perdu ($9.50). It's a banana bread pudding French toast with Whiskey caramel sauce. He said it was pretty good. It looked good. He ate the whole thing. There were a couple of, let's say, hiccups however. The plastic varnish coating on out table was peeling away. That's because the sanitizer, cleaner and whatever else they might spray on it to wipe it down does nasty stuff to the top coat of the tables. Another issue is that since T and I ordered separately our food didn't come out together. T ordered first and I asked the guy taking the orders if he could just put my order under the same number. Nope. No can do. So the food didn't come out together. In fact, the food came out way to far apart. 3 - 5 minutes. Unacceptable. Both are easy fixes though.  Great Food. Fair Prices. Pleasant Staff. Timing issues. Furniture in need of repair/replacement. 4 Stars."}
{"text":"Props for the awesome decor and vibe but we thought the food was just OK for brunch; bland and nothing to write home about. Plus, we waited in a long line to order our food (30 mins) and by the time we got up front to order they were out of the  top 3 items I was considering to order."}
{"text":"Yummy!!! This place was quick and quaint just like I love it! The service, food and people were all good. We ordered your traditional breakfast of eggs, pancakes, potatoes and sausage and it was all good. My waffles were the best I've had in a very long time. Being fluffy and buttery was a complete party in my mouth. The coffee, vanilla latte and fresh squeezed orange juice was superb as well. Well done. Next time I'm in Phoenix I will be back."}
{"text":"Vovomeena having amazing breakfast and was the best breakfast that I have in my vacation to Tuscon, Phoenix & Sedona.  My parents normally have a traditional chinese breakfast and they love the food here too.  The  pain perdu - a bread pudding French toast - looks and tasted delicious as posted by many Yelpers and I agree.  I also order the Mexican Benedict and was really good.  I really wanted to swing back again before my trip was over but unfortunately I was not able to make it.  The sausages was good meat.  Ordering  & Seating can get confusing for newbie : So here is a recap (please click helpful)   1) There is a front (Bigger parking lot) & back entrances (smaller parking lot - you see the coffee barrister & the restroom if you enter thru here - go to front to order.). 2) Don't get a seat ,  you have to \"ORDER FIRST\" before you get seated ( The ordering is near the front entrance ) 3) After you order and paid you get a NUMBER. 4) You take that NUMBER and get on another line by the wall  across from the coffee barrister This is where the manager will find seats for you. 5) The process seem to be okay as I was able to get at seat 10 mins after I order and paid. 6) After I got seated , I probably got my food in another 8-10 mins.      For the great food, I feel okay for this process."}
{"text":"I love breakfast and was really anticipating vovomeena.  But was quite disappointed. Service was rude. For example; I asked if there was an alternative to the meat sides..... The gals answers was. \"You can not have it.\".... Wow. Thanks.    Food was nothing to brag about.  Can't say that I feel the need to return or recommend this spot."}
{"text":"I love everything about this restaurant! As a new yorker i am always pleasantly surprised when the service is exceptional and this service was exceptional.  So you wait on line to order your food before getting seated. We were a party of 7 and they were nice enough to seat us towards the back by ourselves.   From the other reviews on yelp I ordered the banana french toast and it was delicious. If you have a sweet tooth definitely go for this. I also really appreciate the potatoes that came with it since it added the right amount of savory to my sweet dish. I had thought i ordered a donut and the waitress went to check on it for me. When she came back she told me I actually didnt order it but they made an extra and gave it to me. Legit almost started crying 1. because i cant believe i forgot to order the donut. i love donuts! and 2. that she just gave me one.  I dont remember what my friends ordered but they all really enjoyed their food and we all enjoyed our donuts! It was light fluffy and had a healthy dusting of sugar!  The service was great and they never rushed us to leave even though we were a big party and took up a rather large table. I'll definitely remember this place the next time I'm back in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Fantastic!  Found this place on Yelp for my first meal in town and the daily special breakfast quesadilla blew me away.  So tasty.  I'm from the south so I don't know much but I know these guys and gals know their stuff!  Ingredients, flavors, and texture on point. So good!"}
{"text":"Well worth the wait!!! This place has the best breakfast around amazing coffee and great customer service. My friends and I were out for spring training baseball and came across this place. This will now be a must for future spring training trips. Thank you for the wonderful breakfast. See you again"}
{"text":"I'm stuck on the banana-bread pudding french toast with whisky caramel and a side of meat..\"Pain Perdu!\"  http://bit.ly/1IezYOM  Does this come as a surprise!? Others with whom I've dined have enjoyed their meals as well - and that BMOC is the BOMB.   Love it when one of my favorite restaurants for dinner (Tuck Shop) turns out to be owned by the same folks as one of my favorite breakfast spots. I didn't realize that the owners were the same until my second visit to Vovo and it was then that I caught on. (Now I just have to try their other place, \"The Astor House.\")  Vovomeena is counter-order, delivered to your table kind of breakfast place. The queue has always been at least seven to ten deep, but it moves quickly and the food pops out pretty quickly. The menu is unique, diverse and the portions are pretty reasonable for the price point and uniqueness of the dish. The service has always been chatty and memorable. I like it!  The main downfall is that the seating can be somewhat cramped; always prefer the patio but it can easily become too cold or warm. Likewise, the parking lot is certifiably \"for maniacs only\" - it is very tight. There is limited street parking on Lynwood  - residential street south of the parking lot.   Speaking of this area and specifically the street just mentioned - part of the historic \"Roosevelt District\" and it's a niceafter-breakfast idea to take a stroll and to walk off that meal!"}
{"text":"This is such a great breakfast/brunch place.  I love it.  The food is fresh and well cooked- not the kind of place that just serves prepared Cisco Foods.  A little pricy but worth it.  I got the Mexican Benedict and it was HEAVENLY.  They also have great coffee and fresh squeezed orange juice.  I basically felt like I got a mini vacation today when I had breakfast there.  The only con is it's a small place, so you might have to wait to get a table."}
{"text":"This is the best breakfast place EVER! The hubby had Mexican Benedict and I had the savory crepes. I would have to say hands down the food was delish and fresh brewed coffee was awesome. Thanks to our friends for introducing this restaurant to us."}
{"text":"The orchard French toast are seriously outrageous!! The restaurant itself is super clean and their staff is beyond friendly. It was pretty busy when we went but it was worth the wait!"}
{"text":"It was pretty good. I had the B.M.OC,pork chop was good. That being said,waffle was soggy from too much syrup. The eggs were well,eggs. The donut thing was ok all in all it was ok I'll go back to try something else. Oh and the coffee was pretty good."}
{"text":"Excellent restaurant all around. The coffee tastes so fresh. I had the banana pudding French toast with caramel sauce on top and bacon on the side. That's one of the best breakfast meals I have ever had. Love the way the atmosphere flows through the restaurant. Just a terrific place to go to."}
{"text":"I went to Vovomeena with the BF last weekend to have breakfast. The place is cute, small, but not cramped. The style is modern. You come in and order at a counter and then seat yourself, which is nice. I got the Mexican eggs benedict. It was rich and heavy, but had good flavor. It is chorizo on top of a thick corn cake of sorts...then topped with eggs and hollandaise. I think I probably gained at least a pound from this meal. The only problem with the food was the potatoes were somewhat bland. Thankfully, the serving size was huge so I didn't miss having the potatoes."}
{"text":"First time here! So good! The line was out the door but totally worth the wait. Took half an hr to get in. The staff was great, very organized"}
{"text":"Vovomeena is not for non-meat eaters. The menu is limited and offers little flexibility for vegetarians. Also, they have no fish or avocado on the menu. The tortilla was over cooked and bland, and was definitely not Spanish as suggested in the menu.   Vovomeena is also not for folks expecting decent customer service. If you're a disabled woman asking for a glass of water, then don't be surprised if you're asked to head to the water cooler and help yourself - \"I don't bring water to the customers. Customers do it themselves\"   Overall, extremely disappointed and would recommend to stay away!"}
{"text":"Vovomeena why were you so hard to find!!! Whether you're driving down McDowell or 7th avenue you won't see it. Maybe we just missed it, but I didn't see any sign whatsoever. The only one was right about their door, but you can't see it well from the street. We got lost and drove around and couldn't find it. I had to text my sister to see where it's at.   I ordered the banging pocket which I didn't think was very banging. Lol. It comes with sausage and eggs wrapped in a pita with a side of potatoes. It would've been nice with some onions or mushrooms or something. It just wasn't anything great.   There isn't a lot of seating at the restaurant. You probably have to come early to get a table or you'll end up sitting outside in the hot weather. They should really install misters. The service was really good but it was a far drive for mediocre food."}
{"text":"Cute lil coffee house vibe , Im not vegan but i dont eat pork , and the cook everything griddle style. On the plus side they did custom a egg scramble for me but ( on the negative) wouldn't do just egg whites ."}
{"text":"My new go to breakfast place. Love the banana bread french toast. Just wish you could order a small order as a side dish. Great food, great atmosphere!"}
{"text":"It's good but some options are either too bland or overly sweet - it just didn't do it for my taste buds"}
{"text":"Everything was delicious. Bisquits and gravy, eggs benedict cooked to perfection. Eat the donut too!"}
{"text":"I was really impressed with the speed at which the food came out. It was hot and very delicious. The prices are good and the staff is friendly."}
{"text":"Amazing coffee, and even better breakfast.  My two favorites are the benedict and the pain perdu. I highly suggest going with a friend and splitting the two, because the pain perdu is VERY sweet.  The service is amazing, impressed every time I come."}
{"text":"Lovely hidden treasure in downtown phoenix. Very casual concept that just seems to work no matter how crowded it is. Great customer service and a nice relaxing atmosphere. Good amount of parking very clean inside and out. The food is from local source and is simple but very tasty and you get a healthy serving as well. No doubt we will return!"}
{"text":"We stumbled on this place via yelp, when we looked for an open breakfast place when we arrived in Arizona for a vacation. Our flight came in early. We found this, was not totally easy to find (blame it on the GPS) but when we did, we were in for a surprise. The place is hip, the food was great, and the service is exceptional. There were food choices that were among things I was not familiar with so I was willing to try out. We ordered 2 different items. They came out really well, except that I am not a big fan of waffles and, well, I ordered waffles. It was a little too sweet, being that it was mixed with some compote or apple-something. Otherwise, it was good. Outside of food, the service was great. The manager and food server were there helping us out as we figured where to go on our visit. You cant find that easily elsewhere-- staff members, who are willing to talk to you.  Do check this place out if you want good food and wonderful people in AZ!"}
{"text":"It was our first time coming here and I got to tell you it was pretty tasty, the atmosphere and the vibe was awesome which is always a plus. I ordered the Wilcox Avenue which were scrambled eggs,spuds(potato)and bacon with a biscuit I got the biscuit for the side of gravy I ordered which is some pretty good gravy actually the gravy is what got us to this fine establishment , My wife ordered the Mexican chorizo Benedict which she said was good but, a little spicy for her. I think she'll try something else next time. I already know what I'm going to order for next time. Coffees great and also this watermelon iced tea. Well let's see what you think after you try this place out"}
{"text":"This menu. Too many delicious recommended options to choose from - don't miss out on the cold brew coffee flight!"}
{"text":"Great food, great service. I ordered food and was closer than I thought. Was there in 5 mins and it was ready and coffee was amazing also."}
{"text":"Wow! Just WOW!! You need to try this place. If you love breakfast at all, you need Vovomeena in your life. For your first trip I HIGHLY recommend trying the B.M.O.C. It sounds weird (I mean a pork chop on a waffle with an egg?) but it will change your life. For the better. And their infused coffee, delish. Or if plain ole joe is more up your alley, they have bottomless cups of freshly brewed local beans. Also, they use Schrieners sausage. Nuff said. Oh and the people there are awesome! Super nice, welcoming, make you feel like a regular even if it's your first time!   In summation, go to Vovomeena. You will thank me."}
{"text":"Trendy, snug place. Generally when I've been there, there's a line to order, but it's okay! You're greeted in line with a menu by a Host. Then after you place your order at counter, the Host will seat you with your number. Then bam!, food comes out. I got the bacon breakfast sandwich and boy did they deliver on the bacon!"}
{"text":"It's a cool little place. The food is mostly good and the service is decent. I wasn't super impressed by the donut but the waffle is pretty yummy. Their seating policy isn't great and that's one of the reasons we don't go here more often."}
{"text":"Small place with amazing food and even better coffee.  Can be busy at times, but worth the wait for sure.  If traveling through Phoenix this is definitely a place to try at least once, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Loved this place! Coffee was top notch and the food was quite good.  didn't even mind the lines-signaled to me that we'd enjoy our feast.  Only thing for me personally-I'm allergic to dairy and I had NO choices.  They had to adapt the one item that came close to safe."}
{"text":"The kiddo, daddy and I went to this magical spot for breakfast mid morning on a Sunday. The place is cute, a little small, but has inside and outside seating. You order at the counter first, then wait for the manager to seat you. Between the three of us we ordered the Mexican eggs Benedict, pain perdu (French toast), kid's egg/bacon/pancake, fresh oj, and a Portuguese doughnut.   Let's start out with the reason I will come back... the Portuguese doughnut was one of the best doughnuts I've ever had! You'll find it on the bottom of the menu, \"add a Portuguese doughnut to your order (duh!) 1.50\". Well said guys! Get one!   Second on the list is the pain perdu which my hubby ordered. He would only share two bites and I was reluctantly understanding. I wouldn't have wanted to share it either! I was a little disappointed with the chorizo on my Benedict. It was overly greasy and a little spicy for me (just preference).   Worth a try friend!"}
{"text":"This new breakfast/brunch place from the Tuck Shop owners is the lone gem in a row of typical chain restaurants at the SE corner of McDowell and 7th Avenue. By coincidence, I ended up eating here three Sundays in a row. So, I've been able to sample a variety of entrees from their menu--which isn't all your typical eggs and bacon. That's a good thing in this case. My favorite so far is their Tortilla Espanola_ the perfect texture and combination of potato and egg with a brava sauce. They also offer Portuguese donuts. They are OK. They are like funnel cakes but seem to be made from a lot more egg. The set-up is pretty in and out. You look at the menu and line up to place your order. If you order a beverage, you move over to the coffee bar after paying for your order.   Besides the scrumptious menu, I love the decor. They have space on the patio and a bike rack. Inside, there are floor-to-ceiling ropes smartly placed between people dining and people lining up to make their orders. I also like the hanging shelves of glass bottles behind the coffee bar. The brick and industrial materials gives the place a modern and simple feel.  I recommend getting there before 11 a.m. That's about when it starts getting pretty crowded. There is no signage out front so it's easy to miss. Parking is accessible on 7th Avenue, just south of McDowell."}
{"text":"Food is fabulous!   The Portuguese Benedict was cooked perfectly, and the pain Perdue is like a banana bread smashed with a Cinnabon and topped with Carmel goodness.   Would give 5 stars but Coffee tasted burnt and the music isn't my thing. Could have been more loungey for the space.  Big band blaring just made people start talking louder during crescendos.  Amendment: after posting my review the manager contacted me to let me know he appreciated the constructive criticism. This is what small business owners should do. Listen, make yourself better through appreciating that your customers want to make you better. 5 stars in my book."}
{"text":"I've been raving about this place, letting everyone know to come to this little neighborhood breakfast gem.  It is behind some restaurants, but a great find. It catches your eye when you see a line out the door!    As you go to order, food is being prepared right in front of you.   I ordered what people talk about, the Pain Perdu.  The thing that stuck out for me was the Whiskey caramel sauce!  It covers the banana bread pudding french toast and is accompanied with two thick slices of bacon.  It is topped with slices of fresh banana.    Some very comforting dishes if you are in the mood for something sweet or down right tasty they have it all.  Also ordered was the mexican benedict.  It was made with deliciously poached eggs, having a mix chorizo, tomato, onion, it had memorable flavor.   Reasonable breakfast prices with tasty selections."}
{"text":"Very tasty!  If you are in the mood for comfort food, this is the place. I enjoyed brunch there a few weeks ago with my mom. We both something sweet with a side of savory meat. I had the Johnnycakes which is like a corn pancake with prickly pear syrup. Mom had the boxty which is apple and potato pancake with mascarpone.  We were full for the entire rest of the day I believe.  So satisfying!  There weren't too many healthy things on the menu, but I don't think that's what we were looking for.  Excellent cappuccino too!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing (: Love what they done within a small space ! Everything in here looks modern! The food taste of the food is well worth the price you pay. In my opinion I think this food is well priced for the flavorful meal! I hope everything best for this companies success! Hope that they move in a more profitable area! Would love to see this place all around the Phoenix area! Oh and the girlfriend said your food is awesome! Will be back for more!"}
{"text":"Small, local breakfast eatery.  Needed a breakfast fix after a long trip.  Where else to turn, but to my fellow Yelpers.  It is a little hidden from the street, but an excellent find.   Vovomeena has no pretenses.  Pick a menu, order at the counter/cashier, get a number and wait.  If you don't know the drill you might feel a bit lost at first.   The small outdoors dining area is quaint and shared with other businesses.  The morning dine time was quiet and peaceful.   Ordered the Johnny Cakes.  These are 2 large corn 'pancakes'.  Fresh corn and green chiles are dotted throughout, with strawberries on top.  Crispy on the outside, moist and flavorful inside.  A definite recommendation.  These are served with sweet rice and a choice of bacon and sausage.  The sausage had a good bite with plenty of texture.  Nice. The rice seemed like an afterthought, but was tasty nonetheless.   Overall a good dining experience and recommended for a delicious meal."}
{"text":"Amazing food and everyone was so nice that I created a Yelp account to write about how helpful everyone was.  I can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"I'm so glad to have a fun neighborhood spot to go to for brunch! We came here on Saturday morning. We must have arrived with a big wave of people, because there were about 8 people in line waiting to order food in front of us. (FYI - this was rare, the rest of the time we were there, there wasn't more than 3 or 4 people waiting in line) We didn't mind waiting because we got time to look over the menu and look around at the decor. The restaurant has a really nice atmosphere - modern, yet rustic? The only thing that concerned me was that when you wait in line you stand at a shoulder-height counter overlooking the kitchen and there was no protective glass shield. I felt like a misplaced sneeze could've contaminated all the food being prepped on the line!  Our food came out in exactly 20 minutes. For having 8 orders in front of us, I thought that was good time. The portions were generous. I ordered the BMOC and had to take half of my pork chop home (...but I am a girl and I don't eat that much). The food was pretty awesome. The pork chop was tender, the apple sauce (kind of like apple pie filling) they drizzled on top was sweet but not TOO sweet. My only gripe was that they placed the porkchop on top of my waffle and covered the whole thing in apple sauce so my waffle wasn't as crispy as I would've liked. if I ordered it again I would ask for the waffle on the side, maybe on a separate plate.  My friend ordered the Banging Pocket, which he loved. I tried a bite and it was really good! What put it over the top was the salsa that came in a little side cup. I've had many salsas before but there was something really special about this stuff! Very flavorful, kind of tasted like they used roasted tomatoes or something because it had a very deep and rich flavor. He did not have any leftovers to take home.  With all of the interesting choices on the menu, we could come back here several times and not get bored. I also love that you can bring your dog on their outside patio :)  Edited to add that the service was very friendly. When we walked in they explained to us how it works (order food at counter, food served at your table) and everyone else was also helpful too."}
{"text":"Very good! I would definitely go back. They have a lot of different types of food for anyones taste buds. I had the Mexican Benedict and it was great. Spicy addition to the classic. Not a normal serve, you order and pay at the cashier and then they will bring your food. Interesting modern approach to brunch."}
{"text":"First time today and it was ok. Wasn't too busy. It's a little awkward because they have a different process for ordering and seating but theres a sign to explain that. Basically you place the order, get your drink and then wait to be seated. The menu wasn't impressive, I didn't think there was many options to choose from. Anyhow, ordered the Mexican Benedict. It wasn't very impressive or anything special. I wish they had sides to order because you really don't have options. Overall, I might try again but not anytime soon."}
{"text":"This restaurant is super cute inside. You have to order first up front before you sit. They have a good selection of breakfast items. I always order the Wilcox Avenue. I get it with over medium eggs, their spuds (which are super delicious!), the biscuit, and bacon."}
{"text":"The food here is completely overrated. Do NOT order the savory crepes, the chicken has a weird taste to it. The French toast was good, but again, nothing too special about it. The staff was very nice, but unfortunately the food is not worth the wait."}
{"text":"It's a pretty cool shop to come have breakfast, lunch and coffee. It's a bummer that they close so early though I would definitely like to come here later in the evenings or at night but the menu seems more fitted to the hours they have open. The atmosphere is chill though, you could bring a group of friends on relax."}
{"text":"This is a cute order and seat yourself type restaurant. I wanted a basic breakfast that included eggs, bacon and potatoes but my friends chose this place. I didn't see what I wanted on the menu but they made it for me anyway. So thank you! It was good. I forget what my 2 friends ordered but we all liked our food. Well one had a breakfast burrito but can't remember the other order."}
{"text":"ONE OF THE BEST BREAKFAST PLACES!  my girlfriend and I wanted to go somewhere new for breakfast and heard of Vovomeena. We are so happy that we discovered this place. Their waffles are amazing and also the shredded chicken burro things were outstanding!!!!!!!!!  EVERYONE NEEDS TO TRY THIS PLACE OUT!"}
{"text":"Came here for breakfast last Saturday morning. We ordered the Wilcox Ave and Pawtucket west.  The coffee is pretty good, we just had the regular coffee bit they've got quite a selection of brews. The food was great, well priced, and you get a lot of food for what you pay. I recommend getting the sausage, it tasted like it was cooked over an open flame and its taste reminded me of camping :)"}
{"text":"i was fairly unimpressed with the blackstone scramble. pretty tasteless and i didn't even want to finish it. i really liked my cappuccino, though, and the lil sugar cubes they have. i also wasn't a fan of the whole ordering setup where you have to line up to order, take a number, wait for your drinks if you ordered one and then get seated??? weird imo."}
{"text":"My fam bam and I had breakfast here this morning. The atmosphere and service was top notch. Their Orchard French Toast was delish! I definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Food was ok. I forgot the name of what I had but it had bread and some chipotle sauce in it. My husband just had some basic eggs with peppers and a tortilla. Went early on a Saturday morning and I just loved the vibe. Made me feel like they can pass for a place somewhere in Cali. For us it was a one time visit. We don't regret it though. It was nice"}
{"text":"Wow! So impressed.  Breakfast is one of the best I've ever had.  Good service, nice fresh environment and a big plate of delicious enjoyment.  Looking for a quality place with top quality food?  Stop here; I promise you won't regret it."}
{"text":"Vovomeena is the place we keep coming back to. The quality is always fantastic and the staff are friendly and helpful. It can seem a little hectic because you order first, then get your table, but it all really works out well. We've been at times when it's really busy and the quality doesn't suffer at all. If you've never been here for breakfast, I'd highly recommend giving Vovomeena a try."}
{"text":"Get the BMOC! Great breakfast spot with Portuguese influence, which is hard to find. The BMOC is just a big mess of all the best breakfast stuff...topped with a Portuguese donut. The best. My only knock on the place (which I admit is super picky) is they serve coffee in a paper cup. Coffee in a ceramic mug makes the meal just a bit nicer. Still one of my favorite brunch spots."}
{"text":"Really great customer service. Their food is great but just not a whole lot of selections. The place has a decent hip vibe and would love to come again. Their food prices is a bit pricey but worth the atmosphere, service and taste. Will come again but it's hard to choose with such limited options."}
{"text":"Hard to find at first but once we got there, I loved it. There's a parking lot in back of the restaurant but it gets jammed up quickly at lunchtime. They have seating inside and a patio connected to the restaurant and then a shared patio (Chipotle, salad place and a poke place in the same space) with extra seating.  I ordered the johnnycakes that came with crispy potatoes and a small side of sweet rice pudding along with a watermelon infused tea. The cakes were a mix of sweet/salty as they've got tiny pieces of corn and chile in them but strawberries on top and maple syrup to pour over if you'd like. I'm used to small, chunky cakes but these were HUGE! I couldn't even finish all of the food I received so a total bang for your buck!  The guys who run the space were great, super service focus and in an area with so many choices, I'd make this mine again and again!"}
{"text":"What a cool surprise.  I tried the Banger Wrap and thought the smoked gouda was the perfect touch. My husband went with the biscuits and gravy. Who knew you could get such a tasty breakfast for around $20.  This is well worth the trip if you are looking for something off the beaten path."}
{"text":"I swing through Phoenix every few months and I've made it a priority to stop by here for breakfast whenever I can. I've never had a bad meal here and at this point I've tried a bunch of different things -- the Pain Perdue, the Johnnycakes, the Biscuits and Gravy -- and it's all phenomenal, with unique and tasty cold brew options that you just can't get anywhere else, like orange peel and ginger or peanut butter cup. And  it's adorable and the people here are always so sweet -- this is a really special place that's 100% worth checking out if you're in the area."}
{"text":"Upon entering Vovomeena we knew that the five us stuck out like a sore thumb. Strangers in a new land searching for a delicious breakfast that will carry us through until lunch time.  I didn't catch the gentleman's name, but he knew we were outsiders. He told us about the restaurant. That we were allowed to sit anywhere, and that we should grab a menu and wait in line to order.  While waiting you can check out the cooks preparing others food. The sights and the smells were very inviting, and only made us that much more hungry. The entire menu looked good, so I decided to start the top with the Blackstone Scramble.  Of course you gotta order the bottomless cup of coffee too. I added Almond Milk to mine because I hadn't seen this option out in my native city Las Vegas. Everyone ordered food, and everyone's looked great.  Even better we were all quiet, and most importantly we all cleaned our plates.  We had a wonderful experience at Vovomeena and we will definitely return the next time we visit Phoenix.  I think I'll just keep checking things off the list, and go for whatever is second on the menu next time.  Oh, and if you want a really soothing experience.....go check out the bathroom. It's quite calming."}
{"text":"As a RI native I was very excited to find this menu online. This place is awesome!  It is definitely worth checking out for breakfast."}
{"text":"Great tasting cold brew but their espresso setup leaves a lot to be desired. Mexican Benedict had great flavor, not impressed with the sopes on this dish though. Decent breakfast but probably won't return."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a mid-morning breakfast and was absolutely delighted with my choice. I enjoyed the Johnnycakes (corn & chiles) with sweet rice and fried potatoes. The Johnnycakes were tender, crispy, and oh-so flavorful. The prickly pear maple syrup was smashing drenching the salty cakes. The sweet rice was like a breakfast rice & raisins dish and meshed perfectly with the savory cakes. The potatoes were crispy on the outside, cooked through within and flavored with crispy little onion slivers. The weather has become perfect for enjoying a meal outdoors - go for it!!"}
{"text":"Wow, I'm eating the BMOC right now and it is fantastic!   Who thought of this combo is a genius. A waffle with a big piece of something like smoked ham with Apple compote on top, two eggs on top of that, and local type of fried donut. Omg. I want to clean the plate..."}
{"text":"This place is certainly a hidden local gem! Amazing food and the coffee in and of itself is worth the stop. The Johnny cakes are a must along with the biscuits and gravy. So far, I haven't been here and tried anything I wouldn't recommend. Parking is scarce, so I would recommend car pooling if you're meeting people. It's the perfect little spot for weekend brunch with girlfriends, family, and kids."}
{"text":"The food was better this time so I'm happy I gave it another chance.  I had eggs, bacon and biscuit.  Skipped the spuds. Food was tasty.  Bacon has a nice flavor. The brewed coffee is hot with good flavor, oddly enough that is not always the case.  I marked it down to 3 for the poor customer relations on the part of the cashier and blaring music..  That man needs to learn not to look so grumpy.  He assumed I and my friend were on one tab and seemed to take offence when I corrected him and asked to pay only my bill.  Took him forever to fix it, looking grumpy the whole time.  It was unpleasant.  Please turn down the music!"}
{"text":"I came here last Saturday with my best friend for a post Junior League rummage sale breakfast and we were impressed.    The décor is cute, you feel almost like you are in someones home, even if the traffic flow and set up the restaurant is somewhat perplexing at first.  Soon enough we figured out where and how to order.    For other first timers, apparently you grab a menu at the end of the line that runs right in front of the open kitchen, you chose what you want while in line and then place your order and pay at the end of the line.  Not a bad set up as it allows you to see right into the cooking stations and watch the chefs in action (which is both neat and reassuring at the same time) but, when you get to the end of the line and pay that is where you are expected to also add your gratuity, and I just don't like the idea of having to pay gratuity on a meal before I've even been served or tasted the food.    Am I the only one that feels that way?  I think setting it up like that almost encourages patrons to hold back on the gratuity because we have to bet on the law of averages and assume that the service will be mid-grade so that we're not over tipping and if the service was great the server loses because lots of people don't carry cash.  I'm definitely not gonna swipe my debit card again simply to pay an additional gratuity.  Tipping at the end of the meal represents a better snapshot of how the diners experience really was.  Okay, getting off my soapbox now...  So, I ordered the Mexican Benedict and it was very good; spicy, savory and filling.  The poached egg was laid atop a perfectly flavorful bed of chorizo and smothered in delicious Hollandaise sauce.  Sadly I didn't detect any tomato or cilantro in mine.  Perhaps it was cooked into the chorizo and that's why I couldn't taste it?  That's okay though.  Honestly, the only aspect of the meal I didn't like was the dense, cold sopes that the eggs were perched atop of; they were hard, flavorless and cold.  While I understand wanting to keep with the Mexican theme, I still think that an English muffin (or anything else) would have been a better option here.  Or maybe just heat up the sopes first, so that they're hot and soft?  My best friend ordered the Pain Perdue with whiskey caramel sauce.  Oh, dear sweet, 6 lb, 7 oz. baby Jesus, it was SO GOOD.  It had the perfect texture and sponginess and spice.  You could really taste the bananas and the whiskey sauce was the perfect complement to the French toast; amazing.  It was served with two pieces of breakfast meat (she chose bacon) and the bacon was just so-so.  Not really brilliant or detracting, just your average piece of bacon.    She had a caramel latte and I had a plain cup of coffee, she loved her coffee and I thought mine was just okay.  Again just average coffee.  Decent, but not exotic in any way.  The service was very good and we were brought our food within just a few minutes of taking our number and having a seat.  About halfway through our meal we were checked on to make sure we were doing well, we were, and then we spent the rest of the meal enjoying the food and the décor and making silent comments about the eclectic assortment of guests around us.  (When you've been best friends for over 25 years, you learn to have whole conversations with just a look.)     So while I did mention a couple of things that I thought could be improved upon (the cold sopes and the advance gratuity being the most important issues) I still had a great visit, and it was a nice breakfast out for both of us.  We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Unbelievably delicious.  Amazing menu selection, out of this world coffee, best service ever. What a hidden gem. Sitting outside on the lovely patio today, sipping a latte, ejoying the spring breeze, waiting for Mexican eggs Benedict,  yum!  My 3rd time here, will keep comi back. Friends & fam I sent this way, twice, have also loved it. Can't recommend enough!"}
{"text":"I don't know if the Yelposphere knows this, but there are things called \"sopes\" or \"picaditas\" and they're basically thick ass tortillas and Vovomeena serves them as a base to their chorizo benedict and I am truly dead. I have died from deliciousness.   On another note, the manager has been there since inception and he was super great and attentive throughout our brekky. Go here!"}
{"text":"Met one of my girlfriends for brunch on a Wednesday. It wasn't busy at all but the service was lackluster.   Whenever I go to a new spot, especially one with such great reviews, I'm eager to talk to the staff about their favorite dishes and drinks. When I approached them with my typical excitement and list of menu questions, they showed minimal interest and had dull responses. I even asked for recommendations and the cashier wasn't very enthusiastic about any of the items really. A Portuguese donut sounded interesting so I asked how they were and I was told they are, \"just eh.\" Wow! I couldn't even believe it but I didn't order one because of it.   As a coffee addict I was pretty excited about the cold brew flight - but disappointed with all three flavors. They just weren't for me :( I'm not one to complain but I asked if I could just have a hot coffee instead. What was nice was one of the waitstaff refunded me the difference in price, even though I didn't ask to be. Even still, he just sort of awkwardly walked up to my table, handed me cash, mumbled that it was for the difference in price, and walked away. Not sure if I just caught the restaurant on an odd day or something but my entire service experience was just really was strange.   Both my friend's meal and my own tasted just okay. Nothing special about it. Pretty bummed because I was excited to find a new, cool brunch spot. On to the next one!"}
{"text":"Food was good, I do wish the menu was a little more descriptive.   Love the ambiance and the coffee bar, will give it another go at some point."}
{"text":"2nd time in today. I adore this place. The service is great and the food is wonderful. A bit more crowded then the last time but no worries. I stayed a while and was not rushed out. I will have to try something other than their to die for \"Pain Purdue\" though the next time I come in. The owner/manager, and other patrons it seems, suggest \"The Pocket.\" So next time it is a pocket for me.  Vovomeena has great sausages too. Some of the best I have had in AZ. In a city that thinks \"Matt's Big Breakfast and Denny's are Foodie Heavens ( Why?) I am happy to find Vovomeena. Drawback- it is pricey but I do not have to eat again all day after eating here. lol"}
{"text":"One word....Delicious!! The Pain Perdue was amazing..so light and fluffy for what looked like going to be a dense banana brownie covered in syrup...and the sausage had a little kick that evened out the sweetness. And the Morning Moonshine was great with a little almond milk.  My boyfriend had the Orchard French Toast which was also delicious and the biscuits and gravy smelled so good.     The place was also super cute. And the guys work behind the counter were really nice. I don't  go downtown much but if I am down there again around breakfast definitely going to be a stop. Great job guys"}
{"text":"Our Friend posted on Facebook about Vovomeena and RAVED about the Pain Perdu. Naturally, we had to check it out. The Pain perdu is Banana bread pudding French toast, whiskey caramel, and a choice of meat or spuds. Like the G that I am, I had the turkey sausage and the spuds (so damn good)! The sausage was OK, but the spuds were cooked to perfection, and let me tell you about that banana bread pudding French toast... \"So, good you'd slap yo Momma\" - Pops! Much like the Terminator, \"We'll be back!\" to terminate some other yummy selections from their simple, but yummy menu selection.  Until Next Time...  Maine  PS The ICED COFFEE isn't to be played with, I was full of energy for the rest of the day! The OJ is really good, taste so fresh, and so squeezed!"}
{"text":"Good but I don't like how you can't edit the menu to your own liking. I would have liked to order a side of eggs or like a short stack on the side."}
{"text":"I wasn't fond of this place and I probably won't return. The pics look good but the food was just ok. The coffee was overpriced, if I wanted to pay $5 for an iced coffee id go to Starbucks. We ordered the Mexicans Benedict, which sounded good but wasn't great. The chorizo was just ok and the sopa wasn't as tasty as I'd had hoped. I wish there was more hollaindaise sauce. I couldn't even taste it. The eggs were cooked well, which is a plus. Also, there were ANTS crawling all over our table - yes, we sat inside. We found at least 5 ants through out our meal. Dirty dirty"}
