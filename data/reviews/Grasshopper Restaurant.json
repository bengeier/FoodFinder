{"text":"I love this place really tasty vegan fare. I love it even though I'm not really vegan. They fry their fries in sesame oil. yum. Today I tried the portabello mushroom burger. very good. I've had the tempeh burger too. excellent."}
{"text":"The staffs were friendly, we were greeted immediately. The shop is very small and tight.

I think it's a bit pricey for the portion and quality of food. Decent place, good for a quick healthy bite if you don't mind splurging a bit."}
{"text":"Nice cute little Vegan Restaurant.  I wish there were more Vegan Restaurants like this one.  The food was full of flavor!

I very much recommend the \"pulled pork\" sandwich and chilli fries.  I swear I was eating meat, the texture was spot on.  

Can't wait to go back"}
{"text":"This is my first review ever..I logged in just to write this because the food was so tasty! My friend and I had dinner here and were pleasantly surprised. I had the mac and cheese with kale chips and my friend had the chili. The mac and cheese is made with Daiya, for anyone already familiar with the best soy/nut free cheese out there. Not too creamy and the noodles were cooked just right, which can be hard to do with the gluten free ones. I would definitely return to try some of the other things on the menu. Or maybe I'll just have the mac and cheese again. Only downfall was that they didn't have any gluten free beers on the menu. But we heard from the server that this was in the works, as well as additional items on the menu. Overall, really a nice new addition to the vegan/ gluten free restos in Toronto, and reasonable prices also."}
{"text":"It was wonderful. Best sandwich ever. If you are vegan and want some fast food this is the place. Cheap and good."}
{"text":"As a vegan, I was pretty excited to try out the new location in the Junction. The decor was really nice and the waiters were very friendly, but unfortunately those were the only good things about it.

We got the chickun and waffles and the chia seed parfait. The waffle had basil in it for some reason. It wasn't terrible, but it wasn't good. It wasn't exactly brunch food, and I wasn't exactly in the mood for a \"dinner waffle\". The chia seed parfait was utterly inedible. It was a slimy, tasteless mush accompanied by unripe bananas. It was more than just unpleasant to eat -- it actually made me feel sad and embarrassed for the chef.

Even the coffee was disappointing! It was nice to be able to choose between soy and almond milk (though even Starbucks has coconut milk!), but it was so sour, it made Tim Hortons look like a luxury by comparison.

Once again, Toronto's vegan restaurant scene disappoints. And as long as restaurant goers in this city remain so sheepish, we're all going to keep paying for pretty restaurants full of terrible food. Well, not me."}
{"text":"Nice that it's vegan, but everything on the menu is oil-filled fast food (except for one salad not balanced enough to be a meal) on the menu, small portions (unless you get a sandwich) and a bit pricey.

The atmosphere was a little awkward to sit in if there is no one else eating there, since the everyone working there just kind of stands near the cash a few feet away from you and waits (it's a very small place). 

The desserts are from Sweet of the Earth but much more overpriced than other restaurants (ex cake is 4$, but same size as the 2$ ones you can buy in supermarkets/rexalls).  

Anyways, did not enjoy it much and it cost the same as some nicer vegan places in Kensington....."}
{"text":"This is my first review so here it goes...

Friends had told us about the chick-un burger at this restaurant so we had to try it. Wow is all I can say. It was delicious. My meat eating husband couldn't believe how good it was. 

We were extremely impressed with this restaurant. Our server Dana was so sweet and attentive. She made wonderful suggestions which we took and thoroughly enjoyed. 

We started with the rice balls as an appetizer.... oh man they were good. We both had the chick-un burger with sesame fries then had to order another order of the rice balls because they were that good. I don't remember what sauce came with them but it was the perfect pairing.

The portions are perfect and they give you just enough. They don't overload your plate which I like. Less waste.

They have a nice selection of fresh juices and smoothies. We had the pear ginger and a green smoothie which were both suggested by the waitress and both very good. 
We also had the cheesecake and a cashew cookie which were amazing!

We will definitely be back again and highly recommend this restaurant to everyone. It's a nice little place with a great atmosphere, friendly waitstaff and wonderful food."}
{"text":"It is a ver small vintage restaurant similar to sadie's dinner.  Their chefs are asian so that they have asian fusion dishes.  I came here for veggielicious because I was attracted by the food photos.  $25 for 3 courses plus smooth sounds good deal to me.   Having a Green smoothie as start off for the dinner was good.  The appetizer, entree and dessert were small.  But I could not stop eating.   I would highly recommend their veggielicious.   Good portion for one person and non big eater"}
{"text":"This would be a good experience if I didn't end up in a washroom for the rest of the day with the upset stomach. Clearly it was something wrong with the drink or main dish (mushrooms bowl). Stay away."}
{"text":"This place is tiny, but the food is amazing. We called ahead and asked for a reservation and they said they didn't take them. We showed up there and there were two ''reserved'' tables that walked in after us and were sat before us. Not cool! I might have given them 5 starts otherwise."}
{"text":"Grasshopper is brilliant.  Quite a small and cosy restaurant but pumping out awesome flavours.  The pulled pork banh mi is very sweet and not at all spicy as the menu suggests,  the chicken banh mi is awesome. Now following a vegetarian diet,  I have tried many chicken sandwiches in the past and I have to say the chicken banh mi easily one of the best! The beef n mushroom satay sticks are great,  very 'meaty' texture which comes with a fresh garlicky dip. The mac and cheese is also great,  quite heavy on the garlic too.  Visited the place a few times over a week in Toronto,  would heartily recommend"}
{"text":"Tiny restaurant. Fun food. 

Only real issue is that there's not a lot of seating at all, so it can be very inflexible if you're bringing a group."}
{"text":"Pretty good, service was a little awkward but the restaurant is cute, nice vibe. 
Kale salad was really delicious, there's a particularly good dressing but I can't remember what it was called. I enjoyed my meal well enough, though I was surprised that the portion size was small. I liked it here."}
{"text":"This was our plan B restaurant but it actually should have been plan A. I ordered the pulled pork bahn mi  with seseam fries and a lychee soda and my husband ordered the beef bahn mi with kale chips   and a beer. We were pleased but we ended up like each other's sandwich better.  I preferred the beef sandwich to the pork because i felt the flavour was balanced and the pork just felt chewy an sweet...to each it's own.  The kale chips were delicious but greasy and the seseam fries are brilliant but to much salt.  This restaurant is small and doesn't seem kid friendly if you want to bring a small child but I'm just going off what a saw with out asking if they have a high chair.  Also our server was was delightful, she left us to enjoy our food...I hate  when every two seconds someone is coming over to see if we like our food,once in the middle and at the end is the best in my experience. We will be back and highly recommend this restaurant!!"}
{"text":"Tasty, healthy and doesn't leave you feeling bloated. The menu is small and concise which is good. Comparable to other LA vegan places."}
{"text":"I got the chili and rice and it was the most delicious thing I have ever had from a Vegan restaurant! The staff was very friendly and courteous and the food was hot, cooked well and very tasty. Will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch for the first time on a Friday in March at about 12:40 while at work looking  for some good veg take-out. After entering the smaller space it seemed pretty busy with ppl with only one server who seemed pretty stressed and frantically busy which may be why he interacted in a somewhat clipped manner but was fairly courteous overall despite all this (no service with a smile though :(..I was hoping for some nice healthy soup and asked if they had soup of the day to which the server responded no. So I ordered a spring salad to go as the description seemed interesting.   After paying $11 plus tax for the salad, I was somewhat disappointed to see that it was a small serving size and salad itself seemed quite simplistic. I was also confused as to why I got two fairly large cups of dressing for such a small amount of salad. It tasted decent, simple flavours which worked well together. The greens looked a bit old an droopy and consisted of only arugala or something similar (def not mixed greens that I've become accustomed to consuming in most of my salads these days) Overall I was less than impressed and expected more from an $11 salad. I won't be returning to grasshopper after my lacklustre and seemingly overpriced experience here."}
{"text":"I'm not a vegetarian so I might not be the best person to review Grasshopper but I did enjoy my lunch- I had the \"chicken\" nuggets and \"pulled pork\" banh mi sandwich- both of which were pretty good.  I wouldn't want to eat here too often for the obvious reasons but for vegetarians I'm sure it's a nice spot.  This place is small, but has cute decor and good service."}
{"text":"My sister ordered a Portobello burger the first time she went there, and ever since, it's pretty much the same thing she eats everytime she goes there. So that's a must-try for sure I guess? Other than that, we went there for her birthday and she ordered a Kale Salad besides her regular lol. As for me i ordered the rice and mushrooms dish, I don't remember the specifics of what was inside my bowl, but it tasted AMAZING, like the best food I had had in weeks. My sister was full by the time she had finished her burger, so it was up to me to finish that dreadly looking and uninviting kale salad. At first i did not even want to touch it, because, you know, kale salad. lol. But then I decided to give it a shot. The first bit i ate was without the sauce and it was not as bad as I expected. But THEN, i added the sauce, and it was MAGIC, like the salad went 0 to a 100. It was delicious, like as good as the rice and mushrooms dish. For dessert i wanted to have the gluten free cheesecake but they were out, so we both ordered cashew cookies. They tasted a little too sweet to me, but i`d give them a 4.5 out of 5 if they were a little less sweet, otherwise just a 4 due to being overly sweet. Overall though, it`s a really inspiring place for vegan food, because of the negative image that people usually associate with vegan food in general. This restaurant definitely defies the popular belief about vegan food, and you should definitely give it a try people!"}
{"text":"Good service delicious food. I had mushrooms with rice and really enjoyed it. The waitress is very hospitable."}
{"text":"Grasshopper is one of my favourite restaurants in Toronto. The \"Pork\" Bahn Mi and \"Chicken\" Bahn Mi are fantastic - the 'pulled pork' they make is the best veggie version I've ever had - and the sesame fries are delicious. Great portions and very reasonable price. 

And $5 cocktail happy hour!!!"}
{"text":"Food is tasty and the servers are always nice but it is painfully slow. The only ever have one poor server during busy brunch rushes and that one server has to make all the smoothies too. Expect to wait 30+ minutes for your order to be taken and even then probably longer because by the time they finally are able to take your order they'll be out of what you wanted. I don't mind waiting for good food but waiting to take an order is ridiculous. If they hired a second sever they'd be able to flip tables faster and no one would lose their mind from the hangry."}
{"text":"Pathetic, you'll lose some brain cells just interacting with the waitress and staff here.

The service was shoddy, and the server was confused. I had written a scathing review as soon as I came home from the restaurant, but deleted it this morning in goodwill, after speaking to the manager who apologized. Nonetheless, I thought it was only fair to my fellow Yelpians to post an upgraded second review. 

To summarize my experience at Grasshopper: I ordered a chick-un sandwich with an extra addition of sautéed mushrooms, yet my food arrived without the latter. Upon inquiry, I was finally given a fridge cold bowl of mushrooms on the side. When I persisted again, I was told that, the chef thought mushrooms weren't supposed to be eaten with sandwiches (yet lo and behold they were on the menu) and that the reason I got cold ones was cause he thought it would take \"too long to sauté the mushrooms\" and \"serve me fresh food\".
Still in disbelief, when I tried to clarify the nonsensical illogical explanation once again, she assured me \"she was on my side\", whatever that meant. She threw the same logic back into my face, about how she'd forgotten to put my request on the system so the chef didn't see it, and that the chef didn't think that mushrooms were supposed to be on the menu along with sandwiches anyway. Moreover, the chef, as the waitress put it, didn't have the time to \"sauté me fresh mushrooms\", cause \"it would take too long\". Clearly, this chef has plenty of other things to do with his time then get the customer's order correct. The waitress too got rude, curt and impatient at this point, as thought it was somehow abnormal that I wasn't getting her illogical reasoning. 

I was unsure who to contact at first regarding this since I read somewhere that the owner here also works as the chef (?). It didn't make sense to call the restaurant up and argue with the chef/owner about why he was being lazy. I thought it was best to talk to the same server itself.Luckily I was put through to the manager who was pretty nice and apologized for the fiasco. He explained things for me, and was in disbelief at some of the stuff the waitress said. He said they need to alter the menu since in fact the sandwiches are not supposed to have any additions. Even so, his explanation for why they couldn't just accommodate my request, or why the mushrooms were cold, was unconvincing. I mean, why didn't the waitress just say the menu was wrong directly, or just heat the freakin mushrooms ?! Its not like I asked for a fresh batch of mushrooms.

In any case there was a pretty big difference in his account of the story and the server's account. And some pretty big loop holes. So either someone's lying, or everybody's confused like me.I don't even know what actually happened now with the contradictory stories, but one thing's for certain, there's a huge gap in communication between the staff at Grasshopper. Their servicing skills need some polishing posthaste. They lack professionalism as well, since something as simple as a forgotten addition was raked up into such a huge debacle, instead of being solved smoothly. 
Surely, in the three weeks that they've opened, I can't be the only one who ordered additions with my sandwich? (I mean, its on the menu!) I wonder what they did to the rest of the poor suckers who dared ask for additions. Were they too chastised for not understanding the woes of the busy chef?

The food itself is alright, not too bad actually! Price is pretty worth it, and the ambience quite nice. The service ruins everything though -_-"}
{"text":"this is my first ever review and ive had the yelp app for months so you can already tell how good this place was!! 

we started off with the kale chips.. which were amazing!! theyre thin, deep-fried pieces of kale. the first bite has an average taste until the aftertaste kicks in which is full of flavour!! 

following i had the chick-un nuggets which were the BEST nuggets ive ever had, they mock chicken taste better than real chicken! I had the chipotle BBQ sauce on the side which added a unique flavour to the nuggets.. a little more on the spicy side but they were incredibly delectable! 

my boyfriend and I got our main courses which were the mac and cheese and the banh-mi pulled pork sandwich.. the mac and cheese was super good.. usually im not a fan of vegan cheese because of its richness but it was balanced perfectly! the banh-mi pulled pork sandwich was FULL of flavour and had a unique taste of sweet and salty!! 

for desert we had the blueberry cheesecake and it was one of the best cheesecakes ive ever had.. it was super soft and creamy and rich!! 

will DEFINITELY be coming back again, MUST be adding on top of this review im not even vegan and found this food delightful, everything was arranged beautifully, service was nice and friendly and most importantly fast.. it closed at 10 but didnt try and rush us out!! Must-try place!!"}
{"text":"There is a lot of potential here. 

The decor inside is very cute-rustic but classy. It's a very small place run by a single waitress at a time. They have what seems to be awesome happy hour specials and $5 for 2 PBR specials on Friday and Saturday. 

I was excited to try this place out. I went around 6.15 with a friend of mine, and we were starving. The waitress was very attentive and friendly. She knew the menu well and was able to make recommendations and answer our questions. She suggested the sweet ginger tea, which was awesome. 

But then 7pm rolled around, we still didn't have our food. She came over to apologize, but didn't offer any sort of discount or compensation. Around 7.15 another group came in and sat down, and she took their order. At 7.30, we still didn't have our food and we were starving. By the time the food got here (7.37) my order was wrong. I was given salad instead of fries! Which isn't a big deal, but it was kind of annoying. 

The food was good but I don't know if it was worth the wait. For the record, the group who came in at 7.15 got their meals around the same time as we did, so maybe it was just a fluke. But I probably won't come back here for a while, unless I'm not very hungry."}
{"text":"Good job grasshopper!!!  I love my \"pulled pork\" sandwich with sesame fries.. Customer service was the best part too!"}
{"text":"Possibly my favorite vegan eats in the city! I discovered this place about 2 months ago and have been like 8 times. It is always good. 

Chicken banh mi, pulled pork banh mi, beef skewer things, mac n cheese, chicken nuggets, kale salad...all of it s so good. Plus they always have great drink specials.

I just wish I could have my fries not be sesame. 

I LOVE YOU GRASSHOPPER."}
{"text":"The food was average but the wait was terrible....it took more than 40 mins for my food to come. Also it's expensive and they have pretty small serving sizes.
Don't think I'll go there again"}
{"text":"Love this place!!! sooo goood... i always start with the \"chicken nuggets\" but always get the spicy poppers sauce (such a great hot sauce). then i finish off with one of the sandwiches. I change it up each time I go. usually \"pulled pork\" or \"beef\", once in a while the \"chicken\" which goes well with a side kale coleslaw. I'm drooling all over my keyboard as i type this just remembering...."}
{"text":"The environment is really nice. The person who helped us was very friendly and helpful, she makes it a point to keep the environment personal and friendly. The food is nice, average priced and creative and the juices are really yummy!"}
{"text":"I could say I'm a regular here and I've never had anything except excellent service and excellent food. I'm honestly shocked this place only has 3 1/2 stars and starting to loose faith in Yelp reviews. 

The servers are always super nice and the food is tasty and never takes too long. 

Highly recommend the chick'un wrap, rice poppers (that sauce is beyond 5 stars) Japanese curry bowl (oh my god good) and if you don't have room ask for the tiramisu to go (it's the best vegan desert I've had, seriously, get it). 

Come here. You can thank me later."}
{"text":"It's NOT a hole in the wall and not really anything special. 

The alternative meat options are, for the most part, soy-based (which in that case, I'll just buy and make at home).
I got the chili with a chorizo bun for 7 dollars. The bun was about 5cmx5cm and extremely touch. The bowl of soup was very small and nothing special (just tomato sauce, corn, and beans).  To be honest, for something so basic, I expected cheaper prices.
Shared the mac and cheese with a friend. The \"side of kale chips\" is arguably the size of 1 piece of kale. The portion was that small. 
Customer service was great, but kind of expected since the restaurant could barely hold 30 people at a time."}
{"text":"The late comedian John Pinette used to say \"Salad isn't food. Salad comes with the food!\" That pretty much says everything about my relationship with any kind of food that wasn't meat. (While I was growing up, anyway.) But, in embracing the Yelp spirit, I decided I would try something new and exciting and definitely out of my comfort zone. And so: Grasshopper. 

I dropped in with a friend on a late afternoon/early evening, and we were the only ones there. Another couple would come in after, but for the most part the traffic coming and going was for take out. 

I took the advice of some past reviews and ordered the spicy rice balls and vegan mac & cheese. Both dishes were absolute winners, 10/10. The rice balls were crispy and spicy, as advertised. Definitely a unique and yummy app! The mac & cheese was awesome as well! Tasted like there was nothing vegan about it. They were served with some kale chips, which I didn't really care for. The seasoning on them was too spicy/salty for me. 

If I'm ever in the area again, I'd definitely like to try out some other things on the menu."}
{"text":"Delicious Banh mi and they serve a fresh kale salad on the side. I love the dressing on the side and the service was spot on. Friendly and prompt with asking whether anything else was needed. The music was also pleasant. We sometimes have a hard time sitting through the meal when the music is too trendy and horrible. We will be coming back."}
{"text":"I was so dissatisfied with this restaurant I've actually created a yelp account to review it. 
Craving a salad, I yelped the area and found this Vegan spot. The reviews were mediocre but they had wifi, I was working remotely and figured I'd give it a shot. Upon looking at the menu I realised that I should probably go somewhere else . Prices for salads were higher than average and had no more than a handful of ingredients of them.. few of these ingredients being substantial/filling. 
I was on a phone call with a friend when the waitress came to take my order, I told her that I was about to leave and that I was looking for a more \"substantial salad\". She directed my attention to their special. \"The Sweet Potato\" named, endearingly after the local organic grocery shop with whom they've partnered to make the dish. Surprisingly no sweet potato in the dish. It seemed to be a denser option as it had some tofu and mushrooms. The advertisement for the special had no price but I assumed that it would be the same as their other salads... 

When it came out, I was unmoved. It was more or less the \"grocery greens\" salad I was trying to avoid. I asked for side hummus to help fill out the meal. They had no hummus but the waitress brought me a side of (what I assume are) canned beans. 
The dressing was fine, the salad came in a big bowl, they did not skimp on the greens. The meal wasn't bad.. resoundingly mediocre. 

When the bill came out I realised how much this incredibly average salad was. $17!! AND they charged me for the canned beans $2.50. So with tax.. my bill came out to $22.. by the time I tipped the waitress (who was good at her job) I had paid...
 $26 !!! for... just one bowl of mixed greens, carrots, tofu, mushrooms, dressing and canned beans. 

Insane that they feel okay charging this much. I feel like I've been robbed. I will never go back."}
{"text":"I've only been to Grasshopper once, and I remember liking the food and service. My bf (who grew up eating meat) loved it because their pulled pork was so close to real pork. Would recommend if you are taking meat eaters with you - they will be sure to find something they like."}
{"text":"I have been here a few times.  The first time was just after the restaurant opened and the food and service was good.  The second time I ordered the mac and cheese to go and it was an awful, congealed mess by the time I got it home.

Today, my partner and I went in for lunch.  There were a few tables but they already had been served their orders by the looks of it.  We ordered two sandwiches and some kale chips and then waited about 40 minutes for our food to come.  By this time we were the only ones left in the restaurant.  Even our drinks took about 10 minutes to arrive.  

We finally received our sandwiches but no kale chips.  Just as we were finishing up our food (at least an hour after ordering) and with no sign of the chips, I let our very sweet  server know that we would not still be wanting them as we had planned to have them as the starter.  I said I figured that someone forgot we ordered them.  Her reply was just to offer them to go.  

The food is good, but for us, it took too long.  The kitchen staff is certainly in no hurry however they should understand that many people are there during their lunch hour and don't have two hours to kill for a sandwich and chips."}
{"text":"This place is great, fresh food, good service, and a laid back casual ambiance. 
The servers are all super nice and knowledgeable and cater to dietary restrictions. 
Last time I went here they had a seasonal dish with in collaboration with the local grocery store and it was wonderful! All locally sourced ingredients and great flavour, it was called the sweet potato bowl. 

Only reason this place isn't getting 5 stars is because it seems like their menu needs an update, they use vital wheat gluten in a lot of their burgers and sandwiches, which is straight up not healthy, the pancakes my friend got were sooooo sugary and the chili bowl was a bit bland. But everytime I've ordered here I like what I taste! The Haru salad is awesome and so is the breakfast bowl!

Definitely, would recommend if you're in the area."}
{"text":"I am not a vegetarian restaurant and I really liked this place. The \"meat\" was better than passable - it was delicious. But let start from the start.

This is a small place so I called to make a reservation. The staff were great, setting out a little \"reserved\" sign for the table with water and cutlery ready to go. It's a little thing that brought a smile to my face.

My friends and I ordered a chick-un nugget appetizer, which came with a choice of bbq or peanut sauce. We took the peanut sauce which tasted similar to peanut flavoured fresh roll sauce if you are familiar. The chick-un was great. Not like real chicken but nevertheless tasty with a strong meaty texture. 

For mains I had the \"pulled pork\" bahn mi and jake salad. First thing to know is that in this case the pulled pork actually tasted like pulled pork! Now this may be a function of the nature and flavour of pulled pork being inconsistent across different restaurants, but still, impressive. It was not the most delicious sandwich in the city and I don't want to give a \"well it gets points for trying\" type of review because that wouldn't do the owners and chefs credits; rather I will simply say that it is on par with many of the other pulled pork sandwiches I've had in Toronto. The kale salad was a bit like kale coleslaw with dressing on the side. Pretty tasty too. I tried some of my friends sesame fries (fries cooked in sesame oil) and may have to get those next time - just terrific.

Overall this was a really pleasant eating experience for any kind of restaurant. As a non vegetarian I would go back. If you are a vegetarian I seriously re conned you try it."}
{"text":"i love the food here, and the place is really cute too :) ive tried their pulled pork, chicken sandwich and the burger and i looooveeeee all 3 and cant wait to go back and try more. everything on the menu looks sooooo good and the sesame fries are now my favourite fries ive ever had. they're really tasty and crunchy. best vegan food i've had so far in toronto!!!!! cant wait to come back to try more"}
{"text":"This place was quite good! I had the vegan pulled pork sandwich with the kale salad. Both where excellent! Lots of flavour in the sandwich and the bread was delicious. Also- the dressing on the salad was vegan and sooo tasty!! Creamy and flavourful. Can't wait to try more items on the menu!"}
{"text":"The food is excellent but the atmosphere was noisy.  I could barely hear the people I was with.  So it is not a place for a quiet dinner.  More like a busy pub environment.  The vegan food is mostly imitating meat dinners, but did it well."}
{"text":"The pulled pork bahn mi I had was AMAZING. It was filling, incredibly delicious, and I would go out of my way to come here again. In my personal opinion, it was as good as vegetarian meat can get. We also ordered the \"beef\" and mushroom sautés, which I would honestly skip the next time I go. It wasn't bad by any means, I just wouldn't personally order it again. Also, my boyfriend was a big fan of the Chimichurri sauce. The service was also great, I was really happy with my experience here! I would recommend omnivores and vegans alike to dine here!"}
{"text":"Basically it's vegan Ban Mia shop with a few other things as well. It was great, bread was fresh and the mock meats are of tasty setian, Get the kale salad as the side dish, it's also very nice."}
{"text":"I ordered a Haru (\"Spring\") salad at the Grasshopper, and was told that the size would be quite big and filling, however I was not impressed. It was interesting to try a salad with gobo root (I had never tried that before, and liked it's flavour), however, everything else within the salad, except for the mixed green, seemed to be rather lacking. I tried the salad with the recommended bold plum dressing, which paired nicely with it, but it was rather acidic, and tasted a bit like a vinegary commercial plum sauce. Overall, given the price of the salad and it's size, I was not impressed or delighted by its $9 price tag. 

In contrast however, my boyfriend got the $12 Burger Platter (Tempeh Sloppy Joe), which was really nice, and despite being made of Tempeh, reminded me of an original Sloppy Joe. The next time I go the Grasshopper, I think I will likely get the Tempeh Sloppy Joe, or another one of their sandwiches, instead of a salad. In addition, the sesame fries at the Grasshopper are really delicious and crispy, and they are sliced very thin. 

The service at the Grasshopper is great, and the waitress managing the store at the time was very friendly and accommodating; the ambience in the restaurant throughout our meal was very pleasant. 

If the Grasshopper was a bit cheaper overall, I think I might give it a higher rating. Overall however, this is a good place to check out if you are a vegan in the city - but I would recommend sticking to the sandwiches instead of the salads."}
{"text":"I ordered the spring salad and was quite impressed with the plum dressing it added quite the quick to the salad with a big of tang as well. I usually lean more towards salads when eating out but grasshopper has quite a selection of imitation meats, that look very good. a small menu but they deliver on what they cook. had a very university feel on the interior."}
{"text":"The service was nice and helpful. 
Pear Ginger juice is delightful and has a well-balanced flavour.
I have never considered a full vegan diet until I tried their Chick-un sandwiches. 
Salad dressing was quite unique."}
{"text":"I came here with a friend on a Saturday, noon-ish. We didn't have to wait long to be seated which was nice. Small, cute space.

We were disappointed by the food though. We ordered the rice poppers, chicken banh mi, mac n cheese and sesame fries and shared the dishes. It was a filling meal but nothing stood out to either of us."}
{"text":"GREAT BURGERS  ! I had the chick-un burger with tomato and corn soup and it was the best veggie chicken burger I've ever had.  The soup was alright, it literally just tasted like tomato and corn lol. Server was nice, place is small and cozy, food was fast."}
{"text":"On our first visit, we had the battered portobello mushroom (Wahn) burger with melted cheese, pickles and a spicy mayo on a hamburger bun and sesame fries. Burger was very good. Fries were a little salty but still good - crispy with good sesame flavour. 

On our second visit, we had the beef banh-mi and sesame fries. The \"beef\" had a nice texture and the flavour was also nice, a bit gingery and a bit sweet. The spicy mayo (ordered as an extra) is what made the dish. 

Stars are for the food only. Service is inconsistent."}
{"text":"I entered the restaurant at 12 PM and it only had one customer. I sat down at a table of my choice and the waiter placed a menu on my table. The restaurant is narrow and has about 6 tables. The big window lit the room. The booth was wooden while the chairs had a cushion. The waiter placed a dirty pitcher of water and a clean glass. It was odd. I'm not sure what made the pitcher dirty. It looked like soap stains? 

I ordered the tempeh sloppy joes with a side of sesame fries. The meal was huge. I was definitely full. But was it an amazing meal? Not really. My sloppy joe was sloppy but the texture was too soft for my liking. I wish the bread was crustier or toasted. The buns felt like they were just taken out of a bag from the grocery store. The tempeh itself was well seasoned and delicious. It was slow cooked in tomato and other spices. The sesame fries were the best part of my lunch. They were crispy and had a slight taste of sesame. They were a bit too oily but they were so delicious.

I took a cashew cookie for the road. I highly recommend it for those who love cashews. It tastes like you're eating a handful of cashews but in a cookie form that melts in your mouth. The service was fine. The waiter was kind. My meal cost a total of $20 but this gave me a meal and a snack for the road."}
{"text":"One of my new favourites. Tried a couple different dishes. The mushroom burger is AMAZING and so was the pulled pork sandwich. The fries were also great!!! I can't wait to come back and try out more dishes. Everything was also reasonably price!! So happy I stumbled across Grasshopper!!!!"}
{"text":"Delicious burgers and sandwiches!
I would say grasshopper is perfect for those who just converted to be a vegetarian but still miss meat or who are not eating meat for ethical reason. They did such a good job on imitation meat. The chewy texture is very satisfying. I tried the nuggets, beef banh mi, pulled pork sandwich and the mushroom burger. Each one of them were mind blowingly good, perfectly seasoned, even better than some of the meat burgers. The only flaw was the lack of actual vegetable dishes. I mean vegetable, soy and seitan, mushrooms made into imitation meat were great, but I'd like to eat some vegetables as vegetables, not processed into fake meat. 

Food were great, sub par service, I will definitely come back to try the rest of the menu. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"wonderful staff and delicious food. the poppers and the portobello mushroom burger are a must try. service was quick, food was hot, and the atmosphere was very calm/casual. prices are reasonable for the portion size, the mushroom burger fed two of us. I would recommend this place for vegans, vegetarians, and meat eaters alike."}
{"text":"Food is amazing, tastes great. Great meat substitutes that actually taste like the real thing, they are a bit over prices for what types of things they are selling on the menu, but in the end it's all about taste, and this restaurant definitely has it. If you order from just eat.com or orderit.ca for home delivery they charge you a high fee of 6.95, you if you want to save just go pick it up."}
{"text":"Great vegetarian restaurant!  You don't need to be a vegetarian to enjoy this place, great food and quality.  There is no compromise on taste here, the focus here is to make vegetables taste amazing for what they are, not trying to make anything taste like meat."}
{"text":"All in all not happy with the quality of the food.

I took my friends (omnivores) on a double date with my husband and I. They all had the unchicken burger and I got the pulled pork sandwich with kimchi fries.

I seriously think I was mildly food poisoned by this sandwich, since I was the only one feeling sick after eating. (Not to mention it came out room temperature... So I don't think they are watching the temperature of the food storage)

Also, I paid an extra 3$ to have about a teaspoon worth of kimchi on my fries. Not happy with their idea of an \"upgrade\". 

For once I tried another vegan restaurant other than @thehogtownvegan, and I regret it. I won't be back to visit the grasshopper."}
{"text":"As a vegan new to Toronto, I have generated a rather large list of cafes and restaurants to check out. So far, Grasshopper has been a clear standout.

My boyfriend and I stopped by tonight (he is non-vegan) and we both thoroughly enjoyed our meals. I had the pulled pork banh mi and he had the black bean burger, we also shared the rice puffs for a starter. 

The rice puffs were cooked to perfection, and the house hot sauce was fantastic. The mains were also great, and the addition of the sesame oil to the fries was a real winner. 

We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"On a business trip to Toronto, and a colleague recommended this spot. I'm not a vegetarian, but also not a huge meat eater, so I was excited to give this place a try. I had no idea what to expect, and went with the \"Beef\" banh mi and pomegranate mint lemonade. Two words: SO GOOD. Even if you're not a vegetarian, this is some delicious stuff. Lots of flavour and spices in the sandwich, and the lemonade is perfection. A casual spot, friendly staff, and good location."}
{"text":"Food 3.5/5 (50% of final grade)
Disclaimer: This is the first western-style vegan restaurant I've been to, so my review would be based on the tastes of both vegan and non-vegan food in general, and not limited to vegan food. 
My palate was surprisingly refreshed, and the tastes were mingling in a very refined type of way.  I went with two other girlfriends, and they ate like birds. I finished most of their food, so I ate approximately the amount of two three course meals. The focus though isn't on my hearty appetite, but how I didn't feel bloated or as if I had a stone in my stomach after the meal--unlike with usual, non-vegan meals. All together we ordered the Kale Chips, Satay \"Beef\" Skewers (VERY convincing), \"Chicken\" Nuggets, Pork Banh-mi (not as convincing as the beef but still very yum; a viet-style sub), Sesame Fries (couldn't even taste the sesame, but ok), Burger Platter (with the black bean patty), Kale salad with Gobo bits, Blueberry Cheesecake, Almond Cookie, Chocolate Zucchini Loaf, and a brownie. My girlfriends bought home desserts even after our extra-filling meal--that's how nice it was for them. My favourite was the kale salad. I recommend trying the beef banh-mi--their mock-beef is on point. 

Ambience 2.5/5 (15% of final grade)
Though it was a bit squished, it was acceptable. Nothing about the interior decorating was positively or negatively note-worthy though. They did dim the lights in an attempt to make it more ambient, but it wasn't entirely successful. Luckily, they made up for it for the taste in food.

Service 3.5/5 (15% of final grade)
Our lady server was very friendly, and although she mentioned that she was new to the job, she was very patient and helpful in helping the hopeless me decide on menu items. She did mess up on our orders slightly, but to our benefit, because she ended up giving us an extra side of kale salad and sesame fries ;) She quickly corrected what was missing though, and all was fine and dandy. Our glasses were always filled with water, and she made obvious efforts to understand how we were liking the food. One thing I do wonder though... All the staff were ladies in black spaghetti strap tops (we went in the summer)... Why? Oh well, it doesn't matter, 'cause I got good food :)

Cost 3/5 (10% of final grade)
For the quality and amount of food we ordered, it was actually a really nice price! Especially taking into account that it IS downtown, and usually vegan restaurants are really presumptuous with their pricing. 

Brownie Points 3/5 (10% of final grade)
When we got there without reservations, there wasn't a table free for three (try saying that three times fast), but a neighbourhood-friendly PDA-ing couple was nice enough to offer moving one table down so that my girlfriends and I could sit in a four-seater setting instead of eating while facing the wall. This isn't something the restaurant can take credit for, but the customers in this establishment were really friendly, too - vouched for by one of my girlfriends who came before --  so it adds icing to the cake for ambience when the customers are friendly, too.

Final Grade = 65/100 = 3, shiny, golden stars!

TLDR: While this establishment isn't for the true carnivore, it is definitely recommended for small get-togethers or the curious/aspiring/potential vegan craving a hearty meal that won't leave you feeling like a giant ball of dense fat afterwards, or deprived of meat. Worth travelling for if you are in the GTA Area."}
{"text":"The food is excellent. The staff is very friendly and explains everything to you.
The place is also really clean. 
The wahn Burger was amazing. I love The kale chips too. 
My friend had the pulled pork panini with salad. This is a great vegetarian place that is very reasonably priced. 
I think I'm going to come back to game tomorrow.i"}
{"text":"Been here a few times and never had a bad meal here. Staff are always friendly and the food is always top notch! Rice poppers especially"}
{"text":"I am currently Yelping my way through Toronto and it has been a delight! What else is there to do with this on and off rain/down pour? But New York vegan & vegetarian restaurants have a thing or two to learn from this place! Yes, they do!! Food in Toronto is better in quality and taste than in NY. 

The ' \"Beef\" N' Mushroom Satays' and the 'Cold Creamy Potato Soup' were both, \"Omg, this is vegan!?\" You really don't miss the cream but I so wish it was a warm and not a cold soup. My one complaint with the Satays is watch the salt. Aside from that, keep up the excellent work!! 

Unfortunately, I must give you 4 Stars because you do not have a rice side and you were so good that I selfishly wished you have a larger menu.  Because Americans are used to getting more food, I have this dilemma here-if I order more, it'll be too much. But as it is, it's not enough for this 'Fat Kid' since portions are small."}
{"text":"Amazing food and service. The quality of food for the price can't be matched. Definitely my favourite restaurant in the city. They really understand and appreciate what it means to be a true vegetarian/vegan. Keep up the great work!"}
{"text":"Honestly, I've only ever had the Japanese Curry Bowl and that's all I'll probably ever order during my monthly visits to Grasshopper. Explosion of flavour, brings me back to the time I visited Japan and is the ultimate comfort food I constantly crave. The waitress suggested I order a side of fries, which I did and completely blew my mind. Or you could always order the curry fries, you do you. Whatever the daily drink is GET IT. So refreshing, quenching and healthy."}
{"text":"Grasshopper restaurant 
Some of the best vegetarian food I've ever had. The vegan  pulled pork sandwich was amazing and the side sauces were a perfect match. I tried the Stranger than fiction porter and it was excellent,  not to mention the amazing artwork."}
{"text":"Based off of the reviews and pictures I read and saw of Grasshopper I expected it to be much better than it was. I was very underwhelmed. 

Walking in the atmosphere was bright and casual, the staff was welcoming. We got the menus- selection was average and prices were average. They did not have two of the things we asked for, they ran out of coffee after I had one cup, they forgot some toppings on my friends burger and entirely forgot to ring in one of my friends order (which left her waiting for her food once ours had already arrived).

'Pulled pork' sandwich - average.
Veggie burger - below average. I could have gone to a chain restaurant and ordered a better veggie burger. 
Chicken fingers - good. My friends who recently became vegetarians miss chicken fingers and said these hit the spot. 
Kale salad - average and boring.
Mac and cheese - it's hard to find vegan mac and cheese, so it's nice to come across it... but it had an overwhelming garlic taste and wasn't anything amazing. (Wasn't bad though).
Brownie - good. 

Overall, I was disappointed by Grasshopper. I wanted it to be great so badly... but I will not be coming back here. I will continue looking for vegan restaurant options elsewhere in Toronto!"}
{"text":"My first time here was wonderful! My partner and I each got the lentil burger - tasty and filling by itself, with curry and kimchi upgrades for our side fries. We also got the quinoa mac and cheese, which was surprisingly flavorful. The fries alone really stole the show though, and we were very satisfied with the servings we were given.

Perhaps I was unlucky, but my second visit (party of 4) was a bit underwhelming, especially considering the price range for this place. My group was disappointed after I had hyped it up.

The servings seem significantly smaller without upgrades. Food-wise, the fries were softer than I had remembered, and the sauce in my burger (I believe I got the Wahn) wasn't evenly distributed so I got it all at the end. We got dessert this time around though, and agreed that the peanut butter blondie was fun.

I may (?) change my mind in the future, but an overall 3/5 felt appropriate after the last experience."}
{"text":"I wanted to like this place, especially when with my vegan girlfriend had nothing but high praise for this place. So maybe my expectations were too high but i found the place to be boring and just strange. Our server was very nice but seem to have zero ability to retain information, the people next to us asked her for an extra bun with their meal. So when the meal arrived, the girl asked about the second bun she ordered, and the response was pretty comical, the server quickly and politely replies \"it only comes with one bun\"  and the customer then reiterates, \"no, i ordered a second bun with the meal\" to which the server repeats \"sorry, but the meal only comes with one bun...\" the customer then re-explains \" i understand it comes with a bun already, but i ordered a second bun as well, so i should have 2\" the server then stares vacantly at the customer and says \"oh, ok, one moment\" then returns with a second bun. It was so hard not to burst out laughing at this ridiculous exchange. Now in regards to my meal, i had these garlic fries that were impossible to eat, there was just so much salt on them, they were pretty disgusting, my girlfriend of course enjoyed her meal, but i can't say i did, i found it all very bland with the exception of the salt and fries. with the way communication was with the server, i didn't bother raising the issue of the inedible fries. They also charged us for something we never ordered, so i was forced to go up to the cash and discuss it with the cashier who fixed it. Over all i can't say i'd want to return to this place. and as a footnote, there was no background music and with everyone clumped so tightly together in this very small nook of a place, it was really  weird listening to everyone chewing and such. it was just a really uncomfortable experience. I couldn't wait to leave. I will not be back."}
{"text":"As soon as I previewed the salad dressing I knew that for the next few weeks I'd be comparing everything against this meal, and nothing else could live up to it. It's exceedingly rare that a meal is as good as it looks, when it looks this damn good. (Decor here is nice too.) Grasshopper's chickn' and waffles is delectable! I'm in vegan heaven right now, luxuriating in the amazing textures and flavours. Also doesn't hurt that the server, Tara, is excellent at her job and a lovely human. The waffles are stunning - basil and rosemary makes them hands down the best I've ever had. The chickn is soft with a light, crisp breading, the greens are fresh, the dressing is gorgeous - perfectly balanced garlic/citrus, light/creamy, and, to literally top it all off, they brought real maple syrup. Bliss! I've never had this dish before but I will come here for it again, hopefully often. Oh, and bring cash! No credit accepted here."}
{"text":"Not sure I'd be back. It's not bad, but it's just okay-ish in taste and price. 

Pulled Pork Burger ($13) was okay, but my friend didn't like it; she felt there was a strange aftertaste. I can see where she's coming from. I found the flavours a bit muted and would've liked for it to be brighter, maybe. 

The Wahn Burger ($14) with a deep fried Portobello mushroom was good and definitely the most successful dish. 

The Mushroom Bowl ($13) with brown rice was a miss for me. It's kind of bitter and doesn't really have the great flavour I associate with mushrooms. The flavours felt a little jumbled and messy. 

I upgraded my side of fries to chilli cheese fries but I wouldn't quite call it chilli. It was more like salsa. More watery, less beans, more tomato chunks. And the fries themselves were on the softer/soggier side. 

Service was great. It was one person serving the six or so tables and she filled our water and checked on us whenever she had a free second. 

In general, it was okay. I just didn't find anything good enough for me to want to come back or recommend it to anyone."}
{"text":"Friendly service and delicious food. The \"pull pork\" made from seitan on a bun vietnamese style was chewy and flavorful. The classic \"beef\" burger was satisfying and I liked the pickles on it. The sesame fries were different being fried in sesame oil. I would have liked to try fries with sesame seeds attached to it. I recommend anyone try this restaurant!"}
{"text":"Definitely one of my favourite vegan restaurants in the GTA. Not only is the food delicious (sesame fries, drool) but the prices are also decent which is difficult to find when it comes to vegan resto's. The first time I came here the service matched the food, amazing. The servers suggested different juices to try, answered our questions about ingredients with so much detail/interest and all around were fantastical. 

The second time I came here, I was embarrassed I recommended it as a place for dinner to a friend. The two girls serving that night were anything but friendly or accommodating. They kept giving us our bill before we were ready for them. (i.e. every after we ordered something they brought us a new bill) I ordered a beer and didn't receive it until 15 minutes before they were closing (didn't know they closed so early on a Friday). They turned off the music 15 minutes before closing and started cleaning AROUND people who weren't done with their meals or drinks. The place is small so it was very awkward and uncomfortable. We felt like we were being rushed out. Bear in mind we arrived there at 8pm, the place closed at 10 so it's not like we just got there and had bombarded them with service 30 mins to closing. My friend and I have worked in customer service for a decade and understand that some customers are difficult and unfriendly so we didn't understand why they were being so rude because we were pleasant, said thank you whenever they brought us something AND STILL tipped them 18%. The servers gave off a contrived air of pretentious \"urban\" hipsters which is so annoying when it comes to a vegan lifestyle because that's why people who do eat animals scoff when you tell them you don't eat meat/animal products. And honestly, customer service is SO easy, just be super nice, attentive and accommodating. Job done! 

(But really, those sesame fries are top notch)"}
{"text":"I had the \"pork\" banh mi, and it was delicious. It had the exact taste and texture of pulled pork...it was unbelievable. I chose fries as my side. They were also delicious. They had an interesting flavor that I could not put my finger on. I recommend both!"}
{"text":"One of my favourite vegan spots in Toronto. Every bahn mi is delicious, especially pulled 'pork'. Sometimes the cleanliness could be improved (last visit there was green gunk inside the water bottle)."}
{"text":"I picked up the spicy black bean burger for lunch as was positively thrilled.  It came with fries or a salad.  Took a chance and got the salad and that proved to be as tasty as the burger.  A lot of carefully arranged flavours to please veg heads or meat lovers.    This is a place where taste comes first."}
{"text":"Fresher than Fresh, hop on south to Grasshopper. 

I tried:

-the Haru \"Spring\" Salad (8.5) with Gobo root fried chunks (1.5.). I would add the crispy breaded tofu cubes with it next time but I don't regret trying these things
-some of my mom's Mushroom 'N Rice bowl (10)
-pomegranate/mint/lemonade juice (4)
-pear/ginger juice (4).

 I'll obviously be back. Decent weeknight option."}
{"text":"The best vegan restaurant in Toronto, in my opinion. Chicken banh mi and chick-un nuggets are out of this world. Pulled pork banh mi is also excellent. 
People seem to rave about the quinoa Mac and cheese but I was not a fan. 
For dessert, I'd recommend the blueberry cheesecake (dairy free and gluten free)
Obviously I've been here a lot.. Prices are very reasonable, food is fantastic. Very friendly service too."}
{"text":"Bring a friend, order a chicken & a pulled pork Bahn Mi, swap halves..maybe get some Unchicken nuggets to start..have a drink or two, split a piece of blueberry cheesecake after. I friggin love this place. It's so perfect. Small, casual, tasty, affordable, loads of options, good service, excellent location."}
{"text":"We had avoided this placed for months because of the negative connotations \"vegan\" had for us. Turns out this was a HUGE mistake on our part.

We have now visited this location twice. We will definitely be back.

The atmosphere is bright and friendly and the service great.

The food is drop dead incredible.

The first time we went - my partner ordered the Wahn burger and declared it was impossible to tell it was not beef. He loved it. 

I got the CrispyWrap (I can't remember the full name, and because their menu is not viewable online, I cannot be exact). It's the only named Crispy wrap however. It came with a side of Sesame fries. The only regrettable part was that I was unable to finish and had to take half home. Those Sesame fries are UNBELIEVABLE.

The second time we went, my partner ordered the Pulled Pork sandwich, with Sesame fries and declared the meal amazing. Again, there was NO WAY the pulled pork tasted like anything but pork.

I ordered the waffles, served with a side salad, crispy vegan chicken chunks and organic Maple Syrup. WOW! Is pretty much all I can say. The portions are generous and again I had to take half home, but the taste is fabulous. Those crispy chunks of vegan chicken tasted like the real deal.

I would not hesitate to recommend this place to any of our friends - vegan or non - they will not be disappointed.

For me, this place i great. I have problems with meat, which seems to cause acidity and digestive issues. The Grasshopper works really well for me."}
{"text":"Came in from the cold yesterday, was immediately offered coffee/tea (which they didn't charge me for at all!) The waitress was super sweet, the vibe is very low-key, and you can come in and order take out. I had the chick'un banh mi with fries, and I ate almost all of it - it was the best meal I've had in a very long time!  Not normally one for french bread, theirs was soft and so delicious! The fries were slightly spiced and not too oily but very crispy. Everything was perfect! My food was out to me fast. I will be back again very soon, I think I've just found my new favorite spot!"}
{"text":"This is probably my fav vegan place ! Food is amazing and the service is great. Will come back often"}
{"text":"Nice small vegetarian restaurant amongst a line of Mexican restaurants in the area. Delightful atmosphere, staff and food. Lots of variety of different cultural food. From sloppy joe's to Japanese curry fries."}
{"text":"This is a very cute and small restaurant near Kensington market. When we got there, it was still closed even though it was a half hour past opening. Apparently, the server was running late, which I found quite amusing. (It was a beautiful day, so I didn't blame him!)

I got the portobello burger on a bun with kale salad (generously portioned, unlike some Thumbelina-sized kale-slaw you might find at Fresh). I'm used to eating pretty healthy food, so it was a surprise to find a deep-fried burger placed before me. Since the menu brims with comfort food, I shouldn't have been surprised, but it would have been helpful to state \"deep-fried\" in the description. Nevertheless, I ate the entire thing and now never have to wonder what a deep-fried porto tastes like.

At Grasshopper, you get decent, vegetarian comfort food at a reasonable price, which is a lot more than you can say about some other vegetarian restaurants in the city."}
{"text":"I love this place and their happy hour!

The staff is really welcoming and sweet. The girl at the front with blind and black hair was extremely kind. I had the power kale and cabbage salad which was great. Adding the fried gobo root chunks is a must.

Also, happy hour is pretty awesome, and the signature cocktails are pretty rad. Grasshopper kind of tastes like mint ice cream.

For dessert try the raspberry sorbet. :)

Oh and the bathrooms are pretty cool too."}
{"text":"Ordered the chick-un nuggets, haru salad with the recommended plum dressing, quinoa mac n cheese, and the pulled pork bahn mi with a side of fries.

Only items I really enjoyed were the bahn mi and the fries (which I dipped into the creamy bbq sauce that came with our chick-un nuggets). I want to buy a jar of that bbq sauce, it's so good! The \"pulled pork\" in the bahn mi was delicious, and was right on for texture and flavours.

I didn't like the mac n cheese at all (tasted bitter and didn't have a very thick consistency). The chick-un nuggets weren't chewy enough for my liking. The haru salad was quite ordinary as was the plum sauce dressing.

If I come back here, I'm def sticking to the bahn mis."}
{"text":"My friend and I, stumbled upon this place after coming back from Bunner's. 
I've always been a fan of anything vegan even though I am not vegan or vegetarian. 

The food here is DELICIOUS. I had the Quinoa Mac 'N Cheese and it was insanely good! Definitely the best vegan mac and cheese I've ever had. Ever! 
It was so creamy, it was hard to believe there wasn't any dairy in it. 
Their juices are also quite refreshing. I got the beet, apple and ginger - yummm.

My friend ordered the Chick-Un Nuggets and the Wahn Burger, I didn't try any since they weren't GF however, according to her it was amazing. But I did try the sesame fries and they were to die for! Def a must try. 

Our server was super friendly and polite. He was an absolute gem.
Can't wait to go back! Def looking forward to trying their GF donuts :) (yes, they have vegan and gf donuts! ahh)"}
{"text":"Came here on Valentine's day with my partner. Instead of opting for the Valentine special, which was a shared meal for $40, we ordered from the main menu (which we regretted).

For starters we ordered bruschetta, delicious but were really tiny! I wanted to order the chick'un wrap, but it was not available so I opted for the chick'un burger with sesame fries. My partner ordered the pulled pork sandwich with roasted potatoes. We were told these two items were really popular. The burger was really dry, even with the house dressing on it! The fries definitely saved the meal, really good and not an overpowering sesame flavour. The sandwich was also depressing, there wasn't much pork (pretty much eating 2 slices of bread) and the roasted potatoes were not completely cooked. 

Overall, the interior and ambiance of the establishment was nice but I probably will not be coming back again."}
{"text":"This was my first vegan restaurant and let me say that i was suprised how delicious it was.

I ordered the \"pulled pork\" banh mi sandwich with kale salad and it was savoury and tasty! 

The restaurant wasnt very busy on a Friday afternoon but service was still great.

Would definitely come back again to try their quinoa mac n'cheese."}
{"text":"Came here for a quick lunch, the food came out very quickly and was great! I had the tempeh sloppy joe sandwich (loved it) and the chili cheese fries (wasn't a fan of the beans/had a very sweet taste) overall the highlight of the meal was definitely the tempeh sloppy Joe, my friend ordered the \"beef\" burger - it was quite bland, he wasn't impressed. The chicken tenders to start were also quite average, im definitely coming back for the sloppy joe!"}
{"text":"First time here, but I have been to the College location before. I was craving chicken &  waffles but it's a brunch item and is not served after 4pm. Waitress recommended the chicken wrap which comes with a side of choice. It was crispy & delicious and portions are satisfying. I strongly recommend it.

For sweets I recommend the walnut brownies. Their cheesecake is delicious but it's too tiny for $7.

Overall more spacious than the College location. Wonderful service even though we came during closing time. Next time I'm coming during brunch for some chicken & waffles."}
{"text":"I tried their chicken burger, chicken curry bowl, and chili. The chicken burger was delicious and so was the curry bowl. One of the best mock chickens I have ever tasted. Curry was so legit and tasted better than what authentic restaurants have to offer. The chilli bowl was tiny and lacked texture, not worth $7. I don't recommend it.

Overall great experience. I'm surely coming back to try out a different burger."}
{"text":"To be quite honest, this is not my favourite vegan place, and I have never returned because the food we had was not very good. 3 friends and I all split the chili, quinoa mac & cheese, pulled pork banh mi, and spicy black bean burger. The two things we agreed were decent were the black bean burger and the kale chips that were served with them. The rest of the food was bland and forgettable. We are big eaters, and we didn't even finish everything, unfortunately, we left feeling disappointed."}
{"text":"As I long-time vegetarian, I usually shy away from fake meats in favor of salads, tofu, and other less processed foods, but I just had to try the vegetarian pulled pork sandwich here. It was delicious, as was the small kale salad served with it.  We also had the rice poppers, a wonderful appetizer. The waitress was really helpful and told us ahead of time that the portions were large, which they were.  Very tasty food. I would love to come again next time I'm in Toronto!"}
{"text":"I'm not vegan or vegetarian,  but I really like this place.  It's their 2nd location.  Although I will miss Little fish, I'm pleased with this new addition to the neighbourhood.  

Lots of options that are vegan and sound really interesting.  It's not just salad folks.  There's bowls,  burgers and even \"chicken\"  and waffles. 

On weekends they are open at 930am (brunch!).  

I had the Kale and Cabagge salad with Gobo Root on the side.  That was a nice addition and was tasty with a crunch.  The brunch bowl looked really yummy too. 

Also worth checking out are their juices and smoothies.  I'd come by just for take out of that. 

Looking forward to coming back soon!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite vegan restaurants in town. Their kale chips are to die for, and even though the sesame fries were a little salty, they still tasted great. I ordered one of their burgers, I do not remember the name, it was one that was made out of portobello mushrooms and cheese, and then it was deep fried. The burger tasted amazing, the service was awesome, and the prices were very reasonable, I would be coming back soon. 

This is a prime example that vegan food does not have to be boring, or its only salad. Their menu is amazing, and the prices are very affordable. Its definitely worth the try :)"}
{"text":"I love this place!

1) Great value  - meals under $10 and happy hour for $5 a drink!
2) The food is excellent - love the spicy black bean burger, the mac and cheese and chick-un banh mi are must haves!
3) Although a vegetarian menu - it is a great place for both vegetarians and non alike!
4) The service is always very welcoming and friendly. This place is a bit understaffed and thus a bit slow at times, but usually I go out to enjoy the company of my friends - not too concerned about speed! 

I have been here a few times and will certainly be back."}
{"text":"This is the kind of establishment that \"Mercy for Animals\" would support. 

Vegan food doesn't need to be primary, flavorless, insipid, crunchy and cold. It can be hearty, filling, creamy, tender, juicy: mysterious. How do they cook and what does the fake chicken has on it? Wow! It felt, looked and tasted exactly the same...

I ordered a mushroom bowl with a side I've never heard in my life: Gobo root. I was starving, prepared to eat everything and leave room for a tapa/taco/torta on Kensington, however, this dish was made to satisfy. I guilty left 3-5 chopstick carries. I even gave up on the last 2 sips of my flying monkey beer. My partner was the same with his fake chicken sandwich.

Congratulations to this place, I would need to check in when in the area. Now, I have no excuse to avoid meat when I'm close by.

I'll try to bring more friends.

Service was kind of slow, so they are on Grabb if you want to order ahead."}
{"text":"I have been dying to go to a vegan/vegetarian restaurant forever. I've always wanted to try the food and I know people who are vegans so this recommendation came from them. I would definitely say this, I will come back here with my vegan friends or my boyfriend's cousin, just to hang out because the atmosphere was so welcoming and inviting. I almost didn't want to leave the first time.
I've never tried food like this before so I didn't know what to expect. What I got totally blew me out of the water though.
The aesthetics of the place were cute and nice. Everything was so clean cut but it was in a way that made the place look quaint and humble. Not to mention, it reminded me of a little nook off of downtown or a small cabin/house. Again, it was cute! The interior designer in me was ecstatic.
I tried the pomegranate mint lemonade to start off from the menu. It was so refreshing. I loved the sweetness of it and yes, it is pretty sweet and you can taste the freshness of the ingredients in the lemonade - especially in the mint. 
I wanted to try the kale chips but our server told us that they had run out or they weren't on the menu today. I've been having a hankering for kale since I've tried it and I couldn't shake it. Needless to say, I was a little disappointed. Fortunately, the server gave us a suggestion of this vegan chilli cheese fries. And good god, was it ever good! I honestly couldn't tell that it was vegan as in no animals were used to make this food and it was super delicious. I swear I gobbled that thing right up. Well, honestly, I had to pace myself because it was very hot and burning my tongue was not an option. Either way, this was too good to pass up.
For my entree, I decided to get the miso vegetable bowl. This was a huge portion, I wasn't exactly prepared for that. The bowl contained a lot of veggies and the tofu gave it an even balance which I really liked about the dish. 
Overall, the service was really good and the server was very helpful with suggestions about food and drinks. So if you are stuck in what to order, ask for their advice. They're really knowledgeable about what is in the food and how it tastes and to top it off, they're really passionate about it. 
The place is very cozy, I can't stress this enough. I went in for lunch and I stayed for more than a couple of hours.
Because I did go in for lunch, I suggest you go early because the place filled up really fast. They do take out as well but I suggest staying for the bite to eat. You won't regret it."}
{"text":"I came here with a friend on an early Saturday evening.  I was shocked that they were already full at 5ish.  I thought people in TO didn't start eating till 7ish.  Guess I was wrong, guess they eat 24/7.  

Anyways, I ordered the pulled \"pork\" banh mi with sesame fries, and the beet apple ginger juice.  The pulled pork had great flavour but not overly sweet or BBQish so if you like eating comfort food but with a less strong flavour, then I'd recommend it (this is actually a compliment - sometimes I find places douse the places with too much sauce). The fries were great too.  

The beet apple ginger juice had a good mix sweetness with ginger flavour. I loved it.  

While this place is pretty small and they get busy quickly, the service was still great.  

Also, a lot of vegan places are over-priced (even though it'd be cheaper to make than meat based dishes), however for the venue, it was very reasonable. I paid about $16 before tip which is not bad.

Verdict: Good place for comfort vegan food in the T-dot at a reasonable price.  I'll be back."}
{"text":"I came here once for take out and was sorely disappointed. I order the vegetable miso bowl and while the flavours were really yummy I kid you not the vegetables consisted of one coin of zucchini, 2 of eggplant and one strip of yellow pepper with minced cucumber on top compared to huge amount of rice. Definitely not worth the 11 dollars. I then reluctantly went back with my family because they loved it. This time we dined it and it lived up to their praise. We shared the mushroom bowl, pulled pork bahn mi, and beef satay all of which was delish and heftily portioned! My favourite was the mushroom bowl. It was rich and earthy. I'll definitely be heading back again."}
{"text":"Love this place. 

Food here is original and delicious. You can have great salad with a Japanese flare, a burger, a soup, sandwiches. They make fresh juices, desserts, serve beer. 

Service is attentive and quick. Also not pushy. 

Has the vibe of a vegetarian pop-up. But with solid wood decor, thoughtful lighting, delicious food. I'm surprised to see its current yelp rating!"}
{"text":"Ordered from UberEATS...enjoyed my meal so much!! I would order here again!! Japanese curry bowl, sesame fries, rice poppers...all delicious"}
{"text":"This is the second time I've come to Grasshopper and it's so good! 

The first time I came I ordered the chick-un bahn mi and it was delicious. This time I ordered the pulled pork bahn mi and it was even better! I was so surprised by the \"meat\" since it looks and feels like real meat. Also make sure to try the salad as a side! The dressing is amazing and it's so good! 

This is definitely now one of my favourite restaurants."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my meal here. The waitress we had was super friendly and answered any questions that we had.  It was a great atmosphere. Even the dessert was fantastic.  I highly recommend the beet juice.
The place was clean.  Bathrooms were well stocked and tidy.  
It's definitely a place I would come back to."}
{"text":"Love it! Nothing but compliments for this place. Pricey, but absolutely delicious and worth it. The \"chicken\" bahn mi is amazing and their sodas and cocktails delicious. I've eaten here about once a month for the past four years. 

It's also a great vegan place to take non-vegetarian or vegan friends. They've always been very pleasantly surprised and frequently ask me to take them back."}
{"text":"I got the vegan mac and cheese with kale chips. Total vegan comfort food. The mac and cheese was tasty and comforting. It was also pretty light, which is nice since heavy foods make me sleepy. The kale chips were also really good, they tasted like spicy fries, and I wished there were more.

Looking forward to going back and trying out more of their dishes!"}
{"text":"With some good vegetarian friends in town for a visit, I decided to challenge myself to eating no meat for 24 hours. The good news is, I made it through to the end (and rewarded myself with charcuterie plates and chicken & waffles the next day). So take this review with a grain of salt, as it is coming not from a vegetarian but a meat loving dude who is open minded enough to step outside his comfort zone.

We came here for dinner and I was surprised how busy this restaurant was for a mid-week dinner. But we settled into this quaint little College St restaurant and had a pretty decent time. The restaurant itself seats about 20-25 people, is bright but cozy, and has washrooms in the basement per usual Toronto restaurant situations. 

Drink menu has no beer on tap, but an adequate selection of Ontario brewed bottles at $6 each. Cocktails are $8-$10 and glasses of wine are $7.50, which in todays current drinking climate are actually reasonable prices.

Foodwise, it was a perfectly passable meal. I had the \"Pulled Pork\" banh mi with sesame fries. The \"pulled pork\" was sweet but had a bit of a funny flavour to it, which I'm guessing is due to whatever soy based meat substitute was in it. The sesame fries at first tasted really unique and interesting, but were incredibly salty so as the meal went on got less appealing.
Only other positive or negative notable feedback from my fellow diners was: the kale chips were imbalanced in their preparation, so some sections were crispy and the other sections still wilty and squishy. 

So basically, it was good and the pricing is reasonable. Unfortunately, there was no wow factor so even in my most potentially insane future decisions to stop eating meat, I'm not sure this place will be a high priority to return."}
{"text":"Eating out as a vegetarian/vegan is always difficult, but luckily at places like Grasshopper we plant eaters can order ANYTHING from the menu (and big plus for being able to afford it too)!

There's a Grasshopper location on College, pretty close to UofT and Chinatown, but this afternoon we ventured out to the Junction since en route to High Park. 

Food- 4/5. The menu is very diverse - salads, brown rice bowls, sandwiches and veggie burgers. Some vegan sweet treats are available at the front counter. We ordered the \"chicken\" nuggets (with BBQ sauce - we were recommended this flavor over the peanut sauce!) and turmeric tofu scramble as apps. Tip - the appetizers are pretty small, so don't plan on using them as mains. I loved the tofu scramble even though it was small and really simple - literally just seasoned tofu. The texture was more chewy and less watery and the flavor definitely soaked through. For mains we ordered the Haru salad and the beet burger with a side of sesame fries. The Haru salad was not that great tbh since it had too high of a green leaves:toppings ratio lol. There weren't that many kidney beans or chickpeas (all at the bottom of the bowl). But upsides were that it appeared huge, the dried gobo flakes were interesting and reminded me of much thinner taru chips which I adore, and the plum sauce was a refreshing addition. The beet burger looked really anticlimactic and the patty itself (beet pink!) looked funky but tasted so bland and boring. I did like how the bun was whole wheat and a slice of lotus root came with it. Don't bother ordering the fries - they are just basic McD's thin-cut fries and very ordinary.

PS. They do have a small brunch menu here, including \"chicken\" + waffles

Value- 5/5. Spent ~$38 for 2 people and all that food not incl tip. Pretty solid value for sit-down style vegan"}
{"text":"$18 before tax and tip for vegan mac with \"pulled pork\" is a bit on the pricey side for the amount of food you actually get. As a vegan myself I'd like to support this business more, but I don't think this was particularly dish was worth it. 

The pork is pretty dry and chewy, which did not lend well to the otherwise decent pasta. Based on this I wouldn't be too keen on the pulled pork sandwich either. All in all, I'd rather make some of this food at home myself. I guess the only plus side is that this is decent food to introduce to your omnivore friends."}
{"text":"Their chickn nuggets, sesame fries, and rice poppers are all amazing. The mac and cheese is good. 

The chili is underwhelming, as are the bahn mi."}
{"text":"Really liked the veggie versions of the chicken and the pulled pork sandwiches. My son, who loves meat and is allergic to dairy, liked the vegan mac n' cheese. The beer selection wasn't large, but it was nice that they offered different alcohol options. The sesame fries were awesome. My wife enjoyed her veggies with miso.  The place was small but charming. The prices were reasonable."}
{"text":"I am not a vegan myself but I've tried quite a variety of vegan restaurants and this one is definitely one of my favorites. I ordered the pulled pork mac n cheese but got to try the chick-un burger, pulled pork sandwich, soup and fries as well. Everything was delicious! 

The chick-un and pulled pork tasted very similar to real meat which I was pleasantly surprised about, and the mac and cheese was \"cheesy\" enough to satisfy my cheese cravings. I also loved how I didn't feel stuffed or that the food was too \"heavy\" even after finishing the entire meal  like I normally would after eating real pulled pork/mac n cheese. 

Would love to come back when I'm in the area again!"}
{"text":"I've had my eye on this place for a couple of months and finally got around to eating at Grasshopper this week. Twice. That's kind of un-heard of for me, but this place is totally worth it.

I've been served by two different waitresses at Grasshopper-both are absolutely gorgeous, friendly and efficient. The menu is fresh, healthy, full of variety and easily accommodates all eating preferences/dietary requirements. I can happily take my vegan sister and omni  boyfriend here for a meal and all leave satisfied. Could eat their banh mi buns all day. Portions are completely adequate so whoever thought they were not must have a pretty extensive appetite!

Usually Fresh is my go-to place to eat out, but Grasshopper has totally outdone them for me. The food is just better, the price is far more reasonable and I much prefer giving my money to an independent business. Try them out, you won't regret it."}
{"text":"super happy with the food here.  the naturally sweetened strawberry soda was the perfect amount of sweetness.  the food was also great.  definitely would recommend to vegetarians and meat eaters alike."}
{"text":"Some people assume vegan food it has to be healthy or isn't flavorful. 
Many vegans and vegetarians  stopped eating meat not because we didn't like the taste of meat, we stopped because how the meat/dairy industry work. 
Now I can enjoy the taste of chicken fingers, burgers, pulled pork without actually eating meat and enjoying the taste of meat, pork and chicken (I don't know how the do it but it really tastes like meat). 
Unlike other vegan restaurants this one is very affordable and makes it easy to try many thinks of the menu.     
I've been here twice in a week... And I'm loving it (para pa pa pa)"}
{"text":"As others have said, the prices here are really quite good for what you get.  A welcome change from a lot of overpriced vegan restaurants you'll find around town.

Anyways, my dining companion and I split on the chicken nuggets, which disppared fast -- these are REALLY good.  She took the rice & mushroom bowl while I tried the sloppy joe burger (with a kale & radish salad on the side).  Both were fine but neither of them were things we'd order again.  We had a beet/apple/ginger juice on the side.  Seemed to be a bit short on ginger but it was delicious.

Overall this place still deserves four stars despite not being really enthused about our mains."}
{"text":"I looooved Grasshopper. It's very small, intimate and simple. The food was delicious and my drink (the fabhopper, basically a cosmo) was well made. To start we had kale chips which were a bit greasier than I'm used to but still quite good. That was followed by \"beef\" satays and curry tomato soup. Oh. My. God. The soup was amazing, so full of flavour and spice while still focusing on the tomatoes themselves. My friend got a kale and cabbage salad which was huge, had lots of interesting components and was extremely tastey. For dessert we both ordered sorbet which was of a very high quality, as if we were simply eating iced fruit. Our server was a doll, very sweet and earnest but not at all overbearing. I'll definitely be back here, if only isnt wasn't so out of my way. It's perfect for a date, casual meal with friends, a snack, drinks...it's so up my alley and I'm thrilled I tried it out."}
{"text":"The sandwiches and kimchi fries were a definite hit, but the sesame fries were overwhelmingly seasoned, and very greasy. But we would definitely go back to try the rest of the menu. I was surprised that the food was so amazing and inexpensive. This is what I would call a neighbourhood gem, your meat eater friends would also be very satisfied and not know the food is completely vegan! Amazing chick-un burger, a must try!"}
{"text":"I am not a vegan but I decided to try this place and I was not disappointed. I ordered the \"Pulled pork\" sandwich and sesame fries. The pulled pork was extremely tasty and had a real meat like texture. The fries however tasted a bit salty but I think it was because of the sesame. I then had the chocolate zucchini bread which also was amazing. I did not miss meat at all I would recommend this place to both vegans and non vegans!"}
{"text":"NOT WORTH THE MONEY 

Walked by and stopped for a coffee and stayed for lunch
The first lady that took my order was really friendly but didn't take anytime to come and check up on me.

The food was basic at its best there are way better vegetarian places in the city for the same price.
I had the Japanese curry bowl and it was watery and vary bland with no taste. Hardly any veggies and rice all flotting in a pool of gravy.. I also ordered a iced coffee with almond milk which was the worst thing I have ever had, it was warn and the coffee it self tasted like it was day old burnt coffee. The second witress that I asked for the bill I told the iced coffee was horrible and asked not to be charged for it (as I didn't drink it.. just a sip) and she said she can't do that. I asked for the manager and she said there is no manager there and I would have to come back next week to speck to the manager... really wow customer service can be better...  so all-in-all I wasted $18.50 and to some people that's not a lot but for me it is."}
{"text":"I've always been meaning to try this vegan restaurant, and after coming for the first time, I can safely say that it did not disappoint. I opted for the \"pulled pork\" burger, which was good and flavoured very well. It was definitely reminiscent of the actual pulled pork sandwiches I had before I became vegetarian. Additionally, you should definitely opt for the side of soup; the soup of the day was a broccoli cheddar, which was absolutely delicious. My only complaint would be their fries: my friend got the fries, which had a nice sesame oil taste, but they were also really really salty. Hopefully it was just a one-time mishap, I'm sure their fries are normally delicious!

Our waitress was helpful with the menu options. She was very knowledgeable about not only their food, but the origins of the alcohol that they serve, as well.

Verdict: Definitely want to come back and try their other signature menu items."}
{"text":"A nice veggie place offers pretty good food. Prices and services are good. But they take only cash or debit."}
{"text":"It's getting worse. It's actually getting worse. Chicken burger was super dry. Bun was flaking into bits and pieces. They put the thinnest layer of what tastes like sugar paste on the bun. I ordered a $5 side salad and it was literally a handful of mixed greens with 8 pumpkin seeds on it. Come on! I just can't anymore. I wish it didn't have to be this way."}
{"text":"I love the location! Really small and cozy. The waitress was really nice.
I had a juice (beet, apple and ginger) and it was very tasty! A bit too gingery to my taste but still very good.
I had the quinoa mac and cheese with kale chips and it was delicious! I loved the chips.
Will definitely recommend this place :)

I have to change my review to 4 stars. Went back a second time with 2 friends. The waitress was totally overwhelmed and there were only 10 people in the restaurant... It took her 30min to give us water, and that is because we asked, that is bad.
The service was slow... 30min, even for our juices.

I had the pomegrade and mint lemonade and it pretty taste!
I had the chick-un burger with sesame fries and it was really good! I thought i was eating chicken!"}
{"text":"Just keep in mind. Their signature burger, \"Chick Un\" burger is cooked from frozen. So on busy days when the chef is overwhelmed, you might bite into a frozen pseudo chicken. As I did. 

Try to \"pulled pork\" made a primarily carrots. Much better and hard to mess up."}
{"text":"This is artery clogging, coma-inducing vegan fast food at it's finest. Hey! No one ever said that veganism guarantees a healthy lifestyle! There are healthy choices on the menu but of course we all know which is more alluring.

This place certainly deserves all the hype, hoola and rave. We arrived no a random Thursday evening to an empty space with only 2 other patrons. The service is quick and efficient; nothing over the top and it shouldn't have to be. We had a curry and mushroom bowls  to which later our tummies lived to regret this as it was way too filling. Both dishes were extremely rich in texture and flavours. The curry is rich, thick yet light on flavour - reminiscent of tahini. It worked very well in the dish with grains and vegetables. The mushroom bowl was full of earthy, umami flavours-- very satisfying. The only thing they can improve upon is maybe downsizing the portions a bit (yes, it's true) and maybe add some sort of fresh or pickle elements to the dishes to really cut the richness. On a side note, the dishes are a little greasier than they need to be.

All in all, a fantastic fast food alternative that will surely satisfy!"}
{"text":"Love this place one of my favorite vegan restaurant food. The bowl is my number 1 choice. But other stuff are good like the kimchy fries. The drinks are good as well you should try the hot chocolate. Definitely recommend to visit this place. The servers were very nice and suggestive they let us keep eating even past the closing time, which was nice of them. Will definitely come by again."}
{"text":"Very yummy vegan cuisine. Had the chicken fingers (soooo good!), spicy black bean burger and salad. Love it!!"}
{"text":"I really really like this spot. 

The area does not have a lot of options for light eating (e.g. lunch) and this is a welcome welcome addition. The salads are reasonably priced (for the area) and delicious. Definitely beats Fresh. The staff is always cheerful and helpful. 

If you want a specific recommendation, I'll say the Spring (\"Haru\") Salad. Haven't been there for dinner nor tried the drinks.

Keep up the good work."}
{"text":"The service was extremely slow. 
When I walked in I was surprised at how small the place in, but we were seated in a couple minutes, and our order was taken fairly quickly. 
Although the waitress was very nice and hospitable, it took over an hour for our food to reach our table. To add insult to injury, there were only about four other small groups in the restaurant, and two of them who were seated after us got served before us!
I had a salad, which as salads go was pretty tasty, but the quantity was quite small for the price ($8). My friend had the Mac and cheese - and this was the biggest let down. The sauce was very bland, and I don't know if it was the \"vegan pasta\" but it tasted BAD. Very tasteless, almost like cardboard! The sauce served with that was not appealing at all, and the overall quantity was even less than my salad - quite a waste of $9. 
All in all, I would not visit this restaurant again. 2 stars are only for the decent salad and the courteousness of the waitress."}
{"text":"The first couple of times I ate here, it was amazing. But I've had a couple of less-than-stellar experiences since then. So I've concluded that some dishes are great and some not so much. For example, definitely go for the \"chicken\" nuggets appetizer or the tempeh sloppy joe if they catch your eye, but don't bother with the mac and cheese. Also the sesame fries are touch-and-go; first time I was there they were great, but the last time they were pretty average. 

Basically, it's still a good place for vegans to come for a bit more variety on the menu- but if you order something you like the first time, stick with it if you go again :)"}
{"text":"We recently visited this restaurant for a double date and were very impressed. Two things that make this restaurant stand out: taste and value. The dishes are noticeably cheaper than Fresh, Live, and Grasslands. The smoothies were all good, if a little small. We tried smoothies P, Y, and matcha banana. I guess I'm used to my homemade smoothies which I serve in a glass that could also be a vase. 
For our mains, we ordered the mac n cheese, mushroom and rice bowl, pulled pork banh mi, and the classic beefy burger. The mac n cheese, was underwhelming as it didn't taste much like \"regular\" mac n cheese. There was a gritty taste to it, and it was missing my favourite part, the crust on top. I didn't get  a chance to try the burger, but was told it was good but the fries were just okay. The rice bowl was very good and filling. The taste of mushrooms was very strong, which I loved. There also seemed to be a variety of mushrooms in the dish, which was great. The banh mi was okay, the dressing for the side kale salad was fantastic. I like banh mi with about a 50-50 ratio of meat to veggies. There were only about 3 sprigs of cilantro in the sandwich to go along with a very tasty pile of pulled pork.  They should have added more cilantro along with some pickled veggies, which is what I'm used to seeing in a banh mi. Luckily the siracha on the table saved the sandwich. 
For dessert we had a peanut butter cookie (it was nice and soft on the inside but was served cold, it should have been warmed) and a chocolate and cucumber loaf (we couldn't taste the cucumber at all, which was unfortunate). 
Overall, I liked the restaurant as the service was great and the prices were excellent. Also, free wi-fi, yea!"}
{"text":"This establishment exceeded all of my vegan expectations! The service was great (very personable and generous)- the food was extravagant and the cocktails were surprisingly delicious! Such a great menu with a diverse selection of options"}
{"text":"I've been here a few time and always had a weird experience. 

The latest was last night. We met up with some friends to go for dinner and decided on Grasshopper on College. It's a tiny restaurant so we were expecting to wait for a table. No big deal to find the restaurant full when we arrived. 

I asked the server how long it might be for a table. She replied that they had a reservation for 4 so they would be seated first, then whenever a table was ready we would be next, and said it could be around an hour because everyone had just sat down. 

I said \"no problem, can I put my name and number down?\"

Server's reply: \"we don't really do that here\". 

Okay. So you're expecting us to wait outside for an hour? WTF? We left and went somewhere else. 

Other experiences have been extremely long waits for food/to be even acknowledged and the restaurant being out of most of their menu. They only have one server who is responsible for all the takeout, tables, phone calls, being the cashier etc.. I feel sorry for her but she also seems so apathetic about the whole thing. 

Anyway, last night was the last straw. I won't be going back there. There's comparable and even better vegan joints all around that area so there's lots to choose from."}
{"text":"Terrible experience. I was starving, so at first I thought the rice balls were good, but they were actually cold in the centre. I ordered the tempeh sloppy joe, and despite what it said on the menu, it came infested with PICKLES. I hate pickles so much, and the taste of them seeped through the whole thing. The tempeh was also cold and just not good at all. Soup was nasty. Service was insensitive. I won't be going back."}
{"text":"I had dinner at Grasshopper with my gluten-free, soy-free vegan friend last week. The restaurant is smaller, fits about 20 I'd say, and simple in decor. The wait staff were really nice and took our orders on an iPad which was neat. 

The menu isn't huge, which I actually appreciated (Cough*Fresh*Cough) and the options are twists on the usual classics. The entire menu is vegan, and gluten-free options are clearly identified. 

What we ordered: Quinoa mac and cheese with kale chips, and the Mushroom 'n Rice Bowl.

The good: High in flavour! Not at all artificial or salty like alot of vegan cheeses or sauces. The prices are also incredibly reasonable. 

The bad: The portions are a bit on the smaller side, but good for lunch or for sharing if you order a few.

The ugly: Nothing. I'll definitely be back to try some of the drinks and other meals."}
{"text":"This place was fantastic ! Came here on a Friday evening and the place was pretty busy. Tried the London fog cocktail which was one of the most unique cocktails I've ever had! It was creamy and delicious. I opted for the mushroom and rice bowl which was absolutely delicious. I tried some of my friends' sesame fries which were amazing. 

Everything here was very creative and unique. Portions were perfectly sized and a great value. Service was attentive and helpful. Would definitely return !"}
{"text":"Tried coming here a few years back a couple of times but never ate here because the staff wasn't the friendliest. My Mom dragged me here this year & I'm happy she did. The staff was pleasant, service was quick, food was bomb and they make a damn good cocktails too. I'm now a fan of this place. I'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"When dietary restrictions prevent you from eating anywhere that serves milk or eggs there are not many options.  Vegan restaurants always provide the best options.  Sometimes they're a little snooty, sometimes they're a little expensive.  Sometimes they're really not that tasty at all.

The Grasshopper has none of the failings - and all of the wonders - of a great Vegan restaurant.

I had the \"pulled pork\" for $12.00, which came with a side of fries.  I couldn't believe the quality of the food.  Had I not known it was Vegan, I would have assumed it was meat.  Now that I know it's vegan I can't imagine how they replicated the texture so perfectly.  I have had a lot of pulled pork in my day, and this \"pulled pork\" is right up there with some of the best.

They also have \"Chick-un\" Burgers, and a number of other options.  If you're looking to keep meat, dairy, and eggs away from the plate - or just willing to experiment - you can't go wrong with The Grasshopper.

The colouring books and crayons for children are also a delight.  This led me to feel when my son started crying out, I didn't have to worry.  It's a family friendly environment.  They have two high chairs available for those who need them."}
{"text":"Sesame fries!!! Yesssss please!!!! Bowl of chili goodness!!! Yessss please!!! Finish off with a generous cut of double chocolate brownie!!! Yesssss please!!!! :) Will be returning here to try other menu items for sure:)"}
{"text":"Service was great! I ordered the Portobello burger with mushroom soup and a bowl of Mac and Cheese. The server seemed shocked that I was going to eat all the food but was happy about my enthusiasm.

When my food came out, I was sad to see that my Mac and Cheese want a Mac and Cheese but was a mushroom and rice dish, when I told her she felt so bad but me appropriate changes. 

The only started downfall of this place is that their probs aren't that big, cause I ate everything and left not really that full, but it could also be that I'm a pig, not sure which so I'll still leave my review at 5 stars"}
{"text":"The spiced kale chips are amazing!

The gazpacho was a bit odd though, I felt like I was drinking tomato sauce."}
{"text":"I've been to both Grasshopper locations (this one I visited second), and unfortunately the food not only didn't impress me, I found some of it inedible. 

I went with a group of six, four adults and two kids, and I was the only vegan among them. Given that we chose to come to Grasshopper due to my eating vegan, I ended up feeling pretty bad/guilty by the end of the meal since no one seemed to be enjoying their food (including me). 

The alternate location has a Japanese curry vegetable bowl that a friend got me when I went the last time, and so when I got to the College Street location and saw that they had a curry bowl with \"chick-un\" I got pretty excited. I was hoping I could swap out the fake meat for the veggies from the miso bowl, but when I asked the waitress she told me that wasn't possible (even if I paid extra). Given that they already have the veggies for the miso bowl, I'm not sure why that was an impossibility. 

I wasn't interested in breaded and fried \"chicken,\" so I opted for the haru salad with added tofu. When I got my meal I realized that the tofu was also breaded and fried. That was my mistake in reading the menu, but I wish they had options that were not fried. I ended up picking off all of the breading because not only did it make the meal far less healthy, it also didn't taste good. 

My dining companions had:
-\"Chick-un Banh Mi\"
-Tempeh Sloppy Joe burger
-Spicy Black Bean burger
-\"Pulled Pork\" Banh Mi

My friend's daughter who ordered the Sloppy Joe wasn't happy with the texture or flavor, so that meal went pretty much uneaten. Her mom ended up picking apart her meal so that her daughter had something to eat. (Our waitress didn't stop by to ask how we were liking the food, and so nobody noticed that there was a relatively untouched meal).

Given what felt like vegan fast food that lacked in quality, taste, and originality, I thought the prices were too high."}
{"text":"Definitely a go-to spot for every vegan and vegetarian! They have a brunch special and a meal of the day special. Friendly staff and great ambiance. Try their \"chick-un\" burger!"}
{"text":"They make the best soups here and you won't leave feeling hungry--overall it's the pretty good balance of hearty and healthy. The 'fake meat' dishes, like the chick-un nuggets, are also a good option. Although some of the menu items are likely to have come into contact (or contain) gluten, the menu does a good job of pointing out gf options.

Service here was very friendly and helpful. I'm not vegan, but I would definitely come back for another visit. The only drawback is the proliferation of spicy flavourings, which renders some diverse and interesting flavours to \"tastes like burning\"."}
{"text":"my gf is vegan and i wanted to order sum takeout, so i ordered grasshopper from just-eat.ca.  kkkk so first off i got the  pulled pork banh bi- so hekka good i give it a 9/10 because there was just a bit too much sauce but the bun was delicious and so was the \"meat\" omg so good u should deffs get this one for shniz. next i got a vegetable burger- 6/10 not the best, once again way too much sauce (and im a lover of sauce i am often told that i love sauce a lil too much) it was v average but the buns were gud.  next things next: the vegan mac and cheese.  Yo dawg, idk what i was thinking ordering this one.  JK i do know what i was thinking.  I was thinking \"kraft dinner\", and the thing i got was the opposite of kraft dinner.  weird long noods, half of the were whole wheat (wtf?)  v garlicky (which im ok with) weirldly dry and creepily creamy. maybe they're really good by \"vegan food\" standards but by regular peep standards NO.  lastly, i got the vegan chili- this one was good, it was nice, it was better than average.  If I had to grade it, it'd be the kid who sat at the side of the classroom, didnt speak up much, but tried his hardest and did all his homework.  He got out of class with a B minus, which isn't amazing, but his mom gave him a nice \"good job\" and his dad gave him a pat on the back and a wink."}
{"text":"Ordered quinoa Mac n cheese with pulled pork 
8/10
The Mac n cheese doesn't taste like cheese But it's flavorful. Like the texture of quinoa mac.
The pulled pork was chewy, salty and sweet. Delicious!"}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of Grasshopper. I have only ever been to their location on College St. It is quite small and cozy - only room for about 6 tables and a bar. The decor is bright and fresh. I made the critical \"mistake\" of ordering the 'Pulled Pork' on my first visit and I haven't been able to stray from it since! Although, I must admit, everything I've seen coming out of that kitchen looks phenomenal. I think the next thing I'll try if I ever get tired of the 'pulled pork' (unlikely) will be the Japanese curry bowl. The pulled pork is hands down the best I have ever had - vegan or not! The flavour is sweet and smoky with a creamy and refreshing slaw. I have had this sandwich SO MANY TIMES and it never disappoints. They do tend to change up the bun from time to time. Pssssst *stick with the Kaiser roll*  The staff have always been very friendly and the service is quick! Great spot for a quick vegan lunch!"}
{"text":"After reading about this place on blogto.com - I decided I had to try it out with a Vegan friend of mine.  What caught my eye on the menu?  Quinoa mac and cheese - need I say more?  Quinoa macaroni that resembles the noodles you get with Kraft Dinner - and it just got better from there.  It was absolutely delicious!  It came with a small side of Kale chips with two different sauces - a red-pepper and a pesto concoction - there wasn't really enough to dip the Kale chips into, but that's ok, I added it the mac and cheese, and OMG it kicked the mac and cheese up a notch!  If I didn't know it was vegan dish, I would never have guessed.  We also tried the Chick-Un Nuggets - very yummy!  The space is lovely, the service was very good, and the prices are very reasonable.  Veggies and Carnivores alike will be very happy here - No doubt that I will be returning to Grasshopper!"}
{"text":"Have gone back....

Had the Japanese curry bowl and I do not recommend it. They are very stingy on the vegetables (there is no protein component in the dish). Some of the vegetables were quite mushy.  You just eat a lot of rice and brown bland sauce with this one.

Kimchi fries were ok. The kimchi is super super mild, so a bit disappointing. But I've definitely had worse.

My dinner date had the mushroom burger and side soup of the day. No complaints, although the spicy soup was almost too spicy (and this person can handle spicy food).

If I'm in the hood I may stop by again but not making a special trips for this place.

The service was great.

Note this place will be freezing in winter as the space is small and when anyone enters or leaves a gust of cold air rushes into the small space."}
{"text":"So my friend has always loved vegan food and felt like vegan one day and I decided to tag along even though I'm not a huge fan of vegan food, but I'm glad I did. 

So we ordered the Quinoa Mac 'N Cheese to share and I ordered the Wahn Burger and my friend got the Japanese Curry Vegetable Bowl with Chick-un Nuggets mixed into it. The Quinao Mac 'N Cheese was pretty good, but I felt the more I ate it, the more I got sick of that vegan cheese flavour. Moving on to the Wahn Burger. So I previously had a bad experience at another vegan restaurant (I won't mention where) and I didn't like what I ordered so I was quite worried about the Wahn Burger. I can confidently say that I actually enjoyed it. The \"burger\" tasted really good and the fries complimented it very well. I was quite impressed that I actually enjoyed vegan food for once. My friend loved her Japanese Curry Vegetable Bowl and I got to try it as well, and it was really good! I think if I were to go back, I'd probably get that as the chick-un nuggets tastes like actually chicken! 

Overall, I was quite happy that I got to try this place out as I really enjoyed it. I would totally recommend everyone (vegan food lovers and people who don't like vegan food) to try this place out if you're in the area."}
{"text":"Oh me oh my ! 

Now I am no vegan or vegetarian however I have to commend this restaurant for its artistic flavours and amazing twists on the menu. 

Have you ever had sesame fries ? Yup neither did I before this place and let me just say, I don't know the recipe or the techniques, but I am dying to learn how to make those fries myself because they were just that good. 

I have never before had vegan chicken nuggets and let me just say how much this restaurant made the chicken nuggets so close to the texture and flavour of a real chicken nugget. 

You can definitely expect me back here one day , and maybe even trying more vegan restaurants. 

This journey has got me excited :)"}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped here for lunch after exploring Kensington Market. We both started off with juices, one pear and ginger, and one beet, apple and ginger. They both were delicious, even though they had no added sugar. The pear juice is a little easier to drink because it doesn't have that earthy flavor from the beets, but I liked both beverages.

I had the chik-un banh mi, and my husband had the pulled pork banh mi. I'm not sure why these sandwiches are called banh mi, since they're not like the Vietnamese sandwich at all. The chick-un had crispy vegan chicken, with tomatoes and lettuce and some sort of house sauce, and I was pleased with my sandwich. 

I tried a bit of my husband's pulled pork, and I hate to say it, but I didn't like it. I never had pulled pork before becoming a vegetarian, but I'm pretty sure it's not like the pulled pork here, all stringy and gummy, because I can't see how people would like it. 

It was our waitress' first day, and she was very attentive and friendly. If I lived in Toronto, I'd definitely make it a habit of coming here, though I'd stick with the chick-un if I wanted fake meat."}
{"text":"A bit disappointed! Grasshopper used to be my go-to for brunch, however, recent changes to the menu has me reconsidering whether I will come back. 

No longer are there sweet brunch items on the menu - my favorite being the wild blueberry chia seed pancakes. I was told this dish was taken off the menu because it created \"too much waste\", which yes, understandably it is hard to finish a five pancake meal, yet perhaps that's an indication the portion size is too big, not that it needs to be taken off the menu. 

The blueberry pancakes were replaced by another pancake dish, topped with a vegan version of pulled pork and hollandaise sauce, which was just alright. The pancakes were a bit undercooked and service was unwilling to provide a mutually beneficial solution to the underwhelming dish. If I had known this would be the case, I would have gone next door and gotten the real non-vegan deal."}
{"text":"Went for a quick night out to Grasshopper. This place is small! I think only 14 people can get 'proper' seating in here. Not sure if they have a back room or patio but the front side doesn't fit too many so I'm glad we got there early. We were the second people seated but by the time we left people were waiting for a seat.  The service I would say was normal or average. I did hear them be accommodating to the people waiting for seats. Food- Now the big stuff, we ordered the veggie burger and the mango-peanut butter made with almond milk smoothy. The veggie burger had excellent flavour and a good kick. It was a veggie burer, not one of those fake meat things. The smoothy was decent but nothing to write home about. Overall- You should have a good time going here. I probably won't come back as there nothing to draw me in for a return visit.
Parents note: No high chair."}
{"text":"Tasty vegetarian food and interesting dishes for the most part, not overly expensive, service not so great, and won't accept credit cards."}
{"text":"beet , apple and ginger juice is delicious and fairly priced

We had the rice balls and also the fried chick-un's. both were delicious.

Everyone enjoyed their meals (bahn mi's and salads.) 
I would recommend this place. It's like fresh with a smaller menu."}
{"text":"The Chick-un nuggets, and \"Pulled Pork\" sandwich were incredible. I am 100% in love with the creative seasoning and  generous portion sizing; the house dressing was also mouth watering; the first fully vegan meal I have had in years, and I am sold. 

Will be recommending and returning in the future."}
{"text":"This place is one more good place for vegetarian or vegans and has variety of options to try for from sandwiches to burgers. Noodles to rice
Bowls all made in organic way and tastes good too. We tried vegan pulled pork Banh mi and this juicy and was tasting really good. We also had miso vegetable bowl with sesame fries. They had made it from red rice and organic veggies with great home made sauce. Felt quantity was less but was tasting good."}
{"text":"An excellent little gem! I passed by with my friend for a late lunch this afternoon. I got tempted to try their banana matcha smoothie, which was a great delight. The miso vegetable bowl not only hit the spot but also satisfied my picky Asian tastebuds. Two thumbs up! PS. the peanut butter blondie is sinfully awesome!"}
{"text":"FOOD: The food was tasty, but I had a different expectation of their food. I should have looked at the menu ahead of time. Don't get me wrong. Many people will find the selection appealing, but it wasn't the case for me. I found the meal choices limited in terms of ingredients and variety. Fresh, for instance, offers a slightly better choice and variety IMHO. I'm not talking about the number of items on the menu. I'm talking about what goes into each meal. I wish their bowls were more reminiscent of Ethiopian food, which I personally enjoy.

Did I enjoy the food? I felt like burger+fries combo felt dry overall. I should have ordered a bowl instead. Would I be back? Hm...probably not. I'd rather check out a different vegan / vegetarian place.

SERVICE: Exceptional. The guys working there are super friendly and nice."}
{"text":"When your omnivore partner asks for a return visit you know you have a winner!

I ordered delivery from here awhile back and enjoyed the pulled \"pork\", forgetting there was no pork involved. The dessert was the worst part of the meal - it seemed store bought and kind of expensive for a cookie.

Since then, I've been to this location a few times because it's a perfect place to enjoy dinner with vegan friends. We enjoy the food and nobody feels limited.

My husband LOVES the fries and so do I. It's surprising how many vegan places get fried potatoes wrong (Doomies, Fresh). They are crispy, perfectly cooked and fresh.

This place is on rotation even though we're not vegan"}
{"text":"The apps (unchicken nuggets and rice balls were very good). The sloppy Joe Tempeh was also good."}
{"text":"Great to see another vegan-friendly restaurant in the city! 

I've eaten here a few times now. Everything is quite flavorful, so if you have any taste aversions, be warned, they typically aren't subtle in their flavours. For instance, I'm not a huge fan of sesame - and their fries are loaded with it. My guest loved them, so to each their own.

Kale salad is awesome - well shredded and massaged, so easy to eat. The dressing is garlic-rich, which I loved. 

Try to the portabella burger stuffed with 'cheese'"}
{"text":"After a disappointing day in Toronto, this was a welcome refresher before embarking on a trip to the harbourfront to attend a concert. The staff was friendly and welcoming, the wait was reasonable, and the food was worth the price. Our dishes were excellent and well-flavoured. Vegan and vegetarian is sometimes hit and miss but here it is right on the mark.

It also seemed that we arrived in the nick of time; the intimate space filled to capacity soon after we received or meals. This was no rush for us, however, and we left very happy with the experience and invigorated for the evening."}
{"text":"Got the miso bowl and it was so salty! Definitely way over my daily allowance of sodium. The portion was decent and you will definitely be full after. My friend got the \"pulled pork\" burger and she said it was way too tough and hard to chew. Overall I don't think I will be back because there are a lot of other good options in the area."}
{"text":"First time here really good food! Very small at the College location, only a few tables so expect a wait. Enjoyed the spicy black bean burger and the rice poppers were delicious ! Only thing I would avoid would be dessert - the brownie and the blondie were so bland and gross. They should make black bean brownies instead! Overall would come back again."}
{"text":"Ahhh--mazing! The ambiance was super cool and filled with aromatic fragrances from the variety of sauces. I ordered the black bean burger with sesame fries. The burger tastes good but it was little on the dry side. They have generous portions of fries which I couldn't finish. Overall, it's an awesome vegan place and I would keep coming back to try other stuff."}
{"text":"Purposely made our way to the junction to go to a different restaurant and decided to stop in here instead due to their appealing special on the sidewalk board.

Came for brunch on a Sunday at 1300 and got in just before the rush of people with no line up. Great friendly service in a cute artsy location. Great place for my partner who doesn't enjoy breakfast/brunch because he can't have eggs.

I settled on the breakfast bowl and it was huge. My partner kept saying, \"you won't finish that!\" Quinoa, scrambled tofu, red onions avocados and roasted sweet peppers. It was very filling and super delicious. He chose the chick-un and waffles which was also delicious and filling(he had leftovers). The \"chicken\" was a protein called Satan that was breaded with quinoa and surprisingly had very similar texture to chicken with a nice crunch to each bite. The waffles were made with a nice touch of basil and organo.  Great atmosphere and delicious food would recommend it to vegans and non-vegans alike."}
{"text":"Went here around December and I really enjoyed the food! I am not a vegan or vegetarian but I still enjoyed it very much.

The place is quite small, very dim so it was hard to see and it was empty when we went. But the interior was nice - it was simple and chic, and had a rustic feel to it.

I had the \"Chick-un\" Banh mi (or whatever) and it actually TASTES LIKE REAL CHICKEN! Its softer and not as crunchy as a regular chicken filet but it still tastes good. My friend, who is vegetarian, had the pulled pork sandwich and she really enjoyed it as well! I was surprised that it wasn't real meat.

I am definitely coming back! Maybe earlier so that there's more light and everything would be easier to see aha"}
{"text":"Grasshopper does vegetarian/vegan comfort food.  We ordered a chick-un banh mi, \"pulled pork\" bahn mi, and the burger platter (with a classic beefy patty).  When the food arrived, I was amazed at how similar the \"meats\" looked like the real thing, especially the pulled pork.  The pulled pork, was tossed in a very delicious bbq sauce.  Texture wise, it was a bit chewy, not so melt in your mouth or tender as like the real thing.  But texture of 'fake meat' can never be exactly like real meat anyways.  Never expect the texture to be the same, or else you will just be disappointed! My chick-un I really enjoyed.  Crispy crunchy on the outside, and firm on the inside, almost like the texture of chicken breast, almost. I think the most disappointing one out of the bunch was the burger with the classic beef patty.  I've never really enjoyed vegetarian burgers.  Just never had a good one where the patty was supposed to mimic real meat.  I do enjoy the patties that are made from beans or grains though.  The hubby also mentioned that his burger was doused too heavily with bbq sauce. 
Each of our dishes came with either a spring salad, kale salad or sesame fries.  I chose the kale salad, which was kale chopped down, and tossed in a gingery lemony dressing.  The sesame fries were French fries tossed with ground up sesame seeds.  Very delicious, gave the fries a very nice flavour."}
{"text":"I want to get excited about this place but I cant. I started with the vegan chicken wings, which weren't bad, but nothing to get excited about. They were kind of soft and not really chicken-like. I also went with the quinoa mac and cheese, which the server seemed to recommend to everyone in the restaurant but I didn't like it at all. It wasn't poorly prepared and the sauce had a good texture, it just tasted nothing like mac and cheese and that's what I wanted to eat. The service was friendly and it's possible everything else on the menu is delicious so I may give them another shot."}
{"text":"Mac and cheese with pulled pork was great. Also got the kimchi fries and they were great! Only complaint I had was that they don't take American debit cards (even it being TD). I guess their machine won't allow it, We had to pull cash out of an atm downstairs but it wasn't a big deal. Besides that, everything was good!"}
{"text":"I like this place because its covers both ends on the vegan food spectrum; offering both deep fried fake meat, and healthful salads and juices. You can stay completely on either side, or pick from both, as I am generally want to do. 

For my first visit with two of my lady pals, I had the chick-un bahn mi, which I really enjoyed. The fake chicken had a great texture and flavour, and the baguette it came on was equally delicious. They haven't updated their online menu to reflect the sandwich toppings in house, but I'm sure both versions are equally good, if not a little different. Tempted by the smell of them wafting out of the kitchen, I opted for a side of fries over salad or soup, which I don't regret because they are excellent.

In an attempt to balance out my meal, I opted for the fresh beet, apple, and ginger juice. With no added sugar it was a refreshing compliment to my dinner. 

I don't know what got into me because I rarely order desserts, but the carrot cake was calling my name, and when I learned it doesn't have raisins in it (which I feel strongly it never should) I answered. It was also delicious. Super moist and with a tangy sweet cream \"cheese\" frosting. 

Overall my experience at Grasshopper was solid and it gets extra points for a full meal + juice + dessert coming in at under $30 before tip."}
{"text":"We have walked past the place a couple of times and been curious about their selection. It is a long narrow restaurant located on the north side of the street with windows looking south. A selection of tables for two with banquette seating along one wall runs along one side of the place. Facing that is a bar with single chairs. At the back is the cash and kitchen. The place has a subtle funky feel with wood boards, a deep green colour and some beautiful lighting made out of old pickle jars. While the menu is limited to a selection of bowls, and vegan sandwiches there was enough to be interesting. We had the daily soup and the vegetarian burger and sesame fries. The soup and the burger were delicious. The fries were a great idea, french fries dressed with sesame oil, but the oil made them too soggy. They would be better dressed with sesame seeds, some dried garlic and parsley and sea salt. It would also be nice to see sweet potato fries on the menu. The place is serving a similar menu to the more established Fresh, but with a plucky upstart vibe that is certainly more friendly and less noisy. We need to return."}
{"text":"This is a small but busy place. On Sat the service was a bit slow as they had just two servers. Recommend reservations. 

The decor is eclectic and dimly lit. We found the place drafty.

We had the \"Chick-Un\" burger, the mushroom rice bowl and the mac & cheese. The food was unbelievable!  Esp the chicken nuggets. 

Parking is tight around this space."}
{"text":"I was finally able to eat here with my mom and she (and myself) was beyond happy! Everything we ordered were delicious and so flavourful. You forget that any of these are vegan. We had the Japanese style curry  which was super authentic (then we found out all the chefs were Japanese) and the pulled \"pork\" sandwich had the perfect BBQ flavour, again you forget that it's vegan. The daily soup, pumpkin leek I believe, had the perfect amount of seasoning that was far from bland. The amount was generous for a \"side\" soup!

Dessert we tried the home made vegan tiramisu with cashew cheese. Clearly this was the most popular. We were lucky to devour the last piece! 

My mom was so happy she wants to go back again and try everything else on the menu. Highly recommend the curry and tiramisu"}
{"text":"I think the food and the service could be better but it's popular.  To be honest we need more plant based restaurants in our fair city so that there are more choices.  I felt discriminated against during visit because people who came after me were seated before.  I am an old woman and was there on my own.  I guess they thought I didn't need a table as much as the others.  I don't really know but when I mentioned it the staff were quite rude and argumentative/defensive.  Handled poorly unfortunately.  Ended up with take out on that visit and it was my first time having the chick-un burger.  not that palatable to get a giant piece of \"chickun\" stuck in a bun.  Others here on yelp show pictures of a chickun sandwich that is in a different bun and cut in half.  Neither of these pictures look like what I received in my take out bag without nary an apology or have a nice day.  They didn't even say thank you.  So I have certainly experienced better manners and more professional service.  It deserves more than a 1 but I surely can't give it an A-OK at all.  So a two it is."}
{"text":"Started with a delicious Detox Smoothie, had the \"beef\" satay as an appie (yum) and had the \"pulled pork\" sammie, just cuz I was curious. I was pleasantly surprised and would recommend it to those who have a) never had a pulled pork sandwich b) used to be a meat eater who is now a vegetarian. I would totally go back to try other things off the menu!"}
{"text":"Cozy little restaurant with good food and a nice atmosphere. My girlfriend and I went for lunch with her family and we all left satisfied. As a meat-eater, vegetarian food usually leaves something to be desired however this was definitely not the case! 

We had the chick-un nuggets as a starter. The texture was quite nice and compared favorably to chicken breast. Slightly more seasoning in the \"meat\" would have made the dish perfect. We shared a vegetarian beef banh mi and a pulled pork banh mi and both were tasty. Neither dish was what you would call \"authentic\" but were flavourful nonetheless. The beef reminded me a little of beef jerky and had good flavour. Both dishes were served with a large portion of sesame fries which were very tasty."}
{"text":"Great vegan food at affordable prices! Very cute atmosphere and helpful staff make the experience one to remember! Lots of flavourful options!"}
{"text":"I hardly ever order a salad when I'm eating out. They're usually boring and uninspired. Also, I can make a really good one for really cheap. Their haru salad, however, changed my mind. Weird lettuces, chickpeas, kidney beans, julienne of daikon and cucumber, and shaved gobo (burdock). I got mine with house dressing (I found the plum dressing way too sweet) and with an order of breaded tofu. 

It was not only satisfying and filling, but also very tasty. Without the tofu, I would have had a bit of room for dessert but with it, I was quite full. 

The service is inviting and friendly. That said, I think one of the servers is still getting his sea legs. When we asked about what the house dressing is, he described it as an oil and vinegar situation. It might well have been oil and vinegar but it was so much more. Garlic was wafting up from it. There was miso in there. There must have been sesame oil (but I could be mistaken). When I also which of the dressings is not sweet he suggested the plum instead of the house. The plum was a sweet plum dressing. Oops. 

For food that is so carefully crafted, special, and delicious, it seems a shame that the waiter didn't know more about the food. That said, the food speaks for itself. Even if the poor waiter didn't know how to describe what was coming, he was still attentive and a sweetheart. 

Excellent place to bring your friends and enjoy a meal together. There's something for everyone."}
{"text":"Be warned: they do NOT accept credit cards. Only cash and debit. Toronto being an international city, Grasshopper needs to get updated to the 21st century.

I did NOT dine here because who uses cash nowadays? Quite disappointed. Wish I knew this before trekking 30 minutes in the rain to get here."}
{"text":"Service food and atmosphere was spot on! Great place to go and chill alone or with a group! Had some chili to start, was delicious! And then a burger to follow with a salad, and lettuce buns instead of actual bread buns! Everything was super tasty, the homemade vegan sauce option with the burger I would recommend, and salad dressing so yummy! Wish my tummy was bottomless so I coulda had desert too!"}
{"text":"I'm a card carrying vegetarian; that's right, we have meetings and you're not invited. Except you, Tanya, we just received your application. Anyway, I checked out Grasshopper with a friend on a weekday night and had myself a fantastic meal. I had the rice poppers as an app which were unequivocally delicious, I couldn't recommend them more highly. As a main I had the Japanese curry which was hearty and tasty. The alcohol options are a bit limited but I liked the cranberry ale I had. Service was excellent. This is a great, cozy place and could be a really good choice for a date or a small intimate dinner with a couple of friends. Looking forward to eating here again...most likely with Tanya."}
