{"text":"When I'm not feeling adventurous (read: when i'm lazy), I like to order delivery from Pearl City. Even though i fall out of their \"delivery\" zone by 3 traffic lights, they still deliver to me without issue.

Their food is tasty, their prices are reasonable and their delivery service is great. I've eaten in the restaurant a half dozen times and the staff and service is good as well.

Their crispy beef is pretty decent as well, their portions are great for most dishes I've tried."}
{"text":"Pearl City offers a number of classic Chinese Canadian dishes done well, and always with friendly service. Every time I go for take-out I'm offered tea. They offer a discount for cash orders. The restaurant is always clean and comfortable--a quite respite from the traffic outside on Yonge Street.

Under new management."}
{"text":"This place, I was really hoping it would be good or even acceptable for that matter, but to my dismay it was disappointing to say the least...

When I found out that it was under new management from Jim G's quick tip I decided to give this place another try. Assuming the new people who took over would change the food a bit... 

I called and they didn't have much to say, other then the fact that the food is the same, so there goes hoping for a change...

The sweet and sour sauce is very very strange, not your average Canadian sauce that you would find at your typical restaurant but the original owner was from England and didn't see a problem with it. I guess that is the interpretation of sweet and sour in England? It was very runny, dark and actually sour... Whereas normal sweet and sour sauce is made with ketchup being the main ingredient..

Its honestly too bad, I was hoping  this would work out... It ends at the homemade plum sauce and egg rolls for me."}
{"text":"I am a fan of Chinese food, well basically any food that's good. I am very pick and judgemental when it comes to presentation, taste and accuracy(how well its cooked or prepared). I strongly believe that if you want to sell a product or have it considered by others then you should make an effort or have a passion for what you are doing. 

       My friend recommended it to me if i was ever in the area, with two thumbs up. I checked it out a few days ago on a weekday. I was a little skeptical about the place since it did have 2 stars out of 5 on this site but i trust a friend's review more than i do other people so i went for it. My first impression was, if you walk from the subway and you go down on the west side of yonge then the sign is a bit small. I got that impression cuz everyone else has huge signs. However from the side or if you are on the other side of the street, then its not a problem and its visible(as seen in the picture). When i walked in the place, it was very spacious and did not feel cluster-phobic like other small restaurant/ take-out places. The staff was very welcoming and i did not feel ignored or neglected at any point. I sat at the table and right away they gave me hot tea and a menu to look at, they did let me know its a new management and explained how the menu is similar to the old menu but will be revisited around new years. I started with spring rolls and they provided 2 sauses for me since i couldn't decide between sweet and spicy or plum sauce. The sauces were good, but nothing special. Spring rolls did not let me down however, they were well prepared, nicely put together on the plate rather than just thrown on the plate and cutting them in half like i usually get most places.
       When the main course came i was surprised and happy to see it. First off, it was out at a good time, didn't take very long and very well presented. The chicken was perfectly cooked, and looked very fresh, none of that frozen shit people use that tastes like cardboard. The sauce for the chicken was to die for, i felt like i should have waited cuz i ate the spring-rolls with the other sauce but it would have been even better with the lemon chicken sauce, I will have to get the recipie for it next time i go.  Anyways i got a side of stir-fried rice with that, i found the quantities were perfect because i did finish both plates at the same time. The rice was great and went well with the chicken. I did talk to one of the girls working there and it was her parents in the back doing the cooking. At one point the mother came out and was very nice and pleasant even tho she didn't speak English very well.
          In the end, I respect family owned restaurants, i feel like they want to provide something else, more like home style food you'd eat at home or friends house rather than the same old conveyor belt type foods people spit out for a quick buck. I give it 5 out of 5 and even tho im not a person to review places except to friends and family i felt that this place was worth much more than just 2 stars. If im in the area i will sure to be visiting the place again and i have gave a good feed back to my friends as well."}
