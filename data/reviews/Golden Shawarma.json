{"text":"The owner is v.friendly. Taste of food average. We took chicken shawrma platter. Portion of chicken was too small in it & owner forgot to add pita. So the point is check your order if you want to take away."}
{"text":"Walked in on a Friday night, the shawarma is really good, chicken has a lot of spices and tastes really authentic. Turns out the place is under new management, overall a big fan!"}
{"text":"This place is a very average place. The shawarma is pretty good, nothing special but tasty and they didn't skimp on the meat or fillings.  Price is average at $5.50 - $6.00 for a shawarma sandwich, and around $8.50 for a plate.  The menu is pretty limited but they have all the standard grilled stuff.  This is a take out place with a few stools and counters to sit at to eat.  I wouldn't travel out of my way to eat here, but if you're in the neighbourhood and feel like shawarma or kebab, it's an alright place.  They have a sign saying the food is Halal."}
{"text":"Ordered 2 chicken dinners and a falafel sandwich. We started with the falafel sandwich which was made to order and was delicious, it had a nice crunch and was very flavorful. After having just moved into the area, we thought this was going to be our go to shwarma place, we were wrong. The chicken was dried out as if it had been sitting out all day. We should have realized when the spits of both the chicken and beef were not spinning that it was downhill from there. And judging from the congealed fat on the beef visible from where we were standing, the spits weren't even heating the meat. The rice was forgettable and the side salad had no flavor as there was no dressing whatsoever.  Had I not tried the falafel sandwich I would have given this place 0 stars if I could.  I won't be going back there any time soon."}
{"text":"Looks like this place is closed. Too bad, I really enjoyed their Shawarmas.. and who doesn't like daily specials!"}
{"text":"Place is tiny - I wouldn't recommend sitting in and eating as there's no actual AC - just a big fan-like structure by the fridge. If there are more than 4 people inside - moving around is not an option. BUT the food was delicious. Not the best shawarma I've ever had, but you have the option of beef/chicken/mix. DON'T GET FRIES! Please. Take my advice. They're bellow mediocre, you could do way better without them. I got hummus, lettuce, tomato, pickled beets hot sauce and I think ranch? It was pretty big too! For a wrap, fries and can of pop I paid around 9 bucks. Not that cheap!!"}
