{"text":"This is a new offshoot of Paramount Fine Foods. Paramount seems like they are trying to enter the healthy fast food business.  At its' core it is basically a Subway or Mr Sub, they bake their own bread and give you a choice of meat and toppings.   The things that make FreshEast different is the incorporation of middle eastern elements and the fact it is halal. They offer all the meats in your choice of a bun or wrap. You have Middle Eastern options of hummus, falafel, chicken shawarma meat, baklava, tahini sauce, Zatar sauce and fattoush salad.  There were two people working, one in the back and one in the front, the girl in the front was doing cash and making sandwiches so it took a while, but she was always file gently changing gloves.  I ordered a Shish Taouk wrap with a fountain drink and chips. The chicken seems to be refrigerated like Subway and I would guess the chicken shawarma is the same, I am not sure if they heat it. They also were out of hot sauce.  The pace and methodology that she worked seemed to reflected the fact she was carefully trained. For instance, the quantity of chicken was not much, however, it just enough to have a piece of chicken in each bite, so it seems that is what FreshEast is aiming for in terms of quantity.  I got the fountain drink and chips for 2.49, which is expensive considering a the cup held as much as a pop can. Fountain drink only is $1.39.  Conclusion: Wrap was decent but nothing to rave about service was good for one person but too long. Food is expensive, I was still hungry after spending $9.20, maybe I shoulda got a sub instead. I would recommend this place to people who must eat halal and are looking for Subway alternative."}
{"text":"Had their roast beef sub for lunch and got a terrible upset stomach. Either it was undercooked or it wasn't stored adequately for a hot day. It sucks because I was really excited to find this place."}
{"text":"Good food, but bad service. They have so much special offers advertised in th store and in the flyers, and when you ask for it they say we dont have it! \"Sorry its not there!\"  Well if its not there then why would you offer it! They put it to trick customer! Its so eligible!"}
{"text":"This is a fast food spin off from Paramount Fine Foods restaurant.   The whole concept is a bit confusing, as it is essentially like Subway, but with a Middle Eastern twist, which includes halah meats, sauces(tahini saucce, hummus, zaatar sauce, and fattoush), and baklava.   My first visit, I came here craving shawarma. Sadly, they ran out of shawarma meat, pretty disappointing given this is a Middle Eastern joint. Luckily, during my recent visit, they actually had shawarmas. BUT, the meat was cold, and was not sliced on the rotating cone, there wasn't picked vegetables, or garlic mayo. All the components that make a good shawarma, in my opinion, was missing.   Overall verdict: Rather go to Ali Baba's down the street for some more authentic shawarma."}
{"text":"Yes this is Paramount lite which is not a good thing because the full version is not much to write home about. My guess is they were offered a sweetheart deal by EMTC leasing because they already have a full Paramount store on in the parking lot area beside Eglinton."}
{"text":"Went on Sunday and they said their location is discontinuing subs.  Yet the tv above showed subs.. at least turn the TV off so that no one thinks you're still selling it."}
