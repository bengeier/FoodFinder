{"text":"Espresso was cold like the waitress. They prepare Middle Eastern food, I thought they would serve REAL coffee."}
{"text":"Formerly Cafe Volare, same staff. Not sure why the name changed - many items on the Cafe Volare menu are on Mia Bella's. I order either the classic burger or chicken strips. 

The burger comes on a rectangular focaccia type bread. Comes dry, with cheese, lettuce, tomato. Its freshly made.  Its also large enough I can eat half for lunch, the rest for dinner. 

Chicken fingers are frozen. You can tell. But when I want \"bar food\" for lunch its fine by me. 

I once made the mistake of ordering a meatball sandwich. Sauce not served on it. Meatballs were dry, fell apart & were gritty looking. I was physically ill after a few bites. It was obvious the meatballs were old.  

My office is a 6 minute walk & not easy to access. I could easily walk down to their place but it is summer & there is not a minimum delivery order.  Vinny usual brings me my lunch order & I tip him well. He takes care of my lunch needs, sometimes making several trips back & forth to make sure I have what I need.  

Nice change from all the fast food in the area. Skinny Fats is further down Dean Martin but their delivery fee varies & can be as high as $10 on a $30 bill & they take FOREVER!!!  Mia Bella has free delivery. Its not the best place ever, but I like it. Often I forget to eat/order lunch & when I do remember, I'm starving with the hunger headache setting in, I order here. Quick, fast, friendly...I have no complaints (except for the meatball sammie)."}
{"text":"This place has undergone quite the string of facelifts and owners, over the past ten years, from Josette's Bakery, to Normandie Cafe, to Cafe Volare, and now we present Mia Bella! It is certainly the most-inventive of all the menus among its predecessors. The restaurant is frequented mainly by local business, because of its off-the-beaten-path location. I like coming here for a quick, freshly-prepared meal (breakfast or lunch) and a double espresso. They offer some good daily specials of both the Mediterranean and Italian flare. I like the falafel. I usually order a side if them with my salad. The hummus is also creamy, but not runny. I like what they've done with the nice mix of cuisine. Mia Bella will keep me coming back. My mixed Shawarma Plate, Lentil Soup, and espresso came to $23 + tip. The portions were ample, so I'm not headed back to work hungry! PS-for some reason, the Yelp listing shows it as \"closed\" today. Not! Check the website for hours."}
{"text":"Great customer service

My schwarma was too salty for my taste and without a question they comped it even though I insisted on paying."}
{"text":"Down the block from my office, this restaurant is beautiful and convenient for business lunches. I've ate here many times and simply fell in love - specifically with their shawarma and pastas. Great prices, great atmosphere,  great staff - what more can you ask for?"}
{"text":"Great food ,excellent service. Overall awesome food experience
I ordered the shawarma wrap it was delicious and reasonably priced. Defiantly coming back again."}
{"text":"If there was an option to give negative stars this place absolutely deserves it. Staff not friendly,food horrible, and over priced. Order an Italian panini, hardly any meat and came with nothing on it. Not to mention they charged $12.95 for the sandwich and a drink. Never go here. I will tell everyone I see."}
{"text":"The food was delicious but the owners,servers had bad attitudes. it felt like it was too much trouble to ask for extra sauces, refills etc. Someone came in for a refund on their watery coffee & she was given the 3rd degree. Terrible customer service. I have eaten here 2x never again."}
{"text":"This place is right down the street from my office and me and my office co-workers go here EVERY DAY. The wonderful lady behind the counter is a gem and is always bright and happy even when it is crazy busy in the restaurant. They have such a wide variety that we have ordered different items and been pleased with each and every one including the raviolis, spicy chicken tenders, and cheeseburgers. Highly recommend to everyone."}
{"text":"I am on a business trip in Vegas and stopped this morning for breakfast at Mia Bella Caf√©. the food was delicious, great price and the staff were very friendly so I had to come back for lunch before I leave to NY.I specially loved the Kebab . it was Prefect ! crispy from the outside  Juicy and moist from the inside full of flavour. I will definitely come back again !!!"}
{"text":"A great hidden gem just of the strip. Great Mediterranean cafe with friendly service and fair price. Save your money and get off the strip."}
{"text":"Best falafel in Las Vegas!  So fresh, so flavorful, so delicious!   Large portion, low price sandwich/side special daily!   I think about this sandwich and have to go get one!"}
{"text":"They got 3 out 4 of my items wrong and when i called to tell them that i got yelled at by one of the employees never ordering from here again."}
{"text":"I was at Rebath on Valley View yesterday with a friend and we decided to stop in Mia Bella for lunch.  We were the only ones there at first and service was fine.  They serve Italian and Mediterranean food.  They brought a plate of grilled beets to the table.  I thought they could have been grilled more but I'm not a beet fan anyway so it didn't matter.  I ordered the grilled chicken wrap which had hummus and tomato in it on a plain wrap.  It also came with cucumber which I had them leave out.  It was very tasty although I would have liked a spinich wrap but there wasn't an option.  There was also a choice of sides and we both got the rosemary roasted potatoes which were great!  Prices were very reasonable too, for two sandwiches with sides and an ice tea, it came to $21 with tax.  Unfortunately, we don't live or work anywhere near there so the chances of ever going back are next to nil.  But if you are close or visiting the Strip, I would recommend it."}
{"text":"Shwarma! YUMMMMMMMMMMMMMM! Very clean, friendly and delicious food! A lot of options. Love the mix of Italian and Medit food!"}
{"text":"Wow amazing food and amazing service. We've been ordering from this restaurant for a while now! The new owner is so friendly and always makes sure to always take great care of us. Highly recommend this restaurant! You won't be disappointed"}
{"text":"Have been in the neighborhood for 10 years and never thought of stopping to eat at this location always on the go very busy but one day I took the time to stop and it was worth the time food was very good"}
{"text":"Shawarma and rosemary potatoes is all I can review, because that's all I ever order: it is that good!"}
{"text":"With a name like Mia Bella, I was expecting an Italian-heavy menu of pizzas and pastas. While there are a few pasta dishes (like the spaghetti and meatball lunch special), the ownership and kitchen strengths are Mediterranean. 

FALAFEL PITA LUNCH ($6): Pita arrived packed with several (6?) fresh-made falafel balls and tomato-cucumber salad. The falafel were crunchy on the outside, soft and flavorful on the inside. Wrap is served with a side of fries and two squirt-bottles of tahini and a spicy green sauce to kick up your pita. Light and tasty, would get this again.
SPAGHETTI LUNCH: This is a three-course monster meal, starting with an incredible lentil soup with a side of fresh, chewy bread, then continuing with a massive bowl of spaghetti and meatballs. The spaghetti and sauce were decent, but the meatballs themselves tasted odd, as if they were mostly breadcrumb or filler, though they didn't look it. Unsure what meat is used in these balls, did not care for them. The dessert was a panacotta-like yogurt topped with nuts and sided with rose water, oddly reminiscent of an Indian dish but quite tasty.

Service was attentive and polite. Space is larger than the exterior suggests, with two dining rooms and covered patio seating. No drink fountain, but coffee and bottled beverages available in a refrigerator. 

NOTE: this spot is only open weekdays, and closes early at 6PM. If you plan to stop in, make sure it's early."}
{"text":"This place is great I went there today for the first time I ordered the falafel Sandwich baklava and the lentil soup. I was really good fresh and fast too. I did ask for wine and the gentleman said they didn't have it yet, but I'm sure next time I go they will.
Loved it!"}
{"text":"Where do I start? I order from Mia Bella Cafe at least once a week. Their homemade soups are delicious. I am a huge fan of their paninis, specifically the Panino Giardinara, my boss is a fan of the Panino Bistecca.

The staff is so incredibly sweet, they treat you like part of the family! They all know me by name. I always ask for delivery and it's always delivered in a timely manner. 

When I don't bring a lunch Mia Bella Cafe is my #1 choice! Keep up the good work and amazing quality food!"}
{"text":"I should have posted this one months ago but I was feeling kinda selfish, wanting to keep this place a secret among friends. But I have to spread the word: this place has good food all around and the service is always welcoming but it's the Grilled Chicken Panino sandwich that is easily the BEST in Vegas. Don't miss it. Come by here often. Spend lots of money. These hard-workin' folks deserve it."}
{"text":"nice place to go have lunch on a lunch break. I had the shawarma pita. Nice atmosphere. Feels very chill and laid back."}
{"text":"Having the falafel pita lunch special!  The owner even brought me over a complimentary cup of broccoli soup.  Delish!  Everything is so fresh.  Fries were good and fresh too...."}
{"text":"Sorry, little grey heads, Mia Bella Cafe is just Meh for me and not the 5-star experience that everyone else seemed to enjoy (did you?). Came in around 11:15am and the spot was empty. Like, 0 people in there. 0. I was aiming for a light meal, but there were signs for shawarma outside and I'm weak for the stuff, so I went for a shawarma wrap with a side of potato salad and then grabbed a turkey panini to eat later in the day. 

I'll make this quick bc it's Friday and I know you gots some partying to do... the wrap wasn't cut, so I had a shawarma burrito that was eh. I was confused the entire time on whether it was OK or not. The potato salad consisted of diced potatoes, but no mayo to tie 'em together. So, yea, just a bunch of dry potatoes. The panini was OK. Turkey, cheese, let, tom on some nice bread.... but they put it in a box with an Israeli salad which leaked all over it, making the bread soggy as hell and an open-faced panini for moi. Overall, meh. I wouldn't return."}
{"text":"The food was below average no flavor I had the falafel wrap the portion is generous but it lacked a key ingredient the authentic tahini sauce and some hummed overall authenticity was missing the falafel it self had no flavor"}
{"text":"I had the lunch special falafel with fries.
After eating I had an espresso .
Parking was FULL . But I parked on the street and walked.
Service friendly and quick. It was a hot day and felt hot inside the cafe initially . Somewhere near the end of my dining the air conditioner seemed to kick on.
Falafel was delicious and the green sauce they brought to the table as an option was very spicy . A little goes a long way.
Unfortunately the fries were a little cold, but it didn't ruin my experience.
I would come back again . I probably would stick to the specials as they are a great value."}
{"text":"This is a quaint little breakfast and lunch restaurant close to the strip. They just happen to be mediterranean... the Pesto Mozzarella Panini is awesome...  Try it.. they are turning into an amazing little breakfast place.. a real hole-in-the-wall... 
-John"}
{"text":"Took my puppy to day care and found this place across from my dogs day care and thought I would give it a try. I ordered the burger with fries and a bagel. First off amazing service and very friendly owners. Secondly the taste was so refreshing. The meat they use is quality and fresh. Grass fed taste. The price for the taste is great. I got a lunch special for 4.99 you can't find that any where for what you are getting. I highly recommend."}
{"text":"I walked into this place since I had never been there, it was pretty empty.  I ordered the hamburger special and I literally had to wait 45 min for my food.  Everyone else had been served before and after me.  I walked out since I didnt have time to eat.   Wont ever go there again.  This is a late post as I was there one week ago 5-12-17"}
{"text":"I ordered the ham and eggs and instead of receiving a ham steak or its equivalent, I received 2 slices of packaged deli slice ham that was most likely Oscar Meyer quality. Espresso was cold !"}
{"text":"I have been a regular for over 3 years, eating lunch at least twice a week.  Fresh lentil soup, pasta e faggioli, homemade lasagna with a creamy bechamel, and chicken picatta, all have been delicious examples of lunches which reminded me of what my mom used to make. I LOVED this place and considered myself so fortunate to have such a gem close to work.  All this changed recently as they sold to new owners/partners and changed the menu to include middle eastern dishes like schwarma and falafel.  It wouldn't have bothered me so much, but the quality has declined dramatically and the prices have gone up.. Gone is my delicious spaghetti bolognese for $7.99, replaced with weird spices and overcooked chicken for $13.99. What is supposed to be hummus is some type of drywall putty. I mourn my old Cafe Volare as they now call it Mia Bella. I am so sad. I will never set foot in this place again and predict that it will shut down within 6 months. It breaks my heart. The new owners should give a course on \"how to take a fabulous business and run it into the ground\"."}
{"text":"They messed my order up then argued with me about what I wanted to order cause I wanted a double cheese burger I'm sorry if I want to be a fat ass and I'm using my money to do so then  leave me alone and just add the burger that I ask for couldn't believe all that over another piece of meat"}
{"text":"This is honestly the BEST Mediterranean restaurant I have ever been to. The service is always incredible, but the food is another thing. I don't know where they get their chefs, but their food is a must try for any foodie lover. I love their chicken kabobs, baba ganoush, and their fresh baked pastries, but lastly the restaurant is family owned! The owner is so friendly, and the rest of their staff always treat me like family whenever I enter. Thank you for your excellent restaurant!"}
{"text":"I used to love going here but I've recently noticed that there is new management.. And they aren't the nicest. I've had rude responses by the guy working the front multiple times. Good food - bad service."}
{"text":"Very good restaurant... I really enjoyed the flavor and taste of the chicken shawarma.  I also enjoyed the fresh humus and pita.  I would recommend!"}
{"text":"The food here is good! The owner and her son are so sweet. I order breakfast and lunch here sometimes. They have a frequent buyer's card and if you buy 9 meals the tenth is on them. Check out the hot green sauce. It's spicy but so good. I wish you didn't have to spend $10 to use a debit card but I understand."}
{"text":"I've been here many times because I work around the corner. I've only gotten a salad or the California Pizza, which is soooooooooo good! But today I ordered just a Mediterranean salad($10-12) and chicken ($3.50? I think. They don't have any fountain drinks, just a fridge with sodas, water and tea. Not a problem though, just the are like $2 I think.

All I ordered was the salad for takeout and it literally took 20 minutes. I sat outside enjoying the sun, but it felt a like a bit of a wait for just a salad and chicken! Regardless of the time the food was still great!"}
{"text":"Excellent food with normal prices . Not the inflated Vegas price.  Actually fed two people for under 20$
But this is a great spot for quick easy breakfast or lunch . I had basic breakfast and the pancakes where excellent."}
{"text":"On our last day in Vegas for our honeymoon we were fortunate enough to run into this gem. The food was A M A Z I N G. Lucky for us it wasn't too busy. We each ordered chicken kabob, which came with cucumber salad,rice and grilled chicken. HUGE PORTIONS worth the buck! So much flavor, not too salty, and felt like it was freshly made. We had a \"e-certificate\" that decided to give us problems and as we were trying to figure it out the owner of the restaurant came up to us and asked us how she can help. We explained what was going on and she said \"...don't worry...I'll tell you what...it's on the house!\" I mean, wow!!! Not only the food was great but we couldn't have asked for better service! Perfect way to end our trip as newlyweds! We'll definitely be back!"}
