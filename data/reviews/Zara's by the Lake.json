{"text":"Definitely the worst Middle Eastern food I've ever had - yes even worse than my Paramount review.   Our party of four ordered non-alcoholic drinks and some apps to start - baba ganoush and hummus bowls of less than a cup each both drowning in oil and served with a one very small chopped up pita. We also ordered fried calamari, which shockingly reminded us of the cheap battered rings you get at the supermarket.      Two of us then ordered the falafel platter which were overcooked, as hard as a golf balls and completely inedible. The other two ordered the pineapple chicken platter which also was overdone and unimpressive. Each platter came with either fries or rice and salad. The rice was standard Uncle Ben's and the fries similar to those you get in a school cafeteria. The salad consisted of iceberg lettuce and unripe tomatoes soaked in vinegar. Everything went back unfinished. More shocking was that all of this inedible garbage cost an unbelievable $140.     Everything we ate was extremely salty, and probably MSG-laden, so we asked for more water at the end of the meal. Our waitress was very obliging and brought us the water though we noticed the restaurant owner didn't look too pleased as it was almost closing time. Shortly afterwards one of the water glasses (a generic beer logo kind that restaurants typically get for free) accidentally broke when being pulled off the very sticky table we were sitting at - sticky because it wasn't cleaned properly before we arrived. The owner rushed over like a bat out of hell, and instead of apologizing or replacing the glass he angrily snatching the remaining glasses off the table saying, \"I'm just gonna clear these so you don't do any more damage!\"    To make things worse, the aftereffects of the meal stayed with us days later in the form of some terrible indigestion. Definitely a stomach churning experience we'd like others to avoid."}
{"text":"One of the best Mediterranean meal's we've had in a long time!  The service was also exceptional! :) We will be going back soon!"}
{"text":"Ordered sea food special for two $55. Below avg taste, frozen telapia fish and tiny portions. We are a couple and we went there with a couple of friends which they ordered Kafta plate. They were extremely disappointed as well. Never again."}
{"text":"I would give no stars if possible. Had lunch there and for the money you spend its not worth it. I bought a dinner portion of chicken shawarma on rice for 17.99 and was disgusted to find the entire container filled with rice and half a cup of chicken. If I wanted to spend that much on lunch I would have gone to get a steak ."}
{"text":"Had my birthday lunch party here with some friends. The food is amazing, great quality, it's fresh and the owner is very accommodating. There are many things to recommend on the menu. Lunch specials are a great deal, combos come with entree and choice of lentil soup, salad, or fries. Prices range from 7.99-12.99. The pineapple chicken wrap is delicious. The chicken shawarma, is very delicious. It has a fresh taste, the meat is done to perfection and had a tasty middle eastern spicy dressing. Each wrap comes with garlic sauce dip and a unique onion spice chunky salsa, makes great for dressing your wrap in. Fries are delicious and crispy, salad is fresh and crispy as well."}
{"text":"I'd come back, for sure. Yummy! When you have kids and you still can enjoy the food, Yknow it is good."}
