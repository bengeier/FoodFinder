{"text":"Love this restaurant!  I enjoyed the marinated chicken, salad, fresh hot roll, and fried squash.  Seasoning perfection!  Enjoyed every bite!  Staff professional and nice. Great time with my husband. He thought the pizza was the best!"}
{"text":"Tasty food, good pizza and reasonable prices for a non-chain small business.  I've always done take out but when picking up have noticed the interior is probably exactly the same as when it opened many decades ago.  I guess that adds charm for some and is a detractor to others.  Nonetheless, I'm happy to see a small business still in business and will continue to order from them"}
{"text":"This place reminds me of a small village Italian place you would find in a rural town.  I thought the prices were reasonably, I had the lasagna and it was pretty good and plenty filling.  As someone else noted the tomatoes in my salad should have been tossed the day before.

The service was efficient but there was several tables of regulars my server spent most of her time with.

I did like the place and like the idea of an owner run small restaurant.  A little fine tuning with service and double check the tomatoes would bring it up to 4 stars."}
{"text":"Don't waste your time or money.  My salad had a rotten tomato and a hair (not mine).  My waitress never offered another hairless salad even if I had wanted one.  The broiled flounder wasn't very hot and neither were my steamed veggies.  Both were SO BLAND I could have prepared a better version at home.  My mom had spaghetti with meat sauce and said it was just mediocre.  The owner asked how our meal was when I paid and insisted they use fresh tomatoes.  I'm sure they do but I had to spit mine out.  She discounted our drinks but I'll never be back!"}
{"text":"Never order take out - Order is never right for what you pay for - Crap shoot if the food is any good - Amazon don't bother, you will get robbed! We will never order from them again! Got the shaft way to many times and they could care less...cause they keep doing it! Amazon signing out!"}
{"text":"My family has been ordering from Demetrios for longer than I can remember. It's a family-owned restaurant and they underwent renovation about a year or so ago. I've only eaten inside once, and I ordered a pasta dish that was sadly mediocre. Where Demetrios shines for me is the pizzas and the salads. We've found a sweet spot- the Demetrios special (pizza) and the antipasto salad. The Demetrios special is basically a supreme pizza, and the antipasto salad has tomato, pepperoni, red onion, kalamata olives, ham, turkey, and cheese. They also have a Greek salad that's pretty good. I like being able to patronize a family owned business, so even though Vasileio's has my favorite pizza, I'll always make a second stop at Demetrios for a big salad to go alongside it. Don't get me wrong- the Demetrios special is solid. But Vasileio's has me sold on their supreme. So now I frequent both. I was really happy to see Demetrios's family revamp their restaurant and hope they're able to keep it going for a long time."}
{"text":"This place is alright. It is a typical greek owned pizza place. The pizza is actually pretty good though and so are the subs. A lot of the other dishes not so much. Just pretty mediocre but decently priced. My wife doesn't like it much so we hardly ever go. I think it's biggest problem like a lot of restaurants is consistency. Sometimes it is good sometimes its not."}
{"text":"This is one those whole of the wall kind of places. 
I have been here with my husband twice so far and we enjoyed both experiences. 
They have great food and good service and the best part is the price you pay for the amount of food you get. Totally worth it! 
They are a Italian/Greek restaurant and they have a pretty amount of options to choose from as pasta, pizza, salads, sandwiches and breakfast all day. 
They also have some dessert options that unfortunately we haven't tried yet but can't wait to do it :)"}
{"text":"I've driven by a hundred times and decided to give Demetrios a try. I called Friday evening for takeout pizza. The staff was very friendly on the phone. Pick up was easy and very reasonable for non-chain pizza. The pizza was very tasty and I will definitely return."}
{"text":"the food is really good and homemade. pizza really good, owner makes incredible homemade desserts, friendly staff.  nice non-chain restaurant"}
{"text":"The eggplant Parmesan is FABULOUS!   My friend always has the pizza and says it is really good.  Service is friendly.  Its clean.  Local place that I will continue to come back to again and again!"}
{"text":"My wife and I live in the area and have passed by this place numerous times. Every time we pass by, I say to her, \"we really need to try that place.\" There are always cars there, so that is normally code for \"good food.\"  

We went on a weekend and were seated right away. It wasn't that crowded but we went after the lunch rush hours. I will say, going that late ended up being the wrong move, since it was Country Style Steak day and by then, they were out!! I could feel my heart breaking in my chest. Once I got over it and wiped the tears from my eyes, I placed an order for Chop Sirloin with rice and gravy and green beans. 

The food was really good. The best part was, it was inexpensive. The bread that came with the food was also really good. I will note, they serve breakfast until 2PM, so I was on the fence if I wanted breakfast or lunch. I'm sure I will try their breakfast very soon. 

The staff were all nice and very friendly. I would recommend this place to anyone in the area looking for a nice hot meal that reminds you of grandmas Sunday cooking."}
{"text":"BEST pizza around!! My waitress was nice and the service was good. We order our pizzas from here for take out, as well as eat there."}
{"text":"I went there this past Saturday night 11/16/13 and ordered the flounder.  It was supposed to come with a side salad and two sides.  I cannot eat salad so ordered the soup.  Turns out they don't have soup. I decided to substitute the salad with something else on the menu, like the mixed vegetables.  Turns out they don't have mixed vegetables which is on the menu.  So I asked for the rice, which is also on the menu and the waitress said they don't have rice either.  So instead of the rice I ordered a baked potato.  That's all she brought.  Broiled flounder, which was very good and a baked potato, which was the usual baked potato.  She did not ask me if I wanted a different appetizer to substitute for the lack of a salad or another side since they didn't have the rice on the menu.  She didn't even ask me if I wanted tarter sauce or cocktail sauce so I ate it straight up.  It was still good.
My friend ordered the salad and shrimp scampi (very small portion) and pasta as the side.  We got garlic bread which was too thick and not enough butter.  (well, I'm sure it was margarine or some sort of oil).
I have been to this restaurant many times in the 34 years I have lived n Belmont, even when it was a Chinese restaurant.  It used to have the best pizza in town but frankly, Simonetti's is far better and I don't expect to go back to Dimetrio's.  My friend liked it but he loves everything so he is no quality assurance judge.
I would recommend Demetrio's for pizza only and take-out, not dine-in.  If you want good fish in Belmont go to catfish Cove or Amber Jack's Or Captain D's, all of which are very good!"}
{"text":"We will not be going back to Demetrios they seated us in booth 16 my wife said she smells dog poop so I looked underneath the table and surely there was dog poop. They moved us and never did clean it up took no money off the bill! We did get some free cheesecake? Sorry us not good for business!"}
