{"text":"Worst experience ever. I ordered online for delivery. The tracker went through all the phases and stated food was out for delivery, then changed to delivered yet no delivery made. I never received my order. I then attempted to call the store for information, they never answered the phone, I attempted to contact them for 30 mins. with no resolution."}
{"text":"I used to be a big fan of \"the other pizza chain that specializes in pan pizza\". When we found out that Dominos makes pan pizza we had to try and now we are hooked. It's less greasy and the cheese is much better. Dominos is now our favourite pizza chain!  And this location is our favourite place to go! The staff here are energetic, friendly and they really aim to please. I come here often now and they know me by name and we have a good conversation while I wait for my order. They know precisely how we like our pizza (not well done, but almost...).   We live outside the delivery area and we rather drive and pick up our pizza than to get delivery from the other location closer to our house."}
{"text":"They always forget something or another for my order and then refuse to deliver it. First offense can be forgiven however it seems like a constant thing with this location. Manager Katy is rude and refused to help."}
{"text":"So this review is about Domino's customer service in genefal. I ordered a pizza from the foster ave domino's a little over a month ago . Now it isn't a huge deal but they forgot to put one of the toppings on the pizza. Hey, I paid for the 3rd topping so I wax a little annoyed.  Yes it was the workers at this dominos who forgot,  but I'll give them props that customer service was good when I came to get the pizza, the young lady at the front was friendly , gave me extra red peppers etc.. My bigger pet peeve goes out to dominos customer service I emailed about the issue and their reply was basically sorry stuff happens , we will reach out to the owner. I emailed again offering to show a copy of the receipt and perhaps some sort of reimbursement, I wasn't expecting full.monet back on the pizza.no Rey ever. I tweeted them, no reply. I left a fb message for them, they relied they would look into it but they never emailed back. So I hate to say do the eat at this dominos , it seems u just. They made a silly mistake missing a topping. Some sort of response from corporate to a comsumer more than hey stuff happens would've been appreciated. These stars reflect my overall opinion on dominos."}
{"text":"Pizza was 20 minutes late and cold.  The Coca-Cola was the warmest thing in the order."}
{"text":"Called in a pizza the guy took my order over the phone and said it would be ready in 15 minutes. Walked into the store and the guy that took my order said that it wasn't ready that he couldn't find my order made me wait an extra 20 minutes for my pizza. Horrible service not reliable and didn't feel appreciated or welcomed at all."}
{"text":"Its Dominos. You know what you are going to get when you order here.   But the reason why I'm giving this franchise 5 stars is the Customer Service that I receive. They are kind, friendly, and they do their best to fix any issues that might arise. I have never received an attitude when I have brought problems to their attention whether it was an online order or instore."}
{"text":"I never had issues with them. Always the delivery was done on time. The staff is very friendly neat and clean. One of my fav stores near my place."}
{"text":"It really is rare to get good customer service at a Pizza Place, but that's exactly what happened last night when I called in. The guy who answered the phone helped me find a special that would work for us and also made recommendations as far as what we should order. I felt like he was actually happy to be there. The food was, well Domino's, so you know it's going to be pretty good.  The jalapeno bacon cheese bread was awesome"}
{"text":"After a recent SHITE trip to Streets of New York (which is the most accurate way of describing how their pizza tastes) I really need to vouch for this Domino's. As noted before, they are always fast and friendly. They have the nicest delivery drivers. Unlike Streets. Domino's has never made me sick either."}
{"text":"This review isn't about a certain location, but I need to say something about their sexist new commercials!  Really, women ruin pizza night?  Not ever ordering from them again, especially now they 'have salads'.  If this location receives this input, please pass it on.  Not a funny commercial!"}
{"text":"I wish I could give this place a 0 star. Ordered online, a pizza and a sandwich. We asked for white sauce for the pizza, and when the pizza came that's literally all we got. Crust was burnt and the three slices of sausage were literally swimming in the sauce, oh yeah, they also didn't put cheese on it. So we got soggy, burnt bread. You couldn't even pick up a slice without sauce spilling all over you. We called the location to ask for a refund. So a woman claiming to be the manger was put on the phone. She said her name was Sarah, and she was the most awful person I've ever had the displeasure to speak to. Again, we asked for a refund, which she declined and insisted upon another pizza or a store credit. When we insisted on a refund again, declining the credit she then threatened to block our orders? What? What does that even mean? She was very rude, and short and still refused to refund our order, then completely cut us off, telling us our credit would be processed in a week. Do yourself a favor and never order from this location."}
{"text":"Worst service i have ever received! I had to call 5 frickin times and each time to have them hang up on me! I live on 64th and Thomas and for them to tell me they can't deliver from 68th street and Thomas is a joke! You have just lost a costumer and next time hire employees with a college education."}
{"text":"Ordered pizza twice from here and as usual unedible!! Your better off just buying frozen pizza. Never had pizza so bad from a place!!! This place gives Domino's a very bad rep!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Alright needed to change up my weekly pizza routine and had a craving for their Brooklyn style pepperoni pizza.  It was my first time to this location and I had placed my order online.  It was a quick and simple process so no complaints there.  This location is tucked in behind the new recently rebuilt Ernest Manning high school across from West side rec centre, you can't see it from 69th street so you might miss it the first time.   There's parking out front, the location is small but looked clean and shiny.  Service was good and the pizza was hot and ready when I arrived. Now only if I had one of those heated bags to keep the pizza hot on the way home. :p"}
{"text":"We like this dominos they do a great job at making our pizzas we usually get delivery from them. We have ordered lots from this dominos and every time we have ordered we have had great pizza. But there was one time we ordered and they messed up on our pizza by not putting enough sauce cheese and toppings on it. I would recommend this dominos because this has only happened once out of the 15 times we have ordered from here."}
{"text":"If you want cheap pizza that tastes good go to Little Caesars 5 Bucks and your out the door! Unfortunately when I order here I get cold pizza looks like crap and comes with no peppers and cheese!  But ya I suppose you get what you pay for =)"}
{"text":"I ordered online almost two hours ago & my tracker says it's still in the oven. I tried calling the store to figure out what the issue was/ if I could cancel my order & they wouldn't answer the phone."}
{"text":"Pizza tasted good, but the way the sliced the pizza one slice three times bigger than other, seriously?? I'm glad I ordered online because after reading all the negative comments about rude customer service, at least I didn't have to deal with that."}
{"text":"I've been seeing the semi-desperate \"give us another try! We don't stink anymore!\" Domino's commercials for months.  Finally, a Groupon made me and the S.O. bite.  As in, we TOOK one bite and let the kids polish off the rest.  Nothing against this location in particular, but this is exactly how I remember the Domino's of yore:  greasy and tasteless.  I really don't know how this chain is still in business.  Save your money.  Bleargh."}
{"text":"First time we have ordered from Domino's in 15 years. We had pizza and wings delivered. Outstanding delivery person named Greg and the pizza was some of the best we have had in a long time."}
{"text":"good specials...fast delivery...pizzas usually made exactly as ordered. good quality..drivers always friendly"}
{"text":"Always great service on the phone and prompt delivery! Make sure to ask for crushed red pepper and parmesan cheese..they forget sometimes...lol"}
{"text":"Each and everytime the order is awesome! No complaints use the online tracker not as much salt and grease et al. as Papa Johns (sorry).....  Dominos is our first choice and our store does an outstanding job (N. Central) Phoenix.  Keep up the good work"}
{"text":"Worst pizza service ever, wish I could do half a star. Ordered from here and send me to other dominos which is closed 1.5 miles away. Called back no service"}
{"text":"Used to be decent. Last two orders have been wrong.  Also ordered hours in advance to have delivered at a specific time.  I had to call them when they were late to get them to deliver it 45 minutes later.  Never using these morons again, they just don't care."}
{"text":"Ordered from this location 2 days ago for delivery. We got 2 of the pasta bowls, a medium pizza, a sandwich and a brownie cookie thing. When we got our order, the pizza box was crushed and everything inside was mashed. So I called and asked for it to be remade and sent out. They did, no argument. When they got to my door, I gave them the destroyed pizza so they knew I wasnt trying to get free food, but they said to keep it. (It was tossed out anyway because all the toppings where stuck to the top of the box and the soggy cradboard was peeling into the pizza).  Anyway, point of the story is that my friend got horrible food poisoning and was puking all night. She was still feeling terrible the next day and didnt eat anything. I've never seen her in so much pain. Like she was dry heaving at one point because there was nothing left in her stomach. Her stomach was not happy, not at all.  I personally didn't get food poisoning, but I didn't have any of the pizza, or brownie cookie or her chicken pasta bowl. So one of those 3 items got her sick. I had the other pasta bowl and sandwich. I just hope it wasn't the remade pizza that got her sick because that is beyond wrong to do to someone on purpose.   Needless to say, there was no left over pizza day. I tossed out everything out the next morning just to be safe. I've ordered from here a few times. This was the first time I've asked for anything to be remade and the first occurrence of food poisoning. Coincidence? You decide."}
{"text":"Always get fast and friendly service and food is always good. My go to for delivery or a late meal"}
{"text":"I've ordered from here many times and have always been satisfied until tonight. 30 minutes from the time it left the store to the time it got to the door. I can see the store from my top floor window - a stones throw away. The thought of my food farting around a car for 30 minutes is not satisfying. I could make a pizza faster."}
{"text":"I love the pepperoni pizza at this place. Dominos uaed to be famous for a fast, greasy pizza. They have really cleaned up their act. Their pizza rivals those at NYPD. Great choice for a good late night pizza."}
{"text":"I refuse to order pizza from this dominos ever again. The delivery takes entirely too long and tonight was the last straw. I don't understand why it takes almost an hour and a half to make a pizza and delivery it 5 minutes down the road. Don't waste your money here. This \"establishment\" is poorly ran, and I refuse to waste my money here. Awful. The pizza we ordered isn't even warm anymore by the time it arrives."}
{"text":"This Domino's Pizza location has been a lifesaver on many occasions when i'm craving something tasty. They are always fast and accurate & have never gotten my order wrong. The service is always great and I would recommend this place to anyone!!"}
{"text":"Ordered 2 medium pizzas for $5.99/each at 1 am on a Saturday night. Got my pies within 30 mins. Fast, cheap, decent quality; would buy again."}
{"text":"I was never a fan of Dominos earlier as their pizzas were at the best ok, but come now this my goto pizza place. Their veg pan pizzas are simply delicious. The quality and taste of pizza is very good.   This store is completely transormed and look amazing inside. I found it neat and clean. I hope they continue to maintain their quality.   I have not tried delivery so cannot comment about it."}
{"text":"I am more excited about writing this review than I am about ordering from this dominos again. They have terrible service and are very rude. I asked for a pepperoni pizza with heavy sauce and when I got home from picking it up the pizza had little to no sauce on it at all, less than you would find on a normal pizza. So I gave them a call thinking they just mixed it up and we could replace it, apparently not. They were very rude and said they used a ton of sauce and they can't do anything. I'm upset because I wasted my money and couldn't even get it fixed, at no point in time was I rude to them either, they just have zero sense of customer service. I wouldn't recommend coming to this location because if something gets messed up, they basically tell you to just deal with it."}
{"text":"Been here a few times, it's not bad. Decent delivery.  Certain menu items they should drop, but it's not the fault of this store."}
{"text":"After my last bad order with this dominos I wanted to try them again. Well this time my fucking order never showed up not even a phone call. Someone needs to be fired"}
{"text":"Ready for pick up in a flash! Love this Domino's!"}
{"text":"Let me start out by saying all items made it on delivery. We ordered two medium pepperoni pizzas with bread sticks and cinnamon sticks and 2 ltr coke. Everything was fine until we opened the pizza. The smell of rancid pepperoni filled the air. We couldn't believe it. So I called the store to inform them that I didn't want a refund and that they may be serving rancid pepperoni. The person answered and became very ignorant and rude when I politely claimed there was a problem. After showing his ignorance and stating that the only reason for my complaint is because he's not American, I could see there was no point to proceed further. They burned me for 25.75 + 5.25 tip. I'm not one to complain if I have a serious complaint I just don't return. But this one I will be forwarding to corporate for further review. No franchisee should have people who work for them like these guys. Wazeen is the mgr and was supposedly not around when I called. No certified food safety mgr on duty! No wonder ACHD Wants letter grades for restaurants."}
{"text":"The first time we ordered from here we ordered 2 cheese pizzas with a side of garlic butter. It took them over an hour and a half to deliver the pizza. By the time we received them they were cold and they forgot our garlic butter. Plus the cheese pizza was a little burnt.  That was over a year ago so we decided to try it again. We ordered 2 cheese pizzas and cheese bread with a side of garlic butter and marinara. It took them an hour and 15 minutes to deliver the items. The pizza was not up to other domino pizzas we've had, there's was hardly any garlic on the crust. Also they forgot both the dipping sauces we paid for. We called the first time and they told us they could give us store credit and then they hung up on us. I called back and said that we would like the dipping sauces now because we're not ordering again so we will not be using the credit. They said they would get the sauces to us in 25 minutes, she apologized once and then hung up the phone. We never received the sauces, never ordering from this location again."}
{"text":"Best Dominos in town! My company gets pizza here pretty frequently and in large orders. They are always super nice to us, the pizza is always made on time, and made just minutes before pick up time so that it's fresh.   The staff is always helpful and professional. They even offer to lend us a fancy insulated pizza pouch so we can keep our pies warm on the way to the office.   I don't eat pizza often but I always come here if I do despite living 2 minutes from another location."}
{"text":"The pizza was \"OK\" at best which sucks because I love Dominos. The driver took 30 minutes to deliver and we live 6 minutes away. The pizza could have been cooked better the cheese was melted like usual. So maybe we won't be ordering from this store anymore. All together service, delivery and satisfaction was a 2 star rating."}
{"text":"We've been buying pizza from this Domino's since the day it opened.  Although we are infrequent pizza buyers, it is nice to know we can count on the easy ordering system online as well as fast, polite delivery service.  Is there better, fancier pizza in the marketplace?  Sure - but none as good at this price point.  Two bucks for delivery is reasonable, too.   Keep up the good work."}
{"text":"The pizza from this location is consistent and predictable.  Probably not going to win any gourmet prizes, but it is hot, tasty and delivered timely.  I don't know who is looking for more toppings - we've never noticed that to be a problem at this store.  The price is very fair and who couldn't love the website?  So much better than phoning it in."}
{"text":"How can you not have mushrooms????? I am done with Dominos this was my last and final attempt to get a pizza that they have failed twice before. I can promise never to step foot into any other location this franchise owner decided to open. Ran out of mushrooms it's comical!"}
{"text":"The pizzas are usually pretty good, so I decided to try one of their sandwiches. Chicken Parmigiana. Was good except that I thought it was way overpriced and way too small. Especially for $9.90something. I'll stick to the pizza."}
{"text":"We ordered our pizza online from their website, and our food was ready in no time!   Food: We ordered a medium pizza with pepperoni and green peppers, and garlic sticks. The pizza was really good, but the garlic sticks were not very good in my opinion, and didn't taste like much.   Service: The guy serving me was very friendly and efficient.  However, we ordered two marinara sauce cups for the garlic sticks, and only ended up receiving one. No big deal, but still.   Overall experience at this Domino's location was great, and would order from them again!"}
{"text":"I wish i could no star. Horrible service.  My order left their at midnight and I got my good at 1225. Not only was my pizza cold But the box was open.  And pizza cold and a mess. The manager was no help at all. Order to remake at 1235. To top if off the driver didn't give change said thanks n ran. Worst business ever don't deal w these fucks"}
{"text":"Placed an order using the online app and received an error code saying the order did not go through. Checked my bank account and I had a pending charge from dominos for the order amount, so I called the location to get the problem fixed. Spoke with a manager named Adrian and he tells me he doesn't have an order in his system and I said I know the app gave me an error code but my bank has a pending transaction. Adrian tells me yeah that's the way banks work. Thanks for the professionalism Adrian. I know how banks work I buy something and my bank pays the establishment from my account. In this case I'm not getting what I being charged for. Thanks for taking the time to rectify the problem Adrian.  Dominos will never get my business again because of Adrian poor customer service."}
{"text":"Ordered a pizza to the lobby of my hotel, \"The Hyatt on W. Wash.\" Phone died and I sat in he lobby for over an hour and watched Toppers and Pizza Hut come in. When I finally got my phone charged, I called said location and they got frustrated when I didn't have the exact location of the hotel and hung up on me. I called back and spoke to a different person and they finally told me the couldn't find my location and tried calling me. When I didn't answer, they straight up canceled my order. One would assume that it's not that hard to find the only high rise hotel on the entire street. I feel I was blown off and then blown off again when I called about my order an hour later. Poor poor poor customer service!"}
{"text":"They get every other order right. When they fuck up its huge. Nothing like suprise jalapeños in your cheesy bread. Then having the \"manager try to give me excuses\". She tried to tell me something about the over making it hard for them. I was like I don't want excuses. Come get your shit food. It will be on my doorstep."}
{"text":"I can't remember the last time I ordered a pizza, but I was in a rare mood tonight and they had a good deal.  I ordered a pepperoni & mushroom pizza for delivery, and received... pepperoni and pineapple. No thank you! I called, and was delivered the proper pie promptly, no charge. Despite the mess up, they were great about correcting it. As Dominoes pizza go, it was very tasty (you adjust your expectations) and I love the cinnamon stix. My delivery person was a wonderful (fast & friendly) young woman and I never got a bad attitude for asking for a correct order. Impressed by the speed on a Friday night!"}
{"text":"Just found hair in the pizza. Eww! Never again from this location will I order food, blah!"}
{"text":"The best Domino's around! Very clean store, professional staff!! Great pickup experience!"}
{"text":"They always get my order right and it's always ready on time.  A+ pizza. I wish all Domino's were run as well as this one."}
{"text":"This is usually my go to for delivery pizza and it's usually good but this time I'm not sure what happened.... the crust no longer had the garlic herb seasoning on it... my sausage was cut into odd little squares, the amount of toppings overall was less than usual. My boyfriend and I were left very disappointed. The chain as a whole really did a big turnaround (or so we thought) and I'm not sure if it's just this particular branch but will definitely not be ordering again."}
{"text":"Since most of the 5 star reviews for this place are from 2013-2015, I have to assume they are under different management now. It's a shame because I ordered a pizza from here believing that it would exceed my expectations like always and I was sadly disappointed. After watching the pizza tracker for an hour and half I decided to call for an update. Come to find out the store had canceled my order. When I asked them why they canceled my order they told me someone else who lived on the same street had placed an order and canceled so they must have canceled mine by accident. No apology for the inconvenience, just \"Do you wanna place your order again? No, okay bye.\" Do yourself a favor, get a decent pizza from somewhere else. This place is not what it used to be."}
{"text":"I like domino's pizza when I just want to have cheap pizza delivered.  This location however is awful.  They have messed up the last 3 orders.  1, the crust was missing its seasoning completely and the cheese was half missing - what?  2. the order arrives well over 30 minutes late and wasn't piping hot like you expect.  When i called to check on my tardy order, the manager Carla was rude and told me \"not to worry about it.\" What again?  3. I ordered a hand tossed, to hopefully get the garlicky crust I missed out on previously, and they delivered a pan pizza 10 minutes late.  How does one make the online order THAT wrong?  It prints out.  There are only so many crust options.  Carla was rude this time too - if you mess up okay, but don't make it worse by treating your already frustrated paying customer like crap."}
{"text":"I love Domino's pizza! The APP is easy to use. The service is fast and friendly. What more could you ask for? Oh yes, did I say the pizza is delicious already, yes the pizza is delicious!"}
{"text":"As soon as a had placed order it was ready... By the time i drove to pick it up.it was nice and stiff...no moisture ...and was made in a hurry  Spinach didn't smell fresh at all had the dark moist gone bad smell.. Nada..ill pick up my pizaa from elsewhere"}
{"text":"I received my pizza in about 40 minutes which wasn't too bad at all. Yet the delivery guy who was a older gentalman who went by the name of \"jay\" made sure to apologize about how long it took and that they were running a little slow. He was very friendly and apologized multiple times even though we garenteed he was fine and we were not worried about how long it took. All I can say is I wish there where more people like him in this world."}
{"text":"We ordered a carry out thin crust pizza which was ready on time and accurate.  The online ordering process is very efficient and great when you want to get a pizza quickly and take it home.  I like the thin crust and it was done correctly but they were very stingy on the ingredients.  The tomato sauce was not spread across the entire pizza making the outer pieces somewhat dry.  The amount of crumbled Italian sausage was minuscule and I could barely taste the onions or mushrooms.  They did get the half sausage and half anchovies correct and those were in appropriate amounts.  I like Domino's pizza but was disappointed in the overall taste."}
{"text":"Never again, never again will I return to this Vegas style food. I knew it was a gamble. The convenience of ordering delivery is not going to be the deciding factor again! 2am visit to St. Joseph's emergency room with stomach pain, vomiting and diarrhea. Morphin I-V DRIP & Few thousand dollars in medical bills, Unpaid-unapproved day off of work The moment I was released from the hospital I went directly to the Maricopa County Environmental building and filed a formal complaint with the Health dept. Save yourself if you are reading this, just eat somewhere else, or at one of your safe regular spots. I'm done. Only gave this place a star so that I could add this review, otherwise"}
{"text":"Very disappointed ... When it gets to our door Taste like cardboard and the two large pizza were cold , slightly warm ... No I will not have them delivery again !"}
{"text":"We've been ordering from this Domino's for about 9 years now, at least twice a month, sometimes more. The Tuesday BOGO makes my life, and their deep dish is delicious, the best I've had outside Chicago. The value is excellent when you use the coupons, and it's filling and tasty. We almost exclusively order online so we rarely have to speak to humans aside from the delivery guys, and it looks like the negative reviews mostly arise from interacting with the people in the store. They almost never mess anything up and delivery is super fast, generally 20-25 minutes, rarely over 30. The quality of the pizza is really consistent, unlike most other places I order from, never over-done or under-done. And Brooklyn pepperoni FTW!"}
{"text":"Ordered over the phone the 2 for $5.99. Was literally 2 miles away and waited an hour for delivery. When I  opened it up and one item was wrong so I called and was told they would send the correct order to me. Then 2 min later the manager called me back to tell us that she had 2 employees that both claim they heard me order what was sent.  Basically called to say I was a liar and that she didn't believe me but was going to send it to me anyways. A+ customer service"}
{"text":"An employee here named Hunter was very helpful when I arrived and my order got done in about 13 minutes for pick up . It was excellent customer service and I got my food quick . Thank you hunter for your excellent service !"}
{"text":"If we could give this negative 5 stars, we would! We ordered a pizza over the phone and wanted to order one of their specials. Their promo code was not working online so that's why we had to order it over the phone. When we tried to order the girl said they didn't have that promotion. She kept arguing with us so we let it go. We finally placed our order and went to the gas station not even a block away to get some sodas. We got back and waited about 30 more minutes (it only took us no more than 10 minutes to go to get drinks AND come back) and we hadn't received our pizza yet. Totaling to about a 40 minute wait since we placed the order. My husband calls to see where our pizza is and the girl says the driver left ten minutes ago. Now if my math is correct, 10 minutes ago from 40 minutes is 30 minutes. And 30 minutes was the promise time. Before my husband can say much more, the girl hangs up on him...! 50 minutes have now gone by and we still have no pizza. My husband calls back to cancel our order and get a full refund. The girl said that she hadn't charged us yet. The girl yet again, hung up on him. About two minutes later my husband gets a call and when he says hello, the guy on the other end says, \"I have an order for you.\" Not, I'm sorry I'm running late, or I'm here but lost. My husband told him he canceled the order and he still didn't say anything about where our pizza's were!! My husband checked his account and the money was pending, after the girl said he wasn't charged yet. He called the location and got the delivery driver. He asked if we could hold and my husband said no, we need to speak to someone about why we were wrongfully charged... AND THE GUY HUNG UP ON US!!!! We tried calling back and nobody would answer the phone. So we went to the location to get a refund. The girl we first spoke to tried telling my husband she never said she didn't charge us. Not once did they offer a discount or the pizza's on the house for the delivery drivers mistake. They just had the attitude of, \"well I don't know what to tell you.\" We will NOT be giving our business to this location and WILL NOT be referring this location. My husband could not have spelled it out more clear to everyone there that they have poor customer service. And as someone who works in customer service, you cannot work in that kind of a job without it..."}
{"text":"we ordered over 70 bucks worth of food! everything is super delicious! especially the specialty chicken OH MY GOWD i swear to god i crushed two boxes of them in like 10 minutes WHY ARE THE SO TASTYYYYY ?!!!! the deliver is super fast and our driver is really friendly, he even carry all the food up to 3rd floor for us (because there is a lot of food hehh :) Great Job Domino's! I'll for sure order from this location again! and again, and again..."}
{"text":"I've gotta say, dominoes has stepped up Their game. Their still no Grimaldi's or Metro but for the price you can't beat it. They use better ingredients and the staff is friendly. I ordered online this evening and it was really simple. I like that u can 'track' your pizza and see what's going on with your order. From now on when we order pizza it's only Dominoe's or Rosatie's :)"}
{"text":"I ordered here about half an hour before they closed.  Apparently do not do that because they definitely did something to our pizza as my whole family got food poisoning and were constantly throwing up hours after we ate their food.  Please pass this around to as many people as you can, I wouldn't want this to happen to anyone else."}
{"text":"We ordered pizza from there a few months ago and will never do it again! Our food got delivered to someone else, so instead of making fresh food, they picked up the food from the wrong house and brought it us. Not only was the food ice cold, there was finger marks in the food and you could see where someone took a bite. Called to tell them we wanted a refund and were not going to pay for food we wouldn't touch due to sanitary issues and it was just gross. 45 minutes later they came with our refund and to collect all the food."}
{"text":"terrible brought half our order then tried to tell me to pay other half when it came spoke to manager and he was rude dismissive and did not care about what happened!!! never will again order from them IGNORANT!!!"}
{"text":"I will not be ordering from this location again. I have tried twice now and both times it has taken over an hour before it's even out for delivery."}
{"text":"They'r really fast. It take 15 minutes top and the pizza is really good for the affordable price. I found the staff friendly and polite. Don't bother to call, the online ordering experience is amazing with the interactive visual pizza builder and the 5-stage tracker which I found very accurate! Plus Dominos usually have some deals and coupons on their website."}
{"text":"Basically a digiorno pizza with extra parmesan and garlic powder... If you sign up for an $8.95 a month shoprunner account you can save $3 on the delivery fee... a monthly bill for pizza deliveries? hahaha NO"}
{"text":"I was totally a holdout and not thrilled about the fact that domino's was the closest pizza joint. But their advertisements about being completely improved were legit. Their pizza is about the best chain pizza you can find. Not as good as a local or italian joint, but vastly improved upon any national pizza chain and waaaaaay better than the old domino's!"}
{"text":"New to the area and this is consistently the worst dominos experience I've had (and I order a lot of dominos)! I seriously doubt a yelp review effects anyone when it comes to place like dominos, but hey man, I'm here to advise you that you will more then likely get your pizza an hour or so on top of the time the app tells you. Four or so times we have ordered with a expected wait time of ~50 minutes and gotten a call saying it'll be more like 2 hours. At least 2 of the times the pizza never actually came and we got refunded. The manager has always been nice about it."}
{"text":"Fast and friendly service .  Well priced and nicely made pizzas!  Parking could be an issue since the plaza is busy most of the time but still manageable ."}
{"text":"Been using this Dominos location for a couple of years. Always great product and friendly delivery drivers. Rapidly fixed an ordering mistake a couple of months ago, no questions asked. If they are close to you, use them! Can't go wrong."}
{"text":"I place my order via the Internet. the website is very user friendly, not a lot of unnecessary questions. Pizza tracker on the website is pretty cool with the exception of the  \"quality check\"  for whatever reason this store seems to skip that step. I have posted a picture of the pizza that was delivered. Not very appetizing! the wings could have used a little more time in the oven.  I rated my experience on their website, and to my surprise within minutes I was contacted by a manager that goes by the name of Talmadge. He was able to handle my concerns in a professional manner, for that reason my review goes from 1 star to 4."}
{"text":"I should have taken a picture of what was just delivered to my house and I am sorry that I did not. Flat, cold, and circle of uncooked nastiness. Wow. Domino's. You fail miserably and you will never receive another order from this household."}
{"text":"Keep an eye on your delivery people, folks!   My order arrives,  brought to me by a very young man, who starts to chit chat me up for a minute before our transaction. He proceeds to tell me that he had to get into work in a hurry and did not get a chance to pick up  any change. Naturally, he saw that I was paying him with a 20.  I told him, \"Sorry, but if you don't have change to give me, then I don't want my order.\". Gee!  All of a sudden,  he had change \"in his car,\"  but had to take it out of his own pocket.  I told him, that would be fine, and that I would hold the 20 until he could show me the change.  This is not the first time that this particular Domino's has done this to me. How stupid do they think we are? As soon as he left, I called the place and filed a complaint with the manager."}
{"text":"I have been ordering from this Domino's for about a year now and I am a huge fan.  I have never had any complaints with the exception of bacon missing from two of my specialty chickens.  I love ordering online, through my mobile app, and find both easy to browse.  The delivery drivers are all wonderful and respectful."}
{"text":"Disappointed that they don't have any ready made pizza when you walk in. Hoping to pop in and buy a slice and go I was told nothing is ready and had to sit and wait 15 minutes. Perhaps if pre-order is your focus, they are fine but would not recommend them for walk-in eating at all.  Also had a weird menu right now where you can't buy one slice they only sell in quantities of 2 slices? Bizarre...."}
{"text":"Pizza was not bad, just not the pizza I ordered.  Nothing worse than ordering a pizza exactly to your liking, picking it up and brining it home just to have a completely different pizza.  Ordered large Brooklyn style pizza, light sauce, pepperoni and double ham.  Pizza I got was ham and double pineapple.  So disappointing.  What's the point of an online ordering system if they get it wrong."}
{"text":"The pizza was here in what felt like minutes. It was perfect when we got it an the delivery guy was friendly. Overall made my whole experience that much better I am very pleased with this dominos. Again my pizza was amazing !!!!"}
{"text":"I just ordered a pizza from this store.  After an hour and a half of waiting, I called in and was told that my pizza was sitting on the stores counter.  The order was placed for delivery and the store manager confirmed this.  When I asked why it hadnt been delivered yet, she stated that they didnt get an apartment number from the online ordering.  I asked why she didnt call, she said she did.  Mind you, neither my husbands or my phone had any missed calls.  I asked if she left a VM, she stated \"Its not my job to track down my customers, we are busy\".  I asked for the GM, but she refused, I asked for the corporate information, she also refused.  She said she could send out the cold pizza now, I think Ill pass on Dominos, this girls attitude, and cold pizza."}
{"text":"Dominos is so much better, in every way now. And this particular store is quick with delivery. Good job guys!"}
{"text":"Very nice place. The customer service was great. They have a young lady by the name of Nicole who was awesome and very helpful. My first experience was great and I will definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"Nasty. If you go in here, you will notice the bullet proof glass separating you from the kitchen. The employees will laugh at you from behind their pizza fortress if you attempt to shoot them. But, I realize if you order pizza from here, you likely do not know what yelp is and/or you are drunk and hungry at 3am, so I don't know why I'm writing this."}
{"text":"Five stars not because Domino's is the best pizza on the planet, but because the owner and staff of this particular Domino's is truly fantastic.  The pizza is always dependable -- again, it's Domino's.  But Doug (owner) is committed to serving the community and goes above and beyond to help wherever he can.  This Domino's helps with community events, sponsors local fundraising efforts, and is always eager to help church and charity groups. I want to support this local business because of the way they help our community.  Thanks, Doug and team!"}
{"text":"Probably the worst customer service ever. After my pizza was nearly 30 minutes late, I tried to call the store. First call they left the phone off the hook for about 5 and I could hear them talking in the back ground.  The next time I called the same thing happened and they hung up on me. Finally I got through and asked the manager what they planned to do to make it right, because at this time the pizza was now 50 minuets out and I don't want a pizza that's nearly an hour old. They said they could remake it and I'd have to wait another 45 minuets. I asked them if they could do better than a 1 hour and 45 minuet ticket time. The manager refused to try to make it happen any faster then told me to call another store. I will NEVER order anything further from this location ever again.  I called back when it had been 1 hour and 45 minuets and they told me they cancelled the order. Yet, they didn't have the courtesy to tell me.  WORST SERVICE EVER."}
{"text":"It really sucks that they slow down their web page close to closing time. Dominos pizza you suck."}
{"text":"I love this location. The lady that usually takes my order is super nice.   I normally order a large cheese with mushrooms, meatballs, and black olives. It's always good and ready fast. My only complaint is that they be skimmping on the toppings sometimes,  I guess it depends on who makes it."}
{"text":"The pan pizza is delicious!, good service never too busy and there's plenty of parking space."}
{"text":"I normally enjoy pizza from here but my experience today made it hard. After picking up my pizza on my way out the door I noticed a big roach on the floor. I made mention of this to the cashier who did not seem to be shocked that there was a big roach on the floor. Considering that roaches are night bugs to see one on the floor in the middle of the day can be sign of infestation. Ony.my way out of the door I could hear him making light of the situation to the other workers.  TOTALLY GROSSED OUT"}
{"text":"Ive been eating dominoes for years on the eastcoast. It always sucked..so i havent have dominoes for about 12 years. Since relocating on the westcoast,ive decided to give it a go thinking things would be different. I ordered from the sahara location and was surprised. Pizza and service was great! Ive been hooked every since then. Even though sahara and the maryland parkway location is the same distance from me,i change my store  location to maryland. Things were different pizza was still good but boy they cant follow directions. I ordered a total of 5 times from this location ;to deliveries and 3 pick ups and each time they screwed my crust and did not give me square like i requested.why?i just dont understand!!!. On one occassion they got my pick up wrong, they said i have to bring the pizza back or receive a free pizza on my next visit. I decided to keep my screwed up order and get the free pizza because i was already to far away. While grocery shopping,idecided to pick up my free pizza. I ordered than picked up. When i got there and told the lady about my coupon thats under my phone number,she gave me an attitude as if i was lying..really weirdo..you gave me the damn coupon,(i remember her name...then get in the car to discover my order was WRONG AGAIN!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Really. Wtf..i cant im done!!!"}
{"text":"Love this dominos! They always have great customer service and keep busy. Love seeing them work together happy and outgoing instead of grumpy and goofing off."}
{"text":"Terrible customer service. They took over 90 minutes to deliver it and when I got it, it was cold and mushy. When I called I was put on hold for another 15 minutes and refused to send out a fresh one. Never ordering from this location ever again."}
{"text":"The pizzas great, and the people are nice, but they seem to have a problem with delivering our cinnastix. One time they forgot the frosting, and another time they for got them completely. Instead of bringing them to us, or giving us a free order, they said they'd give them to us next time. :/ yes, thank you for giving us what we've already paid for. They do always have good deals online, and I will still order from them when I'm feeling lazy and hungry, but they need to change something about their delivery orders."}
{"text":"We order at least once a week and it always come really hot.  Drivers have always been great too.  Only thing is sometimes the dough isn't as crisp as I would like for it to be."}
{"text":"We have been waiting over an hour for our food.  I called and the poor gentleman is running the location solo.  This happened last weekend around this time too.  Devon and Carson are very customer service oriented at this location.  Mark seemed overwhelmed, who can blame him?!?!"}
{"text":"If I could give negative stars I would. Placed my take out order online and was informed 55-60 minutes. Seems a bit long but it is Friday evening and somewhat understandable. I arrive at Dominoes after 60 minutes and I am told the order had not even been put in to bake. It would be another 20-30 minutes for my pizza. 90 minutes for a take out order. Also my children wanted a Dominoes pizza night, thus why we agreed to the 60 minute order time and buying from Dominoes. I am offered no apology, no options, nothing. A blank stare and a shrug of the shoulders. Meanwhile in the background I can here the workers laughing and acting nonchalant considering they are so behind. But what bothered my the most is when the cashier asks if so and so order was put in, one person in the back yells out \"probably not\" and they all laughed. It amazes me how poorly business treat the paying customers with no regard for satisfaction. I received no alert or notification that my order would be delayed. 90 minutes for takeover Dominoes pizza which I cancelled and will not go back."}
{"text":"I really love Domino's so today when I saw on ABC News that it was National Pizza Day, I thought I would call Domino's to see if they were running any local specials! It's worth a shot, right? Either way, I'm going to indulge in some pizza today, just not from this Domino's now. I was greeted on the phone by Brandi AKA the person who should be giving me the first impression of this store. I am brand new to the area and never ordered from this location before. She was less than enthusiastic and even though they weren't running any specials she couldn't politely told me instead of saying \"uhhhh....normal pizza specials.....\" I was assuming this meant they weren't having any specials for National Pizza Day and since I have worked in the service industry for years (restaurants, salons, telephones, etc.) I thought that maybe Brandi was just having a bad day. I wanted to cheer her up and in a very friendly tone said, \"Brandi, you don't seem too excited about National Pizza Day!\" She replied with \"uhhh...I'm really tired.\" Then she hung up!!!! Who knows, maybe I was going to order a pizza anyway! This was NOT the customer service I was expecting from this establishment or ANY for that matter and will be taking my business elsewhere."}
{"text":"Put quite simply, this Domino's is the crappy McDonald's of the pizza world.  Up until today, my transactions have been satisfactory. Once in a while, they forgot something little, like a ranch cup. Not a bit deal but slightly annoying, as you do pay for those.  Today they quite literally \"forgot\" half my order.  Upon the driver's arrival, I was handed my food, sans my 2 liter. He offered to go to GetGo to grab me one, and I accepted. He left, and in the meantime, I discovered that he'd also forgotten my two ranch cups. After nearly a half hour (GetGo is five minutes away) he came back with two 20 Oz pops. (I suck at math, but I know that's not the equivalent of a two liter). I told him about the ranch, and he said, \"only one convenience trip per delivery.\" Which is freaking ridiculous because I paid for a 2 liter and 2 ranch cups, and he was acting like this was him doing me a favor rather than him doing is actual job! What's worse is that I signed the slip and added a tip to the credit card total before I knew he'd forgotten my stuff!  I called the store and they agreed to give me a ten dollar credit for my next order. They did offer to have someone drop off the ranch, but by then, after waiting a half hour for my pop, the food was stone cold and I was hungry. My husband called - he didn't want to order from them ever again, and so a credit to the next order wasn't kosher for him - but the only way they said they'd give us a refund, even partial, is if we returned food! Never mind the fact that we were missing stuff.   Never again. I hope this place goes out of business."}
{"text":"Ordering online,delivery was very good . the pizza, I will never ever ever eat again it is the worst pizza I have ever had, I wasn't going to make a comment but i'm just disgusted I had to. More I think about it the matter I get come to think about it there was even hardly no mozzarella cheese on it. That's what really kind of makes a pizza! I see there is one star in my comment but it should be zero stars."}
{"text":"Dominos has gotten really good in the last few years.   You're saying, \"Five stars? For Dominos? C'mon.\"   No, you come on. Their pizza's good, it's fast, it's affordable, and their customer service is spectacular. Is it Spinato's or NYPD? No, but Spinato's not open late, they're way more expensive, and they don't have an awesome online ordering system.  For economy pizza delivery, it's basically the Hut vs Dominos vs Papa John's. Out of those three, my favorite is the big D."}
{"text":"I stopped ordering from every other pizza place in this area. Domino's on Blue Diamond has never gotten our order wrong, and it's always hot and fresh!"}
{"text":"Disgusted. My first and last time ordering from this dominos. I ordered HOT wings and got REGULAR soggy fatty wings. I could have probably saved money by making my own or throwing some frozen hot wings in the oven from the frozen section of the grocery store. My pizza which was thin and crispy looked like a card board burnt disc. Sad this what I ordered to feed my son for lunch. Never again. Ill stick with pizza hut."}
{"text":"I reallllllly appreciate the late delivery hours, especially as there is literally no other option till midnight around! Food was good and delivery guy Charles was fast and nice. Who knew I'd be giving Dominos a good review, but there it is. Well done Thomas St., Phoenix Location! Kudos also to the manager for accommodating the order well. :-D"}
{"text":"good deals, okay pizza, good wings mango great service"}
{"text":"Just the worst dominos in the world . Also , Lyndsi was the worst server of my life . I am just writing this here so she can change her shitty behavior"}
{"text":"If I could rate them 0 stars I would. We placed our order for 2 pizzas around 9pm and almost two hours later we still don't have our pizza. After calling and speaking to Josh he informed me that we would still have to wait another half hour for our pizza since the driver was out delivering 3 orders and there was 1 more order ahead of ours. So much for the 20-25 minute delivery time we were given when placing our order. Three hours to deliver two pizzas is absurd!"}
{"text":"I had a good experience. I placed my order online and my pizza was ready for pickup in 14 minutes. The staff was friendly. We had a pepperoni and sausage pizza. It was cooked well and was tasty. It made for a nice Friday movie and pizza night."}
{"text":"I have been ordering pizza from this location for almost 3 years now, usually it is mediocre but always an easy solution for dinner. Tonight we ordered pasta, pizza, and cheesy bread. When I received my order tonight it was raw and inedible. I am not one to complain or cause unnecessary conflict however my order was simply unacceptable. I called to express my distaste and the manager Adam was very rude and condescending, I simply asked for a refund or make the order right. He continued to argue that I was incorrect and they have strict standards. I've been eating pizza my entire life and this pie was not up to par it was raw. Dominoes claims to have reinvented themselves however this manager simply does not seem to care about their new image. I will not be ordering from this location again. Goodbye dominoes I'd rather support local pizzerias anyhow."}
{"text":"Good stuff, they messed up the order but were very polite and made a new one asap and compensated with lava cakes. Dominoes keeping it 100"}
{"text":"Just got pizza that we ordered 2 hours ago and it's cold. No offer for a refund and the driver shared,\"You can call up there and they'll say we can get you another pizza but it will take 2 more hours.\" This is unacceptable."}
{"text":"I'm so annoyed with this store and Domino's in general! Yes you can order online, that's nice.  But a few days ago (Sunday) we ordered 2 pizzas, after 45 minutes we decided to call the store only to find out the number you call is a call center.  They then transfer you to another call center that has the capabilities to transfer you to the store.  Well, after an hour we decided to cancel as we were all starving (and had to make a Taco Bell run), I explained to the manager that this was unacceptable so she gave me a few options. I chose to take a credit, even though we had not already paid, and give them another chance.  Well, today we gave them another try and it happened again.  A Tuesday afternoon and they are too busy to handle an order of 2 medium pizzas.  After nearly an hour our pizza showed up and it was hot, so that's good, but I'm done giving them chances.  There's plenty of cheap pizza places close to our home."}
{"text":"I order from here for delivery all the time. Always place my order online.  Never have a problem.  I've had a few deliveries that took awhile longer than I anticipated, but lately it's been quick and easy with no problems.  Pizza arrives hot most of the time. I can only think of one time that my pizza arrived NOT the way I ordered it.  That will happen.  But for the most part, food is fast, tasty, hot upon arrival and the delivery drivers are super cheerful and friendly."}
{"text":"When it comes to pizza delivery, flip a coin, because your experience will change daily.  Overall, I'm not disappointed.  It has to be pretty bad. Pizza is hard to screw up, because even overcooked is really extra crispy lol, so I don't mind. Unless my pizza is charcoal, or missing ingredients, I'm happy.  Delivery is prompt and food is tasty.  Happy to have a gluten free option too."}
{"text":"I ordered online my order was two pizzas they only made one  how hard is it to read a screen. What a bunch of fuckups"}
{"text":"I've ordered from here before with minor to major issues before, but tonight was especially bad. When I ordered, there was an estimated wait time of 45-60 minutes, which is pretty reasonable. An hour and a half after I ordered, I got a notification that it was in the car. 25 minutes after that, the driver got there, and boy was that an experience. When I complained about the excessive wait time, he started getting back in the car, threatening to cancel my order and insulting me. The food was lukewarm, and I'm just incredibly disappointed."}
{"text":"Listen...I understand that you cannot wait more then 2 minutes before the gate so it will open.....I understand you as the delivery driver didn't see me at the gate looking at you, walking to you to open the gate....I understand answering the phone politely and trying to figure out things for the better of both of us is a very hard thing to do.....but please don't send a creepy guy to my house on the second attempt, please don't tell me that you had to remake the pizza or reheat anything because according to the driver it was just sitting there with no attempt to accommodate me, the customer....I was willing to pay for the food and have reached out to you guys to compromise....I just hope you guys didn't do anything with my food....i pray that the food my children ate was ok.....this guy that was sent as a delivery guy had the biggest smile on his face....like somebody who just wiped their ass on a slice....."}
{"text":"Terrible location. The food is good but the service is lousy. They deserve every bad review they get."}
{"text":"Ever since mid-January 2015 a new owner has taken over this location and man, let me just tell you. SOOOOOOooOOOOoo much better! The pizza taste better, the toppings are nice and evenly put on the pizza. Before, whoever made the pizza were super greedy on the toppings and it looked like they just threw it on. Some slices had too much toppings and some didn't have any at all. Of course, all the pizza with toppings were taken first and the ones with no toppings were left, which no one wanted to eat.   Also, this new owner gives FREE cheese and peppers which is the way it SHOULD BE!!"}
{"text":"I have been ordering from this store for three years now and am finally getting around to writing a review. I would definitely say if you want the best quality pizza and service, order when Jillian is working! Her pizzas are perfection, every single time. She also really cares about getting the food out fast and delicious. If something is wrong, she will fix it, guaranteed."}
{"text":"The last two times I ordered pizza from here it took over an hour longer than promised and tasted like garbage. I understand sometimes things happen, so I gave them a second chance only to have a bad experience again. I won't be ordering from them again."}
{"text":"What a joke this place was. Dominoes has decent pizza but the staff here tonight sucked bad. First couldn't make a pizza that had one slice with only cheese for my kid. Then when I got there to pay I couldn't pay with a $50 bill. Then the guy says well \"you can run next door to get change\". Hahaa what service. I know it's only dominoes but how about this is US currency and you should run next door since you don't have change."}
{"text":"Very happy with our experience. Ordered online, delivered in 25 minutes. Did not get pizza, pasta was very good and so were the jalapeno  breadsticks. We will order here again, May try the pizza next time. Been years since had one from Domino's."}
{"text":"We've been ordering from this location for several years now and we're very happy with the service and the product. I think they only forgot to put jalapenos on the Firey Hawaiian once in the last 6 years or so, and it was forgivable. They're always fast and friendly."}
{"text":"Worse service ever... Waited over an hour n half for pizza.. Manager argued and was unconcerned with my order. Only thing missing from being the worst services possible is spit in my food and not putting that past them."}
{"text":"I ordered a thin crust, no cheese pizza with lots of veggies on it and it was delicious! Everything seemed fresh and of good quality. I'm very pleased to know that I have a place nearby where I can get yummy vegan pizza :) The person who helped me at the counter was very kind too!"}
{"text":"Ever since Dominos changed up their recipe/ingredients, their pizza has really been awesome. I enjoy the thin crust with spinach, tomatoes, and mushrooms.  Mmmm"}
{"text":"We keep trying to order and we understand its late but we are servers and we will tip so good but you're ignoring us...."}
{"text":"Don't order from this cheap people.. They don't care what you order they ll just ruined your food.. Very cheap service.. Better to drive 5 miles and get it from exton."}
{"text":"Totally agree with April O. I placed an order 2 days ago at 11 pm, the guy told me it would take them 30 to 45 minutes it was about to be 1am when i decidedto call Dominos (the store manager answered). Told me no order was pending so since they were closed he decided to give me credit so the next day same time i called to reorder same 30 to 45 minutes called no one anwered. So today I called again and store manager answered and told me that when my order went through there was a \"NO DELIVER TO THIS ADDRESS.\" Seriously what kind of business is this....NEVER EEEVER will I order pizza from here. Worsed service & experience...."}
{"text":"Terrible customer service!! We had ordered pizza the night before we got a confirmation number and the tracker started we also used our domino's reward points to get the pizza on top of other things... I waited forever and finally called no answer so I was upset but thought oh well technology sucks sometimes Ill just call tomorrow I'm sure they'll sort it out. NOPE! their answer was we can't do anything about it and the manager didn't even talk to me about it. I'm a bartender and a waitress and my employer would NEVER treat a customer this way. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"I always get great food and service from this location. They always bring my food quickly when I order for delivery. When I have had small issues, they have done everything they can to fix it. Thanks guys; keep up the great work!"}
{"text":"Thin crust is so good!!! Omgggg!  Forget the other fancy places on Queen street lol not only is this cheaper and they have better online deals, it's also faster and delicious!! :D I recommend their spicy wings too! I was totally impressed by Dominos. It exceeded my expectations! Yeah yelp, you heard me! Don't judge me, Dominos's thin crust is surprisingly good!"}
{"text":"Thought we'd try the \"new\" Domino's.Got 2 weekly 2 topping thin crust.  for 5.99 each.Barely any toppings for a good flavor.Cardboard crust.Just because its thin doesn't mean it has to taste like cardboard.I could've shmeared some sauce on a paper plate,a sprinkle of cheese and POOF! I'm a Domino's pizza maker! Would've given one star for truth but it was ready in 10 minutes.Remembering yummy things are worth the wait."}
{"text":"Over the lunch hour, during school hours, while school zones were active, the delivery driver from this Domino's location went FLYING past us while travelling east-bound on Queen Creek Road through the SCHOOL ZONE that runs in front of Bogle Junior High and across from Jacobson Elementary.  (We know he was speeding because we were going the speed limit in the center lane and travelling in the same direction when he went flying by us in the right lane.)  Shortly thereafter, we saw the same driver in the same black Honda with the same license plate number and with the Domino's placard attached while at the red light at Alma School and Queen Creek Road and *watched him* turn into the parking lot for this location. When I called the store and calmly and politely spoke to manager on duty to express my concern, his initial response was to say that there was nothing he could really do and to ask me if I would call the cops if this were any other driver.  Which COMPLETELY misses the point. I will NEVER do business with this establishment and will be sharing this information with our neighborhood news board to encourage my neighbors to take their business elsewhere."}
{"text":"Ordered their wings again, this time they did not disappoint. They were as good as I remember them and I was reminded of why dominos is the only place I ever ordered wings from. Tender meat covered in buffalo sauce. In comparison to the last time I ordered, it was a complete turn around; the pieces were not small or with little meat and they were not dry or bland in taste. This is why dominos has always been my favorite place for wings.    Their wings are not as good as I remembered them, they lacked buffalo sauce and the wings themselves had too much fat on them. This used to be my favorite place for wings, but I doubt I will be getting them again. Also when I picked up my order, the cashier couldn't figure out out much to give me back and he was short on the change... But I let that go. Just saying, if you're a cashier, you should be able to give the right change back. Other than that, when I ordered my food, the man on the phone made it easy and was friendly."}
{"text":"I hadn't had Dominoes in many years, but my husband and I were intrigued by their \"we've slowed things down\" ad campaign. We were so happy with the experience! Dominoes did a really nice job revamping their pizza. The crust has a lovely garlic flavor and the price for carryout is amazing!"}
{"text":"i use the domino's tracker all the time and the same person makes my pizza... corey!!!!!!111!!!1!1!1!!1 bombaf gg 10/10 would recommend"}
{"text":"This Dominos is a raging joke, I ordered an extra large pizza with pepperoni and bacon and half jalepeno.  I was in a hurry, figure 50% off was a great deal and went for it.  The delivery took over an hour and a half and when I got the pizza, it not only looked like a frozen pizza I would buy from the store and microwave, but it was freezing cold.  We all tried one slice and thought it was the most disgusting thing we've ever tasted.  But like I said, we were in a hurry.  So we got ready and left, by the time we got home, dominos was already closed, so I called the next day to complain and asked if they could replace my order and offered them the practically full pizza from the night before as proof that it was not eaten and look like roadkill.  They had the audacity to ask me why it took so long to call them....like the food got worse the longer I took to call, when I explained to them that I had places to go and that I wouldn't have wanted the same person remaking my pizza, nor the same person that took an hour and a half to deliver it, they told me that they would remake me a LARGE pizza and that it would only be PEPPERONI!!  I told them that was fine but laughed because it was BS, they said if I would have called the night before it would have been different, but since I waited a day, this is what I get.  LMAO, this is what I get for them making crap pizzas, I forgot that I was my fault they failed a customer!!!  The owners there are complete jokes and penny pinchers, they could care less about the quality of your food and if you complain, they will argue with you about your complaint!  I know how much a pizza is, I used to work for a higher quality pizza hut, and know that it costs the company next to nothing to make you a free replacement pizza.  Dominos pizza costs less to make than Pizza Hut and yet this unbelievable A-hole thinks he was being slick..... too bad I USED to order from them all of the time, and this little incident will show no more of my money going into their pockets!!!! And to top things off, the replacement pizza tasted even worse than the original pizza!!!"}
{"text":"I know that all Domino's strive for consistency in their products and service, but this particular location stands above most. They are always fresh and hot. Kudos to the 3875 W Ray Road Chandler, AZ 85224 location. YOU GUYS ROCK"}
{"text":"Yo, this shit was amazing. Domino's is my shit, and the fact that they deliver so late is even better when you drunk as heeeeelllll."}
{"text":"Ordered twice from the Dominos iphone app for delivery, both times the order arrived with missing items and less than the order qty of boneless chicken wings. The driver came back with the sauces but the manager refused to deal with the obvious quantity issue... An 8 pc wings order cant have 6 pieces... 3 of which were smaller than a quarter."}
{"text":"Horrible customer service on the phone they want to rush you off when you go pick up the food there's rude people there . The two pizzas and the lava cake that I ordered the pizzas were just thrown on toppings burnt cheese and lava cake was overdone just terrible. Not going back to that dominos."}
{"text":"This is my go to cheat food.  Dominos used to be garbage pizza but since they did their company makeover a few years back they have really stepped it up. The thin crust is awesome and they are not stingy with the toppings.  4 stars instead of 5 because I wish the delivery could get it to me a little bit more hot but I think I'm just whining at this point.  Great delivery pizza."}
{"text":"Ordered pizza from this dominos which is not bad over all, however when ordering delivery from this location, make sure to plan your meal 2 hours in advance. Not the greatest service from all the staff either."}
{"text":"Ok...so normally I don't personally like ordering pizza from these kind of chains, so I was a little worried when the hubby suggested it. I went with it, because let's get real we were exhausted from our busy day and well they deliver so bingo that's how we came to this conclusion. Also he doesn't like Pizza Hut and the Papa Johns by us always burns the crust. So we ordered online because my ex - sister in law used to live to watch the online tracking, and I wanted to see what the big deal was. We ordered a pan pizza, extra cheese and pepperoni and of course I have to have dessert so I ordered the cinnamon stixs. I loved the online status, that was fun to keep track of my order. But let me get to the food because that's what I'm supposed to rating. My pizza was delivered by a super kind gentleman who had everything waiting for me for sign...and I don't mean he has a clip board and is balancing it in an awkward exchange. I mean one hand had the clipboard with the pen in perfect position for me to just add my Johnny handcock and grab my pizza, the exchange that normally take anywhere from 1-3min took less than 1. As soon as I felt that pizza box, I knew good things were about to happen. My pizza literally felt like it was right out of the oven, and so did my cinnamon stixs. My pizza came exactly how ordered, which most would say should be no big deal, but please I've gotten it wrong plenty of times....and that means that extra cheese was for real extra cheese all up on that pie. I have never had such good domino's, like, ever. I finished the couple of slices and moved on to dessert cause that's the kind of person I am always ready for sweetness. That too was fantastic, warm like it had come out of grandma's oven and was cooling on a rack while you ate dinner and the dipping sauce really set it off. Overall I am super satisfied with it all: the customer service, food temperature, and most of all taste. Big thumbs up."}
{"text":"Very bad service . Did a phone order for delivery and they took over an hour to complete n deliver my order . On top  of that I asked for plates they didn't have any , but after they delivered i still tipped the driver I mean maybe all this wasn't his fault figured he just delivers . When I get to my room and check my order they forgot to put my dips in which I paid extra for. Very dissatisfied!"}
{"text":"First off pizza was late. Second off Mark gives me the pizza I give him his tip. Then he ask if he could see the card that I use for online I didn't realize I needed it i've never been asked for before I simply told him that my wife stepped out. He told me that he couldn't give me the pizza which I understand rules are rules. But what pissed me off was I told him I want to my tip  back and he told me that he couldn't give it back. Will never order from this place again."}
{"text":"So its Friday and I work hard all week and it has been a thing for the last month or two to have pizza every friday night and the kids love it Well needless to say I haven't had Domino's in quite some time so I downloaded the app to order a pizza for pick up which didn't work so I ended up having to call to get the price of the quoted special for the pizza. When I pulled up I noticed the bar next door and there was loud people and smoking and sounded like a few guys arguing so definitely not a place you want to take your kids for picking up pizza. The pizza was the main reason for the trip to Domino's especially since it's a few blocks from my house so why pay the extra 5 to 6 dollars for delivery. We got the 2 medium 2 topping pizzas and 16 parmesan bread bites the pizza had hardly any sauce and the crust was really greasy like they slapped too much of the butter flavor on it and wasn't all to appetizing as a family we can eat 2 medium pizzas no problem especially being that we have hungry kids but there is still a whole pizza left over rare for our family on pizza night. The bread bites didn't come with sauce so I paid the extra 75 cents for a cup of the most awful tasting marinara sauce and the bites were greasy and so salty it was hardly edible. So on a fair note being that the cheese was the only thing good about the pizza give this Domino's 2 stars and I won't be going back probably for another year or so just to remind myself why we never order from Domino's."}
{"text":"Good. Pizza is great and service is always great. Order on-line and you get a little flash media surprise!"}
{"text":"Since I moved to this neighborhood a year ago this Domino's Pizza has been consistently a great pizza delivery!! They are always fast and the pizza has always been hot and fresh, whether I order for lunch, dinner, or even late night on the weekends. Only had one mix up with a brand new driver (his first night) when I first moved in, but they sent out the correct order, and gave me credit for a future order. Ashley was the manager on duty that night... she was very professional and actually corrected the mistake before I even noticed it was a mix up and called her... by the time I had hung up the phone, the new corrected order was at my door. So, all in all this Domino's Pizza really impresses me . I highly recommend."}
{"text":"I love these guys.  Fast, accurate and courteous delivery and in store."}
{"text":"I received horribly cut cold pizza. My cinnamon sticks were cold. All of my food was cold. I asked for root beer but they brought me Dr pepper. My food took an hour to come because they had the wrong number which I can understand. But I was told they would remake my pizza but I'm certain they sent me the old food. Very unhappy. One star is generous."}
{"text":"I ordered a philly cheese steak sandwich with NO green peppers. My order was placed online. When I got my sandwich, it had green peppers on it. Apparently someone can't read???"}
{"text":"First and foremost, when they answer they are on point with taking and delivering orders. But honestly I called them and hour before closing time 6 times. You know what I got NOTHING !!!! Automated but here's the catch to the whole mess. I called dominoes on university and boom. They answered can you believe that! Holy crap..... So what exact excuse does someone off of Dobson have? Please don't tell me your backed up because university was still hard at work at 1:10 in the morning! You lazy pricks. I'm usually not so nice in words!!! Hate your job??? THEN QUIT."}
{"text":"Have ordered at least 8 times in the past year from this 19th Avenue and Dunlap location. We have had great success with all of the products received-always hot or very warm and fresh. Only once did we have some severe problems with placing the order online and then waiting about an hour before discovering we were lost in the system. To prevent this from happening, we contact the local store after placing the order online-just to make certain we're waiting on a pizza delivery for tonight and not for the next day. All of the pizzas have been cooked to our order, almost always we're requesting a well done crust (for pan pizza) and they fulfill our requests. I'm not thrilled with the charges that you don't think of ahead of time, delivery and taxes, etc. When you're on a budget and utilizing a coupon, don't forget to take into consideration the taxes, charge for delivery and the tip. We tip at 20 percent and more if appropriate. Twice the pizza was delivered by a young female driver who brought us napkins and a delightful smile and personality. It was so welcomed as we're cooped up in a hotel suite almost all the time. Thanks for great pizza, wings, bread sticks and special requests. Only problem has been ordering online and having issues with coupons not working (when they should) or having orders lost in computer space. Medium Salad at $4.99 is one of smallest in business around here. As a salad eater, this is disappointing but they are known for pizza. They offer a Chicken Cesar Salad (Bigger and with Chicken, etc) for same price so that's the route to go. Would love to have my greens tonight but the $4.99 is far too much for very small side salad with nothing special at all on it.Otherwise, we would have given 4.5 stars to this very busy location. We're told it's one of the busiest in the country and often we have our delivery within 25 minutes."}
{"text":"Good food, great service, fast delivery, God prices, and pleasant employees in the store and delivery orders!! Good menu variety and we love the online ordering app!!"}
{"text":"Ordered twice from here, both times they forgot the ranch I ordered (very important condiment) and the second time took an hour to get my pizza. I live 12 miles away."}
{"text":"Received a very burnt pizza on top and bottom. The pizza was inedible. When I called to complain, the employee told me that is how Domino's makes their pizzas. I guess it's back to Pizza Hut and Papa John's for my family and I. I would not recommend this place to anyone. Hopefully I can save you your $20, cause I know I won't get mine back."}
{"text":"Didn't see the poor reviews until after I ordered. Don't waist your time with this place. Ordered online for pickup. Website said 13-18 minutes.  50 minutes after I ordered FOR CARRY OUT. My order was ready.  Never again. Will go back to hungry howies that I usually go to and drive past to get here.  I'd give this place no stars if it was an option."}
{"text":"The pizza has no flavor. It tastes like dough and sauce. Nothing special at all. It doesn't even have a smell unless you count box . it just looks good. Might want to think about adding some herbs and spices or something"}
{"text":"The service was TERRIBLE!!!!! Watch out for this store if your kids are Hungry!!! When I arrived no one  had ANY idea what was going on. I had to tell them what I had ordered even after they found my name in the system. Then they told me the order was still not done and it would still going be AWHILE, they could not even tell me in minutes how much longer. Mind you! This is after I had  ordered online from home-waited 15 minutes to leave, driving there for ten minutes and waiting another ten after I paid them. Seeing all the chaos I had enough and  decided to go some where else to get my family some food. I asked for my money back BUT since I had paid with my debit card when I arrived they informed me that it would take 10 to 15 business days to get my money back. Haven't been this MAD over pizza since I was a child.....    This place does not deserve one star..."}
{"text":"Took over 1.5 hours to receive a delivery on wings, and they are not answering their phone."}
{"text":"I had quit ordering from Domino's years ago but decided to give them a try one more time,never again....... One pizza I ordered was with extra cheese and it looks just like the one without the extra. A $40.00 order and all I got was mostly bread....At least the delivery person was nice. Tried a No star rating but it doesn't allow it. Major FAIL!!!!"}
{"text":"I place an order askind for jalapeñes only on half of my pizza, when they delivery it was full of jalapeños.   My husband call and ask to talk to a manager she said that she made the pizza her self and that apperantly they can NOT put only an ingredient on half of a pizza. We know for a fact that it can be done because we always place orders with half jalapeños for the kids.  She answer in a very rude way.  Then we call back and placed an other order by phone and 20 min later they call to make sure the order was legit."}
{"text":"I'm so glad I ordered a pizza to avoid cooking dinner to have to come home and put this raw doughy pizza in the oven. I haven't had dominos in years and definitely won't again this was terrible. Apparently I have to also give a star just know you don't deserve it."}
{"text":"Pizza is as pizza does. Good for those pizza cravings. Pick up specials are nice & el cheapo. Go in there expecting hot pizza & you'll be pleased. We've been eating their piping hot globs of carbs, sauce & cheese for the past four years & don't plan to stop. Online ordering is a snap."}
{"text":"There was a lovely girl (Dimpi) and another employee (Meet), that went above and beyond for me and my boyfriend by making a delicious pizza, fast when the store was very close to closing time. I really appreciated it, and all the delivery drivers were very friendly and funny too. Great location with great employees! Will order from there again."}
{"text":"Customer service was super bad. The pizza was cold by the time they delivered it to me."}
{"text":"I'm pretty easy going and understanding but these guys ruined my dinner. I did a carry out and received a pizza that was obviously not fresh. Normally this wouldn't bug me but they made a point of telling me it was fresh out of the oven. Dirtbags"}
{"text":"I know.  It's just Domino's.  But something is different.  This is not the Domino's that delivered to my freshman dorms.  The thin crust veggie is addictive!"}
{"text":"This Domino's location is awesome! Everytime I get a pizza here it is warm, delicious and the crust is nice and fluffy. Other locations in the area have been disappointing.   No experience with the employees or service. The pizza is great though!"}
{"text":"Normally I like Domino's. I placed an order online (because I love the tracker) on Saturday afternoon around 3:30. The tracker informed me that my food was done around 345. Now this store is a 7 minute drive from my house. The driver left at 402...and by 445 still hadn't arrived. I called the store to see what was going on, and the person who answered the phone curtly told me he'd call the drive and then HUNG UP ON ME. The drive arrived about 10 minutes later...with my COLD pizza, sub, and chicken. And got disgusted because I didn't tip him. I am calling management after I write this review because the whole thing is unacceptable. Again, I like Dominos, but I won't be giving anymore money to this particular store."}
{"text":"Delivery time is pretty good. Pizza is ok but not great. The wings are NEVER good. Always burnt."}
{"text":"Ordered salad, wings, and 20 oz dr pepper. 2 things : the wings were bad this time. The meat was guey/melty/rubberie consistinsy and there was hardly any sauce on the meat, most of the sauce (barely any sauce in the entire box of wings) was on the bottom of the tin foil. Also, the person who handed me my food nearly forgot my drink and when I reminded them of it. He handed me the two liter, I had to correct him that I ordered the 20 oz. Otherwise the salad was the best thing in my 17 dollar order."}
{"text":"Yum yum yum yum. Got a hand tossed pan pizza with chicken bacon and bar b q sauce I'm never eating any other pizza from anywhere. Eat it. Ice cold drinks and a fast delivery parmasean bread sticks were really good as well. Tried the cinnamon twists there pretty rich but good. Happy customer"}
{"text":"Doesn't deserve three stars. They're on time courteous and I understand there pizza isn't the best, there employees are."}
{"text":"Wanted to order online, placed my order and went to checkout.  Asked for my name email etc...it stated to sign in or continue as guest, so I didn't provide that info.  Wouldn't let me checkout until i provided that info.  If I'm paying at the store, and picking it up, you don't need that info, so I didn't order from you"}
{"text":"This place may have had the worst service I've ever received in any sort of business. I would rather deal with cable company customer service on a daily basis than attempt to give this place my business ever again.   I ordered pizza at 10:48pm on 02/27/2016 and was told it would be delivered in \"25-30 minutes\" Okay great... we finished up our drinks at the hotel bar and headed up to the room to wait for the food. After an hour wait I called back to check the status and was assured \"oh your order just left and will be there any minute\". The hotel is 0.5 miles from this location. Okay... at this point I'm irritated but whatever, i'm hungry too. 30 mins later (90 mins since the original call) I still have no pizza. I call back again and I'm told the exact same thing \"oh your order just left and will be there any minute\". At this point I questioned the so called manager why I was being told this again... and again... and again.... When I asked if he had any idea when my pizza would be there and why I was told an hour ago it was on the way he apologized for just giving me the same answer both times and said \"they got busy\". I'm not an impatient person at all... If he said it would be over an hour originally then I would have waited and not said a word. I don't like being lied to or disrespected which I felt happened several times during my encounter. I come to Pittsburgh frequently and will never again attempt to give this place my business. A lesson in customer service 101 may be beneficial."}
{"text":"Very inconsistent, but overall very low quality. Sometimes it's like they just slid it through the oven it's so undercooked, other times just thrown in the box. They're open late, that's about the only positive."}
{"text":"DO NOT ORDER FROM HERE!!!   I called back to complain about a pizza that was burnt and in eattable.   I asked for the manager and when he got on the phone as I always do I asked him for his name.  He told me that he wouldn't tell me and to respect him.    I tried to explain my reason why I was calling but he was still talking.  Wouldn't stop talking until I told home to stop.  Then he turned to telling me to \"Fuck Off\" multiple times.   Customers service is number one to me being in a customers based business and deal with hundreds of people every day. This is totally disrespect to a customers and I want everyone to know not to order from Dominos anymore!"}
{"text":"Great price deals, fast service and delivery, accurate orders, friendly drivers, and an easy to use online ordering system."}
{"text":"Took over 90 minutes to deliver cold food from high park and dundas to Keele and Anette.  For the delay they offered $10 off coupon, for the cold food they wouldn't compensate.  Never again."}
{"text":"Called to order a large pizza.  Called back 5 minutes later to order dipping sauce.  Our sauce did not come with our order.  The order was $16 and the driver did not have change for our $20 bill.  After complaining went to his car and brought back $1.50.  I did not know I as required to tip my Domino's driver who didn't even bring our full order and expected a $4 tip,  Will not be ordering from Domino's again.  I called the driver back and he hung up on me.  Incredibly poor service."}
{"text":"Used to really love dominos, but this location has me officially done with them. Hardly any cheese on the pizza, all bread and the taste of sauce and toppings. Figured the first time we ordered it was a fluke but now it's consistent. Not sure if it's an ordering scheme where you have to ordee extra cheese and they give you the true amount, but that's not worth it. When I picked up my order and took it home there was no sauce even though I paid extra, have also had the wrong item given in place of cheese bread. I'll be ordering pizza from somewhere else from here on out."}
{"text":"Please don't order here, or be very careful when you do, this was the only thing I had time to eat yesterday and I woke up today with horrific food poisoning. I'm one hundred percent positive,  as it's all I had to eat in the time frame of this food poisoning. Obviously, I'm not very happy with the food."}
{"text":"Ordered online, because it should be that easy. An hour later, order shows in tracker that it's been delivered. So we wait another 1/2 hour and then i call the store to be told, \"we are really busy and the order is on it's way\". Wait another 10 minutes, call the store and ask for manager and told that she is really busy, what do I need? I ask for manager again and some girl named \"precious\" tells me she is the manager and is really busy, nothing she can do. Called back and asked for district manager number and get some Dave guy who tells me he is the store manager and is at home and can't believe that his Asst manager would be rude. Ask for district manager and get some Steve Sharp name and number, call leave message and nothing... Oh btw, my order has been cancelled, don't need some food spit in or God knows what else showing up on my door 3 hours later! Not ordering from this ridiculous excuse of a business again!"}
{"text":"Oh my god this place is a friggen joke. Placed an order for an XL pizza and pound of wings at 12am; I called them at 1am to see where our pizza was at; the manager said, \"Our delivery driver said he already delivered the pizza and that the person at the door said they already got their order, so he came back to the store.\" They never called us saying they got here. So the manager apologized and said they were sending out a fresh new pizza ASAP. The delivery guy came at 1:25am, with an attitude. I asked who he spoke to when he allegedly came to our apartment building, and he said it was a different driver. Not only did we have to pay for our pizza, but when we got it, it was cold, cheese was congealed and wings were soggy. They're idiots; they left the time stamp on the pizza, sure enough, it was marked 12am which is when we placed our order. So they brought us our original pizza that had been sitting there for an hour and a half. When we called to complain, he said he would give us 50% off our next order. Yeah right, we are never ordering from this Dominos again. The manager does not care about customers. They were closing up and didn't want to make a new pizza for us. He was hardly apologetic and very rude. And ended the convo with, \"well whatever then, bye.\". Needless to say, I don't recommend ordering food online and for delivery. In person or pick up might be a different story but don't expect any customer service whatsoever. Will be sending a huge complaint with pictures to corporate."}
{"text":"I wasn't really feeling like dining in at a restaurant so I opted for Domino's instead. I got the 2 or more deal for $7.99. I ordered a pan pizza with mushrooms and some wings for my boyfriend. The pizza was really good. The pan pizza tasted similar to Pizza Hut's crust; it was oily, greasy, and delicious. The wings were a let down. We asked for them to be tossed in hot sauce, but it was barely tossed properly and not spicy and all."}
{"text":"Well for one they dont answer there phones in a timely manner, the delivery drive called to let me know that the internet did not charge me for the sauce for my bites, i kindly said ill add enough to the tip for them to take it out. He snapped back at with me with \" well if your going to be like that dont bother tipping me\" poor service ! Im scared to even recieve my food"}
{"text":"I will never order from this location again!  Ever!  I placed my order online and they charged my credit card and the confirmation email states they would be here in 25-37 min.  It has now been over an hour and 22 min.  And now of course when I try and call they don't answer because the store is closed.  So they have my money and my food and I have nothing!  Thieves is what they are! Thankfully I can dispute with my credit card company and get the money back. Avoid this location especially at night unless you want your money stolen like mine."}
{"text":"ZERO STARS!!!!! (But Yelp made me give them one!!!) Stars do NOT apply to this sorry excuse of a delivery service. Tonight is the 2nd time we've ordered pizza from this location.  The first time it took 2.5 hours and was cold and nasty; they said they would not charge the account and did any way. Tonight it was an HOUR + 15 minutes. Both times we had to call and remind them over the order.   When I asked the guy how long ago he left the shop, (4 miles away) he said, \"10 minutes ago.\"  Well, he might be right, but the pizza has clearly been sitting in the box longer than that!  When I tried to call and say I have a complaint, not an order, they hung up.  Clearly the folks in charge don't care. Two strikes, you're OUT, I will not let the kid order from this location again! For those of you who want to deliver for this place I highly recommend you think twice about it.  No tips for pizza's advertised for 30 minutes and they take 2-5 times that amount of time, and they're cold."}
{"text":"Slow, lacking in customer service training, not a positive experience. My order of one pizza and one side took over an hour despite being told it would be a 20 minute wait. At least 3-4 other customers were complaining and asking for the manager. I followed up on my order (politely - I tried to be fair) only to be brushed off twice. By the third time (after a 50+ minute wait), I gave in and asked for my money back. The cashier relented and pulled up the wrong order, which was less expensive than my actual order, and tried to insist he gave me the correct refund. Finally, the cashier who took my order stepped in and found my actual order and gave me back the full amount. Not sure I will be back even though this location is less than 5 minutes from my house."}
{"text":"Great job always keeping us happy...WAY BETTER than Pizza Hut...always improving...thank you for your service!"}
{"text":"The foods great, always get my orders correct only problem waiting for your order to be done other then that I like it"}
{"text":"Have purchased dinner from here a few times - the orders wereaccurate, food was hot and deliveries arrived quickly! Surprisingly -- the chicken was very very good. It is an inexpensive alternative to the other (rather extortionate)  pizza places in the neighborhood. Love that I can order online - no phone calls on hold, spelling my name a million times, barking my credit card number. It is all a seamless process -- that ends with a decent meal! Keep up the great work!"}
{"text":"Domino's in terms of quality is usually better than the other chains. Their prices however are usually higher. THere's a Pizza Pizza in Meadowvale Town Centre and a place called Pizza Hot Pizza on 10th line/Aquitane and a 241 Pizza nearby and they're all better but if you want good pizza and good sides like cheesy sticks then this is better. Btw, they do usually have walk-in specials like $11-12 for a 1 topping large which doesn't show up on their site.  This location seems a bit more professional, also renovated on the inside and their pizza I find is better than the Heartland location.  So overall, it's nothing special but compared to the other avg cardboard tasting pizzas in Mississauga, it deserves a 4 star review."}
{"text":"I had a great experience at dominoes yesterday. Awesome customer service. I ordered the pizza and they put it in the oven before I paid. The cashier slid my card and it was denied, I had no idea why and I didn't have any other way to pay, later finding out I had to activate a new card.  They gave me the pizza anyway, instead of throwing it out. The cashier was just being very nice and polite saying it could have been a store issue. Anyway, I'll definitely be coming back to this one and also pay them back."}
{"text":"I used a special coupon for a large pizza and pop for $9.99 and after being so used to Pizza Pizza, this was a delightful change. Their delivery is a bit slow though, but their pizza is awesome. Though maybe my palate may just be under trained."}
{"text":"Ordered a pizza online at 4:30PM. Online pizza tracker said it was on Step 4 Quality Check at 4:49PM, by 5:09, it still hadn't moved. I called Dominos and asked what was going on, and the employee told me that it would be an additional 45-60 minutes because they're \"too busy\". Ridiculous. It's true that this was on a Friday night; however, if they're rushed, they should adjust pizza preparation so that pizza won't be cold when delivered.  I called again two minutes later to ask to speak to the manager and was told that the pizza was now on its way. Pizza did finally get here at 5:24. However, as was expected, it was lukewarm.   I love Domino's pizza but after this experience, we will not be ordering pizza from this location in the future. I recommend that you do not, either. This is not the first time that we've had a negative experience with this shop. When we first moved into our apartment, we ordered pizza at 11:00pm after spending all day moving furniture into the apartment. You'd think that at this time of night, we'd be able to get the pizza in a timely manner... nope. Didn't get here til 1:30AM! :("}
{"text":"New specialty chicken was really good. The thin crust pizza I ordered was amazing and the service was exceptional. Much more cheerful than last time."}
{"text":"I ordered here today and had the best delivered Pizza I have ever had!It didn't even taste like the regular tasteless pizza you would get normally from a Franchise."}
{"text":"Pizza Never Delivered!!!!  I called an ordered pizza for me and my 10 year old son.  Gave them my CC number over the phone (which they ran).  They told me my pizza would be delivered within 45 minutes.  1-1/2 hours later, I call to check the status.  It is Friday night and I assume they are hammered.  The girl who answers the phone says she can't find an order for me.  After, I insist...she puts me on hold, comes back and said they had called to confirm my $20 dollar order, and that this is policy (so I haven't order a $20 pizza with a stolen credit card) and that I had not answered so they did not deliver......I order from this Dominos all the time.  They never call to confirm..  They did not call this time to confirm.  VERY DISAPPOINTED."}
{"text":"I have to agree with Kat's review.  Reading the review made me crave Dominos and I broke down tonight.  The delivery was pretty quick and I think I had the exact same eccentric delivery guy.  The biggest plus is paying the extra dollar for the \"deep dish\" crust which is super tasty and almost like combining the bread sticks with the pizza in one \"franken-zza\"."}
{"text":"I would give zero stars if possible.  My pizza took one hour ten minutes to travel half a mile, despite an estimated delivery time of 22-33 minutes.  My pizza was finished after 20 minutes according to the pizza tracker, delivered ice cold 50 minutes later.  I would go any where else."}
{"text":"Fuck this place. The pizza is not worth the time, we have (mistakenly so) ordered from them multiple times, and at least 3 of these, they took over double the time, one time they knocked at 3:30am, when we ordered at 12. Oh and they refuse to give a refund or explanation, just say that the tracker may have been wrong"}
{"text":"I have called to place an order 3 times only to be told they can't do it.   1st time- it was too late (called 45 mins before close)  2nd time- they only take cash passed a certain time. A much more feasible excuse.    This most recent time is the most ridiculous.   I was told I can't have food delivered there because I live in the same city as that Papa John's. Yeah, you read that right. I live less than 5 mins from this poor excuse for a pizza place and they can't deliver it to me.   Avoid this place if you can."}
{"text":"UPDATE : second pie this week, not once disappointed , quick ordering takes seconds I recommend double sausage and beef thin an crispy."}
{"text":"There are definitely some employees who make pizza way better than others but they're always quick and delicious nonetheless"}
{"text":"Wow, not only will I never eat Domino's again (and this was our first time in many years!), I don't think I'll be able to eat pizza AT ALL for a long time.  I thought it was an olive hiding under my pepporoni, and fortunately I hate olives so I started to pick it out with a fork.  Well, not an olive but a cockroach!!"}
{"text":"I used to order from here frequently, however I chose to find my pizza elsewhere. On several occasions they have not delivered what I've ordered and when I call to complain they have just said \"too bad, what do you want us to do?\"  The last driver didn't even have change and expected me to just give him a very large tip!? With so many options for takeout I'll spend my hard earned money elsewhere"}
{"text":"We just moved to Las Vegas from Los Angeles, and after a couple weeks of fine dining, we decided to go for one of our favorite comfort foods - Dominos pizza.  Unfortunately, what was our regular order for years and years in LA is inconceivable to the folks at our new local Dominos.    The manager literally called us up to argue with us about our order.  That it had too many toppings, that it wouldn't cook right, that we were manipulating the system (by asking for 4 substitutions on on an Extravaganzza), and that our order was so complicated it would confuse their cooks.  I'm sorry, but if your employees can't handle 4 substitutions or cook a pizza with 8 toppings, then maybe they shouldn't be working for Dominos.  And quite frankly, neither should this manager for calling us up and arguing with us about our order instead of making sure he has his sh*t together at his store.  Piss poor customer service.  Never ordering from here again.  Probably a good thing, will save them a lot of confusion."}
{"text":"So I actually really like their pizza. We order online and it's really convenient. BUT, they never bring our sauces. We typically order 4 to 6 extra sauces that we pay for. Over and over we call and complain and they blame it on the system. We ask the driver when he brings it and he says it wasn't on the ticket when we can see it on the side of the box. All I ever hear is excuses and no one seems to want to rectify the situation. So, if you don't want anything extra with your pizza, you'll probably be fine, but good luck getting  your complete order that you pay for."}
{"text":"Completely pissed off with the 9310 s eastern location. The guy that I initially ordered from was completely nice but then it just went downhill from there. I sat there and waited over 20 minutes (when they weren't even busy) and watched them mess up one lady's order, watched the person that was MAKING the pizzas dig a piece paper out of the trash, watched another person eat freaking pringles by the pizza toaster thing and listened to them complain and talk crap about this stupid write up that one of them got. I have no problem with them talking and having fun and whatever but not talking about work problems in front of customers when they have been waiting for a while. After I finally got my food I find that they did not put the extra garlic butter sauce on the crust that I asked for, so I went back in and asked for more. The guy who was there then handed me the bottle and asked if I wanted to do it myself. Seriously? Rudest staff ever. My pizza now looks like someone jizzed on it because the butter sauce didn't even melt after I complained about that they said it would take time to melt they didn't even bother to offer heating it up. I tried eating it thinking it would taste better than it looks. I was seriously wrong. This is why you do not hire immature high schoolers who are not willing to do their job. Only reason I gave two stars because this location is usually nice but the staff tonight sucked a$$."}
{"text":"I wish I could put negative star. The worst experience ever. Not even worth my time to write about the details."}
{"text":"Delivery time was amazingly quick. Pizza was good, and hot. Drunk food never tasted soooo good! Delivery guy was actually quite nice, and normal looking. I had to speak to the manager because 1-800 dominos couldn't figure out where i lived. He was very nice, and sounded sexy! I kinda wished he'd delivered my pizza....  Trust me. You don't want to miss the Philly Cheese Steak pizza. It's delicious!"}
{"text":"As far as a dominoes goes its as good as you can get.  Good staff, and the remodeling last year lets your kids watch the pizza being made. Weekdays you can usually get a deal that competes with their competitor, sure it might be a dollar more, but its worth it. They still have parmesan!"}
{"text":"We have gotten the pizza for $7.99 before and had no issues, however, this Saturday (May 2, 2015) we ordered a pan pizza for $22+.   As a result, we will never order pizza from this store again.  The manager that I spoke to about the 45 minute late delivery and the fact that our pizza dough wasn't even cooked, was rude and tried to put the blame on me by saying \"You need to order it well done\". (Shelby)  Well, I don't want pizza dough well done - I DO want it fully cooked, however, and not yucky and doughy!  I also would have appreciated a phone call about the late delivery, but that wasn't done, either.  I did get my money back, but I will NEVER go to this store again.  I can also tell from past reviews that Shelby has issues.  Surprising that she is still employed!"}
{"text":"The staff is always on the ball and friendly.   The only time I've ever had a lengthy wait was on Super Bowl weekend and another high-traffic time.  Always accurate, always friendly!"}
{"text":"The restaurant was relatively clean. The service was nonexistent. Then I get home with my pizza and what do I find. A friggin hair in my pizza. When I saw no hairnets in use at the prep table, I got nervous. But to actually find a long brunette hair when I am a bald bachelor is inexcusable.   Signed,   I'm going back to Fuel Pizza"}
{"text":"Placed ordered - took over a hour to arrive. Manager hung up when calling to receive status. Food was cold when arrived. Will never order from this location."}
{"text":"Never order from this location. My family has ordered previously and had no problems. BUT recently it has completely gone downhill. For the past two attempts, our pizza has never been prepared correctly. Always something ingredients missing! Today was the 3rd and final strike. Ordered 3 medium pizzas: first was missing something. Second(fiery Hawaiian style) was missing the fiery sauce and jalapeños. And our third pizza was barely sauced and missing cheese on two whole slices. AND then they even forgot our beverage. This location is just a complete mess. Never ordering from here again!"}
{"text":"First & last time I order from this Dominoes. Our pizzas were made promptly, however my 2 topping pizza was burnt on the edges & toppings were incredibly skimpy including the mozzarella cheese! The other 2 topping left the box so greasy it soaked through the box & on the seat of my car. Top it all off, when I asked for Parmesan cheese, I was told I could PURCHASE it for a dollar something! No thanks. I'll take my business to the many other pizza places nearby."}
{"text":"I love Dominos. To have a franchise offer such poor service and food quality is a disservice to the name.  This is my local store and I've ordered 10+ times since moving to Pittsburgh. Each time I remained optimistic. Each time I said, \"next time it will be better.\" Today was the last straw. It took this store 2 hours to deliver my food when the estimate was 38 minutes. When the food did arrive it was cold, so much so I had to reheat it in my oven for the cheese to get semi-solid again.   I called the Manager, Latevi. He was rude, non-responsive, and condescending. He didn't offer to replace the offer and actually told me I can't expect to have my food on my time.   This establishment is a disgrace to the Domino's brand."}
{"text":"cant deliver to hotel room for someone who needs assistance and got an attitude when i asked why since all other dominos do. even more attitude and cut off when asked to just cancel order. super disappointing..."}
{"text":"I love cooking and rarely eat out or order in. But was working on a project this weekend and saw an ad for Domino's 50% off any pie, anything you want on it. Ordered one on Saturday, loaded with toppings (pepperoni, mushrooms, peppers, onions, extra cheese, marinara instead of regular sauce).  I probably hadn't had Domino's pizza in like 15 years, for real; but it was so good, so easy to order online and fast delivery with hot pizza. I did the same on Sunday, it was a double-dip of Domino's for me this weekend.  If I ever do have pizza, I usually like to eat-in at the parlor.  But this pie was nice and hot, not one you'd have to put in the microwave a slice at a time to reheat.  So the East Liberty Domino's on Sheridan gets full stars from me.  If you're like me, and haven't tried them in a while, you will immediately know that they have made a lot of smart changes in their operations and offerings."}
{"text":"I've ordered from this place both online and in person, carry out and delivery. Now there are times when they got my order right, but the times that they got my order wrong was more then enough for me to just pay a little more for delivery from papa john's.  Multiple times they got my order for a pasta bread bowl wrong. I order chicken Alfredo bread bowls from them a lot because when I was enlisted they always made that just as I had asked. But for some reason this dominos doesn't seem to know how to make them. Multiple times they undercooked it, I sometimes got a big bread bowl and other times I got a bread bowl that was tiny. Just recently I ordered a bread bowl with extra chicken, what I got was a 1 chicken, and a lot of alfredo. I am by no means a vegan, so why do I get 1 piece of chicken when I ordered extra chicken?  Their pizza is also greasy like a mofo. When you order wings that are not spicy, you get mild wings ( for some, people don't care but you ordered it a specific way).  Overall, if you want pizza, order elsewhere. They give you what they want to give you, not what you ordered."}
{"text":"Every Monday Dominos has a 50% off coupon, so I take advantage of it. Usually it's 1 large all dressed and 1 large triple cheese with pepperoni, with bottles of Sprite. The first time I did this, the delivery driver walks down my corridor to my apt, gives me a non stop dirty look; I gave him a decent tip, went into my apt, and heard him muttering and cursing as he walked off.  The pizzas were cooked properly, as I requested.  I've ordered on Mondays 2 pizzas around 7 times now; that first driver has never returned here. If he did and gave me attitude I'd file a formal complaint with Dominos and if he wouldn't get fired I'd go to the Human Rights Commission. No one needs that garbage.  Each delivery driver after that was polite, friendly and had a nice smile.  As someone else remarked, PizzaPizza is low end crappy pizza. I've had too many issues with Mike's in the past where they sent me reheated pizza so it's been years since I ordered from them.  The pizzas are fine, the soft drinks come cold.  So no complaints other than that first scumbag delivery driver.  Today I find out the location is moving and I can't order from them due to a 2 week closure. I don't know where they are relocating, so I had to order from the resto by Atwater Market; I had to put in that I'd pick it up, then I called to give them my address and they delivered.  Unfortunately instead of sending me Sprite they sent Coke which I won't drink. Driver had to return, get the Sprite, come back. Took him 15 minutes, apologized several times, stayed friendly."}
{"text":"I have ordered from this Dominos for over 3 years and have had hit or miss service from them, but after today I will no longer be ordering from them. Today I ordered a pizza at 3:27pm. At 4:05 I called the store to inquire as to where my pizza might be as it was already 40minutes late. Before I could get the sentence out of my mouth the man who answered cut me off to say \"it's on its way - it should be there any minute.\" Gee thanks. I asked if there was some sort of policy for orders later than 40 minutes, he said \"no we don't do that.\" I told him the email receipt I received quoted 18-28 minutes for delivery his ridiculous response was \"yeah we have to change that. It's impossible.\" I tried to explain to him that this was giving false information and he kept repeating that \"we have to change that.\" I tried to tell him that well that was all well and good, the information sent to me was incorrect and in fact 20 minutes off in time difference. He told me that Pizzas took 40-50 minutes to deliver (COMPLETELY untrue based on past experience with this and other pizza places).  He continued to feed me excuses and clearly was just trying to get me off the phone without taking any responsibility.   My lukewarm pizza was delivered at 4:11pm by a driver on his cell phone - clearly being yelled at by the same person I was on the phone with before.   A lovely customer service experience.   P.s. This is also the location that once delivered me a pizza complete with the metal baking tray in the box."}
{"text":"I normally don't have a problem with Dominos--you pretty much know what you're getting for your money.  Unfortunately, this Dominos, even though it is less than 3 miles away, won't deliver to my address. Not only will they not deliver, but they will take my order, ask me what the cross-streets are (so they KNOW how far I am), and wait 30 minutes before calling to tell me that they cancelled my order.  They could have checked my address when I gave it to them, or they could have called and asked if I wanted to pick it up instead, but instead they simly cancelled my order--and didn't let me know until it was supposed to be at my door,"}
{"text":"This place is legit, it's almost like they are in fast forward. Everytime I order here they crank it out and FAST but they don't skip on the quality so I'm good with that. If you are looking to eat pizza for inexpensive and quick this is your location folks, ordered here plenty and haven't been dissapointed once. And I was quite pleased with the customer service, I had ordered a soda and they had forgot it, upon telling William, my driver, he immediately returned to the store and brought me not one but 2 sodas within a few minutes. thanks again buddy!"}
{"text":"We have purchased pizzas from this location before but this time....   The whole pie was covered in what must have been garlic butter or they used a pan that had garlic bread on it.  I don't like (but do tolerate) garlic and my wife is allergic to it.  We had two pieces and threw it into the garbage.  We won't be back."}
{"text":"I ordered carry out. Pizza was good. Pizza was ready on time. Cashier was friendly, helpful and quick."}
{"text":"Awful place to order from they messed up everything and they repeated it to me. How does that happen? Everything was cold it took so long to get to me. But they get one star because they happen to be the only place delivering this late."}
{"text":"I will say, I LOVE PIZZA. I order pizza 6 times or more at week. ALWAYS, ALWAYS DELIVER GIRL FORGOT SOMETHING, MY WINGS, MY SODA, ALL the time!!! Change my order, forgot my coke, I'm tired of this. I will never order again from here. I'm done. You lose a REALLY a good costumer!"}
{"text":"I've always enjoyed Domino's Pizza.  Yummy crust, nice and greasy; perfect late-night go-to.  But tonight's delivery literally made me lose my appetite.  We ordered two pepperoni and black olive pizzas; one with hot sauce and one without.  Both arrived so undercooked you could see the cheese hadn't even melted!  I mean, thanks for being prompt, but would you put my pizzas in the oven before sending them over next time?"}
{"text":"Didn't expect anyone in the delivery business to do what this guy did. STEALING YOUR MONEY! Yes I did tip the guy, but then he just didn't even give a second thought & stole my money with the tip I gave him after. Note to self, never expect the delivery service to be as fair as you would think. Always expect the worse."}
{"text":"It took 1 hour and 10 minutes for a 1 topping pizza and 2 subs.  Got major attitude when I called to check on my order.  Pizza was cold, and one of the subs wasn't right.  Allergic to green peppers but paid $8 for a sub I couldn't eat.   Just call your neighborhood joint"}
{"text":"Was a little skeptical about ordering from this Domino's, as some of the most recent posts weren't too impressive. However, my experience made me question those posts because I have NOTHING bad to say. From placing my order to my conversation with the delivery man, I was blown away!! The person that took my order was patient, had the customer service of an experienced manager. He told me it would be 30-35  mins, in exactly 20 minutes the delivery man arrived. #Sweet. My pizzas were extremely hot and fresh. All in all I am very satisfied. This location has become my favorite and has changed my mind about Domino's. keep up the great work"}
{"text":"Quick but unfriendly... Fonction serves your belly. Thats all !"}
{"text":"Brutally inconsistent Dominos. Everytime we order oven baked sandwiches, they always forget the key ingredients! Not only that, the wings are withered as heck, barely any meat on them. Not even worth the ridiculous price (you're roughly paying $1 per piece of \"bone and fat\").   The \"chicken kickers\" are tasty,and we used to order a lot, big whopping 40-piece orders at a time...until we noticed they started counting tiny \"morsels\" as a \"whole piece\". Literally, large crumbs that broke off a larger piece they counted as part of the 40.  Total fracking rip-off. Totally shady too.  Pizzas are usually the most consistent...until lately, when they heavily skimp on the ingredients. The last we ordered, had almost no sauce, cheese, or anything. I could count the pepperonis on my fingers. The dough was heavy and under-cooked. They also couldn't even get a cheese pizza right.  No more.  Long time patrons of this place but it's gone to heck. We've given them tons of business over the years.   No more.  It's not even worth it. They have plenty of competitors, and they think stiffing customers on their orders, skimping, cutting corners, and basically ripping-off people is going to help their business remain afloat??? This place is a waste of time and money.  Sad!"}
{"text":"Delivery service is what you'd expect for the busy area that they serve - always about 45 minutes - hour from order to delivery.  Only weird criticism I have about this place is that every time I order from them, they drive up to my house and call from their car first to tell me they are here.  Why not just come and ring my doorbell/knock?  I'm not sure why they do this, it seems like an unnecessary step.  Otherwise, the food is always good and hot."}
{"text":"Domino's has delicious pizza, every time! It's always fast, then again we go in to the store to pick it up. I don't understand the negative feedback...honestly what all can you expect from a restaurant chain? I love it, they've got my vote!"}
{"text":"This place sucks I waited so long for my pizza and they told me an hour and 15 minutes and I got to the store and they told me another 25 minutes I'm very disappointed, also all the workers look clue-less"}
{"text":"I have ordered carry out at this location a few times. Foods ready quickly, and always the correct order. The building is clean and the staff is friendly. I drive past two other dominoes to get to this location. The only issue I have had was one time the cheesy bread wasn't fully cooked- nothing a pop in my oven couldn't fix! Give them a try!"}
{"text":"The service from this store has been mediocre as a general rule, but today topped it. I went into the store to buy food and have it delivered to some people I don't know but was told are hungry. They wouldn't do it...said company policy would only allow them to deliver the food if I would be there to receive it. Utter bull! They would not allow me to gift food to hungry people....."}
{"text":"The staff were friendly, helpful and gave excellent service. I ordered food delivered to someone else which they were happy to do and when they had trouble with the address for delivery, they went out of their way to re-deliver. Excellent service and attitude on everyone's part!"}
{"text":"Did the 2 items for  $5.99 coupon, asked to add $2 to make one item a pan pizza 2 topping.  I chose pepperoni which is not a premium topping  Ordered delivery.  I see a 5.99 and 7.99 item, paid by credit.  Checked out and now the pizza increased to $8.99.    Called the store why my price went up.  They were rude and said I don't know how online works but we don't do it that way...and also our store doesn't deliver to you.  Why didn't someone tell me 20 mins earlier when I placed order?  I don't blame the store if every aspect of online ordering is messed up.  They said we will deliver this time.  I rather have the correct store deliver and get the correct coupon than all this hassle.    So apparently when you choose a store for carryout based on the online locator it's not accurate, and whatever coupon you use online isn't accurate also."}
{"text":"Here's the problem, they have awesome pizza.. even for a Domino's! Always fresh to order, zero complaints. Problem is I've been pushed to not only do a yelp review but create a yelp account... you're welcome. So, 1 1/2-ish months ago a girl that works there was delivering a pizza to my complex, she was parked in my assigned parking.. I walked up to the car when I came home from work because I thought someone was in it, I was going to ask them to please move.. I was met from behind with a, and I quote \"don't touch my f***ing car\". I swung around and said, I didn't! I then noticed that she was working, in uniform, and asked if she was kidding me with her attitude.. she proceeded to get in her car back up to scare me and swerve to act like she was going to hit my car, and flip me off with both hands and yell \"f*** you\"!!!!!! I immediately called Domino's, completely flabbergasted, they gave me a \"corporate number\" (in quote because no one called me back, I'm sure it was fake)... flash forward.. the same girl just delivered to my neighbor, HOW IS SHE NOT FIRED?!?! IT'S MIND BLOWING!!!! Get better staff, the area doesn't hinder people needing a job and willing to work hard. I hope she never comes in contact with an elderly person or spit in someone's food, or worse hit someone with her car in her child like temper tantrum. PS. Domino's if you want to contact me or think this is a bogus review please go back through your voice mails and call me back on the number I left.. yah, the one you never called back in the first place."}
{"text":"Ever since Angel took over as the GM the service, food, and delivery have all been excellent. Way more consistent than the Domino's in my home town. Domino's also has the only pan pizza I can actually enjoy!"}
{"text":"Had a horrible experience. Went in to get a medium pizza and lava cakes, they took over thirty minutes to get it ready...Although they told us they were short staffed that night, people were coming in after me and leaving before me. They must have lost my ticket or something. And when they finally gave me my food after 40 minutes I asked the girl if I could have some sort of discount for the major inconvenience.. And she actually went on to argue with me when I said it was unprofessional. I've worked in the restaurant business for years and honestly their lack of customer service was astonishing."}
{"text":"It's a shame what passes as Pizza today, but even more frightening are the people that think it's good. Cha-Ching!!!  But not for the consumer."}
{"text":"I ordered pizza and chicken from this location last Sunday and it took over an hour to get the food. I called to ask what was taking so long and they said they only had one driver so there was a long delay. The food sucked and cost to much. The only reason I ordered Dominos was because of the catchy commercial they were running about text or tweeting for pizza . I got sucked in by advertising. Ugh. I don't plan on ordering from here again."}
{"text":"First they don't want to answer then theyre rude and tell me it will be ready in 10 mins go there and its not ready. Smh."}
{"text":"Second time in a row these people botched my order. I ordered mushrooms, I got onions, which I am allergic to :( And all I got offered was dessert. Should've been a full refund of my $$. NOT nice. They did send me a second order, which was correct, and both delivery guys were quick and very nice. But still, twice in a row? Really?"}
{"text":"I ordered a pizza for carry out here and asked the manager to hold it for me because I had to get cash to pay for the order since their card machine wasn't working correctly. When I got back from home with the cash he had cancelled the order and thrown away my pizza. He offered no apology. He just said \"Yeah I threw it away.\" Worst experience at a dominos I have ever had. If you want pizza AVOID THIS LOCATION. It's right by my house and I will go out of my way 15 minutes just to go to a different dominos."}
{"text":"I really have not been a fan of Dominos but I really like the recent changes they  have made. The crust is way better than before, the sauce is more robust and the cheese is fantastic. I personally enjoy the Handmade Pan pizza with BBQ sauce, chicken, pineapple and mushrooms. The price is comparable to lower end quality pizza joints and Dominos blows all them out of the water. Its hot, fresh, and delivered on time."}
{"text":"Worst dominos, and I order a lot of dominos. They never get the order right. Burnt gross pizza"}
{"text":"First time ordering Domino's and it happened to be here. I think they're renovating the space, so I see their process of making pizzas.  This location's staff is pretty strange for being busy, so I'll list what I saw during my wait for a large pepperoni/sausage pizza.  1. The cashier guy was alright since he got a few calls during my ordering in front of him, so I had to wait for a bit and after paying I had to wait a longer while to get my receipt since someone on the phone ordered something big.   2. The old man customer was getting a bit impatient by walking to different parts of the waiting area since there's no chairs to wait on.  3. While waiting for my receipt, I saw who appears to be the manager with very long blonde hair. It's tied high, sure, but the length of the hair was way too long above her butt still to just be free after the hair tie. The hair needed to be bunned or in a net because everytime she stepped, her hair swayed side to side proudly above the counter where they put the marinara on the dough.  4. After the cashier guy was done on the phone, there seemed to be some sort of panic about an order, so I saw a young tall, blonde woman/girl somewhat in the trash looking at a receipt and tucked it back in the garbage. Then I saw her kind of wipe or brush her hands on the apron and went to the cashier machine to look for order numbers since everyone's still calmly panicking.  5. The blonde girl went back to the pizza dough counter without washing her hands, so she brushed her hands again onto the apron. She moved three small/medium rised dough that seep over the plates (so she's touching the dough) onto the counter and started putting marinara onto them. Then she brushed her hands onto the apron again and went into the back to get a cheese box to refill the cheese.  6. The blonde girl keeps walking around slow and calmly, taking up time while the woman fixing and cutting all the finished pizzas and other food into boxes was in a panic. Seriously, she's either new or too tired, so she's taking up time looking for a knife to cut the cheese box or looking for whatever the other woman was needing. The cashier guy asked me to sign the receipt after the wait, and said he'll check up on my order because I don't want to see open marinara after he said there'll be enough cheese so I don't have to order extra while I was ordering (but since the phone call took too long, the tall blonde girl did my pizza before looking in the trash earlier in #5). I never saw the cashier guy since this point.  7. The old man customer saw me leaning over the barrier-wall with my cheeks in my palms watching them. He came over and did the same cheeks in palms, and complained how it's taking such a long time since he was waiting--who knows when--before I entered the store.   8. The delivery man came back in the store hurriedly because he saw me get out of the car when he just left. A new man came, and the delivery man pointed and the new man said he's picking up and then the delivery man asked the old man customer his name so that he can look for his order. He got it right away and checked the order, then the man asked my name for my order and got it right away, checked it and I left.  9. When I checked it, it was a bit burnt looking but I wanted to leave soon after getting it. So when I'm home and eating it, I don't know how I feel about eating it. Burnt a bit, and open marinara is showing--I should have ordered extra cheese! So order extra cheese. It also tasted like I bought frozen pizza and put it in my oven even though I saw it made--which is pretty weird.  In total, 9 things happened that seemed off for a food business. Then when I'm on the main domino's site looking where I could put a review or a complaint, there's a video that has a black-hair lady whose hair was not tied or in a net either and I'm like, \"ah, that explains it.\" https://pizza.dominos.com/nevada/las-vegas/89118/5355-s-decatur-blvd/  I am pretty grossed out. But hooray to the delivery man for actually delivering when the people who worked in the store was unorganized and being gross."}
{"text":"Though I have lived in Anthem for about 15 years, I never got pizza here. And what a great place-what have I been missing? We used the on-line website (mobile optimized nicely) and ordered as we were driving back from Flagstaff after a long exhausting day. I walked in and somehow he knew what pizza was mine...huh? How? Pizza mysticism? The staff was MOVING and pumping out those pizzas, I was in and out in under three min. Dang. And yes the pizza was good. It is the staff and service that gets the rave reviews today. Thanks Domino Folks!"}
{"text":"Horrible service, the cashier didn't have a name tag on or it was hidden under the apron, didn't let me pick up a Pizza for my co-worker unless I had the ID and credit card and when I went back with her ID and credit card he said he can't do it even though it was paid cause it wasn't my name on the card which he resented to tell me the first time and when I went back with her he started arguing with her, which their was no need but he was persistent to argue when all he had to do was hand her the pizza and say nothing and go back to work"}

{"text":"I've eaten at Dominos once.. And I don't think I'll ever be back. My coworkers and I had order lunch with some garlic bites.. Those were cold and the extra sauce we ordered and paid for? No where to be found. When we started eating the pizza, that was cold as well.. It tasted like it was sitting out forever! So when I called and told them about everything being cold and the missing sauces, I was promised a replacement  pizza my next visit. But when I called to redeem it, they didn't have my name on file! Not to mention how rude the employee was! If you want cold pizza, and bad service, dominos is the place for you!"}
{"text":"I made a carry-out order from an online special, so no complaints here about the delivery time. It's the first time I've had Domino's Pizza in a while, and it turned out to be your pretty standard pizza fare; not great or terrible, just average. The staff seemed friendly enough. Something that bothered me is that they were charging $6 for the tiny Lava Crunch cakes when some other locations in the area were only charging $4 for the same thing. In my experience ordering from Pizza Hut they had a reasonably-sized tray of brownies on sale for $5 no matter which location you ordered them from. Charging $6 for two tiny Lava Crunch cakes is ridiculous."}
{"text":"The service here is always fast, and every time I've gone here, the people were so friendly! (especially the cutie who made my pizza, Calvin) Their location even has a cool chalkboard wall that you can draw on if you're waiting in the store for your pizza! The pizza is always great, and the parmesan bread bites are to die for! (:"}
{"text":"I ordered a pizza online and it came with a topping missing, looks like theres not even enough of the others and cold. I called to talk to a manager and he told me all he can do is give me a free topping for next time or come get my pizza and bring me a new one 30 min later after I waited an hr. I'm so upset. Never ever again. The lack of concern and rudeness is not needed"}
{"text":"Good pizza,Sure it's Dominos. But the manager I spoke with when part of my order was forgotten was out of control. Basically if they forget to deliver something you paid for prepare to be blamed for it by the manager. First it was the drivers fault, then my fault for not staying on the phone long enough. I called back a third time and they said I would be getting a credit for my next order. I said I at least needed the dipping sauces for my breadsticks that were now hard as rocks and not edible. The manager yelled at me for hanging up the phone the second time I called. I didn't realize I was to stay on the line until the driver arrived. I assumed that since they had my number and address it was ok to proceed with my dinner. I've never been spoken to by such a blame shifting 'man' while giving them business. Fast delivery,  managers a bit of a loose cannon though."}
{"text":"If it was possible I would put a negative one star. I ordered pizza from here and no other dominoes has let me down so I was faithful with this one. The delivery driver was nice not a problem. The pizza was BARELY CUT. My 5 year old nephew can cut a pizza better also the cheese was almost futile. Thanks dominoes I'll take my business elsewhere!!!"}
{"text":"I absolutely appreciate Domino's pizza, it has helped me through the toughest winter days where I don't feel like doing anything but eat some awfully fatty pizza. They're always fast at delivering and their pizzas aren't that bad. Good for a temporary fix.  I've definitely tasted something better though, coming from an Italian dominated town, I've had authentic Italian pizzas before. But you wouldn't go to Domino's for that, you go for instant fatty satisfaction. And chances are, you'll get it."}
{"text":"Beautiful delivery person came by nice touch to laziness did not want to go out! To damn cold in Arizona lol 20 years coldest for some reason. Anyways back to the review the pizza okay! What do you expect for $10-30 pizza people! One pizza made good, one with bubbles, wings, coke came with it look good overall A+ good professional service especially the south side you won't believe even the poor part of town turning around since the bad ruin everything around not business and drugs screw up people lives here in Arizona glad to realize people are wanting good instead of destroying their lives! Dominos keep up the good workers you have there I will order there keep you in business just of the service and people you hire that respected by me I don't care as much the food and be okay. It's the people and service you pay these people it's a hard job not easy in the service industry! You educated people judge me all you want grammar or whatever I don't care I have two degrees I speak my mind so lay off losers like you order anything to cheap to order owe so much in student loans think you better than everyone else! You are NOT!"}
{"text":"If this Dominos experience could be rated a 0 it would be!! Let me start out with saying I have been getting food from this location since my dad was store manager when I was growing up. Tonight just like any other pizza night I placed a pick up order online (08/15/16) a medium pepperoni and banana pepper pizza with a stuffed cheese bread. Of course I followed the tracker and waited until after my order was complete to leave my house. Upon arrival I was told \"my pizza was never made\" after I had already paid for entire meal. Turns out delivery driver took my pizza on a joyride. The employees tried offering me a cold pizza and cheese bread that had been taken in a car for who knows how long. I am extremely disappointed with the carry out service and will never be using this Dominos location again, this location as gone to complete crap!"}
{"text":"Dominos Pizza is definitely not my favorite pizza, but it IS generally my first choice because of their 2or more for $5.99 deal, it allows for much customization and is a great value in the way of delivery pizza (or pasta or chicken or subs or any combination). Plus the one near me usually always gets the order right and is never late."}
{"text":"Yeah, I'm giving a Domino's Pizza five stars. Whatcha gonna do about it?  Here's why. I know Domino's isn't a high class joint, but you have to rate it against what it is. Among inexpensive pizza delivery places, I think this particular Domino's is pretty damn good.  1. You can order online, and then a tracker gives you by-the-minute updates on your pizza's status.  2. They ALWAYS have coupons, and they're easy to use online.  3. They deliver fast. I've had pizza in my mouth within 20 minutes of clicking \"order.\"  4. I like the new recipe pizza. It's not gourmet, but if I wanted gourmet, I wouldn't be ordering Domino's. I ordered Domino's because I wanted something greasy and hot that pairs well with my beer.  5. They are cheap! I get convenience, speed, and tastiness for a minimum price!"}
{"text":"We have ordered delivery from this location many times and the service is reliable. If we order ahead, it always arrives when they say it will. Wings are also quite good. The other day we ordered online and the driver showed up only 20 minutes later -- food was HOT! Our only suggestion is that they don't offer a dairy-free cheese option."}
{"text":"This store sucks.  We ordered a two pizzas, and I was watching their tracker system for it.   It sat in the \"Quality Check\" area FOR 20 MINUETS! I KNEW when it arrived it would be cold.  An HOUR after I placed the order it got to my door, ice cold.  I gave it back to the driver, she didn't know what to make of the situation and left.  She also forgot my soda. Wasted an hour of our night.  This is the worst store ever.  MAYBE every 1 in 7 times, it's good, but I get so frustrated that they can't be consistent.  I guess they are consistently bad.  Save your time and money, DO NOT order from this location.  I'm sick that it isn't run better, they need to have a DM come in or something and train them how to make a pizza and drive it in a car to a house while it's still hot.  ETA:  Might as well rant about the other failures I've had with this store.  Driver forgot our soda, had to go to 7-11 to get one for us. Another time we got a 2 liter, it was room temp....gross. Wrong pizza in the box with the right info on it. Underdone crusts. Hardly any cheese when it was supposed to be \"extra cheese\" Whole topping sliding off the pizza. Crackhead delivery driver around lunch time. Horrible customer service with any of these issues."}
{"text":"So I called Domino's rival to order myself a pizza. I was told they couldn't make it the way I wanted. Hmmm, seeing how I am the one paying for an eating the pizza shouldn't I have it how I want? One would think so... Guess not with common pizza places.  Just like in life, you don't always get what you want when others think they know what you need.   So I call Domino's an I ask if they can make me a pizza the way I want it. Yep, they sure could and they sure did!  The wait time from placing the order to picking it up was 15 minutes. I arrived early so I sat in the car and waited. When I went in to pick up my pizza it had just came out of the oven. I was fearing as I had read reviews about this particular location that were less than pleasant.   Smiles. The staff were very friendly and professional. The price was actually less than the rival I had contacted earlier. The store was clean.   Pizza is pizza from the common pizza joints. It is what it is. All in all a wonderful experience. I'd come back."}
{"text":"Pizza was hot and fresh and the service was amazing. Thanks Chad! If I could give it a six star I would."}
{"text":"Always early and always perfect. I love their ordering online its so convenient! Never a bad experience and their food to me is absolutely satisfying. My favorite pizza hands down."}
{"text":"For about 3 years, I've had nothing but good service from these folks. I receive all orders quickly and if there's ever any trouble finding my house (because Google Maps couldn't get it together for almost forever), they would call my phone and I could give them directions. No drama, no hassle, normal pizza place stuff...  Just don't order from them 5 minutes til close. Ok, I GET IT. Trust me, I've been on that side of the phone before. No one likes a last minute order when they're cleaning up and shutting down. Doesn't mean you ought to rush or half-cook the food... If you're open, you're open, plus there's food standards... Idk, I know I won't be a popular review for saying this, but I get off work really late and didn't wanna run back out so I ordered delivery--it's not an uncommon story.   Anyways, it won't stop me from ordering from this store (the others won't deliver to me anyways), and I'm DEFINITELY not switching to Pizza Hut or Papa John's... but I won't be turning to them for late night service any longer.   I don't like raw pizza dough."}
{"text":"Placed order online.. Food was made quick and delivered fast! Felt like one minute I just ordered and the next my door bell was ringing! Pizza was made just how I ordered and food was hot.. Delivery driver was very friendly!"}
{"text":"I ordered here and the pizza tracker said my order arrived in 20 minutes. 15 minutes later I call the store because it still wasn't here. They said delivery left 15 minutes early and it should be here any second. An hour after ordering it still wasn't here. I called the manager who wasn't willing to offer any help or assistance or even give an update on what was going on with the delivery then hung up on me. I will not ever use this Dominos again. Pizza finally arrived and they already had my credit card. I guess I'm the sucker."}
{"text":"The Pizza is Okay, but the most important part for \"Dad on a budget\" is that I can feed a family of four for $20.  The prices are very good.  Staff are friendly enough and I always pick up so I can't comment on the delivery.  They say their \"Feast\" pizzas come with extra cheese; my opinion is that it is still insufficient cheese for a pizza. I recommend the medium Deep Dish Pizza - if you put extra cheese on that, it is great!"}
{"text":"There pizza is always greasy. It was really sloppy and just fell apart as we ate it last night. But for 6 bucks it's  pretty good."}
{"text":"I always order the thin crunch crust with bacon and pinapple, its always soooo good, except one time it was burnt but its alright because it was only the 1 time. I only order delivery and have never met the staff but whoever Justin (says on the tracker) is, he makes it the best, always f**king delicious! Love this dominos!!!"}
{"text":"lets see. i order a pizza online. after 45 min, the preparation meter was still showing being prepped. i called the store to check on my order and they gave my pizza to someone else with the same name. i quess the quality check process and the meter were not working that night. very sad. it was a good reminder as to why i don't order from Domino's anymore. live and learn i guess and i got a stiff reminder why i have stayed away. the pizza may be advertised as better but the service is still the same old poor. . i wont order from them again."}
{"text":"I called this dominos around midnight on Saturday night. Their hours listed says they're supposed to be open till 1am. After listening to a preset ring back tone for 10 minutes I hung up. I decided to drive there to order in person thinking maybe they're busy. When I arrived two workers were there and ignored me standing at the locked door for a minute then finally after knocking on the glass, one who appeared to be a manager shook his hand to mentioned he will not open the door as in they're closed. I pointed at the hours posted blatantly posted on their door and he still gestured me away. They're clearly open and operating for delivery as during the time I went back to my car and wrote this review a delivery worker pulled in and grabbed more food and left again. Maybe they only want to remain delivery for the night for more tips? I'm not sure what the deal is but maybe you should list the hours correctly or post that hours are subject to change. Terrible customer service"}
{"text":"So I called again tonight to order I spoke with a lady. I had a coupon which I previously used her before.  4 come in the coupon book. So I guess it was a problem this time, I was put on hold twice and wad told the manager busy. Ask me read the coupon repeatedly.  I was then put on hold again,  so I called the new pizza Hut in vons shopping center."}
{"text":"I've ordered from this store numerous times and have had nothing but problems. The first time we ordered they forgot toppings, on Halloween it took them over 2 hours to get out pizza to us (we live 7 miles from this store) the phone at the store was busy for the entire night and we called over 40 times. When the pizza did get to us it was cold and the delivery boy was rude and disrespectful when we commented about it. I ended up contacting corporate over the situation when I couldn't reach the store to complain and they said they would credit me $25 to give them a second chance (in reality it is their third chance) and when I called today to order a pizza using the credit, I find out that no such credit was ever credited to my account. It has been a miserable experience with this store in general since I moved to this side of town."}
{"text":"If you order from here get it take out. It took them 2 hours to deliver my one pizza. My poor kids were starving and I didn't even get an apology. I kept calling and they kept saying it would come in 5 mins. They need to get their act together."}
{"text":"Just ordered and received the most delicious pizza (hand tossed and thin crust) on a beautiful rainy day!  Delivery was relatively fast considering it is one of our rare rain storms and the driver was pleasant and smiling.  I have used this store for years and only a couple times have I been disappointed unlike when ordering from Papa Johns and receiving gooey, under cooked pizza.  Sure it is not an old world, feels like Italy but it is delicious and it is Arizona haha."}
{"text":"Good fast pizza. We Like the all meat. Generous helpings. Ordered during the week, so don't know what Friday night is like. Will order again. Tasty."}
{"text":"Its a Wednesday night. You wouldnt think that would be a high volume night. Even still, my order took just about 2 hours. Placed an order for A SINGLE PIZZA. Just one. When it finally arrived it was barely even room temperature. Should have saved money and time and made one, but thats why we order out...because we are lazy. Wont be using these clowns again. They have never been fast in the past, but this is just absurd."}
{"text":"If you order anything extra or double, there is an 95% chance that they will not put extra. They charge you for the double toppings and give you minimal. I requested double bacon on my last 10 orders, of those 10, 1 had extra. The other 9 had normal or light. I called them and let them know about it each time.  The first time we ordered for delivery, it took them an hour and we are literally 0.2 miles from the store. When your order is correct and delivered in a timely manner this place is great! Don't expect it to be great"}
{"text":"Ordered once. About 3 slices were just bread. Really thin on toppings. Figured it was just that one time. Tried again a few weeks later, same thing. The second time I even said \"extra\" cheese to make sure it didn't happen again. I looked at it before even swiping my card. Thankfully I did, they didn't wanna make me another pizza so I left it there and won't be going back."}
{"text":"Delivery orders are often missing items or wrong (2 cans instead of two bottles).  Avoid paying by credit if ordering online.  Payment must be done on the website and if they get your order wrong your two choices are waiting over 1hr for your missing items or get a credit for the next order.   Update:  I recently had yet another experience where my order was wrong.  I called to complain and spoke to the manager.  When I insisted they often get my order wrong and it's getting frustrating, he tried to pass it off as 'everybody makes mistakes'.  Of course, that's a convenient excuse when you're taking someone's money and not delivering everything you're supposed to... I told him the situation has gotten way past ridiculous.  He became really snippy with me and suggested he would send a message to everyone in the store telling them 'not to screw up my order'.  I saw the writing on the wall, I'm not ordering from this place anymore.  Downgraded from 2 stars to 1 star.  Stay away from this place, they screw up orders, they have poor customer service and their manager is rude."}
{"text":"This place use to be good. Now don't go there. Last time I was there they hosed the order 3 times. Few weeks later we called for takeout and was told the didn't have the ingredients to make the pizza we wanted to order."}
{"text":"Dominos pizza is ordered for delivery a few times a month to my residence, which is normally hot, fresh, and delivered in a timely manner. Tonight I ordered pizza for delivery and have to say that it was exceptional.  The pizza was fantastic from the crust to the toppings. I hope that they arrive the same for my future orders, as I would not consider ordering anywhere else."}
{"text":"This Dominos at N Hayden is excellent! The food is prepared fast and the pizza and chicken wings are delicious. The staff is also very friendly. Highly recommend! :)"}
{"text":"I've given this location too many second chances. The drivers never remember the extra sauces that I pay for. How much money does Dominoes make each year off undelivered extras?  To add insult to injury. The drivers always argue with me the customer. Telling me why I shouldn't order on a mobile app because they don't see the note for the extra sauce. HEY DOMINOES. How about fixing your app to not allow adding sauce unproperly. Or just hire drivers who can read. Not sure if corporate even reads these reviews, but you've lost me as a customer until you figure out how to deliver what I paid for."}
{"text":"BAD!BAD!BAD!!!! I have given this place several chances but tonight has done me in. They said 25 min delivery. 1 Hour 15 minutes later the poor delivery guy calls me to ask what room number I'm in because they didn't write  it down...this is after I just called 30 minutes before this to ask where my pizza is and she told me it was already on it's way. hmmmm if my pizza was actually on its way like she said then it would not taken another 45 to 50 minutes to get when Domino's is only six minutes away from my house so basically she lied to me If they didn't have my room number they should've asked then. The poor delivery driver calls me to apologize  telling me he just transferred to the store  and he Already wants to transfer out. He felt so bad he wanted to personally pay for my pizza. I told him NO WAY ARE YOU PAYING FOR THIS. he called his manager to ask if he could give me a discount and she said NO! are you kidding me?! Even this 18-year-old delivery driver kid knew that I should've deserved either a discount or my order free. I gave him $10 tip because he said this has been happening all night and he has been getting only $1 tips. It's not his fault that his manager does not know how to run this business. This manager (Teri) is unprofessional incompetent and rude. I would also like to say I have never written a yelp review until now because I felt it was the only way I could let maybe a district manager or hopefully someone that cares about their business here to know what was going on in this particular store. I will never EVER order from this store again they don't deserve my buissness."}
{"text":"Horrible!!! Worst experience with a pizza place ever. Just from my brief exchange with the extremely rude girl who answered their phone (after about 20 rings), I decided to take our business to their competitor. We'll never order from them again. That owner should consider hiring different employees. They're killing his business!"}
{"text":"Kannapolis- Sadly, an old friend has let me down.   This Domino's location is one that has supplied dinner on Sunday night quite a few times for me. It will likely be quite a while -if ever- before this occurs again after tonight's episode.  Earlier this evening, I was pleased to see their signs posted at the location offering a Medium One Topping pizza for only $3.99. Wow,  only $3.99! Now here's a bargain I'll take advantage of was my immediate thought. On ordering later, I could not find the special on the Domino's Android app. No big deal.   Unable to order online, I proceed directly to their store. I learned that the inability to order online was due to this being a one store special there. No problem,  and the worker there taking orders was very pleasant. I'm totally satisfied with this phase of the customer service.  The cooking time ran slightly long, but I would attribute this to the store being very busy at the moment. I was finally given my Pizza and I left for home. Once again, no problem yet with the visit.  Unfortunately, I was very surprised on arrival to open the box and find my Pizza very very well done (crust edges blackened, cheese scorched, meats dried out and tough). To me, this defines nearly incinerated. Some might find this judgment a little harsh. However, look at the picture posted below and decide for yourself. The picture actually gives an appearance of less done than actually is.   Irregardless, this order was not cooked to my taste, so I called back to the store to speak to someone about it. Good customer service would have had a positive response and a solution. This ideal certainly did not happen tonight.  My call was answered by young man who sounded like was likely much less than 20 years old. I explained the situation of the pizza being overdone very courteously and inquired if anything could be done about this.  I then heard him inquire (with the phone still open, not smart in a customer complaint situation) from someone who sounded to be a manager on duty about what to do.  He was told that even if it was remade, it would come out exactly the same. He then repeated the info to me.   My next question was about this inability to control their processes after a customer complaint. He said that the ovens are automated and nothing could be done different.  Quote  \"That's just what I was told to say when this happens. \"  I'm a long way from being a pizza shop owner or a great pizza chef. However, I do have enough sense to realize that a pizza made on an extremely thin crust (actually an out of a box, factory-made cracker) takes less time to cook than a deep dish pizza.  Their conveyor belt oven provides each pizza put on the belt to be exposed to the oven for a set time and at a set temperature. To expect a pizza which weighs likely half of what the deep dish does to not scorch is....well, stupid. No surprise here, just basic Physics 101 stuff.  As I previously mentioned, this location has done fairly well in the past for me. This mistake, then amplified by the attitude of management about a complaint, will cause me to avoid their business in the future.   The pizza business in Kannapolis is too competitive to treat customers carelessly."}
{"text":"this is the worst Domino ever in life to even exist I'm staying at Circus Circus with my husband for vacation the  delivery guy can't even come up to the hotel room he expect you to meet him at the valet then we meet him there he's not even there and has is going through a wild goose chase my husband goes to get his ice and see the different Domino's employees from the same shop that we order from delivering to the room right next to please anybody do not order from them on vacation or anybody living here in Las Vegas do not order from them the delivery guy told my husband that he had to give him a three dollar tip because he was waiting on him and when I tried to call the store back to the store can hanging up on us bad service bad employees terrible  plus the pizza guy had our pizza in the back of his pickup truck his food handlers license should be revoked and he should be physically pulled away from any fast food restaurants if any health inspectors  are reading this you should go in  over there and have them searched enough said blow the dust off this place I'm done!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I have never had a problem with this location. I always get my pizza hot and the order correct every time.  I have no qualms about calling them for my pizza when I crave it."}
{"text":"I have to update my review for this Domino's pizzeria. They now deliver to Desert Hills, and quickly too...usually under 30 minutes.  We've been ordering their pizza once a week for the past few months and have been very pleased with the consistency of a quality pie and great sides (my favorite is the chicken carbonara).  I highly recommend them for delivered pizza orders."}
{"text":"Definitely the best pizza delivery location in the area. Staff is very friendly and has always help me to get the best deal possible."}

I always order Domino's and they never ask to see my credit card or I'd but now my sister can't order pizza for her nieces.... Domino's needs to step up there customer service...very rude"}

{"text":"Ordered pizza and some cinnastix from this location and it took well over 40 minutes to get it. One pizza and 2 boxes of cinnastix. I could understand if it was packed but I was the only one in the store and no deliveries. A customer that came in about 15 minutes after me got their pizza within 15 minutes but I still had to wait for mine. Not bad food just horrible wait times."}
{"text":"We ordered three pizzas for pick-up after riding bike with friends. The staff was friendly from phone to pick-up.   We ordered the old stand-bys, cheese, pepperoni & ham. They were great, cooked perfectly and the parm crust was awesome!"}
{"text":"The ordering ap was ok. The food was prepared quickly and delivered hot. It was the first (and last) time I will ever order one of their subs. They were small, over cooked and had very little contents. 3 stars for the service. I'd give the food 1/2."}
{"text":"The pepperoni pizza and Parmesan bites were delicious, they were delivered quickly, and made for a great pizza dinner for my family. The best thing was the outstanding service at this Dominos. It blew me away. The delivery driver didn't have all of the items we ordered, and when I called in and spoke to Nahim, he handled the problem perfectly. Much better than I would have imagined. Excellent service. Although we only come to North Las Vegas a half dozen times per year, this Dominos location will definitely get me as a customer again. Great customer service and great pizza!"}
{"text":"Got food poisoning from their wings.  Have had great experiences with other Domino's in Charlotte.  Can't say the same for this one.  In short, it's horrible."}
{"text":"la croute de leur pizza, la pate qu'ils utilisent est juste INMANGEABLE. C'est quoi ça, j'paye 40$ pour de la bouffe de merde. Gros non à cette pizzeria"}
{"text":"Absolutely HORRIBLE Experience. Today placed an order for my company (Corporate Business). I specifically requested No Sauce (due to allergy), not only was the delivery guy over 1 hour late, pizza was smothered with tomato sauce. When I called and spoke with Eli (who claims he was the manager) he told me,  I was wrong  (stated there was no requests for no sauce), continued to say they'd send another.  1 hour of waiting again, I call to have him tell me they called me 7 times (my phone never rang) and because I didn't answer they  cancelled my order. I told him that this had been a bad experience for him to reply \"Then don't ever order from us again\". When I asked him to hang on ONE SECOND so I could grab a pen to take down Corporates #, he hung up on me..which followed by him hanging up on me 2 more times.  Later (2 hours later) I called to attempt again to get Corporates #, speaking with \"Billy\" which I believe was still Eli whom REFUSED to give me the telephone number.  So now I want Corporate to know,  the Chandler area and anyone else Eli, \"Billy\" you 2 (1 in the same) are Absolutely the Rudest people, customer service is not for you and Domino's should be ashamed of having you working and representing the Domino's name."}
{"text":"Dominos never seems to disappoint. Always quality pizza and excellent service. Their deals are always the best too."}
{"text":"I ordered a sandwich with no blue cheese, but they gave it to me.  My wife is HIGHLY allergic to blue cheese, and broke out in hives after touching it to inspect the sandwich.  After calling the store the man on the phone lied and said the sandwich doesn't come with blue cheese, I printed the description on the website and he said that it does come with blue cheese, but they never put it on any of their sandwiches unless a customer asks for it.  Once I arrived at the store to return the item and express my displeasure, one of the employees whom I hadn't spoken to on the phone reinforced the explanation that they never put blue cheese on sandwiches and I must be looking at ranch, which is absolutely not part of the order description and hadn't been requested.  I wasn't offered anything for compensation, any apology, nothing.  They just refunded me for the sandwich.  This is absolutely disgraceful customer service, and quite frankly, I don't much appreciate this \"new\" face to Domino's."}
{"text":"My side order is Sweet mango Habanero dip sause. And gave me hot sauce. Make sure you check your order when delivered so you make decision if this happens again cancel and don't pay. They're fucking stupid. Don't know what they do with my habanero they take it home. Really stupid."}
{"text":"I love their app. It's head and showers above the competitions. As a result I tend to order from Dominos. However this time they're at an hour plus from when e app says it was out of he oven and in final QA and still haven't delivered a pizza that according to the app went through final QA more than an hour ago. When I called they told me the app wasn't accurate. I pointed out it didn't automatically advance the QA. They said well it's not out fault. So apparently it's mine because I ordered a pizza from dominos."}
{"text":"Opts out of most coupons that other restaurants choose to honor. Less toppings when they do follow suit. Don't be cheap."}
{"text":"I would give them a zero if I could. The manager hung up on me when I was trying to report an issue. I asked for her direct manager or whoever she reports to and she hung up on me stated that she was closed and she could not assist me. They called me one time, I return the call within minutes, they never bothered to knock on my door. They never even attempted to come into the complex through the appropriate front entrance and returned the food right away leaving us at home hungry. Worst service ever. Hope they enjoy the pizza and chicken they made and never delivered. What a way to make it right, WRONG! I'm disgusted.."}
{"text":"Glad there is a new addition to the Harrisburg area.  I called to order carry out and the employee was new and it took awhile.  When she told me the amount I told her that it was too much based on my coupon.  Although my order was correct when I got there, it was not the price the I expected.  And I'm happy to say my order was ready on time just as I arrived so I don't have to wait. The employee at the register apologized for my not receiving an explanation of the charges and gave me a discount.  I appreciated her assistance and will order from Domino's again.  Welcome to the neighborhood!"}
{"text":"The pizza is edible, but the problem with this location is the disorganization and the wait time. We ordered 2 pizzas for pick up and were told the order would be ready in 30-35 mins. We get there 40 mins later and end up having to wait an additional 45 mins. Apparently someone quit that day and there was a trainee there being yelled at the whole time we're waiting, and a crowd of people waiting to pick up their orders. Ok maybe it was just a bad day.  We ordered from there again and this time when we went to pick up the order, there were 3 people working, but none aknowledged us for about 4 mins while standing there to pick up the order. Finally someone walks up to us and abruptly says, \"name?\" Which we never gave when placing the order, as they just asked for the phone number. Maybe the place sucks to work for and in return the misery spreads to the customer. We wont be ordering from here anymore. There are lots of other pizza places nearby and this one wouldnt be missed if it closed."}
{"text":"Okay, I have to start by saying I used to be a die hard Pizza Hut girl. However, this particular Dominos really won me over. They're polite, super friendly and FAST. Pretty sure The Flash works there, lol. Seriously though, I've never had a problem ordering (from the app and online) and I LOVE the tracker feature. It lets me know exactly what's going on with my order at all times. I also love the points system to earn free pizza. Today I ordered using the app and forgot to mention I wanted light sauce on my pizza. I called up and they were EXTREMELY nice about it and fixing it wasn't a problem. All the delivery guys (and gals!) are really fast and well put together when they come to the door. All these things converted me into a Dominos fan. My absolute go-to when I want something fast and yummy.  Everyone that works there is a freaking rock star!"}
{"text":"It's a Domino's, what do you expect?    Oh yeah, I didn't expect Mexicans making my Italian food..."}
{"text":"Literally the worst pizza I have eaten in at least 10 years. A greasy heap of cheese and pepperoni. Cheese was unevenly spread and undercooked. Got the feeling that almost no effort went into making the pizza. Had to throw it out because it made me feel nauseous. What a joke."}
{"text":"Ordered an XL extravaganza during their 50% off menu priced pizzas promo. Toppings on the extravaganza are pepperoni, ham, savory Italian sausage, beef, fresh onions, fresh green peppers, fresh mushrooms and black olives with extra cheese. When ordering online I asked for no onions and no olives.   When I got to the store they were just pulling my pizza out of the oven which I could see standing in front of the cash register. The two workers there started conversing about something in front of my pizza and I spent another 5 minutes standing their waiting, while the male was doing something which I didn't think much of at the time - Remember this point in the next paragraph.   I took the pizza home and the first thing I noticed was the lack of actual toppings. I've been to three other domino's in the area and this one is by far the worst for skimping on toppings. Took a few bites of the pizza and noticed onions that I asked to be removed from the standard extravaganza.. then it hit me, the male worker making my pizza cooked my pie WITH onions and both workers realized this after pulling it out of the oven. The male worker was PHYSICALLY REMOVING COOKED ONIONS FROM MY PIZZA while I was standing there waiting for 5 minutes. Workers said absolutely nothing about it and let me go on my merry way.   I proceeded to throw the pizza out and will definitely not be going back. Has to be some kind of health code violation with this one.   TLDR:  - lack of toppings - more crust than actual pizza - worker picked onions off of my cooked pizza when he realized I asked for it to not be added when ordering.   Handling dough and toppings before cooking, I can understand. Removing toppings from a cooked pizza that I'm about to eat in ten minutes is absolutely disgusting."}
{"text":"Horrible service the pizza was good  But some cashier working there it seemed like she doesn't love her job, she should get herself another job, she mumble something when I left and was rolling her eyes I was just like bitch you're lucky I'm tired from being in Vegas if not I would of just told her manager to put her ass on check."}
{"text":"This was my first time in here, and I am impressed! Very clean, friendly employees, chalk wall my son loved, steps for kids to watch them make pizzas- DRIVE-THRU pick-up window... brilliant."}
{"text":"I'll echo others here, best Dominos in Sauga -  best chain pizza place too!  Staff is always super nice -  pizza is made super quick and with good quality. If you ever have an issue with an order, they are quick to make you happy and fix it."}
{"text":"Very good place, got delivery here once and everything was perfect. If you do pickup prepare to be wowed it's the most posh looking domino's I've ever seen"}
{"text":"Great service. I went online to place my pick up order. I arrived at the location and the guy was on the phone but smiled and waived. The guy making pizza immediately said hello and said they would be with me shortly. I told him I was picking up but they didn't have my order. I had a confirmation number on their website but I checked my email and didn't get a confirmation email so I must have not finished my order correctly. I have ordered online before so I'm not sure what I did, but clearly it was my error. He helped take my order and they made the pizzas immediately. He estimated 15 minutes but had the pizza out in just after 10 minutes. They were courteous and the service was fast. Great job!"}
{"text":"I order from this dominos pretty frequently since I live right down the street, and they never fail to mess something up. They forget the sauce that I payed for 9 out of 10 times and tonight forgot the main ingredient on my pizza, and the crust tasted old and the cheese was burnt and hardly specked on. Usually delivery pizza places offer a complimentary sauce with your order of wings or bread,  but nope I get charged every single time. Won't be ordering from this location again!"}
{"text":"I ordered, by phone, a simple pepperoni pizza.  We even picked it up.  It was the worst pizza I have ever had.  We both thought a frozen pizza would have been better.  There was nothing on it.  It had VERY little cheese (I am not one who likes too much of anything by the way), no sauce and just a about 2 pepperoni pieces per slice.  It was all bread.  Will never eat there again.  Not worth the crappy calories at all. BUMBED!"}
{"text":"With all the much better locally owned pizza delivery options available in Sun Prairie, I would avoid this place.  The last delivery orders have taken 3 hours and 2 hours, respectively, to get our ice cold pizza and lava cake. And then good luck finding a staff person or manager that cares enough to talk to you after.  Don't waste your time."}
{"text":"We tried both walking in and ordering delivery from this location, with not much success either way. Walking in, the staff was very rude, and we ended up walking right back out because they mixed up the orders twice in a row. Delivery was just a nightmare. Our apartment complex is a block away, and the driver called twice after getting lost on the way there, then he insisted that we come down to get the pizza, rather than him taking the elevator up. The order was completely wrong when we got it, and we were hung up on when we tried to call and complain. We found a different place to order from."}
{"text":"Has always been very good and I like the chicken habanero sandwich. Usually order delivery when no one feels like going out and the food is always good and hot when it arrives not to mention very prompt. You don't have much choice for delivery in this area and I would much rather go here than Pizza Hut any day. Recently tried the pan pizza with their white sauce, chicken, and tomato and we were all pleasantly suprise at how good it was."}
{"text":"I order the same pizza all the time online. The last two pizzas delivered were wrong. I talked to the manager and he said he would fix it and send it right back out. He did and he put the same toppings on, from the wrong pizza. Today I ordered again and they got it wrong again. How hard it it to order sliced sausage and mushroom on a thin crust. Instead they put tiny sausage and mushroom on a regular pizza. When your kids thinks it rat poop and won't eat it. I don't want your free pizza i just want you to get it right... Hello pizza hut"}
{"text":"I tried to order a pizza and the cashier had no idea what she was doing, management shouldn't train people when there's a line out of the door, they said it would be an hour, an hour goes by and there's a line out the door for people picking up all because they hired an idiot to work the register, fire her and get one of many people who know how to work a computer."}
{"text":"This location is awesome! They honored a credit I received after I made a complaint about a Half cooked pizza which is the only time I've ever had a bad experience with dominos but I ordered from a different location, they always deliver the best pizza and are so friendly I HIGHLY recommend them!"}
{"text":"A guilty pleasure on those nights when you're lazy and when you want some cheap pizza."}
{"text":"It took them 45min to get the pizza delivered. When the pizza was delivered it was cold and soggy. I told the delivery guy how much I wanted to tip and he took a couple extra dollars for himself. I didn't count the change until it was too late \"my mistake\". I tried getting a replacement pizza but they said I had no order on file with them. I won't order from this location again, they are thiefs, slow delivery and their pizza is cold!"}
{"text":"I always trusted dominoes they always have great pizza and they come to the door within 5 to 15 minutes but this one time we ordered from Domino's we had to wait one hour and 20 minutes long to get some pizza from this dominoes that was three minutes from our house and it was only a small cheese pizza, I don't know what is happening with dominoes it was probably because they change their name from Domino's Pizza to just Domino's. Stupid people on the commercial said that would be promised faster delivery time that's some bullshit! We could've walked to dominoes and back and got our pizza faster than the delivery guy. Then again I didn't know they hired people who smoke pot."}
{"text":"Pizza was good and did not cost us an arm and a leg.  Only reason I didn't give it a 5 is because I have set up a pizza profile about 4 times and it never seems to be able to find it.  Also I had problems with the APP"}
{"text":"Greasy cheesy goodness. You know what you're getting into with chain pizza, but every once in awhile it just hits the spot. We usually get the pan pizza with pepperoni and extra cheese. It's crispy, bready, salty, and reminds me of how Pizza Hut's pan pizza used to taste twenty years ago. The pan only comes in a medium, but two slices are usually more than enough for me. It would definitely feed at least two people comfortably, unless you've got a major appetite. $9.73 out the door for a quick dinner is pretty good value, and this location always gets my order correct. No complaints."}
{"text":"This is the only domino's location that I like food is always fresh delivery is always fast with good hot food . Customer service is good not one complaint . This location is ran by great leaders thank you all for always providing us with great meals and customer service!"}
{"text":"AWESOME!!!!!! LOVE LOVE LOVE how easy y'all made this!! Everything is perfect and my delivery guy was super nice!! I love me some DOMINOS!!!!"}
{"text":"Wish I had read the reviews for this location before I placed an online order. It is only a few miles from my house so I placed a simple order of two items and was quoted 25 minutes for delivery time. After 45 minutes of waiting, the \"delivery tracker\" said the food was delivered and to enjoy my meal. The food hadn't been delivered so I called the location and they told me it would be there in five minutes, the driver was on the way and nearby. After waiting 20 more minutes, the food was still not here so I called the location again to cancel the order. Their attempt at justifying their horrible service was for me to just pay half of what the order should have cost me. Meanwhile the food was likely cold at this point and it still was nowhere in sight. Seriously? Will not be giving this location any business in the future. Don't waste your time with this location!"}
{"text":"Wow! Placed my order - a sub and liter of coke - (1:31 p.m.); It is still not here at 3:05 p.m. The \"tracker\" said the order is on its way 30 minutes ago. I am 2 miles from their store!!!! Never again."}
{"text":"Veggies - Go for Pan pizza ( onion and green peppers). I am sure that you will love it @Dominos."}
{"text":"Off the bat, I would give them 0 stars if it were possible.  I had ordered a medium pepperoni and a 2 liter at 1:13 a.m. thru grub hub. Got a confirmation of delivery between 2:45-3:00. Thought that was odd considering it was a Wednesday and couldn't be that busy.       3 a.m. came and went. Called dominoes and they said they had not received my order.  Grubhub did, why didn't they??  Was going to forget the whole thing but, through his very bad english, I had thought he said he'd give me a cheese pizza as well as my order. A freebee, cool.    He had gotten here around 4 A.m. and went to the door. I knew order was messed up right away.   No 2 liter and there was a box on top of the pizza box.  Looked thru it. Not only no 2 liter, but gave me a plain pizza and some Chix nuggets.  He then said $15.36.  Heck no I was not paying for this. We went back n forth for a minute or so until I got fed up, grabbed the food and shut the door on him, without paying.      The pizza was lukewarm and clearly a leftover pizza from the store, due to the color n texture of the cheese. Reheated a minimum of 2x's.  Forced down 3 slices and had to throw away. Same as the nuggets.  Never again and will be letting corporate know the unprofessional ism of this chain store!"}
{"text":"This Domino's - don't bother.  I've had nothing but poor experiences with them over the last 8 months of trying to give them my business and them repeatedly proving that they don't want or deserve it.  Point in example - tonight I decided to try them one last time.  The order confirmation stated that it would arrive in 20-30 minutes.  This was over an hour ago.  When I called for an update, the first person said she'd get me an update and then handed the phone to someone else without telling him a single thing.  The next person - completely rude - unapologetic, and informed me that he sent his driver out with 8 other orders, the rest in the opposite direction, so it will get there when it gets there.  He was just plain nasty!  Now I'm still awaiting pizza, can look forward to it being cold, and am left with one more reminder why this Domino's location should be shut down."}
{"text":"Jack V you must work for their competitor. I order from this location often. There staff is always friendly and nice and the delivery is often within 15 min. Pizzas is always hot and delicious! I recommend this location to anyone."}
{"text":"I placed an order with this location for delivery. I had never ordered delivery from them before but had seen them deliver to my complex. I followed the \"pizza tracker\" with a projected time at checkout as 22-25 minutes. At 6:33 it showed it was being delivered by a person whose name I will not type here. I waited....then a few minutes later it showed on the tracker that it had been delivered. I waited. When I called that location, someone answered and spent more time talking to the person behind them giving the answers. First it was that it would be here in 10 minutes....then they said 20 minutes (seriously....50 minutes to deliver from business). Then they said that the driver had been clocked in, clocked out, etc.etc. on the timer, they got busy, etc.etc. Arrival time....7:13pm and the driver said that they had to remake something in my order and they had three other deliveries. I was ordering multiple items for an occasion with a total of $40.67.   I will say that when it all arrived it was still warm, good. The driver was very, very nice, good. But several of the individual orders had burnt (charcoal burnt) cheese on them and the order to delivery...I think I'll just jet down the road to the OTHER pizza place next time. Goodness.  Update...the Pasta Primavera...had no sauce. (but .25 of a star because at least the pizza bread bowl it was is has a nice taste)"}
{"text":"I've been ordering from this domino's for a while now since I moved from mesa. I love the quality of the food they put out. The delivery service is totally different. They are sloppily dressed, very impolite and this last time the driver didn't even have change."}
{"text":"dam dis domino's pizza be bakin dat fried chicken crust like DAAAAM dat shiat rite dere be crispy as fuuk  and the sauce be drippin like DAAAAM i wish dat sauce was thirteen"}
{"text":"Pizza always good, but the wings are awful.  They bake, so mushy and inedible.  Ordered with 'buffalo sauce' but came covered in bbq sauce, then buffalo sauce on the side. Does that make sense to anyone????"}
{"text":"The fancy online thing said Amanda was preparing my pizzas. When it said my pizzas were coming out of the oven I went to pick them up. I wanted to thank Amanda for making my pizzas and it turns out she didn't even work that day. False advertising"}
{"text":"Order from here all the time. The workers are all so kind and genuine. The food is amazing and I never have to wait long. I love dominos"}
{"text":"Wish I could give zero stars. Ordered from this location and received a mildly warm, tasteless, bland pizza with not enough cheese or sauce. Never again."}
{"text":"Reliably good pizza with online ordering so easy it's hard not to order it.  While the pizza is very good it is a little dry. The online ordering system is very easy and fast, perfect for when your hungover and just want to order the same as last time with the touch of a button."}
{"text":"Well that's weird.  Order, perfect.  Delivery perfect.  Driver very nice. Drink cold, pizza hot, bread cheesy.    I actually thought it'd be wrong in some way because of all the reviews, but everything was great. Maybe there's a new good manager?  I dunno..but give 'em a shot."}
{"text":"The worst pizza I've ever had. I will never go back. The pizza isn't cut properly and since when do you have to have crust toppings.? I ordered a pizza and some Parmesan bites, I feel they think that powder/seasoning is amazing but ITS NOT!! At least not when you get too happy with it and dump a fuck ton on everything.... Point being I give 0 stars to dominos the quality of their product is cheap but they want to charge ridiculous prices.."}
{"text":"This place is the best! And they cook the pizza with the pepperoni  on top - just amazing! Love this location"}
{"text":"Worst Dominos to order from. Unfortunately, it's the only location that delivers to me. So, No more Dominos. I have ordered the same Spinach Artisan pizza from there at least 5 times and each time, total disappointment."}
{"text":"Poor hygiene, found a hair in pizza while chewing and when confronted to the store customer service rep they ignored and put me on hold for 20 minutes! Rude customer service!!! I'll advise you to try another location!"}
{"text":"It took 1 h45min to get my order. Nothing special just a pizza, some wings, and a brownie. They couldn't give me an accurate estimate on delivery EVEN AFTER AN HOUR!!!!! All they could do is say its on its way. Total bullshit. They also forgot the ranch dressing that they charged me for! Food arrived lukewarm at best. Will never order dominos again. I always have issues with their services."}
{"text":"Ordered another great deal from this location while studying for summer school exams last week.  Again another treat!  The staff is always very friendly here, my order is always right, and the pizza is always a good value.  Thank you for the continuing excellent customer service."}
{"text":"Literally it took employees 40 minutes for a simple order. Slow service and the employees seemed not prepared for the job, as the one who was taking my order didn't even know how to work the computer. Not even that, yet the pizza was ALREADY prepared and they didnt even have the decency to give it to me, as I waited for my order to be made (but it was sitting on a shelf) Not coming again and wasting my time."}
{"text":"You know what I love best about Domino's?  You can order your pizza online!  Then you can watch it go through the process of prepping, cooking, packaging, delivering.  I find it fascinating :)"}
{"text":"This Domino's location is the best!  I been ordering from them for a long time and they never disappoint.  Great Job you guys, keep up the good work!  P.S. Your delivery drivers are always friendly."}
{"text":"Trust the other reviews and stay away from this place.  Ordered two sandwiches and a medium two topping pizza.  The pizza was just alright... had frozen that tasted better.  The sandwiches were literally raw and doughy.  We called them and have two sandwiches coming to us but we will never use them.  Nothing like taking a bite of nothing but raw dough."}
{"text":"This is the worst experience ever. They delivered pizza that hit the ground.  Toppings were all wadded up in the corner and on the top.  What a rip off, lack of concern and poor service.  This place sucks!"}
{"text":"Yet again this dominos location has poor QA.  I am tired of bringing pizzas back to the store and having to wait for them to make it correctly."}
{"text":"Not only do they take over an hour and a half  to deliver pizza half a mile down the road but they also have terrible delivery drivers. Today I was nearly t-boned by one of their drivers while they ran 3 stop signs."}
{"text":"I came in the store already regretting it because not only was it filthy but the employees acted as if I wasn't even there. So after I place my order of two cheese bread, lava cakes, a sandwich and a pasta (not all for me) i proceed to pay him with three 20 dollar bills which I clearly count in front of him. After which he gives back a five and a one. The order was $40.94 so after waiting a sec he looks at me and walks away. So I asked for a print out of my order which takes him 10 mins todo so. And come to see that he only put in the cash as 43.81. So after seeing that I told them that they shorted me and I'm guessing it wasn't an accident.  So after finally getting there attention again I told them and they just handed me a ten and walked away. After waiting 48 mins I got my food with a fake smile and vowed never to go there again."}
{"text":"The Deep dish pizza with handmade dough is extremely delicious,, I really enjoyed it!!One of the best pizzas I've ever had!!"}
{"text":"Their chocolate lava cakes are the best. Specially when they are warm. Always work with quick service and polite attitude. My place to go when I'm craving pizza."}
{"text":"Pizza was dripping grease that soaked the entire box. Wouldn't recommend this location to anyone unless you want to get sick"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying that pizza is not one of my favourite foods. In fact it's not even on my top ten. But this Dominos location has made me reconsider. For the simple fact that I would eat more then one slice says it all. Toppings are fresh and plentiful,crust is crispy on the bottom and slightly chewy. They constantly are running special promos. So for the quality and price, I might eat pizza more often."}
{"text":"The customer  service is horrible.  I ordered a pizza that was old, full of grease and no sauce. On average  i had 5 pieces  of pepperoni  on my large pizza and 4 sausages. Called to speak with a manger and was told she was too busy to come to the phone.  I spoke with some little name key-o-la. I was told the manger name was Quiana"}
{"text":"They messed up my online order. We ordered one sausage one pep and got home with two pep."}
{"text":"We were visiting Charlotte NC staying at a local motel the door key is an advertisement for this Domino's, the whole key front and back. It even has a discount code for several delicious items using the motel as the discount code.   We called and we were asked the street address, zip code and phone number; I knew where we were just not these details.   Searched the room stopped a maid, tried front desk was busy, ended up requesting to speak to the Domino's manager. He picked up, I apologized for not knowing the information and frustrating him and his employees. He too said he required that information.   To make a long story short we finally managed to contact the front desk obtained the information and supplied it to Dominos.   The irony only later did we learn we were the only motel with-in that corporation name. (.4 miles from motel)  This scares me, is this our youth? The leaders of tomorrow! Is this a world corporation who does not train it's employees for the simplest bump in the road.   Their food is always great but I lost my appetite."}
{"text":"Always awesome. Easy online ordering process. Delivery is quick. Dominos has really improved the quality of their pizza over the last few years. Great variety of pastas, sandwiches, chicken, desserts, etc to please almost everyone in the family."}
{"text":"I placed an order for my group (13 large pizzas) over the phone and had a great experience - they even threw in some cinna sticks for free....awesome!  The scheduled delivery time was 6:30, and when no one arrived, I called shortly after and was told the driver left and was on the way and would be there shortly.  It's worth saying that it was being delivered to McClintock and Apache, a mile from the store and straight down Apache Blvd.  When 15 more minutes passed, I called again and said the driver had trouble finding the place and would be there soon.  When all was said and done it was over 20 minutes late.  I had also asked for plates and napkins, but they were out of napkins (no big deal) but would bring plates, which didn't end up making it with the order either.  Pizza is what you would expect from Domino's - average at best."}
{"text":"Domino's Pizza is pizza that is below average. Although, the last time I had it, it tasted better than I remembered it. I had the pepperoni pizza. The crust is very cardboardy, although I think that has improved a little. The cheese is average; it tastes okay, but it's not something I'm even craving a little bit. The pepperoni tasted fine, but it's hard to mess that up. Overall, I give Domino's three stars because it seems to be improving, however, there are much better choices out there for pizza take out."}
{"text":"Maybe not my all time fave but damn fine pizza. Damn fine."}
{"text":"fast and tasty...............delivery driver Bryce was a sweet heart!"}
{"text":"What's going on here?! Im waiting to pick up and I see the employees placing toppings on the pizzas with their bare hands and coming to the cashier placing their hands everywhere. Really guys?!?!"}
{"text":"I placed an online order and it was simple. It didn't allow me to pick half hot wings and half BBQ for my order. I placed the order anyway and called the store. The 1st time I called I was put on hold immediately and no one picked up the phone after 4 minutes. I hung up and called back and no one picked up the phone  for another 4 minutes. I was going to forget about it but tried once more. The same person asked me to hold and I told them I was on hold for a while and no one picked up the phone. She apologized and said she was the only person there and there were several people on hold. I asked her my simple question & she said they don't do half and half. It took 30 seconds for her to answer my question. I understand being busy but you shouldn't leave all your clients on hold for more than 4 minutes."}
{"text":"Awesome pizza experience! I have ordered from this location about a half dozen times. Each time the food quality has been consistently good and the delivery time short. Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"I wish I had given this place ZERO ratings. This is the most terrible experience I have had in a place in my entire stay in the US of 12 years. The first time I felt I was being treated less than a human being based on my racial background and ethnicity. All because they don't want to serve someone who isn't of their \"ilk\".   I had placed order from this place several times before this incident happened, and never had an issue. However, I think they have started hiring some felons and criminals which shows in the way they treat their customers. If you wish to be served terrible pizza by people who can be counted among the \"dregs\" of the society along with a good old bit of old school racism, this is the place to get your pizza."}
{"text":"Must have been the 50% off online deal but took over an hour to get my pizza and it was warm by the time it showed up.  Pizza taste was OK but did not have the extra sauce I ordered. Will give them another shot someday."}
{"text":"ordered by phone. the customer service rep was very knowledgeable and helpful. as for the food, well, dominos has always been my favorite. im glad they're now in my area."}
{"text":"Speedy delivery. amazing pizza and tasty little pizza bites."}
{"text":"As a general rule, I don't like writing reviews for chain restaurants. I mean, they're a chain, so it doesn't really matter...you know what you're getting. However, I was floored with the service and quality of food I got from this Domino's. Truthfully, my expectations are always tempered when I order anything from a chain, so it may simply be that this establishment provided \"adequate\" levels of service and food quality when compared to non-chain restaurants, but I was floored.   The driver, who was a nice young gentleman, made it to my house in a ludicrously quick time. I mean, it was absurd how quickly he got here. He was polite and I could tell he cares about his job. +2 stars.  The food was extremely hot. When I say extremely hot, I do mean extremely hot. The pizza was steaming as if it came right out of the oven and I had to let it cool down a bit before I ate it. +1 star.  The quality of the food was really good! I guess I haven't had Domino's in quite some time, but they've really stepped up their game. The pizza was exactly as I ordered it, and the cheese was plentiful and gooey. The crust is very garlic-y, which was a pleasant surprise. The sauce was perfect. I also ordered a side of their new \"Specialty Chicken\", the jalapeno pineapple flavor. That was quite a surprise. It was very, very good! +1 star.  The price pushed it over the top. They had a coupon for $13.99 for a medium two-topping pizza with the chicken. This is a great deal, and I scooped it right up. +1 star.   Total: 5 stars  Overview: While this is still Domino's, and you won't experience the best meal of your life, this Domino's may just provide you with the best fast-delivery pizza you've ever had. Try them out!"}
{"text":"Friendly staff. Must have been having a bad night because at least four orders got messed up. Not sure that the on line ordering is working well, or maybe some more time or experience will help. Had to wait about 20 minutes for a pizza to be cooked because the order did not go through properly. Staff was apologetic. Food was decent and reasonably priced using the on line coupons.      I would go there again, but I would not be surprised if I had to wait. The on line ordering is really being pushed by the corporate, but I did not think the ordering process went very well' it's not user friendly. Perhaps some web magic can fix this problem, but in the mean time I will probably call it in and hope for the best."}
{"text":"Awsome Pizza. Fast and friendly service. Will order again. I enjoyed watching the status online."}
{"text":"Great taste pizza. I often order Hwaiian and Extravaganza for late dinner after work and the pizza taste always great. However depends on who's working there, it seems like I get different deals on cans of pops. I hope that it is more consistant. Other than that, food taste good and fresh."}
{"text":"This place rocks. CONSISTENTLY good pizza and a great staff of delivery drivers. They always make it right if they make a mistake."}
{"text":"Whether it's delivery or carry-out, the pizza and chicken are always consistent and prepared nicely.  The folks that work at this location are always nice.  If you're looking for national chain pizza, you can't go wrong here.  My usual is the Pacific Veggie on the traditional crust."}
{"text":"Pizza was about as good as one would expect from one of the big chains, which is to say marginal at best. Delivery was quick and delivery driver very friendly. He even brought paper plates and napkins as we had requested. The order-taker was a slightly different story...we were having the pizza delivered to our community pool, and I told the person I wasn't sure of the street address - his reply was \"you don't know where you live?\".....completely uncalled for and served no purpose other than to leave a bad taste in my mouth. Dominoes, please remind your staff what acceptable phone etiquette is."}
{"text":"Oh wow I was so pleased with my online order. It arrived in about 20 min . I ordered off the 5.99 menu and got a pizza and cheesy bread mmmmh I highly recommend this dominos!"}
{"text":"The team at this location is always professional, courteous and on top of my orders. I order large quantities for work and have never received the wrong order, a messed up order or had any challenges. They are always accommodating of any special requests and pick up times. This is the place to feed the masses at great prices."}
{"text":"First time pizza was okay. 2nd time, delivered pizza with mushrooms on it, under the cheese. I'm allergic to mushrooms. They also messed up simple coke order. Called talked to manager, she said she would refund order. Two weeks later, still not refunded. Manager also gave me a credit. 3rd pizza came, no sauce, under cooked, cheese nasty tasting, threw it out. Still had to pay for the sodas.  3 times, not nearly as good as other dominos joints. Go to another place or cook a frozen pizza, would be better tasting than what you might get here."}
{"text":"Nothing like the pictures. Very sparse toppings. At least Pizza Hut gets it! Pizza looks like the online order. Bye dominos"}
{"text":"AWESOME!!! I ordered online and was updated through the entire process. From when the pizza was put in the oven to the point when it was delivered. It got here within 20 minutes and was delicious and hot."}
{"text":"Worst service possible. You would think delivering a low chain pizza would be the easiest job in the world, but apparently it takes a rocket scientist. Management didn't help. I don't know if I just ordered on a bad night, so I might give him a second chance with future, but I don't see much hope for improvement if it was this bad."}
{"text":"The ordering online was fast and easy.  My order arrived fast and hot exactly the way I wanted it.  The delivery person was polite and friendly.  This was a rare occasion when my family was gone and I was alone and super hungry. For once I got to order what I wanted with just the toppings I wanted and it was perfect and absolutely delicious.  Thank you dominoes for making my night awesome!"}
{"text":"I read the reviews and said it was just impatient people being over critical then i ordered. Food was ready in 8 minutes. Turns out thats a little to fast. Pizza was not fully cooked i had to microwave each slice to make it edible.  Save yourself the pain and just go to the one in penn hills."}
{"text":"Pizza was hot & tasted great (normal a pizza hut person but I think that's about to change) my order was correct the price was great to the young man that helped me was nice clean cut young man"}
{"text":"It's the worst Dominos location I have come across. I waited more than 2 hours for my pizza, even after repeated calls."}
{"text":"I ordered the Philly cheese steak with extra meat and cheese. OMG, if this is extra meat then I can't imagine how little meat the normal sandwich has.  Almost $10 for a sandwich, it better be amazing. It wasn't. Skip it."}
{"text":"The only reason I gave it 1 star is because it wouldn't allow for 0. This place is awful! Customer service and delivery are sorry as can be. Not to mention the pizza is not all that. I ordered from here twice and it took almost two hours to get the pizza delivered. Calling didn't help because the manager lied the first time and said he would send sodas in order to compensate me, never happened. Second time I was left on hold forever for a manager. Please don't waste your time or money. They should not be in business."}
{"text":"So I normally order here and it takes 15 minutes max for pick-up. I usually walk over and works out perfectly. I was put on hold for over 17 minutes and when I arrived they told me they were understaffed and were waiting for mor employees. They could have told me this instead of being placed on hold indefinitely. Also no manager on duty."}
{"text":"You guys ALWAYS make the perfect pizza and it ALWAYS comes on-time or before expected!  I don't know how you guys do it! You make your competitors look like childs play compared to you. Your competitors are repeatedly slow, late, inconsistent, and they seem as if they don't know if they're coming or going.  Thanks for always being there, and respecting my time (the most important factor).  I will always recommend the store on 75th ave and lower buckeye. You guys rock!  Great management! I can never say enough good things about you!!!  This is going on yelp too!"}
{"text":"pizza is pizza in most cases and it's true here.  i like the prices and they've never gotten my order wrong.  :)  i'll keep going back."}
{"text":"don't waste your time like I did, worst pizza experience. yesterday I ordered a medium pizza with two dipping sauce, they had a %50 percent deal going on so the total came up to $13. the pizza came OVER 2 HOURS later!! also the pizza was cold, it wasn't even cut and they forgot my dipping sauce. the worst part was I called the store several times and every time it went to voicemail. the driver said he would pay for my next pizza if I call the next day and just explain what happened. when I called today the lady on the phone said the best she can do is give me %75 off my price that I paid yesterday so I would pay around $3. when the pizza came this time the driver had a different price then what was told to me. I called the store before paying for this new pizza and someone new picked up and no one could find the price that was told to me earlier. now I'm pissed because I wasted my money twice on this pizza and I always order from this place. any new pizza place ideas?"}
{"text":"These guys suck. I ordered a pizza and they sent one thin crush rather than hand tossed. Mistakes happen, which is TOTALLY UNDERSTANDABLE. I called to get the correct order and they told me that it'd be an hour before I could get my correct order. Not to mention they were over explicit that they wanted the in correct pizza back. Yeah I totally wanted to go out of my way to lie to get an additional pizza. Why can I order a pizza and receive it in about 30 mins yet because it was a mistake on their part, I had to wait at least an hour. Seriously?! Horrible customer service I will never order here again. I advise going with another local pizza company. Dominos has good pizza but this location is horrible."}
{"text":"Food is good.  Delivery time is good.  Delivery person - introvert.  Didn't feel valued when delivered.  Nice that the food tastes good, but customer service is a must for repeat customers.  Please advise!"}
{"text":"The people at this Dominos are friendly, the delivery is timely and reliable, but the wings are reliably the worst wings I have ever had in my entire life.  After they were flabby, fatty, and undercooked the first time, I was dumb enough to order them again several months later, figuring it must have been a fluke.  Nope!  Anyway, stay away from the wings and you will have a fine experience here.  Also, this location sometimes has \"manager's specials\" that you won't find on the website.  Worth asking about."}
{"text":"This particular Dominos is the worst of the worst in so many awful ways. I recently got a pepperoni pizza that was so bad I threw the whole thing out. I'm not sure how to post pics of the pizza, but I will if I can. Use any other franchise in the city, but DO NOT use this one. They are quite simply HORRIBLE."}
{"text":"Worst Domino's outlet in Calgary.. The owner does not know how to talk with a customer; he is arrogant and rude and doesn't have any professionalism at all.  I wonder, how they can ask a customer to leave and never order pizza from them again. Shame on this kind of service."}
{"text":"Would give 4.5, but since that's not an option, will go with 5.  Always polite drivers. Rarely make a mistake.  Timely.  Good price.  Exactly what you're ordering for.  Been ordering from them for years and only had one mistake.  Good work."}
{"text":"Order was quick and delivery guy was very friendly. Everything was correct with my odd choice of toppings, and the garlic parmesan sauce was delicious! Hot and tasty pizza! Can't complain. :)"}
{"text":"I haven't had dominos at this location in about a year, because the previous management was horrible. So recently I went in to try the new pan pizza and it was amazing!!!!!!!!!! and the whole atmosphere of the store was great too!!! Today Marcos lost a valued customer and dominos gained one!!!"}
{"text":"My order had somehow duplicated online, I called them up and they were happy to send out the correct pizza. It was easy and simple and they were very kind about it!"}
{"text":"Poor food. Delivery service was good - fast and friendly - but the food was awful. Everything was dry and salty. Dry pizza with almost no sauce or toppings, less food than a frozen pizza. Chicken wings weren't sauced at all and consequently were very dry and rock-hard. Everything tasted like it was dredged in salt.   Within 30 minutes, everything hardened into food fossils, the way microwaved food does. It's Dominos - I wasn't expecting gourmet - but this was very disappointing. I won't return and I would not recommend this location."}
{"text":"Check your order before the driver leaves. It will be missing something. I have ordered twice from this store it happened both times.   I decided to try this place again. The same issue. No dipping sauce that I ordered.   This place should be zero stars"}
{"text":"First time ordering from this location. But typical Dominos fashion the order was incomplete upon delivery.   This is a corporate wide issue. Very poor training or systems. It is time to give up on Dominos and move on. Orders incomplete about 75% of time."}
{"text":"I ordered 2 medium pizzas that we on special for $5.99 along with an order of the chicken nuggets at the same price. If the owner would have seen the pizzas I received, he would have had a heart attack! All the toppings we piled in the center of the pie. There was about 2 inches of nothing between the toppings and where the crust started, not to mention the crust. It was delivered very fast by a guy who was a religious freak who kept blessing me and my food, all while the door was open and bugs were herding themselves in. He thanked me for the business because business was slow. After seeing my order, I can understand why. I will never order it again. By the way, the driver told me I had saved over $16 because of the special. I can't imagine how mad I would be if I had paid over $41 for what I got!!"}
{"text":"Domino's has stepped it up great pizza.  Delivered on time and hot!"}
{"text":"Ordered 2 medium pizzas using the Dominos app at 6:20 tonight. It is now 7:40 and I just got a call that the delivery driver will be here in a few minutes. This is the second order I have had with this restaurant that has taken over an hour. Never again."}
{"text":"I used the above phone number to call in an order and eventually found out that the number actually belonged to the Dominos on 4th st. The staff at this location seemed unconcerned, so here you are: this is the incorrect phone number for this locstion"}
{"text":"I agree with the other comments... worst Domino's ever!! I also order a lot of Domino's and this is by far the worse one I've been too. I ordered double pepperoni and there were 3 per slice. I asked for more and they gave me terrible attitude. If you can, go to the one in Laval on Samson instead."}
{"text":"I tend to order a lot of pizza and even thought I have a ton of options, I always find my way back to this Dominos!    If you order online, it's super easy, you can create exactly what you want and see all the specials.  The topping selections are great, what I love is that even though things like chicken and provolone may be considered 'premium toppings', I've never been charged anything extra when I've ordered them (perhaps it's just my magical location?)  Delivery is always prompt and the delivery people are polite and quite friendly."}
{"text":"Won't answer their phone. If they do, they hang up automatically. If this dominos is the only one designated to delivery to you, the other locations won't deliver and therefore you won't ever get a pizza from dominos. Find a new pizza joint"}
{"text":"I just got charged a two dollar \"purchase fee\" for a delivery pizza. Apparently this is only for debit cards. I know for a fact that it costs. nothing to process a debit Transaction and costs a lot to process a credit card.  This is some kind of rip off.  I will never order from Dominos again as long as I live."}
{"text":"This was the worst pizza I've ever had. It was barely worm. Like an idiot I gave the driver a good tip. The cinnamon twists were delicious. So it wasn't all bad."}
{"text":"I used the iPad app to order our order last night. It showed the tracker all the way up to the delivery portion.. The pizza never came so about a half hour later I called. The first time I called the guy who answered the phone didn't care to hear what happened.. And just put in a new order. I checked my email for the first order and I received a confirmation # and they charged my card. So I called back to ask if I'm going to have to pay AGAIN for the pizza (same order 2 different prices btw) naturally they made us pay for the second order. The guy who answered the phone did not give me the time of day AGAIN. And instead of answering \"hello this is dominos..\" The guy answered with \"your pizza is on the way.\" And hung up.. Sooooo that leaves us with  Customer service: 0 stars Don't use the iPad app.    I usually never have a bad experience with Dominos. But I will never order from this particular one ever again."}
{"text":"Most of the time I order Pizza it takes forever for it to get here but not this place.  I called in the order we got 2 Large Brooklyn Style Pizzas 1 with Pepperoni and Sausage the other with Pepperoni & Mushroom for Dessert since my baby had never tried the Chocolate Lava Cakes I ordered 2 of them.  The Guy told me it would be here in 30 minutes or less i timed it was 22 minutes flat.  We will be ordering from them again.  They really out did there selves in order time and time it arrived.  Am gonna have to put this in here I ordered 2 large pizza from another pizza restaurant awhile back not only did they get the order wrong but when I put in a complaint about the order an they made it good with 2 free pizzas, when they brought them out they got the order totally wrong once again. I will not be ordering from PH. no more Dominoes has my business from now own."}
{"text":"Make sure you order your pizza 2 hours before you want it. O and be sure not to pay with a credit card when you order in case you don't get your food at all!"}
{"text":"I came into the store and ordered two baked buffalo chicken sandwiches. The sandwiches were HORRIBLE!!! There was very little chicken, cheese or sauce on the sandwiches. Also, the bread was hard. What a waste of money! Domino's, please take notes from the Charlotte stores and stop being stingy with the chicken, cheese and sauce on your buffalo chicken sandwiches. Very disappointing."}
{"text":"Our family loves the pizzas and chicken dishes we get from this Dominos location. Always hot with lots of cheese and toppings and ready in 10-15 minutes.  Try the chicken with pineapple, jalapenos and cheese.......totally delicious!"}
{"text":"DOMINOS IS THE NEW COMCAT. 2nd Post. If there was a \"Zero Star\" Dominos would get it. Long and loyal customer that ended today. Used iPhone app for a repeat order which included a room number at a local college where this store delivers daily. Bottom line, the delivery guy never delivered because he \"did not\" have the room number, (which he did,) and HE NEVER ENTERED THE BUILDING(!!!) Manager was even worse blaming it on me for not answering my phone. I took it up with corporate, Robin Mc Intrye who fobbed me off with an e-mail ... \"contact manager.\" I responded that I had and it was no help. One month later I again complained to corporate and Robin Mc Intyre called me and basically read from a corporate script. Could not, would not explain to me how a pizza delivery guy would not \"ring the doorbell\" saying that it was for security reasons(?) Really? At a well lit college campus with security running around late night on golf carts, security at the front door, with students all around and I can see the Dominos sign from classrooms? When I pressed for a basic explanation and told him his offer of free pizza was not buying me and reminded him that the college, corporately, orders from this store frequently, he told me I was \"being hostile.\" Just FYI corporate \"customer service\" folk. Never tell an unhappy customer they are hostile and then threaten them with a suggestion that you would close their account. Well, at least he didn't give me the \"F-U\" that the Michigan Dominos manager did as seen in the news this month. Advice: Stand up for the consumer and boycott Dominos. There are plenty of other pizzas places baking great pies."}
{"text":"It's Domino's. You know what to expect. I order here once every other week. My order has always been correct. No complaints. Delivery Driver's are professional, food is hot, and their customer service is about what you'd expect.  REMEMBER TO TIP THE DELIVERY DRIVER. $5.00 OR 20.0% (WHICHEVER IS GREATER!)"}
{"text":"Great Pizza. I have always loved Domino's for Pizza, but would recommend going light on the tomato sauce. Quite often I find the standard sauce overbearing.  Check their specials out if you use Domino's App, quite often there is some good specials to be found."}
{"text":"I'd like to review the pizza but they kept me on hold 15 minutes and never did take me off hold. Their pizza must be good because apparently their phones are too busy to help customers. I'm not sure if this is a good sign or they are just looking to lower their massive 2.5 star rating. Apparently the only way to get an order is to go there. So, I guess I am just rating their phone service."}
{"text":"Ordered a pep and mushroom large for delivery. Got a frozen cold Hawaiian instead. Called to rectify and was told there was nothing they could do  and the wait for the wrong rider took 90 minutes.   Took.tbe pizza back myself and asked to speak to manager. Dudes was rude as hell. Saying that it wasn't they're fault? Unreal. I did eventually get another one but that's after arguing and treating to beat the rude goof with his cold delivered pizza. What a waste. This place is a joke."}
{"text":"********** $9.99 For A 14\" Circle of Crap **********  Nothing but ULTRA THIN cardboard....... The sauce is all, but non-existent.....and tasteless Also....Tasteless cheese.....to boot.  Domino's, Have No Fear ......I'll never be back."}
{"text":"Always The Best! I've ordered pizza, wings, and subs from here before. Sauce is always so thick and tasty, wings are a blast of heaven in every bite, and the subs... cooked to perfection! These men and ladies here, really know what they're doing. My favorite pizza delivery place by far."}
{"text":"I've thought about fast food pizza and Dominos was always one I considered fast good; that being said I was wrong. Their pizza was really impressive. Make sure you get the thin crust xtra sauce and you have some really good pizza! Thanks Dominos!"}
{"text":"Had 1 'dry' pizza in all the years we've been ordering from them...  they corrected it.  Can't find a better pizza place!!!"}
{"text":"THE WORST DOMINOS EVER !!! I ordered a pizza and got a notification from the app that my driver had left the store. Ten minutes later I get a call from the driver Matthew that he had not left yet and would not leave until he verified via phone that he could see my credit card and ID. I have never been asked from any Domino's to verify a credit card and ID, let alone contingent on receiving a pizza. Do they ask you to verify your credit card and ID at a restaurant before you order? How doltish and stupid. I told him I had used my husbands credit card and I didn't have it on me but could show my ID and my credit card. The manager then gets on the phone and says they will not deliver my order then. What the...? When I tried to talk over her she started yelling and said I was yelling at her. Because of this I will never order from any Domino's again. What a disgrace."}
{"text":"second time i tried this place out and ended up with food poisoning for almost a week. do not order from here unless you want to end up in the hospital"}
{"text":"OK, I gave up on Dominos a while ago for better pizza so this was stepping out for me. I had not had a Dominos pizza for a while so I wanted to see if they had improved the quality of their product. I went online to place the order and the process for that was pretty basic and simple. Pretty good site. A large Brooklyn style half extra cheese, half cheese and hamburger for my 8 year old. Also had to try some little chicken/bacon/cheese bites just because.   Ok, I've got to tell you, when the \"pizza tracker\" popped up I had to give them credit for making me feel better about waiting.  Very inventive. I placed the order at 5:01 and got a message that at 5:02 Jason had begun making my order. nice Jason. The tracker told me my order was being prepped, then they were firing up my pizza. A little while later when someone yelled, \"Is the pizza here,\" I said, \"No, the pizza tracker says at 5:16 it was finishing baking and Jason was double checking it for perfection.\" Nice.    Then at 5:25PM. when I'm in the other room watching the playoff game, my computer starting talking to me telling me to be on the lookout for the driver as she, Rachel, had left the store. Oh wait, 5:32PM and Rachel arrived.  That's awesome!! super fast accurate delivery. They crushed everyone else by a long shot.  So for the important stuff.  How did it taste?. Well out of the gate there is really no way any fast food, mass produced company can really make the best pizza for the prices they sell at so that is just a given for me.  That said, while it is not Vinnies neighborhood pizza from Brooklyn, it is pretty great.  The Brooklyn style was a hand tossed much thinner and much more like a NY style pizza. Not a bready as the normal pizza so a plus in my eyes.  They also slice them in larger slices like un north so one big piece almost has you full.  The extra cheese side was better than the regular cheese and hamburger but overall it was much better than I ever remembered and I will use the online service again.  Their service really crushes everyone else and I've got to say that the quality of the food was every bit as good, if not better, than anything else we could have had.  Nice work Dominos. Nice work."}
{"text":"We have ordered multiple times from this place. The few times we have thought about delivery to home, it is a challenge (40 to 60 mins). Not sure if this has improved. However if you order for pickup they are very good. Every time I got there, they have the pizzas ready. The taste for the pizzas we have ordered is what is expected."}
{"text":"This place has terrible customer service with no empathy towards their guests what so ever! The lady on the phone answered and mention they were not doing carry out anymore but it is 12am on a Friday night. They close at 1am! Did not give a reason nor an apology! Her response was just that she only has one driver and they are not doing carry out! I was only asking for one pizza! For PICK UP! No common sense and poor management to not be able to handle these kind of situations properly and having a set staff! Never ordering at this location again!"}
{"text":"Called in to place an order, the lady who answered was extremely rude. She was not only disrespectful to me but also to others as I could hear her shout in the background. I usually don't do this but I will be calling corporate for sure. Horrible customer service!!!"}
{"text":"Ordered Dominos in desperation fairly late on a Sunday night while passing through town on travel. Previous experiences with other locations have been lackluster. Much to my surprise, however, this order was really quite good. Got one of their specialty pizzas on promotion -- spinach and feta -- which was unexpectedly tasty. Ingredients in the garden salad were fresh. Who'd have guessed? Bonus: order online and you can track the status of your order in real time. Cheesy, but fun."}
{"text":"Disgusting! I'd heard they changed the recipe so I thought I would give it a try. How do you make a change and still have a pizza that tastes like the box. What's wrong with these people? Never will I ever go back."}
{"text":"okay i called and orderd but when i gave them my adress they said that we dont deliver there i was like really your down the street wtf !! sorry u lost my bussiness !!"}
{"text":"The worst service ever! These guys are real assholes! I ordered two pizzas and they couldn't even manage to bring me them right! I ordered 1 pep black olive and one sausage and mush. They gave me 2 black olive. I was ok with that at first. I figured I'd just call them and get it cleared up. Um.......nope! As soon as they answer the phone they say, please hold without even giving you a chance to talk. I'm on hold right now after calling for the 22nd time in a row! These guys suck! I'm going to drive down there and get my money back. I should throw their pizza on the floor! That's about what it's worth anyway. The little Ceasars pizza is every bit as good and only costs $5"}
{"text":"Cheap and better than expected.  Location did right by us after our error in ordering a nasty tomato paste no cheese pizza."}
{"text":"Despite the hyperbole of previous reviewers, I didn't find Domino's new pizza to be that bad. The sauce is tastier than I would expect from a chain store, the crust isn't quite as dry as it used to be, and having actual slices of Italian sausage is a nice change of pace.  I wouldn't bother with their wings or sides, and haven't tried the pasta. Frankly, I know better than to order wings from a national chain store.  You can definitely do better. But Domino's is at least on par with Pizza Hut and Papa Johns. If you want the convenience of ordering online and are just looking for pizza, they're fine. If you want to add chicken or get a quality pizza - look elsewhere."}
{"text":"Horrible service, pizza makers answering their cell phones where the store's phone is ringing of the hook. Super unprofessional, never got my order right. What a mess!!!!"}
{"text":"I love this Domino's Pizza location.  The pizza is hot and tasty plus it's done at the time I specify online for pick-up.   Great service too!   There's always someone up front to greet you when you come in."}
{"text":"Worst pizza place in Laveen.  Ordered at 5:00 and got a 20-30 minute wait.  Order showed finished at 5:30.  At 6:00, still no order, so I called the store.  Was told there is only one driver and my order would go out on his next run.  Tried to cancel but she conveniently couldn't hear me any more so I decided to wait it out.    The poor 70 year old driver rolled up at 6:30.  With most of our order, anyway.  I noticed a missing sandwich and caught him before he left, he said they must not have gotten it into the bag and to call the store, let them know, and he'd bring it back out.  Needless to say, the food was lukewarm at best and tasted like you'd expect a dominos pizza to taste after it spent an hour under a heat lamp.    I called them and the phone rang with no answer after nine rings, so I figured I'd just let the driver handle it.  Well, he called soon after asking if I'd called or not, and I told him what happened.  A minute later, someone else called from the store, asking if I wanted a store credit, I let her know I would not be ordering from there again but I'd like a refund for the missing sandwich.  Amazingly, she claimed to be unable to process a refund to a credit card.  I asked to have the sandwich sent out them, since I'd paid for it.  The driver called back again, said he understood the place was awful and he was quitting tonight.  Advised me to call in the morning and ask for the GM.  Which I will do.  Oh, and the sandwich did show up, at 7:18, so there was a happy ending, if a warm sandwich delivered 45 minutes after the rest of dinner could be considered happy.    Never, ever again.  Deleting the app from my iPad in case my lazy butt decides to make this mistake again."}
{"text":"Well it took an hour to get a pizza delivered from a place that is a 5 minute drive. Then the delivery guy was a total freak. Then the pizza was cold and just in general, gross. Good times. Never again."}
{"text":"We have really tried to give this Dominos a chance and they just keep messing up :-(  Today we ordered the exact same order that we always do and we received 1 pizza completely incorrect. After calling Dominos, talking to the manager and being told the driver is who made the mistake, the driver comes back to our house and is so incompetent we can barely communicate with him. Finally after talking to the manger while the driver is at our door they agreed to get us what we wanted and credit us another pizza for later... 20 minutes later the manger calls back to ASK IF WE STILL WANTED THE PIZZA WE HAD ORDERED! Of course we told her yes and from here it's giving to be another 15-20 mins. Wth? Get your store in order lady! Probably won't ever use that credit for the free pizza anyways after this. Don't waste your time or money!"}
{"text":"Pacific veggie pizza with thick crust and marinara sauce was awesome!!! This will become my regular from now on !!"}
{"text":"Their pizza is very good and they update the customers on new deals very well. The public advertising could be better, but all in all a great pizza store. The location is slightly hard to find and the restaurant is small, but the staff is friendly and nice."}
{"text":"Ok, if I could give a negative two stars, I would!! The pizza was horrible. It started online that I would receive it within 35 - 45 minutes. By the time it arrived an hour and fifteen minutes had passed. I asked the driver why it took so long and he rolled his eyes and mumbled something, I still tipped him. The pizza was lukewarm, overcooked, no extra sauce or cheese as I had requested. I will never order Dominoes again!"}
{"text":"I order from this location often. It always arrives promptly and fresh. It's dominos, so it's cheap if not of the highest quality. 2 medium pizzas for $12, worth the $2 bump over little ceasars for cheap pizza."}
{"text":"Never had an issue. Pizza is good for a quick dinner. Delivery is fast, never cold. Friendly and clean staff."}
{"text":"I don't love the crust, but my kids do.  The on-line ordering system is quick and easy.  Love the little guy they have making your pizza on the pizza tracker.    They always get the order right, super fast delivery, and even quicker pick up.   Been going there several years--very frequently.  There were a couple times over the years that the in-store staff wasn't the most polite to my son who went in to pick up the order, but that was over a year ago now.  (To be fair, there were many times that they were very nice to him too.)  Had no personal interaction with the in-store staff for the last year so I am not sure how friendly they are these days.  Delivery people from this store have always been super-friendly.  Price is good if you get an on-line coupon or use their coupons on the website."}
{"text":"I love dominos and this is my own fault but I fell asleep waiting for my pizza and yall should just leave it on the porch cause I was still hungry when I woke up and now I'm down $16. Dominos is bomb tho like definitely underrated"}
{"text":"I come here for the cheap walk-in specials. Always ready when I come to pick it up. Great guy working the back as well. Perfect place to satisfy my \"I-need-to-get-out-of-my-office-and-eat-a-fresh-outta-the-oven-pizza\" cravings."}
{"text":"I placed an order online at 10am (they don't open until 1030) since i had a meeting and wanted to have pizza for lunch.  I requested delivery to be 1145am. At 1215, I thought I would call to see if the order was going to be delivered soon.  The person who answered the phone was extremely rude.  He told me that delivery would take another hour. That meant 1245pm.... (Side note,  when I ordered I requested a call if they didn't think they could deliver on time. If course there was no call so I thought everything would be fine. )  my meeting was going to be over at 1pm, so I really wanted to feed these people beforehand.   The confusing pay wad that The online tracking said The food was out for delivery.... Ughhh.   Well in about 20 minutes the delivery guy finally called to say he couldn't find the address.  Needless to say, I placed this order online with the proper address,  not sure how that could be messed up but it happened.  Overall experience was not pleasant!"}
{"text":"Order for pickup, then made to wait because 'someone didn't put in the chocken? WTF? Why bother having an app if your people don't use the system. Plus pizza was mediocre in texture and greasy. Domino's you turned a treat for my grandson into a hot tired extended walk that left most of the people full, but not pleased with what they ate."}
{"text":"It's a brand new location and so far everything has been really good. I haven't gone to another pizza joint since they opened. Nicely made, tasty pizzas and friendly staff. What's not to like?"}
{"text":"Usually order pickup from here, since I live fairly close enough and don't feel like paying $6+ (delivery fee + tip) to have it delivered.   Frankly, I don't expect any above and beyond service from a chain pizza place like this, but could the employees care any less? Not sure about the answer to that. If you order any sides or extra sauces, make sure to remind them that you ordered them, otherwise they'll let you walk out the door without giving you your complete order. This has happened on more than one occasion.  The last time I went in there may be my last visit for a while. Ordered something simple for pickup, and the employee who rang up my order was nice enough. I always give the driver a tip when ordering delivery, but most often not when I'm picking up (hence what's the point of going through the hassle of picking it up yourself if not to save a few bucks?) But as I was walking towards the door, the employee and her co-worker seemed upset that I didn't leave anything on the 'tip line' of my receipt.  Just left a bad taste in my mouth and negative impression."}
{"text":"Ordered at 6:00 pm. Called at 7:40 and was told that they were \"short stafted\" and that it left 10 minutes ago. Called again at 8:05. They didn't know where it was. given a credit which I probably will not use."}
{"text":"Delivery comes very fast and usually hot but I work 5 mins away it better be!!! Lol food is very mediocre but what can you expect for 10-20 bucks!"}
{"text":"I order pizza all the time and besides local joints my fav, hands down, is dominos! That being said for the last year or so they've had a horrible staff.(I know because I would get pizza almost every sunday during football season)   The bad things; -extremely rude staff -don't answer the phone -put on hold for 20 mins before hang up -1hr -1:30hr wait time (cold pizza) -charging double for pizza (Yes, double!) -driver complains about not getting a tip (after 1+ hr wait and being charged double) -wrong order (pizza cooked different or different pizza all together) -colmpletely forgetting to deliver pizza! The list goes on.....  I will say though....roughly 1-2 months back I noticed a different person answered the phone (polite and professional) and the driver was new + fast and very friendly...The pizza also tasted great....what I was expecting! This location only gets a 2 star because it seems like the owner fired everyone and hired a complete new staff...kudos on taking control! ....had I reviewed this immediately they would have gotten 1 star (becauae 0 isn't an option)   To leave off on a good note they do seem to be improving ... so only time will tell...."}
{"text":"The wings wasn't that great . Other then that delivered on time and very polite delivery guy ."}
{"text":"I won't be using any Domino restaurants again.  I ordered on the phone, they took my credit card, and delivery address.  An hour later 9:30pm, I called them to see where my order was.  First call, they hung up on me.  The second resulted in \"We don't have that order\".   I hope LaQuinta stops handing out there flyer after I inform Corp.  I see from other reviews I am not alone."}
{"text":"Horrible service!!! Stay away from this location I ordered a pizza n cinnamon twist online when it said it was ready for pick up my husband went and they told him they forgot to make it and it was already paid for but the worst part is they told him he had no choice but to wait another 40 min for it he waited and after those 40min told him that they didn't have the cinnamon twist and the pizza it was make since the first order do by this time cold so he need it to take it like this or wait another 40 minutes more. Seriously what us wrong with this people and where is the manager... never going to order from this location ever again .. we end it up cancelling the order this is just not right :("}
{"text":"I can deal with a long delivery time ( it's called being busy, it happens to everyone), I can NOT deal with being lied to TWICE!!!. Called after an hour to check status of delivery, \" Your pizza is on it's way\" (lie). 15 minutes later....same response \" it should be there any minute\" (lie). 10 minutes later....\"So sorry, should be leaving in 15 minutes\" Are you kidding me?  Never again will Domino's receive my patronage."}
{"text":"I keep trying and trying but no matter how many times I still can't get a good pizza at Dominos. I used to like their pizzas but no matter how many chances I give them I still haven't liked one yet.  Maybe someday they'll get me back but I think for now I'm done trying."}
{"text":"They have always done a good job, delivery promptly and have great service."}
{"text":"Boneless chicken was lukewarm and we got regular pizza after ordering thin crust... oof"}
{"text":"Just moved in from Cali and thought we would order some quick pizza. BF ordered cheese pizza and he came back with burnt and pizza with tomato sauce only!!!! Wow! Never again!"}
{"text":"This has been the only Dominos I go to - especially when they mail out 40% off coupons. I order more than I ever should.  The pan pizza is really good! I'm not a huge fan of the regular pizza's, but Ill eat me a greasy pan pizza any day from this place! Delivery is always on time so far!"}
{"text":"This is by far the cleanest and most efficient location for Dominos I have seen in a long time. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"The pizza was cold, doughy, and gelatinous.  It was so disgusting I drove out to the store (after ordering and receiving a delivery, I really didn't want to go anywhere) just to ask for my money back.  The manager refused to even speak to me - he only told his employee to tell me NO REFUNDS.  Yes, he refused to SPEAK TO ME.  The three people who tried this pizza all agreed it was inedible, and we are not fancy folks with snooty palates.  We'll pretty much eat anything.  I felt bad for the young lady up front.  I found it really infuriating that the manager refused to speak with me.  Really terrible management means it's only going to get worse.  My advice, order somewhere else. :("}
{"text":"We ordered online and got the message stating the pizzas were ready. When we got there they were not ready and we had a long wait. When we got home the pizza was a mess and greasy. The toppings were very unevenly distributed and the crust was a mess. I counted 7 yellow peppers on one pizza. Really ? 7?"}
{"text":"This location is great. Good food, no complaints. Usually arrives in less then 45minutes!"}
{"text":"THIS PLACE IS TOPS!   Every time i order from here, it is QUICK, i have only done delivery, but most \"delivery\" places like to take their time, here they get it to you quick! the service is so friendly and giving. I cannot say for a single person because a few different people have brought me my food, and I'll tell you what. They are absolutely awesome and kind. Sometimes I wish i had an extra $20. laying around because they deserve it. keep up the good work guys!"}
{"text":"I cannot tell a lie! GULP. When the urge for a fast, hot pizza happens...and I'm in the area...I give Domino's a call or order online.  It may not be gourmet pizza...but dang it!  The new cheesy bread (which is on special for $5.99 if you order two or more...not that I have recently...) is pure salty, cheesy, flavorful goodness.  It really hits the spot when you're starving and want something utterly not good for your waistline. I also think their new pizza recipe is pretty good.   I like this location because I've never had a problem with the service.  They're always on time when estimating how long it'll take for your order to be ready.  Keep in mind, busy times, like Friday nights or weekends can be super busy, and delivery may take awhile, so plan ahead.   Okay, I'm going to hide my head under the table now...and enjoy my slice."}
{"text":"Always have had good service and decent food when ordering from here. Usually get a pan pizza and steak and cheese hoagie."}
{"text":"Dominos hot wings are my favorite wings! Normally I have a really great experience and am super satisfied, but this location is terrible! I ordered wings from them and they were dry and had almost no hot sauce on them. Also in the past I have gotten pizzas from them that should have had extra cheese, but the cheese was barely speckled on! At least they replaced my food both times for free, but really they should be able to do it right the first time! This is the only location I've ever had problems with though."}
{"text":"Always a wonderful pizza experience!  I need the calories like a hole in the head, but OMG it is so worth it!"}
{"text":"I would give my most recent experience 5 stars....the one before that 1 star but overall 4 stars. What prompted me to review was this last experience. The 1 star experience before that we ordered a handmade pan pizza, the best pizza they've ever had, always fresh. And then tried the Boston pizza I think it was. Supposed to be flat and foldable and big. And we wanted it for leftovers the next day since we were leving town and had no groceries.  Well that Boston pizza was cheeseless, dry and burnt. Terrible. The handmade pan was awesome as always. Well the Boston was like $15 plus tax / delivery etc. so I called and said I would text them a picture, they said no need and gave me a credit of $15. I threw it away which tells you how bad it was since even bad pizza can be eatable.  So tonight is sitter night so I called to get my credit. I stuck with my handmade pan pizza this time. Online said $8.99 each for medium 2-topping. I ordered 2 expecting to pay the difference between my credit and the total.  He said they were actually $7.99 each and he waived the delivery fee. I owed $1.19. He put me on hold and came back and said it was taken care of. 30 mins later 2 perfect hot cheesy fresh pizzas show up.  I tipped the driver well of course and the family was so happy! So I guess with a national chain like dominos, you sometimes expect disappointment as with Pizza Hut or papa johns etc.  Sometimes they get it wrong. But at least this location corrected it with class and didnt even charge the petty $1.19 I owed even though I expected to pay it.  And they have my business again.  And this review. So way to go, you screwed up but then you fixed it even better. See you next time."}
{"text":"Third time ordering online, the tracker says its on its way then 10 min later someone calls & says they dont have a salad but my food was on the way 10 min ago first off. Second, how you make my pizza? Not knowing if ima cancel my order or not? Get it together. Fail ....."}
{"text":"This is my 3rd visit to this location. It is in the same shopping center as Petco and Colleen's. Usually we get the stuffed cheesy bread this time we got a large pepperoni, sausage, and spinach for 7.99 and it was delicious! Not too greasy like most pizzas and it was ready for carry out in 15 min! We will be back thanks guys!"}
{"text":"My company ordered lunch from here.  The pizza was doughy but it turned out to be a semi-workout for the jaw muscles as I had to keep chewing and chewing.  Some tomato paste was isolated in one area and it tasted overly sweet.  I haven't had pizza for a while. When I returned, I went to Regino's first but thought maybe all chains were of this high quality. This is not the case, as this pizza is noticeably inferior though it was not bad, simply mediocre and not great.  After comparing pizza prices, Regino's is coming out on time as it is one of the cheapest while being one of the highest in quality too.  3 stars. 6.75/10"}
{"text":"Ordered pizza online but we had to pick it up late. We called to let them know and they actually kept the pizza warm on the hot rack! Recommend brooklyn style pepperoni. Friendly service."}
{"text":"The pizza was really awful tasting and they wrote in their own tip over the one I wrote on the receipt. Called and emailed to complain but never heard back. Had to dispute with my card company. Dominos will never get my business again."}
{"text":"This is the WORST Dominos I have ever dealt with. I have never had an accurate order, ever, and when calling about the problem, the [weekend] manager is the worst person. And I have had plenty of decent Dominos experiences. In other states.   Every single time I have got delivery, something is ALWAYS forgotten or made wrong. We frequent the Dog Bar and get delivery there at least once a week. The pizza tracker app is easy- that's it.  The last time, our delivery guy tried to fix the forgotten items, but the manager said it wasn't (her?) problem, and proceeded to chew out the delivery guy (he did absolutely nothing wrong, I feel terrible he has to work for this person and am calling corp the second they open Monday morning).  Long story short: don't bother to order from here, they will forget stuff, call you a liar, and not fix the situation. The manager is obviously verbally abusive to employees, the second time we saw our delivery guy today he had been extremely yelled at for NOTHING. I felt guilty for asking for my forgotten items since he was accosted for whoever made the food poorly. He was really nice though, and obviously tried.      Weekend manager is a pyscho. Forget this place."}
{"text":"This place is a joke. I ordered at 530p didn't get my order till 630p on top of the hour the order was wrong. when we called to complain, was put on hold 3 separate time in the same phone call. after hanging up and calling back we were told a new pizza was on the way. 800p rolls around no pizza. took another phone call and 30 mins to get the right pizza. I work hard for my money, I know they do to, but when im spending 20bucks of my hard earned cash I want what I ordered. WTF!!"}
{"text":"Had terrible experiences with this location. My last was the final straw.  An hour and half later with multiple calls to the store with no answer.  I finally got ahold of someone and got rude and ignorant response to why our pizza was taking so long.  When the pizza made it to our house they had no receipt.  They said they were going to sign it for me and to let him know how much to leave for tip??? 1 pizza had no sauce, both were cold, and we couldn't prove it, but there was definitely a hair in one of the pizzas.  Tried to get money back after multiple calls again, and manager refused to take phone call and sent it to a automated system.  Called corporate office to complain and they said they would have franchise owner get back to me.  Still didn't get a call.  Sent an email to corporate again and finally got a call.  From the manager you ask?  Nope the kid thst took my order apologing offering me a $30 credit.  After refusing it saying we will never go back we just want our money back, he said it wasn't possible since it was on a different day.  Then I told him I would dispute it with my bank and let them go after them due to me not actually signing receipt and what they did was illegal.  He then replied he would have a manager call me.  10 min later same kid calls back and said his manager approved a refund.  Manager and owner refused to talk to me.  Horrible business.  I don't ever right reviews, but I thought everyone should know my experience.  We will NEVER EVER  order from them again"}
{"text":"If you are ordering for lunch - definitely think again.  We are Domino's fans - but the last THREE times I have ordered online and scheduled my delivery for a specific time - well over an hour from the time I had hoped it would be there - ALL THREE times it arrived more than 20 minutes late.  When I call to find out where my pizza is, or to let the manager know that there was an issue - the response is - we are very busy.  Eventually I get a \"Sorry\", but it seems like I have to beg for that!  VERY POORLY MANAGED STORE - TIME WISE AND CUSTOMER SERVICE WISE"}
{"text":"Today I took the time to read all the reviews for this particular Domino's restaurant. I'm sad to find that some people have had bad experiences. I have been very lucky! The online ordering system allows me to track my food and it comes delivered piping hot and delicious. I've never visited the restaurant and can only assume they meet health code. They have never been mentioned on Dirty Dining, so I'm happy with that. Luis and Erasmo make delicious pizza and the two delivery men have always been very polite. I have no complaints and am very happy with this Domino's Restaurant and how they take care of me."}
{"text":"So far I have not had a bad experience with this Dominos location. The pizza and chicken has always been fresh and hot. I think Dominos has vastly improved their taste and ingredients over the last few years The Brooklyn style pizza is my favorite."}
{"text":"This place isn't even professional at all. They have ghosts \"taking\" orders for them. Called in an order and was told 30-45 mins. Waited patiently for about an hour and they still hadn't delivered my food. I decided to call back and they didn't even have an order for me! They even admitted they were having issues with their ordering however they were closed for about 30 mins so they wouldn't be able to deliver our food. Thanks for nothing DP. I will not be ordering from there anymore."}
{"text":"THEY DO NOT HONOR COUPONS!!!  Second time in a row a tried using coupons and had problems.  I tried ordering online using the coupon code (AP1999) and although the coupon said you get 3 toppings on your 2 large pizzas, it was charging me for the 2nd and 3rd toppings.  I then decided to call the store and order through them so I could get the correct price on the coupon.  The employee tells me the price is higher than the coupon in his system so the coupon I have must be expired.  Since it only said limited time on it, I accepted that explanation even though it did not say expired online.  I had to pay for those additional toppings and then when my pizza arrived - the same coupon was given to me again with my pizzas!!  I called back then to complain and I believe I got the same rude employee who this time actually yelled at me on the phone telling me the price he charged me was correct because that is what came up in the system.  I kept saying that the coupon shows a different price and he kept snapping at me as if I didn't understand.  Then what I assume is the manager gets on the phone and agrees the coupon is not expired and says the employee must have made a mistake.  I said that I want my charge corrected then because I am not paying more for his mistake.  This person then got rude and just said when I make my next order to tell them \"Jason said I get a discount on this one\".  Yeah - like that is going to work.  And I am not ordering from them again anyways after being treated that way.  This branch really needs some intervention from corporate on how to treat their customers and on how to honor coupons they send out - as again, this was the second time in a row they gave me problems with coupons they brought to my house!!"}
{"text":"Terrible service!! Stood there waiting to order with three people behind the counter. No one greeted me nor said a word. I'll never go back!"}
{"text":"I don't order from this dominos anymore.  The reason?  I could never get off hold whenever I called to place an order.  I have to drive 6 miles each way out of my way to pick up from another domino's.  One time I left my phone on speaker just to see how long I would be on hold.  I hung up after 10 minutes.  Terrible."}
{"text":"Poor made pizza's... they forgot the cheese on half of the pizza. Then the worse part was when I called to complain made me feel like I was lying. The guys who answered the phone place me on hold few times before even agreeing to send me new pizza's. So I asked for the manager and she wasn't any better, they asked for the pizza's back, like really sry my kids n myself are gonna eat a few slices cause we re hungry! And will have to wait for the new pizza's to arrive. Never experienced such bad customer service and pizza's from dominos, it must be this location reflection of mgmt here."}
{"text":"This place seems to have the worst customer service all the time. Today we walked in and we greeted the employees and all they did was stare at us so awkwardly if anything it should be them greeting us. One of them was a chubby guy who had earphones on the whole time listening to music! First off that should be a health hazard and not allowed by management. Secondly my pizza was made by a guy with blonde hair and the tomato sauce was dry as well for the toppings there wasn't even any. Lastly it seems as if management should be SUPERVISING the team more often so things like this don't occur. I didn't seem to have seen a manager to be acting professional towards their customers in this facility! This is just horrible"}
{"text":"If you don't mind waiting an hour for cold, burnt pizza, this is your place! Better yet, call to ask why the Tracker said your pizza was being checked for 40 minutes. After they put the phone on their counter for almost 10 minutes, then realize you're there, they'll tell you that the Tracker isn't accurate anyway. But my stone cold pizza tells me otherwise."}
{"text":"Got food poisoning after eating two slices of a large 3 topping pizza with bacon, olives, and pepperoni. Not how I was planing to spend my vacation):"}
{"text":"Years ago I quit going to dominos due to poor quality and lousy service... This location has made me a customer again. The food is so good , and the delivery so quick, I can't believe it's the same place."}
{"text":"It's been awhile since I've been to a Domino's, so I thought I would stop by this location since I was in the area. The pizza at Domino's has usually been great despite the huge PR disaster the company had back 7 years ago thanks to a couple of employees who have been filmed in disgusting acts to food being made for customers.  I ordered a specialty pizza seeing that I never ordered one from Domino's in the past. Order was simple....or as it seemed. Minutes after placing my order, I looked through one of their flyers on the counter, and noticed that they were running a special with the pizza I had just ordered along with some wings and drinks, which turned out to be much cheaper. When I asked the cashier who took my order to have it changed to the promo they were running, I was told that it was too late since they already started making the pizza and it was paid for.  I couldn't make sense of what he just told me. They only started spreading the sauce and cheese on the pizza when I wanted to change my order.  \"How come you didn't tell me about this promotion?\"  He shrugged his shoulders and told me he could offer me some free dipping sauce. Are you kidding!?  The savings on the promo was much more than the cost of the dipping sauce he was offering! I was busy running other errands in the area, so I didn't really have the time to give this guy a piece of my mind.  All in all, the pizza was good, but the customer service NEEDS A LOT of improvement.  If this is the treatment towards all customers, this location deserves to be closed. Permanently."}
{"text":"Usually a pizza place is just like any ordinary place you order from, but I've never had the service I've had at this location, which is by far the best service. For example, I had mistakenly thought the pizza I was given was the wrong kind, turns out the crust was just made a little differently and the manager got on the phone and said he'd personally come and deliver a brand new pizza himself (we didn't get delivery on the original pizza) with no cost at all. Second time, they ran out of lava cakes so we decided we would cancel and go to another location, the manager ended up going to the nearest location and bringing us the lava cakes at the crowfoot location. Honestly it's the little things that count! I hope he knows those things don't go unnoticed."}
{"text":"Évidemment, comme dans tous les Domino's pizza, la pizza est bonne, mais OUFFF! le service à la clientèle, ça n'a pas l'air facile!  Quand je suis entrée dans le magasin et que je me suis postée au comptoir pour commander, il était trois membres du personnel et j'étais la seule cliente et ça a pris 5 minutes avant que quelqu'un vienne me voir. Il se relançait la balle du genre \"vas-y toi\" \"il y a quelqu'un tu devrais y aller\". Vous vous doutez que celui qui a écopé de la tâche de venir me servir n'était pas des plus souriant d'avoir été dérangé...  Fait intéressant par contre: l'endroit offre des pizzas sans gluten! Elles ne sont disponibles que dans le plus petits formats et sont un peu plus chères, mais quel bonheur de pouvoir manger de la pizza sans le mal de ventre qui vient avec!"}
{"text":"Ordered online and that was simple enough and this was the second time eating there because it was so good the first time! BUT this time the pizza was terrible! We ordered extra pepperoni and one of the slices had none and it just seemed. Like a normal amount but worse than that was how much grease  had soaked the bottom of the box. It made the pizza very hard to eat. I was very disappointed- not sure we will try it again."}
{"text":"I tried to give this place a second Chance after they delivered my pizza cold the first time. Yet again I got my pizza and it was cold and it tasted like it's been sitting out instead of tasting fresh.   Done with this place never again will I order here again. Little ceasars is way cheaper and their pizza tastes way better than this."}
{"text":"Worst pizza going experience!! Ordered o line and came to the store to pick up when ready. After frantically looking for my pizzas I was told that the driver accidentally took the pizzas with him. Underwhelmed does not describe this experience. Ugh!!!!! Lesson learned! The stuttering general manager was 12 years old too!"}
{"text":"It seems this branch can't get it right if their life depends on it. They alway seem to leave off items. Dounle this, NO Extra that NO, even when you pay extra youn don't get it. They use those tunnel ovens and when they get busy the crank up the speed and heat. And everything goes from brown to black."}
{"text":"The worst customer service and when I asked to talk to a manager, a man with the name Trey stated he was. He argued telling me I did not talk to him when I stated he hung up on me when I asked if they deliver. When I called back I asked if they deliver and the person gave attitude when he gave the price, as if I couldn't afford a 1 item large pizza.  I will never order pizza from this place again."}
{"text":"Took an hour and a half to get a pizza delivered half a mile.   Franchise didn't care,  corporate didn't care, this location is awful.   Domino's used to have thirty minute delivery,  with far less technology than we have today, how can this be so simple and yet so impossible.   Papa Johns is three times as far away and got here in 20 minutes.  Enough said.  9/20/2014 update.  Emailed corporate directly to express dissatisfaction with this store and never heard back.  They don't even respond to bad Yelp reviews.   Good luck Dominos."}
{"text":"Driver was out for delivery so over 20 minutes  I live half mile away from them so needless to say the pizza was cold and gross and no in a heat bag."}
{"text":"Delivery was fast. It came in 30 minutes. We ordered the Bbq chicken feast pizza and Canadiana (bacon, pepperoni and mushrooms). We ordered on-line two medium size pizzas and honey garlic chicken wings. The wings were soaking in a lot of sauce and delicious. The pizzas were fresh and delicious."}
{"text":"This Dominos location is great! They have the friendliest drivers and the food is always excellent. I have had almost everything on the menu over the last year and they NEVER disappoint. Most recently they forgot a bleu cheese for my wings but the driver was so gracious to go back to the store and get one after I insisted that it was not a big deal and he didn't have to.   This Domino's is definitely my go-to for pizza and will be as long as they keep up the excellent service!"}
{"text":"I only give Dominos a second star because I love the pizza, but the customer service at this location is enough to make me give my money to Pizza Hut, Nellos, Papa Johns, or any of the other countless pizza joints within a 2 block radius.  My first experience at this location, I walked in and the manager was straight rude the entire time...even told me the pizza is not supposed to look like the picture..shortly after they came out with their take a picture promotion..lol joke was on him I guess. The district manager called me back and basically argued with me over the service I received.  I decided to go back last night (over a year later) to try my hand again.  Walked in, manager is still the same, one employee was standing staring at the computer screen in front of my face, said nothing.  3 other employees walk up and stare at the same computer screen, again nothing. Mind you I am standing 5 feet away from them with the counter and glass separating us.  They all have looked at me by now and are staring back at the computer screen.  Must be something super interesting.  Finally about 3 minutes later, one looks up at me again and says \"someone help her\".  About a minute later one of them finally looks at me with a \" What do you want?\" look on his face.  I said I am here to pick up an order for Megan Williams.  One looks for my pizza hands it to me and they all just go about their  business.  Not one word was spoken to me by any of the 4 employees in the store.  No thank you, have a nice night, thanks for the order, NADA!  OMG I have never experienced anything like that in my life and I have had some baaaaad experiences.  The staff at this location needs to be torn down from the bottom up and rebuilt.  There is better pizza around and closer. I suggest Nellos.  A bit pricier but the pizza is unique and the service is always awesome.  Very friendly...worth the extra money... If you are looking for cheap go with Lil Ceasers They are close as well"}
{"text":"We ordered our food and per the tracker it was being delivered...however it never showed up. No one answered when we called even though we were charged for the food that we never received. Who runs a business like that?"}
{"text":"Just had one of the worst pizzas in my life and I am married to an Italian so I have had a lot of pizza in 35 years.  Never order the thin crust unless you want warmed over cardboard with some kind of mystery cheese(?) if it was cheese.  Bake a frozen pizza you will be better off.  Domino's shame on you"}
{"text":"Fast pizza and great prices but pizza not so good. Won't be coming back because staff is rude. But good if your on a budget"}
{"text":"We ordered a couple medium pizzas today for our family and my nephew found a piece of plastic foil melted in the cheese. Usually a fan of dominos but this is gross! I could only imagine if someone had ate it. Very disturbing. Will definitely think twice before ordering here again!"}
{"text":"We ordered our pizza with an estimated arrival time of 20-30 mins. After an hour I finally reached a manager who stated the driver was new and should have been on his way a while ago. I told him I would like hot pizzas and they apologized and said the would remake them. An additional 45 mins later a driver shows up and asks us how we wanted to pay. At that point he tells us the card that was charged was cancelled and we can either give him the card again or pay cash. This is the worst delivery service I have ever experienced and at all costs possible will order from any other pizza place in the area. When the mistake is on their end they should have the responsibility of pleasing the customer and not make it more difficult for their customers."}
{"text":"I went there today at 4pm walked in and no one greeted me, I walked up to the counter as I was gonna order something but NO ONE came to the front to take my order. I stood there for a bit thinking someone was gonna come, but I guess not. I walked out .. They seriously need to learn more customer service. NEVER going there again!!!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I just ordered from here and they gave me the wrong order and the lady who i spoke to on the phone about it does not have any manners and hung up on me after being extremely rude.  They need to learn customer service.  I will never order from here again. EVER!"}
{"text":"Ordered pizza and cheese bread tonight arrived 1:20 later with some type of cinnamon sticks. Long wait wrong order. Next time order Joe Mommas or Luigis and pick up my fault for being lazy."}
{"text":"Quick and friendly delivery.  I prefer thin and crispy crust pizza.  This was perfect and delicious.  I ate more of it than I would of other pizza brands.  The marble brownies are delicious too!"}
{"text":"Recently this location started delivering to my house for my online orders instead of another Dominos location.  My orders arrive slower despite the location being closer.  They forget ingredients such as the parmesan butter coating on the crust.  They also run out of ingredients, which means I have to change my order and handle the price difference in cash because I already paid online and the store cannot reverse the charge.  They are very nice, and try their best to work around these issues, but there is definitely some room for improvement."}
{"text":"I've had bad and average experiences here. Nothing special but they usually get my order right. Twice I've had mix ups with delivery and the manager Sally has terrible customer service skills but it's not horrible enough to keep me from ordering again. If there was another choice in the area I would most likely utilize it."}
{"text":"Worst Dominoes ever! - I make my order and everything goes fine, then I see that the online tracker is saying that my order had been delivered.... so I call the branch and they give me some excuse about the driver having to go back for another order or whatever. They finally get around to bringing me my order (which I had to go down and get since they don't do apartments) and ITS COLD, so not only did I just wait OVER AN HOUR but I just waited over an hour for cold, $25 pizza. Best part? I live 5 minutes away from them. I might as well have walked and picked the stupid pizza up myself."}
{"text":"Horrible customer service. Called before midnight and they hung up on me so they would not have to fulfill my order"}
{"text":"Just when I think I will give them another try,  they make the same mistake again.  I order pasta always with extra sauce. And every time,  they forget the sauce altogether.  They ask me if I want a credit, but why would I want a credit when I'm hungry now ?"}
{"text":"It took over an hour to get pizza delivered, I ordered at 3:17 p.m. (not a busy time of day) was delivered at 4:27 p.m. and I live right up the street. Pizza wasn't even warm even though it's hot temperature outside. Very disappointing"}
{"text":"Always fresh and always delicious.  This is the only place that delivered and understood instructions. Every other place completely ignores my message about which door to deliver."}
{"text":"Great customer service. Pizza was great! Much better than the raw pizza from Pizza Hut!  Place is clean and very inviting. Obviously more for carry out or delivery, but nice large waiting area."}
{"text":"They must have gotten new owners because this place just isn't the same. When they first opened the toppings were great! I like mushrooms and pepperoni on my pizza and they would COVER it, some of the best Pizza I have ever had... back then.  This locations is still fairly new to the Lakeshore neighborhood, but due to their walk-in specials, pretty much everyone goes here instead of the Pizza Pizza across the street, or at least they did. This is my \"last resort go-to\" for pizza by the lake, each time has been more and more of a disappointment.  They even burned my pizza once to the point that the crust was black, and still put it in a box and had it waiting for me. Always check your pizza when picking it up.  I'm seriously waiting for a hairnet to be my next topping."}
{"text":"1 mile from the store and takes 1.5 hours to come. Pizza arrived cold, like cardboard and was reheated. The thermal order paper on it had turned black due to the heat, thus was a giveaway."}
{"text":"As Domino's goes, this is a good location for both carryout and delivery. If they've ever made a mistake, they've cured it promptly. Don't usually see the same staff twice on carryouts, but they're always friendly and accurate."}
{"text":"The guy at the front was amazing!  I had accidentally ordered the wrong thing and he was very sweet and remade my order no questions asked.  Very nice and great customer service.  Thank you!"}
{"text":"Don't order anything for delivery from here! The last 2 times I ordered it took 2 hours for them to deliver the food and it was cold. Worst service ever."}
{"text":"Definitely happy they finally opened a better pizza place around this area, especially since there's literally zero decent places to eat that doesn't look sketchy. I was quite pleased with the awesome promotions they had going on for their grand opening, and also the service is great! Super fast and because we come frequently, they already know my order   Everything about this place I love except the parking. It's always a gong show just to get into the actual parking lot. It's fairly small and there isn't a lot of room which has nothing to do with Dominos, but the actual architecture of the place is awful!   There has never been an issue with my pizza because I always order the same thing. Everyone knows us by name, they're all really nice, hardworking folk."}
{"text":"Ordered 10 pizza's for a company event.  Every single pizza was shaken up....will not order again. From this place.  Yes they wanted to replace but an hour after my associates lunch.. to late to redeem yourselves....train your associates correctly next time!"}
{"text":"Just got a cold pizza . Folks made me wait for 15 mins before handing over.. my total order time was 35 mins. This has been a common complaint now at this center .. probably will try a new location next time."}
{"text":"For the price this is really a 5 star pizza. However I view Grimaldi's as the standard in Las Vegas. Problem is Grimaldi's is expensive and don't deliver to our home.   The only other thing I wish - Dominos PLEASE offer the old crust as an option. THAT would get you five stars from me :)"}
{"text":"5 times ordering delivery and 5 times failing to deliver my complete order.  I called after placing my order online to remind them for the fifth time to include the sauce I ordered. Once again they forgot.  I called back and after explaining this repeated mistake to the manager and they tried to offer a credit for the next order or comp the current incomplete order.  I just want my food with my sauce and they were unwilling to do that tonight. Why would you let a restaurant bend you over a sixth time?  They have lost 2 dominos customers. Go to Benny Penellos up the street and don't waste your time here."}
{"text":"Pay no attention to the comments below. The pizza is cooked to perfection. It tastes better than what was in the past. Every employee that I come across at this location are very friendly. Also the store is clean and so are the restrooms."}
{"text":"I order from here every week. They do an awesome job. Occasionally my pizza is a little cool, but I never have a mistake. They just hired a new guy, Sean, he's young but has an amazing attitude and work ethic. I would recommend this location."}
{"text":"I won't ever order here again!  We followed the online status of our food and 40 minutes after it left the store we still didn't have our food.  When I called they were no help.  I never cared much for dominos any ways, but gave them another chance as my family likes them.  No more.  It was well over an hour from ordering, we left and got food somewhere else!"}
{"text":"AVOID!   The management and workers are so rude and incompetent. I ordered my food at 7:54 and it got to me at 9:32. I called 5 times and they were rude each time and seemed like they did not care at all.  The delivery driver claimed he had called me and I did not answer so he left. Unfortunately that is far from the truth bc I had the pleasure of speaking to him and getting hung up on. I tried to call him back 5 times and my call got ignored each time. I called the place again and they told me I did not answer my phone or come out when he was there. I sat outside for 25 minutes in the snow just to prove I was outside. While on the phone with them the driver called in to say he was here but this time since I was waiting outside I could confirm he was not there. I received no type of apology after being blamed for not being outside or opening the door. Eventually I had to walk and meet him at the end of my street because he was not able or lazy. I called back because obviously after an hour my pizza was cold and after offering me a credit (which means i have to order from this shit hole  again)  and before hanging up the person on the other line slipped in \" make sure you answer your phone next time.\" They are so rude and unprofessional. When I decide to use my credit i will go there and order when I get there, so I can watch them make it. This way they cant spit in my food, which seems like the type of people they are.    Go to the dominos in south side!"}
{"text":"I called first to ask about what was the cost to get some wings and parm bites ,they where professional and I said I would call back when I was ready.When I made up my mind I decided to drive to the store because I had seen the reviews and I wanted to make sure this was a good place to get food from. I came here and the girl was very polite and took my order and everything was perfect.  The store is very clean! I will definitely return!"}
{"text":"Really good, reasonably priced pizza. I love Dominos since the change however long ago. Plus it is FAST!!!! When three kids are \"Starving\" its a great place to look. We had the new bread bites.. Well worth the $1.00. If you are comparing to premium pizza places it certainly does not compare but if you are looking for good food, at a good price, fast it is  a great place. Dominos delivers everything you expect from them."}
{"text":"This Domino's rocks.  Extremely pleasant people answer the phone and deliver your meals.  I love the pizza tracker and their App works fantastic. We order delivery from them at least once a month.  We like that they have a variety of crusts and sauces.  Their $5.99 medium two topping pizzas are a steal."}
{"text":"My daughter loves dominos, it has to be pepperoni and hand tossed. Every time I ordered a pizza it was easy online, fast, hot and yummy. Thank you Dominos, your great."}
{"text":"Horrible customer service. Esp on a day like Super Bowl Sunday. I placed an order online and they will not deliver because I do not have less than a 100 bill. I am unfortunately HANDICAPPED. I even asked to speak with the manager to respectfully request that they make an exception due to my sensitive situation. He said I'm sorry no matter the circumstance we cannot deliver. I asked him if I did not request that the driver has change for 100 and they delivered and I didnt have anything smaller than a 100 that they would TAKE THE FOOD BACK. HE SAID YES THEY WOULD TAKE THE FOOD BACK!!! As a manager you're going to walk away from a sale on Super Bowl Sunday?!!!! I guess I'm not eating anything today. I'm just going to go hungry. OK! DOMINOS"}
{"text":"I haven't had bad service from this location they are alil slow to deliver but anyways this review is because dominos has advertised online that if I place my order before 12 am that I'll still get it so last night I placed a order at 11:59 I know it's somthing but technically it's still before 12 am so my order went threw and everything went ok until I got a call from them saying they were closed so they cancelled my order this is b.s. Dominos smh"}
{"text":"Great pizza, well made!!! The pizza holds it form, not to many topping nor to little  I order the BBQ chicken that was good but it can in a cardboard box with no liner kinda made it feel not very professional, maybe throw a liner in under the chicken instead of the chicken laying on the cardboard.  Other then that great job Dominos your food and care for it for the customer beat Pizza Hut that's right down the street from you.  4 stars, would of gave 5 if there was a liner under the chicken pieces."}
{"text":"I have to tell the story. I never have a dominos since last 10years.cause my experience wasnt good.dry cheap pizza.but when i try a domino about 6monthes ago. I was very impessed.taste was good,service was good. Since then i like to pick up dominos.today after work,i order pizza to pick up at 8:58pm using app.it shows my pizza in the oven at 9:00.i got there at 9:08.i pay 11.90 with cash.usually i tip then 2.00 but i needs changes tommorow .i decide not tip them.thats it.lady took the money was in back by oven someone call that my pizza was done at 9:10. I was waiting,waiting.   finally when  the lady took my money to go out for delivery she handed my pizza that was cold at 9:18.  Of cause pizza wasnt taste good. Half of them i throw away.thats it dominos.adios never."}
{"text":"Took over an hour to deliver... AND they forgot the dipping sauce! I hate when that happens.  Plus the green pepper toppings were a sad affair."}
{"text":"Horrible Dominos! They forgot an item from my order and when I called about it, the way they offered to resolve the situation was like it was my fault.. I should've stuck with my instincts and went for Pizza Hut!   Oh by the way, their pizza is so effin SALTY!! Yuck!!!"}
{"text":"Buncha haters. I would starve without these lovely guys. Everything is always delicious, hot, delicious, and imo pretty durn fast. The delivery guys/gals are also very nice and have gone out of their way to make sure I've got everything I need. It's a pizza delivery shop, and like every other restaurant there will be \"busy days\" when your pizza might not be there in exactly 30 minutes. Ever been a pizza delivery person? It's stressful! I've been ordering from them forever and have always been super happy. Thank you for feeding me guys!"}
{"text":"We've ordered pizza two times for us and once, as a gift, for the apartment office for the complex where we live. The food was standard Domino's - not bad at all.  But the service is why I only gave them two stars. The time I was at their store here to order pizza for the admin folks, of the two employees at the store at 11:00 a.m., one was a trainee and the other was a very angry, sarcastic woman who was constantly yelling at the trainee. It was so uncomfortable to witness. The second time I called the store and got the angry woman, I think. At least, she had the same demeanor. She was abrupt and I had to ask a question more than once to be heard irritating her no end. I eventually canceled the order so she'd stop acting like I disturbed her day. My husband ordered a pizza this past Friday and a store employee called back to ask how much tip he was going to give the driver. Unbelievable!"}
{"text":"The food is alright for the price. But the customer service is crap!!!! The employee's specifically the employee named Abby was so rude. She rolled her eyes and gave attitude to everybody!!!! The environment is very stressful"}
{"text":"Order online and track your delivery!  Except it was 20 minutes later than the tracking said they left the store.  Dominos is pretty consistent with their pizza.  We ordered 2 medium 2 topping pizzas $5.99 each and then $9.99 for 14 wings.  Bill came to $26 so I am guessing there was a delivery fee which I failed to check.   Pizza #1 - Thin crust, extra bbq sauce, chicken and pineapple.  It was perfect.  I wish I had some right now.  Pizza #2 - regular crust, extra Robust tomato sauce with jalepenos and pineapple.  It was pretty good though I preferred the other.  Wings - Spicy and \"slimy\".  I don't know what it is with these places.  Seems I have only had non-slimy wings from our friends at BWW. Hm.  (anyways grilled them up and they were better)  All in all this is Dominos-nothing real special -just the usual chain place pizza. Nothin too crazay.... its just a \"quick lets order some fast pizza cuz I don't want to cook right now\" place."}
{"text":"We stayed at the microtel for our 2nd time. Last time we were there we ate at brunos and it was horrendous. The service was awful and the food was even worse. So we decided to go with a well known name \"DOMINO'S\" I have to say that this was not a disappointment. The food was delicious, hot, and fast. They had this to our hotel room in a very short time. I would highly recommend Domino's of Streetsboro if your afraid to try to locals."}
{"text":"I used to order from here at least once a week. We used to get great service and our food was always hot and fresh and correct. Then they started forgetting our sauces every time we'd order. This last time I ordered though was far the worst. I won't ever be order from them again. Their food is terrible and has gone down in quality and their management does not care"}
{"text":"Nice staff and friendly service!! I ordered my pizza without cheese - they called to make sure that was correct before making it. Very efficient!"}
{"text":"Ordered a pizza to a nearby hotel and they never delivered it and charged my card... Not sure what kind of scam they have going on. Beware of this place."}
{"text":"Some people say you should go to Bianco's, others say Cibo, but ya know what, if someone gave you a slice of Dominoes, but they say that they got it from a new high end boutique pizza place, you would think that it was the greatest thing you had ever eaten. The pizza and service at this location is fantastic."}
{"text":"Not happy with this place at all! Placed my order online last night and even paid for it. When I got there is was ready for pick up. My order was easy two medium pizza's, one pepperoni and the other jalapeño and pepperoni. And a side of hot wings. When we got home, I gave my 5 year old and 16 month old each a slice of pepperoni pizza, only to hear them screaming seconds later because it was spicy hot! The entire pepperoni had diced jalapeños under the cheese so it was not visible to the eye. Unlike the other jalapeño pizza that had big jalapeños on it. When we called to complain all they did was credit us two pizzas. Not happy with that, and why were the jalapeños not visible to the eye like the other pizza I ordered!"}
{"text":"Pretty sure the pizza I just got was a cheese pizza at least a couples hours old with my topping put on top and put back in the toaster. Disgusting!!!! I was tracking my pizza online as soon as it was ready I picked it up, the crust was hard, sauce was dry and the cheese was cool! Very disappointing, I would have been better off going to Albertsons and getting a frozen pizza!!!"}
{"text":"Would give this location a zero star if possible.  Worst manager customer service ever. We usually like the convenience of delivery,  but the management at this location was so rude NEVER AGAIN."}
{"text":"I wish I could give this less than one star. Tonight is the second time in a row that our pizza is totally wrong. When I called tonight to complain a rude teenager named Isabelle then told me to dig threw the pizza to look for pepperoni?.. that wasn't even the issue. There were hot peppers all over it and the wrong toppers and I have a toddler eating it.. hot peppers and toddlers don't mix. Then I was transfered to the \" manager\" Tony.. he was even worse then the teenager telling me I've called complaining before so he made the pizza himself and that it isn't wrong...well Tony I'm not lying..but wait It gets worse tho.. he then continuously talks over me  telling me if I order again he refuses to make the pizza and then told me I ordered hot peppers.. I ordered online and screen shot what I asked for and then took a pic of what was delivered. Customer service is awful.  You can barely understand the manager . He doesn't make any sense whatsoever. We won't be ordering from Dominoes ever again ( and we order alot).. this location and horrible service totally ruined it. They're rude and incompetent.  I've already called head office because that's how shocked I was at tonight's experience"}
{"text":"Worst service everrrr!!!!!! called 2 hours ago for pizza and breadsticks...get my food an hour later and no marinara sauce for the breadsticks..so i call back and they said they'll have someone come right back...over an hour later...still no marinara sauce..breadsticks are now cold..FINALLY after calling back THREE times, someone is \"supposedly\" on their way...horrible service..didnt even offer a discount or credit...i dont know what kind of ppl they have working there, but its not that difficult...wont be ordering from here again..."}
{"text":"if I could give negative stars I would. Amanda needs to work on her customer service. trying to convince me to not order because deliveries take 2hrs? well I didnt mind the wait since my family doesnt eat dinner til 1130 anyway, well 4hrs later and they are now closed. I called multiple times to check on my order the last was at 1130 , 30 mins before they close so of course you can understand my frustration when she said the driver is on the way with no sympathy of my situation or any help whatsoever (didnt call the driver, call back to update, etc) welp of course now they're closed and I'm pretty sure I'm getting screwed over since my order was not delivered, I paid on my card (who knows if ill get my money back) , and I waited all this time waiting for my supposed dinner .. I'm livid. never ordering here again, and I suggest you save your money and go else where. f*** dominos pizza. lesson learned."}
{"text":"After a 40 min wait for delivery - I live 5 mins from this store - I'm warming my thin crust veggie pizza in the microwave. My husband's pasta bowl is less than fresh; everything (incl chicken wings) is warm-ish at best. I called twice, spoke to 2 different guys trying to track my order, who both told me its out for delivery now. The driver had a total of 2 orders; he drove to the farther destination first (??!?) and neither ticket had the apartment number printed on it. This is not the first time we've said we'll never do this again. But seriously, we won't."}
{"text":"Always fast and have never had an issue with my order. The Brooklyn style is especially good! One tip: always check online for coupon codes. Dominoes has a TON and you can almost always save a few bucks"}
{"text":"Luke warm review for a less than luke warm pizza and chicken delivery.  I wonder how hard it is to plan pizza delivery?  35 minutes from store to house is not real good planning.  To be fair this location has done pretty good in the past and that is why I am not totally upset.  However, if this happens again, I will write a follow up review that is less kind.  They are 90% accurate at this point, probably better than most?"}
{"text":"I do not recommend. About 11 years ago I ordered a pizza and it never came. We got a pace for a free pizza but they wouldn't except it. I know this was a long time ago but has been done cannot be forgiven"}
{"text":"Great service & great employees... The only place we LOVE to order pizza from... Customer service is top notch..."}
{"text":"The guy that answers the phone his name is Alexandre! He rude and annoying and have no respect to customers or to the place he works for. I have asked a simple question and all he replied back saying was \"really\" !!!!!!???!!!! It's definitely a bad experience that doesn't match with brand name. This message is for Dominos pizza management team please make sure you you monitor your staff!!! It is an embarrassment that you have people working like Alexandre."}
{"text":"Ordered a BBQ chicken pizza with NO onions online.  What did the pizza have on it?  Onions!  Even if it didn't have the onions on it, it wasn't a very good pizza especially for the price.  Better off going to Pizza Hut or P-Jays."}
{"text":"After leaving feedback on an order the manager quickly called me and offered a free pizza on my next order. It showed that they genuinely care about their customers. Just got my order and I'm pleasantly suprised at the quality and speed of service. Will definitely use this place again."}
{"text":"Domino's pizza has improved immensely over the years. And I have never had a bad experience at this location. The employees are always polite and friendly to me, their delivery employees are nice and get the pizza here quickly.   I've even gone in one occasion and ordered 15 pizzas at once for an event, did not have any problems. Great pizza, price is good (use the coupons online!!), and I love that they're so close by."}
{"text":"I would never order from this location again,  they are very slow. I have waited for more than an hour for my order to arrive...when I call the store the only reason they have is that they have run in to complications and is out for delivery now ..not sure why it takes 80 min to deliver in a 2 mile radius....bad service...stay away if want your food delivered on time...."}
{"text":"Okay I place an order at 12 online it literally took 3 hours plus the pizza never came to my house 3 hours waste of my time now I called and no one will pick up holding I will get my refund back bad customer service they didn't even call at all...."}
{"text":"I've just gotten too irritated with this place. Too many times they have messed up my order. Simple things. The drivers are generally pretty polite and punctual. Today my order was super simple. Pizza and wings, wings that had hardly any sauce and they gave me the wrong side of sauce. This is the third time that's happened with this place. How do you get a simple things like this wrong."}
{"text":"We called and ordered delivery, they accepted the order. 5 minutes later, we were called and they told us to \"walk\" to come get the delivery that we ordered.  So needless to say, we didn't get any pizza. How does this even happen?!"}
{"text":"They're always super fast with delivery and pizza is great. My only complaint is that the cheese can be hit or miss with how cooked/burnt it is."}
{"text":"I spoke with one of the employees for 14 minutes.   She had a really hard time taking my address.  Then the pizza was cold and tasted like balls and Jing weeds."}
{"text":"We've been ordering pizza from here for 20 years. The delivery or pick up is always on time and the pizza is very good! Thin crust is the best! Thank you, Domino's Quail Corners!"}
{"text":"Bad costumer service they don't double check the orders and keep forgetting to deliver a couple of items."}
{"text":"This is the worst pizza I've ever eaten. Hardly any sauce or cheese and no flavor whatsoever. Will definitely not order from here again."}
{"text":"today was the worst experience ever from dominos.we ordered 2 medium pizzas,bread bites,cinna sticks and a 2 liter and our food shows up to see that one of the pizzas dont have the main ingredient..yeah a pizza with no meat..so i called them back and they said i had to come to the store and pick it up or they refund me a pizza next time i order..I told the lady i used all my money to order and  we dont have transportation so i cant come pick it up..im very disappointed and im not sure if i will ever order from them again."}
{"text":"Great customer service. Delivery person came back with the changed requested. Honestly didn't need to do that. Will use again."}
{"text":"Went in the guy on the register was a MORON! Slow as fucking Christmas and clearly couldn't understand why I was saying as I specifically asked for thin crust got home and had regular crust pizza. VERY DISATISFIED! If you live in the area I recommend the location at valley view and Sahara, better service and smarter people."}
{"text":"I called this Dominos tonight and was treated so horribly by a female worker over the phone. She hung up on me the first time while I was still talking and the second call she took my address and proceeded to tell me I was too far away when it was only 3 miles away. She quickly told me another location and when I asked her if she could repeat herself she hung up on me again! I will never order pizza from somewhere where I'm treated so rudely!"}
{"text":"Great service. Love the online order APP"}
{"text":"Horrible service. Called at 11:30am. I live less than a mile away. I called after am hour and they said it was out for delivery. Nope! Then the guy calls me 20 minutes later bc he can't find the address. I told him to forget it. Not worth the bad pizza. And they obviously deliver but you cannot order online for delivery which I do not understand. I wish I could give them no stars. Like other reviewers stated, they were bad and I thought after a year I would give them another chance. So really I guess this is my mistake. Will not order from here ever again. Horrible."}
{"text":"The pizza here is amazing! People are friendly, and i would recommend the Cali chicken bacon ranch or the Hawaiian pizza"}
{"text":"I've asked them to bring change because I don't have a debit card and only a large bill. They told me their going to cancel our order instead of just bringing change. I've ran two separate corporate Dominos locations before and it's never been policy to turn people down just because you're scared of sending out a driver with a measly  $80 in change. I'm not happy at all. The person on the phone even treated me like I was a child.  Screw this Dominos."}
{"text":"The food is alright but delivery takes over an hour and I live 10 minutes away."}
{"text":"Our order is always fresh and perfect! Also if you love bread, try the Parmesan Bites."}
{"text":"Very displeased with this delivery dining experience. While staying at a nearby hotel, 6 miles from the dominos location, I grew an appetite for wings and pizza. I decided to call in a delivery order for said items. The gentleman who took my order by phone did not offer to discuss any of the offers or specials going on that would have given me a better deal, after asking I found that I got more food and saved $7 by taking advantage of a current promotional offer for pizza and wings. The gentleman on the phone stated that my order would take 30-45 minutes. The order ended up taking 1 hour, 37 minutes, more than double the estimated time. I was dissatisfied but still hungry. When I opened the box of wings it contained no \"drum style\" wings, only the smaller 2 bone wings with minimal meat. Wings were very soggy, not hot and seemed as if they may have been cooked much earlier and reheated. Pizza had the same appearance, as if it was cooked hours ago and sat in a car. Pizza box graphics offered encouraging messages such as \"look at that cheese\" however cheese was minimal and hard as if the pizza had significantly cooled down since being cooked. Overall very dissatisfied with this dominos experience. Will not be dining with this establishment again. Thank you."}
{"text":"Called in an order ahead of time for 2 pizzas w/ 2 toppings.  Guys/gals couldn't get it right and are making me late having to wait another 15 mins to remake a single pizza.  At the time I placed the order, I confirmed which toppings were to be on each pizza. They had repeated it back to me correctly and quickly hung up.  I dropped 1 star for this as I didn't even get an apology when they started making the re-do. They just asked if I wanted to take that pizza home with me. ??? WTH?  The place is clean and kept. Parking is a cinch just outside the doors. Employee did greet me upon arrival, but that was pretty much it except for me bringing it to their attention that my order was wrong.  After they provided me with my correct order, the guy who made the pizza came out from behind the counter and gave me a half assed apology. He tossed in the incorrect pizza along with my other 2."}
{"text":"Deliver hilariously late. Tracker said that the pizza had been delivered 45 minutes before I actually got it (waited for like 1.5 hours total). Don't order delivery from here."}
{"text":"Best dominos pizza location. They are absurdly fast and we always get exactly what we order. Their crust (garlic) has made me want to eat crust again! Their chicken is rubbery just like all chicken anymore...seriously look into better quality chicken (free range) and raise your price by $1. Other than that no complaints, just yum."}
{"text":"My favorite Dominos location! I've ordered several times, both delivery and carryout, and I've been pleased with every order.  I've carried out at different locations such as the one on Simmons and Lake Mead in North Las Vegas (don't go there.. they make their food so sloppily) and no one is as good as them.  My favorites there are the mango habanero wings, chicken alfredo bread bowl, lava cakes, (OMG yummmmmmy) and their hand tossed pizza with chicken and bacon.   I seriously eat there every week. I'm going to blow up, but I'll blow up satisfied haha!"}
{"text":"Good pizza, lousy scheduling for carryouts. What I was told would be 10 to 15 minutes turned out to be 40. Caveat emptor."}
{"text":"Horrible service. Employees cussing in front of me, laughing and making jokes with other co workers, ignoring customers. Talking about their personal issues rather than making my pizza. As I can see and hear them clearly. Forgot to put my pizzas in the oven, and made me wait 40 min when I called ahead. WOULD NOT RECOMMEND COMING TO THIS LOCATION!"}
{"text":"I have ordered from this location three times now.  The first time was ok.  The second time they messed up my order and offered me a $15 credit that I could use any time.  I called in to use my credit and was told I would have to call back five hours later when the general manager was in.  I asked for the manager and he got an attitude with me and hung up on me.  VERY Poor management!!!!  I've been in customer service most of my life and this was some of the worst I have ever received."}
{"text":"We order pizza here all the time. The staff is always friendly and polite. I have been to other dominoes locations but this one is the best! Get the pan pizza well done with xtra cheese and sauce and youll never order pizza any other way."}
{"text":"Took over two hours to deliver an ice cold pizza. No warning that on a week night it would take hours. My pizza was dry and not even the slightest bit warm.   For trash pizza, the only requirements are it shows in a reasonable amount of time and is warm. Somehow this location can't manage that. Won't be having Dominos again."}
{"text":"Not hot. Toppings not distributed evenly....like 80% sausage on one slice , 20% spread around to the other slices, same with pineapple. Tomatoe sauce tastes like a mix of chef boyardee and ketchup. Dough is like wonder bread. Chicken wings were great though.. That deserves two stars."}
{"text":"Love this Dominos there has been a few mistakes over the past 6 years but minor, absolutely the best pizza place. Most other pizza places are just so skimpy on ingredients but not them. Just placed another order and it was great ( loved it)."}
{"text":"I used to love this place . I was impressed at first.  Then they forgot my sauces that cost me 3.00 and didn't care. Then one time they knocked at my door didn't call me, and left. Then even when they got back to dominos nobody still didnt call or notify me. So an 2 hours later I got my pizza and it was cold and nasty. Today , I order pizza once again. I call because I forgot to give them instructions on when to call. Mary decided to tell me \"you need to hurry it on up! I've got food to catch\". Uhhhhh! excuse me? That is rude!!!! I've worked in the food industry and have for the past 5 years I understand how crazy busy things can get but I'm a customer calling you not only that paying you! Trying to help you guys out with finding my place, and this is how I'm treated??? My bad!!!!!!!  I will not return anymore!!!!!"}
{"text":"I love all the food but it takes like 24 hours to get the stumped food  so you can eat it."}
{"text":"Funny they didn't complete my order in the order tracker so I couldn't fill out satisfaction survey. Instead of trying to outsmart your customers train for better customer service."}
{"text":"We live right here in the same town and have only had minor setbacks with this restaurant. However, this evening we used a coupon for a free pizza from ordering a certain amount over time. We ordered an additional pizza in a coupon including garlic bread knots. Shortly after ordering, we received a phone call informing us that they no longer had the oil they use for the knots this evening. So we asked for a replacement and they offered dessert, which we made clear we didn't want. We asked if since we couldn't have the bread if they'd just discount the total... then they informed us that our total actually went up. After talking with the kind lady on the phone, she grabbed her manager. With him being totally unaware that she hadn't muted their end, he flew off the handle cussing about \"It's only such and such more. I've got it. YOU'VE got it. Who doesn't have it?!\" Throw in a few F bombs and then she quickly hit the mute button. Once she unmuted the line, we informed her we'd no longer like our order and to cancel it. We placed a call to the Dominos service line and got a detailed message to whomever it concerned.   Fair warning, if you have an issue with your order, don't expect kindness and understanding in its place."}
{"text":"My friend and I pulled into the shopping complex and decided to grab an iced tea at snoh, and then pickup a pizza at dominos.   We parked in front of dominos (customer parking) but as we walked by our car, 2 employees started yelling and screaming at us. They were telling us not to park in front of the dominos because we weren't \"customers\".   I told the female employee that we were going to grab a pizza to go, and she continued to yell at me like a psycho!   This was completely uncalled for.  A company should not have employees that scream at customers. I will never go back to this location."}
{"text":"Manager stayed open late just so that I could get something to eat. Employees were all reasonably kind and service was quick."}
{"text":"This location is great!  Each time I have gone there, the customer service has been great--very fast, competent, courteous.  The food has always been hot, fresh, and delicious.  Very pleased with my experience with them."}
{"text":"One hour 40 min for delivery. Called and they lied said it was out for delivery. It was not. Tracker said 22-32min for delivery. Pizza was stone cold."}
{"text":"This is chain pizza place...so you cant compare it to a traditional specialty pizza parlor..i.e. Mom and Pops place.  As a chain pizza place, the quality is pretty good. Really cant complain.  I've order pizza here many time... Melissa is usually the one making it. She does a fantastic job!  Service:Good Presentation:Good  Quality:Good (its a chain pizza place). Just like you cant compare Taco Bell to a authentic Mexican restaurant.   So far no issues. From order to pick up is usually about 15-20 minutes.  5/5 for a chain pizza parlor!!!"}
{"text":"The pizza and wings arrived after about an hour.  Watching their magic order tracker on the web site it appeared it sat on the counter for about 30 minutes before a driver took it out.  They arrived barely warm but not hot at all.  The dressing that was \"included\" with the wings was nowhere to be found.  Bad experience.  No clear method to complain without calling the local store directly."}
{"text":"Obviously the owner doesn't read these. We ordered from the one on McDowell instead(They're friendly at least :). I dare you to call this branch ask simple questions about the specials lol... You'll understand what I'm talking about... Nothing going on upstairs"}
{"text":"It's just a simple friday tonight and we just got back from a football game it's your casual let's go Cowboys. so you got a little hungry and thought hey it's Domino's who wouldn't want Dominos. Later on it was me who finally chose we should settle down with Domino's. So we order top QUALITY Pizza fat has double the amount of cheese double the amount of pineapple I know but pineapple does belong on pizza. Not only that but with the three pizzas we ordered we decided for a little dessert. now once we finish this order and mind you it was 11:00 at night we place this order for this delicious top QUALITY Pizza and waited patiently for it to arrive. An hour goes by and the pizza has not yet arrived. The wait time was said to be 35 to 45 minutes but we didn't let this get our hopes down so we decided to call. As we called of course there was a little bit of waiting required but this was only acceptable for such a busy place. As soon as we answered we established our names and proceeded to explain that we do not know where our pizza is. This was quickly followed by no reply and a speedy hang up. That's when we tried to call again and we were left on hold for a total of 15 minutes. The delivery boy finally calls and says that he's here. So we go out and pay for our pizza at 12:50 a.m. it is now Saturday we ordered this Friday just for it to come the next day. 4 out of 6 of us we're already asleep how were we supposed to eat and enjoy this delectable fine dining of QUALITY Pizza if 4 out of 6 of us are asleep. So we tips him for the meal on top of the pay after such a long wait almost 2 hours. We finally go inside set the pizza on the table and open all of its contents to see what are wait has bought us. We then opened the cinnamon bread twists and there was only 7 out of 8. 7 out of 8!?! Where did our last cinnamon bread twist disappear to? Chris the pear, Shaun the Apple, Marc the orange, and Minio the pepper vow that the 8th cinnamon bread twist will not disappear in vain and shall live on forever in our hearts and remind us that Domino's shall know our names for the Yelp reviews will always be coming. (The pizza was ok but that's not the point)"}
{"text":"Thus far, I haven't been disappointed with this dominoes. They always deliver exactly what I ordered and they always prepare the pizzas perfectly."}
{"text":"Yelp makes you add one star..  You can't give zero..  I have ordered from this location for 4 yrs..  It was ok service ..  Never complained because it is dominos the fast food of pizza ..  Tonight was ridiculous ..  Ordered online (as always)..  They called back with a question while I was out watering plants ..  I called right back to tell them they did not get the order correct.  Placed on hold 15 minutes...  Hung up ..  Doorbell rang with driver and incorrect pizza ..  Ok .. I get it I will wait for the correct pizza.. Called dominos back ..  They say no problem will send correct pizza at no charge...  Pizza delivery guy comes 40 minutes later..  We say thanks and start eating ..  Pizza guy comes back..   He says I need 16.99 ???  We say ummm no .....  they said no charge due to errors ..  Called manager \"Shelby\". She stated it was because we didn't pick up the phone originally when they thought the order was incorrect!! HELLO!!! We called right back and held for 15 min!!!  Tonight as a total we have been on the phone with dominos approximately 45 min to over an hour ..  All for a simple pizza..  Never again ..  No wonder this location had such a low rating ..  I have been too easy on them.. I am in the customer service industry and have never encountered this low of customer value..  In fact ..  Never wrote a yelp review before because I feel for the \"other side\" but tonight was the worst I have ever been treated..  Headed to a fast food joint to get something for dinner ..  Don't call this place ..  They could give. 2 sh***...and for the record .. I don't think \"Shelby\" is the manager ..  She sounded exactly like the girl I was on hold with on call two..  Just sayin :)"}
{"text":"Update: I know it's really late but only fair I let everyone know after leaving feedback on their website I was contacted by the store manager and offered two x large pizzas on the house to make up for this. They were made much better."}
{"text":"Let's me start me off by saying that they took way too long to make our pizza. 25 minutes for one pizza is pretty darn ridiculous! On top of that they didn't have stuffed crust available which they charged us for anyway and offered to give us a coke instead of a refund because it was \"too difficult\" to give refunds. The pizza they gave us was completely wrong! It had nothing but cheese and mushrooms on one side and the other side were the condiments that we ordered. I asked the man if he can fix it and he offered to remake it  which was nice but I was starving and was in a rush. I asked him to throw in some jalapeños and pepperonis on the naked side which he did, but gosh that was a huge mistake. He gave me loose crispy pepperoni chips flying around in the box and burnt toasty mushrooms. I'm not one to complain an I'm not trying to make Pizza Hut look bad, because I love Pizza Hut, but I'm just disappointed and had to write a review about this specific location so that they can step it up a notch. P.S. that place smelled like some bad plumbing."}
{"text":"Ordered once from this store before.. Took over an hour an a half.  The online tracker kept changing times of when it left the store.  Once the pizza finally came, it was luke warm and the driver said that they are short staffed.  We gave them the benefit of the doubt and ordered again.  Figured, maybe it was a one time thing.  Now, it's been an hour and 15 minutes since the order.  The online tracker said one thing while the store manager passively said they are \"super busy\" and the tracker is wrong.   This is now twice from the same store that it has taken more than an hour with no sense of apology.  Do not order."}
{"text":"The pizza is always delivered hot and fast. The online experience is easy. We like the alfredo pasta bread bowl and thin and crispy Hawaiian style pizza. Prices are good. We are very satisfied with dominos pizza on Marks st. In Henderson!"}
{"text":"Ordered for delivery last night at 11pm waited an hour, nothing showed up and no one called or picked up when i called back. called today in the morning to speak with the manager and he tells me didn't know what happened and that my order was still there today. Nothing was done by the restaurant to solve the issue other then \"i don't know what happened\" disgusting service for this restaurant and an embarrassment for Domino's."}
{"text":"I have really long dark hair. Found a short curly hair in my cheese bread. At noon on a Thursday. If you're looking for mediocre pizza & hairy bread, this is the place."}
{"text":"Ordered a pizza from Dominos they got the order  wrong. I ordered a 14\" create you own pizza and they sent a plain cheese 14\" cheese pizza.  I called them up and they willing to create a new order. Within 15min they had our order right. Than you."}
{"text":"Tonight my boyfriend and I ordered a large pepperoni, mushroom and sausage carryout for their large 3 topping pizza for 7.99 coupon and we also got some garlic bites with a side of marinara. We assumed it would take like 30 min so we showed after 30 min and had to wait an additional 15 min because it wasn't ready. Cool not that big a deal, until we found out the pizza was cold, they forgot our sauce and the bag holding our garlic bites was ripped so garlic crumbs/powder was all over. I went back into the store to get our sauce and literally 2 employees looked at me and said NOTHING. So I stood there for a good couple min and then one employee just put his finger up at me in like a \" 1 more min\" or \"hold on\" but still said nothing. So I finally said \"Hi, just need the my sauce you forgot\" then the gentleman with the finger called a co worker from the BACK OF THE STORE to come to the FRONT OF THE STORE just to ask me... I quote \"what's up?\" Then rolled her eyes. Btw domino's, pizza hut keeps their marinara sauce in a warmer cause it tastes BETTER than cold watery sauce. Sorry, but probably won't pick this location anymore"}
{"text":"Ordered last night when it got here all of it was cold and the dough was gooey waste of $20+."}
{"text":"I picked up a pizza on Friday 04/13/18 at around 8 pm and the staff was behaving very unprofessionally and seemed immature. Two of the males had long ponytails and did not have on hairnets. None of them wore gloves either but I am not sure if that is standard practice... One of them ran a pizza they were taking to the oven into the other guy. Then he just replaced the toppings and went to the oven. No one knows what could've been on his shirt, therefore I think the pizza should have been tossed and re-made. The entire crew was laughing and joking around while I was waiting for my pizza. I don't mind people talking or joking at their work place but it is not a party and workers are not there just to have fun. There should always be some level of professionalism and responsibility shown, ESPECIALLY when customers are there. I will not be ordering from this location again."}
{"text":"Jesus Christ Almighty... 2 hours to deliver a pizza somewhere 5 minutes away? Horrible service. I have a broken leg so I can't walk or drive there. Other wise I would because that's inexcusable."}
{"text":"constantly undercooked pizza unprofessional service and the chicken wings are like frozen tysons chicken from Walmart"}
{"text":"Current manager Hondo or Honda is a complete idiot and rude. Does not return customer phone calls / messages. This was regarding putting a large order. You think that he would care about his store's profit margin? Wrong! WTH is with this guy's attitude? I hope they can him ASAP. Anyways,, I just ordered from another store since Mr. Hondo is too good to respond to customer phone calls. Hopefully if enough people complain on here and also call corporate on him, he will eventually get fired."}
{"text":"Nick is a great store manager and gets the job done. He cares and goes beyond the call of duty to make sure the customer is served his pizzas and is satisfied. Thanks Nick for following through! You just got another loyal customer instead of my local Domino's store manager who has his head up his butt and won't return phone calls."}
{"text":"****UPDATE**** I did contact corporate. Shortly after I received a call AND text msg from the district manager. He was fantastic. We had a very upbeat fun conversation. He not only apologized and thanked me, but he made it right. And asked if it was ok to use this experience as a training tool. He is also in charge of training for his district. I did take him up on his offer and accepted the free pizzas. I did not tell them that they were freebies due to a bad situation, and they were made perfectly! I even sent a picture to show him they did a great job!    Our pizza was missing toppings. And the toppings they did put on were so few and far between it looked pathetic. One piece of pepperoni, one mushroom and one banana pepper per slice. It was bad. Said they weigh the toppings for each pizza per how many toppings you have...wtf us that all about??? I called the manager, Ryan and he never offered an apology or offered to make it right, as per the toppings they forgot. Only continually said that's how corporate wants it done. I will be contacting corporate and will not be ordering from dominos again. After all we did pay for the toppings we did not get."}
{"text":"If there was a way to give ZERO stars I would.  Ordered from here twice.  The first time the driver took over 1 hour and 30 mins on a late nite delivery when I live 8 minutes away.  NO CALL what so ever! I took that as to never order from them again.    My roommate ordered from there tonight and HE had to call after 2 hours of no food or phone call.  The online order even said it was delivered!  As he called they apologized and said they've been 'backed up'...on a Tuesday....we could have walked to the closest grocery store, bought the raw ingredients, stopped for a beer, came back, preheated the oven and made our own before this Dominos was delivered.   After the apology (with no offer for a discount) they told my roommate the driver should be there soon.  He wasn't..my roommate then took another 20 mins deciding where else he should order, placed it and then called back to cancel the Dominos order.  EXTREMELY rude and careless and not only that tried to blame my roommate that he did not answer his phone when \"they called twice and were outside\"...we have a big window in the front of our house..no car was ever there.    I don't understand how they keep this business running.  Save your frustration and go with one of the local pizza shops.  Plus way better quality food."}
{"text":"2nd worst pizza place in the area.  They messed up the order and tried to tell us we made the order on the phone.  They had me waiting and arguing with a baby and other young child in tow and would not accommodate is in any way. I think \"mushroom\" sounds a lot different than \"sausage\"!  First time ordering from them since being in the Pittsburgh area, and now the last.  Way to go Dominos, please have corporate teach customer service to the locations."}
{"text":"On hold for 20 min, called back 3 time on hold for 6 min each time. Called back on time asking for a supervisor, and then placed deliberately on hold without finishing my sentence  The employees attitude changed, I hung up and contacted corporate. By e-mail of course, there wasn't a phone number to call on the website  Calling papa Johns I guess"}
{"text":"Big mistake. I had a lapse in judgement. I never eat here but I'm sick with the flu and had a coupon. They sent me the wrong order and when I called they hung up on me.   I didn't think I could feel worse while being this sick but this food made me forget my illness as I could only focus on how bad it was. Had one slice because I'm literally dieing from this flu and couldn't eat any more.   This is the most intense grease bomb I have ever seen. Each slice is dripping in oil. The entire box is soaked through. I probably would have felt better eating the box. The crust isn't bread but grease held together by just enough flour to keep it solid.   To all of you who order Dominos once a year and are on yelp to consider it because of a good deal or the late night delivery, DON'T DO IT. You will feel so much shame and regret and will swear off dominos until the same time next year when your memory of this horrible day has faded."}
{"text":"We were completely satisfied. Easy order and quick delivery. We love there oven bake sandwiches."}

{"text":"ONE STAR IS INCREDIBLY GENEROUS. PLEASE DON'T ORDER HERE. I was in Charlotte on business, and placed an order with a woman this Domino's at about 5pm. She said it would be about 30-45 minutes. When 6:50 came around and my order was still nowhere in sight, I called this location, and was told that this location wouldn't have taken my order, it would have been the one on S. Tryon Street (mind you, this Dominoes is 2.9 miles away from my hotel, versus the one they're telling me would have taken my order, which is 2.9 miles away). So, an employee puts me on hold and tells me he's calling the other location to verify that they have my order. Confirms they have my order, gives me their number. I call them, and they tell me they have no record of this order ever being placed, and tell me I'm lying and that I never talked to anybody because a woman doesn't work there supposedly. Aggravated, I call the other location AGAIN. The manager tells me the delivery driver made it to the hotel, but she has to wait for him to come back to see what happened and why I didn't receive my order. Puts me on hold. Gets back on the phone and tells me that \"unfortunately this location doesn't deliver\" and if i want the pizza I now ordered over TWO HOURS AGO, I have to call and place it with the other location. Both locations are absolutely awful. I hope they both close. Dominoes HQ got my complaint and never even followed up. Please don't let this shitty company waste your time."}
{"text":"This place is just as bad as the one on South Blvd. PLEASE don't bother wasting your time. Rude, uncooperative, and just plain lazy. Basically called me a liar. The other location told me that this one had my order for whatever reason, and when I called to ask because the employee at the other location told me he \"confirmed\" that my order was here, and when I told this location about it, they were arguing with me, telling me I never placed an order nor ever spoke to anyone about it. Guess what? Your pizza isn't special anyways, don't flatter yourselves. I'd sooner eat a bunch of three decade old rotten bananas before I'd order here again. Don't waste your time."}

{"text":"Ok so its Dominos; so you know what to expect. But this Dominos has great pizza, especially since they've improved the recipe.  If you haven't tried it, you should!  Service is always fast and efficient.  I order from here when I want pizza late at nite and when North End is closed.  Also, in case you didn't know, you can order online and they always have coupons!"}
{"text":"Half the time they get the order right half the time my pizza is burnt and inedible. I love the gluten free cheese pizza with mango habanero wings the wings are often under cooked."}
{"text":"We didn't order from this Domino's.   Southwest Airlines ordered for us and about 100+ other passengers that were stuck at the Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport for about 5-6 hours.  I believe they ordered 75-80 pizzas and it did turn out to be enough to feed all of us.     When the Domino's people showed up, some were ready to hug them, cause they were hungry.  And I will admit I was one of them.   We had so much weight in carry on luggage that trying to go get food was difficult, so what was offered free by Southwest was welcome.     I believe they sent 4 employees and used an airport cart to bring all the pizzas in.  The pizzas were not very hot, just lukewarm and that's no surprise as I don't think their ovens can rotate over 20 large pizzas at a time and we as a group had at least 3 or 4 times that many.   The pizza also had that signature cardboard smell and taste of the dominos boxes, but at the time it was so damn good.      They didn't bring enough cheese packets and no red pepper, but there were enough napkins, people were very civil in line and we had enough to eat for hours.   It was even still acceptable after it was cold as room temp.   And anyone that has ever been in college knows that room temp pizza is just fine.   ;)"}
{"text":"This is the most horrible is dominoes I've ever ordered at if you call the check on order more than one time they put you on hold and just leave you there without even saying hello the people that answer the phone act all nice and them in the driver work together just to have fun for the day horrible"}
{"text":"Manager extremely rude. Messed up my order and gave me a pizza with nothing but sauce and the crust... No cheese, no toppings... When I called back the manager told me that's what I had ordered and it was my fault. Never in my life have I encountered a manager like that. HOW THE HECK DID THIS GUY GET PROMOTED?"}
{"text":"These guys are always busting their butts... It's a really busy location and they always do a great job."}
{"text":"Okay. This should probably be about the food (which by the way, was great!). But it's not. I hardly write reviews. I think I have written maybe 3 at the most? It's either because I want people to steer clear from this establishment, or because it was absolutely amazing. As you can see, this is a \"5 star\" review. I was having a gosh awful day today, ordered a pizza, & jokingly put \"happy faces for a bad day!\" On the delivery instructions. The amazing, sweet, big hearted delivery lady made me little flowers from napkins, made happy faces on my box, and wrote encouraging phrases. My day was absolutely completely turned around. I hope you guys at domino's read the reviews, and I just want to continue to say THANK YOU to the lovely lady who made my day incredible."}
{"text":"They usually have good deals like large with 4 toppings for 11.99 and the staff are generally friendly"}
{"text":"Every time we order from here, it's wrong, no matter how many times the order is repeated. They're usually able to fix the mistake, which is the only reason why I'm giving two stars. The frustration here just isn't worth it. Don't bother picking up yourself either because the parking spaces are all taken by delivery vehicles."}

I thought well that's a little much but what ever I just want to be done with this and go home . He said the wait is 10 to 15 minuets. 20 minutes later a young girl asked me what my name is ? I tell her my name and she said we can't find your order ??? Lol I said what? The kid standing next to you took my order ... she said yeah we can't find it what would you like we can reorder and the wait will be Another 15 minutes and I'll throw something in for free. I said how about you pick what you want to give me for free because at this point I'm no longer hungry . I asked for my receipt because I later head a guy say he paid 7.99 for a large pizza ? The girl at the register couldn't find it ... I pulled up my bank app on my phone and showed her how much I was charged and let her know I wasn't given anything for free!!! She had a long line and I was embarrassed for her so I left it at that !! But it still needs to be known . Not cool man ."}
{"text":"They have a little dining room without napkins (they are out), they are out of the parmesan cheese, they are out of crush pepper.  No plates to \"eat\" there.   Shame on this location."}
{"text":"Customer service, not so great when busy,  of course I called when busy. Once I arrived, it was explained to me that the attention on busy nights is given to the pizza making, its best to come in.....The hand tossed pizza is blazing! Hats off to the crew for pizza making skills"}
{"text":"Just waited 90+ minutes to be delivered cold pizza. No apologies from the driver, not even a call.  Needless to say I won't be ordering from this establishment in the future."}
{"text":"Ordered 2 medium pizzas, each with 2 toppings. One was crispy thin crust - it was burnt to a crisp and missing one of the toppings. The other one was terrible, but appropriately cooked. Apparently, when you get cheese toppings, they give you like 3 extra pieces of cheese. A total disgusting rip off. Never mind that the driver couldn't manage to buzz the right apartment number (even though the buzz code was on the pizza box). I couldn't pay online, but could pay with credit card at the door. The machine wasn't working and needed to be restarted before it would accept my credit card. Overall, a total disaster."}
{"text":"I phoned ahead for my order and it was a busy, busy Saturday night for the workers. They told me only 15 minutes for 2 supremes. Wow. I got there in 15 minutes, and they were ready for me! Wow! Fresh. Hot. Delicious pizza. Courteous attentive staff. The delivery staff coming and going showed passion for their jobs in making sure the pizzas got out to the customers as efficiently as possible. I wish all Dominos were like this one."}
{"text":"I have never been a fan of Domino's Pizza. This is the only location that has ever made me feel differently about that. After I was told that I need to try this location I reluctantly did so. I have to say I'm really glad I did.  I cant speak for every style pizza here but I will say we only order the deep dish well done with pepperoni and black olives and its so good."}
{"text":"Short and sweet...Received the pizza I ordered correctly, fast and friendly. just a tip, if you want crushed red peppers or Parmesan cheese, you must place it as part of your order. Pizza was hot and great..."}
{"text":"I ordered a pizza online and after over an hour of waiting I call and they tell me the order was voided out because they decided to close early. By then it's already 10:45pm and too late to order anywhere else. Thanks Dominos"}
{"text":"I have never really had a problem with Domino's in the past like so many other people, but after my wife had to go gluten-free I really did not order very much pizza at all.  Thanks to their new, delicious gluten-free pizza, I now order from Domino's about once a week.  The gluten-free pizza is actually good enough that I would eat it, and I don't usually like gluten-free stuff at all.  Thanks Domino's for making a great tasting gluten-free pizza that my wife can eat so that I can order pizza again and not feel bad for eating it in front of her and rubbing it in that she can't have any."}
{"text":"Try the Habanero Wings. They are great! Quick service. Great computer system to follow order."}
{"text":"Pizza is good for a chain. They have gluten-free options. The prices are good. It's quick and convenient. I will likely go there again."}
{"text":"I called in a delivery over an hour and a half ago and didn't receive it. I called and asked to talk to the manager, after 7 mins of being on hold the manager didn't care and didn't offer to fix the situation at all. Adam then told me I could either cancer the order or wAit another 35 mins for a delivery. Terrible customer service"}
{"text":"I spoke too soon we got a pizza tonight and it had almost no cheese or sauce pretty disgusting. lately the quality of the pizzas has been great. I feel like as long as they make my pizza the way they would make there own pizza I will always be satisfied"}
{"text":"Great service. Very friendly.  Very.   Good quality products and always willing to help with any issues.   One of dominos best locations for sure."}
{"text":"This is just a pickup/delivery location. Its very small and there is literally no space for dining (just ordering). Its always super staffed and more times than not my pizza will be ready in under 20 minutes (delivery and pickup). No complaints. Quality consistency and affordable. My go to pizza place!"}
{"text":"Always great for a quick fix. Service is good and the delivery is usually on time and they are typically very nice. I've been ordering from them for a good 2 years now."}
{"text":"I will never be ordering from this location as long as Juan (if that is his name) is a 'supervisor.'  On Wednesday, I ordered pizza for lunch for myself and a coworker. When I ordered, the website said the pizza should be delivered in 19-29 minutes. Well, 55 minutes later, I made a phone call and spoke with a less than pleasant woman named 'Sue'. \"We got busy, so we just sent it out. Can't help that we are busy.\" Was her answer to me. Umm, I apologize that my 30 minute lunch break while my students are eating their lunch is too short of a window for you. Granted, I ordered the pizza 30 minutes before my break started. Thank you for ruining my break Sue.  Sue was of no help and did not seem to care that the pizza was close to an hour late. The delivery man (who we see all the time-my school USED TO do a lot of business here.) walked in as slow as a snail and didn't seem to care that he was unbelievable late. I crossed out the TIP and TOTAL and wrote on the receipt that I would be requesting a refund. Well, no apology and no receipt was left for me. Thanks stellar delivery man.  The next evening I called and asked to speak to a supervisor. This is where your company lost all respect and all business.  Juan is the 'supervisor' on duty. Your company should look into the qualifications. I have never spoken to such a punk mouth immature adult in my life.   \"Why didn't you call yesterday if this was your problem yesterday?\" Yes, that was the first question from him. I explained that I needed a minute to tell the situation and asked him to stop interrupting me, where he again interrupted and said \"I'm trying to help you and I'm busy, so don't tell me I'm interrupting.\" WELL THEN.  He then goes to the back room to try and edit my order. He tells me he can't edit it. \"Juan, what can we do to fix this problem?\" His answer...priceless... \"If you stop interrupting me I would tell you. I will ask my supervisor. I should be in tomorrow between 5 & 6, so I will call you then.\"  \"No Juan, sorry, but waiting 24 hours for you to call me back isn't an option. I will get in touch with your corporate.\" He clearly didn't like this answer...  \"Listen, we are busy, so this will have to wait.\" At this point, I'm blown away.  I ended the phone call. Yes, I hung up on your punk nasty supervisor. Your company should be ashamed of itself.  5 minutes later, I receive this voicemail... \"Um....this is Juan....just trying to get you your refund...give me a call...click\" Wow. Are your customers now your friends where you can leave unprofessional and weird messages? And yes, I have this voicemail saved and would love to send you a playback.  I call back to speak to Juan. At this point, he refuses to talk to me. He hands the phone to another employee (a bubbly female) who was the kindest thing ever and she processes a refund.  This review is going on every social media account possible. Oh, and word of mouth is priceless at an elementary school. We now have even more reason to have other great pizza places our business for countless pizza parties and events at school. Two points for you, Juan."}
{"text":"Usually we are huge fans of Domino's, but this particular location always messes up our order. We had three back to back to back wrong orders. I was just waiting for 40 minutes for one pizza! I couldn't believe it. At least this time they got our order right. How hard is it to greet a customer and make a pizza. I used to work at a Pizza Hut and I remember always having a manager on my back making sure we were following the proper procedures. This store does the absolute opposite. The employees are texting, they are goofing off and they don't know what customer service is at all. Whomever the franchisee is, or whomever the manager is, really needs to pop in for a surprise visit once in a while. Not during daytime hours, try dinner hours! I would like to be able to get a descent Domino's pizza once in a while."}
{"text":"This place can never answer there phone idk how there still in business I had to call at least 3/4 different times in order for them to answer that's total bull shit this place needs to get there shit together also while I sat there phone rang like crazy and apparently no one seems to hear it yet there all yapping in the back about stupid shit"}
{"text":"Absolutely awesome.  The order was accurate and HOT.  They didn't skimp on the toppings like all too many others.  Hands down, I am impressed at how Domino's is represented by this location."}
{"text":"Don't waste your money. I rather buy from Papa John's or Pizza Hut for sure. They have never messed up an order on me. We ordered a thin crust pizza, with two sides of garlic dipping sauce. The garlic dipping sauce cost us a dollar extra. First of all, the pizza was burnt. Secondly, we didn't even get our garlic dipping sauce that we paid a dollar extra for. This is the third time I've been here and they have always disappointed me. If you want Domino's, it's best to go to another location or any other pizza place."}
{"text":"I'm flight crew and I didn't get in until late at night, when literally everything was closed, even the hotel restaurant. So I decided delivery. After I ordered, It took over an hour and a half for this to be delivered to me. I called the store multiple time from 1AM-1:30AM only to have the phone picked up and immediately hung up, like they didn't want to hear anything from a customer.no hello or anything. Just immediately hung up.  When I recived the pizza and chicken wings, they were as cold as the coke I ordered with them. Also, I didn't even receive a receipt. My company paid for this, now I'm going to have to go through a whole mess just to get one. Ridiculous. Wouldn't recommend this to anyone, I definitely won't be coming back. I hope this review steers people clear of this place. I'll be contacting the store manager and corporate customer service. Horrible experience. I want my money back."}
{"text":"Absolutely disappointed! I just don't understand why we are given an estimated time of 20-30 minutes for deliveries but they take over an hour to deliver! I kept checking the tracker that they have and it said it was having a \"quality check\" and it was like that for over 30 minutes! If they messed up my order fine, but they could have called and informed me, as the customer, that they might take a little longer."}
{"text":"Domino's has made an amazing come back from when I was a kid.  I no longer have to avoid the noid.  Their pizza is a great, their crust is tasty, sandwiches are good, and are delivered exactly (or a little earlier) than their pizza tracker tells you it will be delivered.  It has always been on time for the several dozen orders in the past year.  The choose 2 for 5.99ea deal works well with both myself and my wife as we have drastically different tastes."}
{"text":"Nice and easy to order food from the dominos app, however it takes a long ass time for the food to be delivered. Wouldn't recommend wings with the bone in because the skin is not crispy and literally makes you feel like you're eating chicken flesh. Overall, it's a decent experience but we only ever order dominos late at night when nothing else is open."}
{"text":"They didn't even cut my pizza..... Awful customer service as soon as I walked in the door."}
{"text":"This place is dope. Ordered a pizza for pickup, and got there a little early, but had a great chat with the staff and they gave me a coupon for having me wait for my pizza. 10/10."}
{"text":"Their new Pizza formula:  Pros: Well, it was an improvement.  Cons: Salty crust. The sauce is way too sweet. The box still might have tasted better.  Well, it was worth a try."}
{"text":"We were also in a lazy mood and ordered in... The pizza came more quickly than we had anticipated! Which was good because we were hungry... About 3 bites in a found a long dark hair in my pizza... My wife trying to make me feel better assured me that it was probably hers. We both knew it wasn't. We started feeling much less hungry and as my wife went to throw the rest of the pizza away she found a big, black, nasty fly baked right in... Yum!   Maybe they were just having a bad day... But regardless we won't be ordering from them again... My wife makes better homemade pizza anyways..."}
{"text":"Ok Dominos you have come a long way!!!   I am SO happy that you have gourmet and gluten free pizza.  I was scared to try it as most gluten free pizzas are not that great.. I ordered the 5 cheese Wisconsin on a gluten free crust and it was awesome.  You make feeding two boys easy.  Thank you..   Oh and I love your online ordering and I signed up and you can see who makes your pizza and what process in creation it is very cool.   Nice job for a chain..."}
{"text":"Everything I ordered was ok, delivery was on time, driver was polite, but he stunk like cigarettes, my food packaging stunk like cigarettes, I had to let it sit out and air out so I couldn't smell cigarettes before I could eat it!"}
{"text":"I'm very upset with the service I received from this dominos. I completely understand that this is a chain, and the food is what it is. That said, I ordered 2 pizzas and chicken for pickup. I pick my food up, get home and open up my order and one of my pizzas have the incorrect toppings. I call the store and I ask to have the right pizza delivered, and I've been waiting for an hour and 15 minutes for my pizza. They want the old one back, so I've been waiting for an hour and 45 minutes. I called the store again to ask if they left and they said \"yea, I don't know when tho.\" Probably won't get pizza from there again"}
{"text":"I've been ordering from Dominoes for years. We have a game night most Saturdays and Dominoes is our go to pizza choice. Last night was no exception. I placed the order early and scheduled a delivery time. The time came and no pizza. 10 minutes passes, 20, 30, 40 and finally a pizza arrives - one pizza, not the 5 pizzas I ordered. Clearly some one else's order.  I explain to the driver, I call the store, I'm reassured that I'm at the top of the queue, I'm told I will be compensated with a coupon for money off next order. The correct order eventually arrives.. two hours late and as the picture shows, less than satisfactory. No compensation, no receipt that I signed, yet my bank account shows the full charge for the order.  ***** UPDATE ***** Owner of the store called me personally to apologize and offer rather nice compensation, in addition to saying he would talk to the driver and make sure they understood how to handle the issues like the receipt etc, moving forward."}
{"text":"Best Dominos on the planet fast and friendly. They take pride in making their orders. The price is unbelievable."}
{"text":"This was my first time here.  I pretty sure that there was at least 10+ people working there, but why didn't they see me standing at the counter for couple minutes?   I looked around to see if someone would take my order.  I ended up going to other pizza restaurant .   So I can't tell you about how good ( or bad) their pizzas is."}
{"text":"My \"go to\" spot for corporate pizza. Friendly staff and orders always done right and fast. I only do pick up; so, I can't comment on their delivery service. Love the app, too! So quick and easy! Love it here."}
{"text":"Ordered here the other day for lunch and it was great. I was just really disappointed in one thing which is they don't have deep dish in large sizes only medium. Other than that food was quality of your in the mood for pizza"}
{"text":"This Dominos is a great location close to home and a quick stop on the way from work. Call ahead is always easy. I usually order while there cause it really does not take them long. All the staff have been great and entertaining while waiting for our orders. Very friendly, and great customer service at this location."}
{"text":"I kindly told the guy at the register there was a dead fly on the counter (this happened on 3/6/2015 at around 3:45pm)  so what does he do grabs the fly with his bare hands and tosses it in the garbage!!  So gross I hope he washed his hands.. Those nasty little bugs contain maggots.. yuck. I will not be buying from domino's again."}
{"text":"Giving two stars for the speed pizza was delivered. Ordered one large thin crisp pizza with \"premium\" chicken, spinach & tomato along with one soda. Driver arrived without soda (we're all out (or did he just forget??)) but the pizza has maybe 5 chunks of chicken which all but two were completely pieces of fat (what they ran out of chicken too)?  Big yuck - tossing."}
{"text":"Just picked my order up. The people were super polite ND it looks like every thing I ordered came put perfectly. I can't wait to get home and dig in"}
{"text":"We order from this Domino's frequently - maybe once or twice a month.  Drivers are friendly, orders are quick and hot.  Reasonable price and decent food.  I use online ordering and love the pizza tracker - helps me be ready outside for the delivery so my dogs don't go insane at the doorbell."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery today for my fam bams, and was pleased with how fast the delivery was.   Their new cheesy jalapeño breadsticks is on point!!  Price was reasonable. Food taste great. And fast deliveries. This deserves a 5 star."}
{"text":"Good sandwiches and fat delivery.  Their wings are not great and the boneless wings MUST have sauce to have flavor but that is a corporate issue and not the site. Drivers have always been nice"}
{"text":"Horrible !  I spent 1 hour waiting on my pizza coming from the store that was down the street. Est delivery was 30 to 45 min .Pizza  wasn't hot. And 4 toppings were missing!!! I basically had a veggie pizza.  They left out all the meats! I was charged 26 dollars for a medium 2 topping PIZZA! I shoudnt have left a tip online . I do not recommend this location at all."}
{"text":"Ordered diet coke, got coke.  Driver told me they didn't have diet coke.  When I said, why did I leave my number, he said sorry.  Pizza was decent"}
{"text":"Ordered pizza on Halloween day and THREE HOURS later nothing.... I called the store and they said they were having issues with the online orders? I talked to a manager and got a refund with no apology at all.  My son wanted the brownie cookies so I gave them another try and ordered again.... TWO HOURS later NOTHING. I called the store 10 times and no one picked up! When they finally picked up I told them I need my order refunded! NEVER will I order from them again. I never got an apology and I asked what the issue has been at that store and the employee said it was because of the special promotion going on online? Seriously?!??!!?? This is ridiculous. I'm never ordering from them again and will be reporting this issue to corporate because obviously something isn't working over there."}
{"text":"Thin crust here is really good. Quick service and friendly staff! Pizza in 10 mins to go, works for me !"}
{"text":"Horrible. Save your money or order from somewhere else. Used to be decent food, but recently I encountered HORRIBLE customer service and the last 3 times we've ordered here, our pizza was UNDERCOOKED. I ordered a chicken parm today (my mistake) and there was NO SAUCE. Would NOT RECOMMEND. Thumbs DOWN."}
{"text":"After a long and hard search and eating MANY LOUSY pizza's... FINALLY SUCCESS! Which is odd for us because where we moved to Las Vegas from Domino's had low scale pizza... I was kind of leery about ordering delivery pizza again after MANY FAILED pizza's from other places... But it was HOT!! FRESH!!! VERY YUMMY!! The driver was Very Friendly and even gave us great tips of what else to do here in Vegas besides the strip! I will DEFINITELY order from here again!  We were SO pleased to finally  cure the pizza cravings!! THANK YOU!!!"}
{"text":"NEVER ORDERING FROM HERE AGAIN!!!!  Ordered online a couple weeks ago, and my order was cancelled. Spoke to the manager on that shift and she is a real piece of work. Very rude. No customer service skills. Didn't give me a definite answer as to why they called and cancelled my order. Then they said i will get refunded my $3 charge and that never came back. Horrible horrible experience!"}
{"text":"Ordered online.  I received the pizza and it was sloppy way to much sauce really mushy. I order chicken wings being the wings half of them where under cooked.  I can't have my kids eating this.  Just disgusting horrible experience Never again"}
{"text":"They promised to deliver within 33 minutes and an hour after placing the order I had to call for status. They couldn't even courtesy call to advise they were going to take longer. On top of that, I placed a pretty big order and it was 1 of 3 sent out for the delivery driver. If I hadn't called back to cancel my order the food would have arrived cold."}
{"text":"Amazing pizza. This location is the only place I got pizza from now. If you haven't had Domino's in a while and you're looking for some good pizza, these guys can impress your taste buds :-)"}
{"text":"You get what you pay for at Domino's. Its cheap pizza at its finest. Or lowest. Since they \"changed\" their pizza from the \"crust up\", the pizza is at least edible now. I've always said the key to good pizza is the crust. A pizza with bad crust is no pizza at all, its just a messy pile of cheese and toppings you pick off of. The crust is alright now. The most noticeable change is they pour a bunch of butter and garlic on the outter crust which makes your hands all messy every time you eat it. Oh well.  This location sells dollar slices of cheese pizza during lunch time. They don't charge you tax, which is, I think, illegal. Oh well.  They seem to have this continually running special where you get a large one-topping pizza for $5.99. Their large is really a medium...its a 14\" pie. Oh well.  Two things of note:  Their bathroom is for customers only. And the only way to get into the bathroom is by asking the gal at the counter for the key. Its attached to a big pizza sauce ladle. I can only hope this is not used in the pizza-making. But just thinking about people touching this after they pee and touch their dingusses. Since you have to drag the ladle back to the counter, even if you wash your hands, they're still covered in imaginary pee-cooties. I know I'm not the only person who has thought of this. I didn't even wash my hands because I know it would be futile. Oh well.  The other oddity is during the lunch hours, they have this ultra-right wing neo-conservative nutbag Christian talk radio on. This dumbfounds me because all of the people working there are South Asian except maybe a driver now and then. Oh well.  The pizza is edible. Its cheap. You get what you pay for. Stop there during lunch if you like listening to anti-gay hatespeech and random comments about the President being born in a foreign country."}
{"text":"I am busy all week when I finally get to come home. And I don't feel like cooking,I can get on line and within a hour my pizza is here. Just the way I like it thin and crispy. I was eating at there competition. But now with the new dominoes this is my only go to"}
{"text":"I was really craving pizza...with jalapeño and green pepper topping. I ordered delivery they said give us 30 minuets they were at my door in 20. They have a lot of deals so don't forget to ask! The pizza was hot and fresh!"}
{"text":"Okay... I ordered through you guys tonight for the Tracker status because it's amazeballs. I'd say about 80% of the reason I ordered Domino's instead of Papa Johns was for the Tracker AND IT DIDN\"T WORK! Also the dang slider/shopping cart/checkout thing kept moving when I scrolled up but moved too much, I couldn't see what I wanted, ugh  Also the wings I ordered are pathetic looking, never again, smallest wings I've ever seen... hopefully they taste better than they look. Pizza looks about the norm which is good, thank you for that."}
{"text":"We order from this Domino's frequently. We have NEVER had an order messed up or not of good quality. We've picked up orders here and the place is very clean and the staff are very friendly. When delivered, our orders are always on time. It's so easy to place an order over the phone, online or through text. All we do now is text a pizza emoji. It can't get any easier!"}
{"text":"My order came (delivered) fast! I just finished eating a (triple) peperoni pan pizza with a caesar salad and it was as good as it gets!!! Great job guys at the Dominos on Pinnacle Peak Rd, Glendale, AZ."}
{"text":"Been ordering from this location for the past year or so. Today was the first time I ordering the pan pizza. Gotta say, I loved it! the only disappointing part was the chicken and red bell pepper pizza that I ordered. There was very little toppings on this, whereas the other pizza I ordered, a pepperoni and mushroom pizza, had just the right amount of toppings. Like I said, the chicken/bell pepper pizza was a complete disappointment. But because the staff her is always friendly and they have yet to mess up my order, I won't be knocking them a star...this time."}
{"text":"Stay away from this location!!  Ordered a large pizza and breadsticks for delivery. After waiting 45mins I noticed that the pizza was COLD. Called up the store and they informed me that it takes on average 40-50 mins for delivery even though I live down the street from the store. This is the second time I received a cold pizza from this location, and the last time I order dominos again."}
{"text":"This location is terrible. My husband and I  ordered a pizza and stuffed cheesy bread with 2 sides of marinara sauce for delivery, when it arrived I opened the box and there was a huge whole in the middle of the pizza. When the delivery driver called to tell his manager Candice about it she said \" I don't give a fuck, I aint remaking shit. Tell that mother fucker next time don't place an order 15 minutes before we close\". She was on speaker phone. Will never order here again."}
{"text":"Ive placed over 30 orders at this location, pizzas are always good. They are understaffed and do get overwhelmed which increases the delivery times. The new management has helped with customer service. I was talking with one of the employees and he said that there are a lot of apartments that don't deliver to because they are unsafe and have been robbed."}
{"text":"Consistently good service and haven't messed up a single order in the past year. pizzas are never burnt, cheese and toppings are in their proper places, people are helpful when you ask questions. Do be sure to use the coupons online rather than walk in and order as you cannot get the same deals."}
{"text":"The store at 8508 Sahara Ave. has botched our last two online orders.  For wing lovers, go elsewhere.  We have never seen smaller wings in our life! The food is tasty when prepared correctly, but this particular store seems to have a problem with order fulfillment. Check your order before accepting it. Mistakes made two times in a row suggest something may be amiss at that location."}
{"text":"Got a thin crust pizza yesterday, Absolutely the worst pizza I have ever eaten, NO DOUBT! Crust was worse than cardboard, sauce was sweet like a jolly rancher! Girl on phone even had a attitude when I ordered. Never again!!!!!!!!! Dominoes sucks"}
{"text":"Domino's Pizza is nothing special, but it is not bad either. People seem to still consider this inexpensive pizza though, but it is far from that. I don't mind eating their pizza, but I wouldn't recommend it as being a good deal. There are several places that you can find better tasting pizza at for the same price."}
{"text":"I ordered a pizza at 9:45 and it got to my house at 10:30, but that's not why I'm upset. Our pizza was great, our cheesy bread was burnt. But mainly, we tipped our driver $3 and went to get an additional $4 for him. When we walked back over with the money and handed it to him, he said \"I hope you know Jesus walks on water, and you don't.\" He then grabbed the money and walked off. I don't know what point he was getting across but it definitely offended the guests in my house. I then called to let the manager know, and she did not seem to have a care in the world about what her employee had done either. I'm extremely bothered by the way this matter was handled!"}
{"text":"Customer service at this Domino's is truly dead and I hope this store closes so I can order from another one and have them deliver. I was promised a $25.00 credit due to a messed up order. When I called to redeem, I was told there was no record of it. I called back and asked to speak to the manager and was placed on hold for over 10 minutes. I hung up and called back, asking for the name of the district manager. Zac, who was rude, told me I could call 1-800-Dominos. I asked to speak to the manager again without being on hold for another 10 minutes and was then placed on hold until I finally hung up.  If you have a choice, do not use this location. I have already filed a BBB complaint and sent an email to the corporate office so we will see how they respond."}
{"text":"This place is terrible with deliveries. If this is the closest pizza place then I would suggest you don't go here or order carry out and pick it up yourself. The last 2 times they have been between 60-75 minutes to deliver. They also don't have the audacity to make it up. Carry out - don't do delivery!!!"}
{"text":"Just had a pizza delivered. Half of it was burned. Not great (or any) quality control. It is 7pm and we are all hungry so we are just going to eat around the crappily-cooked parts, but we will be looking for a new pizza delivery place."}
{"text":"Order twice a week at the minimum. And they always do good. Even if busy and deliver cold pizza, they always make it up with free pizza. I understand, sometimes it just gets busy. So thank you for always taking care of me. I think drivers know they are getting a good tip from me when they deliver and I know I'm getting good food from smiling faces. Thank you for everything."}
{"text":"Rude employees (some) and rude assistant manager. I called corporate finally and this store put me on a do not deliver list  their loss"}
{"text":"There service was awsome and timely but the pizza was awful. One was overcooked and the other had soggy veggies. Gross. Don't make the same mistake I did, check before you pay!!!"}
{"text":"I don't even care if my pizza isn't right or takes a little bit longer. Patrick took my call and was absolutely the best! He took his time answering my questions and was very polite! I wish everyone was as great at customer service and hospitality as he was!!"}
{"text":"3 stars... Its a cookie cutter pizza place, you get what you order and its usually pretty good aside from the occasional over done crust and lack of cheese. The \"Brooklyn\" a personal fav is pretty good hard to screw up and goes over well, it is about as good as your going to get this side of the border as far as NY style pies go!"}
{"text":"Placed my order online (one medium pizza and two orders of wings).  I accessed the tracker and noted the time frames so I knew when to leave the house and pick up this order.  The time frames were 40-60 minutes and I must note here that I live 2 miles away from this location.  So I waited 55 minutes and drove over to the store and walked up to the counter and waited 5 more minutes for a female employee to acknowledge my presence at the counter.  I said I was there to pick up my order and the female employee that I was speaking with began the search for my order.  5 more minutes later, she informed me it would be another 30 minutes before my order would be done and ready to go.  Unbelievable.  I found a seat, next to two other customers that were also waiting for their orders that they had also placed online and in through the door walks another customer looking to pick up their online order.  Meanwhile, there were pizzas backed up in their rotary oven and pizzas being boxed for delivery and they too were backing up.  No hurry or concern in the 3 workers that were present - then finally one of them grabs some of the boxed pizzas and food and fills 4 of their 'hot bags' and then tries to access the soda cooler and drops 2 of the bags filled with delivery orders.  He managed to make it out the door with great difficulty - we could not believe that he was a delivery driver and had been standing around all that time.  A very ridiculous show the Dominos employees were putting on to say the least.  This explains the cold food and mixed up orders other customers are posting in their reviews.  Mind you, this was a Tuesday night.  Not after Christmas, but a week before.  All this time no other drivers entered or exited the store while I was there inside the store (45 minutes).  I finally received my order 105+ minutes after placing my order online.  There's more to this and it's not good, but you get the idea.  No explanation from the manager (the female employee I had spoken with when I got to the store) or apologies. Typical.  Goodbye Dominos, there are more than a few competitors in close proximity of this store and they will now see a significant uptick in business.   Waiting for my order, I got into a conversation with the other frustrated customers that were waiting for their orders and the consensus was none of us will patronize this location again.  Thank you ladies and gentlemen."}
{"text":"Perfectly serviceable, which is more than I can say for a lot of pizza places.  During a weekend get-together with friends, we decided to make this our choice on Canada Day, as we had few options and this restaurant was one of the few that was open in the city. We ended up going for three of the 4-topping walk-in specials and came away satisfied, if nothing else.  People tell me that Domino's is one of the best pizza chains out there. That may be true, but it only really applies if you eat the pizza within an hour of so of ordering it. Any longer and it becomes chewy and cardboard-like. That said, I enjoyed each of the pizzas I tried (meat lovers, veggie and Hawaiian), though I wasn't too big on the crust.  If I'm back in the area again, I'll likely make this a destination if I want pizza. Despite being in a bit of a sketchy mall, the service and quality is fine."}
{"text":"Always fresh, hot and exactly what we ordered.  Friendly and professional delivery service no matter what time of day or evening.  The location on Farm Rd is our go to place for last minute meals because they are quick to get our order delivered.  Thank you much for the great service and delicious pizzas."}
{"text":"Started coming here after being treated like trash by Pizza Nova across the street.  Website and app are amazing! easy to use, fast and convenient. Staff is attentive and quick. Can't go wrong with the pan pizza, well done."}
{"text":"50% Mondays are the best! Other coupon deals are good too. They have messed up my orders sometimes, but I'm usually not too bothered by it. The pizza sauce is a bit zesty but I enjoy it."}
{"text":"Went there tonight and the cheese didn't even cover the pizza. Couldn't even taste the cheese at all. Very disappointed customer. Will not be back!"}
{"text":"Ordered pizza on line. Never got conf. e-mail. Pked up pizza & it was cold & the ingredients were sparse.  Won't b ordering from them again!"}
{"text":"Used to be my favorite but it's kinda pricey..:( But still have the good taste remembered in my memory."}
{"text":"I can't give a zero.  834 pm ordered 2 pizzas, given delivery time of 35-45 minutes. 847 pm went through quality check then they sat there until 917 pm when they went out for delivery.  Delivered 949 pm. Dried out and ice cold. Tried to heat them but they were too dried out. Don't say 35-45 minutes if it is going to be an hour  & a half! Would never recommend this place!!! The Worst customer service ever!!!"}
{"text":"Pizza is hot and correct here! Best chain as far as delivery in the area! Everyone is accommodating with last minute changes. Always order from here."}
{"text":"I'm done. The food and service has been getting worse and worse. It started out as simple as forgetting a topping every single time, then the food started getting sent out either cold or smashed to the lid of the box... now they've progressed to food that the last 3 times in a row made us all sick. Having been a level 4 manager at one point myself, I gave them numerous chances. More than I should have. I figured maybe the garlic parm sauce or Alfredo sauce got left out too long or perhaps one of their assistant managers changed dates on some of the toppings. Stuff happens and I have always given them the benefit of the doubt. After seeing what they sent out to me tonight however, I decided that I am ALL done. If they can't drive to another store and pick up proofed dough instead of sending out green dough and making their customers seriously ill with major gastrointestinal distress... they don't deserve anymore of my hard earned money. Unfortunately my kids downed a couple slices before I noticed the dough being totally f*cked! They've been crapping their brains out all night. I have inflammatory bowel disease. If i had not known what this was and eaten it myself, dominos would be paying for my hospital stay tonight. Shame on the manager who allowed his food to go out. Yes Seth I know it was you."}
{"text":"Horrible service, ordered delivery and was told half an hour. Guy didn't show up until two phone calls and an hour and a half later! NEVER AGAIN! The manager was rude on top of it all."}
{"text":"I had pizzas at this store few times. The toppings were very little and same every time. They have good deals sometimes. It's not too bad but if I have to choose between Dominos and Pizza Hut, Dominos would never be my choice."}
{"text":"These guys/gals are great. Food is pipping hot when it arrives and all the drivers are engaging, courteous and without being a bunch of \"Chatty Cathys\"  Regardless of pickup or delivery the people and the food is very good. I'm not a big store chain store type but I also realize that each franchise is 100% unique and these people do it right!!!!"}
{"text":"Perhaps the planets were aligned today, because the new horizon probe just reached Pluto, but these were the friendliest people dishing up pies!    My son has turned me on to their Brooklyn style pizza, and I have to say, it was good! Not gourmet good...but solid good.     Thanks guys for making my night with your cheerful greetings and friendly patter. \"I\"ll be back\" because you just terminated my hunger! ( OK, terrible joke, But ya gotta admit yelping dominos is a little \"puny\".)"}
{"text":"We order pizza here often. We really love the thin crust pizza and cinnastix. Delivery is quick"}
{"text":"I order from this store all the time and they do a great job! We special order too (light sauce, half and half pizzas etc) and they always come out exactly as we ordered them and piping hot. We tend to order a lot during the week and around 5pm so I don't know if this helps with a speedy delivery but I literally have my pizza in hand within 20 minutes of ordering. We use the dominos app which I also recommend because you can track your pizza. Kudos to the team at this store - keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"Love the Domino's Pizza Tracker with the parrot!  This is keeping the kids from asking me how much longer is it every 5 minutes!  GREAT IDEA!"}
{"text":"My daughter an I both got extreme food poisoning from this location. Most horrible experience ever! First time I've had Dominos in a long time. As Michigan residents I remember when dominos started their franchise. I will be calling the corporate office. Manager seemed to not really care at all or be concerned about checking her food stock. Although she gave a full refund it hardly makes up for feeling like I'm going to die during the past 12 hours and counting. This location gets 0 stars out of 5 stars."}
{"text":"Love this dominos location. Our pizza is always the best, I love getting the Alfredo sauce on my pizza. It's always out on time and it's prices are GREAT"}
{"text":"It's a Domino's Pizza. Nice enough staff, open late, & has a well priced carry out special. Is it the best pizza in the city? Nope! But do I come here at 1230am to satisfy a late night pizza craving with their walk-in small pizza & drink special as opposed to getting a frozen pizza at the supermarket? You bet I do! This place is very much a delivery/carry out hub, there's 4 chairs for waiting for your pizza but no table and very little space in the customer area so plan to take your pizza elsewhere for eating"}
{"text":"Dude, I have to tell you, every time we order from here we get excited because Domino's is amazing at getting things done on time and this specific location doesn't mess up for us. But it especially excites the household if Dillon is making our pizza. You go, Dillon. You're like a by-proxy friend to the boyfriend and me."}
{"text":"This Domino's is horrible. Pizza was cold, chicken tenders over done and the bread sticks were under cooked. Undeniable. Get your shit together."}
{"text":"I ordered a large pizza with white garlic Parmesan sauce, chicken and hot sauce. After it being delivered, i look to see there is no hot sauce. This isn't the first time they've done this. I call the store and the manager said they'll send a new one in 45-50 minutes. They did deliver faster than that but the SECOND PIZZA still DID NOT HAVE HOT SAUCE. Now i have two pizzas without hot sauce that's going to the trash and now I've been on hold for the manager AGAIN for over 10 minutes already."}
{"text":"Excellent customer service specially from the manager Jackie. Food was delicious and fresh from the oven."}
{"text":"This is the worst pizza ever. They keep claiming they've improved it, and it is still awful. Don't bother."}
{"text":"This shop consistently provides terrible customer service.  Not once has an order came in less than an hour,  but the pizza is good and usually they've been apologetic.  This time,  however,  they lied and said they had called and rang our doorbell (not 1 missed call on my phone). No apologies,  just hung up on us when we asked for a refund. We will never order from here again"}
{"text":"I normally like your guy's pizzas and sides but this?? I'm a little confused this was supposed to make up for the mishap of sending marinara with cinnastix. The pasta, pizza and chicken bites are mediocre of that. The pasta was hard in most spots. The chicken cooked so much the sauce is like burnt. And the pizza left a weird taste in our mouths. I seriously feel that these employees were told we complained and gave this to us as a fuck you... I wouldn't even give this to my damn dog.. we \"ate\" about an hour ago and we both feel like throwing up  I posted it twice on facebook and miraculously it disappears both times"}
{"text":"Okay, so even though I received an incorrect order from them, I received the best customer service from any establishment I've ever been to. The staff was about 10 people and everyone was so nice. I praise the manager for running such a great crew. Everyone was so apologetic for the mistake and was extremely accommodating. I received a full refund and two free pies as an offer. I felt like a vauled customer here. Thank you!"}
{"text":"The Manager refused to correct my order and said it was my fault in a rude tone after a computer glitch from ordering online. They have the worst costumer service. Would not recommend to anyone, However the driver was nice and professional he should be running the store.  Update:  I moved this review from a one star to a three star because an hour later they brought me a new pizza, so I truly appreciate the service. I just wished he would believed me before I had to scrape the cheese off the first pizza.   Will order again over phone but maybe not online for a while!"}
{"text":"We just went in to pick up our pizzas and the music that was being played was extremely inappropriate. I was insulted and appalled by their choice of music being played in a public environment that I should be able to walk my kids or family into. This has happened multiple times coming into this location. You should really rethink the music that your customers are hearing and having to listen to."}
{"text":"Love this store. In over 6 years of ordering from this Domino's, they have never disappointed, never been late, never delivered a crap product - and that says something. The Drivers are always fast and polite.    Pizza Pro Tip: Do yourself a favor when you find a good pizza joint - tip the driver WELL. They will remember you, and your pizza orders will start to take priority to them. This matters because they get the opportunity to inspect your order before taking it to you. Leave a crappy tip or no tip at all, all of a sudden your pizzas start to be delivered cold, or of lesser quality. This is probably because they were delivering to my house first, and to the other houses that tip well. =)  Thanks El MIrage Domino's. You guys rock!"}
{"text":"Love their new menu and my food isn't burnt anymore. My daughter loves the Parmesan bread bites although they don't come with marinara. Picking up the pizza is always gonna be better though, since there IS a charge for delivery, plus food will be hotter."}
{"text":"I haven't had Dominos in a decade. The pizza was above average compared to the papa John's and pizza hut in Euclid, and the service experience was better as well.  This is a brand new Dominos location, replacing  the old Happy's Pizza, which replaced the old Arthur Teacher's. The inside is spacious, with 2 registers for faster checkout and some dine-in seating, and overall very clean. The parking lot is a one-way entrance and exit, so be sure to pull in the western most driveway and circle around or else you will park the wrong way.  The best part of ordering Dominos was their pizza tracker. It tells you exactly where your pizza is in the process and the name of the employee responsible for each step, very cool. We ordered a large pepperoni pizza with parmesan garlic twists for carry-out and were the 88th customer ever for this location.   The pizza was well cooked, had a good amount of toppings and sauces, and is exactly what you hope your pizza will be. I would have preferred a spicy or more flavorful sauce but for the price you can't beat it. The parm garlic twists were outstanding, well seasoned, somewhat crispy outside and warm buttery soft inside. I highly recommend the garlic dipping sauce with them. The garlic sauce is almost as good as papa John's!  I hope this place stays as consistently good in the future as it was for its 88th order."}
{"text":"First, the food is always good. I know it can vary by location but this one is consistent. My gripes:  1) my food has never been hot. I get an alert that the pizza is out of the oven and 15 mins later an alert that it is on its way. I'm less than half a mile from the store and it still takes another 20+ minutes.  2) I never receive the sauces I order. I've probably lost $5 in sauces by now. I asked one driver to just credit it back and he panicked saying he would get in trouble for forgetting them. He was actually going to give me $0.50 from his pocket.  3) the drivers never follow the directions I provide. I live in a small but confusing complex. I give specific directions to get to my front door but every one that comes up tells me how hard it was to find my place. (Maybe that's why my food is so cold?)  I haven't worked in food service in many, many years but I would think you would read your entire order before leaving the store. It would save everyone some frustration."}
{"text":"Food tasted good, but was delivered luke warm at best.  Do not order the parmesan bites without getting lots of sauce, they come with no sauce at all and are very dry.  We thought that was a mistake and when we called the store, they confirmed they do not even come with one sauce included."}
{"text":"Came into this Dominos at about 11PM since we where craving some pizza and saw that this dominos had just opened up so we stopped by.   We where immediately greeted as we walked in by the employee making the pizza's which was a nice touch. We then found our way to the counter where the girl took our order, they where out of a few things and let us know what we could substitute instead to make it taste just as great so that was nice of them. They did take a little longer to make the pizzas but they only had one guy making them and he was actually the manager so he was busy cooking and training the other staff, so for that reason I understand why it took a little longer.  Overall a good dominos near my house where the staff is nice and friendly and they have tables inside so if you chose to eat inside you can as well."}
{"text":"Fresh out of my mouth after a bite of this Philly Cheese Steak Sandwich... This is no joke, taken 3/17/2017 and confirmed by management that it was from one of their employees, I DARE YOU TO DENY THIS, DOMINOS!  Why did wait so long to post this? Let me explain. After taking a bite of this sandwich, I felt something crunchy in between my teeth that didn't seem to go along with the consistency of ingredients I was used to (and trust me, I am very familiar with the sandwich because it used to be my favorite). I was infuriated, as any mentally sane person would be to find somebody's full acrylic nail with jewels IN MY FOOD, and not only in my food, but in between my teeth. That has got to be the most unhygienic thing I've ever seen in my entire experience of eating food.  So I angrily drove down to the Domino's in which I ordered the pizza from (VAL VISTA AND WARNER, Gilbert AZ), mind you I had ordered delivery, but still chose to drive there in a fit of anger (can you blame me?).   The amazing Domino's customer I am, my order was over $40... I'm basically a regular.  The reason why I didn't write this review in March was because I felt that the manager I spoke with handled the situation very well (Hi Benjamin, you were awesome, and have great people skills).  He refunded me for my food, remade my sandwich, and promised me TWO orders of whatever I wanted. He said and I quote I could come in with a $70 order if I wanted to and it would be free, and I he annotate that on my account l... He was very apologetic, he said they would take care of the girl who's nail it was, and asked over and over if I needed anything else. Initially I was going to go to corporate and complain, but the way he handled the situation, I felt that there was no need. Three months later I made my first order, and had no problems.  I don't remember how much the order was, but it was quite a few pizzas more than I'm used to ordering.  Today, I went to use my second order... I'm not gonna lie, I had quite a few items on this order like last time, not totaling over $70, but hey! Unlimited is unlimited, so why not use this to feed my family who is visiting from out of town?  This is where I ran into some issues. I spoke to a different gentleman, not the same manager who help me initially, who looked over the notes and said that I was incorrect in that my order would be free.  I explained the situation, in which he replied that I was never promised a lifetime full of pizza. I am well aware that I wasn't supposed to get a lifetime of pizza out of it, but I was under the impression that my second order would go as smoothly as it did the first time.  This is what was agreed upon, and I felt that it was fair at the time of the incident.  He said that I was only supposed to get two free pizzas out of it, but out of the kindness of his heart would he take care of four of the pizzas. I told him to cancel my order. I understand that accidents happen, and sometimes employees get it wrong, which should really not be at the fault of the company, but when management deals with the problem, and comes up with a solution for the customer, the company needs to hold up their end. This is unacceptable when it comes to practicing business. I felt like I could have went all the way up to corporate and gotten free pizza for life if I wanted to, but quite frankly I'm not a greedy person. The only reason why I wanted to take advantage of this offer was because that was the offer put on the table by management.  I am absolutely done with Domino's as a company, I will never recommend this particular location of Domino's and if anyone ever inquires my opinion of Domino's pizza, I will go ahead and repeat this experience, in hopes that no one else has to eat fingernails from this billion dollar franchise!"}
{"text":"ordered online said 27-37 minutes its been over an hour and still nothing. I called the store and I have been on hold 10 minutes just to cancel the stupid order.  Just called back and put on hold again and its 2pm not dinner or lunch hours.  Now I have been on hold 15 minutes.  I am inclined to say they are not answering on purpose.  I have called back 3 times and now I am furious.  The tracker said it sat there for 45 minutes before it even went out on delivery.  I see a lot of negative reviews even this week.  Time to email the corporate office!"}
{"text":"This location has really become much better in the past year. Delivery is always super quick, hot food and accurate orders delivered on a consistent basis. Keep it up !"}
{"text":"Ordered a pizza from this location last week and ended up with food poisoning - not fun at all and will never order dominos ever again thanks to vomiting for hours and hours."}
{"text":"Close to my house which means FAST delivery and the Handmade Pan Pizza with White Sauce is theeeeeee best! So happy they have improved since my last couple of orders! If I'm in need of a pizza night I will always order from this location until I move :)"}
{"text":"I am a little susprised to be reviewing dominoes, but their new pizza is actually quite good. Two medium pizzas for $6 each, I didn't expect much, but it was fantastic. $12 for 3 people and we were good to go. It was very fast too. Surprisingly, it is quite good. Give it a try."}
{"text":"They advertised a 50% off online pizza orders. I ordered pizza an hour and 15 minutes ago. I called and they said it just came out of the oven. They said they were slammed because of the coupon. If you advertise that, you should have the staff to back it up!!!! BOO!!!!!"}
{"text":"I called for and order and after 11:40 do not even think about calling in an order they will never pick up the phone. The closing time clearly  states 12 AM but they should say 11:30 pm that's when business stops taking orders .   Very disappointing .I will never order again from this lazy assume and lame location and I plan to let everyone to not bother ordering late."}
{"text":"Hope this is the right store... I usually don't write reviews cuz I know they can hold a lot of weight so I just usually steer clear... anyways I called in clearly frustrated from another dominos store after ordering online and them not answering the phone because I needed to cancel that order and I believe she said her name was Jaleshia (sorry my phone was kind of breaking up!) she was the GM I think, but she was super nice and went as far as to call that other store and fix that up. It isn't even the money it's the fact that I called that other store for 30 mins straight with no answer but good to know dominos has people who know how to do their stuff. She even called me to follow up... like whoa it's 11pm and she cared enough to follow up with me. Totally impressed with this store and I am not easily impressed. So I just really wanted her to get her recognition cuz I was very upset and hungry and she was really helpful and made me feel a lot better. Thank you for your customer service!"}
{"text":"If it's after 10pm apparently they don't know how to answer the phone. I called, I kid you not, 13 times in a row for 30 mins straight trying to cancel an order. Thankfully another dominos store can do their job and your job. I never write reviews but cmon if a phone rings answer it... really isn't a hard concept- comin from someone that's worked real restaurants for a majority of their life. So glad I don't live in Tempe anymore and have to deal with lazy BS from workers that are prob stoned off their ass."}
{"text":"Worst service ever! I am 1.8 miles from the dominos with a delivery schedule of 24-34 minutes from the email receipt from when I ordered. I placed my order at 9:01pm and the pizza still hasn't arrived at 10:00pm. I call dominos at 10:01 she looks up my address and says \"yes your pizza is on the way\" I say \"I know that because you have a tracker and it says it left at 9:33pm, The order said it would take between 24-34 minutes.\" She states \"oh you're using the tracker well that doesn't always work\" I say \"okay that's fine but when will my pizza be here it says it left 33 minutes ago?\" \"I'm not sure but it has left so it should get there soon\" this service is awful and I wish I would have read the reviews from this terrible Dominos before I ordered. The food finally showed up at 10:09pm. I open the door and the delivery man hands me the receipt waits for me to sign before taking the food out. I said can \"I check the food?\" and he said \"yea once you sign\". I told him \"if he wants a tip he needs to hand me the food so I can verify it's what I ordered.\"  The driver was still going to get a 20% because I always tip because they have a thankless job and it may not have been his fault it was late, but now that he showed up and was so impolite he got $2 and that's only because I couldn't bare to give him nothing. I accidentally forgot to take my receipt. My charge better not show up on my credit card for more than $27.07.  This is the worst dominos I've ever ordered from. The lady that answered the phone tonight and the delivery guy are worthless and will be the reason for more negative reviews on you store."}
{"text":"It's been a few years, and they've moved down the road to 14212 Detroit Ave.  I recall hearing on the news that Domino's had re-vamped their menu. Well, I finally got around to trying it, and damn, it's actually quite good! Might be my favorite out of the national chains now. I'm really impressed with their turnaround. Way to go!"}
{"text":"Regardless to what day of the week or what time of day, I have not been able to receive hot Pizza and or breadsticks from this location when delivered.  Even if the order is waiting in the store for an hit in the warmer, which happens often, and I call and request it be re-made prior to delivery!!! Apology after apology is not acceptable and offering to redo if I am willing to wait another hour is ridiculous.    Poor customer service, understaffed and poor management."}
{"text":"I love Dominos.  Anytime, I don't want to cook, I just order online for Dominos. It's fast, easy and efficient and the food is great with lot of choices to fit my tummy."}
{"text":"EW!!! People still eat this manufactured crap.  It is worse than the other chain pizza joints!!"}
{"text":"I have had nothing but good experiences with this location. The delivery is timely and the order has always been correct. Having teenagers, we order  twice a month."}
{"text":"Staff is friendly but pizza is BAD! Pizza over cooked, toppings spread thinly and taste average. Highly disappointed.."}
{"text":"This is the only place that delivers to my area. I have never had any problems with my orders. Depending on the day and time, the wait time changes, nevertheless the longest I had to wait was about 45 to an hour. Waiting an hour is not the big of a problem for me."}
{"text":"Dominos customer service is why I am writing this review. A handful of times, our pizzas have been delivered with the wrong toppings/ on the wrong side. However, their willingness to fix it and ensure we are returning customers is awesome as most companies just wash their hands of the situation. We will definitely continue to order from this dominos!"}
{"text":"45 minutes from finish to delivery, 1 hour from order, how could you possibly get a hot fresh pizza???"}
{"text":"Order a cheese pizza with garlic crust and got a cheese pizza with more sauce than cheese and no garlic crust. In fact the crust looked like a FOOT THAT'S DRY AND CRACKED ON THE HEEL. This Dominos is really hit and miss. My daughter ordered boneless wings and the portions were ridiculous. They looked like they took the normal sized portions and cut them in half. I included a picture for laughs. So, tonight's food was really under par. Big thumbs down!"}
{"text":"I am really disappointed in this Domino's.  I ordered a Large with extra cheese pepperoni Italian sausage onions bell peppers and black olives.  There was no extra cheese.  In fact  approximately 20% of My Pizza contained NOTHING BUT CRUST not even sauce!!! Really nothing but bread.  I ordered this Pizza and paid $18.49 for something I could have picked up in the frozen food department at the Grocers.  I can't believe how sparsely covered this Pizza was.  I ordered this exact Pizza while in Hollywood California.........THEY KNOW WHAT A REAL PIZZA SHOULD BE!!  That was my first and last order from this place.  A lesson bought is a lesson learned."}
{"text":"Just want to alert the manager to let their employees know that it is ILLEGAL to refuse water to someone in Arizona. Popped in here during an evening walk last night really needing a cup of water. The employee (man with some kind of braid ponytail) was extremely rude and after I told him it was illegal he said it's because they don't have cups. I am not a homeless person, I wasn't intoxicated or disturbing the peace. I live very close by and it would be wise for a business to extend courtesy to local residents, you never know what business you're going to lose."}
{"text":"I ordered my \"free\" medium pizza the other day and it had no cheese! So i guess since i just paid for the delivery i get no cheese on my pizza. I even doubled checked my order and it said peporoni pizza, red sauce and CHESSE! Ive never had any issues with this location but from the looks of the reviews on here they just dont care about there \"customer service\"."}
{"text":"Best gluten free pizza around, little pricey for such a small pizza. But they deliver fast and hot! Drivers are polite. I'm definitely going to be return customer. But coupons for gf would be great. Hint hint!"}
{"text":"So it's been a while since I've ordered anything from this location.  Since my last review I have ordered food from the Allison Park location and received excellent service.  They even gave me extra marinara for my order.   On a whim I decided to give this forest hills location another try.  Knowing that they were likely to mess up my order, I called during the \"quality check\" on the Domino's tracker to make sure they wouldn't forget the salad dressing and the marinara.  The guy assured me they they wouldn't and that the order was about to go out the door.  This was @ 8:32 pm.  9:22 pm rolls around and I finally get the knock on my door and guess what..... no marinara.... not only am I baffled that they forgot the marinara when I called specifically so they wouldn't but why did a 5 minute drive take 50 minutes?  Please corporate Domino's, fix this location once and for all."}
{"text":"Just started ordering from Domino\"s Pizza recently and I am not disappointed at all. :) The driver was nice and the food is excellent. No complaints what so ever!"}
{"text":"Really nice people working at the counter, and delivering.  Domino's is a chain, but this store is locally owned and operated by a really great family.  Prices are great and the online ordering works like a charm!  Highly recommend this location."}
{"text":"This is my second bad experience in a row. Me think Papa Johns from now on since they don't respect my business.   Ordered online (had issues with it saying couldn't process my request) Got confirmation email saying 19-29 min. Great, hop in shower. Get out to check phone to see if maybe they had called. Yes, and 1 min after I ordered? What??? Called the number and was told my order was canceled because it was a hotel delivery. Say what? So, you called once, a number known to Dominoes for years, and cancel my order??? Ok so I call. I think the brilliant Alihandro (or how ever it is spelled) was quite RUDE and unhelpful. The kicker is I confirm the order, then one minute later change my mind and call to dance. The phone rings and rings. Then says \"the subscriber is not available\" --- is this a real dominoes!? Where is the transfer to the phone lines when it's busy? Tried calling over 15 times from various phones and same result or the line just cutting off or a prompt of some kind. WTF?    Worst dominoes on earth."}
{"text":"Called to order a late night pizza tonight at 11PM, we asked to have it deliver since we live 5 minute away we did not think it would take long.... An hour later and still no pizza, my boyfriend calls and asks them how much longer it's going to be. A kid, tells us that the driver came to our home and know one came to the door (we live in an apartment) and first they said someone answered the phone when they tried to call but never came out! We let them know no one had called us or knocked at the door.. This kid actually says to us that we are trying to just \"prank\" them!!!! I call back and ask to speak with a manager another kid says he is the manager & said that no one ever answered and now tells us that no one answered the phone when they called.. I asked him what # and it was a completely different number then either of ours.. ( the correct  # is how they pulled up our address when we placed the order initially).. He offered to make the pizzas and deliver them but i don't understand why the pizza would have to be made if they had tried delivering them?!?!?! Will not order there again & will be looking to speak with someone at cooperate or higher manager tomorrow!"}
{"text":"This place charges for peppers and napkins?? Really?  I'll just get my pizza at Little Caesars from now on!! $5 and no extra charge for peppers and napkins. Dominos sucks!!"}
{"text":"Really like the place, the online promotions usually give very good deals so you can pay much less and get more.  They're not shy on the toppings and the cheese, and the pan pizza tasted exceptionally good. The thin pizza tasted more like baked nachos as it was perhaps too thin."}
{"text":"Person on phone was rude and argued with me just now I hung up and called the other dominoes down the road"}
{"text":"Not sure why this place has horrible ratings but I had my pizza cooked pretty damn well. No complains, plenty of toppings and cooked well done within a short period of time. To be honest best domino's pizza I have ever had from a domino's franchise. My first time and definitely not last so will update my comment after next visit. The cashier was very nice, friendly and polite."}
{"text":"The good:  very easy to order online, quick delivery and the parmesan bread bites are awesome. The bad:  Regular pizzas tend to be a bit on the greasy side and the crust can be a bit too mushy for my taste. The ok:  The new Artisan pizzas have a nice crunchy crust (which I like), but they seem kind of skimpy on toppings.    All in all, if you are mainly looking for a convenient way to get dinner to the table Dominos will work for you.  If you are mainly looking for fabulous tasting pizza, Dominos may not be the best choice."}
{"text":"Dominos pizza is good/ok but not great in my opinion. Many of my friends vote it as their favorite pizza but I have to disagree and I don't think they have tried many pizza besides this, little caesars, and pizza hut. It's very ordinary, and it certainly gets the job done when you are in the mood for pizza though. I like the bread but the crust leaves a lot to be desired. Their cinnamon sticks are good especially when you get the dipping cream.   I am yet to try the wings. I was once going to order them but my standards are so high on wings I decided to try it another day. The breadsticks aren't as good as other places. For instance, papa johns has the greatest breadsticks, so fluffy and chewy! Dominos are straight, same shape, nothing extraordinary and are just ok.   Dominos certainly has come along way and they have a lot to choose from whether it be sandwiches, pasta, and chicken, but I haven't tried any of this and honestly because it doesn't look attractive. The desserts are decent and the lava cake is nice and sweet. Also the price is good with dominos so that is something it has going for it."}

{"text":"I love the pizza from this place. It's really cheap if you order carryout, and I think it tastes and looks really good. They never skimp on toppings and it's always really warm, even after I carry it home in the winter. Their online wait estimate is pretty accurate, and the staff is always really friendly."}
{"text":"We planned a kids birthday party called two day in advance to see what we needed to do.  They said just place the order as usual in the morning. So when they opened at10:00 am we placed the order on line for 10 pizzas and wings for a 11:30 delivery. Well the pizza tracker showed no progress at 10:30 so we called and they did not answer the phone. We kept calling and they finally answered at about 11:20 and did not even have the pizza started.  The 5 and 6 year olds kids were very grumpy and hungry. One was crying. Well we ended up getting the delivery at around 12:30 with 2-3 raw pizza and 3-4 with all the cheese and toppings stuck to the lid. Several of us feel really sick like the pizzas were bad. Terrible experience.  Use your judgment as to if you want to take this risk for your parties. I think other pizza places are more reliable and a better bet."}
{"text":"Too lazy to cook, too hot to cook. Ooh. Let's get Domino's. Downloaded their app (easy to use, shows prices with tax AND delivery charge) ordered supper and right on the dot my buzzer buzzed and I got my pizzas. Paid, went inside, opened the box and cue the \"what the hell is this?!\".  It looked as though someone had sucked the air out of my pizza. I'm talking like cheese and sauce and toppings on a piece of cardboard. Check the label on the box and it says pan pizza. Look at the pizza. Not pan pizza. Crisp thin crust pizza. Sad face. Call the shop,  sorry we messed up.  You keep this pizza and next time you order we take care of it.  Meh. OK. I'd have rather waited for my regular pizza.  But thanks."}
{"text":"After ordering a buffalo chicken sandwich I bit into it there was no chicken just a hot mess of buffalo sauce. This place is horrible I gave them a chance to redeem themselves but nope they failed again!"}
{"text":"We always order Pizza Hut so we decided to try something different. I downloaded the Dominos Pizza app and reviewed their menu and specials. We decided to go with the following special: 2 medium pizzas with 2 toppings for $5.99 each. Sounds like a real deal, right? Not really. You see what they fail to tell you is that if you want pan crust, it will cost extra. Since we were trying to be cheap this night, I went with the regular ole hand tossed crust. Folks if you want to know what cardboard tastes like, just order dominos hand tossed pizza. It's absolutely nauseating. Now to be clear, I've never actually eaten cardboard, but if I did, I think this is what it would taste like. In general the pizza lacked flavor and was overall unsatisfying.    To be fair, I will say the delivery time was quick and their app is a tad more tech savvy than Pizza Hut.  If you're going to order off the app don't make the same mistake I did. If you select all of the items you want on your pizza and go back and change the crust type be sure that the toppings you selected are still there. Mine weren't. I was very disappointed when one of my pizzas was just cheese. :(   Due to the fact that the crust reminded me of cardboard , I'll probably never eat there again."}
{"text":"Corporate and stores can't figure out what they're doing communication wise.... Person in store told me to disregard anything the pizza tracker says and said I should cancel my order if I didn't want a pizza that had been prepared over 30 minutes ago according to their tracker."}
{"text":"I can't get over the fact that I paid $18.77 for a medium deep dish pizza.  Medium--enough for two of us if I can control the other eater.  Asked for pepperoni and sausage.  Check the picture to see if you see sausage. Put on your glasses AND your contacts.   I only agreed to pay for this ridiculous amount because my granddaughter wanted it and you know how that goes.  As you see a day later, I just had to Yelp about this atrocity.  And now I will tell you what added insult to injury.  I asked for red pepper flakes and the guy behind the counter told me I could buy a small shaker of red pepper flakes from them.  Really?  I laid out $$$$$$$$$18.77 for a MEDIUM pizza that had virtually no sausage in it and you want to charge me for red pepper flakes?????????  How much are the napkins, pray tell????  Update:  Saturday, August 8, 2015:  I was contacted by Domino's Customer Service and they   apologized and took care of the issue.  Thanks to Domino's for reaching out to its customers."}
{"text":"I ordered online and my food was ready to pickup within 15 minutes. The handmade pan pizza tasted great and the staff attended to me in about a minute of walking through the door. I will continue to buy from this store in the future."}
{"text":"Bought online - pretty straight forward. The tracker is cool because you know the status of your order. Delivery guy was nice and conversational. He actually may have liked his job! Which says something about Dominos IMO...and FYI I gave 4 stars because the Marinara sauce pack was already open...no one's perfect!"}
{"text":"less than acceptable cheese on the pizzas, good toppings on everything else"}
{"text":"This place sucks. They stop answering their phone and won't deliver 30 minutes before they close."}
{"text":"Very Good Pizza!   Ordered a veggie thin crust pizza and pepperoni pizza. Lots of toppings and made well done.   Was done in about 15-25 min and there is seating when waiting for order.   Staff was polite, however no one greeted us upon arrival. The Tablet has a list of people who ordered and check in. Unfortunately, the tablet didn't work.   Condiments & napkins were given. Parking is available as it's located in a shopping center."}
{"text":"We ordered a pizza for pickup, I went into the store to pick it up.  This is CRAZY........  I stood there at the cash register for 5 minutes and watched all the employees running around filling orders, making pizza's etc.  Finally one of the pizza delivery guys asked me if I had been helped, I said \"NO, I'm just waiting to pick up my pizza and wings which are sitting right there\" he looked at me and started packing up his pizza's for delivery.  So then another 2 minutes goes by and the same guy asked me again if I had been helped, again I said NO!!!!  Then he ignored me, grabbed his pizza's and left.  At this time I still have not been helped, there were 10 employees but no one would acknowledge me!!!!  Finally I got someone's attention and said I have a pickup that has been sitting there that is probably cold, he gave me the pizza and wings but forgot to give me the liter bottle of coke.  Good gosh, drove all the way home and had to go back again and get the soda.  By the way the wings looked and tasted terrible!!!!  Not sure if we will be back."}
{"text":"A quick in and out location for me as I order the pizzas and cheese bread for pick up. The service was great didn't have to wait that much as the pizza was ready in 15 minutes, which is nice!  The service was good and the Pizza and Bread was made perfectly with the right amount of toppings."}
{"text":"Came in to pick up a Pizza & a \"Jennifer\" was standing at the counter I asked her a question & she ignored me... so the next available person came & asked if I needed help. He was very sweet. While he was ringing me up she hovered over him smacking on Pickle ripping him apart with her mouth full. It's truly sad to see employees treated poorly as well as her LACK of customer service on her behalf. I only gave 2 stars because of the young Man who checked me out he was very nice otherwise it would of been none."}
{"text":"I just want to throw in a quick review of this Domino's because of the terrible reviews I have seen. I work downtown and decided to pick up a pizza and a two liter of pop for dinner that evening. I placed my order online and the website said my order would be ready in about 20 minutes. Around 20 minutes later, I stopped over at Dominos to pick up my pizza and pop. The man who greeted me, the manager (I forget his name!) was very sweet and friendly upon m arrival. I told him the name for my order and it wasn't quite done yet. I'm naturally an easy going person, so I just took a seat to wait until it was done. Apparently the gentleman felt bad because of the wait so he said I can take a two liter of my choice home as a 'thank you' for waiting. He then looked at my order and noticed I ordered a two liter of Coke Zero.. Which they did not have in the store. So then, he told me to take about 4 Coke Zero smaller bottles since he had no 2-liters. I didn't have to wait much longer for my food, so all of that was not necessary. But I wanted to write a review, because the customer service was terrific and my pizza was delicious also! :)"}
{"text":"Horrible place they are not nice on customer service and  I asked for a drinking cup they don't have it that's sounds bad I bought a Coke and I have to drink from the bottle"}
{"text":"The high reviews of this place are well earned. I'm not comparing their pizza to dine in facilities but to delivery stores and these guys are awesome. Plenty of coupons online, I didn't use any cause I was in a rush and needed food ASAP and they delivered. Fast, earlier than stated, and the dough was delicious for delivery."}
{"text":"I know this sounds crazy but I love the pizza. The best fast food pizza out here. I the reason why I hate it so much is because of the service.  I understand that you guys might have 10 or 15 orders at once but that doesn't mean the customer service should go down.  I ordered online and it told me my order would take 40 mins. After reaching that mark it said it was out for delivery.  An additional 30 minutes went by without my food and I'm sitting here wondering why. I called and she told me that it's going to be another 10 minutes before I get my food after waiting for almost over an hour. As I look at my meal I noticed that I ordered some wings and didn't get my Ranch. I called the store and the guy said that it would take probably another 30 minutes for them to bring back me some ranch. So, I told him don't worry about I just wanted to inform him that they messed up and they didn't have to bring me any. Then he rudely hung up on me. Kinda makes me no want to order from them again or at least not this particular location which sucks."}
{"text":"Long day and all u want is a good slice?  DO NOT go here.  Wings are covered in fat and the hot sauce lacks flavor. Maybe it was because it was not hot when it arrived because the driver got lost. : / I still tipped her and we ate it but.....fool me once, and once only. #Unsatisfied"}
{"text":"I've ordered at this location a few times now and this was the first time that my pizza didn't come out great.  Well, I guess you can't win'em all!"}
{"text":"That moment when your waiting 45 - 50 min for a pizza and they don't have your order complete."}
{"text":"I order from them frequently. It is always hot and fresh and fast. My order is always correct. They have won my business for a long time. Thank you to the management and crew of the Bradley street Dominoes!"}
{"text":"My favorite pizza! But for some reason this location doesn't hire good drivers. I live less than 10minutes away and sometimes I want delivery. Shouldn't take 30 minutes for delivery and get cold food. Figured I let the world know since customer loyalty is no longer valued."}
{"text":"Faire attention aliment pas frais trois personne de malade cette nuit après avoir manger la pizza"}
{"text":"Worst service of my life.....I was their only costumer in their lot and the employee went out of her way to step outside and  yelled at me that I couldn't park there within 2 seconds of me parking my car. I was headed to the dominos and  if she calmed down for a minute she would have seen that but they lost their only customer. Good job"}
{"text":"Stopped in here twice now for carry out. Asked if they had any specials. They offer a large 3-topping pizza for $7.99, Mon-Thur, in either thin crust or hand tossed. Not the best pizza I've ever had, but certainly better than most.   They were busy the first time we went, but took our order promptly. The second time was about 11pm, and it was ready in ten minutes."}
{"text":"Quick and efficient service and not to mention friendly staff. I walked in twice and each time, I was greeted with a smile. I was in and out in less than 20 minutes; if that. I loved the fact that the wings weren't dry and I can actually substitute the crust for any size pizza. I was shocked that I was able to get my medium pizza with thin crust; an option rarely offered by competitors.   Clean establishment and ample parking available if you wish to enjoy your pizza inside."}
{"text":"Not a good look, placed my order @ 12:44 it's now 1:29 and I'm still waiting, this isn't what was expected from a chain that boast fast service and all the commercials on how hot and fast the service is..."}
{"text":"Ordered pizza- asked if they would deliver to our room, they said no problem, took order charged card, then called from valet to have us come down to get it. Last I checked the valet station is not our room.  Wasted our time and money when they could of said no. Still no refund."}
{"text":"Ordered pepperoni pizza through the app at 700pm. Received pizza at 743. Tipped the driver and off he ran. Received a Meatzzz pizza. Discovered the mistake 30 seconds after he ran. Looked for their # in the Domino's app but it was not there. Looked phone number up and called store at 744. Requested a remake. Told that it \"would be right out\". No pizza at 820pm. Called. It was \"on its way\". No pizza at 845. Called again. Told it was just coming out of the oven. Received correct pizza at 915pm. NOT happy. Manager said her would be happy to give us another pizza for free tomorrow. Too bad we are only in town one more day. Not interested in Domino's pizza tomorrow.  Also of note, during my frequent phone calls to this dominos, my call was often allowed to ring in for longer and longer. I suspect they had caller ID. Twice I was \"accidentally disconnected\""}
{"text":"Wtf dominoes!! U advertise on a HUGE billboard! Only to be told that online only and carry out order. But, it is impossible to either create or use an existing account!! I've been trying for over an hour!! Bullocks dominoes!!! 0 stars"}
{"text":"Ok I cant believe Im writing a 5 Star review for Dominos this certainly wasn't the result of one special delivery experience but rather a number of improvements over the past year.  First Dominos has been a company that constantly looks for ways to improve its food and menu.  They completely changed their entire sauce and crust recipe so the original pizza no longer exists and what we have now is a much better flavor profile.  They added several BBQ Chicken dishes and a bunch of new sauces such as garlic and habanero all excellent and stuffed cheezy bread.  We recently tried the new Pizza Hut out here on Pinnacle Peak and Pima three times over the last couple months because the girls wanted the stuffed crest and had very bad experience`s with order mistakes, cold pizza and limited toppings.  The fact is Pizza Hut is no longer competition for the flavors and quality you get at Dominos.  Im not saying these companies offer the best pizza Im just saying Dominos has the fastest pizza with the most flavor for the best price hands down.  The stuffed cheezy bread is off the charts the garlic sauce fantastic and they even have deep dish now.  We have ordered at least 20 times from this location of the past year and they have never made a mistake on our order.  That alone is amazing in itself.  We also ask them to crisp our pizza in the oven a little longer highly recommend that.  Great job Dominos with your menu expansion and better flavor profiles and sauces.  A well deserved review."}
{"text":"Order 45 minutes ago.... no pizza yet ... tried to call them and all i get is a very long long message....  Update: waiting for an hour no pizza yet.... on  the phone for 15 minutes and was told it will be another 45 minutes... that will make my wait time from order to deliver = 1.5 hrs"}
{"text":"So, it's Domino's, but they deliver, and that means I, 1) don't have to leave my house, 2) don't have to get dressed, and 3) don't have to cook.  Therefore, they are awesome.  Oh and the food is fabulous too; consistent quality, friendly delivery staff, and I LOVE their app and website.  The pizza tracker thingy is so nice so we know exactly when to have pants on.  We love the Fiery Hawaiian and try lots of varieties on the thin crust, which is healthier (right??)."}
{"text":"Don't waste your money at this location. Go to the dominos 2 minutes down the road on 35th and Glendale. The people at this location just don't give a shit. Every time I order from this location I get a pizza that looks like they made it with their eyes closed. Seriously, I'd say almost half of the pizza I got from them just now doesn't even have cheese or sauce on it, just cooked bread. The one down the road a little bit actually makes an effort to give you a decent product, go there instead."}
{"text":"New pizza same people who work there slow. food is ok."}
{"text":"Birthday wishes! I called dominos by our house. I had one request..: that they write the number 35 in pepperoni for my husbands birthday. I even offered to pay extra for the service. The woman on the phone said no problem ... I will even do it myself to assure it gets done. When the pizza arrived there was not a 35 written in pepperoni just a regular pepperoni pizza even though I was told this would not be an issue at all! I immediately  called dominos to speak to the manager who's name was Stephanie. This woman refused to give me her last name after I asked even though she claimed to be the manager of this resturant. Any manager of an establishment gets a biz card with a last name on it. So why a manager is scared to give her last name to a customer blows my mind. She also informed me they do nothing for special occasions or momentos for anyone of any sort. Well train your employees to know this then and maybe revamp the whole internet bc you take special requests all the time according to the web. I would of never ordered a pizza from here for this occasion if my request couldn't be filled. There are pics all over the internet of special request you take all the time -- i.e. Drawing on boxes being a huge one. This was such a minor request that was promised and a birthday was ruined because of it. We planned this surprise instead of the cake and everyone at the party was so excited to watch the birthday boy open it (he loves pepperoni pizza from dominos). Epic fail dominos we are so disappointed. Luckily we have a Pizza Hut and Joeys right next door to you that will be getting our future service. Bye Felecia!"}
{"text":"very bad service and the pizza sucks!!!! under cooked and cold.  i am going to report this place to the department of health, unhealthy place..."}
{"text":"App sucked tried and tried to get food impossible  to do, hate pizza hut pizza. Deleted app. Would not work for me. Thank goodness for uber eats."}
{"text":"Pizza like any other from franchise place. The nice difference is the staff. Never late, never forget any  piece of the order. If we feel like pizza we always order from them - to support hard working and very nice people."}
{"text":"Most of my reviews have to do with local businesses. Typically I don't tend to go to big chains and when I do I tend to hold them to a higher standard, so naturally I was prepared to be extra picky tonight. This evening I ordered Domino's for I think the first time ever in my life. Sure,  I've eaten dominoes at parties, or at friends houses but never actually taken the time to use their app and order it to my own home.  I downloaded their app for the first time today as I had seen it on Netflix being used by David Chang on his new ugly food series. The commentary about the app was that it was seamless, easy to use and resulting in a trackable quick delivery of your food.   I ordered one of their large Brooklyn style pizzas and my fiancée went with her standard custom vegetarian pizza order with thin crust. The pizzas arrived within 30 to 35 minutes and as described on the Netflix series the driver was one of the friendliest and most professional I've had the opportunity to deal with from any food delivery (and we do a fair bit of delivery since baby arrived).   Both of us were surprised by how light and tasty the crust was on our pizzas. The toppings were equally high quality, with the total product being surprisingly excellent pizza.  Now, will I order from Domino's every single time we want pizza delivery? Probably not as we do have our local spots that we still love. However whenever were in a pizza pinch and we're looking for a reliable, good tasting, affordable pizza option I can safely say that I am a Domino's convert.  Best of all, I ate an entire large and I neither feel stuffed nor do I feel ashamed with my Life choices.  Eatcrest out"}
{"text":"I ordered a pizza for delivery, waited for almost an hour, then was notified by their site that I had received the pizza. When I called the store, the manager told me I hadn't put my apartment number in the \"special instructions\" notes. The apartment number was in my delivery address. He said the system was only limited to so many characters, so I should have put my apartment number in the special instructions. They didn't call asking for my apartment number (I provided my phone number, obviously), they didn't notify me in any way that their system couldn't show the address they billed my credit card to, they just said the pizza had been delivered. The manager wasn't impolite, he was just full of you know what, just stating the system couldn't show my apartment number so I should have noted it in special instructions. And he didn't explain why the website showed it as delivered.  Don't hate Dominos, but I will NEVER order from this crappy site again.  Thought about it more, and I changed my mind. I'm not ordering from any Dominos again. They're not that great, they've never been that great, and this was the final nail.  I talked to the manager twice, first asking him why my pizza showed as delivered and I didn't get it and second to ask him why no one called me. Neither time did he ask me for my apartment number or offer to send me a replacement pizza. Don't misunderstand me - I'm not looking for a free pizza, I just wanted the pizza I'd paid for - but he never even asked me what my apartment number was that the system supposedly didn't show. I wouldn't have been happy, but I would have been cool if he'd rushed a pizza to me and the charge remained. But he didn't offer anything. He just basically told me in the most polite way that he could care less.  Yeah, I'm not going to order from any Dominos anywhere"}
{"text":"Ordered pizza on a busy day of the year and the wait time was said to be 65-75 minutes. I was okay with this since they warned me beforehand. I used their live app to track my pizza and realized it actually got put in the oven very soon after ordering which I was pleasantly surprised with. My pizza was ordered at 5:25. My pizza went in the oven around 5:35 and my pizza was \"checked for perfection\" at 5:43. At this point I figured I would be getting it soon. But the pizza was not delivered until 6:50. I was worried since it came out of the oven over an hour ago, it would be stone cold. I was right. The live tracking app is normally great. But on a busy night it is a blessing in disguise. Had to microwave my pizza since it was hard as a rock and cold. Very disappointed that my pizza was sitting in their store for an hour before leaving for delivery. I will choose a different location next time."}

{"text":"March 30, 2014  Deceptive Trade Practice - Domino's Pizza I recently received this coupon (coupon #4335) in the mail for 2 Medium 2-Topping Pizzas & a 16-Piece Order of Parmesan Bread Bites for $14.95. I placed my order from this location: Domino's Pizza, 3329 Bell Road, Phoenix, AZ 85032, 602-482-3030. I spoke with Brian first, then he put me on hold and Peter (both no last names) picked up the phone.   The conversation went as follows: Peter - quoted me $18.95, he said my coupon expired. Myself - The coupon is a recent mail offer with an expiration date of April 13, 2014 Peter - Corporate issued the coupon but did not update their system and he cannot honor nor adjust the coupon offer.  The problem is with the company headquarters regarding a false disclaimer.  Myself - The coupon offer would affect a large number of people who received this offer and would hold domino's accountable to honor their coupon in \"good faith.\" Peter - We sell a lot of pizza's it want hurt us. You're welcome to notify Corporate Headquarters about the coupon. Phone disconnects.  I was a loyal customer until a recent strings of events: bad customer service (excessive hold time), wrong order (not what ordered), and uninspiring food (greasy, pop-up bubbles and less meat). The food was replaced with fresh ingredients and preparations. With this new-enlightened not to operate in \"good faith\" or excellence was the final decision to discontinued doing business with Domino's Pizza."}

{"text":"When the family gets pizza I get wings and salad to avoid carbs. This place disappoints every time but this time is the worst. Wings were disgusting and the salad stingy. Thanks for nothing again!!!"}
{"text":"Dominos is like a roller coaster.  Sometimes very enjoyable, sometimes a long wait, and sometimes you puke at the end.    10 years ago, Dominos Pizza was disgusting.  In the past few years, they dramatically improved their pizza.  I have been amazed at some of the pizza I've had from Dominos at other locations.  Unfortunately, the pizza I got from this location was sub-par for current-day Domino Pizza standards (still way better than 10 years ago).  Delivery was very prompt.  This is pretty impressive considering the reason I was ordering pizza for delivery was because I thought the roads were too sketchy for me to go and drive on.  The thin-crust pizza, while normally very crispy and full of flavor, was a little soft and dull.  I still have hope though.  Dominos still has a relatively high \"good\" pizza percentage as a corporation.  Hopefully this pizza was just a fluke from this location."}
{"text":"I ordered wings from here and the tracker said they would arrive in 20-30 minutes, like the other reviews the food said that it was on the way with in 10 minutes of ordering. Almost an hour later and a phone call to the store my driver calls me to tell me to come down to his car to pick up my order!! What?! The wings were just ok but not enough to ever repeat this process so order with caution."}
{"text":"This location should really look at just closing up shop. For previous context, I ordered from this dominos a couple years back and after the delivery never came. I drove to the store and complained and also contacted dominos corporate directly. There manager contacted me and have me a free meal deal coupon, which I did use... As a pickup order. So I thought after a couple years maybe I  would try my luck again. Couldn't be worse than last time, right? I was wrong. I ordered a basic pizza online and it was scheduled for 50 minutes for delivery. On hour passed and I checked the status and it said the pizza delivery was out and should arrive soon. Fast forward another half hour, still no pizza. At the two hour mark I called and basically got a half hearted explanation (no apology) saying the delivery guy was new and no real context beyond that. I asked if there was any further eta on the delivery and he just said he COULD call, not that he would call. To that end I asked the person in the phone to refund my order based on my experience, not cancel. He said \"uh, ok...\" And then hung up on me. The order was refunded but the pizza never arrived. Needless to say, I am forever done with this dominos."}
{"text":"Pizza was hot and delivered in 35 minutes, not gourmet pizza, not brick oven pizza, just decent fast food pizza. Delivery driver was courteous"}
{"text":"Have always been a fan of Domino's and used to order all the time but from a different location before I moved. This location is hit and miss. Last two times I ordered the order was wrong. First time I didn't bother to complain, however when the error was made twice in a row I decided to call and voice my concern. I was told by a female employee that they would make a note on my file and we will get a free pizza next time which was great. Unfortunately when I called today to place my order I was told by the manager that he is the only one that works there on Wednesdays and that there is no way I spoke with a female last Wednesday because he is the only one that works Wednesdays. He unwilling to honour the deal therefore I will be taking my business elsewhere. I would rather pay a premium for toppers pizza and actually get what I order then to deal with rude service and wrong orders."}
{"text":"Horrible service. Cold pizza. Manager told me to come in and pick up the second order cause it would be \"hot\". I'm on crutches."}
{"text":"The pizza was well made and cooked correctly.  I eat a lot of domino's and some locations do a better job than others, for example undercooking or using too much tomato sauce, etc.  But this one was good."}
{"text":"Absulotly in love with it.. However, they take too long to deliver, but they have good service :)"}
{"text":"I have been ordering from this location since I was 17. Lately the wings have been failing. Starting to get a cheap taste to them and just a vinegar sauce dumped on them. Might switch to BBQ before I finally five up on them."}
{"text":"I've ordered delivery from them more than a few times. Tonight, I got a medium Honolulu Hawaiian & it was exactly what I wanted! They've always gotten to me very quickly! I used the app & it only took them a half hour before they were at my door. The pizza was steaming hot. Kudos!"}
{"text":"The gentleman on the phone was very polite and helpful. He even gave us a coupon for more savings"}
{"text":"I see the very nice pictures of your pizza. Sorry mine didn't look like that. It was awful, dripping with so much sauce I could put most of it on some spaghetti and had two meals. I will not be ordering again."}
{"text":"We ordered for delivery and was impressed at how fast they were. Love the ease of website ordering and the order tracker however I do feel if a company cannot do as much as provide peppers and cheese at no charge,  they are not worth my business.  I can definitely pay $1.25 each for peppers and cheese, but I would rather give my business to a company who is at least thoughtful enough to not take advantage of their customers by charging for something a little a peppers and cheese."}
{"text":"So I've ordered from this place a few times and every single time the delivery bangs on my door.. I have a door bell. I let the manager know after the first time I didn't like what his driver did and it continued to happen so my fourth time ordering I let the manager know for the 4th time pls tell your drivers not to bang on my door like they are the police and the MANAGER noticed how upset I was and didn't apologize or nothing but took it as a opportunity to cuss at me. This dominos is unprofessional! I will never spend another penny here and considering that there's a papa johns up the road I thought they would treat their loyal customers a lot better. What a shame."}
{"text":"Just had my last visit to Dominos on Grand & 101 loop. You buy a pizza and expect it to be the usual especially Dominos but when I got home it was a joke to sell such a poorly made pizza to your customers! It's Dominos same company everyone has been going to from the mid 80's for me. I bought 2 pizza one was suppose to have been sausage and ham. There was literally a few pieces of sausage on this pizza. It look like a ham pizza with not that much ham and a close up look to see any sausage because there wasn't even a piece on ever slice. My 5 year old daughter could have done a better job! Dominos you suck!!!"}
{"text":"Delivery driver barely spoke to me, have off bad vibes.  Pizza was cold. Will never ever order another pizza from this location again."}
{"text":"Ordered on a special promo night, and the employees handled all the busyness and rude people well. Offered an extra deal when we had to wait for a few minutes longer and the pizzas turned out great."}
{"text":"Un friendly and un professional nice pizza box wont even stay close."}
{"text":"Found a great deal on groupon for half off a pizza. We ordered it online and it was easy. Gave a 4 star rating because it was very dry, hardly any sauce. The crust was great and flavorful."}
{"text":"Sister and I had Domino's delivered around 11:30 was extremely hot very delicious the crust was amazing"}
{"text":"If only it were possible to give it less than a star!!! No places deserves it more than they!!! As other reviewers have pointed out, horrible customer service, horrible wait times and unbelievably incompetent staff!!! A place like this shouldn't exist!!"}
{"text":"My entire order was not freshly made, my pizza looked like it has been sitting in its box for literally hours, the boneless wings were cold and the bread sticks were hard as rocks.  When I called to complain, I was told my new order would take close to an hour to make, clearly a tactic used to discourage consumers for going to get a new order.  Then I was immediately offered a credit for this order.  Honestly, if the quality of your food will be same as it was tonight, you can keep your credit. This was my first time coming to this location since I moved here to Surprise.  Unfortunately, it may very well be my last."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying I normally don't frequent Domino's, but my wife likes it. I bought two Feast pizzas, a Deluxe, and a Pepperoni for carry out. $36. Both were greasy, and under cooked. Crust was very thin and soggy, more steamed than baked, like a tortilla! My wife had to roll hers up to it eat. Like wet spaghetti!    When will they learn it takes time in the oven to bake a pizza.You cannot make and bake a pizza and in under 15 minutes."}
{"text":"I received a call from the manager at the Mesa Drive and Southern location. Now this was not the store I ordered the horrible pizza from. Dustin the manager reimbursed the money I spent, and had a new pizza delivered to me a week after the incident. He made the pizza for me and it was tasty. Wish the manager from the Val Vista and Warner location would of went above and beyond. I was impressed with the customer service Dustin provided me. He changed my negative perception to a positive. Went above and beyond to satisfy me. I still think Dominios needs to up their game with pizza a bit. I'm not a fan of the sauce. This pizza was far better than the prior two sent from the Gilbert location. I would order from this Mesa location only if Dustin is working, and can actually make the pizza. Thanks Dominios for reaching out and rectifying the situation."}
{"text":"I remember the old 30 minutes or less back in the day.  The pizza was cheap and without soul.  Man!  How things have changed.  Wanting a pie, I hopped on the computer and ordered online.  Lots of deals online, I would recommend purchasing from here.  You can also track the production of your order from order to finish.  When the pizza arrived in under thirty minutes, I asked the delivery guy if they still had the 30 minutes or less policy.  He said they did not.....impressive!  Pur order consisted of a tasty two topper.  Everything tasted fresh and the crust was seasoned and not tasting like cardboard as I had previously remembered.  Dominio's has this thing they do with the chicken bites where they throw some toppings on them.  I ordered the tomato and bacon.  They were were delicious.  Having been a fan of the other pepperoni and dough tossing corporate giant, it's nice to have another pepperoni, dough tossing corporate giant to buy from."}
{"text":"They always show up missing at least half of my order. The woman manager wasn't helpful at all and just pawned me off to the General Manager, Mike. This has happened over 3 times in the past month. DONT ORDER FROM HERE!!!"}
{"text":"This domino's use to be my favorite one and even though I was not able to get deliveries from them I would always order carry out.After my last experience with them, I will not longer be getting Domino's from this location. I tried calling the establishment and my call was never answered. After I place my order and get it I see that the staff  is rude and did not take my orders correctly. When I told them it was not right they refused to help and just went about their business. They pizza toppings were wrong the there wasn't prepared correctly. It felt like there wasn't enough sauce.  I strongly suggest to STAY away from this location. Maybe try Pizza Hut."}
{"text":"They must have trained the staff. Ended up trying it twice recently and things are much improved. Got the order correct both times."}
{"text":"I ordered from the website for this location.  Luckily enough it also gives you a tracker to tell you where your pizza is in the process.  Unfortunately for them it showed me that the pizza was out of the oven and sitting in the store for about 30 minutes before it even left with the delivery driver.  I don't mind waiting for pizza, but I do not expect it to be 40 minutes old by the time it gets to me.  On top of that I complained and was told that they would give 2 LG free on my next order and the credit was on my account (ph#) wouldn't you know.... I call and nothing was there no credit, no nothing.  Lucky for me that there lots of other choices for good pizza in the area."}
{"text":"So today I ordered 2 pizzas for $5.99 each and pasta. The online ordering process was fine the delivery guy was polite and the order got here faster than last time I ordered. I open up the pizza boxes and one pizza was cut/ sliced as it should be and the other one was not. Now I can cut the pizza myself but that's not what I paid for. I also order on a regular basis and this has never happened. How did this pizza pass quality check?  Mind you I only ordered 2 pizzas not 20 for a party. Can you imagine ordering 20 pizzas and only half of them being cut/sliced? Now on a positive note they did call me and gave me a credit for the next time I order and apologized for the mess up."}
{"text":"Let me tell you something about this Dominos: They bring you pizza every single time you try to get them to do that. It's very quick and the guy shows up holding pizza. You sign a little piece of paper, then you get to take the pizza, and then you eat it by putting it in your mouth and chewing it. You also have to swallow, but I can't explain how to do that - it just sortof happens. Like just put the pizza in there and see how it goes and I bet it works out."}
{"text":"The food we got tonight was laughable. It was actually worse than frozen food... Because I know how to work an oven. Specialty loaded bbq bites- burned. Typically candied with bbq, it was burned to a crisp and dry. Philly cheese pizza was as dry as the desert sand. It's so over cooked that it was too dry to eat just 30 min after pick up. It was hard as a rock, seriously. Bummer."}
{"text":"Order a pizza for family movie night on a Saturday. I have a 17th month old and 10 year old, mind you the 17th month old is hungry and wants his food. I was told 45 to 55 minutes which i assumed being a Saturday night maybe a few minutes longer. Our pizza showed up after 120 minutes, double the time I was told.  Pizza was seriously cold to the point the cheese just broke when you separated it. No warmpth or gooeyness. It felt as if it was room temp after a long night of sitting out.  I called and spoke to the very nice manager who said if we wanted another pizza it would be about an hour, if not we can get a credit; however my 17 month old was screaming for food and I had to feed him. So the kids ate their cold pizza but an hour and 10 minutes later we got our hot and delicious food! Thank you to the Domino's on couloak dr. You redeemed yourself although using the excuse your DXP made it busier than thought is no excuse.                               Sincerely, a customer who will try again"}
{"text":"These guys decide daily to close at a different time despite what the sign says in the front of the store. Long time customer and I will be taking my business elsewhere, after dealing with this issue several times. I shouldn't have to deal with attitude from and employee when the get caught doing something they shouldn't. Absolutely terrible display of customer service. Apparently the manager of this location doesn't give a shit so don't waste your time, there are plenty of better pizza places around the neighbourhood.    guys, you fucked up"}
{"text":"Placed order online. Loved watching the status!! It arrived as promised...it was correct and arrived HOT!!  Love this option when I just do not feel like cooking (or going out)! Thanks Domino's!"}
{"text":"This place is a joke! It's been 2.5 hours and still no pizza! Chelsea keeps giving us the run around!"}
{"text":"I'm a fan of Dominos Pizza ever since I tried their Philly Cheesesteak Pizza. I love their online ordering system where they even provide you with a tracker that tracks to keep you up-to-date on your pizza order. They never disappoint and the pizza is always hot and fresh when I go pick it up. It's great how I do not have to wait at all every time I come and just pay and leave right away.  The only downside is that the plaza is always busy and parking is a pain at times."}
{"text":"I'm a fan of the online ordering, the pizza could go a little in the flavor department.  Being able to track the pizza in all stages of being made was interesting."}
{"text":"Always hot and very fast service. Amazing Gluten Free pizza!  Delivery people are nice"}
{"text":"I've ordered from this location 5 times I think. Twice they delivered the wrong order and one other time the delivery was so late that the meal became irrelevant."}
{"text":"management is non-existant.  had to wait over an hour and a half for my order.  utterly poor representation of dominos.  avoid at all costs"}
{"text":"I've had mixed results from this location. The food is usually right with at least one caveat each time.  Recently, our order included cinnamon sticks, which I thought probably aren't supposed to have powdered cheese and herbs on them...   One of the pizzas was cut by someone who may have been having a stroke. The senseless disregard for straight lines doesn't bother me as much as Domino's disregard for the health of their workers. (I joke, but seriously, what's with the hexagonal pieces?)  The delivery guy forgot the receipt I was to sign, and tried to get me to sign on a sticker. He said that he'd get it, but he never came back.  Strange happenings."}
{"text":"I ordered an entire pizza, and received a sandwich. What?? Cheap, and NOT the tastiest pizza place anyway. Only go here if it's your last option."}
{"text":"The pizza was hot, good and quick.  We ordered some pizzas after a night of trick or treating.  They have made great improvements on their pizzas.  I think their pizza is one of the best for the big three now.  If you have a group of people that you need to feed fast.  Call Dominos."}
{"text":"Got exactly what I asked for And what i expected : it's not a pizzeria but ironically it's better than many of them out here  Timely, polite??? they didn't have the new dominos-mobile yet..  They always seem to have some good coupons to justify not cooking. Have them cook to well done and then EAT IT COLD! Much better personally speaking"}
{"text":"This Domino's has provided some of the best pizza I have ever had.  And I have had sone RENOWNED pizza. (NYC deep dish to LA surf style).  People should awaken to how good a chain can be. Listen to their ads. They really have improved. GET THE BROOKLYN SPECIAL! Guaranteed enjoyment."}
{"text":"Takes too long to get. This kind of pizza shouldn't take an hour and fifteen minutes. Tried three times and same wait. Food good and hot but wait is too long"}
{"text":"Ordered for a pizza and was given a 45 minute estimate for delivery.  After an hour called and was told the driver was out and should be there within 5-10 minutes.  Called back 30 minutes later and was told they were calling the driver and would handle within 10 minutes and call me back.  25 minutes later we left to get food somewhere else.  Ridiculous."}
{"text":"I never once had a problem here out of the 4 years I've been coming. I'm not sure why  this place doesn't even have 3 stars."}
{"text":"Apparently no one is able to really take down my CC number correctly.  When I used the word \"honey\", I was hung up on.  I went into the store to order a take out pizza only to be \"greeted\" by this same \"honey\" Don't call the millineal  with the horned rimmed glasses \"honey\" ever!  She doesn't feel safe.  She will seek a safe place behind the counter and call the police."}
{"text":"Always order online from here. I live nearby and cooking usually takes about 25 min. and delivery another 10. Last time it took 20 and 50 :s Also, the last two times, they messed up my order. I WANT EXTRA *!#@%^) MARINARA SAUCE, not that regular tomato crap."}
{"text":"Horrible customer service. They got my order wrong and blamed me for it and refused to make it right. Just because they're the only Dominoes in town doesn't mean they can treat their customers like this. Never eating from them again."}
{"text":"I always get super fast food when ordering in store for carry our. Mostly everything from wing/, sandwiches, pizzas, and pasta are all done before 15 minutes. The staff here are really friendly and they deserve a hand for being so fast when they get super rushed."}
{"text":"Solid 4 stars! The pizza almost always comes within 30 mins. Tonight when we ordered, it took almost an hour before the driver showed up. Juan was very apologetic for the wait and told us if anything was wrong with the pizza to call the store and they would immediately fix it! Nothing was wrong, the pizza was hot and yummy like always!'"}
{"text":"I know, I know, this is not the healthiest pizza place in the area but it's so good and convenient! Even though I live around the area I always have it delivered because I can and I'm lazy sometimes. My favorite is a medium pizza with pepperoni and black olives with some Parmesan bites and boneless chicken with ranch sauce. Might feel expensive but I can save it for the day after! Isn't that great? Anyway, I don't leave a 5-star rating because a few months ago we lost our Monday-only 50% off coupon on the whole order. I'm sad but my wallet thanks you for this move and I'm still ordering from time to time especially since we can a free pizza once we order six times. Smart moves you pizza maker :)"}
{"text":"I order very often from the jones location and they are very fast and accurate. I would totally recommend this dominos I get everything right away and hot"}
{"text":"Not a big fan of Dominos, but decided to try them again since the special was going to save me some money. My simple pizza, with only diced tomatoes and sausage was okay except that it tasted heavily salted. The pasta dish was not for me, with its \"bowl\" made of what could be thick crust of pizza dough. No way am I adding this to my diet. The enclosed macaroni with tomato sauce and chicken was good, but not worth the cost. Delivery was fast, employee polite and hunger satisfied."}
{"text":"I ordered a pizza from this location and was disappointed to find that the pizza was thin crust, when that was not what I had ordered or wanted. Staff didn't do anything when I called later with the complaint."}
{"text":"We just moved to this area and are so pleased to have a competent Dominoes right around the corner from us. They are always so friendly and the order is always perfectly made. Great amount of toppings and the crusts are always cooked perfectly. Sometimes there's a wait, but it's worth it."}
{"text":"We go back and forth with this place.  Sometimes good and sometimes bad.  Today we ordered the new pan pizza. It sounds good. When it arrived the pizza tasted like the box smelled. The new black box stinks. The pizza was not edible.  We called and they said that they would send another pizza.    Not a fan of this new box."}
{"text":"I typically don't like chain pizza but this place always makes the best pizzas and their delivery service, no matter who it is, are always top notch, professional, it gets delivered on time and always warm.  Great group of people here.  Kudos to them ALL!!!"}
{"text":"worst website for orders ever! process does not show \"pan\"  when the two-fer coupon is used. that up-sells by $2 per item which negates the coupon. giving them one more try was a mistake. won't happen again, ever! back to anyone else."}
{"text":"Called this place multiple times about 11pm. The guy answers the phone and puts me on hold for 15 minutes. I hang up and called back and I get out on hold again. This has happened multiple times it is very annoying and truly unacceptable. Horrible customer service!!!!"}
{"text":"More than one hour and still no pizza.  Called store let them know tracker says it's been out of oven for 40 minutes but still not here.  Response was \"oh the tracker doesn't know how busy we are. It really is accurate   I'm sure it will be there in the next 15 minutes. \"  Will be almost 90 minutes of it takes 15 more minutes.   Could have made my own in the time this has taken.   Maybe time to find a new delivery place."}
{"text":"Hard cheese bites more sauce than cheese and mushrooms just horrible tired of ordering from here they need to hire better cooks!!! Ordered from here three times and I'm done"}
{"text":"Called a competitor at 9:55pm and they said they were closed. Their website says open until 10:00pm. So I logged onto Dominos website. Ordered. Watched status online from prep to delivery. Lets just say the \"hut\" no longer has any of my business and I am LOVING Dominos. Pizza was perfect. NICE!"}
{"text":"Service is terrible. 1st there were customers in line 14 minutes who were ignored. A female customer shows up and amazingly instant attention. And then I am told my order would take 30+ minutes. Waste of time very unusual for Dominos to treat customers this poorly."}
{"text":"Not sure if he was the manager, his name started with a B. But they had wonderful customer service. Was quick, attentive, had a great smile on his face and the food was right there for me to take when I ordered online. Very pleased with the Dominos on 67th ave and Glendale. Keep it up guys!"}
{"text":"HALF STAR!!! I had gotten a delivery, once it arrived I was shocked to see a flat \"pan pizza\" instead of handmade pan pizza! It's my favorite pizza to order on the count of I love the bread, but in this case I got gooey uncooked mess. When I called back to tell them what was wrong Maritza told me that it could be flat as long as it was in a pan...huh? I told her I order here and normally get thick bread with air pockets she said she made my order and she can send another but it's going to be just the same..I refuse. Terrible customer service as well as terrible pizza quality!!!"}
{"text":"Oh My!! whata bad pizza pie!!  Ordered for delivery. Delivered cold. paid $18 for a medium pizza. Not again!"}
{"text":"The pizza came well cooked and hot. The only thing is that the crust was slightly burned, and the garlic was barely on the crust. But overall the delivery service was fast and friendly, and the pizza was good."}
{"text":"I'm glad to have Domino's in the neighborhood now. It was the only pizza place missing in this area as we have all the other pizza chains nearby. They took over a vacant building in the Albertsons shopping center and I love watching new things open up there as I have lived in this neighborhood for several years now and seen a lot of businesses come and go.   The service is always fast and friendly. This particular Domino's is always super clean. Plus, it's hard not to like Domino's because if you don't want to wait, you don't have to. Just order through the phone or even better, order through their app and the Domino's Tracker will keep you updated on the status of your order so you are not waiting aimlessly in the store. They also have a tablet where you can check in to just click on your name, which streamlines the process even more. They've always got my order correct and it's piping hot and fresh. It can get a little pricey at times, but if there's a good deal going on, I will try to pop over there."}
{"text":"Ah, what's a guy to do when he wants pizza on Thanksgiving?  What, you say? Domino's is open? And you can order and track the pizza online? I'm in! They were (honestly) the sixth pizza place I called this afternoon when I realized that I was hungry and and the grocery wasn't even open. So they definitely get props for that. I got the two medium two toppings deal for $12. The pizzas were a bit late on arrival, but only about 10 minutes later than they estimated. They actually tasted a bit better than I thought they would (particularly after reading some abysmal reviews here). I would (and probably will) order from them again sometime."}
{"text":"Staying at the Fairfield hotel had two pizzas and some hot wings delivered all good we'll still warm when I got here the delivery guy was very nice"}
{"text":"1.3/5 stars - Almost so bad I can't eat it. The hand tossed pizza is about 25% edge, 50% air bubble and 25% soggy mess. Sauce tastes like catsup and the toppings always taste like they are frost bitten. The thin crust Philly cheesesteak pizza is surprisingly good, but it only comes around once in a while."}
{"text":"Well here it is the 5-20-16 and domino's has yet to return my money. I have already filed a complaint with corporate, I'm gonna make contact again on Monday morning. I will never use the company ever again and will put the word out on social media. The paper trail had started and I'm keeping records dates and times and who I spoke with. My next complaint will go to the BBB, then the federal trade commission."}
{"text":"Great pizza that comes to your door for a fair price.  I just don't like the fact that there is a delivery charge and you need to tip . . .  pick one lol otherwise there are a lot of great local pizza joints but If the temperature drops to below 15 or 20 and you have no interest in going outside this onenis for you.  You can order online or on the app which is great because I hate ordering over the phone and it makes it easier when ordering in groups.    Bottom line its dominos ..  Its pretty good but I'd your not lazy you can get better."}
{"text":"I've never had a problem with this place - not when I've ordered online, not when I've ordered on the phone, not when I've called an order in, not when I've done carryout, and not when I've done delivery.  Good pizza. Get a coupon and you can get a good deal."}
{"text":"Quick and easy dinner!  We ordered online and our pizza was ready right on time.  The service is great at this location.  We ordered thin crust sausage, garlic and mushroom. The pizza was great for the price!"}
{"text":"Terrible. The store is not far from our house. The pizza showed up fairly quickly, so why was it barely warm when it showed up? I think because it was made hours earlier and reheated. I've ordered from Domino's before from other locations, and it was really good. I'll never order it when I'm at home again because I know it'll come from this store. Head office should pull the plug on this store."}
{"text":"We ordered pizza on our lunch today and we were very disappointed when we received the pizzas. It was burned, messy and dry. We called back to get our money back. Never order from here again."}
{"text":"Went to the store to order a deep dish pizza with pepperoni/sausage on one side and ham/pineapple on the other side. The guy kept getting the order wrong and I had to correct him two times and finally someone came over to help. When I got home I found that they sliced the pizza into 16 slices with each one being less than 2 inches wide. Pizza tasted good but I will not be using this location again."}
{"text":"Waited over 1 hour for pizza to be delivered...promised in 38 minutes via website.   Called the store concerned about the delay and was told that \"this the way it is and if arrived not hot, order another\"....that means we 'll wait another hour. Arrived like warm....never again will we order a Dominoes Pizza."}
{"text":"Dominos pizza is pretty good, but the Lakewood, OH location has terrible service. When I went in for pick-up, I was ignored because they had so many deliveries. Then, when I went to pay, the cashier kept my change. That was awkward. Most recently, I got an e-mail for 20% off entire order with online delivery (the headline said \"we miss you!\") So of course there's an error message prompting us to call the restaurant, where ultimately our order went from $40 to $49, after the manager explained they were out of pineapples and would not honor our coupon (after their worker said they would). We ended up cancelling our order and going to another local pizza place. Dominos as a whole has done a great job of improving their menu and recipes, but my local spot is too disappointing to try again."}
{"text":"Soooo, we had a holiday party to attend 12/10/16. We were staying at the JW Marriott at Desert Ridge and had our kids in the room while we partied. Decided to Google Map and see where we could order. Unluckily, this Dominoes location was the closest. Called and placed and order with Adam. He took the Hotel number and our room number. He advised our pizzas would be delivered in 20-30 minutes. 45 minutes later I called to check on our pizzas as they hadn't arrived. Adam sounded confused and asked me to hold. He brought 'the manager\" on the phone who was very rude and condescending. Saying my pizza had been left at the front desk as no one by our name was staying at the hotel. I asked if they had used the room number we left initially. She declined to answer any of my questions and attempted to over talk me. After she saw that I wouldn't be over talked, especially since I had already paid for a pizza that was NEVER delivered to me, she hung up on me. I called the front desk of this VERY NICE RESORT and was advised that there was no pizza left at the front desk. I immediately called back, Adam answered again. I asked to speak to his manager. He knew EXACTLY who I was when he called Maddie to the phone. I told her I was on my way and to have my pizzas ready. I arrived within 10 minutes to be greeted by Haley who says it was her rude ass over the phone and that she didn't lie. The real Maddie intervened and vehemently apologized for her rude ass, customer service lacking employee, Haley. Although I appreciate Maddie's attempt, the inconvenience I experienced wont be forgotten. Haley and Adam have screwed up for Dominoes. You will never get ANYMORE of my hard earned money for shit service."}
{"text":"This pizza place is good for their pizza however I feel like it takes FOREVER for a delivery. What happened to 30 mins or less?? I use the Pizza app on my phone and they always tell me estimate time is 45-60 mins!??! Why does it take so long.   I decided to go into the actual pizza joint to see why it was (supposedly) taking so long.   1. Their phones are ALWAYS ringing... 2.  Only one person at the counter answering them (if you are lucky to not get put on hold) 3. Not enough workers  Maybe they were short handed that day...but I do still enjoy their pizza. Not a fan of the customer service."}
{"text":"I am currently sitting in labor and delivery at Sunrise hospital, the food here is awful and was happy to know i could have food delivered to my room. I called this store to order something quick.. the kid that answered was so dry and unwelcoming (despite the fact this store did not deliver to my location), his attitude made my not even want to spend my money there. I immediately called back, asking to speak with the manager, and no named employee quickly reminded me they do not delivered to my location, I repeated myself and asked to speak to the manager.   A very polite Melissa picked up the line, i let her know of the situation and did not appreciate the employees attitude both times when i called. She said she was covering from another store and did not know the kid's name, but she would be sure to have a talk with him.   When dealing with a company that i have plans to give my money to; a little decorum and customer service should not be too much to ask for."}
{"text":"The delivery was over an hour, when I was quoted 23-33 mins. The pizza itself was cold. This is the first time I've ordered dominoes in a long time and I will definitely not be ordering again.   Just gross."}
{"text":"I must say , they have totally changed there are ingredients, and  delivers a a very delicious pizza. The premium is amazing! And and price with the cross also."}
{"text":"I love love love this Domino's!  I order the Philly sandwich and it is awesome! Always fast delivery and great service. I'm picky but this place rocks! I'm also in my 50's so I have had my share of takeout!"}
{"text":"This is one of the better Domino's locations I've encountered.  I usually call in for pick up and am quoted ten to fifteen minutes in regard to the time needed to prepare my order.  My order has always been ready by the time I arrive.  The boneless wings are great and the pizza always comes out hot.  The store is clean, the staff is friendly, and there is ample parking as it is part of a small shopping plaza.  Their customer service is solid and they usually answer the phone right away after the automated message is completed.  I've never had a bad experience with this store!"}
{"text":"Good pizza was made well done like I asked the pizza tracker was pretty accurate when it told me to leave wings were super soggy which was expected and the cheesy bread was meh staff was friendly and location was very clean I would order here again for sure"}
{"text":"Ok Dominos we called to have pizza delivered to our house to our kids. You have been here many times and now all of the sudden your help can't find us on the map. Then they say oh we redistricted our area. Well who delivers the 10000 houses across the st. We wentand had pappas John's deliver to us. Get some help that knows what they are doing? You will not last long like that. Guess we from know on will call the hut or pappas.This is the second d time we have had problems with this particular franchise."}
{"text":"I knew I shouldn't have called. The absolute worst phone order experience ever. The guy on the phone was dumb as box of rocks. Never again...."}
{"text":"Unbelieveably rude I ordered a pizza to the flamingo and yeah it's not my first time ordering a pizza to a hotel. We waited outside for 25 minutes and never saw anyone. They took the order back to the store and were very rude to me on the phone. Save your time and just eat whatever pizza is at the hotel."}
{"text":"I go to Dominos Pizza on Trop and Pecos every Friday, but who ever that is answering the phone and taking orders SUCKS!!! I was so upset last time call her back and told her just cancel my order. From there I did not go back  for more then a month. I recently called last Saturday after Christmas shopping and I think the same girl answered GRRRRR. I was very nice to her, but her attitude was like a hormonal teenager in HEAT! Freaking BITCHY ! So now I will take my business else until she is gone. So sad because the Manager that I would always see there was AWESOME!  Parents teach your kids some manners before they end up unemployed because they don't know how to be polite."}
{"text":"Absolutely terrible service! Sat on hold for nearly 10 minutes... heard them lift the phone up, put me back on hold without saying darn thing. I don't care if you are 15 minutes to close. I was calling in simply to place an order. Completely unacceptable."}
{"text":"Consistently a good pizza. Their new recipe is way better than the old days. Always affordable and delivery is over super quick. We get the same delivery guy often and he is always super nice. The new app is honestly the best app around."}
{"text":"Pizza was cold, cheese coagulated.  Ordered online and watched our pizza, per online tracking, sit for 20 minutes before the start of delivery. I live 6 minutes from the store location. It took another 25 minutes for delivery. Very disappointed. We have had one issue, ever, in the 30+ orders from this location. The first was never rectified, as I was told I would receive credit for my undercooked pizzas (×2) upon my next purchase. This is inexcusable."}
{"text":"Best Customer Service I've ever recieved. They are very helpful and friendly. Delivery is always fast and arrives with my hot pizza."}
{"text":"I went in to their location which is right next door to where I moved and ordered a pizza and it was a very tasty pizza.   They even walked it over here to my location which they didn't have to do so great customer service."}
{"text":"I was initially going to be kinder in my review of the N. Jones and Charleston DOMINOS due to the fact that they were incredibly swamped when I walked in- there was at least 12 staff at the time (Friday the 15th at 6 P.M. ) and all were running about. That should have indicated competency- but no. Only two people were waiting for orders- the rest were phone- and I placed a simple order for an XL Hawaiian with olive and onion. Simple. I waited 40 minutes as people were served ahead of me- walk-ins and pick-ups. Finally, an employee called my name and handed me the pizza. Not wanting to lose the heat, I waited until I had returned home to open it. What a disappointment. You couldn't tell if there was pineapple at all, and the cheese was dark dingy and brown, not the lively colorful yellow and white of a well made Hawaiian. I will NOT be returning to DOMINOS again. Even LITTLE CAESARS is better than this crap. In Las Vegas, there are hundreds of better Pizza shops- competition should be fierce -- but I guess if you are a National Chain, you can ignore the rubes at your pleasure. Here's to you, Dominos !! P.S. I noticed the wide variations of reviews on here- they veer from 5 stars to 1 with little in-between. For all you surfers out there, it's impossible for a business to be Bi-Polar in it's daily services- it would quickly go bankrupt. But on the internet, with the push of a button, you can raise your rating and make your pizza place look gooood. So all those +5 glowing reviews??.....I am positive that 99 percent of them are - wait for it - FAKE REVIEWS by friends and family of our local DOMINOS. It's the only way such spiky reviews can be possible. So while they lurch along like some sauce and cheese built frankenstonian monster, the innocent and gullible will be victimized again and again and again..........."}
{"text":"Well they got us. Damn those commercials.   My friends and I were starving and looking for something quick and cheap. And what do you know, a Domino's commercial came on....and it was a wrap.  Now, I've never really been a big fan of Domino's I didn't like the sauce, or crust and after a while I just kinda stopped trying and ordering. So, I won't lie initially I was not a happy camper. But when my friends suggested we skip the traditional red sauce and order white sauce I was a little more optimistic.   We ordered the special two medium two topping pizzas for $5.99 each. The first pie had ham and feta cheese with white sauce and the second was their Philly cheese steak and banana peppers with of course their white sauce.   Welp, here's my moment of shame. I actually liked both pizzas.   Between the white sauce and the hint of garlic in their crust I found myself wanting to eat more and more. My favorite was the Philly cheese steak. It seemed like a weird combination at the time but it was actually really good...tasty flavors and those banana peppers just put it over the top.   So for now, they get an A-OK in my book. I'll give them another try and see if they can't officially win me over."}
{"text":"Horrible experience! The manager Kylie at this location is a liar and very rude. After she threw our pizza away (apparently we took to long to pick it up) she made us another order within minutes. Well when we got home the order was wrong so we called to complain and she stated she would give us credit. ONLY Four days later being that my nieces and nephews were here I decided to use that credit. Well what do you know she remembers us, but doesn't recall talking to us about our order being wrong or giving us credit for the mishap lol... (really it's been 4 days)! Sorry but it's $12 for 2 large pizzas being that they have their 5.99 special. I'm not going to call and lie about a credit for $12 lol... So do yourself a favor and get your money back if your order is wrong or just avoid this location. She shouldn't be managing a facility if she can't even do her job correctly."}
{"text":"Say what you will about national pizza chains but I always enjoy Dominos Pizza.    Located on the corner of Paseo Verde and Stephanie, it's easy to find with plenty of parking.  I usually order delivery since it's convenient.  They have always arrived in the time stated on my online order.  The drivers have always been friendly as well.    For our usual order we choose the hand made pan.  The crust is delicious and not as greasy as the competition.  Toppings have always been plentiful and tasty.    As for their breadsticks or stuffed cheesy bread, I'd rather skip it.  The stuffed bread we've received had been very greasy with not too many toppings stuffed inside.    I've also tried a few different sandwiches they offer.  The philly cheese steak and chicken bacon ranch is tasty.  When you order 2 they are only 5.99.  Not too shabby.    I do enjoy it and since they make it really easy to order online, I'm sure I will again soon."}
{"text":"I love Domino's in general but this location will never have our business again because the manager doesn't know how to treat customers.  I placed an order today for lunch and received a confirmation. I waited 40 minutes before calling to ask where the food was and was told someone had called and cancelled my order. Huh? When I told the guy that this obviously this was a mistake on their end, he said he'd have to speak to his manager. When the manager got on the phone, he barks, \"What's the problem\" and I told him my problem was that they somehow cancelled my order without notifying me (even though I get a confirmation that the order was placed) and now it's nearly an hour later with no food so a discount, like a free brownie ($3) would be nice. He tells me he can't do that. I told him he's going to lose the order and me as a customer if he doesn't. He didn't budge so I hope it was worth it. $3 brownies versus a $30 order...SERIOUSLY?? Horrible customer service."}
{"text":"This is the only place that delivers in the area. So I'll probably continue ordering, but it seems every time that my order is sub par. I've followed the order status app to keep watch when it's ready, but it's never right. Every single time it says it's already delivered and I'm waiting another 45 minutes at least. Never order from here if you're hungry. And stick with normal type things. I've tried new menu things a few times now and they arrive burnt. Parmesan bites arrived dark brown and crispy and the chicken arrived black. Just stick with a pizza with your favorite toppings, and don't order double or triple on any of them. They somehow miss that."}
{"text":"I LOVE this location. I order through my app very often from work. Always very fast and friendly. Just today was the ONLY time they have ever messed up my order. And if anything they OVER-compensated, and offered free food and also let me keep the food they brought originally. And apologized non stop. Always have a good experience with this location and am beyond satisfied! Keep it up"}
{"text":"Sooooooo, this is the 2nd time we ordered from this particular Dominos. The first time we ordered, they screwed up our pizza, so when I called and spoke with the manager, she put a \"free large 3 topping pizza\" on the account for next time. Ok, fine.  We call tonight to order that free pizza and we added an order of wings to that for delivery. That was at 4:45pm...5:30 comes and goes, no pizza. Not a huge deal considering the game was on...6:15 comes and we finally call to see what happened.  This is the conversation I had with the person on the phone when I called:  Me: Hi, we ordered a pizza at 4:45 and we were wondering what happened to our order... (gave him order/address specifics)  Dominos: Well, there is no record of your order.  Me: You're kidding, right?!  Dominos: Nope.  Me: Well, I called an hour and a half ago and the guy on the phone took the order and actually confirmed it with me.... (I got interrupted...)  Dominos: Well, I'm the manager and I've been here ALL DAY and there is no order for you. (I'd like to add that he had the most ridiculous attitude towards me)  Me: Wow, you're the manager and you speak to customers like that?!  Dominos: Yeah.  I asked him his first and last name and I would have preferred screaming obscenities at him, but I just hung up and went to Barros which is basically 80000% better anyway.  We just wanted to use the free pizza we were \"given\" because they effed our order up the first time.   Shoulda learned the first time, huh?  I will NEVVVVVVVVVER go back here, and I'd suggest that anybody that appreciates to be treated the way a customer deserves to be treated doesn't either."}
{"text":"Food usually arrives hot but it is almost always much later than estimated delivery time given from online ordering and the tracker cannot be trusted at all.  We have called before and they admit to not using the tracker tool properly."}
{"text":"They don't allow for online ordering and did not pick up the phone when I called in the order. Either they are shut down or they are the worst Domino's Pizza I have ever encountered."}
{"text":"This store royally screwed up our order last night, but the management was gracious and handled the mishap immediately and efficiently.  Food was hot and wonderful once delivered.  If all mistakes are handled in this manner,  the manager deserves a gold star and a raise."}
{"text":"We always order pizza and wings from this location, but we just got our pizza and the bottom was completely undercooked. You can taste the raw dough. This is not the first bad experience with this particular dominos, usually it takes over an hour to get our food. I'm disappointed and won't be ordering from them again"}
{"text":"This location continually neglects to include sauces that were ordered. The have also messed up or undercooked my pizza on multiple occasions. I will not be ordering from this location again and recommend that you don't either."}
{"text":"The service was fantastic but my order was very lackluster. I ordered wings due to the hoopla they're making over the new recipe. The skin was soggy due to it being over-sauced or maybe that's just an error on the part of it being cooked. Since there was so much sauce I couldn't taste the \"new recipe\". I guess Domino's still hasn't gotten it right on their wings or it's just this Domino's."}
{"text":"Stay Away!! Very frustrating experience!  Waited two hours and multiple phone calls to them to find out where my order was.  No good explanation. Never got my order delivered."}
{"text":"Pizza took forever to arrive - again. Promised a free pizza in my phone number - again - (free pizza credit doesn't exist.) And someone awful, named Raji yelled at me when I called to check my food's progress."}
{"text":"If your into frozen, processed pizza then you'll like Dominos. Better quality than Little Caesars, which also uses frozen dough."}
{"text":"This place is horrible! I ended up waiting for 20 mins after I called it in 30mins before.  I get there and the name was completely  wrong, the pizza is over seasoned and the employees seem miserable.  Can't expect to much I guess from a Domino's..."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch the other day   Pros  Great service  Well priced (thin crust medium pizza $5) Good seating   Cons None that come to mind"}
{"text":"My ultimate Go-To if I'm feeling lazy and don't want to cook dinner. Try ordering a pizza with white sauce, chicken and parmesan-asiago topping. Delivery is fast and you can order online with coupons! The delivery people are always super friendly."}
{"text":"I usually try to stay local with everything I eat, but local doesn't deliver until 3:30am when I'm schwilly on the weekends.  Love the 2 @ $5.99 deal. Mix and match hot sandwiches, wings, pizzas and more.  After tax, delivery charge, and $5 tip to the driver it's about $20 to have a much improved Domino's pizza at your doorstep.  Worry about this late night bad decision another time. You only live once!"}
{"text":"muy mal servicio ordene por Línea dure más de 1 hora y 30 min nunca llegó mi orden y tuve que proceder a cancelar muy mal servicio por parte de todo ese equipo de trabadores"}
{"text":"We used to love dominos! Unfortunately, I feel its gone downhill. Maybe adding cheese or baking the pizza more wouldn't hurt? Our pizzas tonight were awful"}
{"text":"Apparantly after 10 years I've been removed from the delivery zone and told that they have never delivered to me because they have no delivery history. Hmmmm.... I've got 10 years of order history from this store but they have never delivered to me. Never, Never, Never go to this store if you can help it. HORRIBLE customer service!!"}
{"text":"This is a wonderful establishment with fantastic employees. I've never had a wrong order and they back their device."}
{"text":"I received an offer by email from Dominos over the weekend.  The offer was alright and seemed like a decent deal so I ordered not only 1 but 2 pizzas from the Domino's located at 35th ave and Peoria.  The offer was for carryout/pickup only so okay no problem I will go there to get it.  I ordered online and went to pick it up.  They had my pizzas ready and I went to pay the employee and he asked me if I wanted any peppers etc.  I said yes I would like some of the peppers. And he said that they charge for the peppers something like a 1.25 I think is what he said.  Usually the peppers come in the little packets and are usually free along with parmesan cheese, napkins, paper plates etc. at any place you order pizza from.  I was angry and disgruntled that Domino's pizza is charging for this now.  Especially when I just spent over $20.00 for pizzas that I had to go to pick up.  What is next Domino's?  What if I had to use the bathroom there? Would you charge me for toilet paper? The soap and water I used to wash my hands?  There is such a thing as a cost of doing business and keeping customers happy.  Please look at this cost and decide if it is worth upsetting people and getting a bad review because you wanted to charge a customer for peppers that any other place gives you for free if you order pizza from them.  Because of this I will no longer order from Domino's, I will tell friends, family, colleagues and everyone that Domino's charges for crushed red peppers."}
{"text":"This place lost a star for their ridiculously limited delivery area. I live 1.2mi away and they won't deliver. I really don't see why, just add an extra dollar to the delivery charge. Ohio City problems.   Anyway I ordered online with a coupon I was sent via email. It was SO cheap for so much food. You can track the progress online. So we saw that it said : \"Abigail put it in the oven\". Lol cool. Then less then 10mins later it was done?! I thought no way. So I went down there, sure enough it was all waiting for us! Thanks Abigail ;). We had a great girls night.  1 medium pizza+Parmesan bites (really good!) + cinnasticks =$10.00!!!  Abigail needs to put a tip jar on that counter!"}
{"text":"Order from ANYWHERE else but here. Seriously! Especially if you're thinking about ordering delivery.   Weekdays - 2+ hours.  Weekends - worse.  If you're starving real bad, can't think straight, hear your stomach making noises you haven't heard before... still DO NOT order from here!"}
{"text":"i accidentally ordered a takeout instead of delivery and i was upset and unpleasant to the manager whom was nice and cooperative. i called back after confirming that i made a mistake about my order and i apologized. she was professional and very kind. i was a jackass.   go dominos!"}
{"text":"Love this location!! Website lets you custom order and they delivery quickly.Perfect for the busy school nights or a Friday evening when your too tired to cook.   Keep up the great work!!"}
{"text":"A friend of mine is obsessed with Domino's pizza so there was no convincing her otherwise when we decided to go pick up pizza.  I had never been to Domino's and I had a pretty good experience.  When we arrived, our pizza was hot, and ready for pick up. It was very well made (not disgustingly greasy), and reasonably priced. The service was great and the place wasn't busy.  This Domino's was easy to get to (located in Crowfoot Plaza) and it's near a  blockbuster, so we killed two birds with one stone!  Easy, Peasy, mmmmm Cheeeesy!"}
{"text":"Customer service here is terrible. I ordered a pizza on my way home from a 40 min drive, realizing I forgot my purse at work when I went to pick it up. No offer to look up my card number or anything so who knows what happened with the food - hopefully it did not go to waste. After about an hour and a half when I was on my way home again at 9:40, 20 min away, I called again to order, the person on the phone kept hitting buttons and telling me the disruption was on my end and in between the loud beeps, asked me if I could be there by 10 because they close their doors at 10. Needless to say, I said forget it and placed my second order at one of the MANY nearby stores that keep their doors open way past 10 pm on a Friday night. And when I drove by on my way home from driving out of my way for the second time that night around 10:30 pm, all the employees were standing around talking in the parking lot. Must have had important things to do. Won't be ordering from them again."}
{"text":"Yes, it's the place where we stop for pizza for convenience -- it's on our way home from work, it's cheap, it's simple. Do they always get our orders right? No. Do some of the staff there need a lesson or two in customer service? Absolutely. Am I going to stop going there as a result? No, it's too convenient.   So, if you're looking for a notch above a frozen pizza, go for it. If you're looking for a cheap alternative to the newly closed Little Caesars, definitely give it a try. If you're looking for your order to be perfect, or gourmet, or a friendly experience, I'd go elsewhere.  Can't beat the 2 medium sized 2-topping pizzas for $5.99 though."}
{"text":"Dominos is alright but the service here was particularly bad, stick to delivery. Kiosk to check in, fine, someone said hi so they knew I was there and checked in. Picking up carry out that I ordered 20 mins ago. Email said it'd be ready in 18 mins max. They hadn't started making it, but no one says anything to me I just see them scramble and start to make it. Starting out well. 15 min go by and my phone pings saying thanks for picking up your pizza. I wait another 5 mins and my name goes off the check in queue. Still no word and there's a line at the counter now so I know if I don't ask now I'll be stuck waiting for all these people to order. I cut the line and ask and low and behold it's ready. There were groups of people waiting that had gotten there before me as well. Pizza was barely warm. If it wasn't $6 I would have asked for my money back."}
{"text":"Boy, this place's online ordering pissed me off... not only was the website jumpy, but they never received my order.  This is the first time in 20 years that I've ordered anything from Domino's Pizza, and F- this place, I'm never ordering from them again. I went ahead and RE-placed my order, because I already tipped the driver (more than one person ordered from here), it's my f-ing lunch and I'm at work and can't leave, but sh!t, now I have to stay hungry for the entire lunch rush before they'll be able to get me my food - all because THEY didn't get the order ticket. F**kers better not charge me for the first order!!"}
{"text":"I'm not really a big fan of the \"new\" Dominos pizza. I think this is a case of old Coke and new Coke. Remember back in the day, Coke changed it's formula to be more syrupy tasting, similar to Pepsi? Then they decided it was a big mistake and went back to \"Coke Classic.\" I think same thing here applies. I had Dominos \"new\" taste today and didn't really care for the change. Behind Peter Piper Pizza, Dominos has been my 2nd favorite of the pizza chains. I liked the old taste, and I think they should bring it back. They can call it \"Dominos Classic.\"  I'm not saying I don't like the new pizza, I kind of like that strong garlic flavor to the crust. But I liked the taste of the old crust better. I never thought the old pizza tasted like \"cardboard\" like I've heard some people complain about. I think Dominos may have overreacted here to slumping sales."}
{"text":"Unfortunately this is the closest dominos to me. I should have learnt by now but they never deliver a hot pizza, the staff is rude and don't know how to treat customers and there is no consistency. This is the last time I ever order from here again.. Like if you're going to Bit*h about me while I'm placing an order atleast put yourself on mute Ian. That's why you work at a pizza joint I guess."}
{"text":"This is definitely one of the best Domino's I have ever ordered from! They offer super fast delivery and perfectly crisp and delicious thin crust pizza, the Philly Cheesesteak on thin crust will change your life!! According to their handy online tracker, I know that Shawn is usually who makes my orders, so SHOUT OUT TO SHAWN for always being on point, and consistently producing a superior pizza delivery experience :)!!"}
{"text":"Pizza was ok delivered to hotel in vegas!!!  Its dominos nothing special same pizza as always it is a national world wide chain!!"}
{"text":"We stopped ordering Dominoes after noticing that their coupon codes are a scam. Pay close attention when you put the code in, many times, while the overall order's price goes down a little, individual items' prices go up. If a business is going to offer coupon codes they shouldn't practice shady, deceptive practices. The pizza itself was ok but not great. Out of the 3 times we've ordered from Dominoes (online), we've experienced problems 2 times.   The first time, the order went through online, then no pizza almost 1.5 hours later. Calls to the store = no answer (8-10 times) and then one answer in which the individual lied and told us it was on the way. We ended up having to contact their regional management office to get the situation sorted out. They gave us a $30 credit to our account that we were hesitant to use because of the crappy service.   When we did use the coupon, the next order was ok although the pizza was definitely nothing to brag about.   The second issue that we had was when we ordered online again and had no pizza 2 hours later. We called the store and cancelled the order. Then we drove and got some Chinese food. Upon returning from getting Chinese food, a Dominos driver pulled up to our house (a total of almost 3 hours after we had ordered.) Needless to say, after our 2 bad experiences, we'll never order food from Dominos Pizza again.  *EDIT* I just saw that Dominoes' corporate offices attempted to reach out and offer $10 coupons. They're obviously somewhat engaged with their customers so I'll amend this review rating."}
{"text":"I always order via Dominos.com or via the iphone App, which is free and SO convenient.  You can set an \"easy order\" and reordering your favorite meal is easy as pie.  I love the ease of use, and the pizza tracker is awesome.  You get to know the name of the people who are touching your order as they are preparing it!  This location has never failed to show up on time for all of my delivery orders, and my order is ALWAYS 100% correct! I use the coupon online that is $5.99 for a number of different items as long as you get 2 or more.  Great deal with wonderful savings.  Food is always tasty - but then, it's Dominos, what do you expect?! :)"}
{"text":"We get delivery from this location quite often and they have been fantastic!  Pizza quality is pretty predictable and the delivery folks are very friendly. They always deliver on time even in inclement weather so \"hats off\" to them.   My favorite is Large Hand Tossed Pizza with BBQ sauce, Chicken, Jalapenos, Pineapple and Onions. Kind of twist to the Hawaiian! With a Cheesy bread, usually comes to $15 before tax and delivery ($3).   I highly recommend this place for your next fast food pizza."}
{"text":"They suck big time!!!- don't give ur biz to this store- they r rude, they put u on hold for hours - lmao"}
{"text":"Called and asked for my usual walk-in special....medium pizza with pepperoni and than I usually pay a $1 extra for the pan pizza version.  Attendant on the phone did not wish to give me that pricing even though I got it from there last time and from every other one I order from.    Don't know what the kid on the line had to gain by not giving it to me?  So I hung up and called Calabrese pizza down the road on 3019 lakeshore Blvd W.  They have a medium walk in for $6.99 and their number is 416-503-0999.  I would give it a try!"}
{"text":"Ordered online for a pick up order. Pizza was just meh... It was lacking flavor. They are pretty quick though. My order was ready in 15 mins so I'll give them one extra star for that. What's up with the wings though? They are so tiny and flavor wasn't all that great either."}
{"text":"When I went in, I was ignored at 1st, she was very rude and kept making huffing noises, she got really annoyed when I asked for my receipt and slammed it on the counter, then walked away as I was asking for peppers. She did not check the food and when I checked I saw the the cheesy bread is burnt, but I would rather just throw it away and never walk back into that Dominos again.   I sent this complaint to Dominos through there website, then recieved a call from the women who I complained about an hour later. Due to this incident I now know it is Dominos policy to have there employees call you to yell at you after you complain, I will not go back to ANY Dominos Pizza."}
{"text":"The food is always hot and fresh...the service is excellent...the only problem I have is when you order bacon on your pizza. ..they don't put enough"}
{"text":"I like this place food is always fresh and on time...but when I order bacon on my pizza.m,they give you only a little"}
{"text":"Look, there are very few options for delivery in Anthem. I ordered from every single pizza place you can order delivery from. All other pizza delivery usually takes between 1 hour and 1.5 hours. The food usually arrives cold. This Domino's is fantastic because it arrives in just under 30 minutes. It is fresh and completely hot. For all of you haters, you can specify the amount of toppings that you want on their awesome visual website. So, if you want a particular topping on your pizza you should just indicate the amount. Please order from this Domino's and enjoy a fantastic little slice of amazing. I am giving them 5 stars for being as good as Dominos possibly can get."}
{"text":"I went to this place, because I didn't want to wait for the phone to be picked up. I arrive at the store, maybe 3 customers sitting down. I went to order a  Pepperoni pizza.....was told the wait time was 50 MINUTES. Sorry Dominos As much as I love your pizza that's 7.99....I was not gonna wait an hour for a pizza.......so I went to Pieology Pizza and spent a whole 30 cents more and got a better Quality pizza.....best decision I have made regarding pizza's. Would still recommend this place......if you like long wait times......"}
{"text":"Ordered the pasta bread bowls. Got one with chicken the other mac and cheese. Chicken was raw and mushy on one and the other had no sauce and the pasta was hard. like a rock"}
{"text":"We ordered online and we feel that it's a big ripped off with the price at checkout comes out for a two toppings large pizza for $20 we tried to changed it but we cannot do it, they have a 3 toppings large for only $10.99 we called the branch to get help or cancel the order the person answers the phone is not very helpful and rude. We will not order from this place again. Don't mind paying it, but at least their people will have good manners. The only good part with this experience is that the delivery person is so nice. Big regret on our part, there is a large 2 toppings for only $7.99 at Pizza Hut. We're getting large pepperoni and pineapple for $20 at Domino's."}
{"text":"I have always ordered pizza from dominos and the delivery have been so so. I'll get my food and it'll be okay warm and okay good. That's also might be due to the fact that I always get the same stuff. But TONIGHT I got something different. I got a hot sub, bacon and ranch sub. The delivery was really fast for once but the best part was that the food was super hot. It he food was so hot that u couldn't even touch it. Never have I ever gotten delivery that was super hot.  It was SO good ;-) extremely satisfied with the service and food. Thank you."}
{"text":"This dominos is hit or miss--usually hit.  The deals are usually good, delivery is usually quick and the people are usually very friendly.  A few times, I've had the driver get lost on the way to my condo (which is pretty easy to find) and been really bad at listening to my directions as I try to help them over the phone.  Other than a few issues with delivery people my experiences have been pretty good.  Prices are good!"}
{"text":"Unfortunately, I'm not very interested in returning after dealing with the girl behind the counter.  Ordered our pizza online and used my husbands card because he was going to pick it up. Well, plans changed and I was the one that ended up going to get it, so I brought his card with me. When I first got there I stood at the front for almost 5 minutes before the girl even realized I was there. She finally came up and I said I ordered a take-out. She asked for the  card used and an ID, I handed her my husbands card, she asked for an  ID again and I responded with my picture is on the card (Wells Fargo bank with a custom picture from our wedding). She said she couldn't accept a card without ID so I pull out my drivers license, getting rather irritated at this point because the girl is being extremely rude. She said she won't accept the card because my ID doesn't match. I said it was my husbands card and it's a joint account, my picture is on it and my last name matches his. Nope, that won't do. So she reverses the payment and I pay with the EXACT SAME CARD but with my name on it. So, now I have 2 charges on my account for the same thing until the other one reverses.  I just want dominos to know the girl working the counter was BEYOND rude and misinformed. It is actually illegal to refuse a VISA or MasterCard that is signed if the holder doesn't show ID...you can ask to see ID but the cardholder does not have to oblige and the card cannot be refused. I don't think I will be returning."}
{"text":"I'm Daniel a 7 year old boy who had dominoes today this is my review. You make the best pizza and you deliver it so fast."}
{"text":"Not sure what all the fuss is about but my pizza was piping hot and made just how I ordered it on the app. Did a coupon special and it was done in all of 10 minutes."}
{"text":"First Time Visiting here, just Order the Pizza along with Parmesan Bites and Soda - Requested for Crush Pepper and Ranch but didn't received it. Told the Driver he said sorry and I'll be back but never showed up. Called and requested again and they said sorry to add in the initial order, we are sending it now but again no body showed up. Really disappointed with service specially when you're serving your Hotels Guest."}
{"text":"My pizza and wings were delivered to my house in 20 minutes which is awesome. Plus, the delivery man was very nice and my pizza was MMMMMM MMM MMM!"}
{"text":"We eat pizza weekly and every several months we decide to try Dominos and each time we are DISAPPOINTED. (definition of insanity applies here I guess). This time we had a thin crust pizza not fully cooked and very few toppings.  The best thing were the wings. The driver was late (over 20 minutes for a 4 mile trip); he told us his phone died and he couldn't call for gate code -  hmmm you can call from box  at gate.   We are done they spend more on advertising then on making sure they create a good product - Bye Dominos!!"}
{"text":"Always delivers to me within 30 mins. Food is always hot. Delivery drivers are always friendly!"}
{"text":"When we are in the mood for a guaranteed good pizza, we get dominos. The large one topping hand tossed pizza with the garlic crust is great! See photo for visualization. Usually we do pick up and you have to leave your house once the order is placed as the pizza is done within 10 minutes.  Last night we ordered delivery with all the rain. It only took exactly 32 mins from when I submitted order online to being at my door! Very fast especially with all the rain.  Pizza has great flavor as long as you know it is different type of pizza than a Rosati's pizza. Highly recommended ever once in a while.  They do get a bad mark for not having any pepper or cheese packets ever! They told me they stopped stocking them! Wow! So make sure you have your own on hand!"}
{"text":"One star is generous.  Sitting in the lobby waiting for my pizzas which they didn't bother making even though I called it in 25 minutes ahead. Manager said it was a glitch.....incredible!!!  Many choices nowdays for pizza around here....."}
{"text":"Ordered my pizza online, 23 min delivery!  Met the nicest deliver guy! Older man by the name of Jay! He made me really appreciate the people who work late nights and still offer such a high level of customer service ! Top guy :)"}
{"text":"Expect your order to leave at least an hour after it's been perfected. They usually forget to bring the side of icing that's included when I order cinnamon twists. Despite this, my husband and I have remained loyal to this Domino's location. Our most recent order was a huge disappointment. I ordered a pizza without cheese and the photo attached is what I got. The pizza resembled a pita bread with barely any sauce drizzled onto it. I would hardly call this food. The pizza just doesn't seem worth the value anymore even with the coupon."}
{"text":"Great place with phenomenal food!! They always deliver fast. We usually order a couple of pies and some wings but I tried their chicken parm and it is delicious! Their deserts are pretty good too. Don't be afraid to try their new items, you'll regret it if you don't taste them! Overall great food and great service. Good location to order from without a doubt!"}
{"text":"Was perfect for Sunday. Pizza and Football is the best. Staff was also great and helpful. i Recommend this Domino's."}
{"text":"Stingiest franchise out there. I had to haggle for extra napkins. No cheese or peppers unless you buy a shaker. No plates or forks for the boneless wings. Food was hot and ready, stick to delivery but expect sub par service."}
{"text":"Do not waste your time. The manager is literally so unprofessional and was rude as hell when they were in the wrong and I was waiting for my pizza for over an hour . It got so bad the manager named Marco was literally screaming and yelling at me so badly to the point that I got an anxiety attack and told him I didn't want the food anymore because he answered the phone so viciously about them being in the wrong. I could not believe how messed up that was. I am seriously in shock . Do not go to this location. You will regret it 100%. The way they were acting makes me think they're so unprofessional they'll probably spit in your food as well. I'd give a 0 star if possible."}
{"text":"Great service and great good pizza and always willing to accommodate changes. The thin crust with garlic sauce is the best!!"}
{"text":"Service was pretty slow. Thought I'd order my food and it'd be ready when I arrived. I arrived 30min later onlly to be told my food would be another 8 mins. 15 mins later my order was finally ready. Almost an hr for a take out order. No apologies or anything and they wanted to charge me for a parmesean shaker. So much for ordering ahead of time."}
{"text":"This store SUCKS! I ordered  from here and it was more than 1 hour latter and still no order was delivered! I tried calling the store 3 times and there was no answer. I called corp. and they gave me the number of the manager and the manager did not answer and had no voice mail set up... DO NOT ODER FROM THIS STORE"}
{"text":"Glad to have one in the neighborhood. Like to have options, even in pizzas. Food is always hot and well-prepared. Delivery on time. Just wish they had coupons for the non-pizza items like the sandwiches, pastas and desserts. We don't aways order pizza!"}
{"text":"Family deals galore! Amazing food past few months of ordering. LOVE it!"}
{"text":"Ordered a pizza and parmesean bites at 10 it's now 11:30! Still not here, we called and were told the driver left 40 minutes ago, we live five minutes away! I'm pretty sure they have taken my pizza on a date, hopefully a hot one because I'm sure this pizza is bound to be cold if it ever arrives. Definitely will be my last pizza from Domino's."}
{"text":"Hunger- you tricked me again....  After a busy day I get home and am super hungry and don't want to fight traffic to get food (1st World Problem- I know...)  Pizza sounded good because it's a day ending in the letter Y. I realized I hadn't had dominos in a while so I place an online order- which was really easy- nice interface blah x3.   The pizza was delivered pretty slowly, the delivery guy was nice- I got my pizza and off he went.   I think Dominos has invented a pizza oven that somehow saps ALL semblance of flavor from the pizza. I'm not sure what mad pizza scientist made this machine- but it's good, damn good. The pizza looks like pizza but that is where the similarities end. The taste is remarkable in its blandness. I have to imagine movie prop food would taste better. I struggled to find ANY flavor at all- and remarkably there was none. Don't get me wrong, I know when I'm calling Dominos or it's competition- I don't expect Cibo, Bianco, Il Bosco type quality- but can it at least be as good as my first pizza love, Peter Piper Pizza?    Dominos pizza makes Costco look like artisan wood fired pizza in comparison. (It should be noted my love for Costco knows no bounds, but still.....)  Anyway- it's nothing personal- I'm sure the people at Dominos are lovely- but their pizza is not.  I hate wasting food- but I had to throw out the pizza after choking down a slice. It's really, really, poor. Like if aliens landed and tried that for their first earth food- they would immediately nuke us out of the universe.   Save your taste buds and pride- and go anywhere else for pizza. Learn from my mistake. Life is way too short for flavorless pizza. You know it's bad when my dog sniffs it and shakes his head while wrinkling his nose like \"Nah brah- I don't need that in my life.\""}
{"text":"Please do yourself a faver and do not order from this location.... I ordered two large Philly steak and I got two large \"Philly Steak\" without ANY steak in it..... They are thieves to the fullest... On top of that this location's price is about 2$ more compare to any other location for the reason, I explained....\"Thieves\" The Other time I ordered a pizza with extra chicken .... what I got was with extra olives... wow I will not ever order from this location again.... Please do not make my mistake...."}
{"text":"Dominos is usually ok, but this is the worst Dominos by far. Sure, given that we ordered on December 31 at like 8 something at night, but they really don't have to rush the hell out of our order and have raw dough?!?!! Geez - we had two regular crust pizzas and they were both undone, but we were so hungry and ready to go out that we didn't say anything about it. I'm pretty sure they should be able to tell that their pizzas are not done. We also got a thin crust pizza, which was pretty good and definitely done. But I would never order pizza from here again."}
{"text":"Wow!!  I'm very impressed! You better make sure to get your money ready BEFORE ordering online because it's VERY quick and HOT!! FIVE THUMBS ON THIS DOMINO'S!!"}
{"text":"Just ordered delivery. The toppings were skimpy and the crust was greasy!!! Will not order from here again."}
{"text":"Food was prompt and hot. They forgot the dips but when I called the store, they assured me a driver is on the way with my dips. They said it would take 5-10 minutes. It has been 30mins. My pizza is now cold."}
{"text":"This location deserves no stars. Save your money and go else where. Ordering here you risk under cooked pizza, rude service, just not worth your time or money. Most of the employees look like they are miserable and they probably don't wash their hands!"}
{"text":"Would of gave 1/2 star. I'm the least pickiest when it comes to pizza but I would rather eat a hot pocket from a microwave than from this location again. It was undercooked, sauce was way too much & salty and couldn't taste any cheese whatsoever. I have had dominos at other locations with no complaints until now. Save your time and money."}
{"text":"My wife orders here every 6 months or so since they make gluten free pizza.  She got her pizza with green chilis instead of green peppers.  I decided to order wings and they are the worst wings I've ever had.  They had the consistency of jello. That could be because they took an hour longer than promised to get delivered.  If you think of using this Dominos, have more respect for yourself.  Even a homeless person shouldn't eat this @#$%."}
{"text":"There's a delivery man who coincidentally never has change for a 20. This is the second time it has happened. I've called the store and they don't give me any options for how to handle the situation but this guy is going around getting \" pity\" $20 tips because he doesn't have any change . Want to let other customers know to beware ."}
{"text":"Ordered a pizza today and got philly cheese steak and stuffed cheesy bread with garlic dipping sauce.  Pizza arrived in a decent time. Food was hot and fresh. Didn't get my dipping sauce which I paid for. There was a piece of bone on my pizza so I guess they use real meat. I could deal with the bone but charging for dipping sauce and not delivering it I can't deal with. First 1-2 dipping sauces should be free when ordering cheese bread or anything you would dip for that matter. If your going to nickel and dime your customers you should make damn sure they receive what they pay for.       6/18/2016 Reordered again and much better service this time around. I received everything that I ordered. I called in my order and the manager assisted me he was very friendly and courteous."}
{"text":"I order pizza was cold  the manager  jenifer or general  manager didn't  answer my  complaint  .I order grill  chicken  and  they  run  out  they  never  asked  me., that   if I want  fry  chicken  they  just  add to my  pizza  when I  got  home  that's  when I  noticed."}
{"text":"Part 2 of review: After speaking with the GM at the store I was told he would credit the food back and if Ever decided to come back he would put a credit on my account, mind you this is a 5-6 at night he called me off his personal phone and along what I said above he stated   That he would call me first thing at 4pm the next day. Next day came by by 6pm I decided to give him a call he apologized said he was busy. Which I want to give him the benefit of the doubt but man this is like 6 stickers between you and your higher ups. Long story short he credit the amount to my card, never said anything about outing a credit on the account so I don't think we would be going back just because all the promises not kept and the pathetic way there higher up asked me is I kept the phone that we vomited out 3 days prior. Anyways Andrew the GM at this store was cool he could had done little more."}
{"text":"Best Dominos I've ever been too. Staff was friendly, communicative, and respectful. Big smiles and big fun was being had here. If you want the pizza  dominos off Scottsdale Road is the place to go. Professionals only at this place!"}
{"text":"The pizza was lopsided as if they didn't even really beat the doe. I've worked at dominoes before so this is completely unacceptable. No wonder it took literally 5 minutes for the order to be in the oven."}
{"text":"Ordered 2 pizzas here for carryout and they were made correct and were tasty that is the only reason they are getting 2 stars. The customer service is severely low class. Asked for parmesan cheese and they wanted to charge me for it haha and asked for plates and they were \"out\". They gave me 4 napkins though for 2 large pizzas, you're a pizza place there's only a few things you have to get right and the staff here can't seem to figure out how to do that. RARELY order from this place and this is the last time."}
{"text":"The pizzA is okay, nothing special, a lot better places in my opinion. Pretty cheap but I guess you get what you pay for. Since this is the closest pizza shop near us we will probably be back."}
{"text":"Sub par. Sandwiches were missing items and hand tossed crust did NOT have garlic crust. Wouldn't recommend."}
{"text":"this place is total disappointed I placed an online order and and i was witting for more then 30 min and nothing didn't got my pizza yet i check the app that they have and its show that i got it already and delivered by matt so I called to see when my pizza would arrive. The guy on the phone told me it should be any min but the delivery guy got to my place only 10 mins after. When the driver arrived it wasn't even matt it was a different employee. After she gave me my order she told me that their printer wasn't working so she didn't have my receipt. so When I got my pizza it was already getting cold. how to can eat a not fresh and hot pizza? . its the last time I order from this place."}

{"text":"I would like to compliment the manager at this location of Dominoes Pizza. His name is Adali. He assisted us the other night with an past issue we had with a delivery,  and he was so patient, professional, and understanding of my situation.  I truly appreciate his excellent customer service. He made sure he took care of my issue, and did it with kindness, and I believe he is an Asset to The Dominoes team, and deserves recognition. I worked in the Casino Industry for 30 years, and I know excellent customer service,  and he is a 5 star employee.  Thank you for taking the time to listen to my feelings.   Respectfully,   Donna  gweeee1@aol.com"}
{"text":"I ordered from this dominos Sunday when Panthers played Cardinals,  I bought two cheese pizzas and the very next day 4 people including myself got very sick. One of them went to the hospital. Will never order from here again and don't recommend anyone to buy from here especially on a busy night."}
{"text":"Awful awful experience.  Please take your hard earned cash elsewhere.  We ordered and after 1 1/2 hrs we called and spoke with Pete the mgr who said there was no order.  We discussed who we talked to, gave all info, etc. and they continued to say we were wrong.  We called back from the number we first called, just to make sure we didn't dial wrong..spoke w the mgr again and told him the person who took the order, who we had the name, was incompetent and he needed to address it and he hung up.  We called back and he wouldn't even listen.  We are all in customer service, we know mistakes can be made but you at least listen and either make it right or just say sorry and thank you.  You sure as heck don't hang up on your customers! We will spread the word to never ever ever order from Dominos and we will be  calling Corporate to notify them of their not so stellar staff.  Plenty of other pizza places and plenty of deals out there that provide way better service."}
{"text":"Great quality. Fast service. Good people. Definitely the best ordering option near campus. Drivers are really chill too."}
{"text":"I order from Dominos almost exclusively on account of how great their app is. In every other experience I've had the food has always been good and consistent from every location I've ordered from, from Ohio to Arizona. However, this particular location has let me down regularly. 8 out of 10 times I order from here they get \"lost\" on the way to my apartment, which is only about 2 blocks away. If the delivery time is projected to be 30 minutes, expect to wait about an hour and 10. I've made a habit out of turning my oven on about 30 minutes after I order, because by the time it gets here its usually luke warm and soggy. I don't love Dominos pizza over any other pizza, but I've been loyal to them for years due to the great service, low prices, and convenience. If you are in delivery range of this location and are considering ordering in then I suggest ordering elsewhere. I am now choosing to walk to Pizza Hut rather than get my rewards from the app, getting a free pizza isn't worth it anymore."}
{"text":"The secret with Domino's Pizza is to order the Brooklyn style pizza, which is thin crust, Brooklyn style pepperoni, provolone cheese in addition to the mozzarella, whatever toppings you prefer, although not too many, and ask for it well done.  This is a much tastier pizza than anything that Boring-Boring (Pizza-Pizza) or the other big chains do, and it's very consistently well prepared.  I also find their chocolate chip cookie brownie mashup to be a pretty tasty dessert, probably one of the better deserts of any of the pizza joints.  Let's be clear, this is not napoletana pizza, this is not Danforth Pizza House quality, this is just the best of the big pizza chains. Worth a go, try it and see if you don't agree."}
{"text":"This is my favorite dominos pizza I have ever been to. The service and pizza is amazing. I really enjoy the new mobile app as well. It should win an award!"}
{"text":"This store lost a customer. After the manager disrespected my role as customer I no longer will be ordering from this particular store."}
{"text":"It wasn't bad. I haven't had Domino's for a long time. I never really liked their pizza. The reviews looked good and I know they changed their recipe, so I gave it a shot. Online ordering was awesome and accurate. The driver was really nice and even had a milk bone for my dog. The pizza was fine, but not amazing. It was definitely not good the next day. Cold or reheated. I wish other pizza places had the same delivery system and drivers. I probably won't order from them again."}
{"text":"Good pizza but not great service and we have been here twice in the last month and both times they gave us the wrong kind of wings. The pizza was good but were disappointed by the wings the past couple times we've been"}
{"text":"If it weren't for Yelp making me give it at least 1 Star, this place would get ZERO, that's right, ZERO stars.  I have had one bad experience after another with these guys.  The pizza is great, IF you ever receive it after they tell you it will be a 30-min. delivery, then you call back after 1hour and they tell you \"the driver is on his way\", then you call back after another half hour and they can not locate your order... WTF???? have you ever heard of a COMPUTER system where you LOG orders when people call????  I know, what a fantastically high-tech concept but then maybe people would get the pizza they ordered.  I am finally writing this review because i just had the same experience at a Domino's in Phoenix ( I live in San Fran and usually order from there), (COULDN'T BELIEVE IT), so this seems to be a widespread problem.  I will never again give Domino's my business."}
{"text":"Don't order from Domino's Pizza in North Las Vegas. They charged my credit card, then messed up the order. They said I would not get a refund on my credit card for three business days. Just a few seconds of their mistake and suddenly I am responsible for the charges for three business days. This is a management problem. I hope someone in Domino's corporate manager reads this. This is poor customer service. I will never again order from any Domino's Pizza as a result of what happened tonight as I wait for three days for my refund."}
{"text":"If I could give 0 I would. Do not order from here. I've ordered from here a few times and it seems it got worst every time. This time was the last time. I put in an order at 3:30 for a cheese steak, chicken, cinnamon sticks and a drink. The guy pulls up an hour later even though the tracker online said he left a half hour before that. He's clearly rushing around and gives me everything but my drink and my check. I asked him where my drink is, he says 5 minutes hurridly gets in the car and drives off. 15 minutes later I call the store it came from and the woman who answered said that when he comes back to the store she will send him with my drink and check. Another 10 minutes later he comes and gives me my drink. Then runs off to the car again until I asked him where's my check and he said \"oh no check\" shrugs his shoulders and drives off again. So I make another call. I requested to talk to the store manager and she replies \"I am the store manager\". So she already knows what happened... she says \"I told you when he comes in the store I'll send him with your drink and check\". So where did he go and get my drink from? If he never went back to the store? So then I ask if I can get a refund because this whole ordeal was ridiculous and she says that I cannot get one because I've gotten my food, and that she'll send the guy back with my check. I just ended it with I don't want the check now and I won't be ordering from here anymore. Do not order from here the service is horrible."}
{"text":"Incompetent workers here. My order sat on the rack for 13 minutes while I waited up front. I was the only one waiting in he store so I'm not sure why they couldn't put the one ready order with the one waiting customer together. Too busy folding surplus pizza boxes. Go to another location."}
{"text":"I live just a half mile from the store in stone canyon apartments. Food was fast and hot. Kayla the delivery girl was nice, great smile and hands down the most beautiful delivery woman I have ever seen. Hopefully next time I order she will deliver again. Great job kayla."}
{"text":"I walked in and all the staff was so friendly! This is my go to take-out pizza shop on a cold and lonely night!! Kobir took my order and added extra black olives for free!! Yay, love him!"}
{"text":"Had a disappointing experience here. Ordered some takeout for dinner on Friday. After a long drawn out very confusing conversation with the operator we placed our order. We told them specifically we lived north of Bloor. They took our address and postal code.  They called us back 20 minutes later to say they could not deliver north of Bloor, leaving us hungry and unimpressed. We will not be ordering from here again."}
{"text":"You know after years of horrible pizza Dominos has come a long way. I have to say I love love love their think crust pizza and the boneless chickens. It's cheap and now very good.   Today I decided to see what's up with the rest of their menu. I kindda wanted to get everything because how can you go wrong with a menu with items for $5.99 you can't it's awesome!   I ordered the thin crust of coarse which they offer 2 medium 2 topping for $5.99 each so I get that with pep and beacon like always and if I chose the 1 large 3 topping for $7.99 still a good deal I would've add olives which would have been perfect.   Then I order the stuff cheesy bread (Jalopino and Bacon) which was Canadian bacon btw I didn't know that. It was ok but wasn't my favorite it was cheesy and too pickled jalopinoy if that makes sense. It could've use some sauce. Then there's the specialty chicken I seriously thought this item wouldn't last but they still have it and it was actually really good. I ordered the cheesy BBQ and bacon of coarse...you see a theme here? Bacon, bacon and more bacon if you can't tell by now I love bacon! Anyhow yes although the BBQ sauce in the box looked completely burnt it taste great minus the burnt part.   Ok so now that I've gone a little renegade and tried those two new item I have to try their hot sandwiches because they have that also now and their chicken Alfredo because I love Alfredo anything! So as soon as I do I will update my review and let you all know how the Dominos fall! Hehe!"}
{"text":"Kinda is hard to write this cuz I was always a fan of dominos, they've made some good changes to the pizza and I enjoyed them.  However..tonight is not about the pizza. My kids and there friends didn't want pizza after football practice(they are 14) so they decided on subs/sandwhiches.  I ordered 3 hot subs and an order of pasta.  I was soooo disappointed when I got my order and saw the size of the subs and pasta portion.  So very small, they boys were like...ok, wheres the rest of it.  Seriously, didn't even fill them up.  Ended up having to go to subway for 5 dollar footlongs to fill them up. on the plus side, they said the dominos subs tasted good, just need to be bigger. all in all it was a waste of 30 some odd dollars, well more cuz I had to fork out 15 and some change at subway.  Doubt we will be ordering here again."}
{"text":"Regularly order from this location and love. But today as we were decorating a driver flew past the speed gravel and swerved around me. As he came back o to my street I started taking pictures due the excessive speed. He stopped and asked why I was shining a light. I explained that I was picturing his reckless driving in the neighborhood. He tried to tell me the speed is 25 ( which he was well in excess of). I told him the speed was 15. Unfortunately I will no longer order from this location."}
{"text":"Well..the pan pizza turned out a lot better than the regular pizza they serve. The dough is thicker and it just tastes 100 percent better. The price was pretty good as well - only $8.99 for a medium two-topping."}
{"text":"I really wish I could give this location ZERO stars. My aunt placed an order for her kids and I went to call to ask for a simple update as to where the order was. The manager Tony was very rude and could not even act like he cared. He was quite aware of his demeanor and remained unphased when I let him know that I'd be reaching out to corporate to report my experience. All he wanted to do was remind me that it is 7 PM on a Friday night and I ordered from the \"busiest\" location in all of Las Vegas. All this told me is that this staff does not know how to operate under pressure. This comment really disappointed me. As someone who represents a business, you do not make excuses to the people that support you. It took my order nearly 45 minutes from when the tracker said they were on the way. The delivery person did not apologize for taking longer than expected and was really nonchalant. When my aunt asked what took so long all he had to say was \"I got lost at an apartment building\". Do not put your money where they don't care about how you're treated. I have never experience a more disappointing experience. I understand being busy, but I do not understand treating customers poorly."}
{"text":"Horrible. Horrible. Horrible. Sloppy pizza. Not cut. WAY to much sauce. Third time I've had problems with this dominos but this is just horrible. Couldn't even eat the pizza because it had to much sauce."}
{"text":"Saw their driver on Perryville and the 10 smoking in the car while delivering pizza. I was going to call and give them a heads up, but looking at the reviews, I doubt anyone would care. Don't bother picking up the phone. You must have cereal in your pantry."}
{"text":"Used to love getting from here, but last two times the orders are completely messed up.  Time to go somewhere else."}
{"text":"For a chain pizza restaurant this Dominos is hitting on all cylinders. I have never had a bad pizza from this store. You also have to try the Brooklyn Style thin crust pizza *with light on the sauce, it's awesome! crispy folding crust, perfect sauce, cheese Yum!  This Domino's is my go to Pizza Delivery Joint! Two Thumbs UP!!!"}
{"text":"We haven't been Domino's fans for a long time, but we received a gift card so we decided to give it a go. Ordering online was a nightmare as the app had some glitch and our original order went to a different location. We then tried on my laptop and even though I picked the location we wanted to pick up from it went to the same location the first went to. We were frustrated and hungry so my husband called in and they were quick to get our order ready. My husband picked it up and it smelled good, but that was as good as it got. My pizza was dry and almost tasteless and my husband ordered extra sauce (which he orders from other pizza parlors without issues) which made his pizza super soggy. The cheese was cooked but not melted like mozzarella is supposed to. We were glad we didn't pay for our meal, but were still greatly disappointed."}
{"text":"I hear a lot of people bragging about growing up in \"insert your northeastern city here\" and how great the pizza is there.  Pizza should be like this.  Pizza should not be like that.  Blah, blah, blah.  The way I see it, I had it good growing up in the middle of nowhere.  I grew up eating chain store pizzas and loved it!  And now that I'm all grown up I not only appreciate great pizza (hard to find), but I also enjoy good cheap macro produced pizza.  It all has its place.  And when I want a fast, cheap pizza Domino's does the trick.  I prefer the pepperoni and salami (recommended by my fiance who will never admit to it), but also really like the double bacon.  Two mediums two toppings for twelve bucks.  Home alone for the weekend?  Boom.    Five star it ain't.  But if you aren't snobbish about pizza and what you think it ought to be, Domino's is a tasty way to spend a meal."}
{"text":"What a rip off their new salads are. Got a coupon from Groupon for 50% off a pizza and my friend insisted on having a salad, so I had no say in this, otherwise when I went to pick up the food I would NOT have taken the salad, which cost something like $6.75 and was enough for one person as a pre dinner salad, but definitely not enough to fill one person up if all they wanted was a salad. Sorry Domino's, but you are ripping people off with your salads and really screwed this up with your roll out."}
{"text":"This is the place! I come here with my friends for a late night pizza or I order online if I usually want it delivered. They're used to college kids because it's on the campus but the workers are nice and friendly every time. I recommend dominos pizza or the pasta bread bowls. They're bomb!!"}
{"text":"Very fast delivery time and awesome service! Never had an issue with Dominos and they offer more variety than their competitors so I go with them :)"}
{"text":"Today is June 11.  My wife and I ordered pizza on April 9th, from the Domino's in Las Vegas at 4966 Maryland Parkway and she is allergic to dairy.  The associate we spoke with ensured us they would be careful and she had nothing to worry about.  I called after the pizza had arrived to inform them that she was very ill, and the associate told me that maybe she should not have ordered from Domino's then.  When I was displeased with his answer, I was hung up on.   I wrote a letter, and was contacted by a regional manager, who put me in contact with the store manager, and I was offered an apology and a refund.  It has been two months and I have called several times, and while they say they are trying to do the refund, I wonder if anyone is really trying anything.   It is apparent to me that there is an extreme management problem going on here and no one knows how their systems work.  I only wanted the refund because of the blatant disrespect i was given over the phone when I was letting the store know my beautiful wife was extremely sick on our vacation, and they were the reason for it.  My advice to anyone with allergies, GO SOMEWHERE ELSE.  I don't even want the refund anymore because I am so very annoyed with everyone's absolute incompetence.  Papa John's is always very helpful, and my wife has never been sick, because they mean it when they say they are careful with their product.  I will never order Domino's again, and tell everyone I can about this experience when the discussion of ordering out is brought up."}
{"text":"Normal Dominos food, not great, not horrible, better than Pizza Hut.  I did get a little irritated about the facility calling me after placing an order for 7 pizzas.  They didn't call to verify the order, what they called for is to tell me that how I should have called them to give them a heads up about the large order.  I agree, however, when I order online, I am not sure what location is going to handle the order until the order has already been placed.  If it's that big of an issue, Dominos needs to flag you directly on their website to do that."}
{"text":"This dominos had the worst attitude and customer service i have ever experienced. I tried to order on the phone and the man continued to cut me off and never let me finish what i had to say as if i were a bother to him. Horrible customer service, i will never be spending my time or money at this location again !"}
{"text":"After an hr wait. This is how we got the pizza tried to catch the delivery girl but she was gone. Called waited on hold for 4 minutes. Didn't get an apology just got a refund. Now I can't feed my kids..."}
{"text":"This Domino's is the only one I'll eat at lol every other one I've been to has been gross. Good service too."}
{"text":"I live in Henderson and have a dominos right down the street BUT we order from this store because they know how to make a good pizza AND provide good customer service....."}
{"text":"I have had problems with the pizza coming from this location and after many tries we now just drive to the Boulder City location where they make a FANTASTIC pizza. I dont understand how this location cant make a decent pizza"}
{"text":"Some decent changes seem to be happening here - at least last night. Ordered the two-topping medium pan pizza special for $7.99 which turned out decent. Always a big fan of cheese sticks, so i decided to add the $5.99 stuffed sticks and these were clearly the highlight of the meal. You cut them yourself, but it ends up about six or seven slices of very cheesy bread. These are definetly guilty pleasures. Only negatives is that it will cost 75 cents for any dipping sauce for the bread (blue, marinara, etc) and they don't provide parmesan cheese packets. Everything was done online and arrived hot after about 25 minutes."}
{"text":"We ordered pizza, after getting the message that the pizza was delivered we call to check where the pizza was. They said it was a problem of the app.ñ, and that the pizza will be delivered in 12min. After that, we waited for 30min and we called back. They said that I needed to wait 20 more minutes... we ended up waiting for 1hour 50 min.... and guess what? The pizza was cold"}
{"text":"Love this Domino's location that delivers to us! ALWAYS super quick and fresh, friendly drivers, and they brought us a shaker of red pepper flakes! Always makes our night."}
{"text":"Well they keep bragging about how good their stuff is but it still tastes like sh*t. It is still worse than Pizza Hut and Papa Johns which is pretty bad because they are both crap too. It tastes like the same old crappy Dominos with extra salt and 10 cents worth of herbs added on and some garlic goop smeared on the crust. I'm not sure if it's any better, it's just different. That's about what I expected, but I'm still pissed. Also on my box it said \"the road to enlightenment is paved with sliced italian sausage\" and my inner Kwai Chang felt repulsed. \"For all life is precious nor can any be replaced.\" A road of meat to enlightenment?! F- them.  0 stars!"}
{"text":"Second time I've ordered from this location, and second time they've gotten the order wrong. Tonight my son ordered a vegan pizza, yet it was brought with cheese. He ran out to catch the driver.. The driver told him to call in to let them know. So he calls in and they say it's on the way. An hour later it's still not here. I call back in and the manager says he doesn't know why the girl told me that and that it just came out of the oven. Oh and FYI a medium vegan pizza with tip is almost close to $40!!! The delivery driver dropped off the new pizza TWO hours later.. He tells me \"you can have the pizza for free\".. So I stood there waiting for a refund, and nothing. So I called back and of course they see no reason to refund me. I gave the second delivery driver a tip since it's obviously not his fault. So $38 for a cold vegan pizza two hours later. Clearly I won't be ordering from this location again."}
{"text":"Very tasty thin crust."}
{"text":"Holy Atomic Pile of Sh!t Batman!!!! This stuff sucks.... Like the previous reviewer I got sucked in by the commercials. Plus they were the only ones open at 9:50PM for delivery. Else we would have done Barro's Pizza, which by the way is awesome!  Yes the website makes the process look cool but it is 2010 and I know high school kids with flashplayer skills that can do the same thing.  On to the food review!  We ordered a thin crust cali bacon chicken ranch pizza with mild chicken wings, cheesy bread, and that chocolate crunch cake thingy.   The Pizza and Bread... Tasted like they put tons of salt on it. I was hoping that the additional green peppers, onioins, and mushroom would give it some flavor but I would not  have noticed they were there if I did not order it. The crust was all right but how do you screw up a thin-crust? Let's not hold them to that though...  The cheesy bread was cheesy, crappy, and salty all rolled into one.   The chicken wings were not as cooked as I would have liked which made it even more gross.  There was a lot of skin on them. GROSS GROSS GROSS!!!  I am not sure what kind of sauce they put on it but it looked like watered down ketchup and it just looked plain nasty. It did not look appetizing at all! On a normal day I can throw down a double order of wings with no problem but with this I only ate 2 pieces and said to myself \"what a waste of money.\"   The chocolate crunchy thing tasted okay but it was very sweet. I might be diabetic now because of it.   Next time it's late and no one is open for delivery then I will either starve or get my lazy as up and drive somewhere that is open. Considering In-n-Out and Denny's is right down the street from me I definitely wasted my money.   If you enjoy wasting money on pooh then by all mean go for it.  I would give this place negative stars if I could."}
{"text":"Austin is amazing! He is on top of things and helped us out a lot tonight!!! We appreciate him!! Thank you Austin, for getting us food on time!!"}
{"text":"I'm rating this a 1 because it is the lowest I can go.  An hour after I had placed my order, it still hadn't been started; event though the app told me it had been started 45 minutes ago. In addition, the employees assured, 30 minutes later, it had been started, over an hour ago. I hate profanity, but I am fucking done with dominoes after this experience."}
{"text":"Haven't used Dominos in a long time . Thought I would give it a go. Saw the app advertised on TV . Used it and went pretty good other than the app getting my phone number off. I called the store to tell them and confirm food was coming . Over an hour after I placed the order they called and said the driver could not find my house and had already took the food back. no other place has ever had a problem. So no sale . I'm sure other places want my money and tip$..."}
{"text":"Horrible, horrible pizza.    We have ordered here twice.  The first time, the pizza and bread sticks were severely undercooked. We be into dough...   The second time the pizza was over cooked.. Black.  The spicy chicken we ordered was cold. Not one thing tasted good.   Thanks for the horrible service."}
{"text":"Love the online ordering ....... order was accurate........ driver was awesome... very smooth and fast......"}
{"text":"We always use this location. Our deliveries are always fast and the drivers are always nice. The pizza's are always hot and ready. Love this location"}
{"text":"Perfect tasty pizza & excellent prices too I order a hand tossed pepperoni & pineapple pizza & it was delicious I also received excellent service from domino's pizza"}
{"text":"Twice now my apartment number does not print on the delivery slip. Please correct this because it is EXTREMELY annoying to wait for a pizza for a hour, call the driver back, because I missed the call, only to get attitude from him and him telling me the order was cancelled. I then call the store and ask for a refund since they cancelled my order. The girl on the phone says it wasn't cancelled. So does that mean the driver just didn't feel like coming back?! FIX YOUR WEBSITE. Basically my two options are to be stuck with cold food after waiting an hour or no food. Online ordering is supposed to be convenient. I'm done with this restaurant. Plenty of other pizzerias around. Not going through this a third time."}
{"text":"Placed order online at 10:55 am and said 21 to 31 minutes plus it over billed me, website said out for delivery at 11:26, called 11:49 still not out of oven and refused to fixed over billing, asked for manager and he said not available for two days!"}
{"text":"Ordered from here the other night. My pizza crust was literally uncooked I mean it was still squishy malleable dough. I called back asking for a refund. They essentially told me to fuck myself."}
{"text":"Completed my order using Domino's App, I must say the pizza pan, and the chicken buffalo bites were absolutely delicious.  Defiently recommend, and will continue to order from Domino's Pizza."}
{"text":"We order from this Domino's quite a bit.  Our ultimate lazy meal.  Not only can I find a coupon and place my order on Dominos.com, but the coolest part is the Order Tracker that pops up after I complete my order.  It let's me know the status of my order in real time so I am constantly aware of where it's at in the process.  From order placed, to prep, to bake, to quality check, and finally out for delivery.  In the age of wanting real-time information, the Tracker is genius!  I love the American Legends pizzas.  My favorites are the Pacific Veggie (roasted red peppers, spinach, onions, mushrooms, tomatoes and black olives with feta and provolone cheeses on a parmesan thin cracker crust) and the Firey Hawaiian (sliced ham, bacon, pineapple, roasted red peppers, jalapeños, hot sauce, and provolone cheese on a parmesan crust) on thin or Brooklyn style.  The only drawback to ordering pizza is that the dog won't leave us alone when we have it, she wants some too and will stare us down.  Funny thing, she only does this with pizza.  I guess it's true that dogs often pick up the personalities of the owners and my Bailey loves pizza just like me!  Gotta wrap this up now . . . my pizza is \"out for delivery.\"  Whether it is a scorching weekday evening (today: 115+) when it is way too hot to even think about going outside or a late night craving on the weekends when it is just not safe for either of us to be driving, we pick up the computer and order a quick, easy, delicious meal.  Maybe even some Chocolate Lava Crunch Cakes if we want to splurge on dessert."}
{"text":"Pizza is delicious, you can order and track your order online. Delivery guy Seth was really friendly and on time. Pizza had the right amount of toppings and extra cheese!"}
{"text":"In terms of fast food pizza options available in the  area, Domino's might be one of the best options. Unfortunately, each order is a surprise : you might get it spot on (and make you want to order again in the future) or get something so disgustingly wrong that ell still have its benefit of making you NOT want to eat junk food ever again.   So here's the deal with this location: I always order online (can't stand talking to people on the phone)  and despite the fact that 99% of my orders are always the same, they still manage to somehow get things wrong. Such simple requests (to me at least it seems simple) as \"light sauce\" and \"ranch dipping sauce rather than marinara or lightly done, seem to be the most complicated of equations and as stated before, it can be a hit or total miss.   It's a shame but ultimately it works in our favor as the inconsistency makes us question our food choices."}
{"text":"Disrespectful workers . Don't got chili peppers. 1 napkin per person lol . After I ordered 4 boxes of pizza ."}
{"text":"Customer service sucks and it was just chaotic in there. I was told \"maybe you placed your order at the wrong dominoes\" when they couldn't find my order...but I walked in like 5 min before to pay for it.. I paid for it but now you can't find it??"}
{"text":"I cant believe that we stopped ordering from here and started using pizza hut two blocks away but my son wanted the cheese bread. The ONLY way ill order is if i get sausage and green pepper and thats the ONLY pizza they screwed up! Im SO pissed off It looks like its spicy sausage possibly? The same thing was ordered on both pizzas but they were different.  Unbelievable!  No more, pizza gut is two blocks down,  thanks for no dinner tonight Dominos."}
{"text":"Good job Dominos the sauce is a big improvement and the crust was cooked correctly. Called in my order they said it would be half and hour is here in fifteen. Only complaint don't run out of ingredients."}
{"text":"I'll be blunt with this review: I absolutely cannot stand this Domino's. I don't even mean in terms of the pizza itself. Sure, the pizza isn't exactly GREAT, but I don't think it's particularly bad either. Not fabulous, but ok enough for someone like me.  So with that in mind, my problem with this location has relatively little to do with their pizza and everything to do with my office's universal experiences as customers. Firstly, every month, my coworkers and I order from them for a monthly work event, and almost every time we call they insist that we're outside of their delivery range. When this happens we have to tell them that they do in fact deliver to us on a regular basis, and that we're located fairly close to them.  Then yesterday, after happily skipping this usual discussion our office was shocked to find ourselves waiting for over TWO HOURS for our pizzas to arrive. We don't expect things to get to us immediately after ordering, which is why we've always called in a while before lunch to place our order each month, but over two hours?! And each time we called they'd just tell us that it was on its way and it would be there soon.  When the pizza finally did arrive some poor woman told us she wasn't even working that day and they called her in. I felt bad for her, but then found myself feeling dumbfounded when she asked us at the front of our building, \"Do you need me to bring these pizzas up to your office?\" Well, yes - considering how hot the boxes were, how many we ordered, and the fact that we needed the Dominos delivery bag to take care of these issues...  I don't think we were even comped in any way for the trouble we went through, either (and believe me, we called to complain. Repeatedly.). I say don't order from these guys unless you really, really have too. Like I said, I love me some pizza, even when it isn't fabulous pizza - but when your service lacks this much, even my patience will reach its limits."}
{"text":"Under new management that no longer delivers to our neighborhood. Customer obviously lost, we will never eat here again."}
{"text":"Excellent tasting pizza. Just what we ordered by.phone to be picked up. Thin crust, cheese, sausage and mushroom. Everything's was fresh, price was low and hospitality was great. She was an excellent receptionist. Thanks Domino's. Best pizza yet in town."}
{"text":"The pizza was really good but the second time I ordered I go it 'carry out' so I stopped by the pizza shop- omg it smelled do bad like a sewer. I couldn't believe they had to work in those conditions. I didn't get my order because that turned me off. That smell ruined Domino's for me. Moral of the story, order delivery! Enjoy your pizza"}
{"text":"I really like this Dominoes location. I spoke to Carlos, the manager, tonight to use my pizza credit from a previous order. I was so delighted by Carlos' demeanor and quick help, that I am writing this review now. Friendly, helpful and there is never a problem with fixing a mistake... because no one is perfect. It is because of the little mistakes that I can't give 5 stars, but the pizza is so very good, a great value and ordering online is easy and rewarding (although I feel that if I order 6 pizzas that I should get 1 pizza free... but instead it is set up for 10 points for every time you order, no matter the amount, and after 6 orders you get a free pizza....). Thank you Carlos, and thank you Dominoes Pizza.  Update: Today's pizza was made SO PERFECTLY! That I am upgrading my review to 5 stars! I love it!  Thank you SO MUCH! My whole family LOVES it!"}
{"text":"We ordered lunch at 11:45. We were told delivery would be 45min -1hr. After more than an hour we called the store to check delivery. We were told the driver could not find our location (we are located on a main road) not hard to find.  He has no gps. After several more calls and 2 hours later, the \"manager\" said he would deliver our food to us in 5 minutes. I said we would not be willing to pay as our food was likely cold and our lunch was over by 1 hour. The manager reluctantly  said he would give me 1/2 off. No apologies were offered. In the end, we never got our food or an apology. Good luck if you decide to order from Dominos."}
{"text":"I don't even want to give one star.  I tried to order online, but because I wanted to pay cash, it wouldn't let me complete my order.  I tried to call the store to place my order and was put on hold for over five minutes.  I tried to call back and was asked if I could hold again.  Umm, No!  My daughter wanted Dominoes to celebrate her getting her drivers license.  Epic fail!  We ended up going elsewhere to spend our money.  This was a Tuesday night!!   We ordered pizza tonight from this location because we had a special offer for a 14 inch 2 topping pizza and breadsticks.  The delivery driver was courteous and prompt.  The pizza was a little overdone and lukewarm.  We had green peppers and sausage on our pizza.  The breadsticks were piping hot though.  I only can increase my rating by a star.  There are a lot better options.  Sorry:("}
{"text":"I ordered chicken Alfredo pasta and sausage marinara sauce, both with extra sauce. The Alfredo came lacking of sauce and the sausage marinara had no sausage. Now I remember why I deleted this app. Will not order again."}

{"text":"This place by far, is the worst pizza place I have ever been to. I walked in and stood by the register for about 10 min before being acknowledged. After 40 min wait, I complained that my app showed the pizza was ready but they said no. There was one more pizza in front of me so I had to wait another 20 min. The pizza was not cut according to my instructions, they didn't put the extra cheese that I paid for, the sausage tasted like it was stale, had to take it off and toss it. I normally don't like little Caesars but domino's made them look like a gourmet pizza compared to their awful tasting pizza. Also the bacon wrapped chicken I bought was one burned piece of gob! Couldn't tell what it was by the looks nor by the taste. It was awful. I do not recommend this store and will never re order from them."}
{"text":"Never get my order right. To bad because there white Pizza sauce is really good. I do however like there new salads."}
{"text":"Pizza i received had air bubbles all over! I ordered extra cheese and it barley had any cheese! I dont even think they put sauce on it!  Talk about a half ass job! That cook should be fired."}
{"text":"Terrible, the employees are nice, but the quality of the food is fricken awful. I was told most of the products come pre made. I ordered a gluten free pizza that had so much mold on the bottom, it surpassed any moldy pizza on Google images. I did get my money back two days later.  I was emailed that the location passed inspection.  But the food I ordered came pre made from the corporation.  I can only hope that the companies location that ships the products gets inspected too."}
{"text":"For a chain restaurant this pizza is adequate. A 75 minute wait time for delivery is unacceptable. Pizza was almost black on the bottom and the breadsticks were horrible. I will not order from them again"}
{"text":"Best customer service ever. ive been here over 5 times and can say everytime i left with not a single complaint. Everyone is so friendly and service is always fast."}
{"text":"I only gave them one star because they are the only restaurant that delivers in my area. The girls that take orders are very rude and usually my food is cold by the time it is delivered. But I don't have a car so I don't have a choice."}
{"text":"I have been a loyal dominos customer for 20+ years but this location has ruined the entire experiance for me. They are continuously late, its always cold, and the management and staff here does not care about your concerns so dont even try. I will not be ordering here ever again and i would advise others to avoid it at all costs."}

I want a pan pizza for the 5th time bimbo.. this lady needs to know the specials and work on her customer service because she was extremely impatient and rude. word to mouth is the best advertising and i have a big mouth... my pizza gets here and is cold and not what I asked for...surprise surprise smh.."}

{"text":"Wish u could give 0 stars. Customer service sucks, delivery takes over an hour even tho I like literally 6 minutes at most so yeah it sucks too. And the pizza is worse than both of the previous mentions. I'd actually pay money to starve before I order from this place. AND THEY DON'T WEAR GLOVES!!!"}
{"text":"I ordered a gluten free pizza online, and received an email that said the order would be ready in 12-17 minutes.  I arrived at the store in 15 minutes from placing the order.  The kid goes off to the side of the store and a couple minutes later informs me they are out of gluten free crusts but sent an employee to go pick up crusts from another store.  He asked if I wanted the pizza on a different crust.  If I pay extra for gluten free, it's not because I feel like throwing my money away, it is because I require gluten free.  So I left and decided I would get dinner elsewhere.  I called back and asked to speak with the manager, the kid wouldn't transfer me to the manager and I told him what had happened.  I gave a strong suggestion that next time something like that happens, he should call the customer AS SOON AS he recognized he does not have a gluten free crust (this was also on a Friday night).  The kid told me sorry and that I should have watched my dominoes tracker on my droid and noticed the pizza hadn't gone into the oven yet.  KID, next time CALL the customer.  NEVER go to this location."}
{"text":"I am so happy this location is super close.  I'm also happy I can order online, and I can use any number of online coupons to get my pizza cheap cheap (under $10 for large with pep).  The pizza itself tastes like every other Domino's outlet, which is predictable and good.  I'm also a fan of the cinna stix with icing dip.   Basically, anything sugary with dip is good in my books! I've only had one issue here with payment, but that was resolved with the help from a manager.  Also, they are a \"Passed with Conditions\" status from the City of Toronto, which is a bit scary....but I still eat here and have never had any tummy issues.  And besides...god made dirt, and dirt don't hurt!"}
{"text":"After I placed a completely incorrect order at my local Domino's, the manager on duty (Zach) corrected my issue and did it kindly! I greatly appreciated his help, because I was mortified at my mistake! I'll definitely continue coming here, especially with how easy it is to park now!"}

It had less cheese, there were pockets in Pizza with no cheese,two of them. Extremely dissatisfied, it will be a cold day in hell before l come back! Should of actually rated it a minus Star!  ED"}
{"text":"Came in with a free pizza coupon. I was greeted by Keith and he helped me out with excellent service"}

{"text":"This was my first time ordering from this location. I ordered online at around midnight, and ordered a pizza and some bread cheese thing. The food was here by 12:30. It was hot, and prepared well. If this place keeps up this level of quality, I will make it my go to for pizza."}

{"text":"Horrible, horrible, horrible! I will never order from a Dominos again. Food was delivered cold, wrong order, and the pizza was not completely cooked yuk! I called and the manager never returned my call. I contacted corporate and was told they would send me a gift card. I stated no because I'll not use Dominos ever again. I ask about their money back guarantee and was told I would receive a check. We'll need I say more? The chek is still in the mail somewhere. Nasty food"}
{"text":"Friendly people working. Food was done quickly. I was shocked that they charge for Parmesan cheese.  But then what do you want for a $7 pizza."}
{"text":"Awful customer service.. I guess their business is doing fine without your money.. as after you place your order on line.. they call you back and tell you they can't deliver there..however the next day they can....I talked to the delivery person .. he said they always deliver here... I call the manager and she said no.. I am handicapped and really needed to have food delivered.. what a joke... I will never order here again. I will go local for sure..   pretty sad.."}
{"text":"Payday Pizza Day!! Ordered this when I got into work and had it scheduled for Noon delivery...on time and delicious! We got a Thin Crust Memphis BBQ Chicken Pizza and Thin Crust Pacific Veggie Pizza with white sauce!! It was all awesome!"}
{"text":"Pete the pizza maker said at 11:59 my order will take approximately 30-40. He told me 12:26 Donna was on her way. It is a 5.2 miles / 11-minute drive at 1:00 I called the store saying Donna had not arrived. I was told she was delivering 4 more pizzas but she is on her way. It is now 1:26 1 hour and 20 minutes after Pete the pizza maker said it would take approximately 30-40 minutes. I called and was told that 'like 5 orders came within 30 seconds and my was the last one, he tried calling me at the hotel to tell me it was running late but kept getting disconnected. hmmm....??? If he would have connected to me would that have somehow made my pizza hot when it arrived? I cancelled."}
{"text":"Taste just isn't there!  For fast food delivery pizza, I prefer Papa Johns.  Best take out pizza in the area is Carmine's on Horizon.  Best pizza in the area is Settebello's, and a close second Pizza Rock either downtown, or in Green Valley, and then Grimaldi's."}
{"text":"Sometimes all you want in life is pizza because your stomach just can't handle the hunger. The total time from ordering to getting the pizza was probably 20 minutes. They seemed busy (I went in for a pick up). But after having had Pizza Hut the other say, which I loved prior to all the new changes they're going through, this Domino's pizza stole my heart. Pepperoni, Phillysteak, and beef hit the spot. The $7.99 large 3 topping deal just can't get any better. I don't know why Pizza Hut had to go fix something that wasn't broken. I also added the parmesan bites to the mix. Those were good. Or maybe I was just extremely hungry. Either way,  that cheesy pizza hit the spot."}
{"text":"Ordered a bacon cheeseburger pan pizza from here. The pizza was ten minutes later than the time said it would take to get here, which is really sad seeing this dominos is just down the road from us.  It came looking like we had ordered it yesterday and took it out of the fridge and had reheated it!!!!  and once again, they forgot the pizza sauce on the pizza!!!  I do not understand how a place that makes pizza forgets to put the pizza sauce on the crust!!  I called to complain about the pizza sauce and told them i could handle that the double cheese i ordered on it was not on the pizza, and i could handle the fact that it came cold, but i can't handle it having no sauce on it!! they did give us a credit for it, which is pretty much useless at this point with them... NOT IMPRESSED WITH THE DOMINOS!!!  I told my husband we should pick up a dominos pizza at one that makes a great pizza, because we have had them, and bring it to this dominos and show them how a dominos pizza should be made!!!!  This dominos, hands down, is the worst pizza place i have ever ordered from!!!! They had their pizzas half off the regular menu price... we still paid 12.16 for a medium pan pizza!!! plus a $4 tip for the driver..."}
{"text":"We ordered online. It doesnt get any better than the pizza we got from this Dominos!!!! Seriously,  my husband and I agreed this is the best pizza we have EVER had!!!!! We ordered a large brooklyn style crust with double cheese, pepperoni, italian sausage and bacon.  The delivery man was cheerful and it was very hot and fresh when we got it and absolutely DELICIOUS!!!! We also ordered a large order of their parmesan bites.... they were soooooo good! We will be ordering this again"}
{"text":"Fast hot quick that's what pizza should be about; and the staff they are really young but pretty professional.  I like this Domino's compared to others I have been to."}
{"text":"I order every time from this place, everything fresh, tasty, fast delivery, exactly what I want. 10 stars for you guys. I hope every business will be like you.  Thank you :)"}
{"text":"WORST DOMINOS PIZZA in MISSISSAUGA!!!  So long story short(sort of), I work night shift. Finish work at 8am. Had some running around to do so around noon I was still awake. Decided to order a pizza from this location. Went and picked up my Large pizza. 2nd slice in, I'm pulling a piece of hair, easily over a footlong out of the back of my throat! I was disgusted! Took a picture of it (the hair in the pizza) and dumped the pizza in the garbage. At this point I'm starving and tired so I'm just not in the mood for any of this. I decide to call the store back and explain to them what I just experienced, and even questioned why they don't wear hair nets while handling food. Manager apologized and said he'd comp me a free pizza. But only if  I went into the garbage took out the pizza and drove it back to the store, even though I told him that I took pics of it and said I'd email it. He refused and insisted that I take the pizza out of the garbage and personally drive it back... Ummmmmm 1st of all, why would I ever want another pizza from u?? 2nd, what makes you think that I'm going to go through the garbage to pull out a pizza, then I'm supposed to drive it back to you??? When you're the 1 who messed up??? Smh. Terrible customer service! Had I been the manager my offer would've been to have a pizza sent out to me, considering you have a delivery service. Yes I would've refused, but that would've been an acceptable offer or store credit. None of which were offered.  Nvr again!!!  Beware of HAIR!!! Should be a sign on this locations window!!!  Ur lucky I can't give a half a star. Don't even deserve a full one."}
{"text":"This location stays open an hour later than others, it (gasps) has actual seating and its pretty easy to find parking after 9. Never tried the delivery service but this place hits the spot. The pizzas are solid, with large toppings and even a new personal size pizza , it's a chain but above the others."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery last night. Pretty late because the boyfriend and I had just gotten back from work. I was reallllly craving some pasta, and we also ordered a half and half pizza. Only problem.... I ordered the pasta in a DISH and it was delivered in a BREAD BOWL. Ugh. I hate the pasta bread bowls from pizza places... First time ordering from this dominos, but if they mess up an order of one pizza and one pasta, something tells me that's what I can always expect. Won't order again from here. Good pizza, but the pasta was gross in soggy bread. Delivery driver was nice. 3 stars."}
{"text":"A few weeks ago I literally had the worst experience. Tonight a new guy took care of us and was amazing. Changing people and had the best pizza from dominos. Thank you!!!!"}
{"text":"Ordered at 6:55 pm we expected our order 21-31 from when we ordered according to the email we received. Didn't get our order until 8:10, not only was our order late but it was cold, and you paid extra for icing and didn't receive. This is terrible, never had I had an issue this bad."}
{"text":"Get the walk-in special Pan Pizza with double cheese. Delicious. Tastes very similar to Pizza Hut pan pizza, but half the price."}
{"text":"I know, 5 stars for a Domino's Pizza? Well, yes. I mean, as far as Domino's goes this location is great. I ordered from here the other day because I happened to be on this side of town. I was pleasantly surprised that I received exactly what I ordered, in the expected time frame, and the food was made with care. Nothing was burnt, the pepperoni looked placed, sliced evenly, the parmesan bites weren't greasy, the brownie was perfectly cooked. The employees were super friendly and appeared clean. If my kids ask for pizza I'll be driving to this location from now on since the location closest to my home is the WORST."}
{"text":"Despite my previous reviews I have continued to give this location my business pretty much every week. I have noticed drastic improvements over the last month or so, with the preparation of the food and customer service."}
{"text":"Dominos had a deal for $6 medium pizza, which I thought was a good deal and you get two toppings. Went to pick it up and they should have just said $6 small pizza, the box was a small. It serve probably 3 people if they all had 3 pizza each. When I went to pick it up the guy was on his cellphone, but don't worry he was nice enough to put his phone down when I came in. Not worth the savings."}
{"text":"The only reason I'm giving it 3 stars it's because my husband and I thought the pizza was good. It would've been 5 stars if the pizza would've been ready when I showed up. Had to wait about 10-15mins. Didn't get an apology or nothing."}
{"text":"Domino's Pizza at this location has recently been top-notch!  I have never received an undercooked or an overcooked pizza and have always received the order which I asked for.  The pizza is delicious!!! And the delivery people are usually very nice and grateful for any tips they are given."}
{"text":"I have been waiting 45 mins but still do not get my pizza. And when I ask them the employee said they are making it even though I ordered it from 40 mins ago. The pizza is good but the service is so bad."}
{"text":"Dominos everywhere taste pretty much the same... But this place get 4 stars because I ordered my food online and it told me 25-30 min which is avg. They were at the door in 15 min. :) very fast!!"}
{"text":"I've never encountered a more rude worker than when I did over the phone with some douchy ass 30 year old still lives with his mom pizza boy bitch"}
{"text":"Worst experience ever. The manager is a total dip shit. Told us he couldn't deliver to our address which was only 3 miles away. Trying to make our order for carry out instead and he tells me chicken is not a topping they offer on their pizza which is total bullshit. And then when we got there he hadn't put our order in the system so we have to reorder and wait another 15 minutes. Also was treating his employees like crap while we were there! I recommend all his employees quit and find jobs with better managers and no one ever order from here!"}
{"text":"We always love ordering from Domino's they are usually very fast and on time with hot food prepared just the way we like it/ordered it. Would be amazing if they added salads to their menu like Hungry Howie's has though, sometimes I have to have a good chef salad so we end up going with them....*hint hint!*"}
{"text":"Two times in a row I go and get my \"3\" topping pizza and half the pizza has HUGE dough bubbles and I asked for extra sauce both times dry and doughy. This is not acceptable Dominos!"}
{"text":"Pizza was hot....only thing is that the taste wasn't as good as the last time they delivered.... where is the consistency?"}
{"text":"I've ordered twice from this location and both the times the consistency of the taste of the food n on time delivery has been good... the pizza's were made well with good quantity of toppings n the food was hot when delivered n food was delivered within 30mins...so overall happy customer"}
{"text":"This location is the bottom of the barrel, in the last 12 months i have order from this location approximately 6 times, and 5 times the order has been wrong or never arrived! In my last exchange I was actually told by the staff member that they are to stupid to do it right, great training and CS dominos! #failing"}
{"text":"I've ordered from here numerous times and have had plenty of issues but I just keep going back in which this is the final straw with this dump. Every time I order a pizza, anything from here they take FOREVER!! And then sometimes complain that you don't tip them enough, I actually had one delivery driver tell me that my tip was too low like wow! Secondly most everyone that works here doesn't speak English at all and I can't understand a single world they are saying... I will try a new dominos in a different location and sometimes they even screw up your order as well... i would tell anyone to avoid this place and go get pizza from a local joint instead as the pizza I've gotten most times has been lackluster and dry at best"}
{"text":"WORST manager experience ever! We called in a cheese pizza. Literally. Just cheese. The manager was taking the phone calls and hung up on us multiple times! Wouldn't give us our total for delivery. Wouldn't you think it would be beneficial to know your total you're supposed to be paying?! Unreal. Called back multiple times and he actually yelled at us \"for being annoying\" LOL. Spoke to our awesome delivery driver who said everyone complains about this manager! Denny, Donny, Tommy...something like that. Duh the pizza was great but this manager shouldn't work with the public."}
{"text":"I've ordered at this location several times and have never had an issue. Domino's pizza has definitely gotten better over the years.   Today I ordered their large 2-topping pizza for $5.99 (carryout deal they have going on until May 28th). I made my order online because I like having the pizza tracker! I was given a 10-15 minute estimate and my pizza was definitely ready within that time-frame.   The pizza was DELICIOUS!! Loved the crust!"}
{"text":"I'm just excited to order. I have not tasted but it sounds good. Peace out kneegrow"}
{"text":"My roommate and I ordered dinner from here tonight. I ordered the steak and cheese sandwich and he ordered the build your own pasta. My sandwich was delicious however the amount of pasta my roommate received for the price was totally skimpy. It covered the bottom of the small tin it was in and was MAYBE 1 in of pasta. VERY unsatisified with the amount of  pasta. You really need to increase the amount of pasta it is not an expense item."}
{"text":"Very disappointed in the pepperoni pizza I ordered for delivery.  Price was competitive however very low quality of pizza taste makes me very unlikely to ever order again.  On a positive delivery service was timely"}
{"text":"I went to pick up a pizza at this store and i noticed that none of the wear gloves, and he was going through topings using his bear hands which who knows what he did before start making this pizza, i will not go there anymore"}
{"text":"As far as Dominos goes this location delivers.  I love the chicken and bacon pizza with bbq sauce.  So good.  I always order online and love the pizza tracker.  Georgi is always very polite and very fast.  Use the coupons and you can't go wrong.  Free delivery with Shoprunner."}
{"text":"Placed my order at 10:13 online and got it at 10:41.  Only 28 minutes! Not bad!  I ordered the Wisconsin 6 Cheese Pizza on Brooklyn Style crust for $11.99 with their online coupon.  My order was prepared perfectly.  Best Dominos order I've ever had.  The online pizza tracker is awesome.  Hilarious when you select a theme.    Don't get me wrong. This isn't the best pizza you'll EVER have, but if torn between the usual chains this location seems to perform flawlessly.  Definitely the best Dominos pizza I've ever had, and that's saying a lot from somebody who used to hate Dominos."}
{"text":"How not to get a regular customer. That's what I thought when I opened up the box upon delivery. All the toppings I had ordered were there. Yep, I could count how many of each were there, on what seemed like, one hand. Never ordered from them again. No value."}
{"text":"This Domino's is the closest near my house and they're service is always superb. The food is always hot, always correct and very delicious."}
{"text":"My boyfriend has always liked Domino's so we ordered 2 pizzas.   Mine was pepperoni and pineapple and my partner's was bacon & ham.   I can't think of any pizza that's tasted this bad.   Worse than Hungry Howies.   And Little Ceasars is a gourmet pizza in comparison.   The pizzas arrived at the door in good time.   I tried to eat mine,  but the sauce and the pepperoni  both tasted rancid.    I was only able to eat the pineapple and the crust which I usually discard.   We didn't order the pizza well done, but the pizza was burnt,  but the crust was all I could eat just because there was no sauce on it and I had to eat something so I could take my meds..   I have had frozen pizzas that tasted better.   I also couldn't eat the pepperoni because it tasted stale.     I won't be getting pizza from this Domino's again.   Yuck!   Bad bad job Dominoes.   We are very disappointed!"}
{"text":"I placed my office lunch order at 11:45. One thin crust pizza and chicken bites.  Pretty difficult, right? I didn't think so.   It is now 1:15. The pizza is still not here.  When I called, the guy on the phone was completely unapologetic. He told me I would have to wait another 10 minutes or so, because the driver still had 6 other pizzas to deliver. What?!   I'm still waiting... still haven't heard anything. I decided to ask for my money back and called back. No answer. I've been calling for 20 minutes, never got an answer! What kind of business are they trying to run, here? If they couldn't accommodate my tiny order, I would have appreciated a courtesy call.   It is 1:30. I just now received my pizza. Still warm, however the chicken bites were burnt and not good at all.   Very unhappy, and most certainly will not use this domino's for my work orders again. Way to make friends in the community!   Hope your store gets their stuff together. This is pretty ridiculous."}
{"text":"oh my gosh!!!  Dominos pizza is so good that they add extra sauce for free !!!  Tell us if u like dominos pizza!"}
{"text":"Ordered pizza and specialty chicken, and forgot to put my complex gate code in the order for the driver. I've done this in the past, and the driver usually calls me as soon as they arrive at the gate.  The average time from the store to the apartment is 10 minutes. Today, I decided to call the store 20 minutes after the tracker showed the order the store. I reached somebody named Dave that talks like he's had way too many Red Bull's. I couldn't get a word in edgewise to give him the code to give to the driver. Instead, he stated that the driver had been trying to call for half hour, and confirmed my phone #.  First of all, my phone was in my hands the whole time and didn't ring. Secondly, the driver couldn't have been at the gate more than 10 minutes. (Simple math) The driver called as I tried to get a word in with Dave, and stated that he was at my door. He ended up at the wrong building, which is not unusual, but got here within 30 minutes.  The food was your average Domino's quality, but a little cooled off after waiting so long to get it.   Dave, Don't piss on my shoe and tell me it's raining. Also learn that customer service is only that when you listen to your customers. Remember the 75/25 rule. You should only speak 25% of the conversation, and listen the rest."}
{"text":"i Can't believe the customer service i just received from Maria the Manager of this place i called to make a complaint and she started to argue with me on the phone and once i asked for her name she hung up on me and i had to call back to get her name and she continued to argue with me and then i asked for her district managers number and she continued to argue and told me to call the 800 number without giving it to me. i will never go to dominos again because of this experience. everyone should stay away from this place. from a once loyal customer which would order every week."}
{"text":"So, I called wondering where the delivery driver was after 40 minutes of waiting since my online order said the driver left, 10 minutes later he shows up with my cold pizza. To add insult to injury as my kids waited well past their bedtime for dinner, the cheesy bread wasn't even cut. Get it together, pizza pals. This experience was an abomination. I don't care if the driver had 5 orders with mine (which he only had 3), it only takes 40 minutes to drive from Henderson to Centennial Hills - so that 50 minute wait was far too long! Two stars was being generous."}
{"text":"Parking lot is tiny, you will hit someone trying to get in/out and drivers use the parking lot next door half the time when they're not supposed to. Service is pretty shit as well, slow and don't care about the customer, always in a rush to do deliveries and don't care about those doing carry out."}
{"text":"I love Monday's at Domino's because of 50% off gourmet pizzas!  Happy Family Day everyone so don't bother cooking up a storm and maximize some family time with quick takeout.  Can you believe what this Bad Boy pizza oven could churn out if it were in your own kitchen?  Stand back!"}
{"text":"omg i order a pizza ,wings and the bread bites at 5:50 and didn't receive my order til 730, when i tried to call them they wont pick up there phone,and when i went in there the manger had such a nasty attitude. I feel bad for the drivers,they lose tip because of this manger. Never again will i order from them if this manger is working . By the way her name is Latoya so dont order from her ,it doesn't matter she doesn't answer the phone to get orders."}
{"text":"We called in for an ETA of 35 mins. It has been over an hour. We called to check and was informed that the driver was coming straight to us, but it has again been over 20 mins. I am very disappointed in Domino's service.  Have been staring out the window for a while now.."}
{"text":"I originally gave them 5 Stars last year, but their management is atrocious. I attempted to call at 11pm (they closed at midnight & are directly across the street from my apartment complex, literally 2 mins away). They ignored my calls, so at 11:15 I placed an online order. These jokers had the nerve to take my money and NEVER bring my pizzas!! $27.00 worth of food ignored!   No worries, I'll be calling corporate, getting  my money back."}
{"text":"I just decided to order a pizza and change up the sauce to something different that I've never had before. I thought maybe it was just me but my friend didn't like it either. I've never done this before and I didn't want pizza to go to waste but I called up the pizza place and ask him if they would replace my pizza with a regular sauce.They did and I appreciate that so much. Because they did I'll probably order from them again soon. Thank you for your great customer service. Oh and the delivery guy was kind, that's always a bonus. Thank you Domino's!  The moral of the story is it they replaced the pizza with something that I like. Not everyone has the same taste buds I'm sure plenty of others like the other one so I'm not going to say what it is."}
{"text":"I was very disappointed. The food came two hours after I ordered two appetizers. The breadstick nuggets were hollow and burnt."}
{"text":"If I could choose no stars I would . I ordered a simple large pizza with a drink and was told it was going to take between 35-45 mins. After an hour and calling twice I still hadn't recieved my order. Jay was totally rude. Hung up on me the first time I called before I could ask how much longer it was going to take. and the second time I called gave me an attitude. Will never order again!!!!!"}
{"text":"My experience with dominoes is usually a positive one. I've ordered from many different locations in many different states. I didn't feel like leaving the house this evening so I decided to order takeout.   I ordered 2 oven sandwiches and 2 2-liters through the app. I use the app because I like the innovative idea of the tracker. So when my order completed it said it would be delivered by 6:12pm. There was a previous time where the app estimated an hour and thirty minuets delivery time so I called and that was due to insufficient drivers. That I can understand. I called at 7 pm to have the guy tell me it's out for delivery. I waited untill 7:30pm and called again to have a girl tell me it should be another 15 minuets it's out for delivery. 8:12 came around and they received a third call from me wondering where my order was and the same, \"it's out for delivery\" was the responce. I told the young lady that it's been over 2 hours since my order was placed and that I'd like to cancel my order. She continues to say it's out for delivery. All the while in the back ground her coworkers are in the back ground giving their two cents.   This experience will deter me from ordering from this location."}
{"text":"Ordered a pizza for delivery at 11:50pm  mobile app says the don't close until 1:00am. Google says the same thing I tried to call the store but had no luck and it is now 1:45am and I am just receiving my pizza almost 2 hours later and it's cold I had to microwave it. I asked the driver where was my drink that I ordered and he said oh I left it in the car and just stared at me. After a couple seconds of awkward silence he asked did I want him to go back down and get it out his car and I said yes of course. So I had cold pizza and a hot drink. This place is usually my go to pizza place but this is unacceptable. I plan on calling the manager when they open back up tomorrow.  Order#505329"}
{"text":"Pizza still tastes the same but the customer service is horrible. If I'm out and about I never go to this location (ONLY when I order in) because its the only one that I think delivers to my location. I have had issues with my order and they do nothing to rectify the problem. As stated before their customer service is a mess. Can't even call management, they never return calls."}
{"text":"Ok my daughter goes to MT island high school which is approximately 3 miles from the school and she stayed after school so I tried to order her a pizza her and her friends could have a little food... I was told even know I did this exactly 1 month ago that they don't deliver to a school unless it's a big order... then I was told that it's out of there range, now I live almost 8 miles from the store and that's in range... hmmm... needless to say I will not use the location again, there's times when these businesses can do what makes sense,,, but this location is not even considered doing what make sense... I'm very disappointed with this because the last manager I did this with had no problem doing this and now there a new manager and there's all kinds of problems and issues...you might win some but u just Lost 1..."}
{"text":"I discovered this Domino's Pizzas a while back tucked away inside a Sinclair/7-11 gas station and finally remembered to check it out. I placed an order online during the March Madness basketball games this weekend and was given a 14 min ETA. When I arrived at the store about 15 min later, my pizza was done as promised so I paid and was on my way back to continue watching basketball.   I ordered a medium Honolulu Hawaiian pan pizza and the 1st thing I noticed when holding the box was that it was a little heavier than usual. When I opened the box I was pleased to find a pizza that was covered in a generous amount of toppings that put other pizza chains to shame. Well that explains why the box was so heavy! Overall the pizza was tasty although some parts of the crust could've used a few more min of cook time since it still tasted a little doughy  This location is smaller and inside a gas station so only carry-out is available, no deliveries. They are running a special where you can get menu items for $5.99 each (including medium 2 topping pizzas) as long as you order 2 or more from that list"}
{"text":"Just a crappy location all around. They constantly put that damn garlic sauce on my pizza when I specifically ask them not too. Delivery takes forever also."}
{"text":"I wasn't thrilled with their new Specialty Chicken (bacon & tomato), but the BBQ wings & pepperoni pizza were great.  BTW, I received the specialty chicken for free through their Facebook page, so I didn't feel ripped off."}
{"text":"The order was more than the coupon said it would be and there was no explanation. No way to talk to anyone about it before paid.  Not happy!"}
{"text":"Wanted to place an additional order of wings and counter person went back to the back area to sit = crappy service. :("}
{"text":"Worth skipping a visit here.... I  grew up loving dominoes, but the pizza I got from here was far from classic dominoes pizza. Even the hot wings were bogus. Ask yourself, \"what are good hot wings?\" Are they hot, juicy, and smothered in sauce? or are they dry and just come with sauce in a packet on the side? If you answered the later, this place is for you. For me, I'll skip this place and go find me some classic pizza and wings"}
{"text":"I'm not usually a fast-food fan, and it's rare that I eat pizza, but when I do I want to make sure that the pizza place that I order from is not only quick service, but huge on customer service, and of course the pies have to be fantastic! The folks over here at this particular Domino's took huge care of me on a monster order of almost 14 pies! I called it in early, and they were ready to fly by 10:30 a.m. That says a lot about how much they take care of their customers. The pizzas are delicious and that goes without saying being Domino's, the tomato sauce is always got this beautiful flavor and they never disappoint!"}
{"text":"I've eaten here 2-3x's since moving in Nov. They are one of the best dominos I've ordered from!  Pizza is done (unlike others franchises), exactly how I ordered it, and looks neat...not like someone through stuff on it.  Thx Dominos!"}
{"text":"Placed an order to be delivered to a hotel. Delivery was 40 minutes late, 25 minutes after tracker showed it delivered and stone cold."}
{"text":"Worst hot wings we have ever had, Pizza was ok but not worth the price we just got back from Australia it was better there only good thing delivery was on time and the food was hot"}
{"text":"Never was a Domino's fan until they did their last reboot to their pizza. Gotta say I love it. Was confident in our closest Domino's (Blue Diamond) and their service, then we moved. Thankfully our new location is just as great. Great pizza and fast, courteous service.  Never an incorrect order. Also, I order online so not sure if that makes a difference."}
{"text":"I rarely order from dominos due to a low rate of quality in the past.  I decided to give them a second chance and still incredibly underwhelming.  Overpriced. The salad was literally something you could buy from the gas station.  The sandwich was dry, crusty and just a semblance of a sandwich.  The pizzas, now those were the real stars of the show.  A lack of sauce.  Overcooked, and the crust tasted like something out of the frozen section at Walmart.  Thanks again dominos for reminding me why the last time I ordered from you was over 18 months ago."}
{"text":"Always on time with your order; new store design is nice for customers. Oh, the pizzA is killer, especially the sauce - ALWAYS GET XTRASAUCE"}
{"text":"Apparently my order didn't go through online so when I got there they didn't know about it. I must have forgotten to confirm or something. The guy was very nice about it and took my order with the coupon I meant to use and put a rush on it. Thank you!!"}
{"text":"It's too hard for the people working there to put dipping sauces that you paid for through the app into your order. When you call to complain and they offer you a $2.50 credit for a future order, does that really solve anything? I don't want $2.50, I spend that in a millisecond, I want my dominos dipping sauces so that I can dip the cardboard tasteless pizza in something to give it flavor."}
{"text":"This particular franchise seems to produce significantly lower quality food compared to the other Dominos locations in town, and that's a shame for U of I students living nearby. The whole store is also small and terribly cramped, and the employees range from just mediocre to wholly incompetent."}
{"text":"Ordered online 11:30am Received confirmation email.  Tracker said Cory fired up the pizza.  Tracker showed no progress, attempted to refresh page. Could not pull up the tracker again. Online said there is no order attached to my phone number.  Called location 3 separate times, waited a total of 11min with no answer.  It is now 2:20pm and order never arrived.    Will no longer be ordering from here, ever."}
{"text":"Said 35 minute delivery 2 hours later still nothing tried calling and was on hold for over 30 minutes no one ever picked up Miranda was working won't be ordering from you guys again"}
{"text":"They never deliver on time  They don't make the pizza the way they  Advertise on tv.  They don't care at all about customer  So rude over the phone  If the manager ever come to my business  I will love to teach him customer service  And I will make him the shitty pizza  They make for there customer and make him eat"}
{"text":"Every experience at this Domino's has been a positive one! They're so affordable and their coupons are great! Yeaterday two friends and I split a large pizza, cheesy garlic bread, and dipping sauce for only $12 using their Monday 50% off special. This is the first I've heard of this discount so I'll definitely be returning on more Mondays! The cheesy garlic bread is the best you can get and the marinara sauce is delicious! I love that you can personalize the pizzas so much too with different sauces and lots of toppings. I would love it if they got a larger variety of vegetarian topping options!"}
{"text":"Wow I wanted a pizza really quickly and for cheap because it was late and I got a whole lot of loud yelling and thrashing about by a dude named Carl. He threatened to fire someone for something having to do with the register (seemed like a simple mistake) and then told the same guy he could keep him until midnight if he needed because he was 18 or older when he said he needed to leave for school the next day. Apparently this kid was supposed to be off at 9:30pm. Nope.  This same Carl guy was super condescending to everyone working and was making a ton of noise. He also yelled at someone while he was on the phone with a customer so I'm sure the customer was pissed, or at least deaf afterward.  The other people seemed nice enough and they were pretty quick at getting my food out so that saved them the last star before 1. Just don't go in when Carl is there unless you want a rude, loud voice in your ear for 30 minutes."}
{"text":"The best pan pizza I've had, we get from this location!! Not too greasy, just right! The staff are very friendly too!"}
{"text":"I literally hadn't considered them in years. I remember more recently that they made a big ad campaign on how they wanted to have pizza presented in a way that can be proud of. I finally decided to try them, and they've lived up to their promise. It's perfectly laid out and proportioned as you'd see in an ad, crust isn't too doughy, and it's not greasy. A solid buy for a quick and cheap option. It's still the very North Americanized approach and sugary tomato sauce you'd expect, but within that context they're doing well. Certainly better than Pizza Pizza, Little Caesar's, etc..."}
{"text":"Late night at work and who are you going to call? Domino's on the Plaza! This place has literally saved my life twice in the past month.  Our family eats dinner together EVERY night. With going to school, working fulltime and other last minute life obligations we sometimes order take out( still eat at the table).  The Good: I was notified by Facebook ad that domino's was offering 50% off online carryout orders and then seen a truck(in front of store) on my way home from work confirming it. In a pinch, we decided to try them out.  We ordered a large pepperoni and harbeno wings(spicy). I assumed it was just great because of the promo.  After a long day today, I decided to try them again. While on the way home, I attempted to order online from my phone(safely) and noticed cool deals for Monday- Thursday (Note: gives you an option to pay in store and online). When I walked in, I was immediately greeted by staff, (despite packed parking lot=someone's happy) my order was hot and ready to go. I will be back and if you are hungry and like pizza or wings the customer service here is worth giving them a try.   The other good: Caution area can be sketchy at night (despite parking lot with adequate lighting) and my tiny car was stuck in pothole in front of store. Pizza was hot and accurate, but I would like to have spinach or red onions as possible toppings."}
{"text":"If I could give this place a 0, I would. I waited over a damn hour for a delivery that,come to find out, never even got started! Garbage place! Enough said!"}
{"text":"I just read bad reviews on this store, But I always order online and my foods always awesome,gets here hot and it doesn't take long."}
{"text":"Great service, picked up a pizza with my boyfriend that we ordered ahead of time. Wiley rung us up with a coupon we didn't have or know about or even ask for. Just an all around good guy! And the pizza was yummy!!"}
{"text":"Tried this place/location for the first time. Just wanted to thank the cook Jonathan for practicing food safety and washing his hands before he handled the cash register and after. My son ordered a pizza and he did not have to ask this person to wash their hands after conducting cash register operations. Hope all employees are doing the same because Food Safety is a big plus and must. Thanks."}
{"text":"I ordered a pizza with the garlic creme sauce and this is what showed up. A huge bubble in the middle and no cheese."}
{"text":"Manager I talked to several months ago seemed like she could care less when I told her I just watched one of her delivery drivers drive over my landscaping rock between the sidewalk and street. Apparently the street wasn't wide enough to turn around in? Not cool man. Also told her that several months prior I watched one of her employees cut across everyone's yard while placing flyers on everyone's door. It's called a street and sidewalk, please use them! Suggested she try and reign her people in a little on this stuff."}
{"text":"We visited Dominos, almost every 2 days she. Their 50% pizzas were the deal. Great service, great food, great gluten free pizza! Every single experience was the same, quick, friendly and delicious service."}
{"text":"I order from here once or twice a month using the website and I've never had a problem. They're always on time (which is pretty quick) and the delivery guys are always friendly. My food is always hot and well-made, whether I order a sandwich, pasta or pizza. They send coupons and have deals often enough that it's typically one of the more cost-friendly pizza places around, too. Thumbs up, guys."}
{"text":"The first time i ordered from them, something went wrong, well all is forgiven now.  They got it together, and the last few experiences with Dominos have been rather enjoyable.  Now, I'm a fan of cold pizza in the morning so a little left over isnt a bad thing, at least not around my place.  But also i had to have the bacon barbecue chicken.  This is quite a nice addition when you are sitting around watching a hockey game with your friends.  Bacon makes everything better.  And who could forget the cinni-stix?  Not me.  I had to get them too.  Pizza and hockey.  There is no better combination :)"}
{"text":"Amazed anyone would prepare and deliever a pizza like the one we got. We're within walking distance of \"Little Italy\" and can't find a decent pie anywhere. We've tried them all but Domino's is the worst. Sure, it's a chain, but it should still be edible.  We ordered the large \"Exxtravaganza\" on thin crust and garlic fingers. Both were damn-near frozen and the pizza looked like it had been sitting out for days. Besides being burnt on the bottom, the toppings it did have were dried out, dead and basically plastic. Actual plastic would have tasted better and been more nourishing. One bite and the salt bomb was incredible, it's like they poured a salt shaker into the entire pizza to somehow flavor it. These people are morons. A family of four pizza fiends couldn't finish a single piece. How anyone would or could fuck up a pie so badly boggles the mind.  Congrats Dominos, you take the prize for shittiest pizza, ever."}
{"text":"We ordered this Monday night after a busy work day. Generally a fail safe, as you know what you're going to get. Not this time. I got my own pan pizza, which saved my boyfriend who got his own pizza, from being violently ill for 3 days. Im still feeling the stomach pain, although not the terrible twisting of death i was the days before. I phoned to inform them of what happened and of course, just as i thought, the person i spoke too did not care or say anything worth anything. I explained how I didn't want anything, just that they should probably know. They proceeded to tell me that i would need to see a doctor to prove what happened. I honestly do not care nearly enough to pay $10 for a doctors note to prove this. I am just warning other people that this was by far the most painful sick i have ever been in my life. Violently awful and lasted for days now. Please beware..."}
{"text":"Is it possible to give a place Zero stars????? Maybe it should be possible after you deal with this place.  I'm a huge fan of Domino's and it saddens me to give them such a horrible review.  I was in town for business for the second time this year. I ordered Domino's my first time there and I should have learned my lesson. It doesn't get any worse than this place. I ordered a small thin crust Buffalo Chicken Pizza and an hour and a half later comes the guy with my pizza. I kid you not, this pizza hadn't even been cut! A whole pizza without being cut. I called management and he said they would send a new pizza out. With it being 1100 already, I wasn't going to wait out for this new pizza. I left a note for it to be left outside the door of my hotel. I found it the next morning and this one had been cut at least.  Second time I ordered from them, I wanted to call it in, but when you call the number a recording answers urging you to use the app. After 5 minutes on hold and I never received an answer so I decide to use the app. I placed my order and my payment information, 3 minutes later I receive a call that they are not doing deliveries. It was 10:30 so I simply asked for a refund. Keep this refund in mind as the story continues.  I guess I kept hoping for something to change because I was so naive that I went back for a third time. I called in this time and they answered within the two minutes. I have her my order and then I asked to speak to the manager regarding my previous refund because it was still showing up on my card. I speak to the manager and she asked me what I ordered Sunday night? Mind you it's Thursday now.  Ummm I believe I ordered a steak and potatoes?! I ordered pizza ma'm PIZZA. I'm sorry if I can't remember what the exact order was. In the end, I just tell her I'll come see her the following day.  The pizza I ordered that night arrived after 45 min and my Buffalo Chicken pizza turned into Chicken and Cheese.  Instead of ruining domino's name, this franchise should consider closing."}
{"text":"Ugh pretty horrible. The food was standard if not below typical Domino's quality but the service and cleanliness could use a definite upgrade.   Maybe we were a little drunk and annoying, but everyone employed there was, like, dead in the eyes. I couldn't wait to get out of there."}
{"text":"Paid $20 for a very small, soggy, pizza that either had to be under cooked or wayyy old. I paid extra for spinach and garlic - there has to be at least a whole clove on each slice and i can only count about 6 spinach leaves on the whole pizza. The entire topping fell of as soon as i pick up the slice. And delivery took 45 mins at midnight.. i dont get it. So expensive and so disgusting. Pizza hut never pulled this sh*t with me"}
{"text":"Domino's has really stepped up their game in recent years but let's be real it's still Domino's. On a normal day I'm not really a fan but I LOVE this place when I'm depressed!"}
{"text":"Those who know me know I'm a sucker for Domino's! Thin crust mostly. Or hand-tossed with extra sauce (extra sauce is always free like the cilantro and onions are always free at Del Taco), or the new pan pizza. The specialty chicken is tasty and the wings (albeit smallish and peculiar) are oddly appealing. Domino's online ordering app is really easy to use and reliable. I love it all!  And this store is breaking *delivery records* to my house. Fastest time so far from a confirmed order-click on my Mac to a ringing doorbell is just under 20 minutes. I didn't think that was possible. That's fast as shit.  Keep it up guys. And your stock (DPZ) is on fire! Well deserved!"}
{"text":"Ordered a large pizza and breadsticks from here for lunch on a Sunday for the kids. Took longer than expected, which is understandable due to the location where we live. By the time we got the food, not blaming the driver, the food was completely over cooked! I was expecting moist pizza and breadstick like before, man was I disappointed this time. Completely lost faith in this branch of Dominos. Called to let them know for training purposes, no one picked up."}
{"text":"Worst food taste.. for the 4th time i am dissapointed from the food quality.. too bad its near my house but never've been disappointed this much.."}
{"text":"I come here ALLL the time and have been for the past 3 years. The staff is really nice and they genienly don't look like they hate their jobs or at least they're really good at hiding it. Other than having my pizza a little burnt, I haven't had any other  problems with this place so that's why I keep coming back! Their food taste really good every single time."}
{"text":"Hey it's Domino's Pizza, nothing special or outstanding to cal home about. I go here when the children wants some pizza and it's cheap. As for the adult palette you may want to venture elsewhere in Mount Holly or go to Gastonia because you won't find it here. The location is extremely small or cozy to my snobs out there and they do have a drive through which is helpful for those time when you don't want to get out of the car in the rain to get your pizza..  The workers are cool and accommodating. Again, I've been here quite often and the pizza is good for children, they like it and it's cheap. Can't say much else that you wouldn't figure out on your own."}
{"text":"This branch is not well train the employee. I order large pizza and they give me medium. They give me  Only the total amount of the pizza but not with the fee delivery ! Which I didn't know. For a large pizza that cost $21.00 plus tip so you ended up spending like $25.00 or more better go to a fancy restaurant. They are not worth it! They don't deserve a start! The whole point! Please don't order in this branch . They're so many other choices of pizza places out there so think before you spend your money ."}
{"text":"Wow!! Great NEW Dominos..... Truly needed on the Eastside. Ordered 4 pizzas for pick up & they were ready within 20 minutes.  Open kitchen, very clean & there were lots of employees hard at work. The guy at the counter was very nice, answered all my questions & even have us coupons for future use.   Looking forward to ordering again"}
{"text":"Recently had my weekly craving for some major carbs after a week of clean eating. I went online and Dominos had a coupon for 3 medium 3 topping pizzas for $21.99 which is a steal of a deal!  We ordered chicken and mushroom, hawaiian, and brooklyn pepperoni with shrooms and hot peppers.  All 3 pizzas were cooked within 15 minutes and they were hot, fresh, and super delicious!!!   Dominos is my go to cheap pizza.  I much prefer it over Pizza Pizza or Pizza Nova due to the fact that Dominos is always consistent, cheap, and they always get my order right."}
{"text":"This location is terrible! We placed an online at shortly after 8pm. The online tracker said our order had been checked by the manager and was ready to be delivered at 8:27 pm. It didn't arrive at our door until 9:20 pm. If that were the only issue, I wouldn't be writing this review.  I called the store to check on my delivery time and was given serious attitude from Aaron, the manager on duty. My food was done and was third in line to be delivered. I asked if it had been sitting there for the last 40 minutes. He said he didn't believe it had been that long. According to their own tracker it had been. He said they'd remake my food, but it would take even longer. No I'm sorry we're a little behind or I apologize, we have been very busy and will get it there ASAP. Also, the tracker online says that Aaron checked my food for quality and accuracy. Funny because I ordered no onion in my pasta and it was LOADED with onions. The other was supposed to be Carbonara with no onion or mushroom but came as just Alfredo.   We will not be ordering from this location ever again which means we most likely will not be eating a Domino's any time in the near future."}
{"text":"My favorite Dominos pizza it is always right and ready!! Staff is wonderfully nice! I miss managing back in my hayday!"}
{"text":"Love how you can easy it is to order pizza on their mobile app! Also if you do call sometimes they are to busy to answer. Also if you order on the mobile app you get points to get a free pizza. They have coupons already on the app. I love their $5.99 deal for pizza, wings & cheese bread!!!   Their wings are pretty good. I love their crust! The seasoning is amazing! Their cheese bread is so delicious as well, so cheesy & the seasoning on it is so good especially with garlic sauce. Yummy! They do have bone in and boneless wings but I love the bone in.   They do charge you for sauce and cheese & peppers as well.   I always check my order before I leave cause sometimes they get my order wrong or they are missing a sauce that I paid for.   They also deliver. But that usually takes long, like an hour. Also they are open to midnight which is pretty cool. Cause not a lot of places are open that late."}
{"text":"I've had pizza Delivered to my home from here many times! Last night was an example of pizza delivery perfection though. First, I love how you are able to see what phase your pizza delivery is in if you order online. My pizza was in my home less than 10 minutes after it left the restaurant! Also, this was my first time ordering a vegan pizza so I was nervous if it would be correct and it was! I ordered a thin crust (only vegan dough they carry) with no cheese and all the veggies my heart desired! (Which was almost all) the only downfall is it was about $25 for a pizza... I was feeling under the weather so it was worth it this time! Thanks dominos for my vegan pizza!"}
{"text":"I will not be ordering from this Dominos again. Last week I ordered from here and the pizza took an hour and when we received it it was lukewarm at best. Tonight when I ordered from here they told me they couldn't take my credit card because their machines were down. Strike three and they are out."}
{"text":"The worst Domion's location in the world!!! On more than one occasion we've placed an order for delivery. After 30 minutes passed we received a phone call stating they won't be able to deliver our order. We have three options (1) pick it up (2) wait two hours for a delivery driver (3) cancel your order. The young lady who called us never apologized for the inconvenience. I asked to speak with the manager. The manger proceeds to tell me \" it's not our fault\". Really then, who's fault would it be? It's extremely distasteful when management cannot take ownership for lack of leadership. Whatever is going on with the line cooks, ordering system, or delivery drivers; has nothing to do with me whatsoever. If I could give zero stars I absolutely would. Save your time, money, & energy and don't bother with this location."}
{"text":"Is this serious Dominos? The entire pizza is a bubble?! No sauce, cheese or toppings on 2/3 of the pizza. Where is your quality check? Don't have the time to wait for them to recook a better pie, frustrating."}
{"text":"I placed my order for carry out and drove there. They didn't make it. The girl said she called me twice. She didn't. They were out of ingredients. There are a lot of options in the area that are better anyway. One of those places will be getting my business instead. I chose convenience and I guess that was wrong. Glad I didn't pay up front online at least."}
{"text":"I've had the same issues everyone else has had on these reviews and that's the deliveries. Zero accountability, zero effort, waited around 40 minutes from when the tracker said he left dominos only to find out it wasn't coming, and I had to call THEM to find out this information....if you place a delivery ask them NOT to send Frank. The guy doesn't know how to deliver food to save his life, which makes me wonder why he's a delivery driver at this pizza place. Instead go to pizza on 40th. It's local and the family that owns this place actually know how to run a business, and the delivery driver is great."}
{"text":"Quick. Tasty. Cheap. Three very good words to describe Dominos pizza. I much prefer it over Pizza Nova or Pizza Pizza.  This location is always accurate with my order and the delivery is spot on. It always comes hot and fresh!  My favorite pizza to get is chicken and mushroom, hawaiian, and brooklyn pepperoni with mushroom.  So good no matter what!"}
{"text":"I thought with new management that some of the old issues would change. They continue to skimp on ingredients, flavor, and time. I don't normally like to order out from chain restaurants, but hubby got to the phone quicker than I did. Ordered the mediteranean veggie hoagie (which, I was originally happy about the fact that the bread and veggies were vegan friendly without ordering cheese). The hoagie was incredibly small (hubs thought we could share), but that aside.. there was nothing on it! Maybe 4 spinach leaves, a couple sliced roasted red peppers and a couple slices of pickled banana peppers. That's it. My father-in-law got a meat hoagie, same size - two, for $18! I should've taken a photo, but at the time I was too hangry. I'd call the manager, but last time they wanted us to drive our food back to the shop to see what was wrong with it! HA!!!!"}
{"text":"This place is the worst. I can understand that things happen and drivers get lost but management needs some training in customer service. I waited two hours after being told one. I also called at the hour and a half point and was told that it was out for delivery. When i called back 20 mins later to see what happened the manager told me that the driver got lost. Did i still want it. Yes please...  So i paid full price (after requesting a discount) for really cold hard pizza without the soda that was on the order. I called back and told her that if i had been told that they were out of coke i would have asked for a different drink. Her reply..... I didnt even know that you needed a soda. And this was the manager. Never again. And i have never left a bad review"}
{"text":"I would give this place 0 stars if it was possible.  I placed an order at 11:52 - it said it would take 22-32 minutes to be delivered. At 1:25, the order did still had not shown up.  I called to check and the person on the phone was not only rude but hung up on me.  When I called back, they said they did not see a point in conversing any further.  I would not suggest ordering from this place.  There are plenty of other pizza places in the city with better service, better pizza, and cheaper prices."}
{"text":"i order bcuz its cheap... never had a problem with delivery time but they ALWAYS forget my sauce... i always order thru the app so idk if that has something to do with it"}
{"text":"Man, does this place suck. TRUST THE REVIEWS! I ignored the negative ratings, and that was a mistake. I ordered a large pepperoni and pineapple pizza with EXTRA sauce. What I got: Large pizza half pepperoni and half ham & pineapple with \"easy\" sauce?? This place is a joke. Drive to a different one - it's worth the gas."}
{"text":"We've been ordering from this location for years, since we've moved to our new apartment downtown we have been having issues. When I called after reaching an hour wait after I was alerted that our order was out for delivery I was told that our driver called multiple times when I never received any calls. This last time we even stood outside and waited and no one showed up. When I called to inquire where our order was the manager Luis again told me the driver called three times. When I told him that I had my phone in my hand the entire time and had not one missed call, even confirming the correct number since I did recieve a call that the order was out for delivery, he responded very condescendingly implying that I was lying. Due to our past poor experiences we will be ordering from pizza hut or grand ave pizza both of which have never had an issue delivering our pizzas."}
{"text":"Domino's has improved dramatically over the past couple of years.  The Handmade pan pizza is really at or near the top of the pizza chain pyramid.  I agree the wings need some work, but the stuffed cheezy bread is a great side."}
{"text":"Had the sandwich for lunch yesterday. Was such a sad looking sandwich.   The top and bottom bread touched each other from lack of ingredients and was SO SKIMPY. Tasted yummy but bread alone does not make a sandwich.  Everything we got from here TASTED good but the serious skimping on ingredients is a bit frustrating especially when you're not getting what you paid for."}
{"text":"Fast service, good pizza, friendly drivers.   Whenever I really want some pizza, this Domino's is my go-to. Their location is right down the street from my house, and they usually get my order to me within 30 minutes. Their drivers are friendly and competent folks, who are good at their job. I've never had a problem with them finding my place.   In terms of food, this Domino's is constantly running specials (coupons and online), which make it easier to come back because you'll save a bit of money when you order. I have always been impressed with the quality and freshness of my orders from this location. Pizza and wings are always a good choice, but so is the chicken parmesan sandwich (my favorite).   I'll gladly order from this Domino's location in the future. 4-stars!"}
{"text":"Got into town late and so pizza delivery was our only choice.  Because my wife is gluten free and we knew Domino's offers gluten free, we chose them.  Called them at 10:30 PM with our order, they said 30 minutes to an hour for delivery.  When no one had shown up by 11:45, I called and they said the driver had just walked out the door and would be there in a couple of minutes.  I called again at midnight and the person did seem baffled that the driver wasn't there so she would look it into it and get back to me.  A couple minutes later, the driver showed up at our door, basically threw the pizzas at me and took off.  As she was leaving I looked at the pizzas and both were wrong.  I called the store and she said to hold on and she would try to catch the driver.  She got back to me a couple minutes later saying the driver is gone and she gave our pizzas to someone else, then she offered to make me the pizzas we ordered.  At this point I was fed up, I had 2 pizzas that I didn't want (and my wife couldn't eat because neither of them were gluten free) so I told them I wanted my money back.  They did credit us back and then say we can get a free coupon for the next time we order from them but I really don't foresee us ordering from this particular location (especially since we were visiting the Phoenix area) anytime soon."}
{"text":"If you would be asked me to review this business last year, I would be given it 5 stars. But lately, the drivers have been going slow (I live 10 minutes from Dominos and it's been taking the drivers almost 30 to 45 minutes to deliver food to Fairport), the orders are wrong (I got a chicken park sandwich and a chicken Alfredo in a dish and they gave me a bread bowl instead.) This place is going downhill and fast. I'm going to start thinking twice before ordering from them again."}
{"text":"The service is awesome and very good pizza. I will order again. The employees know how to treat the costumer right I don't know why people complain of Dominos."}
{"text":"Family doesn't really eat Dominos. However, got this pizza for the kids. They should be ashamed of the way they made and delivered this pizza. We'll be sure to stay away from this location on Camino Al Norte in the future."}
{"text":"Their pizza, cheese bread and boneless chicken are tasty and delivery service is outstanding. Good specialty pizzas too.  However, their online ordering is a pain because you cannot see any prices on their menu except from the checkout cart. And recently their prices have increased a lot. As in, some items went up by several dollars overnight. Don't order the bone-in wings."}
{"text":"Truly a fine dining experience.  In three years I have eaten over six hundred time and they have only screwed up the order about 10 times.  The only time they served me a Bbq chicken pizza that looked like an alcoholic's vomit, but they made it right by offering me a free pizza.  Very courteous and classy place.  Would not recommend eating there as there are no tables.  There is a nice wooded area only 30 seconds walking distance if you need some shade while eating outside.  Wear shoes because you might get stabbed with a needle or knife from a criminal.  Be aware of your surroundings no matter where you are."}
{"text":"This place on Centre St, for the 2nd time in our ordering history has nailed it - for the good. Never an error in ordering on line, always friendly deliverymen and most importantly, the food tastes great! Reasonably priced for a chain store. We always get a medium or small  ( for 2 people) with the 10 wings. The wings believe it or not are the best ever! We get them 'hot' (they also have BBQ and honey garlic) and I just want to slather my slice of pizza all over the leftover hot sauce at the bottom of the tin foil. That is another thing, the staff wrap them up so well that the wings are piping hot when the order gets to your house. The pizza ingredients are fresh, nice big pieces of onion and ham, fresh NOT canned mushrooms. We always share a little lava cake from there too for $1.99 as a treat. TO DIE FOR! I give this place a 2 thumbs up, 5 stars as there is no reason why not to."}
{"text":"You know what's awesome? Is when you order a pizza , for delivery 1 hour and 15 minutes before closing time... And they never show up. Literally, fuck you. We are starving, ordered in plenty of time, are excellent tippers... We don't even like domino's , but after a long day , we figured what the hell. They work hard and are open. NB it you never showed up. Fuck you. Forget about me going hungry.. but my fiancee? Who works 13 hour days 6 days a week... Just fuck you. We are so easy we ask for nothing. We ordered a pizza from a pizza delivery, eBay never showed. And now we are going to bed , hungry. This is America. And we have E life money tonight, to spend on your disgusting pizza, because you were open. I paid, you never showed . What in the actual fuck?"}
{"text":"Never a bad experience in the 3 plus years I have ordered from here. Nice when you are in a hurry and absolutely love the pizza tracker (not sure more places don't do this). Sure it's a chain, but I enjoy the pizza, the prices, and the service. Thank you Dominos!"}
{"text":"No no no Gave this place 2x to get it right! First time ordered specialty pizza, regular salad and tiramisu cup-after waiting 45 minutes from the time pizza left store ( you can see when online as is tracked)-pizza came freezing, gave me a Caesar salad which I hate and the lettuce was brown, quality of the chicken sucked as was mush, and forgot my desert, also wrong dressing. Informed Sandy at store offered future credit. Fine. Second attempt was tonight.... Wings, pizza, sandwich desert, and salad...$11 additional over credit, ok. Told 20-30 minutes. 40 minutes later, pizza ( not thin crust as ordered), wings (not boneless as ordered), sandwich-which by the way is NOTHING like shown on website-supposed to come with banana and green peppers-there was a1/2 of each on the sandwich, NO desert and AGAIN the crappy Caesar. This was the order that could make things right? Driver had \"boss\" in the car who exemplified clueless. I denied a redelivery as it was 920pm and they promised 10 minutes- its 952pm-seriously why did I even believe them. Shame on me once, shame on me twice-3x??? Too many other choices-Marcos, Pappa Johns, and other independents. Prime example of why Dominos is no longer King or my choice for that matter."}
{"text":"I have ordered pizza from this store many times, but I had it. They have gotten the wrong topics on the past, but at least we liked the ones they placed, so no big deal. However; we ordered several garlic sauces with each order and they forget them. They have offered to send them, but who wants to wait? I have actually called once to follow up with my order to ensure they don't forget it and it worked that once. No quality control, Jasmin the Manager did apologized, but They continue to get it wrong. I just got my order and asked the driver it my sauces were inside, he stated yes. My bad again for not checking, but what difference would of made, wait for them to return? NOT! See ya!!!"}
{"text":"Love the food. People are exactly what you SHOULD expect at a domino's. Don't know why everyone is complaining about the service. It is a cheap pizza place after all."}
{"text":"called and made an order for one pizza, pick-up... we live right around the corner, I'm not feeling good, my husband just busted his ass @ work all day and was nice enough to go pick up the pizza since I wasn't feeling well. the person on the phone says 15 mins; my husband left in 10 mins, shows up and the guy made it, but forgot to put it in oven? give me a damn break people, get it together...  they offered us free soda. eh, thanks, but we just stopped drinking soda. would have just been nice to have my food cooked and done on time instead of just sitting at the end of the oven for 10+ minutes, making my husband stand there waiting longer... amateurs...."}
{"text":"Ordered a pizza from the dominos on Apache Blvd in Tempe, AZ yesterday, got it home, and there was NO CHEESE on it. I thought there was some until I looked at it and realized that was the CRUST I could see between the drizzles of sauce, not cheese. I'll never order from there again. Who does that?  Dominos on Apache Blvd in Tempe, AZ, apparently."}
{"text":"Will never order from this dominos. I usually love dominos pizza but the past 4 times ive order at this location the pizza has been undercooked (to the point its still  pizza dough) last time i finally called them and all the girl on the other end could say is \"we go by the timer\"..."}
{"text":"If it had been possible to give zero stars, I would have. ordered their hand made pan pizza. Complete and utter rubbish.  Raw uncooked dough in the middle.  Bland, boring and pathetic toppings.  VItos is close.  Momma Spinnys is close.  Why did I fall for the advert and believe Dominoes might, possibly, produce an edible pizza"}
{"text":"ordered a pizza and very specifically asked for no onions and there is onions all over this pizza. I don't know how much clearer I could've said no onions. not going to bother having another sent out because we're so hungry."}
{"text":"Get pizza here sometimes but have to go get it because they are out of my delivery area what can I say its domino's it is a staple pizza and the New sauce change has improved it and they have  chocolate lava cake which is a fav of mine"}
{"text":"Always the go to pizza place in town. It's nice and convenient to have a good pizza place so close to the school. It doesn't matter if it's their wings, the pasta bowls, or the pizza whatever you're in the mood for they got It."}
{"text":"Price is right, but food quality is blahhhhhh.  I succumbed to the TV advertising and went to try again.  I was disappointed.  I got a large 3 topping hand tossed pizza.  Crust was crappy, sauce was crappy, and toppings were OK but sparse.  I would rather pay a higher price and get a better pizza.  I also got  16 piece box of boneless chicken too.  That was pretty horrible -- just dry pieces of breast meat breaded and fried.  Very dry and even though the breading was seasoned, it still was crummy tasting.  I think it would have been better with batter instead of breading.  Oh well, you get what you pay for.  These days, all pizza is not worth the money.  For approximately the same price, you can get a full meal at other restaurants.  The only saving grace to pizza is that it is finger and convenience food. But that is about it."}
{"text":"The only reason I gave one star was because the food is good only if u order extra sauce for the pasta dish. I had ordered there for delivery for some time, but the one time I walked in I told them I would never come back. They never washed their hands and they never clean up. I work around food myself and I would never do what they do #needgloves. Corporate needs to train management. Im surprised I'm not to sick from delivery"}
{"text":"HORRIBLE service. This is twice now we've had a terrible experience. The first time, they un hooked the phones so we couldn't even call and follow up on our order. We had to drive to the store where we were told they were having \"technical difficulties\". The second time,  we waited over an hour, again. When I called to follow up, I stayed on hold for over 5 minutes and was told our driver was on her way. We continued to wait another 20 minutes. OUR PIZZA WAS COLD!!! Do NOT order from this store."}
{"text":"This location is a disaster!! I order on a regular basis and EVERY TIME they mess up the order and do NOTHING to make it right. Tonight I spoke with the manager who I have spoken to many times in the past and he tried to blame the issue on me even though I added a note to my online order and called to ensure that they did not forget the sauce I ordered. He did nothing!! I will never order Dominoes again!! Horrible customer service."}
{"text":"Every once in a while I love to remind myself as to why I don't order delivery from chain pizza places like Domino's, Pizza Hut, Papa John's, etc. sometimes I'm pleasantly surprised and tonight I was not.   Over an hour and a half delivery time and I received a soggy medium pan pizza. But what had me most concerned is that my pizza was pulled out of the oven and checked at 6:35ish and was sitting there for over 45 min before it left the store.   After delivery fees and tips for $16 I recommend eating a frozen pizza because at least you can pull it out when it's actually done baking. Me, didn't have access to an oven. Otherwise I know what I would've done. Baked a pizza."}
{"text":"We ordered a pizza online 3 plus hours ago. We had to call them 5 times. They said they tried to deliver it twice and couldn't find our address. We submitted it online, duh. A driver finally called and said he was by our pool. Our pool area is locked. He couldn't describe our clubhouse. I repeated my address multiple times on each call. He asked if we spoke Spanish. I could barely understand him. I even drove to my clubhouse to find him. There wasn't anyone there. So evidently he went back to the store again after telling me he'd be here in 5 minutes. The store is only about 2 miles away. The last time we called we asked for a manager and the kid said he said he could do the same as a manager. Then we were put on hold for 10 minutes. Stay away from this place!"}
{"text":"Walked in to an empty dominos.  I was Asked if it was for pick up and said yes.  The worker asked me for a minute which wasn't an issue.  I waited almost 10 minutes until I realized she was gone.  Upset I went to the counter again.  A different worker assisted me and said he didn't know where  the other employee went.  My pizza wasn't getting hotter on the cooling rack.  I hate this location."}
{"text":"I ordered online for my first time, forgot to select tomato sauce and they the unsociable employee refused to help me out and make another and was rude about it, when I spend tons of money there weekly between my family and they can't remake a medium pizza with sauce makes me very upset. so they just lost our business this is not how you treat loyal customers 1/31 4.00pm"}
{"text":"The customer service at this location SUCKS!!! I ordered online and it said my order will be ready in APPROXIMATELY 13-18min. I purposely ordered online so I can make it to a party in time. When I got there, the young Hispanic cashier told me they haven't started the order and would take 15-20 minutes.  I chuckled and mentioned it should have been done already and he just shrugged his shoulders and said \"wait\".  Train your employees better.   Oh and train them to pick up the phone on the FIRST RING!!! They let the phones ring in there atleast 10 times!!  The guy making the pizzas was using BARE HANDS! This is not sanitary and would NEVER pass health inspection"}
{"text":"Probably the last time I will be ordering from here...according to the app, delivery should be within 30 min. According to the app tracker my order wasn't even in the OVEN in 30 minutes. This restaurant has become consistent with over an hour for delivery.  Quality compared to other Dominos is not worth my time. Dominos shouldn't even call this location a Dominos..."}
{"text":"I order both delivery and pickup from this domino's! they're always fast and orders are accurate. People are more eager to leave bad reviews than good ones, so thats not fair. Im very happy and I've never had an issue!!"}
{"text":"The pizza is great as always. The timing was alllll bad. First of all I ordered at 6:16 and told it would be 35-41 min for pick up! Should have canceled then. But I stuck it out cuz we get dominos pizza every Friday night (sometimes alternate with Chinese but this is our go to). So I wait. And I wait. And I wait. And I'm early so I wait. I see them making and putting aside soooo many pizzas for people who are not there. Why not find out who is there and make pizza that way perhaps? But fine. So eventually after 40 minutes I get the email track your pizza thing that says ok your order is ready! I go in the store and the tv says Jenna your order is ready! Fantastic I think to myself. But no. One pizza is ready and the other is not, they explain to me that the timing system I see is not accurate bc \"they are behind, super swamped, we have lots of new people and there have been lots of mistakes.\" What?! So fine. I've already been here 44 minutes, I'll die before I leave. So then after I tell the cashier repaeatedly how upset I am that the timing system of dominos tells me im ready and it's really not and I'm mad guess what? Finally it's ready! Thank Mary, Joseph and Jesus. So I grab it and go home and tell my family I'm finally here after an hour please eat. Oh...wait... they got my order wrong. I ordered one meat lovers pizza and one double cheese and I have received...two double cheese no meat for the boys and men in my family. Insert super mad red face with smoke blowing out of my ears. So I call. And explain the person who answered said let me get my manger. Great. She gets on and says no problem we will remake it for free. Come get it whenever you are ready. I feed my unhappy family cheese pizza, go retrieve the pre-ordered pizza and get it and get home one hour and fifteen minutes after the intitial pizza order and that's right you totally guessed it! The meat lovers pizza was stone cold! Bc it was ready and there when I initially was ready to pick up- I'm guessing they misplaced it due to the consistency of the pizza. Chinese place wins my business from now on. Bye dominos. So sad bc the pizza is great, staff? Not so great."}
{"text":"So my hubby went out tonight to grab some pizza and when I woke up grabbed a slice after I finished my slice I could see a nasty squiggly black hair (looks pubic to me) right on the edge of my pizza. GROSS! Just uploaded a picture of it. By the way this hair could not possibly be mine I have purple hair and my husband has black hair but he has been wearing a hat all night."}
{"text":"Great pizza and service. They were already half way thru with cooking a pizza for me, and I suddenly called to change it and they were happy to help and hangs my order! Very nice!"}
{"text":"Honestly, Domino's has really stepped it up! Not only am I just extremely satisfied with their new menu, but I swear they have the fastest service I have ever experienced from any delivery pizza place, and this goes for all domino's I have ordered from.   However I wanted to talk about an experience I had 2 nights ago so please keep reading, I tried to place an order last minute before they closed, it was probably around 12:50am knowing they close at 1am. However my order didn't process for whatever reason, I called no answer. I figured the store probably closed early no big deal, that's what I get for waiting until the last minute.  Well last I get a late night craving again the next night, and decide to try and re order the same thing (This time an hour before close just to make sure I get it this time) Well I get a call 10 minutes later and it's the store manager, she goes on to tell me she remembered my address from trying to order the previous night just before close, and told me my entire order tonight was on them! I was shocked, they certainly did not have to do that, I really appreciate the service at this location, and such a kind gesture. if anyone has any problems, before placing a review, just give them a call! I am sure they will go the extra mile to take care of you like they did for me without even asking. Thank you so much domino's! It's little things like this, that keeps customers coming back."}
{"text":"I read the reviews on here and wanted to give them the benefit of the doubt. They forgot my soda and had to come back. It took them an extra 20 minutes and my soda was warm. They also forgot my extra sides I ordered. Won't be ordering from here anymore."}
{"text":"Best CUSTOMER SERVICE EVER! James and Vernique make sure all their customers are satisfied. Love them!"}
{"text":"Worst pasta I ever ate at dominos, I love carbonara that dominos makes but here it was dry and shitty. I also ordered parm bites which are soggy and there is not enough seasoning on them and obviously there is no Parmesan cheese also on them . Never go this dominos."}
{"text":"Terrible delivery service. Waited an obscene amount of time and when I called to check on my order, my order was still there and the manager replied \"oh I don't know why it's here\". Thankfully, I got a refund. You're better off doing carry out."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and  I decided to test out the new and improved \"Dominos\" from all their new TV commercials. I must say I was pleasantly surprised that the pizza actually does taste better!  Maybe I'm bias because of the this particular Dominos pizza location. I ordered my pizza and it was delivered in 30 minutes. The drivers are super friendly and an overall good experience.   I actually signed up on Yelp just to write a  good review on how nice they are. Will be ordering from here again."}
{"text":"I should ask for a refund. I made an oline order at 8:00, the online tracker said it was out for delivery at 8:38 cool my food is going to be here soon since I live close by. It was 9:26 and I called the store asking where my pizza was since it's been over an hour. The girl over the phone told me the delivery person was close by.  The delivery girl called me asking where my apartment was, I went outside met her and I shouldnt have tipped her because she was late, bitchy, and my food was cold and nasty. Seriously I've never had bad delivery in my life! This was the first time a pizza company fucked up so bad. Get your shit together dominos!"}
{"text":"Horrible customer service. Upon entering, the disgruntled employee without a hello, smile, or greeting asks the senior citizen \"Do you want to order? \" The senior continues to inquire about prices to which the employee seems annoyed. Then the senior says he would like to order but wanted to know how much large pizzas were since he couldn't read the menu.  The employee snaps back a response with \"Do you want to order? I'm busy.\" Too late. The senior was going to place an order for 10 large pizzas for a gathering at church but walked out after such a disrespectful encounter.  Always treat a customer as though you want them to return."}
{"text":"Most ridiculous pizza experience of my life. My dead grandmother could've cook this pizza and delivered it faster than this company. Order the pizza at 2:13 AM And received it around for 18 cold. I ordered garlic sauce with the pizza for two dollars and didn't even get it. I am a college student. Very annoying. Happy to say the dominoes will not be getting my service anytime ever again."}
{"text":"I ordered pizza from this dominos last night (10/29) at 12:45am. So once 1:15 hit and no pizza I called the store and they were already closed. So no pizza ,no call nothing but they did charge my card the $31.36 for the pizza I never received. So I called tonight to see what had happened and the explanation I got from Nick the \"manager\" was that \"oh someone canceled the order on our end your money will be refunded in a few days\". He didn't apologize try to fix it or figure out what happened. Horrible customer service."}
{"text":"OK. So......in October, after quite a few times trying to order thru an obvious language barrier ( see previous review).....I gave this place a 1 star review and explained why........then I avoided the place for several months......well, I have gone back 4 times recently and did not update my review immediately, because I wanted to be sure......but.....tonight (Easter Sunday) I returned for the 5th time since my review.....(ya, we had pizza on Easter because I think Ham is disgusting lol )......anyway, tonight I decided to update my review......It seems to me, I am quite sure, they have corrected the language problem.......my last 5 visits I ordered with a person who spoke perfect English.....btw, tonight a very extremely nice young dude took my order....he was exceptionally nice and personable.....as everyone has been, these last few visits..... I'm so glad this place got straightened out.......it was really ridiculous."}
{"text":"Ordered 2 medium 2 topping pizzas and a salad at 3:43pm and it didn't get here till get here until 5:20pm! No call that they are running late, pizza was really cold..barely any sauce on it.. Family not happy at all!!! MOST LIKEY WILL NOT BE ORDERING AGAIN!!!"}
{"text":"My friends and I went in on an online deal Dominos had and it was so worth it. I know, I know, it's only Domino's but this pizza was soooooo delicious and the delivery guy was fast and nice."}
{"text":"Called there January 2nd to place a delivery order around 2:30pm and the guy rudely picked up and said they were closed. I found thid really weird knowing Dominos isn't supposed to have different opening hours usually. So my girlfriend decided to place an order online, to see if they would make it. AND THEY DID!!! 30 minutes later they were at my door, and the restaurant really wasn't closed at all. Happened to me again last summer, when I came in 40 minutes before they closed and they told me they were already closed. I think employees at this Dominos are just especially lazy and rude."}
{"text":"Super fast prep and delivery. We ordered our food online, watched the tracker (very funny) and had it within 22 minutes. Granted, we live close and it was 9pm on a Sunday but I'm still impressed.   Food was exactly what you expect from Dominos. Awesome cheesy pizza, drink order was still ice cold when delivered, and they remembered to include all sauces (usually the item left behind!). Will order again."}
{"text":"This dominos is a joke. Made an online order and SPECIFICALLY asked the driver to call or text me when he arrived because my wife was sleeping. Not only did he ring the doorbell, he rang it three times only for me to open the door with him yawning in my face and handed me a cheesy bread that didn't have either of the sauces I paid extra for."}
{"text":"Ordered only 1 medium pizza online. When it got delivered, the pizza was cold and looked like it been sitting. Also, the driver was standing outside the door, didn't call or anything."}
{"text":"Pizza hardly had any cheese, thanks a lot Miranda. The one on Apache is better than this"}
{"text":"I typically order online as the app is convenient and gets the job done. Theres always specials going on but theyre not amazing usually.   I feel that the pizza sizes at Dominos are smaller than other places like Pizza Pizza or Reginos, cause my family doesnt get full from Dominos compared to Reginos with the same order.   The waittime isnt bad; 15mins is usually the norm. First time, I ordered a dipping sauce and they put it in the pizza box. Second time, I thought they did the same thing but in turns out they didnt put any dipping sauce in or mentioned anything!! Ill admit its partly my fault for not checking but I didnt know itd be inconsistent. Third time (yesterday), same thing happened except I bothered to ask where the dipping sauce I paid for was, and they forgot to put it with the pizza... even though its written in the online order?   The pizza tastes fine, but its not filling. Its not my first choice for pizza."}
{"text":"I've ordered from this location several times because it's close to my work. There's been a sharp decline in service. A few months ago I ordered and accidentally gave them the wrong address. Totally my bad. The driver called, I apologized profusely, his entire delay was maybe 10 minutes and I grabbed an extra ten from my purse to compensate him for his time and trouble. When he arrived, he began screaming and yelling at me, calling me \"stupid\" in front of an office full of coworkers. I totally get being frustrated, I screwed up. I don't understand screaming and yelling at the top of your lungs because someone reversed a couple of numbers while typing in an address. It was unprofessional and upsetting. Today I ordered pizza to arrive at a certain time and it was nearly an hour late. I also found out that they no longer give complimentary parmesan and red chilis, but that they will sell them to you. Huh? Kinda over Domino's, especially this location. Wish I could order online from another store. I just don't think these guys care about getting it right."}
{"text":"I ordered a thin crust pepperoni pizza yesterday along with some other items. I had it delivered. When I opened the box, to my surprise, the pizza looked as if it were shaken up and down for 5 minutes. Pieces on top of each other and cheese everywhere in the box. Be wary of ordering from this location. I'm a big fan of Dominos, but stay away from this location..."}
{"text":"i'm a fan of dominos, they're fast, u can order online, and the food i have gotten has always been great. i got the pan pizza, 14 plain wings, and cinnastix. satisfied all around :)"}
{"text":"The spinach & feta specialty pizza is the bomb!  I love it.  So good.  Once you create an account on-line you get coupons and an easy re-order choice."}
{"text":"The pizza is good, the wings are good, everything about Dominos is good. The price is so low, you get enough food for $30 to feed my family for days. The orders are always accurate and arrive warm and ready to eat. No complains and I've made some $$$ on their stock too!"}
{"text":"Clean store with friendly employees. I've had several pizza's from here & all have been very good. Their delivery service is excellent as well. They use quality ingredients on my pizza's which is very important to me. The fantastic prices I can order a pizza & not break the bank."}
{"text":"did the online order from hotel - awesome delivery and pizzas - great job guys.  i will definitely order this way more often"}
{"text":"Shared some Domino's Pizza with the residents of Mercy House on 4/17/2018...Delivered hot and fresh...can't believe I waited so long...Big Shout Out to Amber and the staff!"}
{"text":"Their online ordering system is great! They have great deals, and the food has always been as-ordered and on time. MUCH better than some other chains around here."}
{"text":"Ordered $50 worth of pizza at 5:55. Called the store to check on progress at 6:45. They said 20-30 more minutes. Received a hang-up call from the store around 7:30. Checked online for the order status. Received an error about the order not existing. Called the store. Was told my house is out of the delivery area. Asked where my pizzas were, since they were being prepared before, and was told that they would not make or deliver them. Talked to the manager; said my order \"should have been transferred\" to another store (South Tryon St.), to whom I have never spoken. Asked him to refund my money, and he said he cannot. He called the other store. They said they could not. He said \"sorry,\" and gave me his manager's number to call tomorrow.  I will be disputing the charge on my credit card and I will never order Domino's Pizza again."}
{"text":"If I could give this dominos a lower score I would. We received a cold uncooked pizza that took 2 hours to get! I'm not sure as to what there policy is but we still haven't received just do!! I'm done"}
{"text":"Domino's has come a long way. We ordered pan pizza from them Sunday evening and it was the best pizza we've had in some time. Generally we order from small independent places but this rivaled anything out there. Very Very Very good!"}
{"text":"DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME!!! GET ANOTHER PIZZA PLACE INSTEAD!!!!  Placed an online order and was quoted 25 to 35 minutes. At the 55 minute mark after placing my order I called to follow up on the order. The idiot that picked up the phone said my order was placed at 8:50pm and it was delivered at 9:06pm. WTF!! That means they flew my order to me before cooking it. I explained the order is not here and the tracker showed it left their store at 9:06pm.  She said I could wait or call back to find out what happened to my order cause she doesn't have it. I asked if the drive didn't have a phone so they can call and find out the status (like many other dominos have done for me before). This idiot said he does but she is not going to call her driver since he is on the road. Wtf!! Never heard of bluetooth?!?! Then she went on to say that they are the second busiest store in Vegas and that issues happen!!! Really then maybe you need to adjust your damn tracker if you are that busy. This way your customer have an expected delivery time that is actually correct and there are no excuses as to why you can't do your job on time.  We finally got our food and as expected it was like warm. You could tell it had been the vehicle for a long time due to condensation on the packages. Worst experience ever!! And rude employees!!!"}
{"text":"This Domino's location is very convenient because it's located on Vista Del Sol and they also accept m&g. Every time that I have used their app to order right now or order in the future I have always gotten my pizza on time and with the correct ingredients. The wait time does get long when there are large groups of students ordering for big club events and such but the wait time is typically very short. The pizza is good for a snack at night if you're at ASU but apart from that it's just a normal Domino's."}
{"text":"This used to be an excellent location but since Amanda has been the manager it has been atrocious!  I was told by Amanda not to order on super bowl Sunday because they were too busy and it would take 2 hours to be delivered?  Why would a manager dissuade people from ordering?  Today my order took an hour and a half, they didn't have my drink in stock and Amanda says she's sorry but offers no solutions.  I live less than 1/2 a mile from location but the driver decided to take the other order first which is at least 20 minutes away, even though mine was on the way.  Delivery time said 36 minutes max but I called an hour after order and it hadn't left yet...  Very disappointing as this location was amazing!  Guess Pizza Hut will be getting my business from now on!"}
{"text":"I like Dominos, the pizza has a garlic spray on the outside and they deliver fast. I order from here all the time ans its really good quality, better than papa Johns in my opinion. The only reason this isnt a 5 star review is that I called them and the guy who answered the phone gave me such a hard time. Normally I oder online, but I wasnt sure if they were open and I had to ask him 3 times what time they were open, I just wanted to know for next time. He kept saying \"we arent taking deliver orders, just caryout\"...Well if you close at 12am and its 1159 how am I suposed to get there to caryout anyway? A simple 12am would have sufficed..."}
{"text":"This is the Domino's that destiny (and my zip code) has assigned me in Phoenix for the past 1.5 years, and like any relationship, we've had our ups and downs. Sometimes things work smoothly, as they should, and other times, not so much. I've seen employees come in from a smoke break and start touching food without washing their hands; I've had delivery show up on time but still somehow warm or cold-ish; and I will bet money that if you call them, regardless of what time of day it is, you will get put on hold.   However, my most recent call to them will also be my last. Instead of being greeted by a polite, knowledgeable employee, I was accosted by an angry Latino man whose tone implied I was wasting his time...by calling his job... where he works... to give them money...   Aside from his apparent agitation at the mere thought of customer service, he also didn't know the standard ordering procedure that every other Domino's employee throughout my entire life has parroted precisely. Normally, he'd ask a series of questions that would allow me to quickly and easily place my order, but instead he just said, \"You want a pizza, huh? What kind? Like toppings and stuff?\"  Yes, sir, like toppings and stuff.  So, I've come to the conclusion that this store is, even as I write this, being robbed. That was not an actual Domino's employee I encountered, but rather the robber pretending to be one (Fact: this sort of thing happens all the time, as seen in countless movies). I would call the police, but as I'm leaving Phoenix shortly, forever, this criminal and the subpar Domino's he works out, however temporarily, will be out of my life for good."}
{"text":"I've ordered from this dominos for years now. The past two times I've had to wait 2 hours to receive minimal food. The first time was nearly 3 and a half ours for a chicken sand which, a medium pizza and a salad. Come to find out the only two working is the manager and the delivery driver. I don't blame them for it but this is ridiculous.  The only reason I'm getting dominos delivered is because they're the only place I can get a salad without paying $5.99 for a delivery fee. I'm waiting for the food I ordered at 7:32 and it's already 8:52. No food yet. They need to seriously hire some new people. Running the bare minimum for a delivery pizza place isn't smart especially doing it at night. I've also called multiple times to no one answering the phone or I would get hung up on by the automated service.  UPDATE: I never received the salad I paid for and no one is answering the phone. I've called over 10 times."}
{"text":"This is the best dominos ever! I placed my order online and heard the doorbell ring 30 mins later, if that! Our order was perfect and the chocolate lava cake is to die for!!! Saed was the best delivery driver and my child was more than happy when she heard the doorbell ring with \"her pizza\"!"}
{"text":"This location used to be really good.  About two years ago, it became inconsistent.  And now it's consistently not so good.  You can expect 1 piece of topping on each slice.  This was considered a major offense when I worked for the company 10 years ago.  Now it appears to be the standard.    I used to have a problem with not having cheese on the pizza, but I complained.  Now every pizza I get is really JUST a cheese pizza.  The toppings have become more of a garnish.  It's a shame that you can't get a delicious pizza to the same standards that corporate used to hold.  I'd order twice a month (rather than twice a year) if the product was still as good."}
{"text":"Not sure I am a fan, but it was nice to have food delivered so I did not have to venture out into the 114 degree heat here in Sun City, AZ.    Ours was a small order as eating a low-sodium diet is our challenge right now.  It was hard to find items low in sodium, but it all worked out for this time.  Would love to see \"broiled or broasted chicken\" placed on the menu at some point.    Was impressed by the timely delivery.  Cost was reasonable except the $2.79 for a 2-liter bottle of Sprite -- that was a bit high.  But, again, I didn't have to venture out into the heat, so I won't complain.  After all, I could have elected not to order it.    The thin crust, gluten-free, with veggies was at 380mg sodium for a 1/8 section of a medium sized pizza.  The gluten-free crust is made with Water, Modified Rice Starch, Rice Flour, Brown Rice Flour, Potato Starch, Olive Oil, Potato Flour, Evaporated Cane Sugar, Fresh Yeast, Honey, Avicel, Salt, Calcium Propionate. There was no way to leave out the salt in the crust, so a 1/8 section was all that could be consumed, which is okay because we had prepared a nice home salad and raw pasta cooked in water flavored with extra virgin olive oil.    Made for an okay meal.    I do, however, plan to visit the shop on 99th Avenue in person, before I order again.  I want to speak with the manager and see if there are any suggestions for getting the sodium level even lower on our next home delivery order.  Also like to see what type of environment our food is coming from.    Hope this review is helpful to others that are having special diet concerns, but don't care to venture out into the extreme heat in the Phoenix area."}
{"text":"Just found a chicken bone in my pizza!!!!! Don't order from this Dominos!! I have never been more disgusted in my life. I will never order from here again."}
{"text":"They delivered the pizza on Super Bowl Sunday . . and it was so so . . .  It got to us fairly quick but it was slightly overcooked and more salty than normal. Three stars .... =-/"}
{"text":"If you're hungry and too lazy to get up off of the couch after a long day at work, or because you're just plain lazy, then this Dominos location is the one to order from. The pizza is great including the toppings which are quite fresh. Sometimes that microwave can feel as though it is a million miles away. The employees that deliver the pizza are courteous and quick. No need to dress up and go out. A tank top, boxers and sandals work just fine for those too comfortable to change."}
{"text":"Update - Jan 30, 2017 - This matter has been resolved and the business is making changes to ensure that the chance of happening again are limited. Thank you for attending to this matter.  On Dec 31, 2016, I decided to order Pizza from Dominos. As it was the only option open that offered delivery and I had a coupon, seemed like the wise choice.  Not wanting to charge it and short on cash, I decided to take an uncut sheet of $2 bills I had and cut them up. While it's not the norm and I could have gotten more for them elsewhere, figured wouldn't hurt and the $2 bills would be a nice novelty.  I ordered the items, they were delivered, paid for them with he $2 bills and gave a hearty tip.  I never received any calls or emails on the subject. All my calls are monitored, recorded and logged by a third party and will prove this.  Today, two uniformed officers, doing their job respectfully came to my door. It seems that I was the suspect in a fraudulent case. I asked in regards to what and they informed me that I had paid for pizza with fraudulent two dollar bills.  I then proceeded to show the officers the box they came in from the U.S. Treasury, the original packaging from them as well as other examples of uncut sheets of money as well as proof of purchase from the US Treasury directly, fortunately I saved the original box. They informed me that they had never seen uncut sheets of money.  I asked why the bills were not tested before hand as a test would have shown they were authenticate. I also explained that most banks would freely test the bills without question and confirm their legitimacy. As these bills were from the U.S. Treasury directly, I have little doubt that they are authenticate. In either case, certainly if I had the means to manufacture fraudulent notes, it would be more than $2 bills and the use of pizza at my home address.  In either case, how Dominos handled this was totally out of line. They could have verified the notes with their bank or frankly a $5 bank note pen. They could have also contacted me directly which documents would prove never did. The police did their job and I respect that but Dominos was out of line. Anyone who can't tell the difference between real notes and fake ones deserves no place in a retail environment.  While I respect that this may have been prompted by a low level employee who simply didn't take the time to educate themselves and not Dominos as a whole, I will not be using Dominos anymore. The waste of tax payer dollars, the waste of my time and the waste of officers times best used on real crimes is absurd. I think Dominos owes an apology to law enforcement, an apology to me and needs to educate its people and proper detection of notes, either that or invest in a $5 note checker, something most establishments do."}
{"text":"Took about 20 minutes longer than stated (mind you, this means over an hour so it's not insignificant). Pizza literally tastes like cardboard. There isn't any sauce on it. It's just terrible and maybe the worst tasting pizza I can remember eating."}
{"text":"As far as National pizza chains go Domino's is Head and Shoulders above the competition however there blue cheese dressing is below par I prefer my blue cheese to not taste like mayonnaise with tiny tiny blue cheese crumbles in it.  Please make improvements."}
{"text":"I would've given no stars if I was able to. After a long day of work, picking up kids, walking the dogs and running errands,my husband and I decided to order something quick and easy. Our order to dominos compiled of two sandwiches and a side of wings. Simple, right? Not so much.   Delivery guy shows up with only one sandwich and the wings. We ask him about the other sandwich we ordered and paid for, and he said he would check and just walked off to his car and drove away. So we called the restaurant to make sure we would receive what we paid for. The \"manager\" Ryan put my husband on hold in the middle of him explaining the situation and acted like we were burdening him by even calling. They said they had the sandwich, they just forgot to pack it, and would bring it over. My husband said he wanted a new sandwich made, not one that has been sitting under the heat lamp for an hour.....  35 minutes later, they show up with the sandwich, too bad we lost our appetites. Never again will we order from here. I guess that's why we never order from here to begin with."}
{"text":"Whoever took the order from phone was so very unprofessional! We are 5 minutes away from their store and \"They don't deliver to us\". I was speechless. She said \"We will do it for just once\". You know what? Thank you. I will never do business with you ever, so don't you worry, honey. So unprofessional. 8/5/16 Around 12:10 am, I don't know who worked but they need to train their employees. Also, the driver didn't even had a car topper when he delivered. Pizza came quick, that was very great."}
{"text":"Always got my order right and nice fresh pizza and chicken. Also their. Rey nice thank you"}
{"text":"For a Domino's chain, this is a pretty standard experience. Staff is quick, courteous and the pizza is always to my liking. Their walk in special prices are fantastic for those who may desire Vesuvio's every day but don't have the coin for it at all times. One medium pizza one topping for about $7 cannot be beat!  While it's not up there as the best pizza in the city, I've never had a bad pizza from this place."}
{"text":"So far this is my favorite Dominos and usually do a great job on my pizzas. Only had one mistake so far  in a year and they brought us a new pizza at no charge.(I originally did a take out order) Now that's great service!  I love the dough and sauce, and usually get a hawaiian or green pepper,onion and sausage which have always rocked in the past. Also, despite moving I still take the time to go to this dominos because everyone there gives great service and I like familiarity."}
{"text":"I am in PA a lot!! Almost too much!! i tired to order a pizza at 11:30pm when they closed at 12:00am. No response for 30 minutes on the phone!! They decided that everyone in Malvern didn't want to eat so I'm  outta here! This is the 4th time I've tried to order from them close to their close time and nothing. What kind of a business is that? I (usually) have 40 guests that I am trying to feed and they have disappointed me for the last time! Good luck dominos of Malvern, you have no idea who you just pissed off!"}
{"text":"I've given this location three tries now, which is two more than I should have, but I'm finally giving up and writing a review - wish I could give zero stars.  The first time I ordered from here I was getting it as take-out - just a regular pepperoni pizza and an order of the bread bites. When they said it would be ready in fifteen minutes I didn't question how it would be done so quickly but I definitely should have ! Some parts were underdone and some parts were raw ! The crust wasn't browned at all - it was a uniform beige color and there were no crispy parts at all. I should have opened the box to take a look ! Even a casual glade would have told me to ask them to finish cooking it - this is not how a pizza looks when it's done properly.   The second time was delivery - unlike most reviews here my pizza came very quickly, less than half an hour. Again, I know how it arrived with such speed - they just cut the cooking time ! As I'd specifically asked for it to be well done it was a bit less raw, but still nearly inedible.   Shame on me, but I gave them a third chance, and was once again disappointed. This was take-out, and I used the online ordering feature. It has a place to note any special requests, so I again asked for it to be well done, hoping it would actually be baked to a regular standard of pizza doneness. I assume that was either ignored or it's just standard policy to undercook every pizza they produce, as this one was also undercooked and still raw in some places.   I don't understand how this place is still open ! Sure, it's cheap and it's fast, but there appear to be no kitchen or cooking standards whatsoever. If they told me they weren't allowed to have the oven temperature go above 200 degrees I'd believe them !   I hate writing reviews like this because it can affect peoples' lives and livelihoods, but at some point the management or corporate bigwigs at Domino's need to realize that producing such consistently bad food is going to doom this location. Yes, people want their food quickly, but not at the expense of the quality ! I'm only half-joking when I say that perhaps they should just assemble the pizzas there and give them to people to take home to bake themselves !"}
{"text":"The wings are really bad. They come soggy and the sauce is a gross congealed jelly. I ordered a Brooklyn style pizza, because that's the style I like. I got a regular pizza, which is not the style I like. I also got shortchanged by the lady who delivered it. Don't get your food here."}
{"text":"This place is terrible the GM is rude.  The customer service is crappy.  They can't ever get my pizza order correct them promise they will fix it and don't  The '' professional'' GM told me I don't ever get a free pizza because every time I order something goes wrong but that's my fault right  NOT I will never order from this location ever again  I can tell by the other reviews this place sucks and I'm not that only one who feels this strongly about how much I despise this location"}
{"text":"Shouldn't be shocked by any chain at this point, but don't expect them to help you out. At all. Do it all online. Do not walk in. None of the deals online."}
{"text":"I love this Dominos. I've never had a bad experience. One time they forgot to bring my parm bites, which are like $4 I totally would've let them just bring them the next time I ordered. The manager insisted they bake fresh ones, had someone bring them to me, and even sent desert. I thought that was so kind of her. Besides that one time my food has always come quickly, the order has been perfect, and most importantly hot. The delivery drivers are always friendly and even when I've gone and picked my food up the staff in store was great. I'm definitely a return customer and plan on being one for a while. Try the chicken bacon ranch sandwich, it's amazing. Keep up the good work guys!"}
{"text":"Just ordered a pizza for delivery . My driver was super friendly . However, the pizza was severely undercooked. Even the cheese wasn't fully melted and it was all ooey and doughey and gross :/ accidents happen but the driver was so nice !"}
{"text":"Ordered a pizza from online.  Waited for over an hour for delivery before checking the pizza tracker where it told me that my order had been cancelled. When I called the store they told me that my house was dark and that no one answered when the driver knocked on the door. Funny because I have 4 dogs that love to bark when anyone comes near the door. The store's resolution was to tell me that I could replace my order. Yeah this store is official on my DO NOT USE list."}
{"text":"SSB: secret single behaviour. Any SATC lover (or one who's had to hear about the show) knows it's things we do when we're alone that we wouldn't do in front of our partners. Dominos supplies my SSB trait #1: consuming one large thin crust pizza in a single sitting while watching either TLC, HGTV or Food networks.   I love pizza but I don't like doughy pizza crust (don't tell my Italian godmother, she'll assume it's because I'm anorexic & need to eat more). I've ordered from this location all the time as they're close to me & the large size pizzas are under $12 for pick up. They've got a great array of toppings. The customer service is pretty great, and even when they've messed up my order (happened once or twice), they've either given me my money back or offered me another pizza for free.  One day, I noticed that they carry various pizza crust. After researching* their thin crust pizza, I decided to try it for a Friday night SSB. I ordered a large with extra sauce, pepperoni, green peppers, tomatoes, mushrooms & pineapple. The thin crust is delicious; they even sprinkle basil over the pizza which I love. They also cut the pizza in squares, not triangles. Doesn't matter to me. My belly does not discriminate. It devoured the pizza happily. I didn't even feel guilty afterwards as thin crust is so much healthier which means I probably didn't gain any weight from it.** I now only order thin crust from Domino's; they even know my order just by viewing my cell phone number. This may seem creepy to others but it saves me time to get my pizza quickly and watch my shows! I just hope they'll be able to satisfy my SSB if I get married..maybe deliver to the back door or something.  * Nicole asking \"do I have to pay more for thin crust?\", employee responding \"nah\", Nicole saying \"alright thin crust it is!\" ** A girl can dream, can't she?!"}
{"text":"This location is suck I ordered deluxe pizza and after 45 minutes they delivered plane pizza , called to send me the pizza I ordered and here I am 1 hour passed by and no body is here. You guys suck !"}
{"text":"New location doesn't always mean that you will get the same quality of food when it's a franchise. This location just opened up maybe a month or two ago and it surely doesn't compare to the quality of Dominoes pizza that I normally have. They sent a bunch of coupons to our place to attract new customers so I decided to try it out. The first time I ordered a hawaiian pizza, it was semi burnt and lacked flavour. The second and third time around was just about the same as the first time where I ordered a brooklyn pepperoni pizza and chicken pizza. Both pizzas were cold and tasted almost Iike cardboard! And I hate to compare it to Pizza Pizza but that's what it tasted like. It just didn't taste fresh and that mozzarella cheese didn't come through at all. So I gave this place three shots and regretfully I don't think I will order from this location again at least not for another year. Maybe they will put some more love into making their pizzas by then. 2 Stars given only for the service and design of the store."}
{"text":"Confronted management about employee dealing with money and going straight to making a pizza with the same gloves she had on at the time of the transaction. Was told there oven is hot enough so there is no to worry about sanitization. Will never deal with this store again."}
{"text":"These guys always follow my order to the T and are usually faster then the time given!  Love this place!"}
{"text":"I really like cheesy bread, but I hate this location. I live on Niagara just on the other side of King. A far walk when it gets cold out.  It always takes over an hour.  Half the time the pizza is burned. Too bad. For the love of cheesy bread get your act together."}
{"text":"I am at this location watching the only employee in the restaurant make pizzas and completely ignore the phone ringing forever. Even when she's been right next to it. She was pretty short with me....and she was also rude and short to some customers that just came in. The phone has never stopped ringing for 10 minutes......nobody has picked it up, which explains why I got no answer when I tried to call, so I just walked in. Won't come back. There's a lot of pizza out there"}
{"text":"I don't usually order pizza from \"chain\" places, however i have to say every few months I get a craving for pizza and order for delivery online, I always go to Dominos. Why? Because they have great service and they have very good Artiesian pizzas for a really good price. My favorites are the CHICKEN & BACON CARBONARA and another one is the ITALIAN SAUSAGE & PEPPER TRIO.  What I also like is the Dominos Tracker, which tells you EXACTLY where your pizza is in the pizza making process and WHO is doing it!! Talk about personal service."}
{"text":"I waited 17 minutes for a large cheese pizza and it came out soggy don't waste your money"}
{"text":"Placed an order on line for two pizzas, went to pick them up and they said they did not have my order in the system. Good news is I did not pay online. They offered to make my pizza but they did not offer compensation. I pretty sure someone either picked up my pizza by accident or it was delivered to someone else."}
{"text":"I order from this location frequently enough. Yesterday, I was starving as is usually the precursor to my ordering from Domino's rather than going out. I pretty much order the same pizza, thin crust, chicken, Alfredo sauce and a veggie. It's usually pretty tasty. This time it was really bland. Not sure what I missed. Anyway, I also order the boneless chicken wings out of curiosity. These things are like the gross freezer-burned tasting things that used to come in the tv dinners for little kids back in the day. They are disgusting! Do not order."}
{"text":"Its been a while since we got pizza from Dominos - we were very surprised. Love the tracker and the online ordering was very easy. The food was great. Prices excellent for the quality of the food."}
{"text":"Ordered online delivery.  Was within 10 min of promised time so that was ok. Ordered extra sauce, cause usually it's kinda dry... What I got was pizza SWIMMING in sauce! I pick up a piece, everything slides off there is so much sauce, sh*t!  Also awesome delivery guy, pulls up half on the driveway half on the front yard?. Like, I know your busy... But have some respect for people's property!  Wow, the manager needs to do some training"}
{"text":"I have been ordering from this location for years now and they have never disappointed. Although I couldn't give full 5 stars and that's not the store fault, its Dominos as a company. they would not allow a gift card purchase on the Dominos App. Still pizza is always tasty and delivery is always earlier than expected!"}
{"text":"Great location, I like what they serve.  speedy service."}
{"text":"Came to pick up a pizza on April 13 at 10:55 PM. The whole place smelled like cigarette smoke and I think the employees were smoking inside the store. I still picked up my pizza and it was delicious, but I hope that they washed their hands after they smoked.."}
{"text":"Today will be the last time I ever order from Dominos. While I was sitting there waiting for my pizza one of the \"boys\" working wiped his nose with the back of his hand two times and never went and washed them before starting the next order with NO gloves. Disgusting. Our wings did not taste good at all and our pizza was just ok...last time spending my money there. I'll be ordering from some of the locally owned pizza places from now on."}
{"text":"Wings were fatty and nowhere near anything that I would label as \"good\". I took one bite and left the rest for the hubby. We got a medium pizza with mushrooms on the whole thing and steak on half. The steak was really gross, not gonna lie. I just ate the mushroom pizza part. I will say the delivery was super quick, compared to ALL of the pizza places in the Monroeville area. It only took about 35 minutes from the time we placed the order--and we placed it online. We requested light sauce and we found they did just that once we got the pie. Definitely room for improvement, but not bad prices and didn't have to wait long at all, which was a plus."}
{"text":"Product was good.  Service fast BUT, they said they could not deliver it to my room.  I have ordered several times from this location and it was delivered to my room.  If in fact this is the policy, it should be stated on the website.  I will be contacting Corporate about this!!!!"}
{"text":"I stopped in for walk in service. I ordered 2 pizzas, pasta and a salad. I was greeted promptly by who I believe was the manager. He was very friendly, professional and accommodating. I was told my order would be ready in 15 minutes. I came back in 15 minutes and my order was ready. No over promising and under delivering here. A real breath of fresh air."}
{"text":"They have an in-store buy a pizza get one free promotion that's available only as a call in.   Their pizzas are on the saltier side, but that would pobably be my greatest issue. The toppings are plentiful and the pizza is flavourful (but that comes from having a good deal of salt and seasoning)."}
{"text":"2 weeks ago they forgot part of delivery order. Last night a 25-35 min delivery time, ended up being 65 min.  No more. You've lost this customer."}
{"text":"This place is absolute shit. Came in with a positive mindset and happy to get some pizza and looks like this location hired a bunch of people with bad attitudes. Wouldn't recommend this location to anyone, in fact I'll probably never go to Domino's again. Worst experience ever."}
{"text":"Ordered a 2 3 topping pizzas and some garlic bites online. Went and picked up just fine and cashier was friendly enough but the food was completely incorrect. The topping on both pizzas were mixed, one only had 2 toppings, the slices weren't cut whatsoever, the bread bites were drier than the desert we live in. The only saving grace to my poor, parched mouth was a fanta. Good thing they can't f()ck that up."}
{"text":"Placed a pick up order tonight for two medium pizzas. Pizzas were ready in about 15 minutes while I waited. I was pleasantly surprised by the tasty crust. The cornmeal and the buttery topping added to it is what made the difference. I know Domino's had worked diligently to change its flavor and guest perception of its product. They have certainly come along way in the crust department. Cheese is always a scarcity when you are pushing  low cost as your sales driver.   Another surprise at this location is they have a dining room, small but serviceable if you want to enjoy your meal hot and fresh. This is rare for a primarily pizza delivery concept.   Service here was average as expected.  Overall experience was good and pizza did the trick to feed the bellies of the fam. I might actually come back here again by the end of the year."}
{"text":"For the past 10 years, I have lived literally 200 yards from this location.  Generally I get delivery (because I am lazy), but do on occasion go in for their Mon-Wed special of a large pizza carryout pizza for $7.99 (I am not sure how many toppings, I always get ham and green peppers).  This Domino's has been pretty consistent for me.  Because I am so close, the pizza arrives smoking hot, and generally within the time span that is given on the confirmation email (I usually order during senior citizen dinner hours and never on a busy football Sunday).  Since they have been running the $7.99 medium pan pizza special, I have eaten WAY too many of them.  Every one I have gotten has been well cooked, with adequate toppings and the right amount of sauce.  The new(ish) parmesan bites are very good - light with a sprinkling of parmesan cheese held on by a butter product.  And the lava cakes are the perfect PMS treat.  They come 2 to an order, so I eat one when ordered so it's all chocolate molten-y and eat the other one cold the next day (or the next, but they rarely survive 2 days) and it is like a moist yet crunchy brownie.    Be aware when carrying out, this is located in the Trader Joe's parking lot, which has a. insufficient parking and b. wonky sized parking spaces - SUV's, beware.  I usually drive behind the shopping center to the additional parking.  You still may not find a space, but if you do it is more likely to be wide enough for your vehicle.    The delivery drivers have always been friendly and timely.  Even though I have the choice of Pizza Hut, Papa John's and Hungry Howie's, I typically get Domino's unless I have a specific craving for one of the others."}
{"text":"The pizza was delivered really quickly, but unfortunately it didn't not taste good. The cheesy bread and the cinnamon sticks were hard and pretty burnt and the pizza was disgustingly greasy. We were definitely disappointed!"}
{"text":"Pizza places around the Valley are generally just, meh, and wouldn't prompt me to write a review.  But, I have consistently received amazing service by the crew at this location, both delivery and carry out. They are often quite busy and yet the employees always have a smile on their face and will go out of their way to help and be friendly.  Living and working mere blocks from them I guess I could be called a regular, but this is the kind of place that makes you want to be one.  So, a hat tip to the stellar folks at the Dunlap Domino's.  Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"I  have ordered from this Domino's several times - delivery and been very impressed!  The thin crust pizza is not greasy and has great flavor.  I also am impressed with how quickly it is delivered.  Great job Domino's!"}
{"text":"Every time I call to place an order it takes me about 5 -8 min to get ahold of someone. And when they do answer they are laughing or yelling in the background. Tonight I called to place an order and it sounded like everyone was playing around. Charles could not contain his laugh while I was placing my order. I did ask if they needed me to call and order from a different location due to them fooling around. This location needs someone with customer service skills not teenagers who don't take their job seriously."}
{"text":"I'm really shocked of all of the positive reviews. The two times I made telephone orders both girls had major attitude problems. If you don't like your job, then quit. What a bunch of bit**es. I will never order from them again."}
{"text":"This place is so disorganized I cannot begin to tell you. I ordered online and used the tracker. It told me my pizza was ready for pickup. I went in and saw my name on the screen saying it was out of the oven and in the box. I paid and actually gave a tip because everything seemed to be going so well. Right after I paid I asked for my pizza and they informed me that they had yet to begin my pizza. Wait, what?!?!?! They told me they were backed up. What??!?! So what good is the app then?!? As I watched the crew of 7 stumble around in what seemed to be slow motion, I realized that at no point in the process was anyone putting any information in the computer (pizza creation started, pizza in oven, pizza out and boxed) no wonder the app was wrong! The inner workings of this place were a disaster. No one seemed to really know how to do their respective jobs with any purpose or speed. Don't get me started on the delivery guys who were lucky they knew how to get to this location, let alone any home delivery! As all this was going on, the line inside began to grow with other people whose app told them their pizza was ready too. Customer service was non existent! We looked at each other and just shook our heads as we watched orders get mixed up, boxes with order stickers pile up on various shelves, and the guy running the stove just couldn't tell which pizzas were which and needed help matching them with the correct boxes!!! When my special order pizza came out with so many toppings, the manager (?) realized it was not fully cooked so she put it back in the oven to get it extra crispy. Sigh. In any event, 60 minutes after what should have been 13 I finally got my pizza home. It was hot and tasted alright- nothing special. If I'm going to eat chain pizza, I'll stick with Little Cesar!"}
{"text":"Today at 11:45, I placed an online order for delivery to my job. The forms asked for the usual (name, address, phone number) so I entered my employer information. After an hour, I decided to call because my food had not been delivered yet. I don't know  the woman's name I spoke with but she first told me that the driver called once & nobody answer to which I responded that I work in a pharmacy (the phones don't go unanswered) to which she retorted that now the driver said he called 3 times. She verified the number I called from, which was visible on her caller ID, was the same as the number I provided on the order form when she asked if it was a working number.   This was my first and last time ordering from here. In lieu of what should've been an apology, the workers decided to blame a customer & insinuate I was a liar.   My food arrived after 90 minutes & barely warm."}
{"text":"Alona is an awesome team player. There was a problem with my order and she took initiative immediately and took care of the situation with a smile. If she's not a manager she should become one you should take good care of her so that she will stay on board she is an asset.  Another thing that stood out to me is that she was the only one who picked up the receipts off of the ground while all the other employees just walked past them. To be fair it was very busy eight Friday night however she was also busy and she did not just walk past them she pick them up. That's a sign of great work ethic pride in her work."}
{"text":"Was on the way home and kids wanted to pick pizza for dinner.  Ordered a walk-in special of $11.99 large with 4 toppings. Even though Ot was not dinner or supper time, the place was busy making many pizzas and the place has som many staff. Ordered a Parmesan Bites for $2.99 as well.   The pizza was OK as we had to keep for a few hours before the kids ate and even though warmed up in an oven, it was the same. The pizza also lacked cheese.   The Parmesan bites are bland and we had a couple as soon as we sat in the car. Just bread and Parmesan on it and also lacked cheese. I think they need to be dunked in some marinara or any sauce."}
{"text":"I love this location! This is the dominos closest to home and although we all know this isn't the best pizza in the world it really does hit the spot when you get that pizza craving and you want it fast without breaking the bank! I have had a couple of issues with them such as wrong toppings one time and long delivery times during fight night BUT each time they handled it professionally and fixed the issue right away, will keep giving these guys our business."}
{"text":"I live really close to this domino's. Pretty consistent with quality of the pies. Lots of monthly specials finally. Something I've been begging them for for awhile. Obviously the quality isn't as gourmet as say Blaze downtown but enough to satisfy my take out hunger. I've always like the sausage at domino's though. Nice and salty. mmmm"}
{"text":"Maybe I'm getting old and maybe my taste buds are a changing.....BUT I know what good pizza is and this ain't it!   Got home from Nawlins' Monday evening and I wanted something quick and \"non-cajun\" so I opted for pizza. Built my own as I usually do, and it comes pretty quickly. Good marks there. It's hot too.  So I got the Sweet Italian Sausage, Double Mozzarella and Mushrooms. Pretty basic and it should be good, right? NOT! This pizza was a BLAND as it could be! I mean, HOW is Sweet Italian Sausage BLAND? The cheese had NO saltiness to it at all.....BLAND. The crust had a funky texture to it as well. The entire pizza just was NOT VERY GOOD. AT ALL!  I'm so done with Domino's! This USED to be a damned tasty pizza....with REAL sweet fennel Italian Sausage and quality Mozzarella.   For those who think this is good, try the pizza at Portofinos, or True Crafted Pizza, or Wolfgang Pucks, or Pizza Peel....OK so they don't deliver, but those are GOOD pizza's! Or if you're adventurous, travel to Cornelius and hit Matt's Chicago Dog for the ONLY true Chicago Deep Dish in town....Now THAT has flavor!  If you've got to do a corporate chain take out, I still think Jet's is the best with their butter crust, or Marco's (if there's one by you), or Topper's (if you don't mind spending $26 for a medium with 4 toppings)."}
{"text":"Drove out from our resort and Stopped in to order pizza. Ordered two thin crust, one pepperoni and ham and the other plain cheese.  Didn't check our order and came back. We get to our room and the cheese pizza had NO CHEESE. We called and spoke to a supervisor and she offered to give us credit for another meal. We were starving and had bread and marinara sauce instead of cheese pizza. She offered to correct the order. We asked if they could deliver it since they messed up the order. ....NOPE! We drove all the way back to pick it up.  Whoever owns this Dominos....... you need to check your employees."}
{"text":"I've been a customer for many years and today I have been treated poorly. They were basically calling me a liar about my card info when I am staring at my card! They have lost a customer and I will be damn to tell everyone I know not to go there!"}
{"text":"Couldn't deliver unless 2.5 hours and wouldn't allow pick up- stupid! Girl on phone is also rude. #quitbitch"}
{"text":"It's hit or miss with this location. I pay the most $$ for gluten free pizzas. I wish there was more consistency between the pizzas from day to day. Today, I spent $40 and some change on 2 small gluten free pizzas (not including tip), and I received 2 burnt, extra crispy, difficult to eat, very dry pizzas. The pizzas seemed like they had light cheese. I ordered regular cheese. The edges were burnt. I requested normal bake. On January 10, 2018, whoever was baking the pizzas that evening made the best ever gluten free pizza I have ever had at dominoes. Cheese was perfect. Crust was crispy light brown  but edible and not hard (like today). That was a 5-star worthy pizza. It was made excellently. I wish today's cook would take some lessons from the jan. 10th's pizzas maker. Highly disappointed and such a waste of money."}
{"text":"The worst delivery service I have ever had I ordered the pizza at like 10:20PM and it's almost been 2 hours latter and still no pizza. Worst delivery system ever."}
{"text":"Okay, so this Domino's location has got it goin' on. They deliver crazy fast and never mess up orders, which is all I ask of a fast-food pizza place! The employees are always polite & friendly, and the food is always hot. Props to whoever manages this place!"}
{"text":"If they could only figure out how to take phone orders without putting people on hold for 6, 7, or 8 minutes or more, they'd be doing well. This Domino's is very close to my house and when I get a craving for their new, rather yummy, thin crust pizza, it's just easier for me to drive up there and order.  But then I'm relegated to sitting in the very drab waiting room.  I wouldn't necessarily recommend this location too much after sunset. They've had some issues in the parking lot (shootings and the like)."}
{"text":"Terrible. Pizza undercooked, inedible and looked terrible, as were the bread bites. Delivery showed up over 30 minutes after the online tracker said he left (and 15 minutes after it said Mmmm your pizza is there and we hope you're enjoying it). I'm usually very understanding but I just couldn't. At least when I called they connected me to the manager who said he would send someone to pick up the food and would give me a refund. My next call was to Jake & Sons Pizza, which I should have called in the first place."}
{"text":"The worst service. My fiancé called to order a large meatlover pizza. An hour later, we realize its not here so he calls. The man on the phone said that there is no order under our phone number and address. Its 12:30am and were pissed. How do you not put the order in when we call and speak with you. We have this in my fiances phone history and you shiukd have your calls recorded so LOOK FOR IT. Honestly, the man on the phone eas way too rude and has absolutely no customer service experience at all. Unacceptable!!"}
{"text":"Alright I've never been to this place but I've ordered delivery from this location twice in the past month.    A) Delivery is faster than Pizza Hut and Pizzaville. They usually deliver within 30 to 35 minutes as opposed to 45 minutes.  B) The sauce and crust has improved drastically from 10 years ago and their Brooklyn pepperoni (larger than normal) is mildly spiced.  C) The cheesy bread is SOOO good.  Better than Little Caesars.  I am so surprised by Domino's and now rates in my top 3 of pizza chains."}
{"text":"Don't understand what all the bad reviews are about, this is one of the best Domino's I've ever been to. The food was the same if not better than the other locations, the staff is extremely friendly, and for the first time ever - the lobby actually has tables and chairs to eat right at the store. Also over heard a manager training a new employee while I was waiting and he was being extremely patient with her which is great because it was dinner rush. Will go to this location again and again."}
{"text":"the worst pizza we have ever eaten.every frozen pizza better than this.crust is terrible and also the sauce,italian sausage if ya want to call it that! will never order a pizza from here ever again!!!!!"}
{"text":"Wow, there are a bunch of idiot's working   at this place. The person ( some girl ) answering the phone and taking the orders is horrible at doing her job. She put me on hold numerous times, I had to repeat myself on everything I ordered....don't know how this girl has a job. When the pizza arrived they forgot my dipping sauces and the driver seamed like he was annoyed that he has to deliver pizza. This place is a joke, don't order from this location... The staff is horrible, the wings were burnt, the pizza was barely warm. Never again!"}
{"text":"Worse experience ever. Doesn't even deserve one star.  For some reason I was craving pizza, and since dominos is closest I decided to just go there and pick up a pizza.  All I ordered was two small one topping pizzas and pizza bites. Well I was there for over 40 minutes waiting. I saw that the guy had forgot to put in the order which contributed to the long wait, but he didn't care.  When I finally got my order, the pizza was cold, and I was pissed off from waiting for so long. When I brought this to his attention he just said \"sorry\" and walked away.  Maybe if the pizza was decent, I would have been semi-appeased about the situation. But it wasn't, and I wasn't.  In the future, get your pizza from somewhere else, because this place was awful."}
{"text":"I see a few negative reviews on here about this location, but I disagree.  I order delivery from this location about once a week for the past 4 months.  I choose dominoes because their menu fits my budget.  They have never yet got my order wrong!  That's pretty impressive for any pizza place if you ask me.  The delivery guys are always very friendly and professional as well.  They all have also been very gracious when I leave a tip.  Consistently great service!"}
{"text":"The pizza was SO YUMMY! We had a large pepperoni pan pizza. My husband and I REALLY enjoyed! Flavor was wonderful, until the tummy ache happened. :( won't call it food poisoning, but it was 100% uncomfortable, and had us up all night. Unfortunately we knew it wasn't any other food we'd eaten because this was all we had eaten all day. The customer service was wonderful, they were so nice and friendly! So they're getting a 3/5"}
{"text":"This place is a joke. Exactly what everyone says that's negative in their reviews is true. I'm sitting here now phones are ringing no one is answering. They don't even greet you. I don't know how it's still in business. I didn't see the reviews before waking or i would have not walked in here. Dominos is a joke for letting them have this many bad reviews and they still continue to operate horribly ?"}
{"text":"Eat at YOUR OWN RISK.  Last night my fiance and I ordered two pizza's for delivery through the Domino's app at roughly 7:35pm. While keeping tabs on the app, I found that the pizza remained at the \"quality check\" portion for more than a half hour. I decided to wait a few minutes, and roughly 10 minutes later the pizza's arrived an hour after being ordered. The delivery driver was deadpan and short, and the pizza was lukewarm at best. Normally delivery ordered from this location through the app comes in half the time, but I was willing to overlook that.  What I was not willing to overlook was the food poisoning that I had from the pizza. I woke up at 4 AM to stomach cramps, nausea, and even worse symptoms that I won't go into gory detail on here. I was miserable for HOURS. I will NEVER eat here again. I suggest you don't either, unless you have a fetish for gastrointestinal issues and vomit."}
{"text":"After ordering on line the pizza sat for almost an hour before being delivered. I called while waiting with a concern that it would be cold by the time it was delivered, and was told it would still be hot. When it finally arrived it was not at all warm, not worth the wait or the price. Looking for a new pizza place!"}
{"text":"It's Domino's.  Nice that they deliver, especially into Sun City.  Friendly people on the phone and delivering.  A very efficient and clean operation.  What's more to say?  Nothing bad as they are what they advertise:  Good pizza at reasonable prices...delivered."}
{"text":"Ads on tv brag about all the cheese and quality toppings.  What a joke.  They were fast and the counter lady very pleasant.  I would actually pay more for better ingredients.  But it will but not here.  They were not busy, wonder why."}
{"text":"My family and I love Dominos. However this location has the worst customer service and offers the worst product! If you do delivery expect to wait hour half plus no matter what night you order also your meal will be cold. They will prepare your food and sit on tray for hour till they can deliver! When call into the store they offer no fixes just express they are short staff. Awful experience from beginning to end!"}
{"text":"My experience is basically the same as the previous review.  I worked for Domino's on and off for almost the entire 90s and a lot of things have changed.  While I prefer a local pizza, for the times when I ordered from a chain recently it would be Papa John's since they are on the way home.  I have ordered from this Domino's for delivery and carryout recently and the pizza definitely tastes better than PJ's.  The new pan pizza is very good but was a little undercooked when we ordered it.  The regular pizzas were fine.  The place appears very clean which is always nice.  If this place was on my way home (as they once were before moving to this location), I would probably order more often.  The online pizza experience is pretty neat too."}
{"text":"Friendly, competent staff, clean restaurant and food was done per order. I'll visit again!  Not high end pizza, but I'm rating it against similar places.   The only reason for knocking off a star is more my selection. The  crunchy crust was more thin and crunchy than I liked. Not much left, though. ;)  It should be great in Brooklyn style.   Keep it up guys!"}
{"text":"Had an incredible $1.99 large one topping pizza deal but it took over two hours to get here and was cold!"}
{"text":"This Dominos is one of the best that I have ever ordered from.  The delivery people are always nice, courteous, and prompt.  They have even had me check my food before they left to ensure that it was to my expectations.  The pizza is always hot and fresh, regardless of the time of day.  I love this Dominos!"}
{"text":"One of the worst experiences I've ever encountered of manager employee relations. The restaurant was very busy due to Cleveland Browns game and Mayweather fight.  It was clear that manager Becky could not handle the pressure. She talked to her staff terrible and treated them less than human. I waited over an hour for four pizzas. Once my order was complete it was missing one pizza. Becky then told me she did not know where my other pizza was and attempted to bribe me with 2  random pizzas of which i did not order.   After going back and forth and not accepting the bribe she finally made my missing pizza with ATTITUDE. Stay away from this place especially if Becky is working.  My advise is she needs to go through a training course. Employees look at manager to lead and she failed at that."}
{"text":"Good food and fast deliveries but not to my door.  The drivers get to the parking lot and make me walk out, they refuse to leave there cars and walk to the apartment.  If I meet them in the lot and say the money's in my home they get an attitude.  It will be a while before I order again.  Pizza was good guess it's carry out for now."}
{"text":"What happened? About a two years ago the pies were great. Now, the dough is old, the toppings skimpy. The drivers always forget the red pepper sprinkles. This review is not based on one order, this is based on the last 5 or so pies bought. This store has been consistently  disappointing. I've called a talked with the store manager a few times. He was very nice and appolgized - but apparently he is running his store cheap and the quality of his product is suffering.  I would recommend that you skip this place and try one of the frozen pizzas in the grocery store."}
{"text":"The sense of entitlement of a certain delivery driver is ridiculous regarding tips. You only delivered a pizza, from about 3 miles away; not exactly complex or deserving of anything more than a thank you. I won't be ordering again. I tipped anyway but the reaction and blatantly obvious expectation were a total turnoff."}
{"text":"Ordered a pizza and 8 bone in wings. The pizza was fine it's the wings that were horrible.  Greasy meat Jello on a stick is what the consistency was like. I bit into one just to see if it may taste better than they felt. Nope they taste just as bad and just plain nasty."}
{"text":"Just tried delivery from Domino's on Mark Street in Henderson, yummy and they were fast. Also, this  is the first time I tried the new improve recipe love it"}
{"text":"Mmm love Domino's. I order practically the same thing each time. It's usually delivery but I've gone in to pick up my order too. These employees are great. The tracker will let you know the names of who's making your pizza, who has checked on it and who's going to deliver. We try to tip good. I wish they had more of a selection on bread sticks though. Just cheesy bread sticks without the jalapenos. The parmesan bread bites are pretty good. There should be way more reviews for these guys. They haven't disappointed me yet. Kudos to this Domino's."}
{"text":"Very excellent, the experience was positive, the food was good. This is a great stop if you are in a rush and hungry. The only downside is the they lack a unique taste. The positive is that they are the same everywhere you go!"}
{"text":"I got the best pizza I've had from dominos today! $9.99 large pizza with unlimited toppings~ I ordered Brooklyn style, super crunchy, cheese smells sooo good yum!  But they forgot my soda, I had to go back ask for it :("}
{"text":"I love them order off of just eat so it's nice and simple delivery is always fast and the food is always hot ... Good job guys!!!!"}
{"text":"I give this 3 stars because I have always had issues with this store. I think dominos is now too expensive and it is not as good as it used to be. The delivery takes longer then other restaurants in this area and the quality of the food is not that great. Phone manners can be worked on and only order using the website (which is pretty cool). Bring back the Dominos Pizza that we had on the 80's."}
{"text":"Worst customer service ever. The man taking my order was rude and sneered at me as I asked him what the specials were. I will take my business elsewhere."}
{"text":"The last 3 times, I've come here out of convenience, and the service was horrible - very horrible. Still, the food was actually good. So, I refrained from doing a bad review because I know how customer service jobs can be. Tonight, I was quite pleased to see that they had hired more people to handle the counters, and the service was exponentially better all around. Everyone, even the ones not having to deal with customers, seemed to be pleasant with each other... and it's 6:00pm on a Monday night... aka Monday Night Football! They are very busy, but pleasant!"}
{"text":"I must say.... they deserve 5 stars for the improvement over their old pizza of years past. The pan pizza was restaurant quality, cheap, and delivered to my door. What more can I ask for?"}
{"text":"Won't order from these morons ever...The \"kid\" picked up the phone and said \"yeah\", after I was on hold for 5min..."}
{"text":"So I've tried to get a cheesy pizza from here. Not possible. I've done additional cheese toppings plus extra cheese and I'm charged for it but no go. I called tonight to finally get an explanation on this and I'm told that on the pan pizza it's not possible!! They put less cheese on the pan crust and by asking for extra it's still not the extra that you would get on a regular crust pizza! Wtf!! Where does it say this!!?? Will no longer order from them. Not really because of the lack of extra cheese but now because of deceit."}
{"text":"Pizza was good. However thought it quite rude of delivery driver to park in the driveway of my home. My mother gets home around this time and I know she wouldn't have appreciated to have to wait for him to back out of our driveway. Also gave a decent tip and barely got a thank you from Alexander the driver."}
{"text":"Went at 11 and they couldn't break our $100. They told us go to 711, they couldn't either so we went to Walmart, 30 Mom later we paid and got our pizza, wings and sub, cold. Good thing dominoes is tasty."}
{"text":"Do not order if it's after 12am. They pretty much gave us whatever left orders they had. Pizza was terrible tasted dry and the pasta was horrific. Total waste of our money and was looking forward to some good pizza, what a total disappointment. Do not order from this dominoes."}
{"text":"17 June 2017: I am giving 3 stars now instead of my original rating of 1 star because I got a call from Andrew (the general manager) and he refunded our full amount and gave us a pizza. He even suggested a thin crust so we wouldn't have any issues. I really appreciate Andrew remedying this bad experience.    16 June 2017: Tonight I ordered the stuffed cheese bread, stuffed spinach feta cheese bread, Italian sausage marinara bread bowl, and a provolone steak sandwich. Everything except the steak sandwich had raw dough. I called and spoke to Jennifer (an assistant manager). She said she'd get our order remade and it would be here in 30-40 minutes. Over an hour later our remade food arrived and the driver was very awkward because I didn't give him payment and I had to explain that our previous order was messed up. We opened up all of the remade food and AGAIN all of the dough was raw.  I called again to let them know (especially since I'm ServSafe certified) and the guy that answers laughs and said hold on. He then yells to James (an assistant manager) and tells James while laughing that someone is calling about raw dough.  After speaking to James he says he can't give me a refund, but if I call tomorrow that the General Manager could give me a refund."}
{"text":"They stacked thick mushrooms on the sliced  italian sausage. Every bite was delicious. Ordering through coupons online makes it easy to stretch a reasonably priced meal when the funds are low."}
{"text":"Impeccable service. Pizzas are made the dominoes way, which when it's on point is pretty good. Had an order messed up once and within 24 hours was contacted by both corporate and the store owner to make it right."}
{"text":"Whoever makes the pizzas must not like mushrooms because every time i ask for extra mushroom, which i only do because theres barely any there in the first place, they still dont apply extra mushrooms. Other than that this place is awesome and i always order when i need a pizza fix."}
{"text":"About six months ago I ordered from this place while we were at a local bar. The manager didn't take my girlfriends credit card info correctly over the phone. Instead of calling us back to straighten it out, they delivered the pizz anyways and the driver said we could only pay with cash. This happened after we had problems with our order from the same place a week prior. My girlfriend called and wanted to complaine and the manager, who's real name is Abraham, gave her a fake name over the phone. I told the driver to take the pizza back and that we'd never do business with them again. He said some choice words and I fired right back. Then in front of a bar full of people he said, \"I'll fuck your pretty mouth\"! I was utterly shocked. As much as I wanted to take him behind the bar and solve the dispute, I kept my cool. I reported this to Domino's corporate office and they did absolutly nothing! Never called me back and didn't fire the driver. I was shocked at the lack of concearn over the situation. There were over five people in the establishment I was at that all said they would vouche for what they saw and Domino's basicly snubbed me. I will never order from there again and this problem has stopped my friends, family and work from ordering pizza from there."}
{"text":"Well, where do I start? Judging from all the bad reviews this store already has I doubt this review will make any difference, but I'm going to write what I have to say anyways.  We've always loved Dominos pizza. Their crust is the best and well, lets be honest, Pizza Hut isn't all that great anymore. Little Caesars is a glorified Chuck-e-Cheese pizza. Sure, there are other great pizza places, but why can't they all be good? Ok so back to Dominos... (This store anyways).   My wife and I purchased a house in North Las Vegas a few years ago and prior to moving up here from the southwest corner of Las Vegas, we always ordered Dominos pizza when we were craving it. Never really had any problems to speak of, sure, I'm sure there had been a botched order or two in the past but nothing majorly noteworthy. Since we moved up to NLV the nearest Dominos is store #7469.... yes, that is all it is getting from me. It's just a store number at this point. Since my wife and I both work 40 hours plus a week we usually call in a delivery order. We would order at least one specialty pizza and some sides or everyone might be craving the pasta bowls. My favorite is the chicken habanero sandwich.  I can't recall the last time we EVER received a delivery order that was entirely correct. Pasta bowls were either missing lids, not in a bread bowl or not in a tin depending on how it was ordered. They might even be the entirely wrong pasta bowl and someone would get screwed out of their dinner and either go without or eat something they didn't order. The pizzas have arrived cold on occasion or be the wrong pizza or missing items that were ordered. I know a pizza is a super simple meal but it can be screwed up oh so many ways.  After oh, I don't know, the 15th time we've ordered delivery.... (Because we kept saying this is the last time we will order here) but somehow the lure of Dominos got the best of us and we would say... ok lets give them one more chance. So after about the 15th time we ordered, the pizza was correct, the pasta bowls were correct.... holy crap! Did we finally get an order correct... 100%? Last item up for bid was my chicken habanero sandwich. I opened it up, took a bite and immediately put it down. They forgot to put the habanero sauce on it. It was the most bland and dry sandwich I ever had in my life. I can tell you first hand... that habanero sauce is what makes that sandwich tasty.  Ok, so it was messed up once again. This time it was only me that suffered but I was so mad that I got the short end of the stick this time I called the driver (I had her number because she called me to let me know she was running 30 minutes late) OMG I just recalled this order took over an hour to get. Ok so two strikes for store #7469 just on this visit alone. She told me that she would give me a store credit and I got off the phone. I thought about it for a minute and realized she meant a store credit that I could cash in next time I order from there. Hold up!! Wait a minute... after this fiasco? I had no intentions of ordering from here ever again (we've all heard that one before, right?) but this time I meant it. I called the driver back to clarify that this \"credit\" was of no use to me, as I had no intentions of ordering from there again. She said there was nothing else she could do for me so I told her to just forget the credit and that we would never be ordering from them again.  Fast forward 8 or 9 months and guess what....? I was in Henderson on my way back home from a friend's house. I decided to install the dominos pizza app once again and put in an order for carry out. Carry out... haa, this time I figured I would be there picking up my order and I could make sure everything was correct before I left the store. So I place my mobile order about 25 minutes before I arrive at the store to make sure when I get there I can just tell them who I am, pay for the food and be on my way. I arrive at the store; I tell them I placed a carry out order and my name. They took my payment and told me my order wasn't quite ready and that it will just be a minute. At first I was surprised at this because I had already given them a solid 25 minutes to make the food. So I sit down and wait... 5 minutes later they tell me they forgot to make my chicken habanero sandwich. WHAT??? Seriously? The sandwich STILL has to go through the oven conveyor belt and will take about as long as a pizza. Ok so now I'm realizing they already got me here. What are my choices? Sit and wait for my delicious chicken habanero sandwich or just get a refund on it and take the pizza only. I scoffed and decided to wait. In the meantime they told me they would make me an order of garlic knots for free and give me a free 2-liter of soda. I said sure, whatever you could do for me. End result, they made the wrong sandwich and sent me home without it."}
{"text":"We bought a house in North Las Vegas about a year ago. We have ordered from this Dominos more times than we should have. Incorrect orders EVERY time!! I've had Dominos Pizza many times before here and have never had this much trouble with any one store.   I had a free pizza and I decided to use it tonight. I thought maybe, just maybe they will get it right this time. I also ordered a couple sandwiches, parmesan twists and an additional pizza for the kids. Its out for delivery....   20 minutes later.... The delivery driver texts me to let us know they are running behind and that they are on their way now. 40 minutes total it took for them to deliver. Ok, no big deal.  Driver arrives, very polite and apologetic about running late. No problem.  I ask my wife to take the food upstairs and check to make sure its correct. She does a once over and says everything is good. Great!  Finally we got an order correct.   NOT, I came up to find that the pizza was not hot anymore, and my chicken habanero sandwich is missing the HABANERO sauce! WTF?? Seriously? That is a MAJOR ingredient for this sandwich!! Absolutely awful without it!! The one item I order for myself and its F#$%ing wrong??  Ok, so I text the driver back and she said they would credit me $15. I figured ok! At least I wont have to pay for a sandwich that Im not going to eat anyways and a little extra for the trouble. A couple minutes later I get a call from the driver and she says she's going to give me a $20 credit but it is only in the form of store credit. Um, ok, well, I explain to her that I have been down that road many times before.... and several times with THIS store due to them ALWAYS messing my order up. I have yet to be successful in claiming one of those so called credits! When I call in to redeem they mysteriously cannot find any information indicating I have a credit. Regardless, I've decided to NEVER order from there again so a \"store credit\" would be worthless to me. I told her to just forget the credit and that I will not be ordering from there ever again. She responded, \"ok\".   To anyone from this Dominos store, if you get the nerve to call me and try to make it \"right\".... just save it! I want nothing to do with your store ever again and I will definitely tell you where you can stuff your pizza. Do yourself a favor, get your crap together. Quit hiring lazy people to work for you or have some better training in place. That seems to be the problem with businesses that hire young kids too. I get it, these kids need some work experience and fast food seems to be the door from which to enter the workforce. I see tons of lazy kids AND adults these days. Im constantly hearing from other people I know about how they work with these lazy people that do not want to do anything. WAKE UP PEOPLE! This is going to be the demise of our economy! Lazy millennial and some of my generation. I get up at 3:45am and go to work every week day. Im NEVER late and I always do my job to the best of my ability. Its really not that hard to do!!"}
{"text":"I hadn't ordered Domino's in quite a while and I saw an ad on TV about how they improved the pizza.  They had a mix and match $5.99 and thought I'd give it a try.   I ordered 8 hot and spicy wings, an pasta carbonara, and a medium pizza.  The pasta carbonara was better than the pasta at Pizza Hut.  I ordered it w/ extra sauce and there was no extra sauce, there was actually no sauce because it had been baked/broiled in an oven and the liquid either baked off or was absorbed by the pasta, it had a gluey consistency.  I would rate it one and a half stars and it was the \"best\" dish.  The wings were not spicy and they were undercooked and rubbery.  They were also the smallest wings I've ever seen (maybe hummingbird wings?).  I ate part of two of them and threw the rest away.  The pizza was cold and undercooked.  Heating it up made it taste worse.  I ate part of a slice and threw the rest away.  In the \"special delivery instructions\" I asked the driver to buzz my intercom and I'd meet him at the door.  Instead my phone rang and went I got to the front door, he was parked across the street.  He just sat there in the driver's seat and after a few minutes it was apparent he wasn't going to cross the street and meet me at the building, so I had to go to him.  Minor and nit picky, I know, but I was tired and hungry and I paid for delivery, but I guess not to my door.  All the major chain pizza is not great, but this is the worst I've had."}
{"text":"Asked for special with meet. Said 12.99 then when I picked up they had a special for 7.99I asked about it and was told \"ya I guess we could of offered you that\" smart ass.  No tip. As I'm leaving some smart ass loud mouth women yells \"you have a nice day anyway\""}
{"text":"While waiting out front of the restaurant I place a call to make an order. It Took longer then they said. They call it thin crust not soggy crust."}
{"text":"I don't normally use yelp as a venting platform for bad experiences however tonight I find the need. I placed an order online over 90min ago. Look I get it the weather isn't the greatest but the snow has stopped. It's just cold. I called the store and the girl I spoke to said it would be another hour!! Ok well can I talk to a manager. Nope. They are out delivering pizzas. So I canceled my order and off my lovely husband goes to bring home dinner. I wouldn't have had a problem with the 3 hour wait time if I was informed of it at the time I placed my order. Alas dominos I'm sorry to say I must break up with you on this Valentines Day. I'm sure your soul mate is out there somewhere it's just not me."}
{"text":"No stars  I hope i can give a 0 star  ... They dnt like to work  They keep telling you it will take 30 min to get a large pizza  They dnt answer phones all the time ringing  They work without cloves"}
{"text":"It isn't like we all don't know how a Domino's Pizza tastes.  Meh...  But when you are even too lazy to get up from the computer to order a pizza (assuming the phone is out of reach), the online deliver works excellent.  I'm a bad person for accepting convenience over taste, but sometimes one must only think of themselves."}
{"text":"It's pizza, so how can you possibly mess that up for a teenager? My teenager actually lost her appetite after attempting to eat a slice of pizza.   We ordered a Brooklyn Style crust. Pizza crust from NY isn't soggy. Yes, the crust was actually soggy. Next, the sauce! The flavor of the sauce was actually pretty zippy & yummy. However, there was so much sauce!!! We actually joked about how many pasta dishes we could make with the extra sauce & still have enough for the pizza. The toppings were mediocre to say the least.   Overall, idk if it was the staff that messed it up or if this is how dominos does business now."}
{"text":"Went to get a pizza tonight at 2:40am.  Parked for five minutes at the bank.  Got towed.  Be warned they patrol all of the nearby parking spots.  In the time it takes to run in and get your pizza your car will be towed.  $250 to get your car back."}
{"text":"Great service! These guys are quick about getting pizzas made no matter the day or time.   This place is eon's better than Pizza Hut."}
{"text":"The wings here are bad, i asked for hot wings not chicken in a box and they took a long time just to deliver 16 wings i wait for 2hrs and 27 min and the funny part is that i gave then instructions very specific to where i lived and the driver still went to the wrong spot."}
{"text":"Who ever tristin is... He deserves the 5 stars! Great customer service ill keep gettin pizza because of him!"}
{"text":"What more can I say, I love pizza! When I'm feeling too lazy to cook dinner, this is my go-to for pan pizza. Inexpensive and ready in about 10minutes. Delivery is a little expensive since pizza places have been tacking on extra charges for delivery. I usually just go and pick up a pizza. Try their pan pizza, it's delicious and not as greasy as some of the other chains. The staff (except the girl who sometimes works here) are friendly and my order is usually ready in 10-12 minutes. They have a neat system which let's you see the status of your order on a TV screen from start to finish.  Would recommend if you're looking for your pizza fix and they also have inexpensive walk-in specials. Large for under $10!"}
{"text":"I LOVE the Pan Pizza and how cheap it is only $7.99 plus tax not bad considering I can have two meals out of this. :) When I picked it up the pizza was HOT and was done in less than 15 mins so I have to give this place a 4 star for their service."}
{"text":"January 21 7:10 PM I ordered a pizza for carry out from dominoes at 4150 Boulder Highway, Las Vegas. I arrived at 7:20 PM and the display showed that my order was ready. As I was walking up to the counter to pay they were handing a pizza to someone who had been in the store waiting. He left, I paid for my order and then they could not find my pizza. Just one or two minutes later the previous customer returned with a pizza, the box open, flaps up, the pizza sticking out. That pizza had only had pepperoni and sausage which was what I had ordered. One slice had been torn out and thrown back in the box. They also couldn't find his pizza but they believe they sent it on a delivery. They slid that pizza into the box with my order sticker on it and they handed it to me. My food order was given to another customer who left the building with it, who opened box AND HANDLED THE FOOD, and then returned it to the store. The female delivery driver who took my payment handed that to me and said that my pizza was ready. Even if it didn't appear that the customer handled the food, you already know you cannot present food received by another customer to another customer as their meal. You know that. You are breaking all ethics of food handling practices and you are committing health code violations of any county in the United States . Even so, your store manager and your store employees believed there was nothing wrong with that. If that's the way the store does business they should be shut down immediately."}
{"text":"This is the best location I've ever been to hands down. Super quick and friendly service. Love the hand man pan pizzas. App makes ordering a breeze. Keep up the great work!"}
{"text":"This was my main pizza place to order pizza but from the rudeness of the driver because he couldn't read the GPS right and took it out on me to the manager that was obviously going to sweep my complaint under the rug, this is by far the worse experience I've ever had and will never order from this store again. If you ever get Robert as a driver you might as well cancel your order before he blows a fuse on you too!"}
{"text":"There was PLASTIC & GLASS pieces in their pizza and ordered n paid for 3 toppings and was only given 2 toppings... Plzz don't get food here its fatal !!"}
{"text":"I ordered online with the app on my phone and it was very convenient way of ordering pizza.  The delivery driver was so quick and my order was accurate.  From the time I placed my order, to the time it took to prepare my food, and to the time it was delivered, it took a little under 20 minutes.  I will order from this place again using the app I have grown to love, but the only complaint is that they should give larger portions of food for the price they are charging."}
{"text":"This location is one of the only chain restaurant locations, along this strip of the junction. The pie's are good. The service ok They lose 1 star for not having seating, for patrons(unlike most other locations)"}
{"text":"I love the gluten free pizza and the hot wings they are very delicious and what makes this specific place wonderful is their customer service they are all very nice they treat you with respect specially one of the workers name Richard he is very polite and every time I go to pick up my food he gives me excellent customer service if you live in the area I highly recomed them to any one"}
{"text":"If I could give a 0 I would. Ordered a pizza online with an estimated delivery time of 84 minutes max. About a half hour after the order was placed, we were notified by the delivery tracker that the pizza was ready. 84 minutes passes and I call. After 10 minutes of waiting for a person to answer the phone, they then tell me their delivery time is 3-4 hours. ARE YOU KIDDING ME. No apologies or anything. I will never order from here again."}
{"text":"Ordered over phone. Courteous service. Food came in less than 20minutes. The pizza was warm and delicious."}
{"text":"Can't believe it. What a waste of my money. We ordered a large pizza, bread sticks, cinnamon sticks, chicken pasta and soda. When the food was delivered I asked for peppers and cheese. I was told by they charge 1.25 per pack. Of and I don't have any on hand. The food was bad. The pizza was ok. However the rest lacked flavor.  I won't be ordering from them again."}
{"text":"This Domino's used to be VERY VERY BAD but the pizzas and the service is alot better. I no longer try to have them deliver because the drivers from the past were always 30 mins to a hour late and I only live 8 minutes from there. Now I place my order online or on my app and the pizza is always good and ready within 10 minutes so its all good."}
{"text":"Even though we've lived in the Boro for a while, we haven't gone to Dominos until a week ago. We ordered pizza, sandwiches and their \"brownie cookie.\"  I was greeted as soon as I walked in the door. My order was hot and ready.  The pizza was excellent and so were the sandwiches. I will order the cookie again. The restaurant was brightly lit and clean. I thought the prices were very good and even got a coupon discount."}
{"text":"Always a fresh hot ZA! Accurate orders and super fast service! Always craving pizza from DOM! Keep it up! $7.99 3 topping large Monday through Thursday!!!"}
{"text":"The store is new to Harrisburg and a welcome addition.  We decided to give them a try and glad we did.  Domino's pizza is so much better than it used to be.  We had a few mistakes when they first opened but they made them right.  Their specials and quick services can't be beat."}
{"text":"I placed an order 2 days in advance for my sons birthday lunch at school. When we went to pick it up today they told me they got a bigger order so mine wouldn't be ready until noon. After my sons birthday lunch. Unacceptable. Do not count on this Dominos location."}
{"text":"Tried to order a pizza on a Sunday night at 10:pm and they told me that delivery would be an hour and a half. I said forget it, I can make it quicker than that. I just didnt want too."}
{"text":"We've waited well over an hour 1/2 for two medium pizzas that claimed to be in transit over an hour ago. Hopefully my food isn't cold when it gets here... if it ever does. Like what in the f. Should've listened to past yelpers, Jesus Christ"}
{"text":"Domino's Pizza is A-OK !  I go to this Domino's about once or twice a year especially since they came out with their pan pizza's which are so yummy and at a decent price.  Medium pan pizza and two toppings only $7.99.  Domino's is not the best pizza as we have our favorite pizza spot but from time to time we love to have a slice of Domino's pizza and the stuffed cheese bread.  Great prices.  Great location.  Domino's is A-OK."}
{"text":"Damn. I like Dominos, but this location is starting to suck. I place my order on line. Tonight it's very late being delivered. Then they deliver the wrong sandwich. I call, and can barely here the person I was talking to. He kept having me repeat myself, and was rude. I won't have them ever deliver anymore. It takes too long.  They need to hire more drivers or have a change in management.  It's not rocket science, it's delivery.  They've cheated me out of extra mushrooms twice before. Watch for those extra toppings you don't get. Better yet, order elsewhere, as I plan on doing!!!  Well, the second sandwich Never showed up!!  Really, WTF Dominos... is this how you treat your customers??  I called and spoke with the manager.  Third sandwich on the way with a soda ( a soda for my inconvenience, not Their inability to do Their job!! )   It came. It was hot. It looked like it was just thrown together without care. I added my own cheese since they didn't put any on. Yeah, I'd stay clear of them."}
{"text":"Always extremely fast delivery and great food...best overall pizza that delivers in this area"}
{"text":"Had the worst experience tonight dealing with the manager at this particular Dominos she's a BITCH her name is Sarah . She should not be a manager she has poor customer service skills. One of the employees took my order over the phone and ran my card twice. I called back to see how the charges would be reversed to my card and spoke with Sarah the manager. First she didn't apologize or acknowledge her employee dropped the ball and charged me. She blamed my bank, like are you stupid or retarded my bank has nothing to do with your employee authorizing a charge that should have not went through. I contacted Wells Fargo to submit a claim after speaking with her she was so rude. When the delivery guy came my order was messed up. I specifically told the employee I want the same two large pizzas with three toppings like I had the night before with no garlic brush on the pizza crust. My husband calls back and the same girl that took my order over the phone answers and swears I didn't tell her no garlic brush but we always order that it's on the system. Can't believe she lied like that. My husband asked for the manager he was put on hold she gets back on the phone says the manager is busy. My husband told her no put her on the phone. Sarah the manager gets on the phone and asks what the problem is we had to explain the order was wrong once again she says it's our fault and says all she can do is give us free pizza but still argues it was my fault . We had to pursuance her to throw in some brownies for the inconvenience. We asked for frosting she said that would be extra 0.50 she would have to charge my card. Are you serious ???? I will not order from this location ever again this is the last time I'm going through this with Dominos. I can't believe this is how they treat long time customers. I am taking my money some where else. Do yourself a favor and take my word for it Dominos sucks  Part 2 just got our delivery and no brownies is this manager seriously doing shit on purpose. We ended up sending the pizzas back. It already took 45 minutes for another fuck up. I'm hungry frustrated and have not eaten. Corporate needs to contact me right away this is unacceptable.  The delivery driver was rude also and laughed when my husband asked where the brownies were. She cussed at him and used a racial slur. As his witness I heard her say Nigga I'm going to get you. That's a threatening thing to say and just down right disgusting. Everyone needs to be fired at this location. I'm so upset I don't know what to do !"}
{"text":"Always just meh. For whatever reason I can never get delivery to my building which is annoying in itself (lots of other places deliver and I'm well within delivery range so I don't think it's a building issue, but a Dominos issue). Feta counts as two toppings and there's barely ever enough feta to consider it one.... Never friendly when I go in to pick up pizza, barely even acknowledge you're standing there. Probably time to find a new go-to."}
{"text":"They ALWAYS bring the perfect product, at the perfect temperature and the best flavorful pizzas we have ever had.   ALWAYS on time!!!    ENJOY"}
{"text":"Just went  to this location and the night manager had the store closed when the sign says they close at  12:00AM.  He came to the door and said they were closed when they really weren't!"}
{"text":"Maybe it was because it was Valentine's Day, maybe it was because of the rain, maybe it was because they were horribly disorganized and fully in the weeds. This rating is based solely on the disappointing experience we had and not on the food, because we never. Actually. Got. Any. Food.   Placed an online order, their cutesy little tracker said they were making our order. Got to the place 20 minutes later and they said it would still be 8 minutes. Paid. Waited. Someone came in and they told them six more minutes for them. Someone waiting was told ten more minutes. Twenty minutes after showing up and paying both of them were gone and someone comes in and they tell him 30-40 more minutes. To which he replies \"wait, for the pizza I ordered 40 minutes ago?\"  So, at this point, it's been 50 minutes since I ordered and I'm told it's going to be another ten minutes. He also says \"gee, I think I remember making that one.  No, wait, we'll make yours next\"  Forget that. I just told them to cancel my $30 order. Because if I'm going to have to wait 45 more minutes (at least) then I was initially promised, it's just not worth my time to wait any more. I may try Domino's again, but it sure as heck won't be this one.   PS. Little Caesar's was at least ready when I got there.   Domino's, you need to do better"}
{"text":"This by far is the second best pizza that i've gotten from Dominos....                                 The 1st had onions pepperoni & banana pepper rings! This one"}
{"text":"2 Medium Pizzas for 5.99 each. That was the special. I've always liked Domino's even when food critics were not on their side. I was not happy with my last order but I blame me. I am not the biggest fan of thin crust pizza unless it is wood oven baked. I wanted to try something different so I did but I just did not seem to like their version. I will tell you my Pizza's were hot and ready when promised. My food was fresh served with a friendly smile. I will return only to have hand toss crust."}
{"text":"Was this a typical chain? Or your friendly neighborhood corner Pizzeria, flavorful, done right, tasted yummy on tummy and for 22.00 a pizza, and amazement cluck with pineapple's and jalapenos baked on. Amazing driver, friendly, caring, and thankful.   Great pick easy delivery, and wonderful tasteful flavorful food.   Amazing!  Order yours today, and taste the difference."}
{"text":"Took 40 minutes for delivery when online said 22 minutes, tracking online couldn't find my order, pizza was burnt & wings came with the wrong sauce."}
{"text":"This Dominos needs to be closed. After 40 minutes I ended up calling them, they told me they had no delivery drivers and didn't know when they would have one available. Didn't even want to give me a partial refund even though I had been waiting an hour. Didn't want to comp the pizza even though it had been sitting 40 minutes, and we sent someone to pick it up after over an hour of waiting. Waste of time and gas.  Worst experience with Dominos ever in my life. They need to close it for the sake of their franchise's reputation. They left us hungry and pissed off."}
{"text":"I went there today with my friends and he ordered a chicken pizza. We went home tried it around 10 pm. after 20 mins, i started feeling iting and so did my friends as well. I got pimples on my face and my friends had itching on face and all over the body. This place is such a joke. Please take your business else where. I didnt wanted to write a negative review but i wanted the world to know. I have emailed them before about customer service at customer first but they dont even call customer back neither reply to the email. So the owner - dont give me bullshit - customersfirst, please email and we will get back to you. Because you won't. A truly disappointing experience"}
{"text":"I do not recommend ever ordering delivery from this location. I decided to give them another chance because the first time I ordered it was football Sunday, took over 2 hours to receive my pizza and it was delivered cold. This time, I was estimated a 28-38 min delivery time. I placed my order at 6:07. It was taken out of the oven at 6:25. I didn't receive my order until 7:25. I called the location right before it arrived and they assured me it would be warm because they keep it under a heating lamp. I have worked in a pizza place. A pizza does not hold up for half a hour under a heating lamp and half a hour in a bag out for delivery. The manager, Sandra, is equally as rude and refused to do anything about the experience. I have complained to corporate and they can't do anything because this is a privately owned business. If you want pizza, you are better off going across the street and getting one from Little Caesars."}
{"text":"Awsome, Awsome, Awsome! At work we usually get pizza once a week and I have yet to have a bad pizza from here.  Even ordering online is a great experience.  I call and ask for the pizza at a certain time and it is ready, I order online and it is ready on time every time.  The pizza is also fantastic!  The staff in friendly and very respectful.  These guys were concerned on day i walked in because the Manager walked by and the open sign was not on and both employees were so apologetic.  You never see that anymore. I really enjoy ordering there and look forward to pizza day."}
{"text":"If you took the worst freaks from a Rob Zombie movie, and they had kids, that would look about like the freaks that work at this location. I ordered online at 5:45pm from work on the dot, also requested Pizzas to be ready at 6:30pm, which was an option at the end. I show up at 6:30pm, only to receive the blankest dear in headlights look I've seen in a long time. Oh, well it says here that you didn't place the order till 6:15 sir? So now I'm a liar. This place is pathetic."}
{"text":"Domino's Pizza  is my all time favourite pizza . However this pizza I got from this Maryland location was horrible . It was salty , dry and hard . We was not brought any sauce along with our pizza .I can't believe I wasted our lunch time meal on this nonsense . Disappointed . I want a refund ."}
{"text":"I don't consider myself a prude when it comes to tasty food, though I have to admit I was a little reluctant to review Domino's Pizza for fear someone I know might actually see it! But, I'll get over it.   I have recommended the thin and crispy pizza to many of my friends over the years, and the same thing invariably happens when I do. Their faces grimace and they look at me like \"what in the heck are you talking about? I'm not ordering from Dominos!\" OK fine don't, but guess what? It's pretty damn good!   I've had plenty of pizzas from plenty of restaurants over the years, and my \"go to\" delivery of choice is Domino's thin and crispy. Plus, their wings with Mango Habenero sauce are awesome, too.   The pizza is just as described, thin and crispy. It's reminiscent of the flatbreads that you'll pay triple for in trendy restaurants. Just keep the toppings simple and few or the crust will get soggy.  Great job, Dominos!"}
{"text":"Would Not Recommend  I used too work for Domin's when I lived in Pgh. and we had very high standards for quality and service.  Both are missing here.  I've ordered twice for delivery and when the pizzas finallly showed up, they were cold and soggy and I live about 1 mile away.  Ordered for pickup, one large cheese, one large pepperoni and one large three topping for pick up.  Not only was it not ready when they said it would be, still ended up with a soggy pizza and it was just out of the oven.  Over the years, in part because I did work for them at one time, I have eaten at many a Domino's.  This one has a way to go to meet Domino's Standards for Qualtiy and Service unless those standards had been downgraded significantly since I worked for Domino's and I don''t think that is the case."}
{"text":"I don't normally order from this chain but it seems to be close to where I live...not the best choice the pizza looked like I asked for lite cheeses and extra sauce which I definitely didn't. It was ok even my 9 and 6 year old weren't happy with the quality, but were hungry and didn't want to wait for another one...smh will definitely choose a different option, should have read the review"}
{"text":"Been to this takeout location once, it's quite hidden as it's found in the corner plaza under the bridge roundabout and parking is limited.   This was a takeout only location with a small bar style dining table and stools. It's better to do a pick up only.   I ordered the Thin Crust / cookie crust Pizza after hearing good things about it. It tasted good, but far from the authentic style Pizza or even oven bake crust pizza. Seemed a little... processed.   Overall it was worth the try but for takeout Pizza, I'll stick with Pizza Nova or Mamma's next time."}
{"text":"Had to give this location one star, but they don't even deserve this.  Don't fall for their 50% Off Coupon either! I tried to place this order online, FOUR Times!! and order would not go through.  Called the Desert Foothills location and spoke with the location Manager, Steve Gibson and his response was \"oh well, I can't honor this coupon unless you place the order online, Sorry!\" I don't think I patronize this business as it is apparent they don't want my business! I will give my business to Barro's, whose pizza is much better and same price. ."}
{"text":"Ashley treated me to dinner a few nights ago. She ordered a pizza from Dominos. First time I had a pizza since completing my strict diet.  Well, I must have been hungry because it was good to me. We had a pepperoni pizza with extra cheese. We also had garlic bread with marinara sauce. I must say I enjoyed the bread more than the pizza. Never been a big fan of Dominos pizza. It was ok for what it's worth."}
{"text":"So the delivery was really fast and the pizza was delicious! Definitely recommend this place :)"}
{"text":"Ordered delivery a few nights ago with my boyfriend. I ordered a bacon mushroom pan pizza with 8 wings and extra ranch.   It took over an hour to get here, I paid for an extra ranch and didn't get it, the sauce was only in the middle of the pizza and the cheese was all over. The wings were really soggy and fatty and we didn't get a full 8.   I've ordered from this dominos before and this is the first time I've had issues. I was very disappointed and didn't enjoy or receive everything I paid for."}
{"text":"Who goes into an actual pizza place these days? That's right this guy. I think that we actually caught the place off guard. Anyway, after battling the urge to order one of everything we finally got it dialed in. The guy at the register was really patient despite me asking him a tone of useless questions.  The artisan flatbread pizza is super tasty. I mean it, seriously... at 7 bucks they are giving it away. Plus i cant resist a slice of pizza thats cut into a square. Ill take one center piece one corner piece please :)  Ill admit it i'm a fan of pizza hut (its all about the stuffed crust), but Dominoes is on to something with this Artisan stuff. I also ordered the california chicken and bacon pizza. That thing was freaking great. If i do order dominoes again ill be ordering one of those."}
{"text":"We had done business with this dominos multiple times never had an issue taking a business check but now they say they won't guess I'll take an entire companies order for 6 pizzas somewhere else"}
{"text":"After my last experience I was done with Domino's.  Well after a nice phone call from the manager I believe his name was Jacob. He made everything right and fixed the issue. Tonight we tried them again and everything was perfect there were no issues at all. Will order from them again in the future."}
{"text":"Went online for the half off special. It was delivered in a fair amount of time, BUT the thin crust I ordered was not \"thin\", the extra cheese I was not much \"extra\", the black olives I added was just a \"sprinkle\" of olives. SO this is the LAST time I order from this place."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I enjoy their philly cheese steak pizza. We called to do a carry out order. The guy that answered the phone didn't seem to know what he was doing. I had to ask him 3 times what the difference in price was for a medium philly cheese steak or a large philly cheese steak. His response was the word \"um\" in which he easily used 10 times within a minute. He just kept saying um. And after asking over and over he was like,  um what?  You wanna know how much 1 philly cheese steak pizza is? Finally he says oh a medium is $10 and a large is $16. So we ordered the medium. Each time he needed to ask us a question,  like are you paying cash or cc and can i have a name, it was a project for him. A real struggle. We go pick up the pizza and he charges us $15. So we are like,  we just called and you said $10. Oh, um.. um.. um.. I must've told you the price for a small. A manager comes out and totally brushes the situation off and is like no a medium specialty is $15. We told him that we called and specifically asked the price and was told $10. He honestly didn't really care, was unapologetic and just walked away. AWFUL CUSTOMER SERVICE. Ordering a pizza over the phone shouldn't be so hard and knowing your prices and product is important. And if your going to have a new person answer the phone,  give them a price list, train them or tell them to ask whatever they don't know. There's plenty of places in the area to order pizzas from,  treating your customers bad for your mistake and negligence isn't a great way to run your business. In the future we will definitely go some where else."}
{"text":"I love the customer service at this location. My food is always hot and fresh. I ordered a small veggie pizza tonight and every bite was delicious."}
{"text":"Worst service. Overcharged - and lied to over and over again while the delivery guy tried to think of a reason to stick. There is no reason a medium pizza that's 14.99 on your website should come to $25 before tip - especially when that's not what I was quoted on the phone.   My own fault for ordering from dominos in a moment of apartment packing craziness."}
{"text":"This is literally the worst Dominos location I've ever been to. It used to be quite good as they used to have staff that also worked at Honest Ed's. In about a dozen past visits, I find that the guys that work there have really god awful B.O and it's just plain disgusting in such a small confined space. In addition to this, one specific young woman who takes orders with a thick Indian accent is both incompetent and rude in the worst way. It's one thing to take my $20 for a medium specialty pizza, but it's another to completely mess up the order and follow that up with an attitude. You're better off requesting the manager/owner when you take an order to make sure it's actually the correct pizza before waiting half an hour."}
{"text":"Quick delivery. Food hot. Delivery person friendly.  Very satisfied.  Love this store!!!"}
{"text":"Went from hating dominoes to loving it the most when they changed their entire recipe. However, in past several visits, I've discovered they no longer provide crushed red peppers and charge for the very first sauce if you get bread bites or parmesan cheese. I stopped going and changed to Rays pizza, so please let me know when dominoes changes the fixin's issue or explain this. Thanks!"}
{"text":"Our family loves the Brooklyn style pizza, but every time we would order from this place, there would be something wrong with the order. Stuff as minor as the pie being cut incorrectly, to stuff like a strange, unidentifiable orange substance covering most of the pizza. (not grease-because it wasn't blottable) The managers were VERY helpful in remedying the various situations, but this happened so many times in a row, that we had to stop ordering from this location. Mostly because we knew after food was delivered, we knew we would have to call the location about SOMETHING, while our order would get remade, and we wouldn't receive our correct order until hours after the original order was placed. Closing thoughts from this reviewer who spent 10 years in the pizza business: if you are into mediocrity, this is the place for you."}
{"text":"If I could give them a negative I would. Pizza is our guilty pleasure for when I don't feel like cooking dinner & even though the food has always been good when we order from here the customer service last night was so disgusting that I'll pass on ordering from here again. I always order online and I always put for the driver to knock lightly as my baby is sleeping. They are usually good about it, but the last few times they've been really loud when knocking. I forgot to order a drink so I called the store to add it on & I just mentioned to the guy who answered if he could just please make sure they knock lightly. I mean you do want customer feedback is that not right? He got offended that I said that even though I was very polite about it & made a comment like oh they need to knock a little harder sometimes blah blah in a rude annoyed way. Btw there is a difference between a loud bang knock and a soft knock. I'm sure he doesn't know that though. I explained to him obviously I need to be able to hear it, but they were always good about it until the last 2/3 times I've ordered they've knocked really loud. I mean how hard is it to just say okay and let your driver know that??? Prick. That wasn't even the big deal, the driver didn't knock lightly the stupid girl rang the doorbell and I'm 100% it was on purpose. It's also the same girl who delivered to me a couple weeks ago & my change was supposed to be $7, but I was in a hurry & she just gave me $4 back (me not thinking told her to keep it) so she took herself a $3 tip plus the $4 I was giving her for what I thought was too. I'll be contacting corporate today to make a complaint too."}
{"text":"DO NOT GET ANY FOOD FROM THIS PLACE!!  I got a hand made pepperoni and sausage pizza on 6-21-15 from this place around 7pm.  I ate 3 or 4 slices, watched some tv and went to bed.  I woke up around midnight with the worst stomach pain.  Needless to I was food poisoned and spent the next hour off and on the toilet puking and with asspocolypse!  Fair warning my friends..  Avoid this place at all costs."}
{"text":"We ordered two pizzas and a pasta bowl to our hotel room in the early hours of November 13, 2017. The food was delivered in a reasonable amount of time and tasted okay, but it appears that the driver added a $4 tip onto my card after we gave him one in cash. If you must order from here, i would advise paying for your order in cash."}
{"text":"Wish I could give a Zero to negative five review of this location. Called to talk to a manager who actually laughed at my complaint.  Wow! way to respect and do business.  The driver was rude and the 'so called Manager' Was way worse.  Never again and I pray you go out of business soon.  Not worthier of doing business in this community."}
{"text":"This Dominos never delivered anything to me. Ordered a pizza around 6pm yesterday. Called for update at 7:15pm, told me it was \"out their door\" at 720pm. By 9pm, I was eating McDonald's and calling my bank to reserve the charge.  Didn't even get a phone call. If could give negative stars, I would."}
{"text":"I really appreciate your hardworking. And giving us fast delivery with hot fresh food . Chain up always, Dominos is 5 starts. I will definitely recommend to my neighborhood"}
{"text":"I usually don't like to review fast food chains but I thought this place deserved a review because of the great customer service.  I ordered a Canadian pizza (my fave) using the online ordering system.  I ordered it in the morning for it to be ready in the evening.  7:15pm to be exact.  I ended up arriving early, just before 7, to find the pizza wasn't ready.  Totally understandable as I was the one that was early.  One of the guy's working that night got to work right away on the pizza and told me it would only take about 8 minutes.  As promised the pizza was ready in less than 10 minutes.  During this whole time both guys were very friendly and cheerful.  It's good to know they make the pizzas around the time they are meant to be ready and don't have them sitting out for a long period of time.  Oh also, I've noticed sometimes Domino's sauce can be too acidic but this time it was just perfect!  The cheese and toppings were also just right!"}
{"text":"Not the first time I've ordered from this dominos.  And I have TRIED to give drivers chance to make sure order is complete.  Now 3rd time I've had tsk out. And I SPECIFICALLY asked the driver if sauces I paid for extra were there..... THEY WERE NOT. AGAIN. ITS almost turning into a joke. Pizza is ok.  Not worth paying money for things I'm not receiving..... THREE TIMES  WTF"}
{"text":"I would give zero stars if I could...I ordered a pizza, an hour and a half ago. Called to see where it was...the guy who answered was pleasant and said he'd give me a credit for another time and to call when my pizza finally arrives, about 25 mins later I get my pizza (that's about 2 hours after I ordered it)...I called the store back...he said I'm glad you got your pizza, got the name of the driver (shouldn't he already know that information?) and then hung up! No apologizes, no I'll get you your credit...just hung up! I won't ever order from this place again!!!!!"}
{"text":"I have recently ordered delivery and I am actually impressed with their pizza. They are actually decent and if you get the pizza with different toppings, they are pretty good. But what i like about this store is that they have FAST delivery!! It takes them usually 30 mins to deliver, and I'm impressed with that! Come here for good pizza and fast delivery services!!"}
{"text":"Don't you dear to order from this place  I order it at 6pm the pizza didn't show up till 7:12pm The don't care about the costumers When I call to speak with manager he didn't had much to say  I think dominos pizza don't respect her costumers  I'm never going to order from them again  Just a shame"}
{"text":"We always order from this Domino's. The delivery drivers are awesome the are on time and polite. I love ordering online the pizza tracker is very helpful, my son likes to watch it because it tells him how long it will take for the pizza to get here.  The pizza was great it was hot and fresh! Great service which gave a great tip. The pizza arrived earlier then what it said but I am not complaining."}
{"text":"I've been meaning to write this for a while but keep forgetting... one Friday night, I went in with my daughter to pick up our carryout order. The manager on duty was straight up yelling and rude to the other employees and the poor employees just had to stand there and take it. I understand it's Friday, there's a lot of orders, and it's hectic as hell. But watching someone be that disrespectful and condescending was hard to watch. I patiently waited for someone to ask me what I was in there for and the poor guy just looked worn out. I asked him what the awful manager's name was. It was Joel. Hope he doesn't work there anymore. Or at least has received some sensitivity training. Oh yeah - pizzas are fine. Lol"}
{"text":"Ordered a large pizza. PAID FOR IT. Was told that the pizza would be ready in 15 minutes. 20 minutes later I was told that the person forgot to punch in the order. FORGOT!!! There was no explanation. I was given a dipping sauce as apology. I ve never seen such appalling service anywhere over Canada. Doesn't deserve even the 1 star.  HOW THE HELL DO YOU FORGET!??? That's what you do for a job for gods sake!!"}
{"text":"I was giving this location on last chance, and once again it was a fail. Burnt pizza and bread, ordered and paid for sauces didn't get any of them. Just sad. We are just big pizza lovers but they will never get our business again. Even my making up for mistake orders have been off. They just simply don't have people working there that care at all. Every platform I have seen has bad reviews. Hopefully one day the owner will actually realized and change their staff accordingly or management will care even."}
{"text":"Dominos isn't gourmet pizza but it's usually OK; not this location! I ordered a thin crust with a extra onions and double olives. Delivery was fast and delivery person Traci was sweet but the pizza sucked. There were a few scattered olives but no \"double\" olives for which I was charged. Rip-off! We also ordered a pan cheese pizza that was good."}
{"text":"If you want your pizza made & delivered by stoners you have come to the right place. Compared to other Dominoes stores,  this one is one of the worst. They take no pride in making their pizza."}
{"text":"We ordered last night, 14 wings and two medium pizza's. I was not impressed, the sauce was super spicey on the wings pretty unbearable, i asked if they are super spicy, and he indicated nope they are really good. Crust had no taste, and niether did the sauce. Why can't they get it right. Pizza was sort of cold, and wings were really sticking to the aluminum foil. Pulled off most of the skin. Terrible."}
{"text":"Friendly delivery people .. even after they couldn't find the house.  Pizza was still hot and good :)  Wish I could type more details for the drivers to help them find the house.  Thanks again for great service in the Tega Cay SC area."}
{"text":"Couldn't resist the price of eight bucks,  with the coupon code that came in the mail flyer, for a large pie with up to 10 toppings. And it was really easy to order online. That's where the good part ends.  The deal mentioned above was not good for delivery, so my husband went to pick it up. We had made a specific time for it to be ready for pickup, but he had to wait a few minutes - no big deal. Brought it home to my excited growling tummy... I had ordered it with \"robust tomato sauce\". We couldn't even tell if the pizza even had any sauce on it. Bleh. I had ordered the regular \"hand-tossed\" crust - but the crust was so salty and greasy it was almost inedible. We really like lots of toppings, but there was maybe one tiny piece of each topping on each slice, some with none at all.   I miss the Dominoes that used to be close to our old house - they seemed to be able to make a much better pizza for some reason. I think if we do order Dominoes again (because the eight buck pizza is really tempting), we'll try another location."}
{"text":"I disliked the old Domino's Pizza, but I actually really like the new Domino's Pizza with the better sauce, better cheese and garlic crust.   Ordering is easy, coupons galore, delivery is usually under the time quoted.   I ordered the Hot Hawaiian with ham, pineapple, jalapenos and hot sauce - so good and all the ingredients tasted very fresh.  This is my local pizza joint until I move - so I order from them if I don't want to go out.   I'll eat their pizza again!"}
{"text":"I use to love this dominos. They were great! Now I'm paying $17 for a $8 carryout deal.... Yeah outrageous"}
{"text":"After last night I will never order from any domino's again. Joel, their manager is incompetent and rude. The store manager, Brandon, is no better. How dare you call a customer just to argue with them? Yet you offer no solutions. What an immature little sh*t. I have no idea why they would make either of these children management."}
{"text":"The worst experience I could have with an order. It took one hour for the pizza and sandwich to arrive when I did receive it it was cold. I called the store and I spoke with a Casey and she basically told me it was under a heat lamp so its not cold. She hesitated as if I was supposed to just eat it and deal with it. I told her I wanted a credit for this order and I guess I'll see when my credit card statement comes to see if I did get my refund"}
{"text":"I'm pretty sure this location has some type of allergy to sauce because they absolutely refuse to put it on ANY pizza or include it with any type of breadstick or carb like substance. Can somebody verify that this place even has marinara sauce? Or is it some type of sick twisted joke that likes to torture people with dry @$$ food?"}
{"text":"I honestly don't get all the negative reviews for this place. Granted, I never order delivery. I always order it online and just zip on down there and pick it up 30 minutes later. I have never had a problem with this place.   As for the pizza itsself, as far as chains go, I feel its better than Pizza Hut or Papa Johns. They have the thick crusts that I like and every pizza I've grabbed from here has been pretty tasty, especially considering the price point.  When I go to pick up and pay, the employees at the site have always been reasonably friendly. Granted, its no Grimaldi's, but it beats the hell out of Pizza Hut, Papa Johns, and Little Caesars IMO.   So until something bad happens, I will continue to give this place my business. I have no reason why I wouldn't reccommed it.    3.5 stars."}
{"text":"I like this particular Dominos. They have a setup that lets the customers clearly see the food prep. They're reasonably fast and make very yummy pizza. Also, their website is pretty great for ordering online. Be sure to check out their coupon section when you order, as they have deals."}
{"text":"This place is the Absolute worst when it comes to customer service the CSR's there have no idea what they're doing took me 3 1/2 hours for two medium pizzas and it still never showed up talk to the manager George and he was no help either this place is a joke"}
{"text":"This is my go to pizza joint around the block. I love the pizzas here compared to the local pizza pizza. I highly recommend the Philly cheese steak pizza. Comes with provolone cheese, steak, mushrooms, onions and based with a cream sauce. Mmmm delicious! You can also order online and track when it is ready, this way you don't need to go there and wait. There's always promotion like 50% off speciality pizzas. I would definitely come back here again!"}
{"text":"I've ordered take-out here many times before. I prefer my pizza lightly done, and more often than not, this particular location always manages to bake the pizza a little too much, such that the cheese and bread gets burnt and it's more \"well done\" than \"lightly done\". I've tried other Domino's locations before, and they don't have this problem. Also, this place seems to be particularly stingy with toppings and sauce. There were probably like 5 spinach leaves on the previous pizza with spinach topping I ordered, and barely any pizza sauce. Not impressed."}
{"text":"Very good pizza!! Test very good and fresh!! I order here a lot and never had bad food. They always make the pizzas very quick. I always order online."}
{"text":"When you order online you can review your experience. I usually have a good experience & i like to review that. The last time my stuffed cheesy bread was disgusting, smaller than normal & not cooked all the way. I reviewed & never heard back. A good company usually responds to apologize. That was the 1st time ive been dissatisfied so i ordered again today. The stuffed cheesy bread again was not good. The cheese was clumpy, not melted, & just plain goop. I always order the stuffed cheesy bread & know how its supposed to look & taste. I will no longer be ordering from this location. After reading the reviews, i hope this location gets it together. They do usually deliver in a timely manner. Today was slower than normal though which is a little weird for a Monday at 11am. I guess i need read reviews more often for regular ol food chains cause some locaions apparently can't cook food the same as otger locations."}
{"text":"Fast and good!  I'm from Cali and this is the pizza place we always go to!  Good costumer service and nice people.  Believe I'm a big believer in costumer service and good food!  Best combination!"}
{"text":"So I've been a pretty regular orderer from this Domino's. Over the years, I have had good and okay service with this Domino's. But, I have finally found the pizza that I love in everyway and I want to shout it from the mountain tops....It's a pizza that everyone should try.  I started ordering their homemade pan pizza with spinach and ham and white sauce (indigestion kicks in with too much red sauce) and it is fabulous. Can't say it enough. You can choose any two toppings, but this pizza is perfect and their service has way improved lately."}
{"text":"I ordered pizza & boneless chicken on-line and had it delivered. I ordered using Shop-Runner for free delivery.The delivery person was fast & friendly.The food was tasty & of a high standard. I added parmesan cheese & red pepper flakes and they came in round containers which was far superior to the free packets I've been used to. Definitely recommend this Domino's!"}
{"text":"I hate pizza but their breadbowl chicken Alfredo is bomb af. But dominos is super overpriced even with coupons. It's like $20 for one person."}
{"text":"1 star for quick delivery. Got my order wrong on the first time and the second time I ordered I asked for thin crust and got regular. Person over the phone spoke poor English and i spelled out word thin and after 3 times of confirmation, they made my pizza wrong. My fault for not checking I guess, never using them again. I like dominions this location is poor though."}
{"text":"We went here because I was craving the stuffed bread with bacon, cheese, and jalapenos.  It has been a few weeks now, but they were super busy, super friendly, seemed short staffed and still got our food within a reasonable amount of time.  Would have been all stars but my bread was a little overdone."}
{"text":"One star only because I had to give you something, to write this review .Attention everyone do not go to this dominos they steal you debit/credit info and withdrawal and make charges in your account. When you call the location they act so nonchalant about it remember stealing from the bank is a federal offense yes people they withdrew 500  dollars from my son's . For dominos sakes I hope they give the cops the information needed and we will also be getting a hold of the news I'm sure he wasn't the first this has happened to and if dominos keeps these theives as they're well then what does that tell us about domino's hope this helps anyone they rang his card the same day of his original purchase 5/23/16 and then had the nerve to withdrawal 500 bucks today 5/29/16  from a bank of America BEWARE AND STAY AWAY !!!!"}
{"text":"Great shop... quick and always good... I get the take out special and shop at the grocery store while I wait"}
{"text":"They are usually pretty awesome but I literally just opened my cinnamon sticks and they gave me ranch to dip them in. So disgusting and complacent. I'm extremely disappointed."}
{"text":"First off, I come inside the store, the two guys in the front, one was a delivery guy,  as in right in front of me on the other side of the counter looked at me then ignored my presence, it was the young gentleman in the back that showed good manners and welcomed me to Dominoes and asked if I mind waiting a few moments, so I said sure, go ahead, I can see he was multitasking. While this was going on, others have entered. So now one of the men that ignored me from the beginning decides to come up to the register to speak, not with me to take my order, but with the gentleman behind me to assist him. The gentleman quickly corrected him stating I've been waiting first in line, which the employee already knew originally as I was the only previous customer.  I did not like his unprofessionalism in dealing with me.  Something clearly wasn't right about this person.  Onto the food. The Italian sandwich was good, the cinnamon bread was good, however the Chicken Alfredo, take a look at the picture, for the money I paid, was expecting it to come a little more closer to the top, plus there was two types of chicken used in this dish, one seemingly artificial.   3 stars to the nice employee that acknowledged me, otherwise it would've been less, like 1."}
{"text":"It was a late night and the wife has been bugging me to go here since her co-workers have been raving about this chain. I should have used my better judgement and kept driving so I'm giving myself two stars on this dining decision.  We ordered the $7.99 large pizza special along with the $2.99 Parmesan Bread. I ate two slices of pizza when we got home. The rest of it is still in a freezer bag in the refrigerator several days later. Who doesn't finish up their pizza the next day? What does that tell you? Even my son commented the next morning that he tried a piece when he came home from work and gave it a \"B\" for brutal. The bread was excellent and saved me from going to bed hungry. I would have to say that the lady that was cashiering was helpful and knew what she was doing."}
{"text":"This pizza takes like CRAP! I order dominos all the time in LA and never tasted something so nasty! The ingredients must be weeks old! I ordered a chicken bacon pizza and it tasted like vomit. I also ordered a pepperoni but I am afraid to try it.  I tried calling to complain and there was no answer. This place needs a corporate visit because it gives Dominos a bad name."}
{"text":"Wasted an hour of my time because they never made my pizza, even though I checked on my order twice. They didn't even offer to discount my pizza. Canceled my order and went to Osaka grill next door (5/5). Thanks for nothing domino's."}
{"text":"Have given this place several tries, every single time we order we either get the wrong order or our pizza is completely burnt. Tried them again tonight, once again the pizza was burnt, the sandwich that we ordered was burnt, the sandwich was try overcooked Philly cheesesteak. Will never order from them again worst Domino's EVER!!!"}
{"text":"First time we tried Dominos. Easy, nearby, good taste, and we had a good coupon. Everything was good! I would not want to pay their normal prices though."}
{"text":"The worst, today I ordered a pizza from this terrible place had to wait an hr for my pizza the driver was really rude when I told her that I didn't want to pay for the pizza because simply no one I repeat NO ONE should have to wait a damn hr for a pizza. Called the manager \"jackass\" that our pizza should be free after the the long wait, he continued saying \"sorry if she's already there than theirs nothing I can do about, on your next order you can get a free pizza , uhh fuck a free pizza on my next order I even continued to tell him to remake the order he got more upset so when I told his a** I would report him to cooperate he says oh! My name is ****** lmao like bro yeah it's funny now but we'll see when your getting investigated for sorry a** management.."}
{"text":"I ordered Two small regular crust pizzas last night and they were pretty good. I called the store in advance and they picked up the phone really fast and my order was ready by 15m. Costomer service is okay but since it's a franchise you can't expect a costomer service you get by a new individual business!!"}
{"text":"I would love to complain about my pizza, but it never showed up. Was quoted a 52-62 minute wait. It's now been two hours. Tried to cancel, but no one answered their phone after 5 minutes. Maybe the closed? Hmmm. Only 8 pm ?"}
{"text":"I like this dominoes, their pizza is great, but they ALWAYS forget the extra marinara when they deliver. Always."}
{"text":"Who answers the phone at this place?....I had to hang up on the same person on two different occasions. Hard to believe this person is still employed. He had a very difficult  time with simple things such as spelling and pronunciation.... this got old and annoying very quickly! I could not make it through the whole conversation....not even past the part where I was trying to give him my address..he could not even handle that... twice!...This guy is surely doing nothing but damage to business at this location.....If anybody cares, he last answered my call on Friday night, Nov 22, 2013 Please fire this moron so I can have some pizza...until then I shall take my business elsewhere. I suggest somebody in management calls on his shift and poses as a customer, so they can see that this review is no exaggeration by any means. Sign him up for the special olympics."}
{"text":"I should have listened to the Google reviews. The pizza was made well and tasted fine. The wings were utterly disgusting. The sauce was watery and the wings where covered in chunks of fat. I got delivery which was fast. For a large 2 topping pizza, 10 wings, delivery taxes and a $2.50 tip, it all came to $30. Not worth it. I haven't had pizza in almost a year so I thought it was a good idea. I'll try another pizza place next time."}
{"text":"Took advantage of their promo from Feb 15-21 *Carry Out Special: Get a Medium 2-Topping Pizza for $5.99.  Order was made online. Navigating their site is very easy, and the food was ready in 10 minutes!  Their thin crust pizza crust is the best!  Will be coming back for sure, especially when they continue having specials like these.    Review 19 of 100"}
{"text":"Honestly I'd give it zero stars if I could, ordered a Chicken Alfredo Bread Bowl and the Chicken came to me ice cold, I called and the girl who answered the phone, her name was Bianca was rude and inconsiderate, and had zero empathy for the situation, won't be ordering from here again"}
{"text":"This Dominos makes BOMB PIZZA!! I always get thin crust BC I am not ordering pizza to eat a mouth full of Dough!I've NEVER had a bad pizza from this store. Brody & the rest of the staff are very cool & polite ( & know my order-that's pretty bad actually lolol) . Anyhow, everything is ALWAYS FRESH & HOT!!! They always tell me that my pizza will be delivered 28 minutes or more. YA RIGHT!! 10 minutes later they are already at my door!! NO JOKE!! Always bring me the Parmesan & Red pepper that I request. One time there was a misunderstanding & did not bring my parmesan. They had ALREADY delivered obviously & this store is ALWAYS SLAMMED , but insisted on bringing me my parmesan!! So, it's never like \"Well, I got my tip, so she can suc an egg\"! I am obviously a faithful patron & it's only BC the pizza truly is good&the 2 medium $5.99 special makes it All the better! LOVVVVE THE LAVA CAKE!! It b DA BOMB BABY!!"}
{"text":"We ordered this online at work today for lunch, a large 3-topping (pepperoni, sausage, and ham).  The estimated time was within 40 minutes and we had it in about 25-30.  The pizza was hot and fresh with a nice crisp crust.  The delivery driver was friendly as well.  Overall, had a great experience and would order from here again."}
{"text":"I love Dominoes, and I USUALLY like this location, but I will not be ordering from this store again after tonight. We spent $30 on two pizzas and stuffed cheesy bread, and both pizzas were prepared wrong. The pizza we ordered for our children was supposed to be half pepperoni and half bacon... and they skipped the bacon entirely. Our pizza should have been Italian sausage and black olives... And they didn't put on any sausage. I also paid the stupid extra fee for a cup of marinara sauce for the cheesy bread... No marinara. All of this could have been solved nicely if the manager had simply gotten on the phone when we called and helped right the wrongs... But he didn't. He yelled at his employee from across the room what to say to us and made the poor kid be the middle man for the whole conversation. Refused to refund us or do anything to remedy the situation. Sorry Dominoes. You lost four customers today."}
{"text":"The worst Dominos ever!  Waited over 2 hrs for pizza and gave them the orde twice only for them to get it wrong twice.  The rolled eyes \"I'm sorry\" was the icing on the cake.  The owner better look in to who they have managing this place because it is a sorry excuse for a Dominos and corporate should be ashamed to allow them to use their name."}
{"text":"I have had great experiences with this dominoes. Even when we get delivery, the pizza is always still very hot. The drivers are always courteous and professional. I'm not big on chain pizza but this dominoes really does a great job!"}
{"text":"I ordered 2 medium Pan Pizza's and an order of Chicken at 6:52 PM, and waited until 7:55 PM to call and see where my order was. They said that their driver was out on the road with the delivery. We live about less than 10 minutes away, so after another 15 minutes of waiting, I call them again, only for them to transfer me to two different people. One of them told me that once the pizza was done cooking, they would get it out to us ASAP. I told him the last time we called, they said it was already on the road to which he had no clue what was going on, but was told to wait another 15 minutes before calling again. What a bunch of crap. I guess it's better to just pick it up from this location because clearly they have no clue how to manage to go orders."}
{"text":"This Pizza is absolutely amazing!!!! Philly Cheese Steak! Cooked to perfection! There's not a pizza place in Brampton that compares to Dominos right now."}
{"text":"WARNING!!! This place is ridiculously understaffed.. Order took an hour to get ready, sitting there waiting for delivery for like 40 mins... no drivers to deliver is what they said when I called. Do not order from here unless ready to wait like 2 hours.  Manager if you reading this.. gotta do something buddy."}
{"text":"Je ne peux pas vous dire si les pizzas sont excellentes à ce domino's pizza, car hier soir j'ai commandé 2 pizzas ( 4fromages, poulet barbecue...) Que j'attend toujours ... et je rappel pour savoir où est le livreur ou autres 1h après et je suis tombé sur une dame désagréable qui m'a carrément dit que le livreur n'avait pas trouvé mon adresse,donc je lui demande pourquoi elle m'a pas pas me rappeler pour me prévenir ... enfin bref je n'ai pas apprécié comment on m'a parlé donc je ne commanderai plus de pizza à ce domino's la"}
{"text":"Deuxieme expérience doninos à Montréal et cette fois j'ai reçu mes pizzas mais alors quand appelé pour commander j'ai eu l'impression de parler avec un ami d'enfance aucune politesse, le respect n'en parlons pas, il a fallu que je rappel qui était le client dans l'histoire pour que la personne reprenne son rôle de SERVICE...  bref pour le prix des pizzas et le service j'irai ailleurs ."}
{"text":"I had not had Domino's pizza in YEARS! And if ordered from a pizza chain it was always Pizza Hut. But THIS particular Domino's changed all that! My roommate had ordered from them and I was like really??? But when I grabbed  a slice and hesitantly took a bite, I was very pleased! I ordered after that through their online app and love how it tells you when they start and it keeps updating you on the status of your order until it arrives. I have NEVER been disappointed on any of the orders I have placed. The pizza toppings always have plenty even if it's just a 2 topping pizza the whole thing is covered. I have picked up from a different location after calling in an order, and will never go to or order from that location again (43rd/Glendale) the way they made the pizza and how I received it was exactly why had not bought from them in such a long time.   Pizza always looks too good to eat (perfect) and is delivered in a short amount of time, again I LOVE THE APP and the updates on your order.  *YOU GUYS ROCK!* KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK!"}
{"text":"Be aware!!! If I could put negative stars I would do it! I went to order a pizza and the person that took my money and gave me change he then went in the kitchen and start preparing the pizza with his dirty hands!!! Now I understand why in some other reviews people got sick after eating their pizza!!! Be aware!!!"}
{"text":"I had a delivery for a couple of large pizza's and wings. It was fresh, hot and good. The driver was on time. I will order again."}
{"text":"I had complained about an incorrect order and Dominos stepped up and turned this one around.  Unbelievably great commitment to customer satisfaction that is much appreciated.  It also reminded me of the nice garlic flavor they have on the edge of each pizza crust, that is tasty and I haven't found elsewhere.    Thank you"}
{"text":"Delicious Pizza! I have not had Dominos for a decade but I can say it was totally worth driving to the Westside for their delectable pizzas."}
{"text":"Don't go here! I came to pick up my pizza and the place looked clean inside but I noticed the pizza makers weren't wearing gloves! And at one point one of them took out their cell phone to check it! And didn't wash his hands afterwards... The cashier was the only friendly one who actually greeted me but I noticed he had long nails, considering they don't use gloves, it's kind of terrifying to imagine him making my pizzas  Also, the man that appeared to be a manager didn't greet me at all and seemed rude. The pizza was ok but my fiancé was in the bathroom with a stomach ache after eating. Will not be returning."}
{"text":"Stow Domino's is our favorite pizza/wings go-to quick dinner. Even SUPER BOWL night! Ordered Domino's delicious pan pizza and boneless wings carryout via the app on my way home from work during the super bowl game expecting it to be a while, but not only was it ready in a whopping 7 minutes, it was perfect! Oh, and the app offers lots of coupons making our pan pizza $8.99 compared to $11.99! We love Stow Domino's"}
{"text":"I have no idea if I was really hungry but the pizza we got from here a few days ago was probably the best pizza I've had in a while. Everything was amazing."}
{"text":"Decided to try the whole \"New Domino's Pizza\" last night and was surprised by how good it was. A million times better than the old. The crust actually was good and soft more like a wood fired pizza than typical delivery pizza, and had a very good taste to it. It has some seasoning on it reminding me of Hungry Howies garlic herb crust just not as strong. The toppings were good but nothing spectacular (i had pepperoni, olive, and onion) the peperoni wasn't as greasy as i remembered it so it was good. Sauce had a good garlic tomato taste and way better than the bland old stuff.  Now the most important part for a review like this for any college student: the second day taste test. I had my leftovers for breakfast and it heated up in the toaster very well. The crust didn't get hard it stayed soft and edible. The toppings held their flavor and it was a really good slice of leftover pizza.  Overall verdict is that Domino's has come a long way no longer is it  in with the Little Cesar's and Pizza Hut's of the world but up a step into the class with Papa John's and Hungry Howies out there. I still will take Hungry Howies ahead most days for price and taste but Domino's has done enough to earn my business on occasion."}
{"text":"So slow. Ordered online hoping that by the time they alert me that my order is ready, still had to wait almost 30 minutes to get my pizza. I dont see customer in the store and staff is just running around pretending to be busy. Manager dont care if they see the customer waiting for so long. Also the phone continue to rang and no one bothered to answer. Maybe they are afraid to take orders or just dont want additional work. Sad. This place can make more money if the staff productivity will improve.   Ok never mind. They lost my order after waiting for an additional 30 mins. They did apologize and rush my order. Just hope that next time they pay attention closely to the order or just ask the customer for the tracking number to facilitate the process"}
{"text":"Gotta say I've order pizza from this location a few times now, and each time the pies were very well prepared and still hot when they arrived. It's Domino's so you know the flavor profile. I use their online order system and it's always correct. I'd recommend using it if you have internet access. Enjoy your next pizza night give them a call or order online you'll be happy with the pie and the value."}
{"text":"We ordered a pizza at 5:10, and we didn't get our pizza until 6:45. That is Completely Unacceptable! They never called to check with us, and the driver said he couldn't find my house, but never called to find out where I lived. If I could give 0 stars I would. Will NEVER order from them again!!"}
{"text":"This location is good. I order a few times a month and they are always quick. I have never had to wait over 15 minutes.   Check out their coupons first and you can order online to save....The Monday/Tuesday/Wednesday deal is the best for your dollar. 1 large 3 topping for $7.99, pick up only. With tax its $11. You can't get that anywhere else close"}
{"text":"After two hours I called and canceled my order. This is by far the worst dominos in the area. When I called the first time to cancel they put me on hold for five minutes before I hung up and called back. Don't ever order from this place. I will be calling corporate over this. Thanks for nothing."}
{"text":"The quality of the wings were poor-very fatty and not good at all. The pizza wasn't much better...definitely won't be ordering from Dominos again."}
{"text":"Although not my go to for pizza, they have yet to let me down when it comes to their pasta. Can get busy very quick and is obvious they're understaffed. Definitely need to call ahead when placing an order rather than relying on the tracker app for this particular location."}
{"text":"I had a pizza from this location recently. The staff was nice but I ended up getting sick off the food. I feel like I need an exorcism performed on my stomach to cast this evil out. It's been years since I've had Dominos pizza and I doubt after this experience I'll have it again."}
{"text":"I was contacted by the owner.. Nice touch that included a gift card! Woohoo! The owner understands the value of customers .. We pay the bills!!"}
{"text":"We stopped using this Domino's Pizza years ago because they would \"lose\" our order, get the order wrong, or not have the order ready when it was time to pick it up. We decided to give them another try this evening. I used the online order system for the first time. It was easy to use and the pizza ready at the time indicated on the order form. So how did it taste? It was OK. Not the best, and not the worst pizza we ever ate. The amount of pizza ingredients were average--not too skimpy, not too generous. The crust was OK, nothing special. Better than Little Caesars, about the same as Papa Johns for overall taste and quality.  Price was $5.99 for a two topping medium pizza. Parking was close to the door."}
{"text":"Time to party like a 4 year old! Yep, it's my granddaughter's 4th birthday and her dinner request was for pizza. Right now Domino's is selling 2 topping regular crust pizza for just $5.99. The two pizzas I picked up were perfectly done, just the right amount of toppings, sauce and crust, and done exactly when they said they would be.  I ordered online and the process was quick and easy and I got an email update as the pizza was being prepared. The staff was friendly and parking was close to the door. My granddaughter and the whole family was pleased with pizza."}
{"text":"I have done both here...picked up pizza from this location and had it delivered...for several years.  The staff is superb and, for whatever reason, they do a better job with their pizza than other Domino's locations I've tried.  I order online most of the time, and the process is so easy!  I love the tracker, which helps me gauge when the pizza will be on its way.  They are super fast!  Once the tracker shows they've left for delivery, they are here in 7-10 minutes...and yet the pizza arrives piping hot and DONE.  No corners are cut.  I love love love the thin, crispy crust, and typically order it with pineapple and ham.  My husband also enjoys the thin crust, but I always include a hand-tossed pepperoni and sausage pizza for him.  Recently we tried one of the new pasta dishes, which was very good.  They've added a lot of new items to the menu to increase our choices...but I still love the pizza best! Even though this is considered \"fast food\" pizza, it is just so darn good!  Have tried the competitors, but they can't compare.  Keep making great pizzas on Ray Road, and thank you for the consistency!"}
{"text":"I've never had a bad pizza from this location. Plus, they always have nice employees and quick service. Tonight I had a delivery driver named Daniel. He was kind, polite and timely. You da man, Dan!!! Thank you!"}
{"text":"The pizza is good, but the service could use some work.  I went to pick up a pizza which took them all of 15 min to prepare. When I arrived it took me 10 min to pay and get out of the door. There was only one person in front of me checking out. It seemed that they were more concerned with making pizzas for delivery and less concerned about the customer standing in front of them.   Once I tasted the hand-tossed pineapple and pepperoni pie all was forgiven. The improvements that they have made to the recipe working."}
{"text":"I've had dominos many times in the past and today this is the worst pizza I've ever had. It was burnt and dry.  Impossible to eat."}
{"text":"I ordered a pizza online.  Two hours later,still no pizza. I called the store multiple times and was hung up on every time.  Stay away! You have been warned!"}
{"text":"We ordered the 12 Piece classic hot buffalo wings and a large pizza. We ordered it online and we got it delivered very quickly and I loved that. But the chicken wings weren't as we expected... They seemed very small compared to what it seemed in the picture. And they tasted like chicken nuggets with just hot sauce on them. That was really my only complaint. However the pizza was perfecto."}
{"text":"Very good love this place fast service food is good cook is friendly she even stopped by my apt to see have the food I always order from here when I want pizza pan pizza the best desserts are great this place is a must try"}
{"text":"I love this place comes in clutch when I'm high although earlier today I ordered 2 pizzas to be delivered to my home and the driver nikola backed into my truck and left front end damage police weren't called because she paid for it"}
{"text":"Walked in and the lady just stood there with no acknowledgment of me at all.  Then their keyboard didn't work.  Just all around very super casual and non-chalant about me; their customer.  Kinda sad cuz it's the closest Dominos to me."}
{"text":"Less a location review, more a 'Domino's is the worst pizza ever' review. Seriously though, it is. Every two years or so, I get lazy enough into ordering this crud. This time around it was: 'There's a coupon!' 'It's new Brooklyn Style!' & 'They changed the sauce!'  Ordering online is easy. The tracker (which has annoying sfx) stops you from wondering where the 'za is. But ultimately, when it comes to your door, it still STINKS. Without a coup, this Brooklyn style, pacific veggie pizza was to run $17. By Brooklyn style, they mean 'we'll cut less slices so it seems bigger!' Otherwise, it was the same undercooked mealy crust as always. By pacific veggie, they mean 'we'll throw our usual 5-6 veggies that we always use on it'. And that new sauce? Tastes exactly the same as the old one. Boo. My fault for ordering it. If you're reading this, don't make the same mistake I did."}
{"text":"Didn't tell me toppings I ordered on my pizza were sold out until they delivered it-- I don't want /almost/ what I ordered, I want what I ordered. I wouldn't have purchased it if I had known, but I guess that's why they didn't tell me before I bought it. Displeased."}
{"text":"I got really bad food poisoning from the pepperoni and jalapeño pizza I ordered. I was trying to eat cheap on my vacation, and ended up spending most of it vomiting in my hotel room. They gave me a credit for the pizza, but I would avoid this place if you can."}
{"text":"What horrible customer service. I have used their app several times to place orders, and typically things go pretty smooth. Tonight was a much different story. I was following on the tracker, and saw when my order was completed. It then took another hour for my food to be delivered. It is a Thursday night and I had to wait just under an hour and 20 minutes for my delivery after being told it would be 25-35 min. Totally unacceptable. I think I will order from somewhere else in the future."}
{"text":"This is the worst dominos I have ever been to. Placed an order online and it said it would be ready in 15-25 minutes. Get to the location about 15 minutes after I ordered. The lady working said \"I haven't even started it, there's only two of us here. It'll be about 25 minutes before I get it stared\"  Since I was literally starving and it was 12am I was like whatever fine.  Waited almost an hour in the parking lot. For ONE PIZZA. I worked in a pizzeria for 7 YEARS and we hand tossed our own dough and a pizza took literally 10 minutes to cook.  I think the location is horribly under staffed and for a Saturday night you would think they would have more people working. I don't blame the employees but the management who allows their employees to suffer and be the bad guys.  15 dollars for a pizza and they wanted to charge extra for crushed red pepper. I'm gonna stick with Pizza Hut. Never have had an issue with them and my order is always ready super fast.   Avoid this location at all costs. Or dominos in general."}
{"text":"Found a hair in the pizza right after I found meat in the veggie pizza. The pizza was supposed to be vegetarian they gave us two pizza credits but that's not worth it because it was dry and had that gross piece of hair stuck in the cheese."}
{"text":"First time I've been there since they moved to their new location.  Now you have to walk all the way to the back of the store to pick up your order.  The music is blaring so loud the staff say that they can't hear you.  Order ready on time.  Skimpy toppings, so salty it makes your mouth hurt."}
{"text":"Love the food from this location! The Team is friendly and professional. The service is quick and consistent. My food is always prepared precisely to my liking. The online order process was easy and fun. I like that you can send a note to the person preparing your food. Bravo Domino's!"}
{"text":"I like Dominos. Total guilty pleasure food. But if your hours say you close at 1:00am, and I go to place an order at midnight, why can't I place an order for now? Feels like someone is taking the piss."}
{"text":"Should it really take 2 hours for a delivery order on a Sunday evening?? We put in the order on our cell application at 6:30 upon getting home from a lake excursion- that made delivery appealing. Well, we've been waiting every since- we have watched the application make No Progress on our order so we've called several times with the assurance that our order was On The Way....we're getting hangry and turning into Betty Whites here... Pizza Arrived 8:47-let's hope it's worth 2 hours of anticipation!!"}
{"text":"We typically order from another pizza place in Laveen but decided to give Dominos a try.  I placed my order online around 530pm. Their website is quite easy to use. About an hour later our food still had not arrived so I called the location, which is slightly over 2 miles from us. I was told by the individual on the phone the delivery guy must have gotten lost and my order was sitting on the heat pad and she would have another delivery driver bring it. She also said around 10 minutes. Another 35 minutes passed and still no food. I called the location several times but they were not answering the phone. Our food finally arrived about 8 minutes later. I asked the driver what took so long and he just said sorry. The food was cold so I called the location, they answered after about 5 rings. I told her My food was cold and she offered me credit for our next order. Really? Why would I want to order again? I asked for a refund, which she had to get approved by the manager. I was told the manager approved the refund.  That's what we get for trying.."}
{"text":"So got what I thought I ordered. Did it online but did not get what I ordered. My bad for not double checking but have ordered online before with no problem. The people are always awesome but food is never hot when delivered. I know if I want it steaming I can go pick it up."}
{"text":"I get my pizza from this location more frequently than I'd like to admit , but the delivery staff are exceptionally accommodating , the pizza is really well made and the rewards system is just a bonus! I love Domino's :)"}
{"text":"I ordered online which was fast and easy.  Before I knew it the order was at my door piping hot!  The driver was super polite and even funny.  I soon discovered that my order was incorrect. I called Adam to let him know. I didn't expect anything but an apology, and just wanted to let him know in case he could prevent someone else from also getting the wrong order. Adam went above and beyond and sent over the correct order!  That is beyond customer service!   Thank you, Adam!!"}
{"text":"Usually order once a week from this dominos out of laziness and it's usually pretty good (despite the occasional forgotten dipping sauce). Last weeks order was a pizza and two salads, except they forgot the salads and the driver had to come back 45 minutes later. The most recent, they forgot to cut the pizza. It's not a huge deal, I have a pizza cutter, but it's a pizza place... that to me just proves their attention to detail is majorly lacking. Hopefully their lapse of memory doesn't include forgetting to wash their hands!"}
{"text":"We have ordered pick up several times in the last month and each time the service and the food were excellent.  We love the thin and crispy pizza it's a keeper.  Management is excellent when dealing with the customers and everyone that we encountered behind the counter have been super nice and efficient.  We will continue to give this location as much business as possible. Thanks Guys Great Job"}
{"text":"Ordered on EatStreet, had the option to upgrade my Large to a Deep Dish so I did. Got it and it was just a hand tossed, called the store and they said they don't do large deep dish and they are apparently aware of the issue that it allows you to order them yet they do nothing about it and just keep giving people pizzas that are cheaper than the one they ordered and doing nothing to rectify the problem or recompense the customers they are ripping off.Your review helps others learn about great local businesses.  Please don't review this business if you received a freebie for writing this review, or if you're connected in any way to the owner or employees."}
{"text":"This is my third and final time trying this particular dominos. I ordered via their website and one hour and 20 minutes later my food came. It was barely warm and not hot and fresh.   I don't mind it taking a while, but the website said 20-33 minutes. It was almost triple that time. Come on, got kids to feed here.   I called to talk to someone. Kid who answered phone was nice, asked for Manager. Was told they are really busy and can't talk to me and they will put a credit on my account for next time. I asked how much since i just paid $42 for barely warm pizza and he was not really sure.   I'm sure they have so much business they could really care less about taking so long, but kind of sucks to pay that much for pizza and it's not even hot. Driver was super apologetic and nice, was not her fault."}
{"text":"Every time I order from this location the pizza has little to no sauce. I don't really like a lot of sauce but some sauce  would be nice. I've called several time to complain over the last few times I've ordered and nothing ever gets done.   The three stars are for the hot wings( those are always on point.)"}
{"text":"I ordered the create your own pasta with chicken, mushrooms and provolone cheese and it was great! it had plenty of sauce and cheese and I am very pleased."}
{"text":"We ordered like 9 large pizzas - the guy offered us unlimited toppings for $10 each I thought he should offered 3 topping pizza for $7.99  I asked for pinaple on one side of the pizza where as it was all over  Pizzas were okay"}
{"text":"They messed up...but their willlingness to fix it in a timely matter made up for it. Plus the quality of the food was top notch, having worked at a domino's pizza in the past it was perfect."}
{"text":"I know that few people resort to Yelp reviews before ordering pizza, let alone from major chains like Dominos, but after repeated shortcuts I cant help but rant a little.  Every time I order the cheesy bread, instead of being 8 slices of bread ready for dipping, it is uncut and I need to cut it myself. I know this shouldn't be a dealbreaker but seriously, 3 of 3 times uncut? Ridiculous! Also because when you order a large pizza its cut into 8 slices, I once asked for it to be cut into 10 slices instead to help with portioning, but sure enough, still only 8 slices and a completely uncut cheesey bread.  The pizza is is fine in taste and when you order online at least there are no surprises with the price when it shows up, but sometimes its the little things that can turn one away."}
{"text":"Consistently Delicious  There are those times when you just want a quick and easy pizza because there isn't time for dinner.   Domino's, has home made pizza, wings, salad and more place.  I have been going to Domino's for years and have never been disappointed.  Domino's is wallet friendly compared with other  high price pizza joints in the community.  The staff at Domino's is very friendly, pizza is great every time and the restaurant always provides  a clean and welcoming dining experience."}

{"text":"The WORST Dominos in Las Vegas.  Constantly screwing up my order. The real complaint is when you ask them to fix the order. They look at you crossed eyed and then become nasty.  Go somewhere that values your business and makes food properly."}
{"text":"I received an email for a free Artisan pizza so I had to try it out. Generally I used to hate Domino's pizza so hard because of the overwhelming salty taste. I came to figure that their pizza is actually alright if you stick with vegetables and cheeses. If you must get meat, make sure it's with some veggies or don't get pepperoni by itself so it's not that bad.   I redeemed my coupon and opted for the Spinach & Feta. It only takes 10-15 mins to be ready for pickup. This \"artisan\" pizza dough is oval shaped and still the same recipe as handtossed. It doesnt come with garlic butter brushed on the crust. So this whole artisan thing is just a phony marketing gimmick. The flavor was actually very good. This was the first pizza I actually LIKE and i am WILLING to order it again in the future and pay the full $7.99 for it.  Feta cheese was always my favorite cheese since ever so that's probably one reason I really enjoy the taste. As for the size I would say thay it is smaller than a large but bigger than a medium. It was also way uglier and uneven, leaving some parts mushy or extremely crispy but somehow it was still pleasant. With the extra cheeses on this pizza (I think it has 3 total- mozz, feta, parmesan) it's more filling than most, if not all their pizzas. They are quite skimpy with their cheeses, so I dont think ordering extra chees does anything at all  I bumped my review to 4 stars because I can finally enjoy my pizza and now I don't have to keep wishing that they were a Papa Johns instead. I share the same block with this location so it's a big deal to me to actually enjoy something from DOMINOS for once. I still hate the other 95% of their entire menu though."}
{"text":"Pizza took 1 hour and 20 min and was cold when it got here.  Never ordering delivery again!!"}
{"text":"Ordered a pan pizza with extra cheese, peperoni and sauce , got a pizza that had 3 slices with nothing on them , looked like someone had beaten it with their fist . 3 pieces had no pepperoni  .  2 had cheese and pepperoni very little sauce . , Pizza was made by Elvis . Dominos must be very proud to have somebody like that who doesn't give a crap about his work . I think in the 50 years pf my eating pizza this was the worst I have ever seen . AND IT WAS COLD . Times square across the street has a fantastic pizza you can pick up for $13.00 . If your going to get  delivery go some where else, Pizza Hut sucks but at least they don't abuse the pizza .ROTTEN Terrible place. Rip=off , putrid"}
{"text":"HORRIBLE customer service from the associate and worse the manager. They charged me for my order that I ordered from the Dominoes mobile app and the store (we always order from via the mobile app) claimed they didn't get the order. I ordered one pasta bread bowel for my daughter. I reviewed my online baking and it clearly says the charge went through for Dominoes. They told me to wait ONE WEEK for the money to return to my bank and the manager would not do anything about it except tell me their Dominoes store has nothing to do with the Dominoes Mobile app. I told her regardless of who is carrying the Dominoes logo SHE is the face of Dominoes regardless if it's the store, the mobile app or Dominoes IT tech. I will never order from Dominoes again! The only reason why I gave it one star is because I had to choose at least one to write the review. I work in customer service and I know what customer care is. This store does not care about their customers nor their franchise reputation."}
{"text":"This place is horrible don't trust the delivery service or the personnel working there.People need to know."}
{"text":"Horrible they don't take bills over 20.00 and the total way 24.00 ... Wtf bullshit terrible service"}
{"text":"On this date while out of town I placed a order to a local hotel with an additional side of marinara ordered (an extra charge). As the delivery driver arrived I asked if the sauce was in the box which he quickly affirmed. I trusted this affirmation to the dismay of no sauce being present. I called the establishment requesting it be taken off my bill, the individual over the phone verbalized that unfortunately that was not an option with the only option being 2 free sauces next time I ordered from this specific location. I explained I was from out of town with no additional solution given. Not placing blame on the individual on the phone as he may not have the ability to do more, but an error such as this should be met with either comp'ing the order or a better solution to rectify this error from a customer service experience. I payed for something I did not receive and my experience was not what I intended it to be despite paying extra to get the respective experience. Next time I vote with my money I will surely vote for better quality, better pizza...and sauce reliably in every box regardless of paying extra for it."}
{"text":"Absolutely horrible service!! These people have no quality service skills what so ever!! Bart made my order and Zoey delivered... first, I tried calling to order over the phone and it kept ringing for 6 minutes! So I hung up and thought I'd try again. Second call I waited ANOTHER 5+ minutes. So nearly 15 minutes just for someone to pick up the phone, (they could've at least picked up and asked if I could hold) So then I ordered online and it said delivery time was 25-35 minutes... try an 1hr and 10 minutes... so I called a 3rd time to cancel and was waiting yet, AGAIN for 7 minutes for someone to answer and I told them forget about it, I'm not even hungry at this point. Then Zoey shows up to my house 5 minutes later and I told her I cancelled and she said okay and didn't even bother to apologize or try to satisfy my complaint. Like are you kidding me?! I just submitted a $28 order and would have gave $35 including tip and that's the service I receive? Haha never again! This place is an absolute joke and an embarrassment to Dominoes."}
{"text":"Disappointment towards the owner.   Made an order at 1130pm (30 minutes before closing) and mind you, the store is 5 minutes drive away.   The delivery took 55 minutes to arrive at my house, and before the delivery arrived, there was an email confirmation telling me to \"enjoy my pizza\".   I asked the delivery guy what the policy was and he said its 45 minutes-50 minutes but when I placed the order, the time was 15-20 minutes.   All the manager can say is \"I can take off delivery charge\". Ridiculous.   The pizza: - very soggy and the toppings slid off as I pulled out the slices. I had to pull out and use my own pizza cutter to get slices. Unacceptable.  - the crust was supposed to be stuffed with cheese.. The receipt said EXTRA CHEESE; if you can't make it according to the franchise recipe, WHY BOTHER??   The cinnamon sticks: Where do you see sticks in this picture? More like cinnamon pita. It was not cut at all.   Overall:  If you don't have the time to make the pizza properly and not have time to cut the slices and sticks, WHY DO YOU TAKE THE ORDER?   This is a new store, so customer service should be good at least so you get customers to come back.   The two cans of Coke were cold and tasted like what they were supposed to though! :P  0.5 stars for this"}
{"text":"will never order from here again. They screwed up my order and were supposed to re-send it out to me. I called them 3 different times to see where my food was and each time they claimed it was on its way. It's now been 3 hours and I still have not received my replacement order. Won't be back."}
{"text":"Normally delivery guys/ girls are awesome! The one I recently had was very rude! Will not be asking for their delivery service for a while."}
{"text":"I always use the online ordering feature and since we have been patronizing this location Store #7456 we have had nothing but great product and good customer service. Been ordering from here for the last two years it has turned our opinion of Dominos as a whole for the better. Quality and fast service rate it high in our book."}
{"text":"Fast friendly service and my pizza was amazing. Dominoes is defiantly doing the pizza game correctly."}

{"text":"Great customer service when ever I carry out from this location! Pizza tasted great and was to my order. Small but clean pick up area. Will be back!"}
{"text":"Robert the pizza driver is amazing dude !!!! He was just in time he took a bomb selfie with us he  was so amazing and sweet and delivered our pizza on time and it was all hot and bomb thanks too him ! You go Robert ."}
{"text":"I understand how an old man can screw up orders but please take him off the phones and have him do something else. Placed an order early on and have had lots of difficulties. Giving Dominos 3 stars because the comped the food which is honorable so I can't give them a bad rating. They need to get some better hire."}
{"text":"I ordered at 12:40 pm and the online order tracker said it was delivered at 1:15 pm but it did not get delivered at that time.   I called the store thinking they gave it to the wrong house or something.   The woman was rude on the phone, huffed, and said \"He just left with your pizza\".   The store is 5-7 mins away tops.   It did not get here until just now ( 2:15 pm ) !!   That's nearly an hour late !   My pizzas were both cold, the driver did not apologize for being late and he didn't have my pizzas in a thermal bag (pizza bag) either.  No wonder they were cold.    I am truly disappointed and will NOT be ordering from this store ever again!!!   They truly do not care about their customer service at all."}
{"text":"I think most people know what to expect from Domino's. You either like it or you don't. Personally I love them so much I used to be assistant manager at a store and ate next to nothing else for almost a year, so as far as my opinion is concerned the food is great.  This store in particular is right near where I used to live and I have to say they're impeccable. Out of probably 30 or more times I ordered they were only late ONCE an it was with very good reason, never messed up an order, and always did right by me."}
{"text":"I don't review pizza places usually because they all serve the same stuff, however, I have to make an exception. I don't walk in but I order online. Every time my order is completed with their web app showing the process, I'm usually sitting waiting for the pizza which is just great! One experience I had delivering pizza to my workplace at about 12AM in the morning was really great because the deliveryman was very considerate and even offered to help me with some of the pizzas because I ordered about 5 of them. Needless to say, the pizzas were well prepared, and their selfless customer service was a very nice added touch. Will definitely step in store to order if I do get the chance to!  09/10/16 (Oct 09 Update) So a few days ago, my friend and I walked in around 9PM and decided to order a pizza or two, and the person at cash register was very kind. Despite the fact that the store was very busy with their online orders, our order didn't seem to take very long despite the fact that the pizzas are made to order. We got all of our stuff within 15 to 20 minutes which was well worth the wait and if you've ever ordered online, that quality check thing you see when you're completing your order? Yep, that is actually a thing! The employees at this location truly do care about your pizza being exactly what you want it to be and do not want to waste your time with something you did not order! Way to go everyone, way to go!"}
{"text":"I ordered my pizza at 7.50pm and I left the house to go into the Harris Teeter to buy a few things as I wait. When I was almost done, at 8.20pm I called the store to check if my pizza was ready. The girl who picked up the phone had a bad attitude. She was unpleasant for no reason at all!!! I did not know they were backed up because the tracker doesn't tell you they are backed up, or approximately how much longer. Her attitude caught me off guard, because the 3 or 4 times I have ordered from this store, I have had no issues at all. I called back to speak to someone who was supposedly the manager, and they did not even try to make the situation right. No apology for my experience, nothing!!! They definitely just lost a customer."}
{"text":"If I could zero stars, I would.  They do not rotate their products. They sell expired soda and have open sodas just sitting in their cooler. The pizza pans are not kept clean, resulting in flies being attracted to them. A few pans fell down, and literally 20 flies flew out. They will touch cash and coins, not wash their hands and start making pizza, without gloves. They have terrible customer service. They have hairs in their cornmeal that is used to make the pizza crust. If they mess up on the pizza, they will use cheese to cover up the part they messed up on. Do yourself a good favor, and go to Barro's or Papa Johns!"}
{"text":"Ordered online on my phone in store. 50% off pizza. They ran out of gluten free pizza & laughed in my face. That's not funny! You should apologize & cancel my order like I wanted.    Jokes on me?  Nope. Called the district manager Cali & he gave us a $15 credit under our number. Went to a different location instead, Forte Apache & Tropicana.   You're a high volume store, how do you run out of GF crust? Lol okay,  crap happens but don't make me feel like garbage because you dislike your job."}
{"text":"$7.49 for a thin crust pizza you can't beat that with a stick. We actually grabbed quite a bit last night using theist online coupons."}
{"text":"Don't bother ordering. Your order will be screwed up every time. Do yourself a favor, punch yourself in the face and save 20 bucks. It is the exact same experience for free."}
{"text":"I tried to order a pizza a few nights ago. About 10 minutes after, my tracker stopped working and I tried calling the store to check on my order and nobody answered. My pizza never showed up. Tonight I tried to order again. Guess what.... the exact. same. thing. I won't be ordering from this store again."}
{"text":"Ive ordered from this store before and it wasnt that bad but this time was ridiculous. It took an hour and a half to get a medium 2 topping pizza and a small gluten free pizza. When it finally got here it was cold!! :( I watched the little tracker thing on my computer and according to it, it took 20 mins to \"prep\" only 8 minutes in the oven and 30 mins to \"quality check\" and the rest of the time to finally get to my door which means it was out of the oven longer than it was in there, how do they expect a pizza to stay hot?!. In the end, it was cold and not very good."}
{"text":"I don't know if the delivery guy grabbed the pizza from under his seat by mistake, but my pizza was old, dry, crunchy, falling apart, assemble-yourself catastrophe.  Needless to say a complaint to corporate is on its way, as Dominos needs to make this right.  Disrespectful to order a pizza and receive this."}
{"text":"Here's the thing.. As simple as this sounds I probably would never come back to this place or dominoes in general because one places start to nickel and dime their customers that means that there's a reason for that... So I ordered my pizza and pasta online for the carry out option and when I arrived after the time it stated wasn't even done that was strike one.. And then on top of the pizza and pasta being late i asked for the crushed red peppers and Parmesan cheese like most people do I was told on there will be an additional charge for that.. excuse me?? Seriously! Yeah not no much I'll continue to go to the other competitors and get my pizza cravings satisfied without having to be nickeled and dime'd for something that is generally complimentary upon ordering that specific dish! But then again I'm sure the excuse they will use is something about the overhead or whatever BS companies use to have different tactics to get more money.. Hmmph that's why they have that now hiring sign on the building for the last 2 months.."}
{"text":"When your options are limited due to the time of day you are hungry, you result to settling for places like Domino's Pizza! After a long night of partying and gambling I ended up here! No phone order just a walk in! The special they were running was $7.99 for any Large 3 topping pizza! The kid who took our order looked super young but he seemed confused. Maybe he was new. Either way he tried and at least got the order right. When we opened the pizza it looked fine i guess but it wasn't until we got to the hotel that we noticed some of the toppings slid right off lol. Ugh how much damn sauce did ya'll put on here? Anyways I really didn't care, for the people who drink you know that when you are hungry and needed that spot to be filled and soak up all the alcohol you can care less about the minor details as such. Would I go back to this location maybe not. Also if you are looking for a job you should apply because they advertise the HELL out of the opportunity here!"}
{"text":"The people who make the pizza at this location eather don't know how to read or flat out don't care what you ordered. I ordered a large pizza with double pepperoni and extra cheese. What I received was light pepperoni, light sause and enough cheese to scare a person from Wisconsin. Not to mention air bubbles the size of baseball's. Sence the people that make your pizza (Tyler) refuse to make the orders as requested and paid for by the customer I would avoid this location at all costs."}
{"text":"I actually called the morning after My order, to tell the management , I would Pay them $20.00 to Never Delivery to my house again. Food took 1 1/2 hours to get 2 miles. Cold, greasy and completely rude telephone service. The only good thing was how cheerful the delivery driver was. Sad, just sad. People expect and deserve better."}
{"text":"The best domino I've ever had. Their pizza is cheesy and saucy. The delivery is really fast."}
{"text":"I don't usually like domino's, found it cheap and not satisfying whatsoever, but when wd moved to our new place, we ordered from here for the moving crew for lunch. All 3 of them as well as me and my wife and my mother were beyond impressed with the quality and promptness of delivery. Since moving in, we have ordered pizza twice,  and it's been from this specific location both times.   This place is fantastic."}
{"text":"Appalled  and disappointed with their customer service.. worst pizza we have ever had !! Not only did they get our order wrong, but the pizza's arrived soaked  in grease, through the box. We called and requested new pizzas. when the delivery driver arrived, the grease was already soaking through the box and dripping down my boyfriend's shirt !  Worst part was dealing with the \"manager\" Colin . It was like talking to a 5 year old ....He argued back and forth with me and he  even went as far to say \" I already made you 2 new pizzas, Im not making you any more\"! We didn't ask for more pizza... We asked for our money back, sad we can't get the 2 hours back we lost tonight dealing with them and waiting to eat. The manager \"Colin\"  was immature and actually made us more upset then the disgusting 4 pizzas we were left with. Such a shame to throw away all that food ! We have ordered from different Dominoes locations, the Sun Prairie store is by far the worst !! Don't waste your money"}
{"text":"I love Dominos pizza and the majority of the time, they make their pizza. This one near my house is located on the Southwest Corner of Brimley and Steeles in the plaza there. I ordered online their special with the 4 topping large pizza and cheesy bread with marinara sauce. It came up to about $22.00 or so after taxes and delivery fees. When you order online, there is a tracker that tells you where your order is at. Order came quickly and the food was nice hot when it arrived at my house. The pizza tasted good and the cheesy bread was delicious. Service was good and the pizza was delivered in a timely manner. Overall, a good convenient location to get your pizza fix!"}
{"text":"I love this location, their deliveries are always super quick and the staff is very friendly and helpful. They have some great specials and the pizzas are great. I'm not sure what happened with these previous 2 reviews, but you get what you order. I've never had anything bad from here and I order all the time!  If you're looking for good pizza, fast, this is your place. Pizza Hut takes FOREVER to deliver, and the local Papa Johns makes poor quality pizza."}
{"text":"Can I possibly be the first to review this fine establishment?  Inconceivable!  I've ordered from this location a few times-only carry-out I believe.  As far as Domino's goes, this one seems to be reliable in a pinch.  Pizza has been consistently hot, not soggy, and not disgusting.  On-line ordering is convenient and there's always a special.  I should warn you the carry-out experience will not always go smoothly.  Last time I picked up, this was the conversation:  Me:  Hi, I'm here to pick up an order. Domino's Associate (DA):  Have you ordered yet? Me:  Uh, yes. DA:  Have you paid? Me:  Yes (while thinking \"shouldn't you know.\") DA:  Okay, here's your pizza.  Thank you. Me:  I ordered drinks. DA:  Oh yeah, a Coke and a Coke Zero, Coke-Coke Zero, Coke-Coke Zero, Coke-Coke Zero.......repeats as he trails off to the cooler. DA:  Here you go...hands me a Sprite and a Diet Coke.  I shall spare you the rest.  I was comforted to see a few older employees working there.  Somehow I have convinced myself there is less of a chance of the cheese on my pizza having been up someone's nose."}
{"text":"Even in your most wild dreams of possible turnarounds, DO NOT THINK this place will deliver in a reasonable time with hot (or warm) food. Hear me: DO NOT ORDER FROM HERE... Oh you did? Let me guess... You wull fret and call and check the fake tracker and then you dinally call and rhey say its on the way and the 40 more minutes pass and  then you call and will try and cancel and they will LIE and tell you the driver is right outside and you have to pay... DON'T. Get your refund and NEVER ORDER FROM HERE AGAIN. TRUST. DON'T. Oy."}
{"text":"It's in the Brooklin neighbourhood and open till late. I have downloaded the app and able to order 15 minutes before (mostly reorder) and pick up my order, till now I did not have to wait to pickup my order. Fresh and Yammy!!"}
{"text":"I'm pretty irritated that my 2 pizzas, quoted at 19-29 minutes just took 1hr 8 minutes to get here. Completely unacceptable. I'm shocked it was even warm at all. Though the cheese was no longer melty. And James was hardly apologetic. I'll order from Val Vista next time."}
{"text":"They are consistently inconsistent! Pan pizza is often all white and mushy, but sometimes crispy, almost over cooked! I thought they were on a conveyer belt? Brooklyn style which I used to like is all salty and garlic tasting and under cooked. I only order here cause I work late and their delivery is fast, but the food is below normal standards from competitors. Wings are slimy, small, not hot, kinda gross. I'm not eating here anymore"}
{"text":"Omg I order a lot of pizzas, but tonight was by far the best one in ah long while. Toppings were spot on, piping hot, speedy delivery, an pleasant service... Thanks Dominos"}
{"text":"I dont bother with the Pizza. I had it a few times and it was never good. Lucky for me I never purchased one. I only stick to the other items they sell."}
{"text":"My review is based on having domino's numerous times throughout my life at locations here in the US and the UK. I had my pizzas delivered, it only took 20 minutes from me ordering to receiving the pizza which is very quick. It probably was slower being a Sunday but I am still impressed.   My only grip is that I feel like there was less than a normal amount of sauce that I am used to. Now I did not order the normal sauce, I had two pizzas, one with alfredo sauce and another with BBQ sauce (two mediums two-toppings for $15), they just seem quite dry. Maybe next time I will order extra sauce."}
{"text":"So far, only ordered late night using their awesome app!!! Orders have been correct everytime I pickup. One time they made a fresh pie for me before I arrived instead of trying to pass off the wrong one to me. Honesty and customer service goes a long way with me."}
{"text":"For cheap pizza Domino's is alright in my book. Both this location and the one on Northern and 51st are my go to locations, but for flavor this location on Glendale and 35th still comes out ahead. Maybe the ovens are more seasoned or something. So far, my experiences here have been above board and the biiiiiig plus is you can do carry-out without leaving the comfort of your own car. Bonus!!!"}
{"text":"Haven't had Dominos in years. This was a very good experience they changed their store and the pizza tastes was better than I remember it. I would definitely order from here again."}
{"text":"Still horrible, missed my order completely wasting my time for 2+ hours. Any other dominoes is better. Ahmed is a complete retard calling himself a manager."}
{"text":"Took over n hour to get cold pizza.. the guy answering the phone is about as smart as my dog.."}
{"text":"I always get my pan pizza right from this location. Their service can be improved and speeded up. One thing that really annoys me about this location is for the past two years i have been coming here and every time i get a drink with my pizza its always warm. Its never cold enough. They have a problem with their fridge and been ignoring it for the past two years."}
{"text":"WORST experience of my life at this dominos.  I ordered from here for months with no issues until today. I ordered my coworkers lunch online, it was Parmesan bread bites & lava cakes. I had it delivered to our work office which was 2 miles away. I specifically asked the delivery driver to CALL ME when she arrived. (So I could quietly leave my office & go outside to grab the food without a hassle.)   I was called 10 minutes after placing my order & told that my driver couldn't call me when she arrived. So I asked for a different driver. I was told she was the only driver.    Not only did she not call me when she arrived, she dropped my food at the receptionist desk, asked the receptionist to forge my signature and LEFT THE PROPERTY before I could even get my food. The receptionist at my work had to call me to pick up the food from our front office & when I did, the lava cakes were UNCOOKED & still in the aluminum containers. It was so clear that the whole order was thrown together in a matter of seconds. My coworker was so disgusted with the service & quality of food that she called to complain to the manager & got all the food refunded. What kind of delivery driver dumps your food at the front desk, doesn't get the customers signature when you paid via credit card & leaves so quickly??! It's because she knew the food was horrible quality & didn't want to meet me face to face because I was already frustrated that she refused to call me when she arrived. I will NEVER return to this location."}
{"text":"Wow! I've never experienced this kind of service with a chain pizza restaurant before. Domino's is very friendly over the phone when they take your order. It's the kind of service you would expect to receive from everyone. They are quick (usually 35 minutes) and the pizza is always hot (and yummy) when I receive it.  They've always gotten my order right (which is a big plus), I hate sending people back for ranch.   I don't order Domino's often, but when I do it's a pleasant experience.  Way to go Domino's!!"}
{"text":"The pizza was flat, almost no sauce, doe was hard and just not good. Even the kids (that like any pizza), did not like it and only took a few bites.  Maybe it's just this location, since I have ordered in Miami with satisfaction. I will just stick to Pizza Hut when in town and recommend the same."}
{"text":"This is the worst experience ever I ever had at this dominos and at any place ever. We stood there for more than 5 minutes masking the workers if we can order. They just looked up and back down. A lady came from the back look at us asking to order and then went back. We stood there mute. Didn't say anything. People should be trained better even if there not taking orders. Bad service. Definitely will not see us return at all what so ever. I will also recommend all of my friends and everyone to not come here also."}
{"text":"So the other night me and my girl both tired from a long day saw the commercial for Domino's not just pizza any more and decided to give it a try.  Everything was pretty good. We ordered a sandwich some wings and a desert and a drink. The food was on time, the order tracker is cool it lets you know who is working on your food and the time it is taking to get it to you...the order was hot and the order was accurate and on time.  The only thing I didn't like was the price, It cost almost $50 for the two of us. Seems pretty expensive considering we didn't even order any pizza. cant say I will be ordering again from them, for that amount of money we could go have sushi.   But if you want the convenience there ya go."}
{"text":"When the time finally came for the manager to pick up the phone, he told me that they were understaffed, with too few drivers for the demand tonight. I understand this situation, being a former food service employee. If you are the manager and are reading this: please reach out to your customers if you think their order is not going to leave the store. Some of us have transportation and can pick up our food. But I'm not going to pick up a pizza that sat in a warming oven for 2 hours. That extra star is for the cooks and drivers. I would've given a favorable review had the manager of a business done what a manager should do.   So yeah, I share an experience very similar to other reviewers. Placed an order at 9:05PM on a Saturday on their website for 1 medium, 1 large, and 1 order of cheese bread. Very excited for the cheese bread. They estimated 97 min to 107 min, which I can accept for a Saturday night. However, it's been not 107 min, but 160 min. I called when the clock hit that first number, and stayed on hold for 47 minutes. Yes, 47 minutes on hold listing to an ad for pizza that I really didn't feel confident I would ever receive. (Of course, I'm not some crazy person who would sit on hold for 47 minutes for pizza and not get some work done online, like write this review).   You can't waste people's time like this."}
{"text":"Literally took 25minutes to make my order and receive it by delivery plus a complimentary 2 liter drink! So fast and delicious!"}
{"text":"Thank God this Dominos saved Our Lives after waiting nearly two hours for Pizza Hut to deliver Domino's was so fast and delicious I don't even think we waited 20 minutes thanks Dominos!"}
{"text":"I had a wonderful experience at Dominos pizza, thanks to  Taylen, my experience started with her, answering the phone with  a clear articulate voice, so tired of people saying what, just because they need another second to process my question, then Taylen made the best domino pizza I ever had, keep up the good work,then she closed the deal, with a big smile and made sure I had  everything I needed everything,"}
{"text":"We have all done things we aren't proud of...even Rex Marvin. Sure, I threw a blind old lady down a flight of stairs for touching my foot with her cane. I have gone into hospitals and eaten people's food while they are asleep, took the flowers and used their toilet and not flushed. I have chased little kids off my lawn with a hacksaw and a freshly cut pigs head. I have thrown snowballs that I have soaked in waters and put in my freezer until they were harder than rocks at Girl Scouts just so they would drop their boxes of cookies. I have dreamed of Kenny G naked.  I have done ALL of these things AND some things that I am not proud of.   I will share one shameful secret with you now. For years, when the tin can collection business was bad, and when the Cabbage Patch sex doll modification industry bottomed out...I was forced...to eat Domino's pizza.  I know! I know. I am a monster. I hate myself. I really do. It is like the time I slept with Melissa Rivers, there is no excuse. There is no water that can clean my body, no booze that can erase my memories, no religion that can fix my broken soul.  Melissa and Dominos...two of the most horrible things anyone can put in their mouth.   For months I have seen the commercials that Dominos have changed. Apparently the old chef's formula of tire rubber, used diapers, cheese made in the Ukraine and some kind of red liquid type substance was no longer suitable to the American palate.  News flash...it never was! It was cheap. It was easy to get and 9 out of 10 times conveniently placed near a hospital, insane asylum, refugee camp, old man bar or a factory whose chemicals were so strong that it removes 2 or more senses from its long term employees.  The weak, the drunk, the drug addled, the infirmed, the crazy, the stupid and the people who didn't know any better were the Domino's typical crowd. The lobby of a Domino's rivaled the DMV for the scariest place on earth.  Well...dear readers...I know you love me. I know you worship me. I know that I am your God. You know I hate you all, but you don't care. That makes me hate you more. Well, your love of me after this admission will complete the process from abject hatred to indifference.  I tried it again. I did. The commercials got me. I had to know this hot crap could be any better?  Well, you know what...it is. It is MUCH better.  I want to preference this part of my review by saying that all chain pizza places suck and they should not be considered to be real pizza by anyone who doesn't live in Idaho, because they are rubes who know no better. So my stars are based only on chain pizza places and not real food.  So, I tried the new and improved red sauce pizza and it is good for what it is...a step above frozen pizza, and 10 steps below real pizza.  I didn't think it was the greatest thing since sliced bread, I didn't think it was as good as good plain bread. It was a pretty decent chain pizza.  Well, after that...and this accounts for one star...I had a revelation...they serve white sauce and BBQ sauce.  The BBQ sauce was okay, take it or leave it...but the white pizza was so damn good it made my knees shake.  This was actually a good pizza.  Here is why. The white sauce was good, I added chicken and bacon for my toppings...immediately I am giving Dominos every chance to be good. How can you screw this up...well they didn't and they did something wonderful. The butter cheese spread they put on the crust that really is a decent addition with the red sauce, and useless with the BBQ, was now a true delight. This pizza was rich, buttery, cheesy, and delicious.  It cost me 6 bucks, and for 6 bucks I will get it again...and not just when I am high as a kite off of dust cleaner fumes...oh no...it is good enough to eat sober...and lets face it...whoever thought they would say that about Dominos?  Rex doesn't hate you. Rex hates everyone."}
{"text":"maybe it's silly to review domino's but i've gotta give credit where credit is due.    when we order from here, it's always accurate, piping hot, and fast.  what more can you ask for?    even the \"kids\" that work there are kind, void of cynicism, and genuinely eager to help.  management/ownership:  whatever you're doing--keep it up!"}
{"text":"We ordered Half and half extravaganza-meatza w/ alfredo sauce instead for delivery. Waited 45mins for it but it came wrong. Called the store again to have it replaced and promised us for another 45 mins but 1hour passed already so We called again to follow up and said the remake has not yet been made so we waited for another 15mins. Such an disappointing, poor management and customer service."}
{"text":"I wish zero or negative stars was an option here. They took my order over the phone for pickup. I did not get what i ordered when I arrived. Instead they argued with me and denied any wrong doing and said I did not order what I had claimed. I would never come back here, mainly because i ended up walking away and paying for something i did not want. Pizza tasted lousy as expected from a joint like this one. Tons of pizza alternatives in mississauga, dont waste your time on this one!"}
{"text":"Probably the worst pizza I have ever eaten. Something was wrong with the Italian sausage, both types, and the tomato sauce was overpowering. I will never order from here again. (I worked for a Domino's franchise in Bakersfield, CA. years ago and we made a hell of a lot better pizza.)"}
{"text":"Dominos is dominos. But when I walk in and order and watch my pizza be ready for 40mins. I had to stand up and ask them to look at the name on the box an hour after I ordered. This dominos is slow. Drive 5 miles out of your way if you want it. Edit: our soda was flat. Seriously go get Ian's or drive out of your way for dominos don't go to this one"}
{"text":"I absolutely love their sandwiches here! Delivery is pretty fast, which is always a plus. Drivers are always really kind, I've never had a bad experience here!"}
{"text":"Just moved into the West View area and decided to give old faithful Domino's a try. Like others have stated, don't even bother trying to order from this one. We placed an order online and an hour later it was still at the \"quality check\" stage. So I decided to call to just check up on it.....10 minutes later on hold, no answer at all. We live close enough, so we decided to go and see what the hold up was. Remember this was now an hour and roughly 15 minutes after I ordered. We walk in and give our order number and ask what's going on. The guy tells me that it's \"just in the oven now\" and that it will be done in 7 minutes. I politely asked for a refund, which was obliged, by a lame apology. Needless to say, I won't be going to Domino's at all around here unless I find another location not too far away."}
{"text":"Would have given no stars if possible. Witnessed a driver from this location commit a hit and run on an Asian students car in the parking lot to my business. The general manager showed up before the driver even got back and tried to stick up for the lying driver. I've never seen more ignorance in a human being. They really tried to lie and ruin this mans night and car without making it right. And for the manager to try and stick up for the driver that way is ridiculous when I obviously watched it happen. Had to get police involved for proper handling of the situation. Manager and driver should be fired, I cannot believe what I witnessed tonight. If you get a driver in a Silver Monte Carlo, watch your property for the love of all things decent in life."}
{"text":"Payed for double mushrooms and got a lot less than double. I wouldn't mind if I didn't pay extra but since we love mushroom pizza we opt to pay more..disappointed."}
{"text":"DO THEY ANSWER THE PHONE?! OMG I WAS ON HOLD FOREVER... Online kept telling me they dont deliver to Apache/Mc Clintock but they have before. Annoying.."}
{"text":"Excellent! I was excited to hear they deliver to the Rainbow Valley area! We tried them out tonite and it was great! We had Pizza, pasta bread bowl and a sub - all were still very hot when they arrived! I even like how the Dominoes app gives you step by step updates on your order :)  I will order again!"}
{"text":"I always get my pizza within 20-30 mins after ordering! Pizza is always hot, good and you can't beat the price when ordering the $5.99 coupon deal!"}
{"text":"It's really unfortunate that my family is done with Domino's because of this location. Every single time we order something is missing,  wrong, burnt, cold etc. Tonight we ordered two sandwiches and an order of wings. One sandwich was not what was ordered, the other was ordered with extra chicken and there was literally one slice of chicken across the entire sandwich. The wings were scraps and one of them was even the peice of the wing that is supposed to be cut off and not served. You can complain, but no one here wants free food. We want our food delivered right the FIRST time.  It's clear that management at this location does not care about the quality or accuracy of their orders."}
{"text":"Garbage...With all the R&D you'd think they would have some decent pizza and hoagie...I was looking for a late night snack. Don't order from here.  Rude and food is made with zero pride.   Most of all, the pepperoni tasted rotten.  Regurgitated it. Get yourself together Dominos.  You should be ashamed of yourself as a national chain. Wtf.  Done with you. Literally barfed three times due to food poisoning directly related to your 'fresh' pepperoni."}
{"text":"Ordered a thin crust pizza from here last night.  Was hands down, one of the worst pizzas I have ever had.  It tasted like cardboard.  Was delivered before expected delivery time, but wasn't even close to warm.  Did I mention it tasted like cardboard?  Very disappointing."}
{"text":"Never again.   I ordered online today from this location. First of all, my order took well over an hour and 15 minutes to get to me. It had been so long I called the store to make sure I actually had an order coming.   Once it did arrive, the driver had forgotten my 2 liter of soda. This is the 4th delivery from this location that's happened with! I called again to complain and the person on the phone was less than helpful. He blamed it on a new driver and said he can't control the speed. Fair enough. Not your fault. But when I complained that I can never seem to get my entire order from this Dominoes, I wasn't offered any apologies or even for the cost of my soda deducted from my order.  My driver said he would be back with missing items. I'm still sitting here waiting for my soda, but I doubt the driver will get it here by the time I'm done eating.   If you really want pizza from this store I suggest picking it up yourself."}
{"text":"This place can't seem to get your order right! I'm Never coming here again. I'll just go to Pizza Hut or papa John's for now on."}
{"text":"I have the BEST Domino'sPizza Team in my neighborhood!!  I use their app to place the order and what they deliver ALWAYS tastes great!!!"}
{"text":"I made some soup I tried calling these people at dominos she doesn't even know how to answer a phone nor to take an order nor to know her menu I refused to order from this place disgusting I just made soup"}
{"text":"As far a Domino's locations goes, this seems to be the one that never disappoints.  They're speedy, quality is always great, and our delivery driver always seems to be David and he's great.  I can't quiet decide if stuffed cheesy bread or the online pizza tracker is the greatest invention ever but both are awesome.  I have a Domino's by my house that's nowhere near as good as this location, which is probably why I only order pizza at work!"}
{"text":"Domino's has ruined my night. I got home late, my delivery had just shown up, the number they had on file didn't know there was a pizza coming. I call the store for FIFTEEN MINUTES, at least TEN TIMES-no answer! Finally they answer their phone and then proceed to tell me the driver was too scared to come back to my house, actual words \"he said it was dark and he felt uncomfortable\" then the manager added the store was about to close, so all in all, my pizza cannot be delivered. I understand the manager cannot make his child of a driver deliver my pizza if he claims to be \"uncomfortable\", so I still want my pizza, and decide to go down myself for my now AT LEAST 20 minute late pizza-mmm, yum. Plus, it'll be nice to put a face to this driver who must be 12-yrs-old. I get there, no one is up front when they KNEW I was coming! I literally waited three minutes before the driver noticed a customer up front and all he did was call for the manager and go back to the back. Guess what? He looked to be about 35 years old, what the-I'm really trying not to curse throughout this review, but I am LIVID. The manager comes up, looking like he's now the one scared of me, and by the way, this guy looks to be around 18. Not that he's too young to be a manager but he was obviously lacking confidence and intelligence from the whole scenario I'm having with him. I'm just wondering a few things. Not why they have jobs at all, that would be mean, though the driver really needs to look into a new job if he can't drive to a normal looking neighborhood at night, definitely a poor choice for his career. But I'm also wondering why no one was checking the front more frequently, there was an extremely easily accessible donation jar in my reach the entire time. Someone could easily walk in and walk out. Why my phone calls weren't answered until they were almost closed-actually I was definitely calling longer than 15 minutes. I actually did ask him why they never answered the phone, his response was he was counting the inventory in the walk-in. ARE YOU KIDDING ME!? Your phone is ringing repeatedly during the span of a few minutes, you really aren't going to stop and answer?? Or if you couldn't hear it your employee couldn't tell you the phone was ringing REPEATEDLY!!!!!!??!!?!??!???!?!?!! WHY THE HELL ARE THESE TWO THE ONLY ONES IN THE STORE ON A FRIDAY NIGHT!?!?!?!?? -Honestly, all this was just pasted from my Facebook post. As a follow up, I was able to get a hold of the store's GM this morning to tell him about the FIVE charges I found on my bank account, essentially he solved my problem, refunding the money and also giving my a credit for my next pizza with them, but I was unimpressed by the feel I got from him on the phone.  I really need the DM to be aware that this particular store seems to be falling apart and may need to be checked on.

{"text":"Ugh...pretty much the only way to sum up the pizza i received from this location. Seriously do better."}
{"text":"The pizza I got here was horrible. It was greasy, soggy and gross. I normally go to Rancho but decided to try this one since it qas closer, I will never make that mistake again. Seemed like a bunch of inexperienced kids work here. One should take pride in their work and all pizza should be made with love not loads of grease and crappy bacon."}
{"text":"Horrible customer service. Not ordering here anymore. Employers have an attitude problem."}
{"text":"I have been so happy with this Dominoes. I made an error on my order and they fixed it, didn't charge me and were so great! I am a big fan of this local pizza spot."}
{"text":"DO NOT ORDER FROM HERE. This is by far the worst, most disappointing Domino's in the Las Vegas area.   Let's start with:  FOOD QUALITY: not once but EVERYTIME I order and my food comes in its BURNT, dirty, raw and loaded with hair! This is unacceptable and the food safety board has been notified.  STAFF: From the female manager I spoke to this morning April 1st to the day workers.  Rude, mean, disrespectful and unprofessional.  After sending me dirty food, they blame me as if I'm the one who works there.  OVERALL: this is a dump. If you value your health, money and respect move on to a new location please. Don't deal with what I had to deal with.  Seriously.  I encourage you to call corporate if you've experienced something like I have and let them know. They have already arrange a secret shopper due to this."}
{"text":"After more than 10 years of not eating dominos, i finally tried it again after hearing that dominos had improved their pizza. We ordered a thin crust and it was extremely salty."}
{"text":"Worst experience ever! The manager Michael was an asshole and completely unprofessional. He should be fired for how disrespectful he is. He laughed at me when I complained about the order taking over an hour and a half. Never ordering there again"}
{"text":"I always order pizza from here when we're in the mood for pizza; rarely if ever. I have ordered through theirn online service every time and I've never had a problem. I have gone and picked up the pizza myself and have had it delivered, both times the staff has been nice.   Since I don't like many of the other pizza places around I will continue to order from here.  If no Peter piper pizza delivered."}
{"text":"Great pizza  and cheesy bread. I usually pick up and been done when they say done. some kind talk why getting order but they get to the point quick. Haven't ever had a bad time at this location. bo and maddie are very good at management."}
{"text":"Yes I have to say that this dominos pizza is a tasty breath of fresh air most dominos are average but this one is one of best dominos pizza out there real cheese meat build your own pizza online is one of the best and it tells you how long you have to wait before your pizza is done.Heres a tip sign up for piece of the pie rewards you can earn points once per day for in-store and phone orders of $10 or more after you get up to 60 points you get a free pizza"}
{"text":"They screwed up 2 orders in a row. The first I had 2 Extravaganzas sub. bacon for ham and they gave me 1 and 1 meat lovers or something. The second time I had 1 of the same and they gave me no bacon and ham. Both times they asked me to bring it back to them (it was carryout). Really? The circus is south of here (in Mexico) where you belong.  Sure, they offered to replace it both times but you have to wait for that. Thanks again clowns. Fire the manager, she is a definite clown. I'll give her a red nose for free."}
{"text":"On my last order, they forgot to put the sauce on the pan pizza!  Who does this? I called and left messages for the manager - never called me back. !"}
{"text":"Who ever put the directions on here when you click the maps it doesn't work and directs you totally wrong place"}
{"text":"Delivered half an hour later than quoted. Pizza was cold, the driver not particularly polite, and they didn't bother to include the marinara cups that they charged EXTRA for to go with our stuffed cheesy bread. There was next to no cheese or toppings on the pizza. The stuffed cheesy bread was pretty good, or at least could have been if it had the marinara sauce.   It's the first time I've ordered from Domino's in years, because the Handmade Pan looked good. It looks nothing the ads, which I know to expect.   Still, it would have been nice if they could have gotten right."}
{"text":"So we ordered from Domino's from time to time since it's affordable fast food but we ordered at this particular one twice and it has been such a disappointment. On our first try, a friend used my cellphone to order a pizza. An hour later we were still pizza-less so I called back to make sure. I told the problem to the employee on the phone and he told me that it had only been 15 minutes since we called. I told him that I was calling from a Smartphone and that I had the exact time I hung up right before my eyes and that it was more than an hour ago. The guy insisted that it had only been 15 minutes so I stopped arguing with him seeing as that was going nowhere. On our second try, I called in to get a pizza but most of the possible toppings were missing. It was to the point were the guy had to told us which one he actually had so we could make a selection. To top it of, the deliveryman was missing the receipt so he asked us how much the guy on the phone said that the pizza would cost. I had to refrain from saying \"too much\". We are never ordering from that place again. I'm sure there are other pizzeria's in the area that will be happy to prepare diner for us."}
{"text":"Oh, dear, things are not good at this DOMINOS outlet. I have ordered pizza from this location many times previously and was impressed with the quality. This week the mailman is flogging two flyers from Domino's, with seperate prices for the same things. Weird, eh? I ordered the Extravaganza medium, with a coupon code, which previously was hot, delicious and recognizable for the ingredients. This time, I guess the code is for ground up, pre-digested table scrapings for toppings on a machine made crust. Website and email says call the store if you have customer complaints, no thanx, I want somebody who can fix my problems, cause this pie is a real problem."}
{"text":"I agree, this Domino's Pizza is awesome. They're pretty fast too.  I mostly go for pick up because it's really close.  Their pizza is really good, much better than Pizza Pizza's. I LOVE their cheesy bread too."}
{"text":"Awesome customer service, I was struggling to use a coupon online and I called and hey acknowledged the coupon. Probably the best pizza service I've had."}
{"text":"Great pizza. Service is good. The staff are friendly. Delivery is on time.  I haven't had a bad pizza yet."}
{"text":"I don't know what I the world has happened to domino's pizza quality this past couple of years.....but NO. The delivery is still top notch, but flavor? HA yeah....well....NO. One world can sum up their pizza...SALT.....I don't know what kind of ingredients they use, but if you have high blood pressure, go ahead kiss your kids and parents and tell them you love them.   P.s. The \"salty\" has been going on for a while now. More like 3 separate occasions over a year and a half time span."}
{"text":"Fast and Hot! Love the lunch time special and the online ordering ability."}
{"text":"Me and some coworkers ordered some pizza for our department, we got two large pizzas, one was supposed to be a buffalo chicken pizza and the other just plain cheese with sausage. This had to be the worst pizza i ever had, the sausage pizza had very minimal sauce, some of the sausages were over cooked and burnt on top , and it was dry! The other pizza had no sauce on it! Literally only chicken and cheese that was burnt! No one even attempted to eat that Pizza, closing note on that Pizza was the chicken did not even look like chicken, I'll include a picture of that one to show there was no sauce at all!"}
{"text":"First time here.  Place is very clean, staff if friendly and efficient.  Our pizza was very good, and so was the Cinnimon twists."}
{"text":"I never review any place but this was BS. I walked in ordered my pizza and waited. I saw the screen were you tack the order and my order was up, but I could hear the staff asking where was my pizza. So I just took my seat. After 25 mins one of the staff members told me after I asked about my one large 2 topping pizza...  \"First we have to make it then we have to put it in the oven it should be done soon.\" this answer after 25mins...  Will never go back."}
{"text":"THEY HAVE THE MOST RIDICULOUS PEOPLE WORKING HERE. They arent even worth the 8.25 they make. The driver never comes back EVERY time he forgets my items ordered and has them in the car with him. I called while he was still on my street BUMPING HIS MUSIC and its been 45 mins since. Not to mention this happening EVERY time I order. We all know this location SUCKS. This order was not what I placed they did not care to hear that I wanted a credit as I didnt need the food in 2 hours when they went back out for delivery I mean come on. THANKS BUT NO THANKS KIDS"}
{"text":"First off. Older gentleman came to the counter talking with food in his mouth. Unprofessional. Two: we ordered 4 pepperoni pizzas and went to Albertsons while we waited for them. Picked them up and got home to find out we got four cheese pizzas. I called while my partner drove back to get the right Oder and the girl was confused about what we wanted as a order as if it was really that difficult to understand. No offense. Finally, she ended up just giving us 2 Pepperonis which is far from the four we ordered and paid for. Out of frustration we took the two and left. Smh! So irritating!  Stop eatting while helping customers and actually pay attention to the orders! If I could give less then one star I would!"}
{"text":"I order from this store at least 5-6 times a week. As well as multiple other stores across Las Vegas because of my consistent trips around the valley throughout the week. Their Pizza as well as other edibles they have are always delicious and cooked as well as they advertise, the quality from what I can tell from being a professional pizza eater is second-to-none. I've tried every single big shop in Vegas as well as a few mom and pop shops and Domino's has it right. Excellent service from everybody I've interacted with as well."}
{"text":"Well, they finally changed the address on Yelp.  Up until last week they claimed this was about two miles away, which caused me big problems when I ordered and then drove to pick it up.  I was all ready to give it one star but the address is now correct so I can't really dock them on that.  But what I can dock them on is that they don't give out free red pepper or Parmesan cheese, if you want that they will sell it to you for $1.20.  That is preposterous.  Pizza was pretty good though, and the young lady at the counter was very friendly."}
{"text":"The food was made really good and it got delivered really quick! I will be ordering again for sure :)"}
{"text":"Ugh.  We got some sort of bird wing/feathers...maybe a rat rib cage in our wings today.  Just completely gross.  No response from the company - I doubt they care much.   I'll attach pictures.  Think twice before ordering anything from this establishment."}
{"text":"If I could give negative stars, I would.  I rarely order delivery pizza, and even less from Dominoes.  The last time I ordered from there my pizza was delivered over an hour late and was cold.  That was nearly 6mos ago.  Today I pre-ordered for a specific time.  It came on time but as a cash delivery.  I had ordered with a credit card online.  The delivery man called the store manager and she said it was entered as cash.  Meanwhile, I brought my laptop to the door to show it was entered as credit card, but after hearing the manager speaking about me (he had the speaker phone on) I just shoved the food back to him and said \"forget it, you guys just can't get this right.\"  Perhaps I was rude, but if they want customers they need to up their game.  Had to call my bank to make sure no charges went/go through seeing as how I entered all my info on their website."}
{"text":"Don't know what's up with all the bad reviews but this dominos is great. They are always on time when delivering and the pizza is a billion times better then Pizza Hut. For a quick non fancy pizza I totally recommend Dominos"}
{"text":"me and my friend's go to this pizza place when we want pizza either delivery or carry out. friendly staff, never had a bad pizza, though I duno how high my standards are for pizza, I just know that I hate pizza pizza."}
{"text":"The worst service I have ever experienced from a dominos. After placing my order online and getting a quoted time of 25-35 minutes I was quite pleased but after waiting over an hour I called the store to ask where my pizza was and Adam stated that my order had been made and would be out shortly as they were behind on orders. My order then did not arrive till 45 minutes after my call to the store my order arrived luke warm and with dried out pizza and cold sides. Up to this point dominos has been one of my favorite choices for delivery but I will not use this dominos ever again after such horrible service and quality of food."}
{"text":"I ordered on my dominoes app. I love dominoes since they've made over their pizzas. But the pizza tracker on the app told me my food was ready at 7:34 pm. I get to Dominoes at 7:44 and they tell me my food's going to be another 5 minutes... That sucked, but oh well."}
{"text":"We order frequently. Food is hot and good. Love the easy checkout with coupons online. Thanks."}
{"text":"The owner is rude he refused to deliver me 40 pizzas! So I decided to try them out even after the fact and there pizzas are just terrible! I'm glad I gave them a chance because I'll never buy from them again!"}
{"text":"Ordered from this place a couple of times online a few different days during the week. I like that there is a pizza tracker is online, but that does me no good when you can't count on the actual people to deliver it on time.  After getting home from school one day at 12:30, I figured I'll order some pizza, I needed something quick because I had to be at work at 3. Around 1:30, the pizza had still not arrived, I called, and they said it would be about another 2 hours! Absolutely ridiculous.  This happened a few more times since then. I am never ordering from Dominos again."}
{"text":"Driver was prompt and nice. Store left dip out for the wings. Had to run up to driver before he pulled out to get some. BBQ chicken was overcooked. Could not taste sauce and barely any bacon. Mostly burnt cheese."}
{"text":"This was almost 5 star worthy honestly. The hand tossed pan pizza blows my mind. Great deal I got was a 3 topping hand tossed pan pizza and cheesy bread (so garlicky and buttery, mmm) after tax was under 17$ that's a great deal, seems the pan pizza has a thicker crust which gets all crispy and goldeny cooked by the pan treatment. If u get more toppings I found the cheesy level goes up to compensate almost covering over the edges of crust and getting cooked against the sides of the pan in this harmony of greatness.... After giving this a shot I've not ordered from anywhere else since, its never been a disappointment. Try that pizza specifically , trust me it will be good. DO IT!"}
{"text":"Ordered carry out. When I got home the order was incorrect  called and they offered an account credit. Called to use the credit and of course no record. Offered to give date and time of call as I have the record on my phone but no. Dominos has lost my business because of this store"}
{"text":"I ordered a pizza at 8:55pm on May 31, 2018 At 10:00pm it was still sitting in the store, they said they did not have enough drivers, horrable service, I will never order from them again and I will be calling their corporate office."}
{"text":"My deliverer was fast and nice. This is my go to place when I was some garlic breaded pizza."}
{"text":"Crappy pizza, service wasn't great- had to wait an extra 10 mins and was more expensive than milanos. Won't be going back"}
{"text":"I placed my order online at 12:41pm. The confirmation said 20-30 minutes. At exactly one hour, I called the store and spoke to Jose. I asked if he knew where my order was? He said he would call the driver and call me right back. I waited 10 more minutes and called back. I was put on hold. Once the call was answered, he said he had forgotten because they were so busy and he would have to call the driver and call me back. When I asked to speak to a supervisor, I was told there wasn't one there that shift. He never called me back and I received my food 1 hour and 25 minutes after initial order. My food was cold and nobody ever said so much as sorry. I killed my entire lunch time and know have no time to replace it with something warm and fresh. Absolutely infuriating the way I was treated by this store."}
{"text":"Been going here for a couple of months now and they only had 1 mistake and that was they gave us the wrong pizza.  They fixed it right away and re-made our order.  Fast service and the consistency of the order has been spot on every time.  LOVE these guy's"}
{"text":"When I'm at work and I want pizza I usually go to dominos the staff when you get them on the phone is friendly and offer promotions and let you know upfront if they have any specials unlike other places that don't or fight you over pizza is ALWAYS on point never had a bad pizza delivered or wrong toppings cold etc figured it was time to write a review they have earned it and wanted to show my appreciation for the store as I'm sure given the area they probably don't get much thanks and the quality of food and service is great keep up the good work guys"}
{"text":"I have been here a couple of times its close to work and cheap so my co workers always drag me here. Although I think chain pizza joints are evil because they mess up my favorite food and turn it into a manufactured unloved baby. As oppose to real gem pizza places where its a love baby.    I give customer service 5 stars they are so nice its hard to be mad at them even thou they mess up pizza. They always try to give you the best deal, and are very polite.   But the pizza is always too small, and low quality. Not cooked enough, or cooked too much, too salty, and never flavorful. They need to take their time instead of blasting out a pizza in 15 minuets or less.   The wings have no flavor either.   Plus side its cheap, fast. the location is big, sit down option, and clean. But street parking can be a pain, and they will ticket you in this area."}
{"text":"They have a new location down the street from where they used to be and it looks like they have improved compared to the other comments. My order was done correctly and the pizza was good! Made well. No problem."}
{"text":"Went here to get pizza only to get cut off by one of there female drivers then have her tell me I cut her off! She cut off me and another person because she couldn't get back to Dominoes quick enough!"}
{"text":"My friends and I just had a very bad experience with the manager Irene at this location. We are on vacation and staying at the Riviera hotel and casino in Las Vegas. We received a phone call from Irene at 7:42 pm explaining to us that the pizza could not be delivered to our hotel and that someone would have to come over to some restaurant called the peppermill somewhere near the hotel to pick up the food. She didn't even apologize for the inconvenience and insisted that we come to the restaurant to pick up the order. When my friend's husband expressed his displeasure with the situation the manager Irene never offered any compensation for the inconvenience. Not once did she apologize or make any effort whatsoever to accommodate us in any way. I don't know if this is a common practice with this manager but what she failed to realize is that my friends and I all have worked in customer service at some point and we know that someone from that establishment should have called us to let us know that they couldn't deliver to our hotel way before the pizza was ready. The address was put into the system so there really is no excuse. They have lost us as customers for good. This was unacceptable and as a manager I know that she knows better"}
{"text":"I love pizza. It's absolutely one of my favorite foods to eat.  I have ordered from this location a few times. And the first couples times were great but just recently the quality has been going down rapidly.  I ordered a large plain cheese pizza, for pick up on October 7th, 2016 at 11pm, so an hour before they close. So when I called in the order the women working that night I've never talked to or heard of, but she was very friendly.   Although her personality does NOT make up for the absolutely HORRIBLE pizza I got that night.   So I arrived to pick up the pizza, and she seemed kind of in a rush but still had a smile so when she handed me my pizza and didn't show it to me I unfortunately gave her the benefit of the doubt and went on my way, thinking and trusting my order was good.  I got home 10 minutes later went to grab a slice and you can tell the cheese was barely even melted, so I picked the slice up and my dough was not even cooked!! On a pizza, how do you at least not cook the dough? It was disgusting.  A few times they have messed up, but gave forgiveness, but after this order and my dough wasn't even cooked!!   I will never be returning to Dominos ever again."}
{"text":"Second time getting pizza delivered today and it's my second time being disappointed. Both times the pizza wasn't even cut. I had to get out my own pizza cutter! I ordered hand-tossed pizza and what I got was about as thin as a piece of paper. I try to pick a piece up and it just flops down. The crust was uneven- thick on one half and super thin on the other half. It was warm, not hot. Tasted pretty salty. Not happy at all!!"}
{"text":"After calling in to order 10pizzas at 3:30 to be picked up at 5:15 I walked in at 5:15 to pick them up.  Guess what, the order had not been started yet! If this is the service you can expect they are in trouble."}
{"text":"We tried the Brooklyn crust last night, YUMMY! Everything was great except the pizza tracker was broken or something.  The delivery man was at the door and it said it was still in the oven?"}
{"text":"Domino's Pizza always seems to get a bad rap, especially for the quality of their pizza. Famously, they came in dead last in a U.S. nationwide taste test a couple years back and revamped their menu while running a series of self-deprecating ads. Me, I've never understood it. I liked Domino's then and I do now.  For me, the quality of their toppings, cheese and sauce has always been rather good for a major chain and I'll certainly take it over Pizza Pizza any day. They often have ridiculous specials (50% off and others) and when compared to similarly priced places like Pizza Pizza, 241, Gino's, etc. I think it's much better pizza. The staff at this particular location is always great...it's mostly younger kids but they're all friendly and helpful. Also, I don't think my pizza has EVER taken more than 15 minutes. Take that Pizza Pizza and your 20 minute guarantee!  One final tip: if you've never tried it, give their Pan Pizza a shot...it's clearly an attempt to emulate Pizza Hut's pie and even if it's not quite as good, it's pretty damned close. Oh and it's only $9.99 for a two topping medium, which is about half of what you'd pay at The Hut. Give it a try!"}
{"text":"I wanted to order a couple of pizzas for a friends b-day party.  Mobile seemed easy but nope.   Then laptop to place an order online.  Did it work nope.   I guess Domino's in Michigan decided to switch their ordering service and it didn't migrate the info.  What a headache!!!!!!!!! Don't order online it suks!  They should comp the first order it takes foreva! The re-entry of data and all that update stuff seems wasteful and reminiscent of horrible apps gone by. Bye Domino's it was fun."}
{"text":"On days when it gets to late to cook we come to this Dominos for pizza. Pizza is always cooked on time. One day without asking, they gave me an extra pizza because  they made a hand tossed instead of the pan pizza I ordered."}
{"text":"My pizza was good. But the staff is a little lost. And it was a long wait after I had already place my order an hour ahead of time."}
{"text":"Horrible customer service and stingy on toppings. The drivers are all older people who are extremly rude and you can tell they talk about how much the person tipped or not. I used to work at a Dominos around 2 years ago and I know all the ammount of toppings that should go on every type of pizza and this Dominos definitely puts less. The people working there seem clueless and the only reason we keep going back is because my husband loves Dominos pizza the most out of any pizza place and I love it but this particular one just seems to disappoint. I will admit that I heard it got a new managing system and it has gotten a little better..so Ill give them 2 stars for that reason."}
{"text":"Just wanted to give a huge shoutout to the employee named Ron who works at this establishment. Every time I have ever come in to get pizza he always greets my boyfriend and I with such a warm welcome. He is the reason why we come to this Dominos every time to get our pizza because of the excellent customer service that he provides. He is an outstanding employee and deserves a lot of praise for what he does. Thank you so much for being so kind and caring you have earned our business for life without a doubt"}
{"text":"Ordered a 2 pizzas and a soda. Got cold, terribly made pizza and didn't receive the soda. So I called back right after I received it to ask for a refund for the soda (not even the terribly made pizza), and Rob, a worker there, asks me...\"I don't understand what I can do about it?\" Well I would appreciate you find a way to get my money back for what I ordered and didn't get it. When I tell him that, he tells me that there's nothing he can do because they're closed and I should call back another day. What?!? Will never order from this location again."}
{"text":"There was a fly. Baked into the cheese. Under the pepperoni. Luckily my friend hates pepperoni. Gross."}
{"text":"The rude, plus-sized dark skin girl needs to be fired. She is so rude. If she hates being there she should quit. Bye."}
{"text":"I went in to pick up my last order, and they were slammed (it was dinner time, so was expected and it was fine, wasnt honestly any wait longer than I expected ) the guy making the pizzas in the back yells up to me that hes sorry about the wait ./ line, and says \" it takes a little longer because we add love to every thing we make\"  this kind of light hearted comment in the face of what some kids today would think to be a stressful situation made me enjoy my experience enough that I'm ordering again. I have not had Dominos since I moved to vegas almost 10 years ago, it just never occurred to me to order from them, but now its my second time in a month ordering from this store."}
{"text":"I really like Dominos but the inconsistency of this particular location is its downfall. If I pick up my pizza, it's fine. But whenever I have it delivered, it's always burnt. The cheesy bread shouldn't even be given to customers like this. And you know your pizza is burnt when your pepperoni starts curling up. I'm not one to call the store and complain. I just hope the restaurant manager sees my review and can improve in that department. Otherwise, good prices and friendly staff."}
{"text":"The pizza is just simply the BEST!!! I just started ordering from Dom in December 2014 and each of my orders has been outstanding! The pizza is always piping HOT! Delivery is always under the expected time. My drivers are always giving great customer service.  DOM gets 5 stars...."}
{"text":"Look, the pizza at this place always comes out tasting great (for a Domino's pizza), but it arrives so late. They always take so long that I get anxious that my order was misdelivered or one of my enemies was waiting in the bushes and sabotaged my pizza. My orders take an average of 50 minutes to arrive, far past their suggested 30 minutes. To top it all off, they never bring it up to my door, I have to go out and walk down my driveway and get it myself."}
{"text":"I thought they started to get back to making a decent pizza, but it's hit or miss... I like veggies on my pizza and pay for triple mushroom, onions and spinach and they barely put any on. Also, the thin and crispy is never crispy is never crispy!  Why don't you try taking half of your menu items off and get back to focusing on the pizzas!"}
{"text":"Update... After one year of not coming to this location, today 11/13/2016 I decided to give them another try and I placed an order and wow what a mistake that was! First things first when I go to pay for my order 30 telling me I can't use my gift card because I never registered to use a gift card with that location but you don't have to register a gift card nor do you have to register with a certain location.. I finally convinced them to swipe the damn card and lo and behold it worked so the guy at the register hands me my food 1 large pizza with pepperoni and double feta cheese and the Order of parmesan bites the large order. My pizza had no feta cheese, horribly undercooked and the parmesan bites or burnt and hard as a rock. It's been a year since I went to this location and as of today I can finally say without a shadow of a doubt never again. I'd like to apologize for my spelling and punctuation as I'm in the car and using voice to text and as we all know voice to text is very inaccurate and I'm so angry I'm not even going to proofread it"}
{"text":"I was hungry and the only place near me was dominoes so I went there and it was quick the pizza was fresh and it was amazing."}
{"text":"Come on Domino's. How hard is it to put the right ingredients on the pizza? I checked it twice before I placed the order. Can't you at least check the order once before it goes out the door?"}
{"text":"And this is why i always go to papa johns. First time trying this dominos in my area and just take a look at the pizza. Barely any cheese on it and you can even see the red sauce. Never ever going back to Dominos again."}
{"text":"Wow, this Dominos Pizza is awesome. Their new sauce is much better. They always have the best deals around. I love to be albe to order online and watch the tracker thing. I always know who made my pizza and who is delivering.  During football games I order wings. their wings taste much better than BWW. weird but true.  Their pizza taste so much better than most other delivered pizzas."}
{"text":"Worst service I have ever gotten. The employees like to lie and the District manager also lies. Had codes for free pizzas. So we were redeeming the coses for pizzas and handing them out to homeless people. We were told we can't order 10 free pizzas only 1 pizza to one code per person. We ordered 2 pizzas 2 different names they only allowed 1 pizza. I said you would allow 1 pizza per person. I had 2 people and was told that's all I'm getting and it's 1 pizza to 1 phone number.  They don't know what they are doing. Well that's why they work at good ol' Dominos. Keep up the good work. Y o u know who you are...."}
{"text":"Pizza was bland and visually inconsistent with previous order experience. Didn't include dipping sauce. Delivery time was absurd, took 1+ hours with no information on why from the store when we called. Driver was adorable, yet hysterical and in shambles. He was incoherent, unhelpful, yet tried to resolve the issues. When calling the store to inquire about the absurd delivery time, it was of zero help. The first lady was utterly useless, and the man on the second try provided somewhat of a helpful response. Had an overall terrible experience with Domino's, would think twice about ordering again."}
{"text":"I'm a little surprised by all of the really negative reviews. Their carry out is fast as hell, one time I swear it was ready in like 5 minutes and the pizza was bomb!  Delivery on the weekends sucks ass but is that really their fault? It's cheap, fast and in a highly populated residential area, what do you expect? I live 5 minutes away so I just do carry out.  As for the common complaint about \"small\" chicken wings. Hey, at least you know that it didn't come from growth hormone chickens, right?  I think this location is great, better than Papa Johns that's for damn sure."}
{"text":"If I could give negative stars, I would. Twice now, twice, I've waited over an hour and 45 minutes for my order. I ordered simple pasta, both times, and walked almost 2 hours for a place 10 minutes from me to deliver.  I tried to give them a second chance, I ordered, 20 minutes in, checked the tracker, said it had been \"double checked\", waited another 20 minutes and nothing changed. I called the store, told them, warned them this has happened before and that I didn't want it to happen again. Another hour went by and called the store, it was just leaving and they had other stops before mine.   How is it fair to ANYONE to wait 1.5+ hours to get their food because they have to wait for more orders? Every other needs to go out as it's finished.   I will NOT be ordering from this location again, dominos will be lucky if I order from another location this one has made such a bad impression on me."}
{"text":"Yes, I have the app. Yes, I order conveniently from my phone to have yummy salads, pizza or pasta delivered. Yes, I love the Pizza Tracker which tells you the time your pizza is put in the oven; until it's delivered. That's a pretty cool feature. Yes, I love a deal so with every six orders I get s free two-topping pizza.   These guys deliver promptly and are courteous. Currently, my favorite pizza is the crispy flat crust, veggie pizza. There is tons of veggies and cheese on it and it's super delicious. I like the Apple/pecan salad as well as the Caesar salad with chicken. I'm not going to lie; the lava chocolate crunch cake is pretty fabulous. Super excited that they carry an assortment of Ben and Jerry's ice cream. Munchy fix delivered!"}
{"text":"Tonight I ordered the medium pizza deal with a soda, parmesan bites, and cinnamon bites. I ordered one of the pizzas with alfredo sauce and when it was delivered, it came with some sort of garlic sauce. Not a big deal! I had my little sister call back to see if we could get the correct order and was put on hold. After several minutes, we received an apology and was told that the correct pizza would be delivered within a half hour. An hour and a half later, after no delivery, I personally called and spoke to a girl who gave me a little more than attitude when I told her the dilemma and asked me to hold. I then spoke to \"J.D.\" who quite rudely told me that he had taken my order and I did not in fact order alfredo sauce on my pizza and that when we were put on hold, I was to speak to him and hung up on him. Although completely untrue, I still apologized. J.D. continued to be rude to me. They told me that they'd deliver the correct pizza, which they did. I would have been more than happy to pay for it, however, the immense amount of \"sass\" I received from J.D., whom I assume is the manager, was extremely uncalled for and unappreciated."}
{"text":"So. I figure the highest rating a pizza CHAIN can get is 3 stars. So they get a perfect rating!   In terms of \"fast food\" or chain pizza, I think I am now a Domino's convert (after years of resistance to Mr. Rosie S.'s claims that Domino's beats Pizza Pizza, my usual go-to). Never thought I'd say that.  So here is the new rating system I have developed specifically for pizza.  CRUST TEXTURE:  Domino's uses cornmeal on the bottom of their crusts. It makes things extra crispy, and I love that. However, I'm not a huge fan of their heavy hand... I always end up with cornmeal all over my face. They have the best crust options: classic hand-tossed, hand-tossed thin, ultimate deep-dish, and crunchy thin.  CRUST FLAVOUR: The cornmeal can be tasted. The crust does NOT taste like cardboard anymore. The Domino's of my youth was a dry, icky-stale tasting, tough grossness. Their crust is great now - the regular is chewy but still has a crunch, and the thin manages to hold up against 4-5 toppings. The crunchy thin is my favourite - not like a light Italian-pizza style crust, but it is definitely crunchy. And there is no outer crust border, it is sliced into small squares rather than slice-shapes. Not a sweet dough like Pizza Pizza...   SAUCE FLAVOUR:  Not sweet - tangy and acidic, tastes like actual tomatoes. Has a bit of a peppery bite, too.    SAUCE AMOUNT:  You can choose to indicate how much sauce when ordering, even online. Their standard is a bit more than I like, so I ask for light on sauce.   CHEESE FLAVOUR: Tastes like cheese, not plastic... not QUITE real cheese, but closer than a lot of other cheapo places.  CHEESE AMOUNT:  Good. I wish they carried it out over the crust to the edge, though.  TOPPING QUALITY:  Fine. Not great, nothing interesting. Pizza Pizza has a better selection of topping options, but they tend to be of lower quality and they don't put much of those premium ingredients on your pizza when ordering. Domino's is solid, but not fancy. No caramelized onions, roasted peppers or broccoli here... They have 9 meat options (Pepperoni, Brooklyn Pepperoni, Sausage, Beef, Ham, Bacon, Chicken, Philly Steak, Anchovy), 3 cheese options (cheddar, provolone, feta) and 8 veggies (Hot Peppers, Black Olives, Green Olives, Green Pepper, Mushroom, Pineapple, Onion, Tomatoes) to choose from. No extras like spices or oils.  TOPPING AMOUNT:  Fine. Not noticeably stingy or heavy-handed.  D has a comment about toppings. The bacon on Domino's pizza just rolls off. He suggests a layer of cheese, followed by other toppings, followed by another layer of cheese. Perhaps we will request this in our next order and see what happens...  PRESENTATION:  So all the \"fast food\" pizzas lose in this category, clearly, but I would like to include how the pizza looks upon arrival and box-opening to the category. It always looks great from Domino's, except for the above-mentioned bacon migration.  OVERALL TASTE:  Better than Pizza Pizza... and doesn't make me feel sick.  Other notes: Domino's dipping sauces suck. Too thin, bad flavour. So do the containers. Sometimes I was to dip my whole pizza slice in the sauce, not just a crust or cheesy bread. Pizza Pizza sauce cups are short and fat - shallow; Domino's cups are taller and thinner - I can't get my stuff in there!!!  P.S. The cheesy bread is evil-good. Like disgustingly tasty."}
{"text":"It's still a chain fast-food restaurant but the products are surprisingly good!  Never been disappointed with the pizza.  The pasta portions are small but tasty!  Good service, delivery guys/gals very friendly and nice!"}
{"text":"We've ordered from here three times. First two times the pizza was wrong. This third time we both got really sick from the chicken. We ordered 2 pizzas and had one slice of the pizza so we know it was the chicken. This place is the worst dominos we've been to. We have to throw the pizza away this morning. We thought we would give them a few chances and now we're sick."}
{"text":"I have never had a problem :) Love it!  And you can't be mad at their times of operation either.  I was craving pizza so bad so I looked at the clock and realized it's 12:30am!!   \"Oh, noo!\" - I thought to myself in panic that I won't get to have that something I was craving so badly..  (I mean, you now how us/we women are with our cravings.   Thank You For working until 1am Dominos!  THANK YOU! :)"}
{"text":"This is my first time having dominos since I moved to Nevada. I ordered everything through the app which is easy and without a problem. The one thing I noticed is that I got lied to. As on the tracker it clearly says the pizza is being \"quality checked over\" I'm guessing that's some gimmick as when I received my custom buffalo chicken pizza there wasn't a drop of hot sauce on the pizza not to mention a single drop of chicken. Who does that!? Not to mention that the driver forgot my dipping sides of marinara and garlic dipping sauce for the Parmesan Bites. It's not about crying over the dipping sauce but I paid for it and I didn't receive what I got. Not to mention the sauces are over priced but I must have. I just hope that this dominos location actually checks on the pizza before they are at the door. I would rather get a phone call saying my pizza has to be remade because they made it wrong than getting a slap in the face of getting the excitement of a perfectly made pizza to my expectations."}
{"text":"This has been my go-to carry out pizza spot for a little over a year. I've never had an order that didn't meet my expectations and the staff have always been friendly and efficient."}
{"text":"This is for delivery guy Jordan. He brought Diet Coke by mistake and I told him it was not a big deal. Much to my surprise He showed up about 20 min later w regular coke! Thank you Jordan for great customer service!"}
{"text":"Twice now your employees have pissed me off.  Food is good. Limited seating inside. Their $7.99 triple meat carryout is still the best deal around IMHO."}
{"text":"Our family experienced a sever customer service deficit at this location, but that happens.  My rating for this experience was the reaction of Tiffany, the manager on duty.  She did not make excuses.  She apologized for my experience and then made it right.  That my friends is true customer service in an environment where I thought it was long dead. Way to go Tiffany!  You will be a regional manager before you know it."}
{"text":"Takes 40 minutes for one pizza and they are sending out a bunch of Pizzas for delivery. This is ridiculous and our pizza didnt even taste good! Very unhappy."}
{"text":"Ordering online is easy, as always. Delivery was on time and the guy was nice. But when we saw the pizza with some pieces of pasta like somebody messed around with it we decided not to eat it anymore"}
{"text":"This place is ready, prepared, they have their game faces on.  They all work together in unison.  They are friendly., Welcoming and not once have I gone inside and see a stink face.  This location is prompt. The pizzas are always well done , tasty and never have had an issue with my order.  The bf and I ordered 3 large pizzas for today's big event( super bowl ) I literally saw 4 employees walking out with pizzas to be delivered with 3 more cars parked outside for more deliveries.  Awesome to see that this location is doing well.  You guys are doing great! My go to spot for pizza."}
{"text":"Not big on reviewing chains but my local Domino's deserved a good review.  The pizza was very good and really has improved in taste over the years. We ordered large and medium pepperoni and both were full of toppings and good flavor.  The staff was efficient, friendly, and hard working. Lastly, the price was on point.  We had a coupon and got both pies for $16 out the door. Who can argue with that. Overall, good pie, service, and price. Deserving of a review."}
{"text":"I called this location 10 times. Total time trying to gat ahold of someone was 45mins. Once i got ahold of someone told them what i like they flipping hung up on me. Couldnt get through after that. I work at a hotel so I will no longer be telling my guest to order form here. I cant believe this, how do you expect to run a place if you employees are not answering the phones or hanging up on people. Wow."}
{"text":"This is what I received from dominos when I ordered pizza online. This black debri was covering a hole on the pizza itself. It is truly disgusting and unacceptable. The lack of care that our food is prepared with how can dominos expect me to eat this! They offered to bring me another pizza but I will no longer order or eat dominos pizza. It is unacceptable and to deliver something like that  who knows what is in it. The manager said well if you don't want a pizza what do you want me to do. Of course I don't want another disgusting pizza I want my money back I'm not going to pay for something I'm not going to eat is what i said. NeXT time think before you order at dominos."}
{"text":"The 2 stars is only because my pizza was ready really quickly after ordering online.  My pizza: I ordered thin crust, pepperoni, garlic and spinach on one side. What I received: Square cut, half burnt pizza with barely any sauce on it.  I order thin crust a lot at other pizza chains and never has it been this bad.  Maybe they just suck at thin crust.  I'll order a normal bake and maybe change my review if it's any good. It won't be any time soon though.  Trust me, go somewhere else. I prefer local joints but needed a fast lunch before work, and I paid the price for it."}
{"text":"I have ordered from Dominos many times in the past year. But tonight will be the last. They state 2 for $5.99 then lead you to what is available for that price. I always order the chicken wings, usually two of the 8 piece. Tonight after I ordered when checking out the wings were at $6.99. I called Dominos to inquire and a very rude girl talked to me like i was stupid. She told me the bone in wings went up a dollar but no where on the site did it say that. She wasn't listening to me and just spouted words and was rude. Dominos, FIRST you need to fix your prices under your coupon page and second HIRE people who want to be there. Many people would like to have a job in this city who would really appreciate the work, with a good attitude.."}
{"text":"Dominos is always better than Pizza Hut. Wish they had the 50% coupon more often!! Go with the thin crust pizza or Brooklyn style pizza."}
{"text":"Ordered a pizza online around 10:30pm tonight, paid for the order and waited a few minutes. My girlfriend and I received a call that they do not deliver to our part of town (S Nellis Blvd and Vegas Valley) after dark. Annoyed, my girlfriend just asked them to cancel the order. What a waste. Going with a competitor instead."}
{"text":"We don't have Domino's very often but a coupon brought us back. And it just wasn't good. My thin crust, wasn't. My well done, wasn't. It was just not good. I'll be sticking with Pizza Nova for the best pizza from a chain restaurant."}
{"text":"Order Online , easy fast and simple to use. placed my order got it in a timely matter ,still piping hot , delivery guy was polite , reading all the bad reviews i was kinda hesitant but over all good experience"}
{"text":"Domino's CAN tend to be hit and miss depending on location but this location delivers quality every time. The staff has gotten familiar with my order and treats me like a regular, which is kind of nice. Wings are very good (for pizzeria wings) and the Philly steak pizza is a Domino's fave for us."}
{"text":"I wish I could give less than one star. I dont know WHY I keep trying with this dominos but after tonight, I know I won't try again. 1. ordered a pizza from them a while back and it arrived after an hour and a half freezing cold and folded in half like the box had been dropped before it was delivered to me. I complained and dominos customer service told me the manager from that location would get in touch with me within 24 hours to resolve. after a week and a half no one contacted me so I contacted them back and they apologized and gave me a $10 gift card.  2. wanted to use my gift card from issue #1 so I ordered a pizza. after over an hour (again), they arrive with two pizzas and told me they made my pizza wrong the first time so they had to make another one (hence why it took so long). I appreciated the extra free pizza that they brought. but how hard is it to follow order directions?? 3. tonight. my dad asked me to order pizza for us so I placed the order at 8:45. we're tracking the pizza online and by 9:45 it still hasn't even left the store yet. Our pizza got here at 10:30, almost TWO HOURS later and it was freezing cold. this Dominos is less than 2 miles from my house. and it took them almost two hours to deliver our cold ass pizza.  Never again will I even bother with this location. Its obviously run by someone who doesn't care and employs people who also don't care."}
{"text":"This place discriminates. Why the hell have store in south phoenix if you are not going to deliver to the people in SOUTH PHOENIX.? Bad customer service and bad ethics. This place sucks"}
{"text":"This Dominos really outdoes itself, we order a couple toimes a month and they re fast, polite and often include a couple paper plates/napkins!"}
{"text":"Worst customer service! Cashier was rude and unprofessional! If you don't like your job then you shouldn't come to work!!!"}
{"text":"Shout out to pizza maker Davis (if that is his real name, as noted on Dominos.com) and the deliveryman for the late night grub.  Dominos.com removes most human interaction from the ordering process, which is just perfect for someone already committed to being a hermit for the remainder of the night. I ordered a large thin crust pie with pepperoni, mushrooms, and ham. But that wasn't enough carbs. In addition, I added regular breadsticks with a side of garlic sauce. Lastly, I threw in a 2-liter bottle of Coke Zero to wash all that down.  On the website I watched Pete, who's a cartoon pizza maker, create my masterpiece. The meter flashed whenever a step was in progress. My pizza arrived within 30-40 minutes. I don't recall the name of the deliveryman, but he shared with me how there were a ton of people ordering pizzas that night. (Must be all those gamers who required proper nourishment). Anyways, he was cool guy.  The pizza was pretty tasty (great job, Davis!). Next time, I'll pass on the garlic sauce and order a side of ranch to also use on my pizza. *Homer Simpson drool*"}
{"text":"Came in, was greeted and ordered quickly. The young lady up front is super fast at what she does. Answering the phone, taking my order, then answering another call all while placing stickers on boxes and telling people what to do with her hands. Great service to not only me but the people after me as well.  I don't normally review fast food, but I'm bored waiting for  my food and thought I'd appreciate the young lady that helped me."}
{"text":"Pizza is delicious when it arrives they always get my orders right, Delivery is getting better and better I have been ordering from this place several times and they don't disappoint me at all.  Keep it up guys :)"}
{"text":"Made an order over the app like I've done at least a dozen times in the past. With the business of fight night I was given a 90 minute wait. After 100 minutes I called and politely asked the status of my order.  He had to look and when returned only said, \"Its going to be a long while dude.\"  I would've preferred an actual estimate of time or acknowledgement that they forgot my order but they didn't. If they are too busy since it's fight night that's fine. The manager needs to staff extra drivers.  To have no estimate of when I may get my order is bull. Run your business properly."}
{"text":"Ordered pizza at 10:30pm using an excellent coupon ($7.99 Mon through Thurs carryout). I usually order online and pick it up on the way home.  I got a call saying that they were having security issues and changed door closing from midnight to 10pm so the pizza would need to be delivered.  I had no issue with this since my card was already charged.  I had no problem adding a $4 tip for the driver.   When the pizza was delivered, I noticed an additional $5.50 charge.  When I called the store manager, he said that there was a delivery charge and that the coupon could not be used because it was not a \"carry out\".  I tried to explain that I had NO CHOICE for the delivery since they changed the door closing time and the coupon should still be honored.   The cost of the delivery charge along with the tip cost more than the pizza!   I contacted the corporate headquarters to try to make sense of this.... It's NOT the money... it's the absurdity of the matter.  Other than a \"we are sorry\" email.... no word from Dominos.  It's sad.  I've been a long time customer.... but when the absurdity outweighs common guest service... maybe it's time to say bye bye."}
{"text":"Have ordered from here for the past 2 years and it's always inconsistent and not the quality of Domino's in other locations. Occasionally it's bad enough to warrant money back and then I don't order again for a long time.   It shouldn't be this way. To be specific the pasta bowl is so empty that it seems as though you are just ordering the bread bowl portion and it is the only thing that fills you up. The pasta ranges from no sauce to nothing but sauce. Used to be my favorite thing to order back home in WA and l loved it every time. Not here.  My Last order, Hand Tossed, Pan Pizza, over cooked, not cheesy or any good, the cinnamon sticks  burnt and crunchy, not worth eating. I called and the manager said she could not credit us that they were really busy and the next order is free. I am so sick of having to pay for something that isn't even mediocre and knowing that I have to order again to try and make it worth it when the chances of the food being bad as it has for the last 2 years is pretty good."}
{"text":"I've been getting pizza from here for about 5 years. Here's a check list if you're going here.  1. Don't order delivery. You'll wait an hour. 2. If you order carry out, wait for the tracker to say it's ready before leaving. You'll still get there before it's ready.  3. Check the pizza to make sure all your toppings are accounted for. 4. Make sure the pizza isn't burned. 5. Always get the carry out special. If you don't you're paying WAY too much. 6. Be nice to the people. They're friendly. They just don't know how to make pizza on time."}
{"text":"Once again a failure . I redeemed my two free pizzas that were grated to me from my last disappointing order. And as if I thought it couldn't get any worse..... not to my surprise it was. Again ordered my regular pizza , pan pizza with pepperoni  (I ordered it well done as suggested by the restaurant worker on the phone) it still came under done and horrible. The slices were uneven and haphazardly cut. The dough  was also uneven and the toppings  (only pepperoni , how hard can it be? ) were poorly placed. The thin crust pizza was also poorly assembled and cold. The sauce tasted rancid.  Unfortunately I have no option but to stop ordering from this place . I wish I could order from my old location it was fantastic.  Please please corporate Dominos audit this store read the yelp reviews,  please get new management and quality standards.  Sorry Dominos you have lost this customer. I guess I have to order Pizza Hut if I want cheap pizza. :(  The one star on this review is for the deliver driver he was nice."}
{"text":"Usually I get what I ordered. Unfortunately the last 2 times they seem like they can't cook my pizza throughly. I stopped using Marco's Pizza for that very reason. This is my last time ordering for Domino's. Not that hard to cook a pizza or so I thought. Delivery driver was prompt and very pleasent. Tipped him $10."}
{"text":"If I could give zero stars I would. I don't know if there has been an ownership change at this location recently or something but my last couple orders have been wrong, over cooked and not even edible. I literally just threw the food away and did not ask for a replacement, I'm done."}
{"text":"I came into this dominos and haven't ordered dominos for a long time. I asked if they had any pizzas ready as I was on the road and was looking to save time. The guy looked at me like I had just killed his dog and told me \"we don't do ready made pizzas\". I thought the guy was going to call the police on me after asking such a terrible question. So I put a medium pizza order in and sat in my car for 15 mins waiting for the pizza.   A pizza place that doesn't have any pizzas ready for walk in customers. What stellar customer service. That's why I have been going to Piara Pizza lately because they always have pizzas ready.  Not to mention I had a 4 hour drive back to LA. Oh, and I won't even get into the look I got when I didn't know what kind of crusts they had to chose from. It's like I broke the fundamental laws of the universe not by knowing how dominoes pizza works."}
{"text":"Love this place. The crew is great. For fast delivery pizza, you can't beat it."}
{"text":"My husband just bought a pizza. My husband asked how much for a large pepperoni he said  $18 my husband said that is to much, then he said  $14 then my husband asked how much for a medium  $11 my husband said I take it then the guy said I could give you a large for  $10.99."}
{"text":"I always get decent pizza from here but every time I get wings they're tiny. These wings are slightly bigger than a quarter. If I order 8 wings I expect that those wings are a good size."}
{"text":"Every time we order from here something is wrong. Pizza is cold. We ordered wings the had no sauce yea no hot sauce at all. You can't expect much from a chain pizza place but this location is horrible. The service woah it's like you are asking them to much to correct your order."}
{"text":"Just happened to walk into my fave Domino's......and I discovered it's this location's 1st. Anniversary !  They did their usual great job w / my Brooklyn-stlye adding extra sauce!  Nice people workin' there.....they've got my biz as long as they're open !"}
{"text":"This is what my pizza looked like when I opened my box that got delivered. It was obvious the driver probably took a third mm too fast, not to mention their was a small bug in the box that moved too fast for a photo. I didn't even bother calling the manager as I've had to once before when they brought me a 20oz soda rather than the 2 liter I had paid for and the manager was really rude. So after throwing this pizza in the trash can I just don't do business at this site any longer."}
{"text":"I love the app and how our order is always ready and yummy"}
{"text":"Pizza is better than frozen but only by a small margin.  What I like about it is; I could bring it home and nobody will touch it because they don't like the taste.  It is leftover safe by that method.  I really don't like it either but I like to tease the family"}
{"text":"Very good location! My online orders are always correct and are delivered on time. The only thing that could use improvement are the attitudes of some of the delivery drivers. Being nice doesn't cost anything."}
{"text":"Delivery was fast and pizza was food although it was lacking pepperoni. Cinnamon sticks were amazing though which is the main reason for 4 stars! We enjoyed on tracker online to see when our order was being made and delivered"}
{"text":"Last night we ordered from this location, my pizza had hair in it. This is after the delivery guy attempted to hold on to $20 in a tip and we had to gang up on him to get it back. Then when they redelivered the pizza over 30 mins later,  it still came with hair. I think it's absolutely ridiculous and nasty for kitchen workers not to wear gloves or hairnets and still deal with cash. This location and the workers are disgusting and they should be closed down before they get someone really sick."}
{"text":"Pan pizza was absolutely delicious. Everyone in the store was super pleasant. Great experience."}
{"text":"Typical drunk kids.   I went here on my lunch break to pick up food for my office around 3 am and it was full of drunk college students falling over and just being obnoxious. The guy behind the counter was picking a giant chunk of food out of his teeth the whole time. Super appealing."}
{"text":"Called after waiting nearly an hour, estimated wait was 14-24 mins. Was told they only had one driver and \"didn't know where he was\" and to call back. Called back again and sat on hold. FAIL  Was texted by driver more than TWO hours later..."}
{"text":"The Del Webb store is my favorite by far. I have had the same order from other locations and it is not nearly as good. Always fresh, hot and fast. Will really miss them when we move."}
{"text":"The other night I ordered pizzas on my dominos app one redeeming my free pizza i earned for ordering through dominos so much. My order took over half an hour in quality check and then was canceled. I got a text from chase asking if it was fraud which I understood was a mistake and I cleared the alert. They never called me to tell me why they canceled or even asked for another form of payment which ibwouldve gladly done with cash at the door but either way I tried to call and I was on hold for over an hour and my friend tried calling also and he was too. I tried to order through the app again since we were hungry which was only one pizza this time (because my free pizza redeemable points went away with the last order) and they did the SAME THING and inexplicitly canceled again. Now I have to call dominos to figure out how to get my points back and the whole process was a disappointment and a pain"}
{"text":"This is the WORST dominos to order from. Several times i have placed an order and the online tracker said it had been \"checked for perfection\" and on its way and waited literally hours with no pizza at my door. i have called to complain and find out where my pizza is and the guy on the phone just says oh we are waiting for the delivery guy to get back, should he about 30 minutes. why is be delivering smithing pizza when mine was supposedly done over an hour ago?!?!?! WORST DELIVERY SERVICE AND BAD CUSTOMER SERVICE!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"They always do a nice job we only do pickup but order is correct staff is friendly and the pizza is a good value."}
{"text":"Ordered online. Recieved a confirmation number. No delivery.  Called and was told the order was never recieved.  Don't waste your time with this restaurant."}
{"text":"Same old utility style pizza.  Great when in a hurry or delivery.  Chain pizza needs a facelift!"}
{"text":"I grabbed pizza from here a couple of times.  The first time I just ran in to pickup one of their $5.99 specials, and the second was a phone order.  The phone order was about 6pm on a Friday night and they told me to the order would be ready in 20 minutes --the order was for 1 cheese pizza.  When I arrived to pickup the pizza, they stated that is wasn't quite ready.  20 minutes later, my amazing cheese pizza was ready to take home --I'm thinking someone forgot to put the order in.  The pizza was the typical Domino's pizza, plenty of sauce, crust, cheese and sodium, and pretty tasty, of course.  This location is a pickup only shop and was pretty clean for the most part."}
{"text":"I ordered pizza before 1 and it didn't arrive until around 3:30 and everyone was asleep at that point. It was also cold by the time it arrived. I will never order from dominos again"}
{"text":"I ordered online. The delivery took longer than the estimate said. The delivery driver did not come up to my apartment. He called me to come down and meet him. I want my delivery drivers to deliver the entire way, all the way to my door. The thin-crust pizza tasted good. The Coke tasted like Coke and was cold."}
{"text":"God Love these Guys!!!! My Husband and I bought our house 7 years ago, and we love that our location has a huge variety of take out/delivery.  Don't get me wrong, we love cooking, and we are very healthy guys(yes we're two gay guys).  What I mean is that we love cheat food....  Having a dominos this close is pretty awesome, add that we introduced ourselves when we first moved to the neighborhood and its been pretty rad ever since.  We're not the fat kid loving cake eating kids, but we do love to indulge.  When we order from there, we love how laid back, yet professional the staff has been.  We can call or order online, and our delivery guy/girl has always been appreciative and professional.  Owning a restaurant business has always pushed us to tip 20%, but we are very crucial, customer oriented people, so it really means a lot when we actually do.  I can honestly say that I have never tipped these guys less than 20%. In fact, I can tell you an awesome experience we had last fall when we ordered dominos on Halloween, because we were bored and there were no kids coming down our cup-de-sac.  Our niece came over to help pass out candy, but after 3 hour of no kids we decided to order pizza and enjoy all the extra pizza... NO JOKE, after about 2 minutes of ordering the pizza we started getting a swarm of kids, I called dominos and asked if they could add an extra 8 pizzas to our order and the manager said absolutely!!!  That was the best answer I could get.  I ended up giving the delivering driver Devin 3 jumbo size bags of full size snicker and Kit Kat because I really appreciated him working that night, and told him to share with the nights staff. . . We also tipped hime 50 bucks, because he walked up to our door, whispering boooooooo.  This is the type of customer service that makes the difference in reviews... so, to get to the point... This dominos  is awesome, the employees are awesome, and I hope you will have the same experience when ordering from them!    -Jamie"}
{"text":"Love to be able to create your own pizza. Light sauce and cheese. Fast only 20 min."}
{"text":"Everyone in our family likes their pie a certain way so we often have special requests.  Domino's always makes it perfectly, the way we order it and is always made to our exact specifications.  We generally pick up on the way home from work and it is still hot and delicious when we dig into it at home!  Service is exceptional.  The team at this location is always friendly, smiling and welcoming every time you walk through the door.  You can tell every customers experience is important to them.  I guess that's why they've been serving the Solon community for over 20 years when others have come and gone."}
{"text":"Location is very convenient from where I live, and while Pizza Pizza is even closer, I much prefer Dominos (or any other pizza chain) over them any day. While their location is convenient and easy to find, the parking situation leaves much to desired.  It can get a little difficult to get in and out and the spaces are cramped.  Dominos has a rewards/points program which is beneficial to anyone who has Dominos often. Delivery is also made easy with an online account where you can save your favourite orders.  Lately we've ordered their Managers special (4 topping large) on a thin hand tossed crust with cheesy bread, and it's been perfectly made each time.  I haven't tried much of their other side items, but the wings look decent enough if you're looking for a pizza/wings combination. For the cheesy bread, I find it goes great with the marinara sauce, but I wouldn't suggest having it without any dip as it might get a bit salty halfway through."}
{"text":"I wish I could give 0 stars. After the last time I ordered a pizza and it took 1 1/2 hours to deliver after being quoted 30 mins I was miffed. Then I tipped the driver $7 after he thru the pizza at me and was all pissy. Ordered a pizza online at 12:39 was in the oven at 12:41, out for delivery at 1, then I get a call saying it will be another 30 mins. I said your \"tracker\" said it was delivered and the foreign woman said it's not accurate. I said well maybe you shouldn't have it then. BOTH times they say they're waiting for there driver to get back. Maybe you should hire more drivers. Thank god I pay with cash and don't need my CC refunded bc that would never happen. Side note I live 9 minutes away. I should of just went in to pick it up."}
{"text":"I was so sad to read the reviews of this Dominos. I have ordered from them a few times and loved it! In fact my family is big on Papa Johns and they liked this Dominos so much they started ordering from here too!  I order from here at 3:21 pm today and I don't get my order till 4:13 pm that's the first problem. I tip the guy because its hard to find my house and he found it with no problem...now I'm regretting that. Only because my pizza was cold when I received it. Then I asked for light cheese and I pretty much got dough with veggies barely any sauce and probably enough cheese just to keep the veggies on the pizza. The pizza was so thin I could make a better pizza myself! Next time Digiorno frozen pizza would be better! I will post pictures of my pizza. Avoid this place at all cost will never order here again!!!"}
{"text":"Worst customer service! This Domino's needs BETTER management & friendlier employees! Waited for my pizza 1 hour and half, to be told my order was never placed & if I still wanted still want my pizza, I was going to have to wait another 30minutes. That's unbelievable. Won't be ordering from this dominos ever again"}
{"text":"I'm not usually a fan of these chain pizza restaurants, but I have to say this location has their act together! 2 pizzas, 2 toppings, $5.99 each. I ordered online for delivery and was able to follow the progress of my order from \"being made\" to \"out for delivery\". The order was placed and delivered to my door in less than 30 minutes....Kudos to Domino's of Boulder City Nevada"}
{"text":"Terrible customer service! I called over the phone to ask a basic question and the manager couldn't answer a simple question. I asked to look at the box and read me the dimensions. She said no immediately. I was going to order 10 extra large pizzas for my staff from here but I will go spend my money else where. Funny how crappy this food chain is ran."}
{"text":"Awesome fresh pizza every time and FAST delivery...  Very friendly delivery men and they are always very sweet and professional.  Way better than papa johns that's out this way."}
{"text":"Stay away from here! With all the pizza options saturating our area do yourself a favor and go anywhere else but here. I am a pizza lover and a sucker for a good deal so I convinced myself to get a carryout order from this Dominos. I arrived after the pizza tracker said my order is ready and I guess my fair skin has  turned my invisible because I seriously stood there in front of the counter for 6 minutes without being acknowledged. I know 6 min doesn't seem like a long time but it is. The girl who was pasting labels on boxes never once looked up at me. Weird. A man was on bench next to me waiting for his order and told me he was ignored for a while also. I understand they are busy and I could see everyone working but then 3 different employees walked right by me. Finally I said \"Hello?\" and a man came up to me and asked me to give him a minute, adorable! He then gave me my order. Time: 13 minutes after I arrived. The pizza was cold and the sauce I paid extra for was missing. Waste of money but even more so, my time!  I will never order from here again...and my thighs will thank me for this anyway."}
{"text":"This is definitely one of the worst locations to get your pizza. Way too expensive ($30!?), missing toppings and way too dry. Have tried this locations couple of times, but definitely won't be coming back. I wish they learned to make real good pizzas!"}
{"text":"Love the app & text ordering. I had a pricing issue, and management contacted me within 24 hours and resolved the problem. I appreciate how they value my business."}
{"text":"Horrible service from this Dominos.  Now I know basically what to expect from this chain but even this is absurd.  Won't answer the phone, deliveries are slow and staff has no idea what they are doing.  Our last order was made online and ended up being 2 hours late.  We ended up having to go over there only to find it was driving around town in a delivery car for a half hour.  No offer of anything to make good.  Staff was acting like little kids and it appeared there was no manager at the store.  Other families were having similar issues.  We eventually got the pizzas but they were over baked and dry.  Do yourself a favor and go to Mario's down the street. It's more expensive but you'll thank me!"}
{"text":"This Domino's location use to be good but it's horrible now. Stay away from this location. I ordered several times for carry out,they are very skimpy with sauce and toppings even though your paying for it. You would think after a few complaints they would improve but I guess the manager does not care until sales plummet at this location. Plenty of pizza places around will give my business to another place."}
{"text":"Customer service is not their strong suit, I tell you that! Very unprofessional. Dominoes has never been my go to place for pizza. Don't waste your time."}
{"text":"Used to order from this location a lot, but in the past year they have gotten worse and worse with quality and especially delivery. Food is OK at best, normally arrives warm not hot, pizzas and breadbowls have gotten sloppier, one time an Alfredo bowl tasted foul, like the sauce had been left sitting overnight to rot. Delivery time on non peak times is still over 2 hours. What's that, pizza tracker? My order has been delivered an hour ago? Funny, I'm still hungry... Must be because its been 2 hours since I ordered and I still don't have a pizza.  Will be switching to pizza hut until they're under new management. Someone should point them to these reviews in case they don't know already."}
{"text":"This location is always spot on. Every order is correct, and they are FAST!!   Tonight the driver (Greg I think?) called when he arrived and met me outside to prevent from waking up my baby.   Ordering online is so easy too!"}
{"text":"Mediocre at best. Better than pizza Pizza but that's not saying much! Try Il paesano if you want good pizza in the area."}
{"text":"Do not order from here ever. This store is a joke. They made me wait over 90 minutes and then dropped my bread bowls on the floor in front of my house. They then expected me to pick it up and eat it. Who does that!!!  Go to the store on Decatur they took care of me even when it wasn't their stores fault. They understand what customer service is about not this store.  Here is the review I wrote in the Decatur stores page. They deserve all the business.  Amazing service today guys! I recommend you order from the Dominoes on Decatur not the one on Blue Diamond. Let me tell you what happened today. I ordered three bread bowels from the store on Blue Diamond around 5:20 pm. 6:45 came around and still no delivery. I called and was on hold for 20 minutes and no one answered. So I called the store on Decatur and explained what happened to Jon. He tried to call the store for me as well however they didn't answer for him either. While I was on the phone with Jon from the Decatur store the delivery driver from the Blue Diamond store shows up and drops the bread bowls all over my front door step. He looked at me like he expected me to pick it up and eat it. I told him to take it back and credit my account. I now explained this to Jon from the Decatur store and he apologized for that stores behavior and sent me three free bread Bowls from his store. I totally didn't expect that but how amazing is that. Jon you really made our night and we appreciate you. You deserve a raise for going above and beyond even when your store was not the store that messed up. You made me feel different about Dominoes and I won't let the Blue Diamond store alter my opinion at all because of you. Thank you!"}

{"text":"Always great food. Thank you Domino's. Wish I could eat here more often. Great team of people working here."}
{"text":"This review goes out to the extremely sweet and very helpful employee named Waqar.   Waqar was very very patient and helpful as I was placing my order.  For the coupon that I had I needed to place my order on line.  I was unaware of this.  Waqar was very helpful and maintained a friendly smile.  He is always smiling and kind to all of the customers.   Thanks so very very much."}
{"text":"I hate giving bad reviews, but I'm done with this dominos. They take forever to deliver and the pizza is usually over cooked or the order is messed up. Don't waste your time and money on this place."}
{"text":"Im Honestly sure this dominos doesn't even do delivery. Every time I want to deliver, it can't happen. They Dont have any services to deliver. Its so annoying."}
{"text":"To start with...I work for Google. I rarely give negative reviews but in this case it seems inevitable. First after working in the Charlotte area for over a year, I have ordered probably every week from Dominoes. So you would think with my history...which (excellent) they would not second guess my order. Well I was wrong. I ordered my usual order at 10:49 which they also have with their so called sophisticated software. After an hour I called back complaining I had not received my order. I was put on hold and never addressed again. At 12am they closed.  When I called back they had closed? No call back... no apology...no food.   This is where it get almost hilarious. I get a strange call today from a number. Called back and it was Dominoes (Store #8968 7900-K Stevens Mill Rd Matthews, USA USA) the store I had ordered from the night before. Talked with an inept General Manager that said they had troubles with the hotel I was staying at (Microtel Inn & Suites by Wyndham Matthews/Charlotte-1603 Matthews-Mint Hill Rd, Matthews, NC 28105). I know nothing about Charlotte Hotels but I got their name off hotel literature of who to call for food. The General Manager then said he was going to talk to upper management and hi night-time manager about the problem. If you advertize and take peoples order then food should be delivered. I think that is called discrimination due to creed. He obviously didn't care about the fact that I had to get dressed the night before and drive somewhere to get something to eat. He offered me nothing even though I had a paid receipt. He said it had been cancelled. No apology...no coupon...no food.... I will never order from this and maybe any Dominoes again.  This franchise store is obviously run unprofessionally and without direction. Management does not have answers which makes you wonder about the quality of food preparation...  Horrible service...unprofessional...unreliable! Stay away until they get a new General Manager."}
{"text":"Had the worst pizza night EVER! I placed an order at Dominos online for 2 large pizzas and cinnamon bikes. It said 15-23 minutes till the order would be ready for pickup. My wife and I got there 30 minutes later. Waited 5 minutes in line while they corrected a mistake on another customer. When they get to me I am told that they \"forgot\" to cook \"one of the items\", the ciny bites. Made me wonder when the guy that was right in front of me had a problem with his order and the cashier said \"Here are some cinnamon bites to make up for your inconvenience.\" SO I know where my bites went. After 15 more minutes they bring out my order (50 minutes after ordering). I checked the pizzas and the order was wrong. I had 2 pepperoni/mushrooms. One was supposed to be pepperoni/sausage. The guy waiting on me took the entire order into the back without speaking a word. Nothing and he didn't come back out front while I stood there. I assumed they were remaking the order, so I went outside to wait for them to remake my order. After 35 more minutes (now up to 85 minutes) I went back into the shop and asked about my order. The guy (a different guy) went in the back to get my stuff. 5 minutes later he comes out empty handed and goes to the computer to look up the order. \"You ordered this and hour and a half ago. Did you run out of gas or something? Haha...\" I wasn't smiling. I asked to speak with the manager. \"He's working the oven right now.\" and no movement to get him. I yelled with my meanest \"Dad Voice\" \"I want to see the manager!\" He came right out and offered to help me. He went to find my order and came back with it in less than a minute. \"Here you go.\" No sorry for the delay, nothing. I lost it. I ripped him a new anal opening, then he started apologizing, over and over again. He ended up comping the food. (Now 100 minutes). We went home and opened the pizza boxes...he had given me the SAME pizzas I had refused initially! The box was chewier than the pizza (110 minutes). I called the store and spoke to the asst manager (manager wouldn't come to the phone to speak with me) and he said he would personally remake the pizzas and they would be ready in 10-minutes. I got back in the car and drove down the again. He met me at the curb with 1 pizza (the one they forgot to make). I gave up the battle and went home. All together 2 hours to get 1 pizza and a bunch of cardboard. DOMINO'S SUCKS!!!"}
{"text":"Unbelievably irresponsible customer service. This is my first 1 star rating on yelp and I award it to this establishment for its incredible ability to make ordering a pizza difficult AND frustrating! Even before placing my order I was greeted with what sounded like an annoyed and bored employee who directed me to call another dominos which had me call ANOTHER dominos which then had me call THIS one again. This time after realizing I was the same guy, the employee raised his voice at me and said \"you have to call the other one, YOU HAVE TO CALL THE OTHER ONE!\" And hung up on me. If I would have been as disrespectful as he, it would be reasonable to hang up but it wasn't like that at all. This guy would've done the same, be it me, my grandma or girlfriend and I hope management MANAGES it."}
{"text":"This place does what they need to do.  We had friends coming over last minute to watch the Badger game, and needed snacks.  I didn't have any dough defrosted, so we ordered.    Our food was ready in 15 minutes or so, and everything was as ordered.  Also, one person was gluten free and they do have GF pizzas."}
{"text":"Always come to order in store and was able to get out of the door pretty quick. Love the pizza, good price, can't complaint."}
{"text":"When the delivery driver arrived I watched her get our pizza out of the trunk of her car. No big deal. But when we opened our pizza it looked like all the cheese had slid off, probably from the pizza box sliding around while she was driving. And not to mention the pizza wasn't even cut all the way. We prob won't order from this place again."}
{"text":"Everytime I order from here it's the worst service. The food come LATE as hell, 2 hours and the order is wrong. And the guy who answers the phones is rude as hell. If it's late and everything is closed but this place your better off starving"}
{"text":"Driver forgot drinks. Driver said drinks were in his car but it took 15 mins to get my drinks. Found out driver forgot to bring drinks. Eating cold food now. Will not order from again."}
{"text":"I feel so ripped off. Let me start by saying that the customer service and delivery guy were awesome. The nicest people. In fact, the food is delicious. I just think the value ( what you get for what you pay) is lacking. The large Brooklyn style pizza is small. The new specialty chicken is small amount of food for what you pay. I would love to give this Dominos a 5 but I just can't."}
{"text":"The pizza was delivered in less than 25 minutes.  The driver was very nice and courteous.  The system online was very accurate and I was very pleased with my experience.  Excited to use them in the future."}
{"text":"Was seriously hungry, staying at a hotel in a city I have never been to before. Thought pizza, thought DOMINOS . I am a big fan of Dominos pizza. But today may have ended my love for them. First off pizza box was warm.. pizza however was not.  Specifically asked for a well done pizza. My dough was mushy, crust was soft and had no crisp to it. Very very disappointing.  I loved the 50%off online order special. But didnt think it meant getting a 50% cooked pizza. Soda was warm and fizzed everywhere upon opening. Wish i could get my tip back. Its so late i dont even want a redelivery. Ill take my money elsewhere tonight and take this pizza right where it belongs, the outside dumpster on my way out to a hopefully open carls jr or whatever is around here. If your in Tolleson AZ do not order from this Dominos.    Order Details  Order #: 602810  Date: 07/11/2016 9:34PM (pizza arrived 10:40pm) 5030 W Mcdowell Rd Ste 51 Phoenix, AZ 85035 602-233-2323"}
{"text":"Normally when the delivery comes, I pay, take the food and then check the order... Every single time I add (extra dipping sauces) , not the ones that would come included with wings or breadsticks, they would always forget to bring it. This time I decided to check before paying ? No sauce! Last time I called to complain, they said they wouldn't send back a delivery guy just for the sauce, finally they agreed to send me one, this time I asked em to bring me the sauce before paying..."}
{"text":"Always consistently on the mark, cooked perfect, no complaints....pizza, sandwiches, breads, lava cake all good....have not tried pasta....wasnt a fan of the chicken....orders are fast, delivery time is acceptable..."}
{"text":"I would just like to say how impressed I am with the outstanding customer I received. Not only did the store fix the problem from the order the night before, they brought lunch for everyone. WOW.  Thank you very much management team for your excellent communication and thanks Brandon for explaining what had happened the night before.  Customer 4 Life!"}
{"text":"TL;DR: Don't EVER get their cheesesteak sandwich.  Long version:  I'm graciously giving 3 stars as my (online) order was correct, and delivered in a timely fashion, by a friendly driver, so I don't want the store to suffer.  And the Hot Wings were fine, nothing special but hey it's Domino's.    But I feel compelled to point out ... and again, this is nothing on this particular store as the food was hot and I'm sure prepped per Corporate Specs ... but MAN ... do not EVER get a Philly Cheesesteak from Domino's.    I'm certain that they are not in any way freshly prepared, but rather delivered pre-made from the commissary (perhaps frozen) and they just run 'em through the pizza oven to heat 'em up.    IOW, I guarantee there's no grill at Domino's where they're grilling steak and peppers and onions and making you a cheesesteak.  Not even close.    The bread on the thing is all scrunched down like it came from out of a panini press which is NOT how a cheesesteak roll should be.  But worse than that ... and I'm not kidding when I say that every bite of the tasteless 'sandwich' delivered ... was like biting into a pillar of salt.  And I LIKE salt, okay?  But this ... was ridiculous.  Probably was about 4000mg of sodium in the 8\" sandwich.  I took 4 bites and threw it away ... and I was STARVING.  Plus the meat amount was TINY (suppose that's good thing or the salt level would've just been worse ... imagine a cheesesteak made with Beef Jerky and you'll have the right idea), whereas the (also heavily-salted) cheese amount was excessive, and the whole thing only had like 4 slices each of onion, bell pepper and mushroom.  Worst cheesesteak EVER, by a MILE.  They shouldn't even offer this item on their menu."}
{"text":"My pizza was the consistency and thickness of cardboard and burnt. Possibly the most unappetizing and disappointing pizza I've ever had the displeasure of eating. Won't be going back."}
{"text":"Dominos has really stepped up there game. Much better then I could remember a few years back. Their mobile app is really easy to use and tells you when the pizza is cooking, ready, and on its way which is nice when your hungry!! They also have the fastest delivery time. We ordered delivery tonight and it took less then 30min and received it hot and fresh.   The pizza was super good. Lots of cheese and sauce. We got a deal that came with a large pizza and 14 wings. The bone-in wings weren't good, tasted frozen and a little soggy so I won't order those next time. Overall I was happy though cause the pizza out weighed the bad wings.   Will order the pizza again. Thanks (:"}
{"text":"Get my Pizza here all the time.  It is a Domino's Pizza, hand tossed crust, etc. Great job, great value, great taste."}
{"text":"your driver Jonathan is a creep! that little freak decided to text our friend (who was visiting us and made the order) to complain about the tip he received. that's really rude and weird that he's using our order information in such a negative way. especially when this person knows where I live."}
{"text":"I ordered a barbecue chicken pizza add bacon, it was terrific and ready to pick up in 15 minutes on a Friday night. The pizza had a pan crust which isn't as heavy or greasy as Pizza Hut's.  Keep an eye out for online & app deals, through this weekend pizzas are 50% off."}
{"text":"Very happy with the service and the food is great! Very easy to order online...and you can even track the  progress!!  Love it"}
{"text":"Ordered at 1:25am and didn't receive my delivery until 2:45am. The place is only 1.4 miles from where we're staying and all I ordered was an Italian hoagie. I used to the tracker and said the driver left the store at 1:59am but I'm not sure what took so long. We actually fell asleep by the time the food came. Bummer"}
{"text":"This Dominos location has never disappointed us.  The freshness and quality of their pizza is always spot on- not to mention their customer service.  They are always quick to deliver and friendly at the door!"}
{"text":"Our new favorite chain pizza. Non greasy crust, decent quality amount and quality of toppings. I'm a big fan of the hand tossed crust- good flavor. Helpful and easy to use app and tracker. We carried out- staff was friendly. Good deal on carry out M-Th, a 3 topping large is just $8."}
{"text":"Food was good, typical domino's pizza.  The customer service was garbage.  No manners shown by the order taker or the delivery guy. Talked to Brittney the 'manager\" she was even worse. I would rather drive to pick my pizza next time then have to deal with that group of clowns."}
{"text":"Yo Domino's:  you guys make a nice pie nland best of the mass chains.  But please teach those kids to cut a pizza right.  Both of mine were butchered and then every slice gets ripped when you try to pick up a slice.  You can ruin a good pizza but not cutting it right."}
{"text":"'Pizza Artists'.....NOT!  Thought I would give them another try. Of course, I was completely disappointed again. Ordered 2 pizza's, 1 came Pie Cut and the other came Square Cut. WTF?? If I wanted a Square Cut, I would have ordered it that way, exactly why the applet is on the website to request it. Next, ordered White Sauce on one, and of course, it just came dry, with the toppings I asked for. I know you dont have to be any kind of genius to work a Minimum Wage job but enough with the 'Pizza Artist' Bullsh*t!!  There is a reason that you will never be Pizza Hut and/or Papa Johns, not that they are must better but it's now like comparing AA Baseball with MLB!"}
{"text":"Placed on order for delivery. An hour later I call to check on it. I'm told it's on the way. 15 minutes later I call back and it's been cancelled. No explanation. Ask if i want it remade and when i ask what the delivery time would be i was told 45 minutes."}
{"text":"After a long day at work, ain't nothing like dropping by and picking up a hot fresh pepperoni and jalapeño pizza  from the neighborhood \"Dominoes\".  It's clean and inviting. All the employees are respectful and courteous. Looks like I ain't cooking tonight."}
{"text":"Came in and decided to eat in. They have at least 5 workers and were the only one  around. Our order has been ready for 20 minutes sitting in on a heater lamp. No said anything all they do is talk about their exciting days off for \"EDC\" and do Drugs. Hope they start doing drug test around there."}
{"text":"Pretty impressed with the quality of the pizza from this location. Had to stop in for their limited time deal of $5.99 Large Two-Topping carry out only. It was ready quickly and the new self checkout kiosk is really convenient! Only downside is dominos started charging extra for packets of crushed red pepper?"}
{"text":"It's Dominos but it's good. Tried the meatlovers and enjoyed it. Good cheesy taste. I would get it again."}
{"text":"Put me on hold for 20 minutes to avoid doing their job. They just hope you hang up and go elsewhere to eat. Total joke of a business."}
{"text":"Made an order for my son's 6th birthday party to be delivered at 11:30 the next day. I did it the night before so somehow the order got set for 11:30pm. They noticed the mistake and we were able to work things out at noon ... All 8 pizzas were quickly put together and delivered by 12:35.   Near disaster turned into no big deal. Thanks Dominos!"}
{"text":"Horrible!!!!!  Got super bad service about a month ago  Literally got sent a pizza that had been sitting cooked for over 45 min!!!    A manager named Elijah called and promised stuff  Never received a credit or charge back   I tried to call and order a pizza right now On. Monday night at 9pm And the person taking the order told me its gonna be at least a 45 min wait before it can go out  I explain I recently had a problem and ask for the manager...she said Elijah wasn't in  I let them know id be calling back   I'm disabled..and on limited funds...  These POS losers need to quit so some hard working people can get the job  I'm sick of lazy losers!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I had one issue with a delivery driver from this store but the management handled it well. Otherwise, the service has been excellent. I would give it four stars if their delivery was faster and my food arrived hot which has not always been the case. It's somewhat understandable considering I'm a 10-minute drive away without stops but still.  The pizza is typical Domino's: not great but not bad either. It's a good go-to every once in a while when you don't feel like cooking."}
{"text":"Don't order here unless you want to wait for two hours & like your food cold. If you're in really bad luck they might also forget part of your order or get it wrong. I will never order from this place again."}
{"text":"Horrible service! This is the first time I have ordered delivery from this franchise and I am very disappointed. My boyfriend and I order two medium two topping pizzas along with wings over an hour ago. As we were waiting for our order we realized it was taking longer than we have expected as we check the Pizza Tracker we realized that it was stuck on \"quality check\" section for over 40 minutes! We finally called the business to see what the hold up was and we were put on hold for over 10 minutes before finally talking to someone who put us on hold again. Once we finally were able got talk to someone they read us back the wrong address AND they over looked out second pizza so the only reason they put pizza in the oven was due to the call we made, an hour and a half after we put in our order! The woman on the phone was also very rude and as we tried to ask questions on our order.  If you're planning on ordering from this Domino's just be aware that you will be waiting a very long time for you order and you may have to call to remind this business that you're still waiting on your order...."}
{"text":"Every time I have ordered here, the person delivering has been incredibly friendly HOWEVER, they always seem to forget something on the order, whether it's a drink or a sauce, they never seem to fail to forget SOMETHING.  I always order pasta and they could work on their presentation and the pasta is always a little dry but still good."}
{"text":"i have always enjoyed Domino's in the past.  now that i am in my new place i intend to continue with their service."}
{"text":"It is fun ordering your pizza online and watch what stages your order is at.  =)  I was too lazy to cook dinner and I just felt like pizza today.  I have not had Domino's in ages.  They commericals on TV got me thinking about their pizza (I guess it worked on me).    The ordered my pizzas online with the Tuesday coupon (Buy 1 large pizza and get 1 large free).  It is a good deal compared to the other coupons.  The pizza was here about 35 mins.  They looked good, smelled good, and tasted pretty good.  The toppings were kind of the light side."}
{"text":"I obviously can only give a Domino's a 3 star rating or else what would you think of me? but seriously Domino's is at least edible after decades of being part of the box it was delivered in. The cheese is stringy and tastes like real cheese, and the sauce actually tastes pretty good. Overall, I will at least consider Domino's for pizza when I want something quick and in a hurry."}
{"text":"We ordered a thin crispy pizza regular sauce, double mushrooms, green peppers, spinach,  onions, red peppers, less cheese well-baked. It was very good.  See pizza pic. Crisp, got our veggies for the day.  However, I can't say we even had edible proteins. See the second picture of BBQ chicken wings. If any of the wings were bigger than 2 1/2 inches, you could have fooled me... and my eating companion.  Looking forward to a good looking dessert of Cinna Stix. Bread was fine looking. But cinnamon was sparse except in one area. Cinna Stix 0 - customer 1. BBQ wings  -1 - customer 1, pizza - 3 - customer - 3.  Thanks Domino's.... I think."}
{"text":"I ordered delivery and was rather impressed. Worker on the phone took my order very kindly and ensured I had everything I asked for. Delivery guy was very quick. Surprised about the cost of the pizza, but it's Phoenix. Everything is priced high."}
{"text":"I received a terrible order of dried out or over microwaved food which was bad but what made it worse is twice I was called by John and offered to be provided with replacement order and they wanted to make it right only to try twice and have the rudest most disrespectful manager Allison do nothing to try and help. Bottom line terrible food and dishonest management"}
{"text":"Starving, watching tv, too late to go out...yup, Dominos is great! Quick delivery and nice hot pizza"}
{"text":"I ordered my usual, the delivery person was nice. I went inside, opened the box, and all the toppings and cheese were on one side of the crust. Like it had fallen on its side and left there.  Jumped in my car and took it to the store. The manager said \"5 minutes.\" That's all I got for my trouble. A replacement pizza. No apology, no gift card, nothing.  What rotten service."}
{"text":"These guys are great. What the heck are people expecting? LoL I'm in love with their Crunchy Thin Pizza crust... nom nom. Their Chocolate Lava Crunch Cake also rocks.  Seriously, it's solid pizza at a budget price... that delivers!!! Rate on what you're getting for the price you're giving.  Lighten up, people! See ya there!"}
{"text":"I recently switched to this location, because they always do a wonderful job; The dough is always proofed properly which is super important, the toppings are placed properly and not skimped, the pizzas are stretched properly (not a thin center), order is always ready in 15 or less, the pizza makers always give a warm welcome and are very friendly on and off the phones. If i were the GM or Owner i would be very proud of my team. Keep up the good word & thanks for making my dinner!   -AJ muzzi"}
{"text":"20 minute walk in wait. Better than expected from other user reviews. they're wings were full of drumsticks."}
{"text":"Filling our order this evening, failed miserably. When I received my ready to pick up prompt, I drove over. Only pizza was ready. I waited for wings. Wings came out with no hot sauce and no ranch (nor the extra we paid for). I opened the pizza and it was also incorrect. KJ provided great customer service, so I was not as upset anymore. I arrived home and the pizza was still wrong. First, the pizza had the garlic crust (we had ordered with no garlic). Second, we realized that instead of making a fresh pizza the cook decided to throw cold green peppers (which they had forgotten) and served as such. Needless to say our dinner was ruined. I have never experienced such a lack of concern for providing customer good service. Tonight this store failed to prove that Domino's is a company of exceptional people and definitely NOT the best pizza delivery company in the world. The disregard shown today is a health code violation in the making."}
{"text":"This place said they tried to call but actually didn't ; therefore I cancelled two large pizzas. I HIGHLY recommend paying with cash it's a wash whether you will get food here delivered. Good luck to those who need something at night"}
{"text":"Save your time and money .. frozen is even better than this. Dominos has always been bottom of the barrel...last ditch effort for late night munchies when no one else is open."}
{"text":"Worst experience ever with pizza. I ordered 3 pizzas and a sub sandwich yesterday. Two medium thin crust specials for $5.99 ea. and 1 medium pan. Had them delivered and opened the boxes and 2 were burnt to where the crust was completely black and no sauce or cheese ( not sure if it disintegrated from being over cooked or what happened). Very little toppings. The pan pizza had very little cheese. The driver short changed me $1.00 as well. What a waste of $35. We received something that resembled card board in a box."}
{"text":"Really wish crushed peppers were included with pizza. But I guess dominos would rather squeeze every dollar from their customers that just offer free peppers like every other pizza place in the world. The pizza war cooked to perfection along with garlic bites. I just can't get over the extra cost for crushed peppers."}
{"text":"We ordered our pizza online with a time quoted of 45-50 minutes for delivery. An hour went by, then 90 minutes. We checked online and it wasn't even in the oven. My husband tried calling, the automated hold voice babbled for 10 minutes. I called and got through to a human. They said it would be at least another 45 minutes till we got our pizza. Something was wrong with the website they said. No offer of compensation or acceleration of our delivery was made. We cancelled our order and ordered from Danny's with a quote of 35-40 minutes. Something isn't right with Dominoes."}
{"text":"These guys are usually pretty good about delivering me a pizza in a an appropriate amount of time and and with product usually great. These guys stay open pretty darn late , they were great but just like satisfactory great.         -simon"}
{"text":"Best dominos in Las Vegas. The staff are very helpful with getting you great deals and providing exceptional customer service every time.  Delivery typically takes 30 minutes, it arrives on time or early.  The pizza is always fresh and they don't skimp on the toppings.  This dominos has a dining area so you and your family, or friends can eat there.  Not all heroes wear capes!"}
{"text":"Ordered some pizzas today for work today and I have to say it was pretty delicious. We ordered their special which was 2 medium 3 topping pizzas , cheesy bread sticks and a 2 liter soda. We ordered the Hawaiian pizza with extra ham and a pepperoni with extra sausage. Both were awesome and very fresh. Everyone loved it. Not a bad deal either. Came out to be around $25 that included the tax , delivery and tip. They were really fast to deliver everything too! It took less than 30 minutes. The whole meal fed 6 of us easily. We were all full by the time we finished. Overall a great deal and experience. I will definitely recommend them to my friends and will order from them again ."}
{"text":"Not really sure what they do here, but apparently it isn't make or deliver pizza!  Twice in a row I have ordered and then waited hours for a delivery that simply never arrives. When I call a manager isn't available and my pizza is \"out for delivery.\"  This sucks. Spoke to Doug the GM last time this happened and he was apologetic and committed to it not happening again. Epic fail.   Order from Pizza Hut. They show up with your food."}
{"text":"Fantastic ordering a delivery that never arrives and then the store closes and you are just out of luck.   You suck Domino's! How hard is it to make and deliver a pizza? Isn't that what you do?  Called the next day to be left on perma-hold with their shit non-stop marketing.   Thanks but no thanks. I'll hut it from now on."}
{"text":"I love Dominoes! This pizza is such a great price for what your getting, it's not too greasy like Pizza Hut but it is flavourful and definitely not dry. Their online ordering system is great and I love the step by step tracking system. This location in particular is so fast and their staff are always really pleasant!"}
{"text":"I've ordered from this location many times. They have always been courteous and respectful to their customers. My orders have always been right. I recommend this place to anyone great pizza."}
{"text":"Called this location wanted to order the any two for 5.99 deal. This promotion gets advertised all over tv and online as well as in stores. I've ordered plenty of times from this location before and even checked online to make sure it is still valid. When getting my total associate stated it would be $29 and some change for my two medium two topping pizzas. I mentioned the deal they have and associate stated that deal ended yesterday and whatever promotions are online are no longer valid. I canceled my order, called a different store and associate stated the promotion is still valid paid $13 for two medium two topping pizzas instead of the $29 this location was trying to charge me."}
{"text":"I ordered a Pacific Veggie with double chicken and double cheese for take out. About 15 minutes later I received a call from the restaurant saying that they ran out of onions and if I still wanted the pizza. (No alternatives, just simply do you want it or not) Sure I'll still have it, no big deal. Appreciate the phone call. But once I got home I noticed that there DEFINITELY was not DOUBLE chicken NOR double cheese. And to top it off, my Pacific Veggie didn't even have ANY feta cheese on it. Disappointed that the meal I was craving, became a \"just eat it\" kind of meal. Very disappointed in my pizza. Usually very happy. Make sure to check your pizza before leaving."}
{"text":"So sad right now, everyone begged to order from a different pizza shop but I  really had my heart set on dominos. But when our order was delivered the plain cheese stuffed bread I ordered had bacon in it...No one eats meat here. Double, TRIPLE checked my order details and I definitely didn't order it by mistake either. Literally just threw away that $6 bread  Grossssssss."}
{"text":"Wife ordered a large order which included a chicken ranch sandwich, chicken alfredo pasta, and cheese sticks this past Friday evening 5/5/17 around 7pm.  The lady behind counter was very rude.  Didnt offer a bag to put all the food in, then when my wife politely asked for one, she rudely gave her a bag and didnt help her to put the food in."}
{"text":"I order from this particular Domino's at least once a week. They forget items that I've ordered about 75% of the time. Usually, marinara sauce or soda. Tonight, it took the driver 37 minutes to deliver my food even though the store is only 9 minutes away from my house. The driver forgot my soda and asked if I wanted him to bring it back or give me a credit. If I didn't want it with my food, I wouldn't have ordered it! I'm getting so fed up with this place that I'm seriously considering not ordering from them anymore. Pizza Hut has better crust anyway. SMH!"}
{"text":"Absolutely horrible service!! They have messed up our orders 3 times in a row now. The last order we put in was wrong again, so we called and asked for manager. A gal named Samantha was put on the phone claiming to be the manager. But her professionalism was anything but.. she just flat out was rude repeatedly to us, although we gave no reason. Maybe she was busy but that is no excuse to be rude. We will NEVER order from this dominos again, maybe from any. We've had called food and wrong orders but the rudeness of this so called manager is unacceptable. I really hope her superiors read this and proceed with action. I would never allow someone like this work for my company in a managers position."}
{"text":"it's domino's do you really need a bloody review? it's not better or worse than any of the other generic dominos in the city...same crust that tastes faintly of chlorine, chewy, flavorless cheese.  but you don't need to talk to anyone on the phone and you can track the order, so when you're half lit and need food, you're going to order from here regardless so why are you even wasting your time reading this?"}
{"text":"The best pizza ever made, good taste, fresh pizza I loved,best customer service, I ordered a chicken pizza hade the best taste ever people should definitely over here they would the service"}
{"text":"I haven't eaten pizza in over a year but I was dog sitting this weekend and had a craving for pizza so Dominos is the 2nd closest to my house (after Chizona on Macdonald-which is horrible) so I ordered online which was easy. I ordered at about 5:00 for a 5:45 pick up, one medium cheese pizza and some of those cheesy bread nub things. The online part was easy and that's where anything good I have to say about this place ends, well ok the pizza was decent too.   I arrived at the store to pick up my pizza, I was a few minutes early it was July 4th and all the delivery drivers had their vehicles in the parking spaces in the front so customers had to walk across the parking lot. So I go in, my order is not only not ready but they hadn't even started to make it. not one person making the food was wearing a hair net or plastic gloves, not even the girls (one a manager) who oath had hair at least 3inches beyond their shoulders. I am going to have to check but I think that is a healt code violation.  The first thing I am asked is how I am paying because their system was down and they could only take cash, which thankfully, I had.  So anyway, 15 minutes or so after I walked through the doors I was leaving and not one person apologized for the wait, instead they all stood around talking about which driver was next up, and some eating food -not sure if it was a customers orde or what, totally unprofessional.  Bad experience I won't be back."}
{"text":"Horrible experience, I received a cold pizza the first time I ordered- the manager promised a free pizza to make it up.  Called to redeem and rude employee basically called me a liar and wouldn't send the pizza.  Never go to this store!"}
{"text":"Usually a great location. We order from here a lot and I guess we have been spoiled in the past with super fast delivery. Today we are still waiting for the delivery. 60 to 70 minutes is not acceptable. Hopefully this is a fluke."}
{"text":"I ordered a large pizza through their website for pickup.  When I received it, it seemed smaller than expected. Their large is a 14\" pie. The total came to about $14.  Service was quick. It was ready in 15 minutes as stated online.  Pizza was okay. It would've been better with more toppings, there wasn't enough pineapple on it. The dough was a little under in some of the slices.  Likely won't order a \"large\" size again, ate the whole thing in one sitting!"}
{"text":"Pizza is always pretty good and timely. I order late night because I work nights. But this is the second time I've ordered chicken wings and they are 2 for 2 as the worst wings (hands down) that I've ever eaten. Fatty, soggy, barely able to calls themselves chicken...wings. If you're looking for \"food\" just order anything except the chicken wings. They make the least pickiest of eaters (me) want to ralph."}
{"text":"I mean, it's a chain with average pizza. But I was greeted quickly and walked through my options of best way to order pizza for me and my son. A/c was on and we waited just a few minutes for our pizza. They were generous with the toppings and very friendly. After working a long day they didn't even give me a hard time for asking for ham and sausage instead of ham and pineapple.   With all the pizza options in Sun Valley this location is doing well of meeting my expectations. Within 15 minutes I was on my way out the door, not bad as a walk in on a very busy night."}
{"text":"Employees who are taking orders over the phone could be nicer and be more informed of what they are selling.  Frustrated and had to hang up b4 I can place an order for delivery."}
{"text":"We ordered two pizzas to be delivered to our room. The customer service received when ordering was not up to par. Michael answered the phone rudely and was not very helpful. He hung up improperly and was not very willing to answer questions. We are not very familiar with Domino's Pizza and were visiting from out of town. We understand that the extremely hot weather was miserable for all but, professionalism must be maintained while performing a job."}
{"text":"I've been ordering from this store for years and I've never had any issues until this time. Extremely disappointed. My order was EXTREMELY late in arriving here & when it did arrive, the order was wrong, with missing items. After I called to see if they can resolve it, all they did was credit me for two sauces and that's it. Sad, sad customer service."}
{"text":"I prefer domino's over pizza hut for sure. Sometimes I crave it more than toppers. Its good for when you're feeling lazy and want some yummy pizza. Plus the parmesan bites are delicious."}
{"text":"My daughter was craving pizza. I ordered the thick crust. Made the mistake of not checking it before I left. It was thin crust. NEVER buy the thin crust. It was like they through a few ingredients and saltine crackers. Two mediums with two toppings for $12. Total ripoff. Hardly any toppings. In fact if I took the toppings from both pizzas it may have added up to one topping. Just horrible. The owner or manager is obviously cutting back to save money. If thet yhad a bar, they would be watering down the booze."}
{"text":"got some of the worst food poisoning i've ever had from here last night.   literally throwing up all night be what i didn't throw up, well, you can guess how it came out.  will never eat dominos again"}
{"text":"Perfect for meetings where you need easy food.  Ordered Pizza online twice now with delayed delivery to suit my schedule.  No problem each time.  Pizza made correctly and  delivered on time.  Is it the best pizza--nope.  Easy to order, convenient, reliable, customizable--absolutely.  Sometime ease of convenience is worth more than taste.  Try getting fast delivery  or the correct order from the \"better pizza\" places.  I think not."}
{"text":"RECOMMENDED:  Domino's new improved pizza is much better than their previous pizza.  Everything tastes better starting with  their improved zesty crust.  Their $5.99 for 2 large 2 topping carry out pizzas are a pretty good deal.  The location is neatly tucked away in the AJ's shopping center at Pima Rd & Pinnacle Peak.   Staff is pretty nice, as they greeted me from the kitchen. I was pleasantly surprised that they are super fast to have pizzas ready for carry out.  They no longer will give you packets of parmesan cheese.  Instead they will sell you a packet of parmesan cheese.  I don't think they offer crushed red pepper packets either.  Whatever works Domino's."}
{"text":"i've been waiting over 2 hours for this delivery. fast food/delivery is all about convenience & speed. if i knew i'd be waiting this long i would have gone out to dinner & spent my money elsewhere. even called talked to someone named \"marco\" who was absolutely rude & told me he would talk to a manager, & had to hold for 5 minutes just for MARCO to tell me my order has been cancelled. no refund no apology. i'm pretty easy to please but i am appalled by the lack of customer service & all around terrible management & problem solving from everyone there that i've spoken to tonight. never giving this franchise my money again."}
{"text":"Since I have moved, Domino's seems to have become my go-to pizza joint. It 's fast and easy. Plus you can get a large with unlimited toppings for a cheap price and not have to live across the border like Pizza Hut's any size pizza, any toppings for $10. I can get almost the same at Domino's for $12."}
{"text":"Completely awful workers, placed an order online and it said it was getting prepped at 11:09 I give them 15 min before I leave to go pick it up. I arrive and am told it's going to be another 25 min. Prior to ordering online, I tried calling in my order and the phone rang for 9 min. Now I'm sitting here waiting for my pizza and the phones are ringing none stop so I now know why no one picked up because they think since they are short staffed it's okay to not take business. Definitely not a good place for a quick lunch. They say they are hiring all positions and are short staffed but this is ridiculous.  It's now 11:47 and still no pizza."}
{"text":"Great pizzas, they have a new salad that's really good. Highly recommend it for fast friendly service."}
{"text":"The driver kicked my 13 cat back inside because he was worried it was running away instead of greating all guests like she does. 5 days later, still no call back from Dominononono. Just dont order. They could careless as long as they get your money."}
{"text":"Okay- I got sucked in by the TV commercial that said how Dominos had changed ingredients to change customer opinion.  That along with a friend telling me that it was good pizza made me try it.  I will not stray from Romeo's again.  Dominos had a cool app that worked and a price of $7.99 for a large three toping pizza but the pizza- not so good.  The only part of it that was enjoyable was the crust because it tasted like it had been coated with garlic butter.  The sauce and pepperoni was lacking in flavor.  Not sure what I will do with the leftovers- maybe cut the crust off and throw away the rest!  Is that worth $7.99?  NO. I will say that the app was really very good.  I order through it and it showed me when the pizza was made, when it was in the oven and when it was ready for pick up.  Too bad the pizza was not as good as the app."}
{"text":"I ordered a large hand tossed pizza with pepperoni, a 2 liter, 16 Parmesan bites that came with a marinara sauce, and 14 wings online. The store called me & said they didn't deliver to apartment complexes after a certain time. So I changed it to carry out. They transferred my order and changed my payment. I went to the location and hurried to pick up my order but got home and my pizza had no pepperoni on it, I didn't have my marinara sauce or my 2 liter soda. They mess up my order everytime I order from here. Don't think I'll be ordering here again!"}
{"text":"This location, has never gotten an order wrong, is always prompt, and very polite.  I cannot say a single thing bad about them.  I have had terrible experiences with Domino's Pizza stores in the past and this one is 180 degrees in the right direction.  They are super fast, also... the estimated time is always blown away!  I use the online ordering system but should I have a problem after placing the order they never get an attitude or sound haughty about it... you can hear them smile and do whatever it is you need.  I would recommed this location to anyone.  Also the new improved pizzas and sauces, etc makes Domino's my favorite.  I even used to order Dominos when I was overseas!  Thank you so much!"}
{"text":"Domino's online site was so much easier to navigate compared to Papa John's.  Was impressed.  Thanks Painesville Domino's!"}
{"text":"I order from this location whenever we get pizza. I am on a gluten free diet, and Domino's has the best GF pizza out there (oddly enough). I always order online, so I am not familiar with the phone service that others have complained about. Online ordering is a breeze and I have never had any issues. Typically I do carryout, and the staff is friendly when I go in. When I do get delivery it always arrives fast and hot. For a chain pizza place this is one of the better options for me and I have no problems with this location."}
{"text":"I was iffy about using this Domino's because of the other reviews but decided to go with it instead because it is closest to my home for delivery. I placed my order and it said it would be delivered in 26-36 minutes for one small pizza and one medium pizza. Much to my surprise, we got our order in 20 minutes. Talk about a fresh pizza! Everything was exactly how it was ordered and tasted great. Our delivery girl was especially nice and thanked us multiple times!"}
{"text":"Have to say they're fast ... The delivery guy was very nice  Will buy from them always when we want good pizza..........................."}
{"text":"Pathetic service!!! They send you  an email detailing the order and even give a delivery time-frame, which they miss.  I live 7 minutes from the location,and according to their tracking system the pizzas sat in the shop or 14 minutes prior to leaving for delivery and then it took the driver another 20 to get to the house.  Save yourself the anguish by ordering from either Pizza Hut across the street from this location or Papa Johns  a few blocks east on Thomas Rd."}
{"text":"I was hesitant to write this review; do I want people to know what I really think of dominos? Will they judge me? But then I decided it was best I let the cat out of the bag ...... Dominos is pretty good.  Its a franchise, so I can only reference  the niagara street  location. I ordered delivery for the first time, and was kinda surprised    We tried the \"Brooklyn style\" pizza, which is essentially a really tasty thin crust pizza.   We were brave and also got an order of BBQ wings. They were tender and had a good amount of meat on the bone - a bit fatty, alas, they were good.  We opted for a deal that included the CinneStix .... And yeah, those things are like crack. Theyre sooooo yummy.  The food arrived quickly (25 min), and they accepted debit at the door.  I will definitely be passing on Pizza Pizza next time, as I have a new 'quick pizza' fav! Dominos has won me over."}
{"text":"I ordered 2 pizzas with 3 toppings each, per the coupon I had online. I ordered pepperoni, sausage olive for my daughter. It did not come with olives on it....she cried, toddler tantrum! I called to notify. The woman said \"oh sorry\" and nothing more. Then I noticed we didn't receive the bleu cheese I bought for the parmesan bites...so, I called again. She said \"what do you want me to do for you?\" Appalled!  The customer service sure lacked when the company had made mistakes to my order. In the end, I did get both of what I needed, but that is what I ordered and did not deserve the comments/ customer service I barely received! This is surely a first for me!"}
{"text":"Went to pick up my pizza the other day.  While waiting I saw an employee (a driver I think but not sure) go over to the stand where the hot pizzas were waiting for pickup or delivery, and where nobody could see him.  He opened a pizza box, picked some pieces off the pizza and ate them!  Then he closed the box back up.  Gross, right?  That could have been my pizza, which was on the same stand."}
{"text":"Man we love dominos but the last 2 times t was bunt..the subs and pizza ...they were fresh ...but mannn come on..   Update orderd again today and it was fire fresh as can be driver was nice and happy..."}
{"text":"The WORST possible customer service I have ever encountered, and my expectations are lowered due to the shitty food they serve, so that says a lot.   First off, Justin \"the manager\" needs some serious training. They must be desperate to put this guy in charge. Your attitude is not appreciated and certainly not necessary.   Had received a completely burnt cold pizza a few weeks back, along with being a good 30 min past the time it said it was going to be delivered. So I called the store and they said they would put a credit on my account under my phone number. Well fast forward a few weeks later and I am calling to use that credit and \"manager\" Justin can't find any credit under my account  I proceeded to say, well, you guys were suppose to put the credit on, and he says \"sorry, can't do anything about it without notations on the account\"  Well no shit Justin, that's what I'm telling you, obviously someone should have put a notation on the account when they didn't.  Did he remedy the situation? Of course not, he gave me attitude and said he can't do anything about it. Great manager . I don't know if this is all Dominos stores policy to treat customers like they don't want or care about their business, but this one on warner loop I have constantly had issues with. Do yourself a favor and eat elsewhere."}
{"text":"Awesome location!  The pizza and bread sticks are as awesome as you expect from Dominos.  It's the people that make this store awesome.  My PC screwed up two different ways and I still got my hot delicious food and awesome service!  Give these dudes a raise.  Stat!"}
{"text":"Before you ask, yes I always wear aviators.  But this isn't about wearing sunglasses in bathrooms.  This is about my local Domino's pizza.  I'm from new York and am really picky about my pizza, so Domino's is obviously a no-brainer.  Authentic style ingredients is what I'm talking about.  Perfect crust, and just the right amount of cheese, fuggetaboudit. Domino's makes me feel like I'm in the big Apple all over again."}
{"text":"I legit have no words. Why did my pizza look like it was involved in a car crash?! Never again."}
{"text":"I always order online for delivery and they always get my order correct. Today I ordered for carry out. When I got there they had people waiting. I had put in my order and paid already so I was just there to pick up. The delivery driver helped me. He was so so nice and had a huge smile on his face. I am a store manager in the restaurant business myself and he has all the qualities of a wonderful employee. I didn't catch his name but he was amazing. Thanks guys keep up the great work."}
{"text":"Ordered through the app on my iPhone. That was awesome, and easy to use. Ordered their pasta bowl! It was ready in the time that was stated. Staff is friendly enough! I love the pasta bowl, they are awesome! Not complaints and I like this location."}
{"text":"Used to be a good store.. Up until a couple of months ago, this store was awesome. Twice now their system has been down, but they knew what my order was.. Ummm, I'm confused!! How do you think we ordered pizza back in the day? Also, a couple of weeks ago it took two hours and it was ice cold. Never received a response from the store manager. .Will never order from Dominos again!!"}
{"text":"Great pizza when I'm in a hurry or have friends over.   A special shout out to my usual delivery guy Nick. He delivers to my house super fast and is always friendly. That really makes a difference."}
{"text":"I love pizza! In fact, thanks to mint.com I discovered that I consistently spend more money buying pizza than I do on groceries per month. Needless to say, I've decided to embrace that fact.  I've probably ordered from this specific location at least 50 times since moving here in July 2013. I'm surprised at the lower reviews. As far as I've seen, they're always on their A-game. The delivery is super fast (think 20-30 minutes), and it doesn't hurt that I LOVE their website. Corporate does a lot of things right to set its stores up for success, and it shows with flying colors on Camelback.   Thanks for the awesome, reliable pizza guys!"}
{"text":"Ordered delivery an hour ago, still waiting. Called the store, told \"we have multiple deliveries in the neighborhood\"."}
{"text":"Dominos is usually my go to place for order out pizza delivery. Love the coupons, love the new bread twists, love the new pan pizza. For those reasons they earned some stars. The last two times, however, they delivered incomplete orders. First time missing the dipping sauces,  second time missing the drinks. So I get to eat pizza with some tap water while I wait for them to re deliver the drinks.  When I called to let them know they forgot the drinks, the first thing they said was , \"want a refund?\" I would expect a refund AND delivery of the drinks I ordered. Not so much. May or may not order from here in the future. I'll update my review if I do."}
{"text":"Just ordered a pizza at midnight i called it in the employee that answered said it would be an hour before i could get a pizza i could tell they didn't want to deliver so i asked for the manager. He answered and said the same excuse so i hung up and ordered online and it was here in 34 minutes. The pizza was a mess, all the cheese and toppings shifted to 1 side of the pizza and it was a mess. The pizza was cut all messed up as well. Very vwry disappointed, next time i will order papa johns."}
{"text":"I do no go to Domino's Pizza at all. So therefore when I walk in and don't know the toppings and the young man at the cashier tells me, \"well if you slow down and read them.\" So I asked him \"you don't know what toppings you offer?\" He then proceeds to be snark and say \"I will read them for you if you want.\" Serious customer service fail. How rude! Since I don't go to Domino's I had no idea the were written on the counter in front of me. I have no idea where he got the notion that he has the right or that I gave him permission to speak to me like that. Epic fail, hello yelp."}
{"text":"Ordered a pizza for Sunday night football at 4:30pm. At 7pm when nothing arrived I tried to call the store and ask about my delivery. After being on hold for 20 minutes listening to the recording insist that I hang up and order online, I decided to go ahead and take my concern online like they asked.    Get it together dominoes."}
{"text":"My boyfriend got them last night, but he woke up early this morning throwing up from them."}
{"text":"I only order off of their coupons menu as they always have some pretty good specials. I usually pick up the orders as they are just a block up the road. When they deliver it takes forever.   I got 2 pizzas and wings, the pizzas were pretty good so I couldn't really complain. But the hot wings were disgusting! I mean they were dry and the flavoring was just horrible. You get better wings at Pizza Hut. Pizza is good but never get the wings from here they just don't taste right."}
{"text":"Wow, never will I order from Dominos again. The employees are all in a bad mood, some guy shouting from the back and peppers and cheese now costs \"$1 and something for a small packet\". Thanks!"}
{"text":"Last Saturday I ordered from this location and my entire order was wrong.  So I called them and they were so nice! The young man working corrected  my order quickly and rushed it since it was delivery. I appreciate the awesome service!!  I have ordered from this store a thousand times so I understand mistakes happen but when they take care of you so well it should be noted and recognized! Keep up the great work Dominos's!!"}
{"text":"I normally don't order from Domino's due to lack of creativity but accounting for the time I needed a pizza delivered on a Sunday night; it was the only store open.   Ordering the pizza online could not be any easier but when the pizza came to my door the delivery guy gave me a receipt that was not only more than what I paid for, it was the wrong receipt. Obviously I used my card online so he needed a signature and he made me sign the receipt that wasn't mine. It was late, he probably had a long day so it wasn't that big of a deal. I ended up tipping the guy anyway.   The pizza that was delivered were prepared horribly! One pizza was overly cooked and had almost no cheese at all. The other pizza had a fair amount of cheese but the crust WAS NOT thoroughly cooked. It was a huge let down and definitely made up my mind to stay away from Dominos. :/"}
{"text":"Been ordering from this location for 6 years now and have never had a problem. My kids love pizza so a pickup on the way home or delivery happens at least twice a week. Ordering on line or on the phone is always easy, any time I have had a problem the manager has fixed it asap. Even with new faces every week they run a tight ship. And it makes my kids happy so I'm happy."}
{"text":"This Dominos Pizza is located at Ninth Line and Hwy 7, a small pizza place, clean. Lots of parking and the usual staff member there has a great memory and is very polite.  I generally almost always try and order from dominos whenever they have their 50% off specials and they never disappoint. It's made on time at this location, they don't skim on toppings and it tastes AMAZING.  If you love Dominos this is the place to go to. It's not near me but for the customer service and the quality, it's worth the trip!  4.5/5!"}
{"text":"This dominos never disappoints. Always amazing fresh, lots of toppings added and once they forgot to give me a dipping sauce - I was like whatever... the next day, they called me and offered me a $10 credit. I didn't expect them to do that but customer service and the customer is definitely something they care about!  This means that management is on top of their game here. Always my go to Dominos!  Whether walk in or delivery!!!  4.5/5"}
{"text":"Personally I've had my bad experiences here before where there was staff yelling at each other behind the counter and the rest of the crew just keeps to themselves. Especially when it was a manager belittling a cashier who was not competent enough to take orders which could possibly have been a new employee who needed guidance. On top of that, I was charged a lot for them to make mistakes on my order. Shows how smart I was to trust that they would get the job right until I got home to find out I was missing some key items. I should've double checked before I left.   Today, it was a whole different staff on shift and they were actually pleasing to have when ordering pizza. They were fast and efficiently functioning as a crew to get my order done. When it was ready for pick up, the cashier personally made sure I checked to see if my orders were accurate before I left."}
{"text":"The pizza here is a hit or miss, but when done right, it's a good location for a pizza deal. The only real problems I've had here are with the delivery drivers. I've had some of my worst experiences at Domino's. Just a heads up for potentially rude employees. (But just like other comments I've seen on here, Thomas is an EXCELLENT worker- I just wish I always had him!)"}
{"text":"We placed the order on the Domino's app. We ordered 4 custom pizzas. The order came to our door in 15 minutes! We're about 10 minutes from the store so I don't know how they did it (all green lights??) The order was exactly as we ordered it - all 4 custom pizzas were as ordered. But the best part is that they deliver when it is 114 degrees outside!!"}
{"text":"Every time I have ordered pizza from their website. It has been exactly how I wanted it. The delivery people have been polite an friendly."}
{"text":"I've had takeout pizza before, and this spot makes some pretty good pizza. When they have a deal, you can get some good pizza for the same price of some much cheaper places. The amount of toppings you can get is crazy too. I think we found a new local fast food pizza spot."}
{"text":"garbage...   customer service is wack and rude... and two stores tell us they don't deliver it near don mills and Sheppard... which I find so fukked cause it should be in the radius of their delivery service...   pizza is good(rare)... depends on the stores we delivered it from but most of the time it's burned...and the toppings on the pizza is only a little bit on it.. (like they're going into a recession or just being plain cheap to customers)   think twice in ordering their pizza..."}
{"text":"Since the Del Webb location took over delivering to our area from the Durango location it SUCKS. We can watch them leave the store on the tracker and it always takes them over 30 minutes to get to our house so by the time the pizza comes it is always COLD. We only live 12 minutes from them we are further from Durango and they always had our pizza delivered in 15 minutes and still hot. Will not order from them again."}
{"text":"OK OK... as a Proud Italian I hope my momma don't see this! I'm actually going to give D'moes a 5 star rating for a few reasons. Last Friday, me and my 2 brothers left the suns game, and proceed to put a few \"adult\" beverages back. At around 2am, when Haney's shut down, we had an overwhelming craving for crap pizza (its better than our normal Jack in Box at 3am run that usually ends up with someone puking in the drive thru line because the smell of the taco sauce is so amazing). Low and behold, the ONLY spot that was still taking orders (up to 2am!) was D'moes. Now, 1st off - I live at Summitt (by BOB). These guys gladly delivered to me, all the way down there! Major props for that. 2 - They understood me... considering I don't remember ordering the pizza (I woke up to pizza and wings boxes all over my pad, and me saying \"who ordered pizza\" then I burped... wing sauce and vodka is a healthy combo. 3 - apparently, after checking my voice mail, the driver was pounding on our door for about 5 minutes (we were REALLY jamming out to Rock Band, in case you don't know, were pretty awesome. Wikipedia that Ish ladies and Gent's; Kansas City Bullriders). Well, the driver and my door man both called 3 times. I'm assuming the driver eventually came in and grabbed the bass guitar and strummed it out. Maybe he had a slice with us? Who really knows these things. However, I do know that I was insanely impressed with D'moes... from the left overs I ate the next when I could remember. It was pretty darn good. Between the awesome'ness that is called \"their customer service\" and the legit taste it left in my mouth, I'm a believer, unless, if I say I'm not, will I get a commercial?... hmmmm.... Potential there...."}
{"text":"Ordered a medium thin crust pizza and stuffed cheesy bread with 2 marinara sauce sides last night. The delivery took longer than expected, the pizza was cold (not cool, cold), they forgot both the marinara, and the cheesy bread was a little done.   Really disappointing considering we order from here very often."}
{"text":"Okay....so since my initial review and earlier positive experience, I've returned for other visits and have to say....I'm doing a complete turn around on this one. Since my first few orders that were stellar, I've ordered again and it's been awful every time. Not just bad, TERRIBLE. The pizzas are dry, like Sahara desert dry. The toppings are practically non-existent and the sauce is even dry which I never thought possible.   Today I ordered two pies. I was only going to order one, but I didn't think that was enough for delivery so I got two since it was 1/2 price Monday's and I was feeling too lazy to go out for pho, which had been my initial inclination. I should have gone for pho. Both pies were extremely dry and looked like they'd spent a lot more than 6 minutes out of the oven (this is what Dominos pizza tracker told me had elapsed since the pies were done cooking). I had ordered extra cheese on both, I didn't see any extra cheese, in fact, I didn't see much cheese at all. The crust was dry, the pizzas looked and tasted old. Since I had kept track of the time since I'd ordered and it wasn't too long, I'll just chalk the old leathery pizza appearance up to bad quality. The total was still $29 on a 1/2 price day. It was disgusting. I'd have called back, but I've had enough bad pizzas from Domino's now to know that I won't be ordering from them again.  Stay away"}
{"text":"Always have issues with this Dominos. Quality is never good. Food is overly greasy and taste like grease to the point that you cannot even eat it. Grease should not soak through the box enough to make it drip..."}
{"text":"I was craving delivery food and was checking for good deals in the area and i saw the 5 topping large pizza promo and pop so i placed an order and wow! it can only be said the last time was an accident or something but today's delivery was steaming hot, thin crust crunchy pure deliciousness and yes I am super picky with pizza if you can't get the thin crusr well done concept down you lose my business! had it delivered to my house thru a mobile app order and. the delivery guy was super nice and polite as well!!  Well done Domino's!! i am a fan again!"}
{"text":"This location only got 1 Star because there is no option for ZERO.  I ordered a pizza and was given an ETA of 35-45 minutes.  At 50 minutes I called to find out where my pizza was, no answer.  Now they are closed, I do not have my pizza, but my card has been charged.  This pizza was being ordered for my sons as they have friends staying the night, n now I have a house full of hungry boys with no food.  Looks like a drive thru night at McDonalds to spend more money, and FURIOUS doesn't describe my sentiments.   I will be taking this issue up the corporate ladder as this is COMPLETELY UNACCEPTABLE!"}
{"text":"PIZZA IS PIZZA....well Pizza is my favorite food, and it's not the case, I like my pizzas a certain way, depending on where I'm getting the pizza, I see people giving reviews on take out pizzas, and honestly, if you order pizza, get it within 20 minutes, and it tastes good, what else do you want, the service at take out pizza places sometimes is not the best, well it's because they are super busy, at dominos I always order thin crust pizzas, and cheesy bread, it's always good, same, consistent and great prices!"}
{"text":"Same food as any other Domino's but ridiculously uncoordinated. The kitchen floor is pure chaos and they spent more time trying to figure out who ordered what and arguing about pending orders than they do actually making food. There will often be someone out on the sidewalk advertising cheap pizza but don't trust any time estimates given by the staff if you walk in in person; add at least 10-20 more minutes."}
{"text":"Ordered online at 915.  At 0950 the tracker said my order was here.   At 1010 I called the store and they said they would have it to me in 10 minutes.  At 1035 when my order still hadn't arrived I called back again and asked about it.   I was then told that we would have to come to the store and pick it up, that they couldn't tell me anything other than that."}
{"text":"Are you faggots really that busy you can't answer the phone for 20 minutes at midnight. Always horrible fuck this place"}
{"text":"I'm not a huge fan of chain restaurants. But, we were helping friends move and I decided to pick up pizza and beer on the way.  The place was clean and the staff was friendly.  I didn't wait long for my pizza's. I had ordered a head and got 4 large pizza's with everything on them. When I arrived at my destination the pizza's looked like they had been through a car accident. I didn't bump or move them. They were placed in my back seat and didn't move.  Two of the four were literally on top of th box, it looked like they had been dropped. We didn't eat those two. The other two were okay. They tasted like your basic frozen dough and cheap toppings.  I won't be returning."}
{"text":"After long day at work I was driving up home from work and I was stuck in traffic. So I decided that let's make it a pizza night. I was near this location so I figured let me order a pizza for carry out.   I call the number and the first thing I hear is the automated special. A lady answers the phone in very sad tone, I asked do you guys have any special for Large pizza? That's when she tells me about three toppings large for $7.99. So I order it and I was told it will be ready in fifteen minutes.   I get to the store in about ten minutes and when I get in I notice that they really don't have any seating area other than two bench to wait so it's really a pick up location. I get to the counter and a girl says \"what's the name\" I was expecting more like \"Hey welcome to Domino's how can I help\"? but I guess it didn't happen. She looked up in the computer and said it will be $8 and some change so I hand in my plastic. I sign it  and I need to wait few mins which I expected because I was told fifteen minutes and I got there in ten. While I waited, I noticed that this location was well staffed compare to the amount of order they were getting in or people coming to pick up.   Through out all the interaction, there was no smile nor any courtsy from any other employee. When my pizza was ready, I was called in by my name and I checked my order to make sure it was veg pizza before I drive off.   I didn't even get an offer to get peppers, napkins not even buy any additional souce.  Again, I didn't get have a nice day or thanks for stopping by."}
{"text":"Usually don't have issues with dominoes but this one really screwed me over today. I made an order around 10-11 am to have it at my place for 1215. They call me around 12 saying it'll be there at 1230 but I already have 40 hungry kids waiting for the pizza to arrive and by 1245 still nothing came. I called the dominos and they said the driver left a minute ago. They talked to their manager and said we only had to pay delivery fee but by the time the delivery guy got there at 1:05 they said they were only giving me two pizzas free. Not really impressed by the whole day and I got in a lot of shit for the whole ordeal because it screwed over all the plans for the whole day. Hopefully you don't have the same experience because dominos is usually not that bad but today sucked for this dominos."}
{"text":"What you would expect from a dominos pizza. Pizza was made precisely to how I ordered. What made this 5 star service was the fact the employee came and opened the door for me as he saw I had my son in his carrier. He then opened the door for me again as I left after I paid. It's the small things."}
{"text":"Haven't eaten Domino's in years, I must say they have definitely stepped up their game in the pizza market. I've eaten pizza in Chicago and New York and I must say this is a very good pizza. Ordered the thin crust pepperoni and mushroom pie and it was awesome. Crust was light and crispy, cheese was perfect and there was an excellent amount of pepperoni and mushroom covering the pizza."}
{"text":"I ordered 3 large pizzas and employees were very nice when I picked up the pizzas. However when I got home very hungry one of the pizzas had no cheese in the middle of the pizza and the other pizza was missing cheese in a few spots on the pizza. Not a good situation when you are hungry but called Dominos and said they would remake the pizzas or give us a refund. I was not pleased how the pizzas turned out however I give them credit on how they handled the situation. Therefore instead of 2 stars I gave them 3 stars. I will try them again because they made it right for me."}
{"text":"Delivery is friendly and quick. The table is clean, so if you HAD to eat here, you could.  I think they started out as a cheap for the value delivery place and it's caught up with them,  and they can't shake the image they created because their pizza is always mediocre.  The worst thing is that there is a PJ right across the street, so when I'm out, I never want to come here."}
{"text":"I would leave this place zero stars if I could. I'm so disappointed. I am in town overnight, and decided to order a pizza from this place. They let me know it would be about 1 hour 15 min (they are 20 minutes away). Since we were hungry and other places were closing, we agreed. Fast forward almost two hours later, we call and are told the delivery person hasn't even left the store! Even better, we were told the driver has 4 other orders that may be delivered before ours. Wth!  Mind you its now midnight and we have to leave the hotel super early am to catch a flight.  I'm so disappointed, I cancelled the order. I definitely would've ordered from somewhere else had I known. Smh major fail"}
{"text":"For being Dominos, it wasn't bad. Got a pepperoni and extra cheese. I'm glad I ordered extra cheese because if I didn't, there may not have been any cheese on it at all. Plus the crust is too chewy. I'm not sure if the dough comes in frozen or not, but it's definitely not made in store, just like all of the other chains. Dominos pizza overall is nasty. But this particular one made the pizza as best they are able to. What does one expect for a 14\" pizza for $7.99?"}
{"text":"I order from here often and have never had a problem until a couple nights ago.  I ordered my pizza and waited over 1 1/2 hrs for it to arrive.  I called and talked to a woman who was very rude. I had asked her if there was an update on my order since the app tracker let me know that it has been \"quality checking\" for about 45min.  She said my order was next in line and hung up on me.  I then waited another 45min for it to arrive.  When the driver pulled into the driveway he sat in his car for about 10min and then walked slowly to the door.  When I opened the door there was no apology or sincerity, he simply gave me my pizza, said \"Thanks\" and walked off.   I'm guessing they had a bad night, so I'm not trading my preferred store for another location, but this was not ok."}
{"text":"Good store! Good people. I like that they have plenty of employees working at one time. Although, I have seen several employees there who smoke and then walk in the back and not wash their hands. Gross!!"}
{"text":"This was such a sad experience. I used to like Dominos a lot. Since there \"new pizza\" has come along, I will not order again. My boyfriend who will eat almost anything...especially pizza, stopped after 1 piece and said it was disgusting. He HATED the cornmeal all over the bottom of the pizza. He said that it was gross and annoying having it all over his hands while he ate. He also did not like the garlic crust. I like the flavors of the crust because they taste like their breadsticks, but did not like having to touch it the whole time I was eating the pizza. The cheese was sparce, and the pizza way dry. I babysit a little girl all the time, and Dominos was her favorite, and now she won't eat it at all. I also think that it was rude how they put \"Papa Johns, now who's your Daddy\" on our pizza box. First of all, Papa Johns is my favorite fast food pizza. I think it's funny that Dominos has had to copy them with garlic sauce, and now they are trying to claim that their new pizza is better. yeah right. Dream on Dominos! Never again!"}
{"text":"Cardboard topped with sugary pizza sauce and butter slathered on the crust.  The entire thing just tastes fake.  Sorry not edible!"}
{"text":"The handmade pan pizzas are the best thing on the menu.  Delivery is extremely fast.  The reason I didn't give them 5 stars is because the chicken (side items) is always dry.  We order at least once a month.  Delivery is always under 30 minutes."}
{"text":"horrible service their app allowed me to place the order for delivery -  after setting up everything and placing order  I get a call they do not deliver  to my address I would need to call another store to pace order.  what a crock      -  they need to fix their apps"}
{"text":"Who the heck is taking orders on the phone? This guy is so slow and has very little knowledge of the products he's selling. Every item I asked for, I was put on hold so he could ask someone else about it. I hope my food is better than my overvthe phone experience."}
{"text":"Good pizza. Delivery people are always nice and the people that work there if you order for pick up are always friendly."}
{"text":"We ordered from this shop for my 3 year old son's birthday party. We provided very little notice and they delivered our pizzas on time and the order was accurate. The pizza is mediocre, but they do what they do well, so that's worth 3 stars in my book."}
{"text":"pizza was so delicious far best from the latest competitors, Pizza was done in time as done on line, nice and hot. Service was nice and fast."}
{"text":"Wow, this my  was first time I place an online order this store is quick Ryan was very nice I would highly recommend this to anyone..."}
{"text":"Very bad services charges for ranch and manger sitting there doing nothing really I had to wait ten minutes for my order"}
{"text":"I always have a problem with this location I order a pizza need to order more, but the person on the food was trying to argue with me and hung up I will not be eating at this location again"}
{"text":"Horrible place to order pizza I place a 49 dollar order and it wasn't ready the gm was trying to aruge with me be ware don't order here"}
{"text":"The pacific veggie is epic. Order it with extra cheese and you will not be dissapointed. The pick up special M-Thursday for large pizza carryout is a steal of a deal. Very tasty for a corporate chain and pricing is very good.  Best online system for ordering as well."}
{"text":"They delivered a pizza with just sauce when we wanted cheese pizza. What got me upset was we had to pay them for another deliver WTH it wasn't our fault they made a mistake so we had to go back and get our cheese pizza. Won't be using this dominos again"}
{"text":"TERRIBLE EXPERIENCE!!!! Worst experience I've ever had with a food delivery and driver. I'm out of town on business and ordered delivery to my hotel room. The rooms are outside doors with an open parking lot. The delivery driver calls and states she will not bring my order to my room, I have to go pick it up from the lobby. The way the hotel is set up the lobby is extremely far from my room, (all one level and very spread out) about a 5 to 8 min walk in the dark alone. I told the driver that and said I've never had dominos do that to me, she said it was corporate policy. I call the store manager and explain I'm in my robe and not walking the distance in the dark, I wouldn't have ordered delivery if I had to go pick it up. He said he'll call the driver. The driver then calls me screaming and cussing demanding I go pick up my food from her because she will not go to my room. Wow. The manager simply just said he's sorry?!?! Best believe that I called corporate. The manager and driver provided the worst dominos experience I've ever had and another restaurant got my business because of it. The driver should be fired!"}
{"text":"Ordered online because I had a coupon that was sent in the mail... ordered a pizza and bread twists with marinara sauce...   NO marinara sauce in box !!!   Other wise ...delivery driver was nice, food was hot and didn't take that long... I would of really liked to have my marinara sauce though"}
{"text":"This restaurant didn't have my order ready when I went over because they gave my pizza I ordered online to a customer who walked in and got the same pizza. They made me wait about 15 minutes to get a new pizza. My experience was ok at the end of the day because they let me have a free dipping for the wait. On the positive side, my pizza was very delicious and fresh!"}
{"text":"This is an EXCELLENT Domino's store delivering a tasty product; in a timely manner.  While visiting Phoenix, I've ordered delivery from this store several times over the past few months. This Domino's is located about 4 miles from where I am staying. Month after month, this store delivered all Internet orders exactly as ordered and within about 30 to 40 minutes after pressing the enter key on the keyboard.  Plus, you can track the order on-line to know when the product left the store.  The pizzas have always arrived hot; crispy, and the delivery drivers have always been very polite. The drivers often bring extra napkins, grated cheese packets or crushed pepper packets (nice touch).  I've traveled extensively for the past three years and have stayed in many cities; using various Domino's across the U.S. The 3510 Bell Road Domino's has been among the best in terms of service and quality of product delivered."}
{"text":"let me start by saying i used to like it here. they must have changed managment since the past copuple times i came here they sucked!the first few bad times my pizza was under or over cooked me belivining it was a bad day still went back.then the last time i went there i ordered online as i usually do (it was about 7:30pm) i thought it would be a fast dinner to grab before i got my niece. we came 15 minutes after ordering (online tracker said it was done) they told us it would be about 5 minutes before it was ready mind you it was already paid for. then about 30 minutes laters we went and asked and they said it would be another 5 minutes this happened till we had waited an hour and a half. then finally i went and told them it had been over and hour and they grabbed it off the heat rack! the employees all were goofing around and on their phones and not paying any attention to the costomers when we got  there they had the doors closed and we had to order through a window which they used to not do till after 9pm. over all the employees were lazy and rude. I feel i wasted my money and recomended thaT YOU GO SOMEWHWERE ELSE."}
{"text":"Fast, courteous and the pizza tastes great. Never eating at Little Caesars again, I rather pay the $3 extra for a fresh Artisan than $5 for something sitting out for hours."}
{"text":"Pan Xtra Cheeseless Pizza from Dominos on Cactus, in Peoria. Lol... Mr. Matt! You need to learn customer service skills! Choose a tone of voice that appeals to the caller. NO MATTER THE SITUATION!! As a matter of opinion, take some notes from Lindsey. She provided a much more agreeable tone of voice and customer service. I get it. You get busy. I've done your job and there are ways to make a customer happy when something goes wrong.   Thank you, Lindsey. Not (only) for sending in a new pizza and throwing in a free drink, but for using a tone that was much more controlled than your phone tech Matt.   I gave a 4 star rating because the pizza is always good here. However, customer service always trumps the food. Let's see what happened on our next delivery round."}
{"text":"Almost an hour wait just for a medium pan pizza and it wasn't even busy, I ordered & even paid ahead online for quick service and tracker said about 12 mins. Seemed like they were very short handed, only two people working. The owner here needs to hire some people, heard them telling customers on the phone 2.5 hour delivery time. Order #646960"}
{"text":"I ordered the two for $5.99 each special online a couple of times for pick up at this location.  They always had my pizza ready quickly, and were friendly when I picked it up. I couldn't imagine the transaction being any more convenient.  The pizza was also good."}
{"text":"Jacob was a bitch and my pizza had no cheese you need to get your shit together dominoes your better than this i guess im eating pizza hut tonight"}
{"text":"Great job Domino's you were able to find my friend's place in a large gated community... that's all you can ask for. Pizza was consistently good too!"}
{"text":"I ordered online a medium pepperoni pizza with two garlic dipping sauces at 5:15 and Was told 20-30 minutes. According to the delivery tracker, it was out of the oven at 5:24, but not out for delivery until 6:03. 40 minutes of just sitting there. It got to me at 6:25 an hour and 10 minutes after I ordered. It was not hot, looked like it had been sitting out and instead of garlic sauce I got ranch. Yeah. I'm done with dominos."}
{"text":"Phone was ringing off the hook - only 1 person there and I waited 10 minutes before someone finally came out. She then told me that she needed a band aid her finger was bleeding.  When I got back to my office I was horrified to see smeared blood on my box.  I will not touch this pizza and demand a full refund."}
{"text":"My family eats from this location several times a month. My favorite are the wings. The staff is friendly and the store is clean. Delivery is usually within the quoted time."}
{"text":"I always get good service with delivery. One time it took a little longer but they provided me with a free soda. The pizza always tastes great."}
{"text":"driver didnt follow my instructions. instead of calling me when he arrives, he called me when he started at the store. i was waiting outside in the rain all time because its a delivery to business. when he arrived i gave him the money and told him that i am upset because the order instruction was clear. he gave me the money back and was driving away with the pizza"}
{"text":"When we want something cheap and good we turn to domino's. Always has come hot and fresh every time we have ordered. Great when you are short on time, money and do not feel like cooking!"}
{"text":"This was actually some delicious pizza tonight.  quick too.  crust was awesome.  not the normal carboard.  it had parm and spices on the crust as well.  great job."}
{"text":"My longtime go to location for weekly takeout pizza for the family. We all like the Dominos sauce and original hand tossed pizza crust. This location always gives great customer service and has never messed up my order. They usually have good coupons online. Give it a try."}
{"text":"My wife and I were driving on 1st Street SW between 11th and 12th Avenue SW when suddenly a Domino's delivery driver pulled quickly out of a parking spot without signalling causing me to slam on the brakes and honk my horn. He then quickly changed lanes and waited for me to get to a set of lights and gave me the finger. I reported this to a Domino's employee but he gave me the impression he didn't really care. I described the driver as someone of African decent driving a white car. The \"manager\" of the Domino's asked me if noted the number of the car. I cannot imagine them to have 30 drivers of African decent driving white cars all making deliveries on the same street in question. If this is how much they care about safety, ask yourself how much they care about making your food!"}
{"text":"LOVE the easy online ordering and the cool ordering tracker!  We haven't been to Domino's in a very long time.  Years actually.  Then we tried them again, on New Hope Rd. in Gastonia. Not only was our order ready, it was right, and the staff was very friendly. Store was very clean, and our pizza was perfect!"}
{"text":"After eating you're pizza me and my husband got extremely sick and threw up for 2 days he had to stay home from work it was that bad."}
{"text":"The last time we ordered pizza on Super Bowl Sunday was a few years ago and we ordered from Pizza Hut.  It was almost two hours before we received our food.  Today we decided to order from Domino's and this is our second time ordering from them.  The first time we did carryout because they had a special, but since they emailed me some online specials earlier today we decided to do delivery.  $5.99 for two or more medium, 2-topping pizza, or 8-piece chicken wings.  First of all I thought that was a great deal, but when I received my order 20mins later I was shocked! The approximate delivery time was about 30mins at least, but since it's Super Bowl Sunday I expected it to take up to an hour if not more.  Actually that's why I ordered my food so early.  I mentioned it to the driver and he said that all of their drivers are out working today to avoid backed up deliveries.  I'm really impressed with the extra steps that Domino's is taking to ensure great service."}
{"text":"Awful customer service. Ordered delivery, drivers was great, order was wrong, called location to report and was hung up on when I stated my case. Never again. Again, delivery driver was friendly and prompt. Management upon calling location was -1 out of 5. Never again. Sorry delivery driver. Not your fault."}
{"text":"Ok my order total was 26.05 and I had a 50$ and they said we don't have change,,, like really you don't have 24$ in change ,, like where the hell do they think we are , is the neighborhood that bad , or crime that crazy that they can't keep 25$ in change in the drawer ,, I WILL NEVER ORDER for this place again ,, just an FYI  the only place to give me change was the Panni place on the corner ,, do yourselves a favor and just spend your money there ,, as for me I WILL NEVER ORDER from this place again,,"}
{"text":"Great food! We ordered delivery and the pizza and wings were very warm when they arrived."}
{"text":"I drive a truck. So, to order online or at least by phone is a big plus. I was in the parking lot and didn't know the zip code to order online and the phone was nothing but musak with words. No satisfaction. So, I go inside and order only to here it will be 15 mins. The same amount of time I tried to order from the parking lot. Technology is fine when applied right."}
{"text":"Wow! Super impressed. Did an online order in the morning for a kids birthday pizza lunch. Needed 9 pizzas and some wings. Ordered the $5.99 special of two or more and some wings and it came to $75. I got to pick two toppings for each pizza included and pick the time of the delievery. Everything was perfect and the pizza was delicious. How did I never know that dominos did white pizzas for no extra charge!!!???! They were so fresh and tasty and delievery guy was super friendly and professional. Will totally use the online system again! Thanks dominos!"}
{"text":"Would give it zero stars if I could! Absurd attitude and incompetency from the employees. Service was insanely slow.  I put an order and it took an hour and a half for delivery (store was half a mile away from delivery destination). This is Domino's!! Should not take longer than 30 min or the customer should get a free pizza - isn't that what the ad used to say?   Slow delivery was blamed on the rain, but it certainly wasn't extreme enough to delay this long.   I called 3 different times to check in with the employees.  The first two times, I was told he had already left (later I found out he hadn't). I was also told that they could not contact him once he was out for delivery.   The last time, an employee called him to figure out where he was (so I guess they could contact him after all?).   I ended up receiving a cold, soggy pizza. And it definitely wasn't free."}
{"text":"I hate to leave a negative review of a Donino's franchise as I've been a loyal customer for over three decades. However, this was THE worst Domino's I've ever had by far. Ive had cafeteria pizza back in the 70s better than this. It was like eating a manhole cover. New to the area, on a Tuesday June early evening, we chose this franchise last night as its closest to my temporary McQueen/Guadalupe residence in Gilbert while listing my house for sale, downsizing. The franchise at Val Vista/Warner arguably has the best Domino's pizza I've ever tasted... always fresh, soft, buttery crust - phenomenal staff and management. This locale was the exact OPPOSITE. Two pizzas on the $5.99 large 2-item  carry out special: Mushroom/Sausage for me and Canadian Bacon/Pepperoni for my friends. The mushrooms were like rubber and what little sausage that was on it was nuked. Their pizza was no better... even after I added pineapple chunks to bring out more flavor. The Canadian bacon was like plastic and the pepperoni was like jerky. The crust on both pizzas was like baked cardboard - my Labradoodle had a hard time eating it. Lol. It honestly was inedible and unsatisfactory, ruining a nice evening. I called the measly-sounding manager who was the one who made it and he matter of factly said he'd give me $15 off my next order - and I'm like... order of WHAT??? It sure as hell won't be pizza, cuz he doesn't know how to make it - and only a corporate overhaul could improve it. I guess pasta as that's hard to screw up - lol, but as inept as this place seems to be from others on my Facebook validating, I'm thinking I will just drive an extra 7-10 minutes each way to my old neighborhood franchise. Unless there is new management, this place is doomed and completely not representational of Domino's quality - or a gas station's pizza quality, for that matter. I'll pass, thanks. Avoid until you see the \"under new management\" sign. Sorry, but if Yelp had a zero-star option, I'd use it, because a 1-star is entirely too generous."}
{"text":"I love Domino's but this location is the worst!  I've ordered many times from them because they have more items for desert than other places that deliver. After over a year of bad service and burnt food, i am finally done with this location.  The pizza is always a mess, so after about five bad consecutively pizzas- i had stopped ordering them. They were burnt, clearly dropped while in the box, sloppy, not cut properly, clearly werent made according to my \"special instructions\" (easy on sauce- it will arrive drenched in it!)... just crap!  The desserts: I love Domino's lava cakes! They are super cheap, and even come in two piece servings! They come in a nice tin cup and melt in your mouth delicious!!! Not here.  Here they don't always come in a cup. Sometimes they come upside down, other times right side up. They have a massive amount of powdered sugar sprinkled on them. They are constantly either burnt or undercooked. Ordering the two piece never works... they just bring the one and then argue with you at the door: \"But here this is what it says!!!\" - pointing at your receipt which is written correctly. When you point that out, \"they dont know\" and then they \"no English\" you.  The marble cookie: another miracle Dominos has to offer. Chewy, melty, marble chocolate heaven, that is just as delectable the next day! (Yes... I truly can vouch for Dominos dessert - I loveeee it!) At this location?  A dry, overcooked, cookie. Not a good cookie, just not sure what else to call it. Not always, but %80 of the time. The staff is rude over the phone, so I used to order online. They were rude to my boyfriend when he would come in to pick up the food- yelling at him because his order was there for 20 minutes and the store was closing in 30 mins from when he walked in according to the schedule on the door.  The last experience i had- the delivery guy called me sounding angry. He was being very rude and lecturing me for \"having a broken buzz\". I assured him that it is not broken, and repeated the unit number he should press. He kept saying he knows and \"i have a broken buzz\". I came down. He asked if I want to try my \"buzz\". My buzz buzzed. He was buzzing the empty unit next door to me where the tenant had just moved out. I paid him and went upstairs... whatever.  When i got upstairs, and opened my marble cookie, i saw that it was all hard. It was clearly dropped because it was split in several places. My lava cakes were also dropped- because they were over cooked again, they were hard and cracked, leaking the chocolate \"lava\" everywhere. I guess when the guy was playing with the \"buzz\" my order fell several times.  Never again.  Screw you guys!  Domino's should forbid you people from ruining their food!  I can't believe you found a way to make me this furious with one of my favourite delivery spots! Shame on all of you for doing this to people.  Worst, absolute worst, place to ever order from!"}
{"text":"Worse customer service ever!!! Ordered food to be delivered to me at work.. said delivery time 27 to 37 mins... needlesss to say.. my food for over 30 mins said it had been checked for perfection.. with my food sitting there over 30 mins and still not leaving store and I have a meeting to attend.. called the store to cancel and response was put me on hold and ok it's been cancelled... well jus wow! Guess no lunch for me today!!! Will never go here again!!!"}
{"text":"Horrible place!! The man hung up on us mid order saying hurry up I don't have all night! Well guess what. No one is in a hurry to order dominoes lmfao!!! It's food you order when nothing else is available. Like what we tried. LOL! Sorry u hate your life but good night Bahahaha wish I could rate less than zero."}
{"text":"Called over an hour in advance, just wondering if they could help me out with a favor and place the pepperoni to say \"25\" AND THEY DID! Very nice staff. Pizza was ready and still hot! (Candles we're from dollar tree)"}
{"text":"Today was my second order of a Brooklyn pizza from this particular restaurant. The first time the pizza was over done but it still was acceptable. This time not only was my pizza not ready via online ordering meaning I had to wait in the restaurant for a full 15 minutes while it was being finished even though it indicated it was supposed to be ready 15 minutes earlier. The pizza was not hot which is weird since they handed it to me in the restaurant apparently when it was done. But a five minute drive home and the pizza was already below lukewarm and I had to heat it in the microwave. This is two bad experiences in a row with this restaurant and I will never visit this particular Domino's again."}
{"text":"We have shopped at this location for some time, however, in the last 6 months, the quality of the food has definitely gone down. We ordered a pizza tonight and it was dry with fewer toppings. This is the second time this has happened in the last month. I have discussed this with the management, however, their only reply is to give me a coupon for a future purchase. After tonight, we have decided to stop using this Domino's and rather drive a little further to get better quality."}
{"text":"The pizza itself was mediocre at best, I ate it but it's nothing to write home about. $20.00 for one large 3 topping pizza is a bit pricey I think. Delivery time was off by 15 minutes late. And to top it all off, when paying by card you are asked to add a tip when the driver gets there. WTF? I,m being charged a separate DELIVERY CHARGE and I'm expected to tip too? Isn't the tip the delivery charge? Hell, why not throw on a road tax charge of a couple bucks and maybe a fuel tax charge and an environment tax charge, then you can justify $30.00 for a pizza. There's gotta be something better than this."}
{"text":"I was surprised that they wouldn't deliver to a location less than 2 miles away, but was going to be passing by and decided to order for carryout. When i arrived, the staff consisted of 3 people: 1 steadily on the phone taking incoming calls, 1 making pizzas, and 1 prepping. I was greeted promptly but had to wait to be actually helped. They couldn't find my pizza among those waiting for pickup. However, the phone attendant recalled taking my order and began to ask if it was still in the oven. Unfortunately, no one remembered making it. So my calling ahead did no good. The phone was ringing steadily and i didn't see them all punched into the computer, so i probably wasn't the only order missed that night. 3 stars because the pizza was tasty."}
{"text":"From start to delivery was about 20 min!! Our food was made perfectly and the driver was really nice and respectful when knocking! He didn't bang on the door and my little one slept thru the delivery which was great cause it took me a long time to put her down!!"}
{"text":"Went to pick up my pizza yesterday and 2 of the 3 guys taking the orders and taking the money had pizza covered hands - got some tomato sauce back with my card.  Clearly poor hygiene there."}
{"text":"This location doesn't even deserve one star. Called an order in at 7:15 on a Sunday evening and after an hour and 15 minutes I called the store. After they checked my order they said it would be ready at 9:20. I wasn't rude at all but confused and said that it had already been almost 1.5 houses and the lady on the phone sighed and said very sarcastically \"yeah well we are busy...wanna cancel?\" I said absolutely and proceeded to ask if I was going to be refunded since I prepaid online. Got another dramatic sigh and she said\" yeah sure\". I kindly asked how much the final charge was and when I would see the refund and she said \"5 days\" and hung up.  Extremely terrible service! I will never order pizza from this location....maybe even Dominos in general."}
{"text":"Save yoursel time and go to the pet haircut place next door and ask them to box you up a dog treat."}
{"text":"U could tell the guy who answered the phone was pissed off. He was so rude, rushed me through my order and was frustrated when I had to go back add something to my order.   I literally was so blown away with how short and rude he was I canceled my order. No thanks!"}
{"text":"So I just tried ordering a pizza from here today but I spoke with Rachel and She mentioned that they were no longer doing carry out nor delivery. They don't even close for another hour! I asked to speak with a manager but she mentioned she was the manager. I asked her what was the reason that they were no longer doing carry out nor delivery but she said that's what she was told and that she just came in? Told by who? I thought Rachel was the \"manager\" but she couldn't even answer as to why. Not even an apology. It's not my fault if they are backed up or whatever the reason may be an hour before closing.They need to get it together here!"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying, if I could give them 0 stars, I would. 1 star is being generous. This is the second time we've had issues with this store and after the time, we stopped ordering for a while but then after about 8 months decided to give them another try. What a mistake. WHAT. A. MISTAKE. they forgot our soda (which happened to be the root of the problem the last time as well), we were told they'd be back with it in an hour. Now, that right there is absurd to me... An hour?! I ordered the soda to go WITH my pizza.. I mean, really?? OK, so an hour comes an goes, we call back and are told that the delivery driver just came and got it and it on his way. A half hour later.. You guessed it, still no soda (we live a mile away, FYI). So we call yet again. The 'shift leader' answers and wants to know who told us he was on his way.. Well, as much as I like to make it a habit to learn all the names of the employees of surrounding businesses, we didn't know who this person was. So let's skip to the real reason for this review. Although there are LOTS of things I could write about and truthfully, probably should, what prompted me to write this review was that the lady on the other end of the phone dropped the F bomb at my husband. And not just once or twice, no no, about 6 times. Was he heated? Yes. I'm not saying he was a doll about the whole thing. But she started swearing and threatening to call the cops on him because he said he was going to just come get it himself. Seriously. Just never ever again. Never. Ever. All we wanted was a soda!"}
{"text":"If you are going to spend $30 on pizza and wings I highly suggest going somewhere else. The crust was hard and cold when it showed up to my door and the pizza looked like it was cut by a 3rd grader. Actually, I wouldn't even give it that much credit... more like a 3 year old. And they forgot all the sauce we ordered with the wings. A sorry excuse of a pizza, and a waste of a cheat day."}
{"text":"So, my boyfriend got out apartment number wrong. After waiting an hour and a half for our food I looked at the email and realized it. We called and they said they went to other address and they will be back over here to get us our food soon. Not only did they bring the food pretty quick they re- made it for us and it got to us nice and hot and in such a good timely matter. I really appreciate this! Great customer service."}
{"text":"Absolutely terrible.  We ordered pizza at 3:12 pm and we're told 40 minutes. At 3:40 I checked the online tracker to see if it was almost done and saw it was taken from the oven at 3:38. At 4:22 I got my pizza. I live 1.2 miles away. The delivery guy handed it to me and said \"sorry about the wait, it still feels pretty warm.\" You're joking right? I just paid for a soggy, cold pizza that sat on their counter for 40 minutes. Their pizza is not great when it's hot, it's disgusting cold."}
{"text":"Hate this dominos! They never have online ordering available and when you try calling, they hang up on you!! They are always understaffed and the staff they do have is rude."}
{"text":"This location screwed up my pizza a few weeks ago and I did a review I was called by a manager who said he was leaving a credit for 1 pizza and wings under my number. I called tonight to use that credit and I was told there was no such credit left for me. Justin who I was speaking with said he would give me a pizza free and I declined stating what I was told which was pizza plus wings. Get your crap together! We order from your location several times a month. Not anymore!"}
{"text":"They always get my orders right and the food is delicious. The delivery is prompt and convenient.. I love that I can use the app on my phone to order too."}
{"text":"I order from dominos once a year. I ordered it tonight because they were the closest and they are open till 12 a.m. for delivery. Every time I order from them, in the back of my mind I am hoping for something different. The fact of the matter is, it's the coke zero of pizza. It's still around to make every other coke product look good. The pizza was 40 min. late. The cheese was so cold that it hardened and glazed like a donut. The crust was so thin you need your reading glasses to see it. I could see they tried to make an attempt to season the crust with my magnifying glass. The dough was under cooked, like they shoved it thru the rotisery to save time. The sauce taste like salsa filler. The ranch cups were smaller then a kurage coffee packet. The pepperonis were so thin and small that a gust of wind flew by and it was magicly a plain cheese. The wings were a soggy mess. I ordered hot and they tasted like mild. My stoned brother took one bite and threw it on the floor. I watched as ants went around it. Honestly the prices are too high. The larges should be 5 bucks and tums should be a topping. Save your money untill the sun comes up."}
{"text":"In fact the service for my order was so damn bad, i decided to register to yelp and write a review for all to know...  First time i order from dominos online, i get this store, place my order, pay online and everything is does fine...  Except it's been over an hour and i'm still waiting for my order to arrive, according to dominos online order tracker, my order has been out for delivery for 64 minutes....  What kind of service is that, i'm currently on the phone to complain with the manager, and guess what, it's been 9 minutes since my called was answered by their system, and i can't even speak to a human, all they got is a recording of all their specials...   UPDATE: just hanged up with the store's manager told me to call the general manager at the store in Sahara and Valley View... called there, and their manager shouted to me on the phone, you can tell they are having a lousy day, but i'm not the one to blame... i'm just another customer that ordered and payed for a pizza, because he was hungry, and 2 hours later i'm still hungry because of them, now i'll have to wait for 3 to 5 days to get my money back?, that's what happens when you order from this place...  Next time i'll just order from Pizza Hut or Papa John's, who BTW i'm sure are really thankful of how Domino's treats their customers...  Please look at the attached picture, so you can see by yourself..."}
{"text":"Well, I like Domino's pizza, but when I saw there was just one review for the local Domino's and that it was 5-star, I thought I needed to provide a bit of a reality check!!  I will definitely say, that of the big national chains, Domino's is my favorite though."}
{"text":"The delivery person could not find my home, which I don't understand because every other place I have ever ordered food from has never had this problem. I called them just to just see if I could get fresh pizzas sent to my house instead of the ones that have now been sitting for 45 minutes. I spoke to the manager Joel who would not do this for me without me having to completely have me resend all of my information and reenter my card number for a second transaction. They already had my payment, my address, and my order, this request just seems unreasonable. Joel then tried to argue with me and offered no solution. I have been in management for 10 years and this was absolutely shocking to me. This was the worst customer service I have ever experienced and it is going to take a lot for me to ever consider ordering from here again."}
{"text":"This is literally the slowest method of obtaining pizza in Charlotte.  You might as well drive to the store, buy all of the ingredients, and bake your own pizza at home before your order arrives.  And it will be cold.  I keep giving them more chances and it's always the same story."}
{"text":"We pretty much order from here twice a week. Always on time for delivery and always very nice when we go in for pick up."}
{"text":"READ BEFORE USING CREDIT CARD!  I travel quite a bit for work, so sometimes I like to sit in my hotel room & not move. What do I do for supper?..I order a meal from dominos, sometimes I'm skeptical about using my CC over the phone, but I'm too trusting I guessing. I use my credit card one time in Charlotte, & that's to order dominos! Magically that same credit card gets used fraudulently to make on line purchases, not even 2 hours after I order dominos. Huh?!? I wonder how they got my credit card information?? Would NEVER order here again!"}
{"text":"One of the best Domino's in town very friendly and good service!! Always there when I don't want to make dinner .."}
{"text":"We haven't had dominos in quite awhile so we decided to give them another chance.  Ordered a simple pizza bacon and double mushrooms.   We found out real quick why we avoid this pizza.  That is 2 slices of a mushroom on a slice.  F()ck dominos"}
{"text":"Ok, maybe I'll just keeping a tally here.  Ordered the usual, 2 topping med pizza with meat and a bacon/jalapeno cheesy bread.  I got the 2 topping with meat and a CHEESE stuffed cheesy bread, instead, again.  If I had better pizza delivery places to choose from...I would.  But for now, I'm stuck with them and they're stuck with me.  I think they are conspiring against me.  So, now I sit and wait 45 minutes for the correct cheesy bread to be delivered.  I hope they don't put any extra \"ingredients\" in there!  Until next time, happy eating!"}
{"text":"Thumbs down!    Pizza is good for  cheap pizza.   When ordering they don't advise of specials.    This is not gourmet pizza and charging gourmet prices is unacceptable.    The employees are not helpful or friendly.   I'll drive past this one to go to another location!"}
{"text":"Terrible. Ordered a pizza with no cheese for my grandma and they put cheese on it. No big deal. Called them back and told them. They said they would make a new one and bring it and they never brought it by."}
{"text":"Just ordered a pizza for lunch. I have to say hands down this was one of the best pizzas I have had in a long time. I ordered the thin crust with sausage/mushrooms/onions and it was cooked perfectly. Also the delivery was very fast and the driver was professional and polite. I will definitely order from this store again!!"}
{"text":"Update: Just got a cold pizza after waiting for over an hour. Hopefully this isn't a trend.   This Dominos is amazing. Especially compared to the one I used to live by on Albermarle Rd. Corporate contacted me 3 times about that awful location. But this one has renewed my faith in them. My food always looks and tastes great and it never takes long to get here."}
{"text":"Update: Try us again, they said. We'll do better, they said. But this time I got soggy pizza with toppings falling off and dry wings with barely any buffalo sauce. I'm never ordering from this Dominos again.   This Domino's used to be A1. They made great food and delivered it super fast. But now they've gone downhill. I get that they're short-staffed, but I shouldn't have to suffer with lukewarm food and long delivery times."}
{"text":"I realized my faux pas with the last review.  Downtown Phoenix is the black hole of convenient delivery pizza.  Yes, there is Pizzeria Bianco but I have yet to find the time, motivation, and dinner companions to accompany me on a 3 hour wait for pizza.  So, we usually order from Domino's.  Partially because their Brooklyn style is pretty good and partially because ordering reminds me of a blog that had me laughing/giggling/snorting for hours: http://www.thesneeze.com/mt-archives/000707.php.  I occasionally find ridiculous stuff way funnier than most people would, and the thought of beef nuggets without footing is making me laugh at this very moment.  *wipes tears from eyes and takes a minute to calm down*  So the ordering is incredibly easy once I stop laughing about whether or not I want the toppings on the right or the left.  And they have the \"Pizza Tracker\" which tells you what stage your pizza is in and who is completing the task.  I have to say that Wade has done a damn fine job and I'm disappointed if we order on a night that he isn't working.  Not because other Domino's employees mess it up, we have just become fond of seeing his name.  Domino's no longer has the policy of delivering in less than 30 minutes or your pizza is free, but they do come damn close.  Our pizza is almost always here in a half hour (another joy of the pizza tracker).  My only recommendation is to never order the baked dessert thingies; they always taste like garlic because they're made in the same oven."}
{"text":"My pizza is Burned on the bottom and on the edges of the pizza and really unhappy. I tried calling in 3 minutes before midnight and it said u were closed even though ur were open for another 3 minutes. I am pissed and  disgusted my pregnant wife is mad"}
{"text":"The delivery drivers here are always fast and super nice! I recently discovered a delicious pizza here that everyone at my work seems to love just as much as I do. Pan pizza with Alfredo sauce instead of regular red sauce with pepperoni, mushrooms and peppers. So good! It's quite surprising just how good it is....I wasn't expecting gourmet when we ordered from Dominos the first time. We were all so shocked how amazing the pizza turned out! The only down side that I can think of is that they charge you for crushed red peppers. This should be a free condiment in my opinion."}
{"text":"I was very pleased to receive a response to my review that I'd previously posted. I was very disappointed in the situation that took place however, I do believe that the  Domino's corporates care about their customers. I actually mentioned my experience to a friend of mine and was informed that she too had a similar situation happen when her teenage son ordered from this peticular location. It's a little disheartening to think of how many other people may have been short changed by their delivery driver's. Hopefully this will be adressed and not tolerated."}
{"text":"It was so easy to order on line; I ordered a large hand tossed veggie pizza. I was quoted 10 to 15 minutes and it was ready exactly at that time. Being able to customize your pizza is great. The gentleman behind the counter was polite and courteous. The pizza tasted superbly delicious. It has been a long time since I have had Domino's Pizza. But after today's experience, I will be ordering more often."}
{"text":"Not good. I was shocked to find out that they now charge 1.50 for a pinch or two of red pepper flakes. It's as if McDonalds started charging for ketchup. I will say 7.99 for a large pie is a deal - but not if youre compensating by upcharging for condiments given for free in most pizza joints.  The pizza had a lot of bubbles throughout the crust and was generally lackluster.   Too many amazing pizza places in Phoenix to bother with this substandard chain.  EDIT: I have now heard this is a CORPORATE owned store I visited. Pathetic. Teach your people how to manage the dough properly. There should NOT be that many bubbles in my pizza and your employees should not RUDELY tell me I have to pay for red peppers when all the FRANCHISES in the same metro area offer red peppers for FREE."}
{"text":"I love this location because it's close to my apartment and my food always arrives nice and hot! The delivery people are always courteous and polite and my food has always been great and delivered in a timely fashion! Thanks!"}
{"text":"Ordered online and it was very simple. The food was delivered very fast and it was good! Home on Sunday for football and beers!"}
{"text":"Your staff late night couldn't figure out where a downtown hotel was located. I figured 90% of your business is late night. They were rude and disrespectful. Get it together."}
{"text":"Great pizza. Mushrooms actually looked like mushrooms. Unlike other domino's that serve a pizza with miniature mushrooms."}
{"text":"Last night did not really feel like cooking so ordered pizza in. Went with Dominos since it had been too long that we have enjoyed their pizza. They have such great deals for pizza and no delivery fees. We ordered the buy 3 for $5.99 menu items. All of our choices were the pizzas and needed 3 items on one of the pizzas so one of the pizzas was $7.49. Such a great deal on them all.  The pizzas were delivered and while the app is great in tracking the pizza delivery it was off by 40 minutes. With the pizza late it made us just long for it more and when it arrived the delivery driver was professional and had our order and was correct. It was not cold or too hot, it was just ready to eat for us. Will order again and everything went smooth and great."}
{"text":"After a long and hot day of playing in the pool at a friends house our group bbq'ed but now long for more. Swimming and sitting pool side really brings out the hunger in someone when the novelty of the sun wares down. Pizza is one of the  best ways to aid in those cravings and delivery is the only means. Dominos pizza was the choice of the majority since they were open on this Memorial Day holiday and continue to have great pizza at competitive prices.  I ordered for us all online which was such a simple means of ordering. The Dominoes tracker allows the customer to track their pizza order in somewhat really time. One can change the tracker to one of many different types, but my favorite is the island parrot that produced sounds of waves and cocktails while it tracks the progress of your pizza order.   The pizza was superior and delicious. We ordered two thin crust and two regular crust pizzas to feed everyone. I took advantage of the deal they offered on line of $5.99 with the purchase of three or more items each is this great sale price. We ordered just pizzas and our fourth pizza with two toppings was $5.99 too. With combinations of bacon and pepperoni or feta and mozzarella these are some of the topping choice we mixed it up with. Now with the tracker telling me that pizza is here it is time for eating."}
{"text":"I've placed an order, and the order never showed up. And I was charged for the order. I'm calling BS on this..."}
{"text":"I have been a long time customer of this location. Staff is always very friendly and pizza is always great. I don't know why but the past few months have been frustrating. Everytime they deliver they forget the dipping cups that they always charge extra for. I feel bad for sending them back to get them and in the meantime I have to wait while my pizza is getting cold. I called to remind them not to forget this time. So now we got the dipping cups but my pizza order was wrong. I was too frustrated to call and complain. Gonna be staying away from dominoes for a while. This is literally the fifth time in a row they messed something up."}
{"text":"Don't do it!  I think they had a new person on the phones tonight! Totally wrong! Easy order but when you don't hit the \"No\" button you get extra! Yuck! My large thin crust, extra crispy pizza with NO OLIVES, came covered in olives and soggy/mushy and small! Called and complained, new pizza sent, wrong again! I even called back to confirm, \"Thin and extra crispy!\" New pizza was thick crust and not crispy!!!!!! But I could eat it, no olives!  however, i Tipped the driver $5 both times, not his fault!  $28 plus two $5 tips for one pizza and a small brownie? Think again!"}
{"text":"Had this place for dinner tonight, service was very good and pizza was excellent. Will be ordering again on my next pizza craving while at home."}
{"text":"I'm surprised to see so many negative reviews about this location. We've used them twice now, and our food has been about as much as I could reasonably expect from a fast food pizza joint. It's been hot and fresh, ready when they project it will be (we've just carried out), and extra or double cheese just like we ordered it. I'll continue to go there until I have a reason not to go."}
{"text":"Today 3/1/17 i placed an online order. The app showed me they started working on my order of 2 med pizzas at 3:34pm but i received my pizza at 6:06 pm. How is this possible???? Funny thing i live not more than 10 mins away i called 45 minutes into my order and overheard they had not even started to work on my simple order. It arrived cold. Im an easy costumer i tipped the delivery guy :) on my behalf things were done properly. I normaly dont do this but i was really disappointed. Pizza hut here i come!"}
{"text":"So I am finally done with this location. When they first opened a few years back we would order delivery and every single time, something would be wrong with my order ie. no dipping sauce, wrong sauce, wrong pizza etc. I wrote their corporate and was sent an apology and a $10 gift card to come back. I waited a month or so and tried again and tried to use the gift card and guess what? No funds on card. I had then said forget it! If I want to pay for a crappy pizza I will go to the Hut or Caesars as at least I know that theirs is horrible but they get my orders right. I digress, I went there just a day or two ago and did carryout. The dude behind the counter took my very big, complicated order of a medium pep and a medium cheese pizza. I was told it will be about 15-20 min. Ok cool. 50 minutes later I walked up to the counter and said \"hey, are my pizza's ready yet\"? Dude looked and they were sitting there. Mind you I was sitting in plain sight just a mere couple of feet away from the counter. I was not hiding in the rafters or lurking in the shadows waiting to attack. The employees run around and look so disorganized. Maybe the franchise owner or manager should spend a little time here and establish roles and duties. The phone would ring probably 20-30 times before someone would answer it.   Appearantly this location has not improved over my two or so year hiatus and somehow is still in business. I had made a promise to myself to not spend another one of my hard earned dollars at this store again but was in a bind as it was late and my family was hungry. I would rather eat the crap on the bottom of my shoes before I spend one more cent at this location. Thank you for reading this and hope if you decide to waste your money here, don't say nobody warned you."}
{"text":"Was hot upon arrival the driver was nice and I fell in love with the mango habernaro sandwich. They make great sandwiches!"}
{"text":"Normally when to comes to pizza night, we get takeout from Villa or Rosatis, or delivery from Papa Johns. My husband thought it was time we changed it up a bit, so we decided to pick up a pie, salad and wings from Dominos.   Service was fairly friendly. There was one female employee that made a poor impression by getting in the way of the employee trying to help me and generally looking like she'd rather die then do her job. Thankfully the person that actually helped me did so with a great attitude and a smile.  I was surprised at the quality of the pizza from Dominos. The crust was perfectly cooked and had great flavor. The wings were meaty but not extra cripsy, which is how I always order them. The salad was nothing special.   Overall our order was better then I expected it to be. We will certainly order from Domino's again."}
{"text":"Young female manager very unprofessional and RUDE! Very dirty no hairnets no gloves manager only has access to register for cash purchases. Once she deals with money she goes back to making food without washing her hands...."}
{"text":"I picked up a pizza here a couple weeks ago, the pizza was typical for a Domino's, but I heard one of the employees being very rude to her co-worker, saying things like \"move\" \"just get out of the way\" and \"why don't you just go up there a keep yourself busy.\"   I don't think she realized I was in there (only customer inside doing a group pick-up pretty early). I was definitely shocked and felt bad for the older employee who she was being rude to, and felt it was inappropriate behavior."}
{"text":"If you're looking for authentic deep dish Chicago style, this is the hidden gem in Phoenix. Armado wips up a mean jalapeño pepperoni. Plus the atmosphere is on fire. Mike is always behind the cash register ready to welcome you with a joke. Steve...if you know you know.   Would give them 6 stars if I could!"}
{"text":"Was craving some pizza and wings. Usually support the mom and pop small pizza joint.  But this dominos wasn't too bad. We got the bbq chicken pizza garlic knots and hot wings. Staff was friendly service was quick. Everything was good. Nothing good enough to write home about but! If your hungry and need something late and don't wanna drive this does the trick."}
{"text":"Can never go wrong with Dominos! They now don't have their traditional breadsticks. They now have bread twists. Still good but really do miss the breadsticks. Too bad because they were my favorite and now no dominos have them.  Never have had a problem with this dominos in the past! Our dog also was their featured #pizzaandapet"}
{"text":"Worst service, I ordered a delivery and after waiting an hour and fifteen minutes I decided to give them a call. The manager answered and told me that they weren't doing deliveries anymore. I was never informed by anyone what was going on. When I asked to void the payment he didn't even ask what order mine was and just hung up. I had to call back and make sure he didn't accidentally void anyone else's order. Now I'm a hungry howies fan."}
{"text":"You know, it's a Domino's. The Domino's app would have you believe that they don't deliver to my place, but this one on St Hubert totally does, quickly, predictably Domino's-y in term of pepperoni and cheese and flavour and stuff. It's true that some Domino's are truly bad, and this is not one of those. The folks who work the phone and drive the delivery are easy going and friendly and the pizza comes well assembled and well cooked. Nevertheless. It's just Domino's."}
{"text":"I only order when I have to no time to get anything to eat. The pizza here isn't great, especially when your use to eating Italian pizza. If you want your pizza from here to eat good you should order it online and customize it yourself."}
{"text":"I'm not a big pizza guy and when I do pizza pizza is my go to choice. However, when I tried dominos pizza, it was pretty delicious. We got a large pizza with 3 toppings courtesy of a friendly franchise owner from Leamingon. Thank you so much!  All I can say, was that the crust was delicious, a little saltier but I like that. The cheese was just the right amount. The price itself is a little expensive, but it was worth the price, but I do wish they threw some fries or something. I would definitely come back for more though lol  The reason for the 4 star is for the fact that I didn't get any pizza dip. I guess pizza pizza spoiled me a little. And side toppings such as chilli flakes and other seasonings were not available.  The restaurant is generally a pick up place only, but it was clean and inviting so bonus!!! I wouldn't comeback to a dirty pizza joint."}
{"text":"This location is in my 'hood so I've had a few interactions with them.  They generally aren't especially good or bad, but last night they behaved like the Keystone Kops.  They have a new ap that sends you updates when your order is prepped, in the oven, ready, etc.  I was on a tight schedule, so needed to get in and out.  I arrived a few minutes after getting a text that my order was ready, which is where then fun began.  There were about 10 people working, but only one helping customers.  The woman in front of me placed an online order that they lost, so of course it took quite a while to sort her out.  Meanwhile, I stared in hope at a few of the employees, wondering if they'd bother to help me.  At one point one did come over and try to help, but the manager took him away and made him help get orders ready.  After way too long, the one person on the register got to me.  I paid for my order and he went back to get it.  He returned to tell me it wasn't ready and would be 15 minutes.  I told him I had a text that it was ready.  He checked again and told me ten minutes.  I explained I was on a schedule and couldn't wait.  He offered to have it delivered (which is generally a recipe for late and cold), and I asked how long that would take.  He \"wasn't sure\", but then discovered that my order was coming out immediately.  It was boxed and handed to me without an apology or attempt to rectify the bumbling.    I'm honestly not surprised- this location has always been poorly run.  Their drivers cut through my neighborhood to get to Sharon Amity, and they ignore the signage and speed.  I asked corporate to look into it, and the manager and owner both told me I was lying and would have to report license plates to them before they'd do anything.  It will be a shame when some of the businesses in this block get run out as bigger stores move in, but this one won't be missed."}
{"text":"I always get my food 30 mins or less right after I order. The deliver drivers are always nice and on time in my opinion. The food is always hot and fresh also. I have probably ordered delivery from here over 10 times."}
{"text":"I always order from this Dominos as it's the closest one for me.  They had a 50% off deal recently for any pizza at menu price.  I ordered a Canadian Pan pizza online and picked it up in store.  I placed the order and got there within 15 minutes.  When you get there, you will see a screen letting you know if your pizza is ready, which i found very helpful.  The pizza had lots of cheese, as well as, all the other toppings.  When I got the pizza it was piping hot, as it was just finished baking.  The dough was crispy and at the same time very soft and chewy. Absolutely love their pizza and look forward to going back in the next little while."}
{"text":"I am losing faith in Domino's. The past dozen times or so I have not been impressed with the pizza (which I used to LOVE). And today my pizza arrives like this..."}
{"text":"Sadly this review has nothing to do with the quality of the food, which is notoriously mediocre (but cheap).  I've ordered from this location countless times before and never had any issues. The other night, however, we ordered a pizza and received a phone call from the driver. He didn't want to park in front of my building because he had apparently received a ticket in this area at some point in the past.  The only problem with this idiot's complaint is that my building has a half-circle area where anyone can park for a few minutes and make a delivery. (I've had many, many things delivered to my apartment in the two years I've lived here and nobody has ever had a problem or gotten a ticket.)  Anyway, the amateurish delivery guy insisted that I come down to pick up the pizza, which I absolutely refused to do. (There's a Pizza Pizza literally across the street; if I could be bothered to go there and pick up a pie, why on earth would I call for delivery from a subpar pizza joint?) I told him there was no way I was coming down and the moronic driver said he was leaving with the pizza. I said fine and that was that.  Real professional, Dominos. We're done."}
{"text":"Ordered pizza tonight at 8:41 with an expected 60-70 minute delivery time. It is now 11:00, and I have been on the phone on hold trying to cancel my order for the past half hour and have not been able to reach anyone as of yet. Not the first time this has happened. I was forced to order from a more reliable pizza place nearby unfortunately. I'll bet they still beat your delivery driver here. I'll be tipping your driver as it's not his fault, but will not be paying for the pizza once it finally gets here."}
{"text":"Yes, this location is definitely out of my area, but there's a reason I ordered from them, so hang in there for a min or four while I explain - it's worth it.   So, I'm at John C Lincoln Deer Valley having lumbar surgery on New Year's Eve and I missed out on dinner because I got to my room late and the nurses could only offer me a Healthy Choice frozen dinner. I'd not eaten in nearly 24hrs and was about to chew my arm off, cuz starving and wired out of my mind (thanks to the gloriousness of hittin' the Dilauded drip every 10 mins - don't judge - you'd have been doing it, too, if it was your second back surgery in 5mos - well, and Dilauded, but I digress), so anywhooo...  I asked my nurse if I could have a pizza delivered and she said yes, soooo, hello Domino's. I ordered my fave, but only a medium instead of extra large (Wisconsin 6 Cheese, extra sauce - this isn't the regular sauce and is ridic tasty - on Brooklyn-style, garlic-seasoned, crust - I'm not wasting that level of deliciousness on thick crust), and the guy that took my order said it'd be an hour or so because 9p on a rainy NYE and told him it was cool and make sure the driver stayed safe. Also, I was starving and it's not like I was going anywhere.   When the very nice guy taking my order realized I was a patient in the hospital, he asked if I was gonna be okay, so now he's thoughtful, too. And thank you for asking, I appreciated it. :)  My pizza was there in 20mins, still hot, and I know damn well it was because I'd called from the hospital - so thank you, tons, belatedly, anonymous order-taker guy - I truly appreciated being bumped to the front of the \"line.\"  And yes, I tipped the delivery girl 25% because NYE, freezing cold outside, raining, and hospital.   Most important, my pizza was freakin' perfect and I ate 7 of the 8 slices. I'd have eaten the last one, too, but had promised a slice to one of my nurses so she'd understand, and appreciate, the fabulousness of this particular pizza. Yes, she was shocked I mowed that thing down like a competitive eater (told you, I was STARVING), and she even shared that last slice of pizza heaven with other staff because it was so yummy (so don't be surprised, Domino's, when the staff orders that pizza specifically like I did, right down to the extra sauce).   I apologize this is so very long and I'm impressed if you made it to the end. It all needed said - and thank you, again, Domino's that's not my regular location. All things considered, including my private room, my NYE didn't suck as much as it could've, and it was all because of you guys/gals. XOXOXOXO"}
{"text":"Always receive great service atleast when I order.. Food always shows up in the estimated time. Order is right. I started getting \"light sauce\" due to i think they put just a tad too much.. But they always remember to do the special instructions which is awesome. As long as I live in the location I will get delivery from this dominos :)"}
{"text":"It's a Domino's, so it's not going to blow you away, but I'm usually not too disappointed by this location either. The quality tends to vary from shift to shift, but most of the workers there seem competent (with a few exceptions). When I want a quick pizza this Domino's usually does a decent job of supplying it."}
{"text":"Can't seem to handle the promotions. Maybe still haven't stepped up to the Papa Johns closure.  1 1/2 hr wait isn't acceptable"}
{"text":"I  dominoes. It is sooooooo yummy!!!! By the way, I'm 9 years old. I went to the eye doctor today!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Most ridiculously rude,unhelpful, inconsiderate, nasty so called \"manager\" at this location. I've ordered multiple times for both work and home over the last three years for delivery and have never once been happy with the service, honestly have no idea why I've continued to order from there other than the simple fact of convenience. Trying to get ahold of someone at corporate is basically like asking to speak to the president. They seriously need to reconsider who they put in charge if they care about their future. What a shame."}
{"text":"I've been meaning to update my review.  After I left it, I was contacted by the manager who offered me a gift card to retry their pizza. I did use it and I guess dominos just isn't for me lol. The customer service and the fact they took out the time to make this right was the reason why I wanted to update this.  More companies should do this for their customers. 4 stars for customer service"}
{"text":"Let's be honest. This is Dominos. My expectations are pretty low to begin with, so to not even have my low expectations met is pretty pathetic. I received a flyer in the mail for a $7.99 3 topping large pizza plus free parmesan bites. Sounds pretty perfect, take out for $12 including delivery and tax! So I'm pretty excited about my crappy quality pizza to come, quoted about 20-30 minutes, no problem. And I'm waiting. And waiting.....and waiting. An hour goes by and I call them, they said it was walking out the door. I live about ten minutes from this location, and honestly should have just gone to pick it up myself. Because then I'm waiting again - another 30 minutes goes by and I call them and spoke to the same girl on the phone who said, \"They're leaving right now.\" and I said, \"Didn't they leave 30 minutes ago when I spoke to you?\" Awkward! I asked for a manager who was pretty apathetic (like I said, we're talking Dominos expectations here) and he said they were short 3 drivers - now I get that. I understand things happen but it's the lack of communication to begin with that hit a nerve. I cancelled my order and asked for a refund and he said it would take four days...great. So if you lost track here, that's 90 minutes, $12, and no pizza. The ultimate first world problem, I know, but if you're going to send out flyers and get people excited, make sure you can take care of the people you are luring in.  I have ordered from this location several times before and have received incredibly mediocre service in the past, but this one I think is enough to keep me from coming back.   I immediately ordered from Toppers down the road and received my pizza FIFTEEN MINUTES after ordering, yes forty minutes sooner than quoted when placing my order, and an hour and fifteen minutes sooner than Dominoes ever could have gotten here. Toppers is more expensive, but Dominos isn't worth the frustration if you ask me."}
{"text":"Good pizza , lots of options and speedy delivery.  And I have messed up orders twice and this shop goes the extra mile to make their customers delighted.  Plus ...it's PIZZA!  With a deal on the second pizza, why not try something different sometimes too?  Plus points towards free pizza."}
{"text":"This lady that's the manger here is  rude when speaking to customers aswell as her employees."}
{"text":"Avoid ordering from this location unless you have 2 hours to wait for your order. CSR's give a runaround rather than taking responsibility or provide any help in processing a simple order. Called to cancel and now I get to wait for a refund. Don't have insight to pizza quality but I would avoid this location and do yourself a favor. No one was rude, but unfortunately no one was helpful."}
{"text":"My goto place for cheap tasty cardboard pizza,a billion times better than the abominable pizza pizza crap. Can never go wrong with pepperoni with extra cheese."}
{"text":"I didn't get my order. they were rude. Lying saying they called me 3 times when I didn't recieve nothing. They cancelled my order and they were just a bunch of dumba***s. That whole shift needs to be fired for not working properly."}
{"text":"Daughter and I had a late night craving for a pepperoni pizza so we decided to give Dominos a try. The hand made pepperoni pan pizza well done was excellent! Everything about it was great. Dominos has really stepped up its game it seems. Delivery time was super fast and the driver was friendly. Just a little reminder there is a special instruction button when ordering online that gives you the option to order your pizza well done. For me this is great! I enjoy the caramelized cheese and flavor of the pepperoni when it's cooked well. Thanks Dominos for a great late night snack. Keep up the good work."}
{"text":"WOW! I saw that bad ratings so I was a little hesitant at first, but NO JOKE this pizza was awesome! Staff was friendly, and store was clean. All around GREAT"}
{"text":"Honestly I never thought I'd go out of my way to write a review for Domino's, but I love this one too much.  I placed my order at 5:30pm and was delivered to my front door at 5:50pm. I don't think I've ever waited 45 minutes for a pizza. Living in the slopes I order from this particular Domino's fairly often. The delivery drivers are always polite and double check my order. I love that they call as they're parking - gives me that extra 15 seconds to double check my cash count and go down a couple flights of stairs.  Also, the food is always hot and delicious! I'm pretty pumped about the garlic crust. I get my pizza with double pepperoni, sausage on one half and pepperoncinis on one half. A+!"}
{"text":"There's not much you can say about chain store pizza. Sometimes you get a great pizza. Sometimes you don't. The last couple of pizzas I got from Domino's fell into the \"don't\" category. I don't know if they've changed the recipe or the \"chef\" but something isn't sitting right. There was so much cornmeal stuck to the crust and all over the bottom of the box on last night's order I toyed with the idea of making polenta with it.  I don't remember ever seeing cornmeal like that. I wouldn't have ordered as often if I had. Say no to cornmeal Domino's, or buy a finer grind. Pizza shouldn't have a crunchy coating."}
{"text":"Always been a big fan of dominos, even though it is pricy, it is money well spent. Never had a issue with bad customer service, and they have always gotten my order correct ! Now delivery could be faster, considering I only live a block away! But it is always hot when it arrives so no worries. Five stars!"}
{"text":"I lov dominoes Pizza  the chicken kickers, and of course the cinnasticks. The only problem I has is the price. It is more expensive then most pizza delivery restaurants. There is no 2 for 1 here. It's a per pizza price.   What I like is you can order online and build your own pizza. It's really cool online application. The portions are nice, I am usually able to finish a large pizza alone in a night.  Depending on the nights, delivery can take some time. They do have a handy portal interact machine to use at your front door. *Word of warning they charge 2$ fee to use this on top of the meal and tip.*"}
{"text":"I wouldn't give it any stars but to release my review it has to be rated, I went here because I saw the large 2 Item Pizza special for $5.99 when I arrived at the store I went inside and it seemed nice enough abd there was a waiting area and so I went to the counter where there stood a African American lady with dreedlocks in her hair and she didn't greet ne she didn't say \"May I help you?\" Not even \"What Chew want?\" So I said to her \"Hi may I help you?\" And she looked at me like I had 3 heads, I continued with my order and l aid her with dirty cash from my sweaty pocket and then turned to sit down, I then proceeded to watch her with her dirty money filthy hand proceed to prep the dough for my Pizzas, while in the kean time there was a driver who came in to start his shift and took a dirty filthy Car Topper sign out to his car and placed it on his car, he came back in without washing his hands and went straight to the oven where he proceeded to take out Pizzas and slice them and place them in boxes for the deliveries or whatever. I was asked what \"Was\" the name on my order and I think I am still here and alive so was is not the correct question or statement but I told the gal abd she went to gand me my pizzas and I asked for a regional managers name and number and she gave it to me, I say all of this because come to find out this same original person who faulted to greet me and to wash her hands was the manager in charge there. So I get home and open my Pizzas and there is no crust, the cheese and sauce goes right to the edges of the Pizzas.   WOW Domino's you have fallen to behind Little Sneezers pizza in my book! I won't be back there."}
{"text":"Lol a pizza place that charges a dollar each of cheese and red peeper flakes are you kidding me ? I've never had a dominos charge me for cheese and peppers . My 2 pizzas were 15 dollars and I spent 8 dollars buying cheese and peppers. Seriously? I don't know if this is new thing at all dominos like I said I've never been charged before . Definitely will not be coming back to this dominos ."}
{"text":"I am shocked at what I just heard on the phone as a response from the worker who answered the phone at their place. I placed my order 30mins ago, called to check on delivery status, the guy answering the phone said the pizza is about to be made, & will take another 30mins or so to be delivered! I did that's a terrible service, to which he answered : I beg to differ, if you like to cancel, I'll be happy to do so!! I was shocked and just hung up!! No stars from me for this location ...."}
{"text":"12/22/2017 I just paid for a pizza from this location,my wife ordered on line Time was around 9.20pm when I pay them I took a look at the guys working behind the counter, they have no gloves  and they touch pepperoni/vegetables/cheese bare hand & they don't even care and follow the health department rules,maybe they think  night shift do not need follow the rules,anyway this is my last time come here, just take a look when you Guy's go to this place & Guys don't buy from this Dominos it's horrible"}
{"text":"THIS location is the best! I do not know about other Domino's locations, however, this one is utterly fantastic! First let me say, the price for a large 3 topping carryout is superb - only $8.65 compared to $12 (and change) for a xtra large ONE topping from Papa John's. I'd never thought I'd see the day where I'd say that Domino's is better than Papa John's but this pizza I had on this day was DELICIOUS - some of the best pizza I have ever, if not the best, had! The young lady, Jennifer, I believe, has to be one of the best pizza makers there is - OMG! Kudos! When I want pizza - this is the place from now on at the Park Rd Locale!"}
{"text":"My family has been ordering from this Dominos for a couple years now and have had no real issues, some slow deliveries, pasta dish was forgotten, very small issues. Management has always corrected the issues if not that day on my next visit. As the owner of a small business myself I understand how hard quality control is and if a few of the negative review people would have just called the manager to explain the issue they are having instead of immediately running for the cliche bad review they would have had a better outcome. Great service if just give management a chance."}
{"text":"If you go in to this place, there are only one or two very small tables. The decor is nice. But it's clearly a delivery or pickup restaurant, not for eating in.   That said, the pizzas are ready fast. I always order online, so that there is no confusion over exactly what I want and how much it'll cost.   One time, I ordered pizza for carry out and wasn't able to get there for almost two hours (entirely my fault, pizza was the last stop on my errand run). They were really nice and remade my order quickly. They get bonus stars just for that. I know some places would tell you that you're out of luck."}
{"text":"This Domino's is awesome. You always get your food super fast, in fact I don't think we have ever waited more than 30 minutes from when we ordered it. The delivery guys are always friendly and happy when they greet you at the door. And the most important part, the pizza is always yummy!"}
{"text":"I wish I could give this a lower review. I placed an order that was supposed to be delivered in 20-30 minutes. After 90 minutes and several calls to stop the order, they delivered it. I did not accept the delivery since the app stated 20-30 min, and I had made other plans by then. Now, after two calls, the store refuses to give a refund This service is horrible. If you cant handle the order volume, don't say you can do delivery in 20-30min and then not answer the phone when a customer tries to contact you."}
{"text":"Didn't think I would ever review a dominoes, but just wanted to give them a shout out !! This place was clean looked very organized and being that I am a server and pay with cash they have that option for pick up!! I was leaving work and craving a chicken parm sandwich , a friend suggested dominoes , I hadn't been in years and didn't know they carried that , lol they also have pasta, salads and wings ( of course pizza ) my friend also swears by their deep dish which I also didn't know they carried . Anywho I placed my order online which was quick and easy , upon finishing order I got an email stating pick up time of 8 to 13 minutes , which is about the time it would take me to get there , I arrived and was greeted by a friendly and professional counter man , he asked my name and order was ready !!!  My order included the parm chicken sandwich which when I got home was still hot and melty ,the bread was perfect crunchy on outside and soft on inside , simple ingredients chicken,cheese and sauce all which combined were an amazing value ( I have the other half for lunch!) it was great tasting and fresh. Also ordered cheesy bread which was hot and packed with multiple cheeses and still hot and gooey ! Also included dessert ( for my roommate ) which didn't know this but he swears by the molten lava cake ( I know that is his weakness , that's why I ordered) he says it's on par with if not better than Fleming's !! I usually pass on dessert but did taste it , it is great but a bit too rich for my taste but packed full of chocolate flavor ! All in all a great visit and will probably be back to try some other items I didn't know they carried ! Oh yeah they have ice cream , Ben and Jerry's just a few flavors and a bit over priced but convenient!!"}
{"text":"How is this even possible?   It's 10am on a Saturday, they were not busy from what I could tell. I would think that the employees can keep watch of one pizza. I'm halfway through my pizza slice when I notice a roasted FLY on my pineapple piece.   Wouldn't the fly, fly away as it is going into the oven. I feel like an employee had to have placed a DEAD FLY on this pineapple piece and then sent it through..  Gross and sad"}
{"text":"This was the worst experience I've ever had with Domino's. We ordered our food at 5:30pm online and it guaranteed us the food would arrive in 30-40 minutes. 30-40 came and went, still no food. I waiting another 35 minutes before I called back. The \"manager\" told me that the website quotes incorrect times and the driver was about to leave with our food, and I had to argue to get a discount on our late order. By this point it's been an hour and 10 minutes. We wait another 30 minutes still no food. I call the store again and she says the driver will be there. Needless to say our food arrives an hour and 40 minutes later and cold. Will be contacting Corporate tomorrow!"}
{"text":"I love the Domino's tracker. It lets me see what stage my pizza is at so I know when it will be delivered. I order my pizza without cheese and it taste so gooood! I don't even miss the cheese at all. I love Domino's and my pizza is always fresh and delicious!!!"}
{"text":"Beware of ordering online at this location. I ordered a thin crust pizza and Diet Coke. The order was promised to arrive between 32 and 42 minutes. I placed my order at 5:18 pm. The Domino's tracker said the pizza left the store and was on its way to me at 5:35pm! Awesome, right? Not so fast. At 6:06pm, I called and spoke with the manager to tell him that it was over 30 minutes late from when the pizza left the store. He stated, \"There's no other orders right now, it's PROBABLY on its way.\" Okay, you're missing the point--if it left the store over half an hour ago, it's going to get to me cold. The pizza finally arrived 6:15pm, cold, with blackened edges and the toppings only on the center of the pizza. The edges were folded over and the whole thing just looked disgusting. To top it off, I received regular Coca Cola instead of Diet. The delivery guy apologized and brought back the Diet within ten minutes (only reason I am giving 2 stars). I called the manager back and asked for a refund, and he said \"we don't really do refunds...we can make it again or credit your Domino's account.\" I'm glad he offered to somewhat make it right, but an apology would have been nice, too. Don't waste your time with this Domino's--order from Romeo's! Way better pizza and much better service."}
{"text":"Horrible service. Slow. And unfortunately when I reached out to management/corporate they didn't give a care.what would you expect. I wish I could give a 0 star."}
{"text":"I tried this place for the first time today. We live on the other side of town so we don't regularly drive by but when I was at the gym beside it the other day and the owner there ordered I knew I needed to try it. It was fabulous! Seriously the best pizza I've had in awhile. We got a half pep half cheese with cheddar cheese pizza and parm bites. Love them! Husband had the tomato bacon chicken and enjoyed them. Fast and easy to order online. I like that you can track your order too. It literally tells you when the food gets stuck in the oven. How cool! We will be back. I only hope we get one closer to our house.  Also update! They have seating inside and it looks amazing!"}
{"text":"It's a small pizza place designed for take out only but there are 3 chairs to sit and wait. They have tons of staff and it looks like an assembly line.   They ask for your name to put it up on a screen telling you how many minutes are left and what stage your pizza is at which is awesome! This is the most efficient pizza place I have ever been to."}
{"text":"I usually order pizza at late night and they take so long. Las time it's was over and hour. And I call and they just say that they have to much order. Some times it's pretty nice , like evening it's faster."}
{"text":"Very impressed. Ever since I saw that Domino's was moving across the street from my apartment complex, I got excited. No longer do I have to wait for pizza (Pizza Hut, I'm talking about you) for three and a half hours. Today Domino's opened and I came home from work and ordered some for a late dinner.  I ordered a medium pepperoni pizza, cinnamon twists, and a coke zero.  I got the delivery in the amount of time they said (25 minutes). The delivery guy was very nice and said that i was one of the first 4 to order from our complex.  Pizza looked amazing, tasted great. Twists were very good.  I know it is only the first day, but I am hoping they can keep this up and be a great delivery place for the area.  Good luck!"}
{"text":"Always a great meal here whenever we order.  Normally we order carryout, because its like a 2 minute drive from home.  The pizza and stuffed cheesy bread are quite yummy, and the lava cakes are great, but too small.  Thank you."}
{"text":"Every time I order domino's there is some form of an issue. This time I ordered two pizzas, both with extra cheese, both were burnt & both had plenty of areas which had absolutely no cheese. I'm at the point where I would much rather spend the extra money for fuel, pizza peel... Anywhere else. While I appreciate the voicemail the manager left me while I was typing this offering me a credit for a free medium pizza, I doubt that it will be used."}
{"text":"Ordered from here tonight. Pizza and wings came very quickly, tasted great, lots of toppings and reasonably priced. Driver was such a nice guy. Saw my son and showed me a picture of his adorable son! No complaints whatsoever! Will order from here from now on :)"}
{"text":"I ordered carry out from here a few weeks ago. When I walked in at lunchtime, no one was in sight. I could see my pizza coming out of the oven on the conveyer belt and waited for someone to come and box it up. I watched as it got closer to the edge until it went off the conveyer belt onto the floor. The noise from the pizza splattering on the floor finally got someone's attention and they came up front and told me they will have to remake it. No apology and I was already running late to meet someone on their lunch break that had a limited amount of time. The pizza I received was fine, but I would have liked an apology at the least for the long wait."}
{"text":"Very polite staff and very generous with the size of toppings they use. I only order as pick up to go and they are always on time no matter how busy they are."}
{"text":"I went to a function tonight and the pizza was undercooked, toppings were not spread properly and there was too much sauce. Train better staff please"}
{"text":"This is a great place for getting pizza for occasions such as birthdays, Super Bowls, ETC. I recommend Little Cesar's over this place is your just getting pizza for dinner."}
{"text":"WHAT? No half-stars?  Half as in1/2 of no other stars.  What nonsense.  There was a comedian who once said, \"...the worst pizza I ever had was still pretty good. I mean, tomato sauce, crust and cheese, how bad could it be?\"...and until now, I agreed.  It is -- is -- pretty good.  But, now, Domino's, particularly THIS Domino's, is the exception to the rule.  I ordered a 3-topping pizza and it was burnt.   It was overdone and it was burnt.         How is that even possible?  They bake a thousand pizzas a day in the same       oven, but my pizza gets burnt?  Geez!  In a Burger King-like contraption that is pre-set to          cook the same product over-and-over-and-over again?  HOW IS THAT POSSIBLE?  So, I got 3 topping pizza, on top of a crust that can only be referred to as a crust as an ordinary, normal reference; BELIEVE ME, that's not crust, it's cardboard.    Let me tell you how disappointing this pizza was:  I TOOK ONE BITE. I THREW THREW THE PIZZA ON THE FLOOR I THOUGHT, I'LL TAKE IT BACK TOMORROW, I'LL GET MY $8 BUCKS BACK I GOT UP THE NEXT MORNING, I WAS SO DISGUISTED WITH MYSELF, I KNOW DOMINO'S SUCKS IT'S NOT EVEN, IT SHOULD ASPIRE TO BE THE \"SUBWAY\" OF PIZZA, BECAUSE DOMINO'S -- is not -- NOT!! -- THE SUBWAYOF PIZZA,  SO BAD, I DID NOT TAKE IT BACK OR CALL IN.   I JUST DIDN'T WANT TO FOOL WITH IT.  I DIDN'T WANT TO SPEAK WITH ANYONE WHO WAS LIKELY TO TAKE PRIDE IN THIS HORRIBLE, HORRIBLE PIZZA  And then the guys in charge of this singular operation.  Hate their contempt for customers, hate them for berating two women in front of me.  Can I say, without cursing, how bad, indignant, self-reighteous they were?  I did, but I'm not satisfied.  What jerks.  No, really. So, here's the new deal: even at $7.99, but BURNT,  I never go back, I never eat their horrible product.  Thank you and goodnight  (drones are being tested inside Domino's delivery areas.  Great. Now you can"}
{"text":"Yesterday I ordered a large 3 topping pizza with extra sauce and it was, like their commercial said, $7.99.  It was hot, right out of the oven and it was still crap.  Who thought this crust was good?  I see now Domino's is testing drones for pizza delivery.  Which is great because now, fans of Domino's can get this crap pizza even more quickly."}
{"text":"Order carry out (as this is the closest Domino's location to me) at least two to three times a month form this location.  Always ready on time, order always correct.  Great deals online.  Have two pizza chains in my little town 20 miles north of here, but prefer Domino's."}
{"text":"Ok...DO NOT order from these guys on Friday or Saturday night...I have voiced my opinion to the managers...I told him that everytime that I order on the weekends my pizza arrives under cooked...this happen over 5 times....I will not order from here again!!.."}
{"text":"Well....I got sucked in. I already dislike Domino's to begin with...But I have been seeing all those commercials where they are bagging on themselves and saying how the pizza is completely new and improved.   Well that's a load of Horse $h!t.   We ordered a pizza last night because I am a bad wife and haven't gone grocery shopping. I say to the hubs, hey lets give it a shot. He moans in disgust. I say, well they say its completely new and improved, lets just try it out.   We ordered on line. That was really cool. You can follow your order in the shop while they are making it. We even knew our delivery drivers name before he got to our door because the update told us his name and that he just left. That's rad...I would give Domino's a 3 just on this alone!   We ordered their new pizza with the special crust and then new fancy sauce. Kept it simple and just got pepperoni on it. We also got an order of cheese bread sticks and some of there boneless chicken kicker things.   The chicken kickers were tasty. I really liked the dipping sauce.   The cheese bread was yummy as well!   The new fan-dangled pizza....HOLY GROSS!!! Same old Domino's people...   Do not get sucked into the hype of that dumb commercial.   The commercial should go more like:  Hey we have been getting complaints that our pizza sucks.  So we changed it up and guess what PIZZA STILL SUCKS!   Our cat that always begs for food didn't even come around asking for pizza. That's pretty bad, that cat will eat anything! In fact, from now on, any take out we get will have a Tuki (our cat) rating on it.   Tuki gives this zero stars, as he didn't even want it near him."}
{"text":"We ordered online, and were given a 34 minute delivery time. Cool. We ordered a Brooklyn Style pepperoni 'well done'  Our pizza arrived right on time, and was perfectly done. For me, it was a bit too salty, but what did I expect from a pizza. It was very tasty though.   Great experience here. This was our second time ordering here, and we have been pleased both times."}
{"text":"Your dominos delivery service is garbage. We ended up canceling our order. Food was supposed to be delivered an hour ago."}
{"text":"Ordered a one topping medium pizza and they forgot my order. My order shows up on the screen but they never made it. After 10 minutes, the realized and made one but without a simple apology. I waited over 30 minutes and only when I asked if they forgot about my pizza did they admit it. The person that took my order hid in the back room until I left and they did not offer anything to make up for their mistake. Very poor customer service. I will not be back. Bad way to build your customers for a grand opening."}
{"text":"Sometimes they deliver within an hour even though they're 3 miles away from you, and sometimes it takes an hour and a half. They will 100% forget the extra sauces you pay for; which you will feel bad calling back and asking for the sauce to be delivered, because you're a nice person...."}
{"text":"This review is solely for FRANK our delivery driver!! He was seriously awesome - hilarious and kind. I've never had a delivery driver make my whole experience. Dominos you need to recognize this employee!! Thank you Frank!!"}
{"text":"Very dissatisfied with the customer service at Dominos tonight. Decided to stop by because we saw the ad running on their Facebook claiming $5.99 pizzas. When we called, the employee had no idea of the special and told us to show the ad to the manager. He wasn't friendly either. When we arrived, the manager said the ad was for only for online orders. It did not say this on the ad/graphic! What is the big difference? We were scammed! We will not be from Dominos again. Local mom and pop places are much better anyways!"}
{"text":"They screw up my delivery order EVERY TIME- It's a Crap Shoot Tack on 20-30 minutes to order time on computer, and don't expect anything above satisfactory- It's Domino's, not Spago"}
{"text":"Ruined by b-day Oct 3rd.  Almost 2 hrs for delivery.  Tweeted issue, got a response from corporate but the store never got back to me.  Taking my business elsewhere."}
{"text":"Horrible pizza... To put it mildly. If the looks weren't enough to put me off, the burnt, super sweet flavour did. I would like to make a note on each topping but honestly if I just say that it was  charred would be ideal enough.   Absolutely disgusting. Would never go back there. To think they could in their right mind even think of serving that to a customer is beyond me. Wouldn't trust em to get another one. Wow. Gotta go do a listerine mouthwash to get this taste out."}
{"text":"The WORST! The only reason I'm giving 2 stars is because the employee Martin is always happy and helpful, everyone else I've come in contact with have been rude. There have been times where I've called and employees were laughing over the phone at something and I couldn't even order. Another time I ordered a pizza at 1135 pm and wasn't delivered till almost 2 am! I was in bed when my pizza arrived. I decided to give it another shot and ordered a pizza about an hour ago and again ... the pizza was mooshed around like someone was tossing it around in the box. I also ordered cinnamon twists with icing and of course I got no icing. I'm honestly fed up with spending my money here. The company clearly doesn't care how their employees act and I won't be buying from dominos again."}
{"text":"They seem to forget about the rewards. If you order so many pizzas online you get your sixth one free. Their Internet is so screwed up the manager at this place will not give me my free pizza. She says it's a third-party. Totally lost this customer forever. Dominoes if you're watching this it was at 3:50 PM on a Sunday. I would fire the manager in charge today. No customer service road and I will never do business with you guys again"}
{"text":"Why?  Why do you guys always forget my extra sauces?  Every time you forget them, how does this happen??  It's on the same damn menu my pizza shows up on!  The driver left fifteen minutes ago to go get my sauces and now my food is cold.  I literally wasted my money.  Never again"}
{"text":"Great pizza place! What's up with the little tiny baby chicken wings? Great service and delivery driver! What up with these chicken wings? Rip off!"}
{"text":"Not good. Do not make any promises you can't keep and stand up when you fail. My wife ordered a pizza at 6:38 pm and was told it would be ready for pickup in 15 minutes. I arrived on my way home 20 minutes later to be told it would be another 15 minutes. Forget it then. \"You want me to cancel the order sir?\" Duh. On my way home I called and explained my case - they were very apologetic. But still no pizza. You could've offered to deliver when I left your store and I'd be eating it now rather than typing this review."}
{"text":"What can I say for the numero UNO kingpin pizza in the world. They also deliver pizza and you always know  what you're getting."}
{"text":"Personally I really like eating pizza at chain restaurants. Dominos is really convenient & has a lot of options. You can get pizza delivered, while conveniently choosing from their menu online or even creating your own pizza.   Unlike other pizza chains, dominos has a rewards system which would be beneficial to anyone who eats pizza frequently. You gain rewards points from creating an account which also makes delivery easy, as you can have staple delivery addresses and payment methods.  They have a lot of different sauce bases, meat and non meat toppings. But personally I just stick with their speciality pizza, it's just easier and they taste amazing. My fav is meat lovers with bbq base. Their garlic dipping sauce is also creamier than other places & it makes for a smoother bite.   As for side dishes,I wouldn't recommend the pasta. The wings are good but only get it if you are really craving wings cause they aren't that special. As for the cheese/bread sticks, they are good with marinara sauce but must be shared as they are pretty salty if you eat too many.  PS: They also have walk in specials that are good deals & vary depending on the day of the week."}
{"text":"Every time we order from this location it's terrible. It either takes an hour and a half for deliver or the food is terrible. Corporate really needs to get involved here."}
{"text":"I ordered a couple of times from this dominos pizza and I find that their pizza is not consistent. Sometimes it is really good and sometimes it is not edible."}
{"text":"Almost always awesome service. I ordered once a week for eyar. For a while, I'm not sure what was going on, but the service was horrible. The manager call me to say I was a liar and I think might have called me a bitch, too. I think they had drug addicts running the place, or something. I told him to get help. That was a short period of time. Dominos corporate gave me like $100. It took me months to return, but I'm happy with the service again."}
{"text":"I want to give them a better review, the pizza is good, but they are terrible with delivery.  Ordered, they said they were over an hour, fine no problem.  2+ hours later and 3 phone calls, still didn't have the food.  Don't waste your time, go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Your average Domino's quality, but customer service is great. I have done a lot of pickups and had no issues at all. Order is always ready when I show up."}
{"text":"I enjoy dominos! This ones pretty decent, little slow on the customer service skills but not the end of the world. Also they should prolly clean that gross sliding window! Yuck"}
{"text":"Against my better judgement I ordered a large pepperoni pizza from this place. It was a big mistake. The pepperoni tasted like it was old/expired. It was the most disgusting pizza I've ever eaten. I'm surprised they are still in business."}
{"text":"Moving to North York in September 2011, for almost 3 years, this location has been our favourite place to get a pizza pie.    We ALWAYS get the walk-in special which is one large pizza with extra tomato sauce with 2 toppings for $9.99 and a garlic sauce on the side for a buck extra.  This location has very late hours (weekdays closing at 1AM) which satisfies the need for any late night munchies of a dirty, oily pizza.  The staff inside are easy to deal with.  They are not overly joyful or anything but they always have a good attitude and get straight to the point and key in our order.  No flowers, no candy, just pizza!  My wife was craving for pizza late night yesterday.  We ordered the usual and had pepperoni and green peppers for our 2 toppings.  I took a picture of it below and it looks almost exactly like the stock marketing photo!  CLASSIC.  When we got home, we opened the box and saw the steam rise up.  Looked absolutely delicious.  And it was.  The ingredients are so unbelievably fresh and tasty.  The crust is perfectly crispy, the cheese and extra tomato sauce melts together and are amazing.  I have ordered from other Domino's Pizza around the city but again, by taste and texture alone, I can distinguish which location is best and for us, and this one by far takes the cake..err I mean pie!  I am totally satisfied with this place and will continue to be a loyal customer here.  They just gotta keep doing what their doing.  \"If it ain't broke, don't fix it!\""}
{"text":"This is my go-to place for dinner when I'm pressed for time or just don't really feel like cooking. My family really likes their garlic sauce to dip their pizza in. The downside is that each sauce is .75 cents each. They deliver! That saves me so much time, there is a two dollar charge for that. Tip the driver because that doesn't go towards their tip!"}
{"text":"Just used the app and got the \"buy one, get one free\" promo.  Love the Dominos Tracker! It let me know EXACTLY when my pizzas were ready. Still tasted delicious with LOTS of toppings! Keep up the great work Dominos!!!"}
{"text":"BUYER BEWARE I realize that when you buy from dominos you are not expecting the best pizza you have ever had. This review is not based on the food.  It is based on the location itself. The location is only 1.3 miles away.  It took an hour and a half to get the pizza delivered.  In the past they have messed up our order and were very non concerned about it.  I just don't think they care about what they do.  Almost feel bad for them."}
{"text":"This location is very stingy with the cheese. I usually order from the 17th ave location by Westbrook, but it was closed so I ordered from this location. I ordered cheesy bread and large pizzas with double cheese,  which I paid $6 extra for.  Once I got it home to eat, the cheesy bread had little cheese on it,  and the amount of cheese on the \"double cheese\" pizzas couldn't even be considered enought to equal to the amount of cheese one would expect on a regular cheese pizza. I do like Domino's, however, I recommend you make the journey to the location in Shaganappi Plaza on 17th ave & 32 st SW instead."}
{"text":"The worst pizza delivery experience ever! I always order from this store...not like I have a choice right? The app chooses it for you based on location. Well  today they overdid themselves. I placed an order for a large , handmade pizza with pepperoni and bacon on one size, and just cheese on the other for my \" after school hungry\" boys, a side of wings for me, and a coke. When prompted to pay, I used a stored credit card. All seemed well until I got an e-mail confirmation with order details. It said \"pay with cash on delivery\". It would be OK any other day but today when I had not a single dollar bill on me. I called them quickly to figure out what happened. The answer was that they don't store any payment information, and that they have nothing to do with the app. Really? Then why make that option available if it doesn't work? Anyway, I paid with the card and patiently awaited for the delivery. The delivery comes, I sign the receipt, tip the guy 5 bucks, and off he goes. I placed the pizza on the table, sit the kids down, and go on to other matters. Just as I leave I hear them yelling \"eaww, this pizza stinks, what kind of pizza is it?\" I check the pizza, ordered toppings on one side, but it does look weird. I can't quite put a finger on it. Then it hits me. The pizza is white! They forgot to put tomato sause on it! Seriously? I don't know about the others, but we LOVE tomato sauce on our pizza. So the boys refuse to eat it. I check my order and it says nowhere \"no sauce\". I call the place, tell them the problem and what do they offer? To get a free pizza next time! 2 hungry kids screaming I want food. I declined, and for the first time in my life I made someone to redo an unsatisfactory order. They didn't argue, but it took an hour and a half process  to finally get the order straight. Will I order again? Yes, just because I have no choice but to use this store."}
{"text":"Pizza delivered hour and fresh to the door of my hotel room after 1:00 am on new years day. Awesome."}
{"text":"the pizza tracker is literally always wrong. im not sure who is responsible for marking my pizzas as prematurely delivered, but its pretty annoying.  otherwise, good stuff"}
{"text":"THIS LOCATION HAS THE WORST GLUTEN FREE PIZZA EVER I order GF from Domino's often - generally once a week. I've ordered it in Idaho, Arizona, California and Virginia and it's always fine. This one was far from fine. The texture was weird and it tasted \"off\". I don't know if they use a different source for their gluten free crust or if it was stale, but it was terrible. I ate two pieces because I needed to eat and then tossed the rest."}
{"text":"The only reason they got one star is because their delivery people are friendly and prompt and they are fast and convenient. Their menu is easy to order from and their food selections are good. Their problem? The food ALWAYS  has a problem. It's either burnt or missing or not cooked enough etc. Etc. Etc. If they would just cook the food so it's not burnt or the order is actually correct, they could vastly increase their market share I believe."}
{"text":"I was out of town on a business trip and this was the best option in the area that delivered. I called 2 hours prior to dinner to see if they delivered to my and hotel and they did! But when it arrived it was cold. Ugh!!!! I rate this location 2 stars."}
{"text":"Pizza is delicious. Cuz it has cheese. Dominos makes pizza.  So...  it's delicious.  I've been to better places but all pizza is delicious.  You can't go wrong here. Tip your drivers generously. They don't get paid much and you can handle and extra fiver."}
{"text":"hey, I ordered the pizza pie, it was delivered and consumed. I'll do it again..."}
{"text":"Been goin here for years. Its exactly what I expect from dominos. I love it. If only they sold tacos."}
{"text":"NEVER EVER EVER EVER EVER order from this dominos. I am a regular customer from dominos order 3+ times a week and I was treated with no care, no respect, the order was over an hour and a half till delivery and when I told him I wasnt paying because it was late he just took it back. I will now be finding a new pizza place to eat at just because of this one store. The \"manager\" scott did nothing when I called, didnt have a pizza delivered for free. Terrible service i've worked in resturants and pizza places. Beyond messed up DO NOT EVER EAT OR ORDER FROM HERE"}
{"text":"Pretty fast delivery service and the pizza came out still hot. The price isn't so bad for a medium pizza with coupon off. It serves it's purpose as a quick meal for a cold evening in. The pizza is awesome in a cold weather!"}
{"text":"This will be the only dominos we go to for now on . It must be under new management because it's so much better .  We went here about Six months ago and weren't impressed. So we gave it another chance and it's amazing just what we wanted fast delivery it was hot and tasted the way it should have !   So to this location if you added a new manager and or crew members . Keep them around ...   We will be ordering again because if our last experience. Tabk yiu"}
{"text":"The people in this location are pretty friendly. Parking is very limited and they warned us that if you park across the street in Cogo's parking lot, even if for just a few minutes, you will get towed.   I called in an order for pick up and 7:45 and they said it would be 45 minutes. That seems a bit long for a Thursday night when I was picking it up myself. The pizza and the order of cheesy bread were not hot when we picked it up, but the flavors were ok.  The experience was just ok."}
{"text":"DISCLAIMER- I normally hate chains and fast food and don't even spend energy on reviewing them. But this particular Dominos deserves a fair 3 star review based on the following-  technology- its pretty damn cool you can order and customize your pizza online and then watch a time line of it getting made. Seeing all the options on a screen in front of you really gives you the chance to play around and personalize your pizza. Then there is a little time line that lets you know when the pizza is getting assembled, baked, then ready for pickup.  crust- they actually have a pretty tasty crust. Its buttery and garlicky.  value- coupons for 7.99 3 topping pizza? I can find change all over my house for that!  Are the ingredients of the best quality? Of course not. Is the service amazing? Hell no.  But is it A-OK especially for a super lazy night when you are broke? YES!!"}
{"text":"4 stars for a pizza place? 4 stars for DOMINO'S? YES!  Why you ask? WELLLL bc of their customer service of course! I decided one day after the gym I wanted a pizza, what kind you ask? The ONLY kind I LOVE! Buffalo chicken pizza! I swear, I love it with all mah heart! Soooo I call in and try to describe what toppings I want. The sweet little gentleman took the reigns and said he will make me a perfect pizza!  20 mins later I check out the pizza and it looks AMAZING! I get home and take a bite and almost die! SOOOOO GOOD!!!   Go here for wonderful amazing customer service and pizza!"}
{"text":"Hit or miss!   Ive ordered from this bish a lot and for the most part theyre pretty good! These last 2 times are like WTF though! Ok so I LOVE buffalo chicken pizza, and its seriously not that hard to make! The first time they made me one it came out pretty good. I then ordered it from the Dominos on Del Webb and they made that bad boy on point! Plus the guy was a hottie!  Anway, about 3 weeks ago I ordered a pizza, it came out horrible! There was literally a bottle of red hot poured on my pizza! So I spoke to the manager and he gave me a free pizza. Well I redeemed it a few days ago and AGAIN I was displeased. How can you eff up a buff chicken pizza?! You put some hot sauce, cheese, chicken, and bake! NOPE.  Idk if Ill come back to this place, I may just go see the hottie who knows how to make the pizza!"}
{"text":"overall one of the best pizza places on campus but should really really really have nacho cheese as a dipping sauce"}
{"text":"The pizza was burnt. Not \"a little burnt,\" either. One side of the crust was black."}
{"text":"I made the mistake of ordering from this store because they advertised as being 'open late' on the key card for the La Quinta where I was staying. I spent 10 hours driving to Pittsburgh, and then what felt like another ten hours waiting. They told me 40 minutes on the phone, and then kept stringing me along for another 40 minutes.  By the time my order arrived it was ice cold and the time was 1:35 in the morning. If I could give them 0 stars I would."}
{"text":"I never like to write bad reviews but I ordered a pizza online after a looooong day of flying. The driver gets here about 12 min after leaving the location... she hands me the pizza but says she is going back as she forgot the rest of my order. Fine. She comes back the 2nd time, and when we got into the cheesy bread, we realize it's the wrong order.  we didn't even eat it as my kids don't like jalapeño. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"They may not be Chicago great pizza but it's pretty good. I absolutely love there BBQ chicken bites. I really only order for delivery and I've had a different driver every time and each one has been nothing short of friendly and considerste"}
{"text":"Never had a real problem until tonight.  My hand tossed pizza was flat and missing the garlic butter rub.  Called and talked to Alejandro.  He told me it must have bren a flat batch and he forgot to put the seasoning on.  Nothing he could do about it,  yet he's the manager.  Lost my business."}
{"text":"Yes, I know its Domino's, and I know there are better pizza places in town. However, when I want cheap, good, and fast delivery pizza, I call my neighborhood Domino's. I wasn't a huge fan of Domino's until they went through the whole ordeal where they changed their sauce, crust, ingredients etc after much public outcry (I didn't hear it, but it must have been crazy :-P ). I only really ate it in a pinch. Our typical order is thin crust with either white sauce, feta and onions, or some variety of veggies with red sauce. When we get the pizza, it always looks appetizing. I can't say this even for the more \"fancier\" pizza joints. Additionally, the delivery is always within 30-45 minutes, which is not the case for other places, even ones that are much closer to us. The ingredients are fresh, and the crust is usually very crispy but not hard.  I will also say that my most favorite thing about Domino's is the Noid...wait, wrong decade, its actually the online ordering. Domino's order tracker is very cool, its accurate and sometimes I just watch it while I am waiting for my pizza."}
{"text":"Next to and connected to the City Stop gas station. Friendly staff and quick service for carry out. Staff was brief on the phone but friendly. It is Domino's, so it is not the most fancy but the pizza looked and tasted fresh and delicious."}
{"text":"WOW!!  Dominos has REALLY improved in quality! I remember deciding not to eat Dominos anymore several years ago, as it was just.....bad. Consistently. Well recently we wanted pizza and we were tired of our two go-to faves, and a trustworthy friend had said that Dominos had really upped their game. The friend was right! We used to own a pizza restaurant so we are PICKY... And the pizza we ordered was (dare I say it?) about as good as ours was!!  Their sauce is now EXCELLENT...flavorful...what a real pizza sauce should taste like. We like thin crust and theirs isn't too thin and it's crisp...perfect!! And they LOADED it with toppings, including a seasoning for extra flavor. We are pleasantly surprised and, for the price, will be ordering from them again.  We ordered online and the delivery was very fast...less than 30 minutes at 7pm on a Thursday.  Only 4 stars because the wings were just average. But hey, they're not a wings place. Will update when we have ordered more...I've got a feeling it will bump up to 5 stars!"}
{"text":"My pizza was very burned. Not edible. See attached photos. The manager promised me I would get a refund, but I never got one."}
{"text":"Quick delivery! Wonderful smell! Fresh ingredients! DELICIOUS TASTE! We will be ordering from Domino's again this summer for sure!"}
{"text":"I've been coming to this dominos for over a year now and I've have always received wonderful service! Every time I order online or over the phone I get friendly service and my order is always correct !"}
{"text":"Its really a hit or miss place.  Most recent incident occurred after the order was placed online and call in before pick up to verify the order - all of this was confirmed. At pick up, nothing was done correctly but each pie had to go out the door to the all girls group so they could have food.   Initial responses to resolve this was handled well. The follow up was embarrassing as my sorority sister got to deal with all of this for me as I was indisposed. When I returned to handle it all - things went over smoothly and an apology given. There was  a new manager which had been relocated to the west location from the skirts of Waukesha.   Le sigh - it's domino's so you just make do. Or I guess you may want to."}
{"text":"Maybe because the pizza was free. Or maybe because we hadn't had deep dish in a while but this place was prompt, courteous, accurate and the pizza was perfection.   In AND out. No Complaints here and I wish they'd consider training other locations."}
{"text":"This Domino's is a hit or miss location.   Yeah, Yeah, Yeah.... it's a chain but I'm one of the folks that actually liked the crust before this new & improved crust came along. I like their sauce even the seasoned beef (because Pizza Extreme doesn't season their beef anymore I really have to make do w/ DP's).   This location is a crap shot. Somedays service is on point and they're about their business. Other days it's like, \"I don't own this place so I could give a care less. So what do you want? No, there are no specials. No, we don't make that. Yeah the banner out front may say one thing but I'm in person telling you another.\"  Think Chicago the movie when Richard Gere explains to Rene Z. about Lucy Lui, the Pineapple Princess, of what her husband says when she (Lucy) catches him in the bed with two (2) ladies. \"Who you gone believe, baby? Me or your eyes!\" Now that's funny.   This location is locally owned and operated. I appreciate meeting a really good manager some years back but again those days are nigh now the best info I can give is order online and you'll incur less issues."}
{"text":"Order online.  Pay Online.  Arrive at the location AND GUESS WHAT!!!?? You've got to still show ID and the card.   Well, alright. For all these changes I could have at least received the extra sauce on the pizza. Please know: It was not saucy but DRY."}
{"text":"Just ordered pizza and wrote in all caps \"DO NOT RING DOORBELL\" I even had the front door open and the delivery guy still rang the doorbell which woke up my daughter so I gave a smaller tip which he obviously was not satisfied with and proceeded to honk his horn loudly in front of my house before he drove away. I will no longer be ordering from this dominos again. I will be switching to a different pizza service all together. Crappy service all around."}
{"text":"Love Domino's Pizzas among all the chain places. Their online ordering and carry out  is the best. It's never been longer than 20 minutes for a pick up order and the staff are always friendly. Keep it up guys!"}
{"text":"THIS SHOULD BE A ZERO! Sooooo...ordered pizza online and this was the default store (since you cannot pick you store online, we will probably start to call in going forward). Our pizza TOOK TWO (2) HOURS TO ARRIVE, and the store is up the street (probably 5 blocks - which yes, we probably should have walked, but I'm lazy). We waited 30 minutes as we watched the tracker say that our pizza had arrived...LIES. After 10 minutes of that nonsense, we called in and they told us that the driver couldn't contact us, but our concierge had not seen anyone come through, and we had no missed calls. They told us that they would send us a pizza in the next 30 minutes. After 25 minutes, to be safe, I called in and they said that the delivery was about 20 minutes away, and that they would be there in that time. It finally came, and the driver let slip that they had canceled the order at the store...I have no words (or no appropriate ones)...Our pizza was cold by the time it got to us, the cheese was all congealed and weird and there wasn't even an apology.   I have probably spent hundreds of dollars at Dominos (thank you late night brain for this life choice), and it has always been awesome. But after this experience, it might be time to visit another vendor."}
{"text":"Pizza should be straightforward and simple - or, if you like, complex(!) We like it fairly simple - if we pick-up, we expect it ready. If we order delivery, we expect it within 30 minutes. This Dominos ticks all those boxes - they also have never made a mistake with our order, and the in-house service is quick and friendly.  Considering some competitors make you wait 40+ minutes for delivery, these guys get my vote for local pizza in Surprise. Thanks guys and gals. :)"}
{"text":"Used to order from here all the time, never any problems until now. Ordered online and waited over an hour, the tracker said it was delivered. I called and  was put on hold for a long time and then spoke to someone who informed me my order was cancelled because my address didn't have the unit number. I informed him it was the same information that has been stored on the site for years and that I was looking at it on my screen. Either employees are not paying attention or just don't care. Not worth it."}
{"text":"I ordered x 2 pizzas online. On arrival I was handed the order and made payment. I then opened one of the pizzas and noticed that there was a large round circle where there was no sauce or cheese. I spoke to Mr. Asif and showed him the pizza. His immediate response was \"there's nothing wrong with it\". I then reinforced what was evident and pointed out that I had been having Dominoes for years. Mr. Asif was very apprehensive and raised his voice, saying \"don't talk to me like that\". I was astonished, as all i had stated was that it would be obvious to anyone that the pizza in question was sub standard. Mr. Asif finally acceded my point and agreed to make me another single pizza whilst I waited. I said to him that this would not be practical, as the other pizza would get cold in the meantime. I then left with the pizzas, informing Mr. Asif, i would write in. He said, \"i don't care\".I am shocked at the way thing were handled and the way Mr. Asif is destroying Dominos goodwill. I hope the obvious training issues are addressed forthwith, as my UK Dominos experience has always been positive."}
{"text":"Delivery in 25 minutes!  Super quick and easy. The spinich, feta cheese bread is awesome."}
{"text":"This location is really close so it's always hot. In all the time I've ordered here they  messed my order once but after I called they immediately fix it and were very polite and apologetic about it. The delivery drivers are always friendly. I will keep ordering for as long as I live here."}
{"text":"Hate to give them a 1 because the delivery was fast, but I did order extra sauces that I paid for inn top of the free sauces that usually come. When I received the pizza and breadsticks, I opened the boxes and received no sauces whatsoever."}
{"text":"Never have issues here love the pizza and pasta :D Customer service it's okay lol but to just have some fresh food"}
{"text":"All I can say for this location is OMG, just skip the entire experience. The kids that work at this shop have no clue on what they are doing. I could go in depth, but just take my warning look for another pizza place!!"}
{"text":"Don't get the wings. They are gross. Pizza is pretty good as well as the chicken pasta. Delivery is fast."}
{"text":"DO NOT ORDER FROM THIS LOCATION!!!! I have been a long time customer. I recently moved across town and have had nothing but problems with my new location. The first time I ordered pizza last month it came burnt and the manager was rude and ofered no help when i called and complained. This time they did not even deliever my pizza at all. They claimed they call me, yet my phone never rang. I called after waiting over an hour and the manager informed me that the driver got lost, tried to call and since we didnt answer they canceled the order. I NEVER recieved a phone call. i had my phone next to me the entire time. They offered no way to fix this. he simply told me it was my own fault. Before i moved I ordered from dominos at least twice a month.. Now, I have been ordering pizza hut because the service at the lake mead store is horrible. The manager is rude and worthless. I will NOT be giving them a third chance."}
{"text":"I'm a regular caller just wanting  to place  my order.. I love Domino's pizza,  But Everytime I get told they don't delivery to my house even though they have  before so last time I just went to go pick my order up.  So I decided  I'll try this time again , that was a big fail!!  I was told no!  Even though  when I get on the app and put my location  this one comes up.. So I call again I get told yet again how I am incorrect.. Well now I'm get told to call  other Domino's pizza near me... Like always  I do. .. an they are all telling me that the Domino's off Marks St is they one I should  be placing my order  with..  I just honestly  thinking at this point how lazy can the employees  be at this domino's  to not want to work I'm sadly disappointed... ( after always going through  this same process another Domino's pizza off of Stephanie St know that  this Domino's  always  does this to me...  The gentleman that works at the one off of Stephanie St was so kindly to take my order  and they delivered it faster too)"}
{"text":"Ok so I love pizza! A Lot!! And I also love Domino's pizza. Decided to order using the web interface-thingy. Never done that before. It was incredibly easy and interactive. There is even this nifty progress bar available. I ordered a pick up pizza. Large Double cheese, double pep and black olives, thin crust and well done....and it's all mine baby! *drool* it was ready for pick up by the time I arrived, cashed out and made my way home. Wow.   Hang on gotta grab the bottle of hot sauce...ok back to the review. The pizza was made exactly how I ordered it. It tastes delicious. A little more sauce than I care to have on my pizza but nothing major, I'll just opt for light sauce next time around.   Order a pizza! Now!   Happy yelpin' Friday!   Mmmmmm pizzzzaaaa!"}
{"text":"This place is the WORST. I have ordered from there twice now, and on both occasions it took 2 hours to get my good, and it was ice cold both times. Avoid this place like the plague."}
{"text":"I haven't had Domino's in a long time until a few months ago when I ordered from here. I certainly hadn't had Domjno's since they made all their recipe changes.  I've ordered about three times now and each time has been fairly consistent. It's really close to me so I just do carry-out. Sorry, I can't corroborate the delivery issues others have mentioned.  So for what it is worth, Domino's is not the best pizza in the world. It is a lot better now than what I remember. That in addition to the $7.99 3 topping carry-out deal makes this a decent value option. I've both called in my order and used the online ordering and both yielded similar results. About 15-20 minutes from placing the order until I could pick it up. Each time I've walked in, my order has been ready.  If I don't feel like spending 20 bones on a pie and want it quick, this place will work. I prefer this $7.99 option to the alternative $5 Hot-and-Ready when it comes to value."}
{"text":"It's domino's - not 5 star pizza.  But this location is one of their newly designed stores...  Don't get the pan pizza at this location - when cooked properly it is really good.  But they cannot cook it properly here - you end up with a soggy mess with raw dough in the middle.  Tried 3 times never got it right."}
{"text":"Well I didn't even get to try quality while I was here because the service was horrible. My friend and I decided to get a pizza at around 11pm. So we came here. Lobby was closed and we order from the walk up window. The lady \"helping\" people out that night was so rude that after I ordered I decided to cancel my order. She basically threw my money back at me without a single word.   Update**  Dominos staff emailed me to correct the problem. Then the store supervisor, John, called me and apologized. He then offered me a free meal for the trouble I went through with the staff. He was awesome. The pizza was good dominos quality."}
{"text":"I have been meaning to leave a review for awhile now.   We ordered pizza Friday night. Typically the pizzas are very good but for some reason our pan pizza was considerably undercooked which was a little disappointing. The delivery service at this location is always fast and the drivers always friendly. I just wish our pizza had been cooked like previously."}
{"text":"This is our go to for fast pizza.  I personally am a fan of metro or villa pizza but this location is a family favorite because in the last year they have not messed up our order, it always arrives HOT so hot that you have to wait to eat it. That is a good thing. The drivers are always friendly, smile, and look presentable.   They now allow you to earn points for each order so we have earned a few free pizzas too.   I give them five stars * fast delivery * hot pizza * friendly drivers * online ordering * large menu, coupons, incentives, and price"}
{"text":"Here is an update to my previous review. I complained this issue to the Domino Pizza HQ and they contact the Store's General Manager, who promised me that when I was ready to place a new order, give me several coupons.  I turned out that when I placed new orderings, the service has not been improved a lot and there is no coupons at all.  ~"}
{"text":"Would give 0 stars if I could. Worst customer service ever. Charged me for my pizza, but ever delivered.... At all. Josh the counter guy rudest person I've ever talked to. Not my fault you work the night shift at dominos. POS."}
{"text":"We have not had Domino's because of a bad experience years ago.  We thought we'd try them again after seeing commercials saying how much they have changed and improved.  FALSE ADVERTISING right there.  We ordered on-line and ordered 3 different items, each verified by our e-mail receipt.  Each of them arrived with a major flaw.  We orderd a speciality pizza with no tomatoes, this was delivered with a TON of tomatoes, our \"chicken side\" was burnt badly that anyone who cared about their kitchen would never have let it leave the kitchen, and lastly a non-modified specialty pizza came missing a main ingredient that makes it the speciality... the fiery hiwaiian pizza came with no \"fire\" sauce.  So we have a pizza no one will eat, burt chicken that the dog will not touch, and $16 pizza lacking the specialty.  We'll continue to to go Venezia's or Bella's Pizza from here on out.  Good luck to domino's as we will never try it again."}
{"text":"Worst.  Right now my pizza is 30 minutes late.  I'm cooking and will refuse it when it gets here."}
{"text":"I used this Domino's to order pizza for my son's school. It was a delivery and I tried to prepay for the $42 order, but they said the credit card wasn't running so I told them I'd pay cash.  The delivery went out and the driver took the money and left a note thanking me VERY much. I then logged onto my account and there pending was a payment for my pizza. I called and a lady Susan said she remembered that delivery and that she'd speak to the driver, Fernando, to get my $40 back. She said she'd call me and have him drop the money off at my son's school. Never heard back, nor did I get my money back."}
{"text":"This location is very quick with our pizzas we live 5 minutes away they do a fine job at resolving any issues that ever came up they have a good thing going with the homemade pan pizza that they make for us we love it.                                               Jason at this location rocks out a pizza you go neighborhood domino's     Thank you,                The Getz Family"}
{"text":"Ordered one pizza and website claims it was supposed to be delivered at 12:36pm.  At 1:08pm we called to see if there was a problem.  \"Sorry we only have two employees.'  Pizza eventually delivered at 1:34.  Same apology.  No offer of discount or even coupon."}
{"text":"So, I was sitting in the waiting area waiting for an order for pick up. I'm tucked away in the corner playing around on my phone and I hear this young female employee practically screaming to a co-worker about how she deals drugs. She also said something to the effect that she had to start dealing harder drugs to hang out with some people. So loud to the point where the co-worker she was talking to hushes her up and let's her know that a customer was sitting in the waiting area. I get that young people making pizzas aren't the highest quality employees, but come on.  I was kind of grossed out, because it's likely that a young girl slinging drugs on the side probably isn't a stickler for hygiene and food safety.  However, and I'm not proud to admit this, I ate the pizza and wings anyway.. because well, I was hungry and fatty needs to eat.  Pizza was good and the other kid working was polite. Still probably won't be back for a while."}
{"text":"Just ordered two pan pizzas and they arrived undercooked and full of dripping grease. This is the third time. They are rushing orders, quite obviously. I will not be ordering from them again. They used to have great pizza, don't know what changed."}
{"text":"Like many other reviewers previously said, that place actually makes the driest pizza and seems to forget toppings.   I got a triple jalapeño pizza (paid for 3 toppings) but there was barely 2 slices of jalapeño peppers per slice (of a large pizza)  The pizza itself was extremely dry."}
{"text":"Great staff! this guys are rock starts and the do it with a smile"}
{"text":"Just moved to Fort Mill not too long ago and so I'm slowly adding \"the usual\" delivery places to my phone. I can't ever remember receiving the kind of personal service from a pizza delivery like I did yesterday. I spoke with \"Mary\" and explained to her that I wanted a thin and crispy pizza Artisan style. She walked me through my options and when the pizza arrived (on time) it totally exceeded my expectation. I have to admit, I wasn't sure it'd be what I wanted but it was MORE than I expected and tasted incredibly amazing!! Thank you Mary :-)"}
{"text":"Easy quick call. Had a cooooouupppoon lol and they accepted it no problem. 15 mins and it was ready. good deal"}
{"text":"After 13 hours working at the hospital today, I had my typical complaints--I'm tired, my feet hurt, I need wine, I'm starving! Per usual, I came home and made the mistake of sitting down. Whoops, we all gonna starve tonight! While mindless scrolling, I saw the 50 percent off coupon online for Dominoes. Dominoes?! My palate scoffed at the thought. Ha! My wallet had other ideas. For 24 bucks I had two huge pizzas delivered. The app said 63 min but to my amazement, the man was at my door in 25 min!!!! Unreal. And to make my dream come true, when I commented how fast he was, he said \"Well ma'am, you deserve it\"!  If I wasn't married, well...but seriously, not all heroes wear capes.   We ordered an XL extra cheese pizza for the boy. It was actually damn good. Lots of cheese, tangy sauce, and garlicky crust with a good chew to it. My choice was the chicken bacon ranch on thin crust with added mushrooms. The crust was perfectly crisp, the garlic parm sauce was yummy, and good lord they actually put a good amount of toppings on there. I really cannot believe I'm saying this...but this is my new fave pizza for delivery! Yay!"}
{"text":"Painting a room and decided to order some pizza tonight to save time. Ordered online at 5:38pm. Website said driver left with our pizza at 5:51. At 6:20 when the pizza hadn't arrived, called the store. I was told to call back in 15 min if it hadn't arrived and they'd \"take care of it\" for me. Called 20 mn later and we were told they were backed up. We asked for new pizzas and they said we'd have to come in and get them in 20 minutes.  The driver came 10 minutes later with pizzas. We told him we called the store to complain about the long time and he said the computers screwed up and didn't give the correct times. He said he had left the store a few minutes ago and the pizzas were \"relatively warm.\"  We asked what took so long and he said he had 3 pizzas to deliver in our neighborhood.  Then he said he left 30 minutes ago.  We explained we planned to pick up hot ones in the store.  He gave a big sigh of disappointment, shook his head and walked away.  Got to the store and it was utter madness.  They credited us our $2 delivery fee and handed us 2 cold and burned pizzas (pictures posted).  Can't say we'll order Domino's pizza again."}
{"text":"Every time I order from this location I end up pissed off. I ordered pizza and pasta and both were cold by the time they got to me. The store is MAYBE ten minutes from my house and it took over 30 minutes from the time the driver left for it to get to my house. I asked for no onions in my pasta and there were onions and barely any toppings. Just cold noodles. Cold, hard pizza. This review is long overdue. Worst dominos ever."}
{"text":"I requested and paid for 4 toppings! This look like cheese pizza with a piece of chicken. You can't be serious Dominos!!"}
{"text":"Literally rather eat whole grain wheat bread for a month than eat one slice of this pizza. Why are they still in business????"}
{"text":"The food was as expected, the delivery driver was friendly and I received my food very quickly!  The only reason for 3* is the fact that every time I order Blue Cheese dipping sauce, I wind up with Ranch. I hate paying, even .50, for something I didn't want."}
{"text":"I've been ordering from this Dominos for about 2 years now, and they are always very quick and the delivery drivers are 9/10 very polite. Food is always hot and fresh. No complaints as of yet. My favorite is the Mango Habenero Wings."}
{"text":"Ordered our pizza and it was delivered fast and was hot but.........we ordered half ham and the other half pepperoni but whoever made it obviously can't read as they put pineapple on it instead of pepperoni! My husband calls to tell them they gave us the wrong pizza and the girl actually asked if we wanted a new Pizza! Seriously? Like we want to eat a pineapple pizza instead of pepperoni? Than she puts my husband on hold for over 5 minutes for whatever reason. This time the Pizza took 50 minutes to get to our house and we live 1/4 mile from Domino's. No apology or credit given for their mistake except them expecting us to eat the mistake Pizza. Won't be ordering from them again."}
{"text":"I visited this location on Feb.  11, 2015.  I found the staff and manager to be competent and courteous.  There was a small discrepancy with the price of one of the items on the menu and what they charged me.  When I brought it to the Manager's attention he apologized and made the correction immediately."}
{"text":"Took close to two hours for delivery.  Multiple phone calls.  Food taste was bad.  pizza was lukewarm.  Overall taste was bad.  Never ordering again!"}
{"text":"I've eaten there a few times in the last month.  The folks that work there are pleasant, and I usually wait for my food in the store...  Just saw an act of kindness at this store that gives me hope in humanity.  Rather than let food go to waste, they shared it with somebody who was down on his luck and couldn't afford it... Obviously I know that they are a business and that they can't give food away all the time.. But this food would have been tossed and this person really needed it... So kudos to team here!"}
{"text":"Slowest delivery I've ever seen. Food is good but usually only luke warm. I'm about 10 minutes from their location but it seems to take 45 minutes to get here and that's not from when the order went in, it's from when the tracker says it's out for delivery."}
{"text":"Ok, so I typically never go the corporate restaurant route and here in Sunnyslope we have a couple of really awesome pizza places......so why did I eat here?  Well, my grandmother (who lives in VA) is practically obsessed with Dominos Pizza.  She raves about it constantly and so I went here to get her a gift card for Christmas.  When I was a kid, I hated Dominos, I thought it was awful.  I had heard they improved and I was already there so I figured why not.  I got a pepperoni pizza, thin crust.  It was decent.  Nothing to write home about, but it was decent.  The customer service here is great btw, so I definitely endorse it, if you're looking for corporate."}
{"text":"I called the first time & I was immediately put on hold, 10 minutes later no one came back on the phone. I hung up & called right back, I told the guy that answered the lengthy amount of time that I had been on hold for in my previous call, he asked for my address then put me on hold AGAIN. He came back to tell me that they don't deliver to my address & that he couldn't assist me in which Dominos does deliver to my address. The lack of customer service at this store is just sad! They need to work on training their employees to be helpful & actually nice to their customers."}
{"text":"They've given my family the wrong order multiple times within the last 6 months. I try to keep my orders simple but they still manage to screw up. Very frustrating I'll be sticking with #1 brothers from now on."}
{"text":"July 11th 2015 purchase  ETA per email was 21-30 minutes.   After 50 minutes I called the store and was told by Marcus that the pizza was still there and was offered a free soda. No explanation as to why there was such a delay was provided, but Marcus assured that the pizza would be \"hot and fresh\".  It arrived 1 hour later (ordered at 1:45, arrived at 2:45) and was lukewarm and soggy.   I don't recommend ordering from this location."}
{"text":"I put \"diced tomatoes\" as a topping so they put tomato sauce on top of my pizza. That's a poor excuse for what the topping is. Same was done with the pasta. I understand it's dominos but but I'm not asking a lot. I'd rather not even have the topping if that's the \"diced tomatoes\"."}
{"text":"I wish I could give few than one star, I called ordered pizza on our way home from the state fair. The coupon did not have a coupon code so they decided to NOT MAKE MY ORDER unti I arrived. We I arrived they acted like I hadn't called and then I said and showed them my coupon. We were hungry and tired and talked to manager. She was snotty and rude."}
{"text":"Last time we ordered it toke over a hour and thirty minutes.... placed a order tonight and still haven't received it an hour later but it said 30-40 minute wait time. Makes me also wonder how long my food sits out. This location is just very slow... always."}
{"text":"They really suck.They do not offer parm. cheese, so when we order from them we have to use extra packets we have from REAL pizza places. Also twice have ordered from local store, just to go there and order was lost or not there. Jerk at store asked if we had ordered from Pizza Hut. We probably would have had food by now if we did.  We stick w/ Papa for chain pizza delivery."}
{"text":"If 0 stars were possible that's what I'd give them. Horrible service. They refused to deliver to my door after I'd ordered delivery from them several times before. I gave up and canceled the order. Last time I ordered from them, the delivery said it was out for over 30 minutes (I live 2 blocks away) and it was cold when I got it."}
{"text":"One star is a little harsh, so mistakes happen Dominos is the best factory pizza place period .. I have never paid 20 plus for pizza from there,5.99 carry out ! enough said.."}
{"text":"Everything I have ordered from this Domino's has been awesome. The staff is blessed with bright and bubbly personalities and my orders get here before they leave Domino's. Okay maybe not that fast but fast. The order I just received was perfect as usual and delivered by the best looking pizza girl ever. Highly recommended"}
{"text":"The food is good,and the service is pretty friendly.They don't always get it exactly correct though.They are pretty prompt,and delivery quickly. they are good at updating their process.We have had service from Chris,Dustin,and Vladamir."}
{"text":"Really disappointed.. I always come here with my gf when we crave pizza and the one time I come in to order and wait for my pizza I saw one of the workers literally scratch his arm... all the way to his armpit and scoop up the cheese and brush it towards the container.. literally grossed me out (USE GLOVES) smh!"}
{"text":"Just look at the this pasta ... really ? Cmon   Literally cold, hard... so disappointed. I get it you don't specialize in pasta but how can the \"preparer\" pre this to be sent out to delivery."}
{"text":"We are regular customers.  Pizzas are always fresh and good, drivers are nice and quick.  Our favorite pizza delivery place!"}
{"text":"First time ordering, ordered pasta and pizza. Finally arrived and pasta was incorrect. When I asked to driver to take it back and refund my money or to bring me a new order, he told me he didn't want to take the pasta back and I could just call the store and they would credit me for next time, and just call and order a new pasta. He was terribly inconvenienced that they incorrectly made my order and let me know he was not going to help me but was more than willing to keep my tip.   Stay away from here and just order from someplace else. It's not worth the hassle for subpar pizza."}
{"text":"First of all if u order delivery with a card they will make you show it at the door.  So i had 2 dudes show up with pizza at my house questioning who I am. I had a cash tip in hand.  I deff want my tip back. So I have to leave 2 strangers at my door, I feel unsafe now.  I didn't even get my parmesan packets I ordered. This was an afternoon delivery. They deff care about the company before the customers.  Too worried about seeing my actual card than delivering what I actually ordered.  Papa John's is better anyways."}
{"text":"Very slow. They give you a time frame and then take 20-30 minutes longer. Also when you call they don't care they just tell you \"it's out for delivery.\" Well then why give a time frame if you can't stick to that. Poor service."}
{"text":"I ordered one of the new speciality pizzas from this location a couple of nights ago.   I love ordering Domino's via their website because it tells me who is making the pizza (better to have a place to focus my rage if my pizza is not correctly).   Luckly, I did not have anything to be upset about.   The pizza was finished promptly and was cooked to my specifications (no diced tomatoes on my baja chicken/bacon/ranch).     I opted to pick up the pizza instead of delivery and the employees were friendly and quick to attend to my order.  Will definately use again for those day(s) I am lazy and don't want to eat out (yes I see ordering pizza and taking it home and sitting on my couch in my boxers sleazily throwing pizza into my mouth while my dogs fight for scraps as not eating out)."}
{"text":"I ordered a large pizza for carryout. Went to pick it up and after they swiped my card I was told they gave my pizza to someone else and it will be a 20 minute wait while they make another. Which completely negates the point of calling ahead. But I was offered a comp on my 2 liter of soda ! I was in middle of watching the NBA Finals so I told them to reverse the charge and I walked out.   And the guy who got my pizza got screwed too unless he wanted half pineapple and bacon, half sausage & mushrooms."}
{"text":"Ok so where to start? We ordered a bunch of food and made sure to order enough sauce to go with it 2 marinara 2 ranch and 2 blu cheese. The pizza arrives in great time. However, the bottom pizza was crushed so the toppings for the pizza was partially on the top of the box, the only sauce we got was 1 marinara, and when I called to tell them all they said was that they could send the driver back out with the sauce. The poor delivery guy would end up spending his whole tip making another trip out here. And the manager wouldn't even come to the phone and talk to me. Worst service followed by the worst customer service EVER!"}
{"text":"WOW worst service possible! I waited an hour before calling to cancel and get a refund on my order. According to the tracker, it had already been sitting out for 45 minutes?!?"}
{"text":"Took my kids here to get them some pizzas. We ordered prior to coming in and had to wait for 45 mins. My girlfriend asked 3 times about the pizzas. Watched multiple people come and go, then the guy says that our order was taken by a driver by mistake. They had the nerve to ask us to wait again. And wanted to offer a my girlfriend a soda after making us wait. Incompetent workers just wanting to play at work and not pay attention. So we waited 45 mins for some 15 minute Pizzas. Yeah I'm ok on this place. We just went to Little Caesar's down the street like we should've in the beginning. You earned a 1 star for the lack of service you provided. Now somewhere there is someone else who got the wrong order as well so it was a lose/lose for all. I'll bet you didn't think I would make her get that money back but that was exactly what I did. Also took the time to connect to yelp to make this review. Please don't contact me trying to give me coupons either. We don't want that."}
{"text":"Didn't answer the phone when I called so I placed the order online. They took 30 mins to even put the stuff in the oven. When delivered, the driver made me come outside in the cold to his car. Waiving me out his window to come to his car after he pulled up. Claiming the hotel wouldn't let him in, I said ok, just hurry up and let me sign my receipt. I regret tipping him. Also the worst prepared pasta bread bowls I've ever got from Dominos. Try a different location. This one sucked."}
{"text":"OKAY SO i ORDERED A VEGITARIAN PIZZA TO BE PICKED UP IN 15 MI. NO PROBLEM SO I DROVE TO PICK IT UP AND WHEN i WENT TO PAY FOR THE PIZZA WITH MY CARD THE MACHINE ACTUALLY ASKED ME TO GIVE A TIP OF 10%-30% WHICH REALLY SURPRISED ME, AND A TIP FOR WHAT??? THEY DIDNT DO ANYTHING OUT OF THE ORDINARY BUT THERE JOB THAT THEY ARE GETTING PAID FOR!! I work in customer service cutting hair for a living and we dont even ask for that tip when we are done cutting there hair and I get paid hourly. Oh but I still tipped anyway cuz what goes around comes around! So I get home after driving there to pick up my pizza and there is no veggies in my vegitatian pizza so I called to speak to the manager to complain about not getting any vegies on my vegetarian pizza and all he did was get very defensive with me and I told him that I have ordered many veggie pizzas before from dominoes on eastern and horizon ridge and my pizza was always full of veggies so he just proceeded to argue with me and raised his voice at me and I did not deserve to be talked to in the manner that he was speaking to me. Don't ever go there, they don't give you what you ordered and they still ask for a tip!! The customer service is horrible!!!"}
{"text":"This is a great location - we order from here 2 or 3 times a month, sometimes more, and it's REALLY good. Online ordering is super easy, friendly staff, fast delivery, the food has great flavor, and their customer service is top-notch; very responsive and helpful.   April, you and your crew over rock. For realz.  The Memphis BBQ chicken pizza and lava cakes are addictive, and we've nearly had a cage match or two over who gets the last piece of spinach and feta stuffed cheesy bread. Of course I always win, because I am Almighty Mom. 'Nuff said.  If you're the kind of person that calls a pizza a pizza and not a pie, you'll love what you get.  If you're a pizza aficionado that \"rolls your own dough\" from time to time - try it. You'll like it. Just pay cash. Nobody has to know."}
{"text":"Worst dominos yet! Placed an order at 12:45 and it said it was being prepped by Loren. Then it said it was cancelled. I called and Loren said they got the order and was making it. Well my pizza never came and they never called me back! What the fuck! Just lost and entire group of people because of that! I would never recommend them to anyone!"}
{"text":"Pizza was great! Young lady manning the store was Fantastic! She was extremely personable, friendly and efficient! Plus she makes a great Pizza! Will definitely be back! Fresh & Hot Pizza, done quickly!"}
{"text":"If you look at the same reviews below me they too experienced what I have. Either 1 undercooked food, or 2 food poisoning. In my case it was definitely food poisoning. I ate pizza here last night and woke up to vomiting and have to go to the bathroom every second now. This is ridiculous."}
{"text":"The pizza I ordered was dry very little sauce & little to no cheese it was also dry it didn't taste fresh or warm I usually don't have a problem with dominos never have till today I also ordered wings which was great by the way just wish they were a lil bigger the staff was friendly but the pizza wasn't good"}
{"text":"The pizza from this location is consistently delicious, but I am writing this review because they left out our dipping sauce. The delivery guy apologized and let us know how to make sure we get it in the future, and then without us asking him, he went back to the store and came back to drop off our sauce. That is gold star service. Thanks Dominos!"}
{"text":"This review is based on the crummy service I received in the past and most recently the pizza was very sloppy. I'm adding a pic of half a pizza. Everyone was hungry so I couldn't get a pic of the full pic but you can see that the pizza was a mess.  Fortunately, it tasted good but people \"eat with their eyes\" so I would prefer the pizza to look normal. Additionally, the crust didn't have the normal garlic flavor on the edge of the crust. I'll keep eating their pizza b/c their cheap and pretty good."}
{"text":"Dominos is my favorite chain restaurant for pizza!  I like that they rolled back the prices. Pizza is no longer twice as much on weekends.  That adult boutique is not next door any longer, thank goodness. Dominos great pizza, great prices!"}
{"text":"Lousy customer service. My order my expected to take 20-30 minutes. After an hour, I \"tracked\" my order as the \"tracker\" stated that my pizza had been delivered. I called the store and was told that the driver couldn't find my house. She supposedly even called. No pizza. No phone call. Not even an apology or an attempt to make things right."}
{"text":"Like the food when they have it available...twice no Caesars Chix and tonight no Carbonera"}
{"text":"Awesome pizza every time. It's the only  place in town that i can get spinach on my pizza yea"}
{"text":"If you're looking for a cheap and quick meal this is definitely it just that cheap and quick. If you're looking for New York style, or anything fancy this is not for you. I've used the app a few times when the kids want a pizza and that is one thing I love. It tells you the second they see your order, put it in the oven and when it's out for delivery. This option saves a lot of time wondering when your food is on its way. Taste is ok, but nothing really stands out to me."}
{"text":"Worst dominos I ever have been to . It wasnt dominos it was this specific one. They were so rude to me I will never be coming back . I ended up just leaving my pizza and went to pizza hut."}
{"text":"My online order was received at 5:14 p. m., and the site stated it should arrive in 26-29 minutes.  Then it said that it was Quality Checked at 5:39, even giving me the name of the person.  At 6:01 I called the store to ask about the status of my order and was told \"Um, sir, I have a driver taking that out right now.\".  I'm not a rocket surgeon, but I can do simple math, and my pizza shouldn't need 22 minutes of \"Quality Checking\".  Looks like I'll be calling Pizza Hut from now on....F U Domino's."}
{"text":"This was my second order with them and both times the pizza was so warm, fresh and yummy.  If you order wings, make sure to get them try and add the sauce on yourself when they arrive or they will be all wet not so tasty.  The delivery was speed was incredible almost like the had the pizza done before I ordered.  Our delivery person Jason was kind, respectful and just a nice guy!  Hope you get him. Jim K."}
{"text":"I have been on the Internet since before it was common to have one. I am a loyal dominos customer -- I love the crust and the chocolate lava takes, and there's just something about it that is irresistible. Yet I decided to try the gluten \"free\"/less gluten crust because my advisors tell me I should eat less gluten. I was unable to apply the coupon. The site didn't tell me why. It was only a few dollars difference so I called Dominos and I asked for them to apply the coupon. They did not do it because the gluten free wasn't 12-inch -- despite the fact that the gluten free only comes in 10-inch."}
{"text":"Our food came way faster than any of us expected. It was literally here within 20-25 minutes of placing an online order. Also- after ordering online and omitting cheese from a specialty pizza, an employee called just to confirm the order was accurate. Better customer service than ever expected. Food was hot, fresh, and very fast!"}
{"text":"I had  made an order from my previous records. I didn't realize that it was my works address, that was my mistake but as soo as I realize I called and they told me that they had canceled my order. I will get my money back in 5-10 business days. I didn't canceled I didn't received a call which I think its very bad for customer service."}
{"text":"Management needs to change. The people who run the restaurant are giving a bad name to Dominos. They are extremely rude and unprofessional.   I have experienced this a few times. The last time I had a bad experience, was when I ordered 2 pizzas with a deal and got a coke. But the lady at the counter forgot to give us the coke. I had split the bill with a friend and when my friend went back to the store (after 2 minutes or less) they acted like they did not remember us and did not remember the deal or the fact that we split the bill just a few minutes back. A young guy who claims to be the manager said that it was not possible for him to honor the deal as he thought that my friend was lying. In the end he said he just did not want to create a scene but my friend kept telling that the manager was not doing a favor and just looking at the receipts would let him know that they forgot to give us the coke. He was extremely rude and refused to comply , he just wanted to make it look like he was giving us a coke as a favor.   I think this manager should be fired and some one more matured and customer friendly should be hired."}
{"text":"I decided to give Domino's another try the driver did not bring two out of four items he acted like it wasn't his fault whose fault would it be then?"}
{"text":"The Dominos tracker said my pizza left the store at 2:10 p.m. I live about 4 minutes away and it took the driver 29 minutes to get here he obviously made other stops and my pizza was cold by the time it arrived"}
{"text":"Seriously I would give them a BIG FAT ZERO rating. The idiots screwed up the order. Then they were late. And there was no apology and she still claimed she had done nothing wrong. When I said that Dominos has 30 minute delivery or free pizza, she claimed its 45 minutes!!!!!!! A COMPLETE LIAR! Plus she wondered if I knew how to order pizzas? God they are terrible!!! Do not order from them. Plus their English is very very poor."}
{"text":"I waited over 2 hours for my delivery, the delay was a festival in the town center. You'd think that they would notify of the delay, but it took me getting so irritated that I called. The manager was acting like their was nothing he could do and it wasn't his fault. In situations where you know that there is going to be a delay you should plan ahead of time, and figure out how to let customers know certain services are going to be unavailable. If this is done, you won't have people like me waiting 2 hours for food that hasn't shown up. The Strongsville Domino's is much more preferable."}
{"text":"Got order wrong 3 times, took over 45 minutes to get right as a carry out order. employees seem to be cross eyed"}
{"text":"First off the guy who took my order didn't know what online specials they had and proceeded to tell me that the online offer they had didn't exist. I ordered at 6:45pm and they said my pizza would be ready in 15 min. I showed up at 7:05, paid and waited. At 7:15 I was told my pizzas needed to me made and offered me a 2 liter of soda. I asked for my money to be refunded and went to Pizza Hut. Horrible service!! Don't eat here total chaos, who's in charge here..."}
{"text":"Today is Thanksgiving and the issue is that we have to work. So we needed to get something to eat. Most places are closed. We called a few places and reaction was so sad. So called Domino's and it was great, they are open. We had them deliver the pizza to us. We got the mushroom pizza and Hawaiian. On top we ordered some wings but we said BBQ and it comes in as hot spicy wings. Oh well.   Overall it was good.  Can't complain when you are desperate for food.  Came in very hot and fresh.  They didn't give a receipt for expense claim. But we called and they came back to deliver the receipt, this is awesome."}
{"text":"Not sure if I am hungry or what but the pizza here are pretty good. We ordered a pizza with lots of topping and had it delivered to us. It came in hot and fresh. Colleague called and ordered it by phone.   I like their pizza."}
{"text":"Amazing service!   Although the quality of the taste of the pizza was just ok. The crust is a bit dry, but It's totally a great value for what you pay. I especially loved that there was an option to \"go light\" on a topping.   Their digital tracking and screens inside the store is also fantastic."}
{"text":"I would give them zero. My pizza cost me 19 DOLLARS (I ordered a medium pan with xtra cheese, mushrooms, and pepperoni).   pizza was delivered quickly but it was raw. Literally pizza dough. Thank you dominoes."}
{"text":"The food regularly arrives cold and has missing items. This has to be the absolute worst Domino's I've ever had the displeasure of eating. If you order drinks or sauces, best believe they won't show up. Management insists you either take a credit for \"next time\" (which never ended up happening) or come to the store to pick up the items that they forgot! ( which defeats the purpose of delivery!) I avoid this pizza place at all costs. There are plenty of better locally owned pizza places nearby."}
{"text":"I don't care about Domino's pizza. I've always hated it. I came here because I was filling up my water jug at the water mill located in the same parking lot. Mon-Wed they have a carry-out special: 1 large pizza with 3 toppings for $7.99. Pizza was ready in 15 min. It wasn't bad but it's not going to make Domino's my first choice either.  The staff at this location are really nice. They all welcomed me when I walked through the door. No complaints there."}
{"text":"This place is a joke. I don't normally order from them since every time I do there is issue most of the time. Well yet again I place an order online, and I order extra dipping sauces and get charged for them rightfully so. But when they don't get delivered and then I get push back from the driver. I even show them my order showing what I ordered he then apologizes and says he will be back in 10 minutes with my sauces. 45 minutes later after everyone has eaten and the food is gone I get a knock on the door and it's the driver with the sauces I no have an use for. This place is a joke! If you are in the area go to Barros on 24th St and Baseline, save yourself the headache."}
{"text":"I'm not a huge fan of franchise pizza companies but not much to choose from for delivery in this area.  This review is more for how fast their delivery is and the customer service.  Usually says 30 minutes or so to get here and its always here in 15 to 20 and the order is always right.  Sadly nowadays that's hard to find so figured I would throw a good review their way for it."}
{"text":"Well this used to be my favorite place but went last night and picked up two pizzas on February 5th! Me and my kids are sick the pizza was bad we were up all night! Really pisses me off and that place has changed a lot so I will never go back and I'll make sure to let everybody never to go back"}
{"text":"Just as craptastic as the one in Montreal that I used. Low-quality \"cheese\" that comes off the pizza by the time it arrives, just BAD. Avoid Domino's in Canada. Go to the US for the real thing. Never again."}
{"text":"I don't know why I keep ordering from here. Probably because I just like the taste of Domino's. But this place sucks. Every single time I have ordered a pizza from them in the two and a half years I've been living in Montreal, the cheese is hard and like plastic by the time it gets to me. I don't know if it goes bad during delivery or if it's just made poorly but it sucks, period. Every so often I need my Domino's fix but by the time I'm done with the pizza pie, I'm pulling the cheese off because it's already begging to be pulled off on its own. Montreal. Pizza. Sucks. They can't even do Domino's right."}
{"text":"Pizza toke over 1 hour and 20 min guy in the phone didn't help much needs more training and to top all that off messed up my order would not recommend  here and will not be coming back"}
{"text":"We used to be regulars of Domino's, until this location opened. As others have stated, despite being closer they are incredibly slow to deliver- at times over an hour. Today, their app said our pizza was deliverd and we never received it. When we called the store, we were told it was \"on the way.\" We then got a call, from the store, from the delivery girl saying she was on the road. Over an hour later, we finally received our pizza. They need some training over there. Maybe try the store on trop/pecos. The boxes were also covered in grease."}
{"text":"The service was absolutely horrendous. I walked in to pick up my 2 sandwiches which were ready and sitting out. The order was wrong on the check in screen which I tried to get the attention of the woman and man who were chatting with each other. Finally I spoke loudly to get their attention. She said order was fine and screen was wrong and to continue. Then I go to pay and sit there and wait for 10 more mins. When I'm in a hurry. By the time I got to eat the subs they were cold and I got ignored the whole time there..."}
{"text":"I'm not writing this review for the pizza, it's actually about the service. I had ordered my food over the phone and the employee was very nice. He said that it would be about 35-45 minutes and it would be here. However, l ended up waiting close to 90 minutes for my food to come. I'm not mad about the wait because I knew Domino's was super busy and there isn't much they can do when there are a bunch of orders. I had called the place to confirm that my food was still going to be delivered and the manager was very apologetic and explained that there were only 2 drivers to handle all of the orders. I just wish that the employee would have given me a better estimated time of how long I would wait, if he knew the place was super busy. Again, I'm not mad about this, this post is mostly to let everyone else know that you'll probably end up waiting a whole lot longer than you anticipated."}
{"text":"If you have nothing better do to than to sit on hold and listen to an endless commercial for the DOMINO'S APP... and how to use it.... call them!   After being on hold forever and listening to their ad for their app.... I finally hung up... call Streets of New York.... talked to a human being and had three pizzas delivered 45 minutes later."}
{"text":"I had a very bad experience with the manager at the Valley View location, so the very accommodating District Manager gave me a credit for this spot.   I ordered the food over the phone, and the manager was helpful and polite.  We showed up 15 minutes later and the food was hot and ready to go. I used the last of my credit to get some sodas and the manager even rounded one up and gave it to me. Wow!  Too bad this location doesn't deliver to my area, because they were so much better at everything!!!!  Note: Thanks Dominoes for making a wrong, right. I haven't lost faith in you altogether, just only one store."}
{"text":"Experience: ordered some pasta and some soda online for delivery. It was a Wed night @ 8:30 pm.   Service:  so the order did not take long to arrive, but when I opened the pastas, both of them were made incorrect. This blows my mind, since it was made online, so not much room for interpretation.  When I called a lady answered, and I told her both of my pastas were made incorrectly, she asked me what I ordered, and I told her that I placed the order online, so it was in black and white, but yet they were still wrong. As I started to tell her the mistakes, she cut me off and told me she had a new person starting, and there was no call for that, and she would have them remade and sent out immediately, thank you very much...but before I could even respond to find out what had her so upset, she hung up!!!!!   Now, I was both irritated AND offended. I couldn't believe she hung up on me. I assume this person who is new and making all the mistakes has her on edge, but I'm the customer and this shouldn't be my problem.  Anyway, so I tried to call back to get her name, so I could call her boss the next day, but she answered the phone by saying curtly without a breath...\"Ma'am, your order is on the way, and sorry for mistake, and thank you\" and then hung up again!  Wow!!!  So, then I decided there is no way in hell, I'm eating whatever this chic is spitting in, so I called back again to try and ask for a refund, but again, she answered saying that \"ma'am your order is on the way to stop calling\", so I tried to talk over her and said \"but I want a refund, not the order\", and she said, \"He's on the way\" and hung up.  So, I called back again, and tried to ask for her name, and make sure she was sending a refund and not more pasta.  She did not let me get in a word again, but I did hear her say the driver was returning with my money and then she hung up on me again.  Finally the last time I called, she answered somewhat politely, and said \"yes ma'am?\" And I told her all I wanted was her name. \"She informed me I didn't need her name, and it was ridiculous how many times I called, and it was harassment, and I was being rude\" and surprise, surprise...she hung up on me again!  The funniest part was when she said I was being rude.  I'm assuming she is a manager, and it just blows my mind that she thought the way she was treating me was appropriate....even if she thinks I was being inappropriate by saying the order was in black and white. I only said this so she wouldn't think it was my miscommunication on a phone order. Also, I wouldn't have to call five times, if you would have just let me speak, even the first time.  I sure hope they record those phone calls!!!!!   They will be able to see how irrational she was behaving.  I will be contacting management tomorrow, of course.  BTW, the driver Daniel, was very professional when he returned and gave me my money back. Too bad he wasn't the manager working!  Whoever this nameless manager is, she needs to learn a little professionalism from her employees.   Good: couldn't tell you...returned it!   Overall:  I sure hope whomever I talk to in the chain will have a little more professionalism than this lady did. We order from this spot about once or twice a month, and the manager tomorrow will completely determine if I switch to Pizza Hut or Papa Johns, or return again only when I am sure she is not on duty though. Wouldn't ever be able to trust her with my food, when she goes off that hard over nothing. I know I was irritated, but it's not like I was abusive and called her names or cursed at her. I probably should have, then her irrational behavior might have been justified. But either way, dealing with unhappy customers is part of their job. I bet they even have training on it. She must have missed that class.  Anyway, hope you have better luck than we did, and you don't have to deal with such outrageous behavior from someone in their customer service.   Note...I was reading another review of this place and saw someone else had issues with this store \"hanging up on them\". Is this standard practice for this store?  If so, is this what dominoes is teaching how to deal with customers?? I sure hope not, but that will make my decision of return business pretty simple."}
{"text":"Never again, slap me if I consider ordering from the place again. We have been ordering pizza's no problems.. customer service weekday afternoons was great. The food was pretty good too.  Well tonight I had a craving for the Lava Cake and some Parmesan Bread Bites to go along with our dinner. I placed the order online, and ordered Marinara Sauce to go along with the Bread.   I picked up the order, got home, they forgot my Marinara Sauce.. No worries 75 cents lost. We sat down to dinner the Parmesan Bread was dry they forgot the Garlic .. ugh.. oh well.  We finish dinner, break out the lava cake, only to be greeted by to hockey pucks, burned like charcoal and tasted like charcoal. OMG they were crispy critters.   Since the store is just a few blocks from home, I took a ride and wanted to return the cake and get a refund for my Marinara Sauce.  The person at the counter was rude and dismissive. I showed him the cake he said oh well that is how it is served. I said I didnt get my Marinara Sauce as well. Reply \" too bad \" .. I think he was hoping I would leave.. Finally I asked for the Manager.. After 15 minutes of being totally ignored, no other customers in the store.. I raised my voice. \" is there a Manager here\" still ignored .. finaly 5 minutes later someone appeared at the counter, I asked if he was the manager said he was one of them.. I explained my problem. Again dismissive no I am sorry  or can I make you another.. Finally someone else appeared, more rude than the others, I am guessing he is the real manager. He looked at the cake, made excuses, I ordered it hours ago so that is why the cake was hard and burned. Said he would not apologize, and said I didnt order Marinara Sauce, accusing me of trying to steal 75 cents. I paid for the sauce its on my reciept.. finally he told the other  person give her a refund and BLOCK HER PHONE.. Really? Do you think I will be ordering anything from Domonio's ever again? NOT .."}
{"text":"This is horrible! Said it left at 629 landed at 653. Burnt and cold, wth?   Waited over 4 minutes on hold to talk to Cesar the manager. Told him how burnt the pizza is and it was cold when landed. Told him I wasn't paying.. Could have offered a new one to make it good but he didn't.   Sad- I expected more from dominos!   Zero stars would have been except able!"}
{"text":"95% of the time everything is awesome. 5% of the time they take care of minor mistakes. Drivers are friendly during delivery, counter employees are nice, but my favorite is the online order experience. I just wish that Domino's wasn't the best pizza in the area. However, dominos is the best pizza in the Amherst, oh area."}
{"text":"Great pizza, fast delivery, super nice delivery guy! Delivered to Railroad Pass Hotel, straight to the room which was nice."}
{"text":"Went there to order a to go pizza at 11:12 pm. It says they closed at 12am online. When we got there they said,\" we are close.\"  How lazy!"}
{"text":"We've ordered from here many times over the two years we've lived in the area, and it's always what you would expect from a chain pizza place- not super amazing, but decent, inexpensive, and filling. The service and employees is another story.  We ordered our usual last Friday,  11/14/14, and opted for pick up. My husband picked up, and paid by debit. Today,  while going over our bank statement from the previous week I noticed that we were either overcharged, which isn't likely, as my husband knew the total, or someone added a charge after he left. For good service we have no problem leaving a generous tip,  but at this particular location we always encounter rude, disinterested customer service. I've emailed customer service in hopes that a simple mistake was made, and the situation can be remedied."}
{"text":"This Domino's doesn't meet the minimum criteria for the brand.  Order pizza and they say it will take 45 to 55 minutes for it to be delivered.  I concede and accept this time frame, this isn't the problem.  The pizza shows up over two and half hours after I ordered it.  This is a problem.  It gets worse!  The pizza is luke warm, gross.  My friend still tipped the delivery guy and we mention how late the pizza is.  He is the only person to ever apologize.  It isn't his fault they couldn't crank out the pizza in less than hours.  But he did deliver a luke warm pizza.  He got a tip but looking back he shouldn't have.  We could have made other arrangements had we been notified an upper limit of 55 minutes was only about one third of the time it would actually take.  I called the next day because it was already midnight when we got the pizza.  I should have saved both pizzas and called that same night.  Drunk housemate came home and ate some of the pizza.  This was rude and I guess it cost me a total refund.  Manny did finally agree to give me a free pizza if I come and pick one up.  If the pizzas had come hot then there may have been some wiggle room on a complete refund and then some being appropriate.  Missing the timeliness deadline by 100 or so minutes for a pizza that takes 7 minutes to make is horrible.  Letting the 7 minute pizza languish until it is almost cold and then delivering it or delivering it do slowly it gets cold is unacceptable.  Someone knew the moment that left the door they weren't doing what is reasonable.  It was an attempt to get away with doing a horrible job.  There won't be a next time.  Make sure you open the box and check your n pizza for heat and toppings before you pay.  I don't mind cold pizza, I just don't expect that is the way Domino's would deliver it.  I also like to eat hot pizza and save cold pizza for the next day."}
{"text":"Got carry out 2 weeks in a row.  Both times, the pizza was great, service was great, hot, fresh and on time.  Definitely way better than they used to be."}
{"text":"Shame on them. An hour late and no apology for cold pizza. Lose the franchise, you're not worthy."}
{"text":"Last Friday, I ordered 2 pizzas from this location for a coworker and I.  Both pizzas arrived barely warm to the touch with maybe 2 tablespoons of marinara sauce.  This is the second time.  Never again."}
{"text":"I selected cash payment upon delivery, but was still charged on my card. Had to dispute with the bank, even though Dominos was who actually made the mistake. Delivery driver was, admittedly, extremely prompt and very polite, fault seems to be the functioning of the app and the fact that a store manager has very little power to help correct an issue caused by the ordering app."}
{"text":"Went in and ordered. Took a little under ten minutes to get super fresh and super hot pizzas. The new garlic butter on the crust is excellent."}
{"text":"I ordered pizza to my hotel room. It took an hour to get there. After they get there, they inform me that I have to walk out to the Valet to get my pizza because they can't deliver to my room   That's fine, but if that's the case, why are you asking me for my room number? That would lead me to believe that u can deliver to my room.   So I walk all the way out to the valet, The delivery guy is nowhere in site. I figured he would be in a Dominos car or he would be in uniform etc. I guess the driver didnt think it was important to tell me he was sitting in a non descript generic non company car. Am i supposed to guess which one of a dozen cars you are sitting in?  Use some com mon sense.  Totally Ridiculous. This is a business start managing it like one."}
{"text":"I have ordered from here because of convince. It has been twice now I have paid for extra cheese and they give you less! Quality Dominos, this time I had no extra cheese and it was burnt! Talking to the manager last time thought this wouldn't happen again. Maybe time for new management Bonanza location!"}
{"text":"Worst dominos ever. No sauce on the pizza. Barley any sausage and none of the butter garlic on the crust, so it tastes like pre 2008 cardboard dominos.   Thank you for my worst dominos experience ever.   And I used to work for one! Truly sad."}
{"text":"No, it ain't the local good stuff, but it's my go to for corporate pizza. The mobile app makes ordering a breeze, and delivery is very quick. They usually have some pretty good coupons floating around too.   During their half off pizza week, I ordered the salami artisan pizza and cheesy bread. The artisan pizza was worlds better than their normal cardboard tasting stuff. A thin crust, white sauce, and roasted veggies on top made this a big winner in my book.   I may or may not have OD'd on cheesy bread.   If you want something quick and easy, try this place out!!"}
{"text":"DO NOT ORDER FROM THIS DOMINOS. I put an order in at 10:35 pm using the Domino's app, @ 11:30 I tried calling the branch, the Deer Valley location. Check out what they did, I called them at exactly 11:32pm on 6/21/2018, I was placed on hold so I had my phone on speaker because I was watching a movie, after being on hold for over 30 minutes, someone at 12:05 am picks up the phone from the hook and hangs up without a word. I tried calling back but lol was sent to answering machine because it was passed midnight so Domino's was officially closed. AT 12:25am I get a ring at my door which ends up waking up my 4 month old baby.  F$*k this place, unprofessional....."}
{"text":"Great place. Order or pick up, always what I ask for.  I like to order online so I can see exactly when my pizza is getting to my house."}
{"text":"This Dominoes is the closest one to my house and I always find myself coming here to satisfy my pizza cravings (which occur almost weekly...).  They always have a carry-out special which is $7.99 for a large 1-topping.  The staff here are very quick and efficient; I have never had any issues with my online or walk-in orders.  This Dominoes is located in a very hidden plaza to the side of a bridge so parking is never an issue; however, it is a takeout only location and offer no tables."}
{"text":"I love dominos and how efficient they are when you order through their website. You can always know when you are getting your pizza.   I ordered chicken alfredo with bacon and it was amazing.   Will order again from this location. Thanks Lesley!"}
{"text":"rude service. cold food. disgusting. they always mess up.  we will never support any dominos again"}
{"text":"Worst pizza the sauce is sweet and they put some sugary stuff on the crust now. No thanks!!!!"}
{"text":"We love them! Great pizza and great service! We have become very loyal customers. I really don't order from anyone else. Keep up the great service!"}
{"text":"Put me on hold and I guess forgot about me. A lot of pizza places around! I won't bother again with this location smh"}
{"text":"Their chicken wings are great - the bone in kind, not the breaded ones. I get the thin crust 5 topping pizza. The food is tasty. I get the bacon and beef with pinapple and peppers. I also get dessert. I order it online & before I'm at the point of starvation because I know how long a pizza is going to take to cook and how long it takes to drive from this place to mine. People gotta get right with the world. There's microwave from the freezer done in 2-3 minutes, there's getting in the car driving to a place where you order that's going to take over an 75 minutes and then there's Dominos - between 30-35 min delivery and 15 minutes from online order to prep to bake to notification by text its ready to pick up. They have a cool 'status of order' tracker bar that lets you know where your order is at in the process. I can jump in the car during a commercial break or if not ordering a pizza take the bike during a 20 min hockey time out during winter if I'm watching a game. Go get it if you want it faster. Don't rate Domino's the restaurant on the basis of their drivers who are on the road with you."}
{"text":"This store loves to mess up orders apparently. The first time was a small accident , the kid was new so I gave them a second chance. But tonight was not that case. I called the store to advise my bread bowl pasta  was incorrect but the box label was correct. The ingredients they put in that we're wrong I was allergic to them and The assistant manager Tim said \"ok and...?\" Ok and... I want it fixed or my money back, neither of what Tim was willing to do. After admitting He made my food incorrectly he proceeded to not replace it he then said that he will only replace my food if I pay a delivery fee and waited an hour. No thanks! Why should I pay for your mistake you admitted too??? After tonight I won't be returning to this store again."}
{"text":"I went online and could not figure out how to order one cheese pizza and one pepperoni. User error maybe but, overall, quickness of site and delivery was just as good as ordering over the phone. Food however,  pizza good as usual, wings, not so good. I ordered mango habanero and expected better wings than local bars just because of the nationwide Dominoes name. ...not even close. My recommendation,  let them cook at least another 5-10 min or so for that nice crispyness. These were waaaay too soggy. Sauce wise, tasted like out of the marinade bottle from Lawry's Marinades.  There's my God honest truth of my review. Hopefully  it helps with new methods. Looking forward to trying the new method."}
{"text":"Called Domino's around 11:15pm on 6/16/2016 for delivery. I order from you guys about 4-5 times a month, and tip almost 50% to the driver everytime. (I'm a server so tips are my life)  Everytime (which is rare) a problem presented itself at this location, the managers and employees fixed it quickly and went above & beyond to make sure I am satisfied and the problem is fixed. Now, I NEVER look for anything free, I pay for what I want; but if the driver forgets my 2 liter, I'm still going to be thirsty and I'll still pay for it to be redelivered! But they usually take that off the price for customer satisfaction.  Anyways, called tonight and the person who answered the phone ROBERT, acted like I was a waste of time. Acted like this call was a bother to him, & didn't have any pleasant goodbye or farewell line. I was rushed off the phone & It was just  \"see you in an hour\" *click*  When I got done saying one thing I ordered the cut off/response was \"is that all\" \"is that all\" I kept saying \"no..I have some more.\" When it's usually \"what else can we get for you?!\" Guadalupe store, please bring back your other awesome employees!"}
{"text":"This review isn't necessarily for the food...we've always found it consistent, and we keep ordering it, so we obviously enjoy it.    This is mainly for the manager, Robin.  Last week, we had a problem with a delivery, and when I called to speak to someone about it, he took care of it immediately.  As well as taking care of me this week.  This is first-rate customer service.  We are good customers (especially during football season), and will continue to be.    Thank you, again!  By the way, everything was as delicious as it always is."}
{"text":"This place is terrible!! If I could give zero stars I would. Every time I order from this dominoes the order is wrong the driver gets lost. I've called the store several times to complain. The manager told me they gave me a credit was going to give them another try with my credit called them. They said the credit was not on their. horrible customer service horrible horrible horrible!!!"}
{"text":"Disgusting!! Ordered a pizza from here for delivery and it had a hair!! Called and spoke to Daniel the manager he seemed like it didn't matter (apparently these people do not wear hair nets) and was only going to replace one of the pizzas we order. Then when asked to credit our account and forget the whole thing he CHARGED us again!! Horrible horrible horrible!! Never again!!"}
{"text":"I have given this store so many chances, and they've ALWAYS let me down. They'll either overcook my food (burnt bread bites, YUCK!), completely make it wrong, or a combination of both. And then tonight, the delivery man wouldn't even come up to my door to DELIVER my food. I got a call from the store saying he was outside waiting for me. (WHAT?!) When I looked out my window, he was sitting in his car smoking. I had to walk down to the street to get my food.  NEVER again will I order from this place! They shouldn't even be allowed to have the Domino's name. It's a major shame on the company!"}
{"text":"Yeah so I called last night about 20 till close. They take my order and told me it will be 45-1hr for delivery... Hour and 15 mins later I call to confirm. No answer and THEY NEVER DELIVERED THE PIZZA!!! I checked my account and they didn't charge me luckily but who runs a business like this?? Just tell me you aren't going to deliver. Very very disappointed in this place. Screw them we just wanted pizza!! Will not use this place in the future and might not use a dominos again!!"}
{"text":"This location seriously sucks. I've ordered dozens of times, both for home and for work, and I finally give up.  Skimpiest toppings ever. You order extra cheese, doesn't matter- you'll still get regular cheese... and their version of regular cheese is pathetic. You order mushrooms- you'll get like 9 mushroom slices on the whole thing. Not to mention there is always a ring 3-4 inches around the whole pizza where there is practically no cheese or toppings at all (ring near the crust).  Other dominos locations are fine, this one is not. A shame too because this is close to my house, but I guess it's Papa Johns from now on."}
{"text":"This dominoes has really uped their game i order for my business and home and they always cater to my needs thank you!!!!"}
{"text":"I've ordered from this Domino's only a handful of times and everything is always fresh and the driver is always polite. Just recently I put in an order and the boyfriend bit into their Sweet BBQ Bacon Chicken and was put off. Some of the pieces were almost raw.. which was strange because the outside sauce was sort of burnt on the chicken.  I called the store and the employee was so polite and had no problem replacing the chicken, although we decided to just go with plain with dipping sauces instead. Because of our issues, they made the order bigger and sent the driver out right away. They definitely have my returning business!"}
{"text":"We've been ordering from this location for a year now and it's always been a great experience. The delivery drivers are always friendly and the wait is always faster than quoted. Whenever we have a problem they have no problem fixing it right away and going beyond than expected."}
{"text":"This place is pure garbage. Shit staff, shit pizza, takes 2 hours to deliver 5 minutes away.  Fuck Domino's."}
{"text":"The food is always good but I wait over an hour for my food to be delivered every time I order and I live less than 5 minutes away."}
{"text":"I am not a big fan of chain pizza restaurant, but I must say Dominos has step their game up . Being raised in Buffalo NY and having great family owned pizza restaurants changed my perception of pizza a long time ago. However also growing up in AL. I was used to chains too (tho I really only liked one the most). Dominos has step their game up and the taste is much better then it use to be. While at a friends house I had a slice and decided I would give them another try. When I do order it I must say I will order their thin crust cut in square's simply because that's how many northern places cut their larges unless you are ordering a slice. I enjoy their pizza a lot better knowing I can order it this way. The staff is friendly and if they make a mistakes they will fix it fast. It's pretty good for a chain."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery n it came so hot n fresh I ordered pizza n hot wings we r from Cali n never had a pizza  n wings that taste so good n fresh n the driver was so nice n polite on wed night around 1040  on southern st thanks u guys"}
{"text":"I've ordered from this from this store multiple times and every time I either don't get my food or it takes 2+ hours.  Every time I call the store and ask about it the employees are rude."}
{"text":"1st time trying Dominos and it was great. Service was excellent and painless. I love thin crust pizza and dominos hit the spot. I will back very soon to try the deep dish!"}
{"text":"I love their new pan pizza!! Its fast and cheap and the staff was very friendly and found me the best Deal!! Ill be back for sure."}
{"text":"Who the hell writes reviews for dominos. Lol. Look you could do this the easy way or you could do this the hard way.   The easy way is ordering dominos.   The hard way is ordering from literally any other pizza place."}
{"text":"I have always had a good experience with this Domino's location, food is always great and every time I have carried-out the service was pretty good, all my orders are placed online. I have no complaints at all!"}
{"text":"Poor customer service, rude and employee taking orders sounds like he'd rather be sleeping....my phone call was quit obvious an annoyance. With all that Dominoes is trying to do to improve their brand - it's a message that isn't being passed down to their individual stores."}
{"text":"Pizza arrived on time but delivery driver was extremely rude.... I thought that I payed a tip online... and when he arrived and handed me my pizza and receipt I signed it and put a line through the the tip on receipt ... as he walked away he stated, \" thanks a lot, we work for tips.\" I find this extremely unprofessional as I use to be a delivery driver at domino's and people wouldn't tip thinking they already included it. And I just accepted it. Rude delivery driver and a horrible show of customer service on domino's part... unacceptable..."}
{"text":"It is okay. Their sandwiches aren't very good. Seemed like there was no meat on the sandwich at all. Disappointed with how much they cost.   Pizza was good though. No pepperoncini? Should of went with papa johns. Maybe I'll try dominos again next year."}
{"text":"This is a new Dominos location that just opened a few months ago replacing some other pizza store in its place. I wasn't a big fan of Dominos to begin with but I did come to realize they do definitely have some good deals and they told me they have better promotions if you order online. I find myself ordering my lunch here at least once a week! The staff is friendly and quick the girl who is store manager is very nice and very talkative with her customers and it's good to see that in a fast food restaurant. It's a great addition to this north area of Oakville as I work and live in the area and my family loves this pizza and cinna stix!"}
{"text":"Terrible terrible service. They get a basic order completely wrong and then argue with you when you call to correct it.   At this business,  the customer is not right...."}
{"text":"Worst pizza ever!  Pizza was delivered. Opened the box and half the cheese and toppings are off the pizza and in the box!  Called the store and employee tells me \"sorry. We can have another one there in 30 minutes!\"  Told him that was going to be too late and I wouldn't be ordering anything else. Then we \"tried\" to eat the mess.  It was NOT baked and still doughy!  Then the \"manager\" called to basically say the same thing!  Gave me 1-800-dominos if I wanted to talk to someone else!  NEVER AGAIN"}
{"text":"Probably the most consistently bad Dominos location in Arizona. Toppings are thrown on the pizza, one slice will have 6 pieces of pepperoni and lots of cheese. The slice next to it will have almost no cheese and 1 piece of pepperoni. The worst part is they don't care how the pizza looks when they put it in the box. They also must blindfold the person that cuts the pizza, because it never is cut into 8 almost equal slices. Go to Pizza Hut, they seem to care about quality."}
{"text":"It's a lazy Sunday, I'm feeling fuzzy, the Domino's commercial comes on, I think \"Mmmmm, some chocolate lava cake would be delicious right about now...\"  I pick up my tablet, order some Parmesan cheesy bread bites and chocolate lava cake.  My tablet shows in real time where my order is in the process.  When it shows that my order is out for delivery, I gather my cash and fill my tea glass.  Sure enough, a few moments later the delivery guy arrives.  He's not even scary- he's clean and his uniform fits right, his pants aren't hanging off his butt and he's not stoned...  it was a stellar experience!  My lava cake was delicious just like I knew it would be...  Thanks Domino's!  Well done from marketing to delivery  :-)"}
{"text":"Hey domino's. Just ordered the pizza from your place.  Your delivery boy is  smokin hot. Didn't catch his name but he was young and had gauges in his ears.  Very professional gave him a 7 dollar tip. He deserves it. :D very good. Give him a raise!"}
{"text":"Another disappointing experience with their pizzas. I just hoped they changed- learned how to make a good pizza. But no - again VERY DRY, so LITTLE toppings!!!! Just sad!!!!!!"}
{"text":"This dominoes is awesome great customer service and friendly staff. My wife and I called at 9:45 to see when they closed for carry out they said ten then asked if we were close. I said yes they said chine on if it's after ten they would still let us come in."}
{"text":"I placed my order over 2 hours ago. After checking if the driver had left with the order yet, they finally did BUT they've been taken almost an hour to deliver when I live only 10-15 minutes away from the store. Terrible service. We'll see how long it takes for my \"hot\" order to get here."}
{"text":"I always order online at www.dominos.com.  Ordering is super easy, but the delivery is always fast, my pizza is always hot and delicious - just the way I want it.  The drivers are always prompt, polite and professional.  It makes ordering some dinner on a busy night after work a no-brainer."}
{"text":"Be careful!  The online order would not let me put my apt. # in.  And I am a repeat customer you had all of my info.  The pizza left Dominos 40 minutes.  I called the manager.  She said there were problems with the online ordering.  This was 20 minutes ago. Don't order from here!"}
{"text":"Quick and easy take out. Pizza was topped well with sausage, pepperoni and mushroom.  It's dominos."}
{"text":"Always love this Dominoe's!!! They deliver super fast and are always super nice! Their new pan pizza is fastly becoming our favorite. Their stuffed cheesy breads are sooo delicious and their chicken bites are yummy too!!  They have defenitly come a long! Keep up the delicious work Big D!!!"}
{"text":"Great pizza if you're into the Brooklyn style pizza and make sure you get it extra crispy.  It's like the 10th time I've ordered here and had one error but they fixed it with a complementary pizza.  I ordered pizza last week at Papa Johns on south blvd and my pizza was under cook and I called and complained nothing was done about it so I guess you guys will be our go to pizza place now. Thank you guys for the awesome service and keep up the good work."}
{"text":"This location opened up about a month ago.  We ordered pickup twice from here already! Pizza is pretty good.  Friendly staff on the phone.  Parking is ok here, it can get busy.  So far so good.  They have a grand opening special right now-  4 topping Large for $10 !! Not sure how long that is on for so Hurry !!"}
{"text":"Gotta say i am impressed with their online website. It's easy to navigate, order what you want, then walk over and pick it up.  The best is, it was ready.   Used to be one of my favorite pizza places back in the day but it somehow lost it's way. Personally I'd rather travel a bit and get a great pizza but when it comes to convenience this one is across the street.   Over all i was happy with the pie i ordered and will continue to order from here on those nights when it's late and i don't feel like cooking."}
{"text":"This Domino's is NOT the place to go. I got a pizza with cardboard crust, very little (almost no) cheese, and a very small amount of the one ingredient I asked for. The driver was nice as well as the person on the phone, but the pizza was worthless and tasteless -- since it had tiny amounts of cheese and one ingredient. Don't order on the phone. Heck, I'd say just don't bother with this place at all."}
{"text":"I've been to this location a few times, and I've been pleased with the service, and the food. Tonight was a very different story. I walked in the door at 10:30 on the dot, to just pick up a chicken Caesar salad. I was told by the gentleman at the counter that they didn't do carry out past 1030... Let me remind you it was 1030 exactly when I walked in... i'm literally in shock right now it's not as if I went in at 11, and asked... they stop serving at 10:30. Customer service is everything, and I was really disappointed tonight."}
{"text":"Not sure who answered the phone but she should go through ten minutes of customer service training before speaking to your customers. She typed in the numbers from my card wrong and then talked to me like I was an idiot that was inconveniencing her by trying to order pizza from the phone operator at dominos pizza... are you serious? Then hung up on me when I asked to talked to a manager. Good job lady, keep living the dream. You sounded 40, at least. I'm sure one day you're life will be worth more than minimum wage."}
{"text":"I ordered a simple online order tonight at 5:58pm. Typical online responses through the online system. I watched the online tracker intermittently.   6:49 driver departs for delivery. 7:30 I'm getting a knock. No big deal. Until he hands me a pizza box that is cool to the touch and an almost soggy box bottom.  I was beyond annoyed. Remember avoid the Noid!  Nope, it wasn't avoided. The worse part of all, calling the manager. Getting the nonchalant response sent me over the top.  I felt like he couldn't have cared less. His offer was to send out another pizza. Thanks but no thanks. I don't have to time. This was this stores second shot at success. You failed Dominos."}
{"text":"I ordered dominoes tonight and regretted it. Website was easy to use. Delivery was fast, too fast because pizza was soggy and under cooked. Driver was very polite.   I did leave feedback on their website and much to the credit to the manager, Miranda, she called me right away and offered a credit for next time. Doesn't help for tonight. Suggestion please not so much sauce and cook the pizza!!"}
{"text":"We ordered 14 pizzas for an event at 2pm and were told they would be done by 7pm...after we got here, we were greeted with a half-hearted welcome from a guy who didn't even turn to look at us. After telling him our name the other lady said it would be another 15 minutes...very upset with this service"}
{"text":"Dont waste your time I cant believe they stay in business they suck if you want to wait an hour or two then order dont give them business they dont know anything about  customer survive only a star because it wont let me put anything lower."}
{"text":"Fabulous service.grt Wn iam in pittsburgh wid my family i keep on ordering to south side dominos."}
{"text":"These clowns sent me burnt brownies. I wish when I ordered online that it would have stated \"our employees are clowns\" and \"we hope you enjoy burnt brownies.\""}
{"text":"first time here ordered it online 6 hours prior to going to pick it up and it was hot,and ready when i went to go get it no complaints here will return for more later on."}
{"text":"My go-to for Domino's. Despite being a chain, Domino's will almost always get a 4-star review from me. This is the location that delivers to me. Located conveniently inside the Quail Corners shopping center for quick in and out pick up too.  Domino's has really come a long way from being the cut-rate pizza of my childhood. Even up through college you'd never dream of picking them before Papa John's or even Pizza Hut. Now those two are next in line. I love the ham and pineapple hand tossed and the specialty chicken with bacon and tomato. This alone was a genius invention. The forever coupon that allows you to pick several different items for $5.99 each is perfect. And the best way to round out an already filling meal from here is with the chocolate lava cakes for $4. When you just feel a lazy night coming on this is the way to go. Or if, like me, you've just rode nearly 40 miles on your bike burning 2,000 calories in about 2 hours this is a great way to put it all back."}
{"text":"It is inexcusable that a pizza order takes 90 minutes to be delivered after three phone calls to find out where it is. Mario, the manager said he answered all three calls. He claims that calls were made to the person who placed the order for delivery but there was no missed calls. Mario, the manager,  says that the delivery driver says he got to the The NEVADA Climbing Center and no one was there by that name. Mario, the manager insisted that the driver was in the right place. Mario, the manager, did not tell me that he was rude to the person who ordered the pizza during each call. If an order is placed for pizza delivery and it takes 90 minutes to arrive, I don't care what the reason is! That order should be comped! Or at the very least discounted! These 3 pizzas were ordered for a youth group that was together for a 2 hour event. It is understandable that the NEVADA Climbing Center is located in a area that is difficult to find. However, ordering from this particular dominos pizza store was a big mistake. And Mario, the manager, needs to learn how to say five words, \"I am sorry this happened.\" With so many options to order pizza delivery look elsewhere."}
{"text":"delivery has taken a half an hou already! not sure where Badie is but ite taking too damn long!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Seriously ...I get the product isn't going to look like the pictures on the net but it's not even close to resembling it. It tasted like an undercooked cookie. Very disappointed. Don't waste your money !!!"}
{"text":"I have never been disappointed here.  We usually get the large 3 item pizza for 7.99.  Order online and you can follow the cooking process.  What we like is you can get 3 items on one half, and different choices on the other half.  Get extra cheese you will be glad you did....far better then little Caesars, Pizza Hut etc etc etc"}
{"text":"Absolutely the worst Dominoes I have ever dealt with. Normally Dominoes has pretty good service but I would never consider ordering from this store again.  I ordered salad and bone less wings around 11:40pm on a Thursday night and the estimate was 45 minutes. An hour and a half later my delivery guy finally shows up. Barely even says hi and hands me a receipt and asks me to sign it. He then proceeds to hand me the salad and box of wings. The box of wings of course is not even hot to the touch, that would be way too much to ask.  I ask him for the silverware for my salad and he says \"oh yeah, I forgot that. I have to go back for your dressing because I forgot that too.\" At this point I didn't even realize what he was saying...I thought he meant he had went back already and that's why it took so long. I then get back into my hotel room and open the boxes up and realize I have dry cold wings without the sauce I ordered, and a salad with no silverware or dressing. Are you kidding me?  At this point it is after 1am and this guy thinks he's going to go back to the store for dressing and come back? So now I get to sit here while my wings get even colder and wait for sauces?  The worst part is that the delivery guy seems to think it was funny. He wasn't rude or anything like that, but he was like \"oh haha I'm all over the place tonight, I have to go back for half your food haha.\" But really, it's not even a tiny bit funny.  I called the store and told the manager I wanted a full refund immediately. He didn't even ask any questions and just refunded my meal. You would think they'd at least want to know why their customers are unhappy, but seems like a regular thing there. Good thing they refunded my money but that doesn't change the fact that I stayed awake an hour and a half waiting for dinner and then finally got this gross cold product I couldn't even eat. And no I have no other options for food tonight so thanks Dominoes for ruining my dinner and my night."}
{"text":"Ya know what?? DON'T HATE.   This isn't Domino's from 10 years ago. They've made a MAJOR effort to step their game up, and I applaud that. This isn't five-star pizza- indeed, there are MUCH better options in the area, but you know what?? Sometimes, it's 10pm, and you just want a pizza that you KNOW you're going to enjoy, even if it isn't your favourite. And that's where the big D comes in. I've never gotten anything from here that I hated, and it's nice to know that EVERY Domino's in the entire freakin' NATION will make their pizzas the EXACT same way. It's comforting. It's later-evening food. It's reliable, and they've never let me down.   Sometimes, you have to just eat a damned Domino's pizza. If you're a self-proclaimed \"foodie\" who gags at the mere thought of a chain restaurant, feel free to go fuck yourself, because some days you just need to slum it.  Peace."}
{"text":"Right down the street from my house so I always go and pick up my pizza. Pizza is always ready when they say it will be,  piping hot. Cashiers are always upbeat and friendly.  Right now Mon-Thursday you can get a large 3 topping for $7.99. I used to hate Domino's but since they have changed their recipes I have become a fan. Their pan pizza is my go to for pizza style. They also do a decent Brooklyn style pizza, but being from NY/NJ there's no comparison to the real thing!"}
{"text":"I've ordered from this location a couple times. Good location and easy to get in and out.  The website makes it easy to order what you want and how you want it.  The pizza is always cooked well and tastes good. As good as it could be with pizza chain pizza.  I recently ordered the bbq chicken wings. They just seemed really fatty and pretty much tasteless. I'm sure it's not this stores fault - as I assume they are just a general wing sent to each location for prep.   I think I'll just stick to ordering pizza."}
{"text":"This was THE WORST experience i have had with ANY online ordering! I ordered two large pizzas, and one medium pizza, and garlic knots ONLINE yesterday, 5/9/18. This order was placed at 4:24 p.m. for PICKUP by 6:15 p.m. I had somewhere to be at 6:30 p.m. Lo and behold, the order was NOT READY! Their lame excuse: They never received it in their queue! I got my order 45 minutes later and was 30 minutes late to my activity. I will never order any more pizza from Domino's! All they could offer me was their apologies and a free bottle of soda. NEVER, EVER AGAIN."}
{"text":"Just ordered the special!  2 large pizzas one topping with howie bread for 20 bucks! I added one topping extra for 99 cents more to make a ham and pineapple!  I love how you can get different flavored crusts! The ranch crust is delicious!! But the garlic is my favorite! It's delicious and does have a real garlic flavor not mild, real garlic taste!!! Can't beat the price and quality of Hungry Howies! I'll be back again!"}
{"text":"I love that even though this location is in Las Vegas and I'm in Henderson I've never had any problems when it comes to ordering from them. They always arrive on time and the driver is always polite. My food is always super hot as if it just came out of the oven. They've also never forgotten an item like others have stated has happened to them. I've also never experienced anyone being rude to me on the phone when I have called to ask a question about my order. These are the reasons why I will continue to order from them and I order a lot of pizza LOL."}
{"text":"Sometimes you want pizza and nothing else will do. You don't want to pay for Metro, you're boycotting Papa Johns, Pizza Hut messed up your last order again, someone in the house is craving pasta or sandwiches, and DiGiorno pizza from Smiths won't do. Domino's filled the need when nothing else sounded good. This store was clean, the service was friendly, my order was right, and the pizza and sandwiches didn't suck. What more can you ask for?"}
{"text":"Food isn't bad, but the delivery service left much to be desired today. I placed an order at 3:50 PM and it didn't get here until around 5:15 PM. I was beginning to wonder if they had to go to Alaska to make my order...geez! When my food did arrive, it was lukewarm and I had to reheat it. Whatever happened to delivery in 30 minutes or less?"}
{"text":"Went online and placed an order. It has been forever since we have gotten dominoes pizza. I love how you can check the tracker but I don't think it's very accurate. It said on the tracker that it took 20 mins for them to make our pizza, this was before they put it in the oven even though we were quoted only 20-23 minutes for our pizzas to be ready. My husband decided to go anyways and by the time he was there, it said on the tracker that the pizzas just got in the oven but his pizzas were actually ready. Overall, the pizzas are good. I asked for extra sauce on my pan pizza and it was very dry around the crust. Toppings are good but the portion control wasn't spread out as evenly as I liked."}
{"text":"I love this Dominos...whatever we order is always yummy and they are always on time..the Chicken BBQ thin crust is the best anywhere!  My husband can only eat gluten free pizza and he says Domino's does the gluten free the best.  It's nice to have a good, quick pizza deivery right around the corner that is consistent and makes the whole family happy."}
{"text":"Pizza and wings were great. Would order from them again. Pizza was hot and toppings were plentiful. The online ordering was kind of slow. What's wrong with customer service, personal touch."}
{"text":"Do not order delivery from here. Late flight in and ordered to hotel at 9pm.was told 45 minutes but the place not more than half mile away. Food arrived at 11pm. Big mistake as I dumped dominos in the past and should have maintained that attitude instead of giving them another chance. Driver was reluctantly apologetic. Do yourself a favor and order somewhere else for pizza and sandwiches."}
{"text":"At first I was getting upset because my delivery was taking longer than normal. Then I get the notification that my delivery was on the way & I met this young lady named Jocelyn. Let me tell you, jocelyn was such a kind hearted person that her attitude and presentation made me forget about the wait time. She delivered my food with a pleasant attitude and said sorry for the wait time. She exceeded my expectations."}
{"text":"2/14/2014 We oreder 2 large pizza from this Dominos pizza location, after 1 hour and 10 minutes we got the pizza, but it was very cold and one of was burned, we called the store and made a complain, but they told me they were short of drivers and that was the reason, she said call other manager somewhere  else, I told her why I should call, she unwillingly took my number, but never received the call,now $35 may not be a big deal, but if they keep doing it and get away with it, and people don't bother to make a complaine, this people will keep doing this with no consequences, I paid $35 for 2 cold and burned pizza"}
{"text":"Yeah, I'm never ordering delivery from this Domino's again. In like a six week span, I ordered from this location twice for delivery. The first time it arrived cold, as not only was I the driver's last stop on like a five-stop run, but it was like he left the damn pizza bag open, driving with his window down. I make a comment about this on their website. A week later they send me a coupon that can't be used for online orders as an apology. Whatever. Next time I order, I order online like I always do because damn their coupon, I like the convenience. Anyways, this time around the order actually arrived piping hot. Nice. Then I open up my stuffed cheesy bread which is supposed to be the jalapeno kind. Yeah, it wasn't. It was just regular ol' plain stuffed cheesy bread. I didn't bother to complain because it ain't like that's going to make a bunch of slacker employees and managers do better at their jobs. Plus, doing so would've probably just resulted in them mailing me another coupon. And I really don't want to be collecting coupons to a crappy pizza joint."}
{"text":"This place always has our back..simple as that. Easy & quick, we order from this location a lot.  -1 star because tonight they were out of paper plates (we took our pizza to the park & needed some); weird that they were out but whatevs.   The pizza is somewhat basic of course but tasty & I love the thin crust option (less carbs).  Domino's has really improved over the past few years & our tummies never hurt after eating it which is a win in my book."}
{"text":"i will never order from here again spent $50 for nothing the pizza was dry it needed more sauce my kids even refused to eta it we ended up throwing everyhing away and went some where else i will not be back"}
{"text":"We have ordered from here three times and they always get our order wrong. I've never experienced any pizza place who delivers the wrong pizza. We called the third time because they gave us the wrong pizza and they asked if they could give me a credit and I said no I want what I ordered and gave me a huge attitude about it when they delivered it. No sorry no apology just a whatever here's your food. Won't be ordering from here again. Sucks I've never had an issue with any other dominoes except this one. Obviously by the other reviews things need to be fixed."}
{"text":"Wrong order and terrible food. At least the good news is nobody should eat this crap anyway. We definitely learned our lesson and won't."}
{"text":"Their food is way better than it was when I tried it a few years ago. Their service is maybe one of the worst I've had from a pizza joint.  The first time we tried it,  they forgot the extra sauces we paid for.  Second time they forgot our garlic bites..the driver went back and got them, but when we opened our pizza they forgot our pineapple topping..have a habit of charging and not giving.  So from now on if I want pizza from here I will go in so that I get everything I paid for."}
{"text":"This place is disgusting. Not only are the windows completely finger marked up, the floor is molded in corners and the staff looks to match. I wouldn't order food from this place if it wasn't 1am and limited options.  The food was over cooked, dry and bland. My chicken bacon ranch sandwich looked like kids play and I actually fed it to my dog.   The manager on staff at the time --Chris-- had no idea they food was coming out this way and had no real managing/people skills that I could see from our 5 minute conversation.  Yuck and yuck."}
{"text":"It's close to where I live and open late which is great! Pizza quality is as it should be for dominoes. No complaints :)"}
{"text":"This review is in regards to the person who posted about the driver expecting a tip, I used to deliver pizzas and that's how we make our money. If you do not want to tip the delivery driver and you should get up and pick up your own pizza is not only convenience but a service services need to be tipped. The pizza is always good there, their customer service is great, and the drivers are wonderful. So for all you wonderful people ordering Domino's Pizza please take into consideration that these drivers  are using their own vehicles (gas, where and tear, and time). As I said before if you don't want to tip for somebody's time then pick up your own pizza.  Thank you dominoes for making me always a happy customer.      Oh my goodness what happened? Are used to love to eat here yesterday was a horrible experience. Ordered two large pizzas one pizza had just cheese thin crust, the other was a hand tossed sausage Canadian bacon pepperoni and green pepper pizza. The sausage was barely there. How disappointing. When I went to pick up my pizzas the guy at the counter to my pizzas and I thought they were going to get messed up but they did not I check them and as I was looking at the second pizza hand tossed I noticed that there was almost no sausage I will post a picture when I asked The young lady about it she goes well I didn't make it OK I understand that but is this how you guys make pizzas she said you want me to make it again and I said well no because my other pizza will get cold, not once did she say will make them both over. She could tell I was not happy so she said what do you want me to give you your money back. I was so angry at that point I said no I will take care of it another way. What a sad disappointing pizza night. I will choose somewhere else to go where they make pizzas correctly."}
{"text":"Too many negative experiences to outweigh the satisfactory ones. No delivery after waiting over two hours (on two separate occasions), went to wrong address a few weeks ago so the food was cold, doughy under cooked pan pizza yet another time. Fortunately there are many other pizza companies in Bethel Park to choose from. Domino's app. deleted from my phone."}
{"text":"I've already given these guys three chances...once I had delivery (the first time) and surprisingly for a new store they actually did the best on my first attempt. The second time I ordered online for delivery, ended up waiting for over an hour and fifteen minutes (advertised time according to the website was 24 - 36 minutes, mind you) then called in, was put on hold by two different people for another 20 minutes, and finally got in my car and drove to Jimmy John's instead after giving up. The third time I called in and decided to try my luck with carry-out, but it was clear upon arrival that most of the staff had no idea what was going on and zero concept of customer service. Extremely disorganized and uncoordinated, only 1 of the 6 or 7 employees I saw there really seemed to have a clue...it would be a single star if it weren't for him trying to keep it all together."}
{"text":"Been using their computer ordering system with tremendous success...Today I screwed up the order and a real live person from the store called to confirm what I really wanted...Kudos Domino's for getting it really right!"}
{"text":"Dominos has a super easy website to order delivery and they usually have some pretty great deals and coupons ready for use as well. I especially enjoy the delivery tracker that tells you when your pizza is made and when it is on its way. I have found them to be a little slow from when they leave the store to when they deliver but the pizza does come hot. I prefer dominos to papa johns and equate it to Pizza Hut. Try the plain cheese pizza. The garlic bites are pretty good too. I'm not in love with the pre packaged marinara sauce and wish the cups were bigger since you have to pay for extra ones. Overall, this location is convenient for me since it delivers and I've never had any problems."}
{"text":"Dominos has a great easy online ordering system. Props to dominos for the online tracker that shows when your pizza is made and on its way. This location delivers quickly and the pizza is hot, fresh, cheesy goodness. They always have coupons and deals on their site. I will definitely order from here again!"}
{"text":"Taste good but had to cut up the sausage. Clearly there were some short cuts taken and they jus threw these chunks on the pizza"}
{"text":"Have ordered take out a few times at this location since it's close to work.  The person taking the orders have always been nice.  The specials they have on certain days-fridays- are great!  I got 2 medium special pizzas for under $20, really good crust.  Pacific Veggie, 7 Cheese, and Surpreme are just yummy!  Something about the crust that makes me keep going back!"}
{"text":"I was in the mood for some really good pizza and wings to eat during the Steeler game. I was super disappointed with these wings and pizza. The wings were super rubbery. After touching them and feeling how jello-y they felt I couldn't bring myself to eat one. Yuck!  The pizza had very little cheese on it. I'm glad we got toppings. They helped bring a little flavor. Such a bummer to get food so disappointing."}
{"text":"Service is terrible. I ordered on the app but then called to confirm my sauces. Ordered 1 steak hoagie & 1 Italian hoagie. When I called to make sure they would send mayo & Italian dressing with the sandwiches I was put on hold, transferred, and called back just for them to tell me they would charge for Italian dressing because it didn't come on the hoagie & the didn't have mayo. So much for that order. Cancelled. Don't order here. Shane because there's not much to eat in this area."}
{"text":"Holy Cow!! So there are 3 ppl running this place on a Tuesday night at 10. One other customer is standing there and she is being a pain, BUT you do not speak to a customer that way nor do you talk about them after they leave to store while another another costumer is standing there. It's just rude. I'm pretty sure her name was Amanda, she is a very rude person. Rolling her eyes, telling the other lady they are a restaurant not a taste testing. All the lady wanted to do was try a sauce. Not rocket science; squirt that shit in a little cup or on a napkin like the lady asked. Never again will I go back....bad customer service."}
{"text":"I ordered 2 pizzas and some dessert online today and it gave me a 50% off deal which was truly amazing. The delivery was very fast, food was warm, and it was delicious. What more could you ask for?"}
{"text":"Love this dominos ! Makes much better pizza then the other dominos I've tried . Quick and hot delivery . Nice staff . Good value for the money"}
{"text":"This is the nicest Dominos I've ever been to! Ordered on the app and everything was ready in less than ten minutes. It's always nice to see when employees don't hate their jobs"}
{"text":"Can I choose zero stars?  I'm sitting waiting for my food and all I hear is cussing and employees talking bad about customers.   Good thing for dominos they don't rely on customer service and feedback because they are a crappy Walmart style pizza dump.   If only I had something cheap like dominos closer."}
{"text":"The Guy or girl name Jamie that deliver my pizza was very rude. BAD customer service. I don't like the how I was treated. They need to hire drivers that will have good customer services. Bad people!!!"}
{"text":"This location is who we use for our delivery pizza . They are consistently fresh, quick and delicious . The delete people are always in a good mood and clean. The store is very accommodating for parties as well. We'll continue ordering from them long term!"}
{"text":"We ordered at counter and took to go because no seating at this location except for waiting.  I think the pizza was a 4 Star and service about a 3.  Nice people but kind of disorganized.  There was a screen where you saw status of your order.  The guy changed my name. And did not tell me which confused me.  Other than that confusing part it was decent. Good pizza."}
{"text":"Take out; Thurston is high on the job. Consistently makes wrong pizzas, can't understand simple instructions, and isn't sanitary.   Other employees tried to pass off an incorrect pizza as no prob.   A disaster."}
{"text":"Worst dominos I've ever visited. Waited 3 hours the first time for my pizza to be delivered, so I called and asked them to cancel the order. Next time, I waited 2 hours and sat on the phone for 20 minutes waiting for them to answer and cancel the order.  Absolutely ridiculous. Such poor customer service. The girl I spoke to had a big attitude too. Last time ordering dominos in Tempe!"}
{"text":"Omg I eat here like once a month and I just had to write a yelp review to tell ya about my experience. I ordered a pizza, they said come pick it up in 10 minutes, so I got there in 10 minutes and whattya know my dang pizza was done!  YOULL NEVER GUESS WHAT HAPPENED NEXT. I pulled out my iPhone X  (space gray) and used Apple Pay (dominoes has Apple Pay) and then they gave me my pizza and I went home. BUT THATS NOT THE END OF THE STORY. So I'm at home, right?  I open up the box to find EXACTLY WHAT I ORDERED. And what really blew my mind.... it was totally hot and when I tasted it... WOW. It tasted just like every other Doninos pizza I've ever had. Unbelievable."}
{"text":"Consistently well-made food, delivered lightning-quick! The items are very consistently cooked over many delivery orders, which to me is a sign of a good, all-around location with consistent practices.   Their pan pizza crust is DELICIOUS, and as an added bonus we've even ordered the gluten-free crust for our guests who remarked it was the best GF crust they could find around - which is saying a lot, as apparently most GF crusts taste like cardboard. :)  -1 star for not having any leafy pizza topping options (no spinach, arugula for example), and because they've recently had an annoying tendency to forget dip cups with orders, necessitating phone calls and credits.   Order online or with their app to get credits toward free pizza, too!"}
{"text":"Just order a pizza from this location at 10:38pm,  The service and quality of the pizza was perfect. The driver Jesse was very friendly and nice, he got the pizza here with awesome timing less then 20mins I will be purchasing here again."}
{"text":"favorite pizza place!! order many pizzas so we get rewards and it is worth it. the garlic parmeasean sauce is really delicious."}
{"text":"Corporate needs to review this location.  They don't answer the phone and the pizza was undercooked, yup the old days of dominoes pizza folding like wet paper are back here.  Forgot part of our order and they won't answer to get it corrected.  Update:  went into the location and it was packed.  Showed the manager the pizza and got a refund for the pizza and sauces that weren't delivered"}
{"text":"As far as Domino's goes, this one is pretty consistent with others that I've visited. I usually only go if I'm able to use a coupon but if you order online, those are usually readily available. If you ask me, Domino's pizza tends to be a bit on the saltier side but that just means that it goes well with beer!"}
{"text":"Needless to say I never even got my pizza so yea I'm still waiting and it's been almost and hour since they left the store. Very disappointed"}
{"text":"This is the Domino's that delivers to my area, and I have never had any issues with this establishment before. Their delivery is very quick, no matter the day of the week. Delivery drivers are also nice, and I have received a complete and correct order every time. I will continue to order from this store !"}
{"text":"Love this store. I usually order from online and it is ready for pick up about 15 minutes later..Always good customer service also.."}
{"text":"We recently ordered from this Domino's for the first time. Definitely a good call! I was getting aggravated with other places in the area and Domino's was a perfect solution. Their hand-tossed pizza is delicious, my husband and daughter ate it up. The Parmesan bites are super yummy, and everything arrived quickly. The delivery driver was also super friendly, which is a relief.   We will be back! For big chain store pizza, Domino's is the best. The app, the delivery status, the price, the food, the people- it seems like they've got all their ducks in a row!"}
{"text":"Good pizza. Delivery took half an hour longer than expected. I would not order delivery from here again."}
{"text":"Pretty gross. Although they provide great customer service, a manager was in tonight and had the employees cleaning the vents over the food (yuck!) and mopping the counter top with a floor mop. It was very disgusting. We don't even want to eat out pizza."}
{"text":"I loved the little pizza Pete display of making my pizza after I ordered online. They delivery was very fast and the pizza it super hot. The pasta is done to perfection with a great flavor. My son ordered the lava cakes and says they are delicious. The delivery guy was super nice! I will definitely order from this location again. I can't wait to try the sandwiches. Who knew they had sandwiches?"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying I love pizza. I eat it about 1-2x a week. I'll eat at the local shops and the large chains and places like Costco. I hate Little Caesar's pizza and now i hate Domino's too. I decided to give them another try on account of my mother in law giving me a $10 gift card. I tried their 3 topping carryout special and got 2 pizzas. Now I got a bunch of pizza that the trash can will eat.   The crust was gross and was over seasoned. It's kind they are hiding the lack of quality of crust with an overabundance of seasoning. The same ad a stinky teenage kid does with to much cologne / body spray.   It'll probably another 5+ years until I decide to torture my taste buds again. This was a bad choice. Do yourself and the local economy a favor and buy from one the bazzillion local pizza places, all of which will take a hundred times better than the crap I'm attempting to digest right now!"}
{"text":"That was the most horrible experience I've ever had. I live literally .2 miles away, and it took 55 minutes to get my pizza. They said they pulled it out of the oven at 7:12, and I did not receive it until 745, which meant my pizza was more than a half an hour old by the time I received it. I tried calling the manager several times and only got put on hold. I do not recommend this Domino's!"}
{"text":"Horrible service. They messed up my bread bowl, called back and asked me if I wanted a $5 when clearly, the bread-bowl is $10. This is an utter insult!!!! I'm also filing a complaint with the Better Business Bureau about this type of service."}
{"text":"This Domino's Pizza is fast and accurate.  I wish I could give 4.5 stars just for the ease of ordering on my phone through their web page.  I found what I needed, including coupons and deals, placed my order, and it came fast!  We were drinking on a Friday night with a neighbor and I was hungry.  I ordered it on my phone and surprised the gang.  #Winning!  I really recommend the Brooklyn style pizza, it's a thinner crust than traditional but not so thin it is crispy.  I get it with more than just mozzarella....try the other cheeses.  The pizza is just wonderful with a side of garlic sauce.  Love this place!"}
{"text":"Topping portion makes no sense. I did pay for triple so why did you simple measure a single amount and triple? Dominos, your online is horrible.  Oh yeah, didn't bring the drinks either. Ugh"}
{"text":"Ordered a thin crust BBQ chicken pizza that had almost no sauce.  Hardest and driest pizza I have ever eaten.  Very disappointed!"}
{"text":"This rating is for the experience I had yesterday. I have always had fairly good service from this location in the past but yesterday was shameful. I called for a delivery. The fellow who answered the phone took my order and credit card information. After TWO HOURS of waiting, I called Domino's to see where my pizza was. No one seemed to know! I asked to speak to the manager (who also informed me that she was \"general manager\"). This \"general manager\" couldn't stop talking long enough to listen! It was pretty simple if you ask me - I ordered a pizza, I paid for a pizza and TWO hours later - I have no pizza.  Disappointing enough to go elsewhere."}
{"text":"This location is fast and nearby.  I usually order pizza and wings and its always good.  I always order with my phone app and it is easy to use and never had any problems.  When the app says it's ready I go to the store and it is waiting for me.  Staff is friendly and quick. I know that there is better pizza out there but sometimes I don't want to wait long or I just want to stay at home.  Domino's is good for those days."}
{"text":"After a day in sessions at a conference I decided to order pizza to the hotel as I was quite hungry and just felt like a simple pizza. Domino's hit the spot. They had a great deal that gave me enough pizza for dinner and a late night snack.   There was nothing special nor wrong with the pizza. Just the same familiar taste that I've grown up eating."}
{"text":"Worst service ever! I ordered online and when they arrived wanted me to pay more then my amount due. And expected me to pay with cash when I had inputted my credit card information already.. don't waste your time ordering from them"}
{"text":"Constantly wrong orders and missing sides and sauces. We're DONE! We've had it with this location. No more. This location should not have the dominoes name. Shameful. Turning off lots of customers. Not a believer? Read the rest of the most recent reviews......"}
{"text":"The food was great, but I almost had a conniption when the lady cashing us out saw us walk in, then proceeded to blow her nose into a tissue, and touch all of our food and cash us out (touching my debit card) with her snot rag IN HER HAND THE ENTIRE TIME. I work in a restaurant and I know for a fact I would be fired for an offense like that. Really just grossed me out and changed the vibe of the entire restaurant. I take hygiene very seriously, especially when it comes to food. Don't let this happen again, because ew."}
{"text":"As expected. Pretty good pizza, pretty quick service. Takes on average 30 minutes to arrive, follows directions well and even have called to confirm instructions, but still delivered on time. Significantly better than the local pizza pizza."}
{"text":"Bring back 5$ large pizzas for Monday madness!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Monday madness was the best thing about Fall '17 but I still come back this semester because they're such a close and consistent carry-out option"}
{"text":"The new management is awesome! Ask for Randy if you have *any* problems, he always gives you what you want & more! Seriously. Kind of hidden away but they always give you discounts on whatever you order here. YOU GUYS ROCK!"}
{"text":"I placed an online order for a personal pizza at 12:49pm and it wasn't ready for delivery until 1:55pm!!! When the pizza did arrive a little after 2pm..... It was ice cold! Nothing like having to reheat a pizza that supposedly was just baked!! I would definitely not recommend unless you are planning to not eat any of it until later or the next day since you are going to have to reheat it anyways!"}
{"text":"Normally extremely fast delivery to any side street off broadview (~15-20 minutes). I've had two instances where it took upwards of 50 minutes, the most recent of which I got an apology and a coupon for my next order, which was much appreciated"}
{"text":"Tried this location for the first time..ordered a small pizza. Everything was perfect. Customer service was friendly and they got my order right. A+"}
{"text":"The best location! My pizza is always made perfectly and never overcooked. The employees have always been very courteous and quick."}
{"text":"Enjoying the end of a week by NOT cooking. We decided on pizza.  Staff was friendly. Store was clean. Pizza was hot and delicious. Summerlin Dominos is a safe bet when ordering  pizza and I would definitely recommend.  Only 4 stars because this location can skimp on the cheese and that's just not cool."}
{"text":"This one rounds out my selection of pizza shops in Laveen.  They all get one star, although I think I will now go back and modify my rating of Duner's, which is the only locally owned place for za nearby, to reflect that it's at least better than Domino's, Pizza Hut, and Little Ceasar's.  The only redeeming quality about Domino's is the ease of ordering and delivery.  Thank goodness I won't have to change out of my snuggy to get pizza at home!"}
{"text":"Pizza was good, order took about 15-20min to make. Was worth the wait for the type of pizza I ordered"}
{"text":"Great service, always delivering when they say they will. Pizza always hot. Perfect for late night delivery."}
{"text":"The pizza here is pretty decent, but man today when its raptors game 7 they messed up.  I suppose theres mad orders going out but damn they gave me raw chicken bites, knowing myself i'll be turned off chicken for months.  The pizza was cold."}
{"text":"I've had good and bad experiences with this dominoes.  Once we ordered for delivery and they had us waiting two hours. Every single time we called the line was busy. My boyfriend had to drive over and they still hadn't made the order. We cancelled the order and went elsewhere. It's very hit and miss here. (More often they miss) Yesterday we ordered 5 pizzas and a pasta bowl. We ordered their \"future delivery.\" They came right around 5:45 on schedule. I'm glad they didn't let us down yesterday. We did not have high hopes for it.  Hopefully they pull themselves together and become reliable with ordering delivery."}
{"text":"Waited more than an hour for my delivery, tracker was stopped on the double checking process, they did not notify me nor did they deliver the food an hour after. Called up and they told me they are not delivering tonight, only thing they can do is just cancel my order, no food, neither when I offered to go and pick it up. After today (OH, Berea location) I will never order nor recommend this dominos again."}
{"text":"I ordered Dominos after a long day's drive and was looking forward to some delicious food! When my order came, the delivery guy was professional and polite which was great to see as a lot of people in that job are quiet.  Food: I ordered a 2-topping pizza which was delicious! It has been a while since I have had dominos and I was pleasantly surprised. I also ordered the cookie/brownie bars and the cheesy bread. The dessert was fresh, warm and delightful! The cheesy bread however I was disappointed in given that when I opened the box it was buffalo chicken. It was already late and I was tired so I didn't feel like trying to explain my situation over the phone. The chicken wasn't bad at all, I was just set on the cheesy bread.  Overall, dominos is definitely a place I will consider ordering from in the future because their recent company overhaul has really improved the quality of the food."}
{"text":"I ordered pizza for my GF and I. My gf is vegetarian so we ordered a mushroom pizza, when I got back to my place we noticed it was sausage. I ate it but it wasn't that good. I called the place and they were closing but they said they'll put a free pizza under my phone number for my next order. Fast forward 2 weeks I call to order and they say there's no free pizza under my phone number, after my gf yelled at them they gave us a free pie. I've had better domino's avoid this 1."}
{"text":"Background: I've worked for Domino's for nearly 3.5 years as a bonus-winning, five-star delivery driver who is fully cross-trained in every element of driving and working inside as a customer service representative. I say this not to brag (because honestly, who brags about delivering pizza?) but to establish myself as someone who knows how things are supposed to be done.  I recently found myself in Willoughby Hills and wanted something familiar, so I went to the local Domino's. Service was average, specials were sparse - there were only two and one of them was online-only - the store was filthy, and there was a fee for using a credit card on orders less than $10.  After arriving home, I found that one of my pizzas was made incorrectly. Upon calling the store to sort this out, they insisted that it was completely correct - mind you, I know how it is supposed to be - and proceeded to argue with me about it while refusing to compensate me even the slightest for their mistake.  Avoid. There are much better pizza places in town, both local and chains."}
{"text":"We checked out the yelp reviews before ordering for delivery tonight. Although there were a few very bad reviews we decided to give it a shot. That was a mistake.   We waited an hour and a half for an order that was estimated to be delivered at 40-50 minutes. At already over an hour, we checked the tracker to find our food had been cooked for over an hour and had yet to be delivered.   Finally we got our food and not only was the delivery driver was rude, our food was completely cold.   Wasted 30 dollars on cold mediocre pizza and terrible customer service. Don't order from this location."}
{"text":"They moved to a new location down the road next to Starbucks.  I'll keep this review short.  Dominos has lost my business for good!  I've been ordering pizza from there the last few years, since they changed their formula, and have been touting their 'new and improved' pizza.  They were doing well for a while, as their pizza was often tasty. As of late though, their crust is too soft and soggy, and they can't seem to get my sandwich and pizza order right on several occasions.  On their website, one can specifically customize their order, and select (check off) which cheeses or veggies to leave out.  They are incompetent, don't care, or both, given the fact that they included the exact cheese and vegetable that I specifically checked off to exclude on both of the sandwiches I ordered recently.  And this happened on many of my last few, recent orders!  I'm DONE with them, and their incompetence.  NEVER AGAIN Dominos!"}
{"text":"the manager name mike is a real fuck first I call and tell the manger my order of 2 pastas and pizza was wrong then he says would I like to have him remake it and my phone dies and 5 mins Later I call back and then he acts like I never talk to him and I explain everything again then he asks me what's the name I say the name on the order an she says he doesn't see it and then then I I say what then he says I can't help you sorry what a confusing shit head and incompetent im not ordering from this peace of crap dominos again after my confusing experience and the incompetent manger mike I'm never ordering there again"}
{"text":"this dominos is actually cool I had a issue with my order and they took care it no problem :)"}
{"text":"Online awesome price was reasonable 30 min fromy last click to my door! Pizza was good. Thin crust beef n japs! Dude was nice. Hell for $19 bucks what do u want...my mouth is happy"}
{"text":"You guys are seriously amazing. Everything I order, no matter when I order it, is always consistently awesome. I know that's a lot to say about delivery pizza but it's true, they really do pizza here well."}
{"text":"Ordered a Bbq chicken pan pizza and I got a completely raw pizza with raw dough and unmelted cheese. Not to mention all ingredients were flung to one side of the box from the ride over. Congrats dominos, you have my $15 dollars today but you have lost my business in the future."}
{"text":"Not a very friendly place!! Pizza ok. Usually quick Service but short on staff for level of service."}
{"text":"Services is always excellant, prompt delivery, hot fresh pizza.  We order from our place of work and have always been happy."}
{"text":"Great gluten free pizza! It doesn't taste like cardboard and it's not soggy at all. Very impressed since I've tried quite a few.   This review is about the app and how awesomely put together it is. You can order everything you want and then save it in your \"Pizza Profile\". It makes ordering a pizza so easy! It's simple to navigate and it even tracks your order for you! It will tell you when they're making your pizza and when it's time to pick it up. There is also a place to leave encouraging notes! Which I do, obviously. Their carry out special is awesome and I love coming here for lunch on work days.   I would recommend extra cheese on the gluten free pizza though. Gives it a little something....well, extra! Of course bacon, onions, and jalapeños are also a must. If you know what's good. Which I'm sure you do."}
{"text":"This location always runs a terrific pick up special...  Friendly and efficient service, busy location, great menu items, and budget friendly good food.   This location is really a delivery or take out location. They have no seating just a small waiting area.   Otherwise, great pizza place!"}
{"text":"I just went to pick up my custom BBQ sauce, pep, sausage, bacon and mushroom pizza and I had left my wallet at work. The man making the pizza let me pay next time I order. All I can say is WOW. Not only was my pizza delicious, it was also made meticulously. I also work in customer service industry and I really appreciate what this gentleman did. This is not my first time ordering here and they will most definitely expect my order every week! Thank you so so much!"}
{"text":"This dominos always does a great job on my pizzas. Sometimes we pick up instead of getting it delivered and The people who work there are friendly. When we get it delivered, the drivers are always nice and the pizza hot. I usually get pepperoni and mushrooms or salami and mushrooms and the ingredients always taste fresh."}
{"text":"I usually get my BBQ Chicken pizza made by Mo. I use the online order service and it's great!  Mo always gets my order right and on time. I like their thin crust BBQ chicken pizza. Now I've gotten addicted to their chocolate lava cakes! YUM!"}
{"text":"Yuck - I was at the grocery store when I decided I would order Dominos for dinner. Since I ordered it there I decided to wait for it and what a mistake! The employees were running around like chicken with their heads cut off and more importantly - they were not washing their hands! Employees were using hand sanitizer in place of washing their hands after handling money or phone orders. This to me is a big no no and the health department needs to pay this place a visit so they are reminded the rules of food safety!"}
{"text":"Me and my friend called this location around 10:20 and put in an order. Then we were patiently waiting until about 11:45 then decided to give them a call. When we called we were immediately put on hold without even a \"thank you for calling domino's, my name is *insert name here*, please hold\" and waited for close to 10 minutes on hold when I finally decided to hang up and give them another try. Thank god this next time I was only on hold for under a minute. ( I still don't understand how that happens after my first call) and proceed to tell the young lady on the phone how long I've been waiting on my order. She asks me what's the address and I tell her. She then tells me that there is no order for that address in their system. At this point I am beyond frustrated and ask her if there is anything she can do to compensate for the fact that someone has obviously made a mistake here and I know it wasn't me. She says that they can't do anything but put in another order and have it to me when if gets to me. I ask if they could get it to me soon because by this time it's going on 12:00 and she says that she can't put priority on it. Needless to say they need to step their game up for sure on the customer service and on the not losing people's orders end.   Now I did get a response from the owner which was respectable and kind which almost makes me feel bad for my rant. However I'm glad that they took measures to make sure that their customers are happy. Thank you Randy for your response!"}
{"text":"My pizza tasted like it was sitting out for a long time. And just low quality tasting over all. The wings were overly drenched in sauce and two of the 8 I don't think I would even consider wings. Very disappointing probably won't order from this location again. Only reason why they are getting two stars instead of one was because the delivery was fast and the driver was kind."}
{"text":"This location is awesome!!! Always courteous and the food always gets delivered in a reasonable time !"}
{"text":"**-yawn** mediocre pizza, service is okay some days , other days you can tell someone can't wait to go home. . I Only order here when I'm broke..    The drivers are usually cool ( the reason for 2 stars), but the store personnel,  could use some motivation. .  Management needs to step their game up!  (Trickle effect) lived in this jurisdiction 3 years and it's the same ole same ole every time."}
{"text":"I'm not embarrassed to say I love Domino's. Ok, maybe a little embarrassed, but there, I've said it. This location is across the street from me, and gets a bunch of stars for location alone. I tend to have some issues with cheese (darn lactose intolerance)-but the thin crust here, with their mild sauce, does not give me any indigestion whatsoever. I can indulge on their stuff whenever!! I love to add the philly cheese steak on there too, with diced tomatoes. It's a crispy, fun filled combo for me.  Delivery is always lightening fast (probably cause I live so close, but whatever)."}
{"text":"I just called to order carry out and asked if they had any deals. They said they only have deals Monday through Wednesday. As today is Saturday they claimed not to have ANY deals. I know full menu price at Dominos is crazy expensive so I hung up and called the Dominos I usually use at University and Country Club. I asked them what deals they had and they named off about 10 specials.   I hoped this location would be good as it was on my route for running errands. If they can't remember that they always have specials I wouldn't trust them to make a pizza. Going to the other location that was our of my way was worth it."}
{"text":"My wife and I were out on Sunday running around and decided to get the chicken bites from Domino's so we stopped at this location. Ample parking, we parked and walked in. We we're greeted as soon as we open the door by a gentleman behind the cooling racks who was boxing the pizzas. He told us about the specials and said when we were ready to order the girl in front would take our order. It took us about two minutes to figure out what we wanted. Stood there a couple minutes while the girl ignored us completely. Noticing we were still waiting he commented to the girl we were ready. Her response was \" yeah, yeah, in a minute\" with an annoyance in her voice. We looked at each other waited about two more minutes and left. Terrible service from that girl, as we walked out we looked at the guy who was helpful and said \" she can keep her attitude and we will keep our money\" we went up the street to Arby's and had a great lunch."}
{"text":"I haven't eaten dominoes in a long time. And tonight is a reminder of why. They have it down to a science on how to skimp while paying poor attention to execution. My pizza was over cooked burned edges. The pepperoni is micro thin. And the whole thing was like flavored cardboard. In recent years I have been getting pizzas from Costco. The quality,taste,execution and over all consistency are many times better. My domino days are done..I won't tolerate this mediocrity, thank God I picked it up I would have been even more disappointed if I had to pay delivery charge and tip. On a side note I noticed one of the delivery guys cars it appeared that his door was about to fall off of his car...way to go dominos on exploiting the poor to deliver your garbage."}
{"text":"It was one of those nights- I didn't want to cook and I didn't want to leave my sweatpants- cue dominos  1. Order online and find the appropriate coupon- we get the 3 medium 3 topping pizza for $25  2. Pay online or at the door- credit cards accepted at delivery; there's an inclusive $3 delivery charge; takes about 30mins  NB: they don't have salads; their chicken strips and bites aren't my favourite- they're more dredging crust than chicken; it's not the same Dominos chain from the 90s, they've improved!"}
{"text":"Ignorant customer service, I order a pizza and the dough was raw , paid over 20$, and the lady had the audacity to offer me a 5$ credit not even a new pizza. Never going to order from here again."}
{"text":"We ordered pizza here and the girl on the phone didn't seem to know what she was doing. We never received the pizza that we ordered. We will never choose dominos again."}
{"text":"The Manager when this store opened was Corey awesome guy who interacted with customers & his crew well food was delicious... Corey has since left but food is still being served good!!! I've only ever had 2 drivers deliver to us Tony & Brittany, when picking up I'm not sure of there names... Pizzas, pasta, sandwiches & boneless chicken is Amazing!! Oh & Lava Cakes are GREAT!!!"}
{"text":"Domino's has the best online ordering and the tracker is great!!! Cheesy bread is delicious!! They have a garlicky crust and the dough is just thick enough."}
{"text":"Long waits on the weekend and pretty crazy. Pizza is good. Great place to order from during the weekend. I'd look elsewhere in the weekend tho..."}
{"text":"Okay, within the past year I've ordered carryout from here twice. Both within the past month tbh.   The first time I ordered two medium pizzas for $5.99 each. One with no sauce, mushrooms, and feta, and another with regular sauce, bacon, and banana peppers. These pizzas were good, 4 stars.   This time I ordered the same first pizza (no sauce, mushrooms, and feta) and on the second pizza I ordered no red sauce, \"premium chicken\", and hot sauce which they offer as a topping but it's not listed under the sauces. I placed the order online so you'd think there would be no miscommunication. Naw.   Well upon getting home and eating, I realized they put hot sauce all over the \"no sauce at all\" pizza, and didn't even put the feta I had ordered. So a mushroom and hot sauce pizza that I def didn't order or want. As usual very scant with the mushrooms. The other pizza had its chicken and hot sauce but my bf says the hot sauce was way too salty.   Anyway I'm disappointed cause this place is really close by, but I probably won't be giving them another shot for a long while. Consistency is important! This wasn't at a rush time either just in the afternoon and it was ready in like 10 minutes. Which would be nice if they would pay more attention and get orders right all the time not just sometimes. Come on.  Tl;dr you might get what you ordered or you might not."}
{"text":"Sat down and ordered a double pepperoni pizza with regular crust and regular amount of sauce. Sat down and opened the box with excitement as I hadn't eaten today and was getting ready to devastate a thing of beauty. However I was greeted with a circular piece of cheesy bread (because there was little to no sauce). But here's the kicker. I sat down and counted the pepperoni on this thing. 23 slices is not even close to double pepperoni. If it is then I'm sorry for the poor person who gets a large pie with 11-12 slices across the whole damn thing. This has happened twice already and it will not be happening a third time.   Bonus points for gang monikers and references on the chalk wall."}
{"text":"If I could give this place zero stars I would. Food is not typical dominos standards, and the workers are downright nasty. I was also charged for a delivery I did not receive and they refused to refund my money. Absolutely never going back. Save yourself the hassle and go to a different dominos."}
{"text":"First and foremost let me start by saying that I made a Yelp account so that I could write this review, that's how strongly I feel about this Dominos.   Let me set the scene for you: 1:30am I order drunk pizza for my friends and myself. I was told that it would be delivered in 30 minutes. By the time 3:00am rolls around I have no pizza, have called the store multiple times, and am ready to go to bed. Problem is they have my credit card information and I don't want to be charged for a pizza I'm not getting. The store promises that my pizza will be there in 10 minutes, that it will be 50% off, and that I will get a free pizza the next time I call. FINE. Well the guy shows up at 3:30am, pulls my pizza out of the trunk of his car (not from a warmer) and hands me a cold pizza. Whatever. I give him the money and go upstairs. Well apparently the sore didn't communicate with the driver that I was told my pizza was 50% off so he repeatedly called my cell phone and rang not only my apartment's buzzer but all of the buzzers in the apartment complex at 3:00am. He then proceeded to continually honk his horn on the street. As a young woman, I felt very unsafe.   The next day I called the store, was promised my entire order for free the next time I call, and was apologized too. I was annoyed but felt better about the store's attempt to rectify the situation.   When the day came for me to cash in my free pizzas, I called the store, the gentleman asked for my phone number associated with the order, and then claimed to have no record of my phone number. Ever. Harassment incident by the delivery driver aside, I have ordered drunk pizza from this Dominos enough times that there is no way they don't have a record of my phone number being associated with any order.   I will never, ever order pizza from this Dominos or any Dominos ever again."}
{"text":"I love the fact that this Dominos is in my backyard.  When Im in a pinch, to tired, or just flat out lazy, I order carry out from this location.  Dominos makes all kinds of pizzas, and now subs too!  They make thier pizza quick, and you can order online, phone, or walkin.  I walked in last night and placed my order.  The place was clean, staff was friendly and professional.  Those three things keep me coming back for more!  I plan on returning to this location for more pizza in the future."}
{"text":"If I could give negative points I would! Chris the \"general manager\" REFUSED to credit me $21 back for a pizza order that wasn't done. I ordered a pizza on march 27 and had to request another one because the original wasn't done. After receiving another pizza I sent both back because the second wasn't done either and told to driver to just have his manager who I had spoken with earlier issue me a refund. Friday rolls around still no refund so I call and spoke to the same guy. He says he can't refund anything back dated I need to talk to his general manager Saturday morning. I didn't get to call back until today, Chris the general manager basically told me I made the story up and I can't complain to anyone above him because it's a franchise store. NEVER WILL I ORDER FROM DOMINOS PERIOD AGAIN"}
{"text":"Just moved to the area. Ordered quite a few times when I lived in NLV. They did pretty well too but this place was insane. Order looked like the cook realized \"Hey someone is actually going to eat this\" not just like it was thrown together to get it out of the way! Time was extremely fast. Driver \"Marc\" was actually personable and very nice. I could hang with this guy! And to my surprise I actually received the Marinara I ordered. This is a first for sure. Thank You guys! Definitely Paying Attention To Detail! A+"}
{"text":"I will give five star for this location! First of all, it's fast. You only need to wait 20mins or less then your door will be knocked.  Second, it's still hot. You can enjoy a delivery pizza but freshly baked. The last point, good price. Every time I ordered with coupon, such as a large pizza with four topping only $10.99. You can save over $5 for one pizza. Thumbs up!"}
{"text":"On the past two delivery orders, this unit has been below par. On my last order, the pizza departed the store at 1653 and arrived at 1743.  Not quite stone cold, but close enough. On the preceding order, they returned to shop when they could not enter the gate (no call). This facility seems to have some issues.  I suggest Papa Johns or Round Table until (if) they get their act together."}
{"text":"I've never had issues with this place, clean store front, easy ordering, and the carry out deal is awesome!"}
{"text":"There is this beta boy manager named ramon in the kitchen making pizza's with a smelly an arm cast on. fucking disgusting . just fire him already and let someone else work his job . shouldn't be working with a broken arm . saw him yelling and cussing at employees for no reason , the guy is unstable and probably doped up on painkillers ."}
{"text":"I had really bad experience with this location, the cashier was really slow to take my order it took him about 15 min , and they don't even have change to get it to the customers likely i was with my friend he borrowed me a small bill to pay , it was really embarrassing . I don't suggest to anyone to come over here."}
{"text":"Terrible customer service and no longer free condiments...they are acturally charging for parmesan and crushed red pepper. Crazy"}
{"text":"Its been awhile since I had pizza from Domino's Pizza. But last time I ordered was from here. When I ordered last time, it was from here.  The pizza was very good. The garnished it with a generous amount of toppings. Which is always nice. As I hate needing to pay for some extra toppings when there should have already been enough pizza to start with.  Ordering online is always easy. And having a pizza tracker is a nice touch.   Price is not bad for what you are getting.  But I feel they are over priced for their speciality pizzas.   Drivers are do pretty good, but often they fail to being enough of one item or another.  Like napkins or crushed red peppers.   As long as they keep up the good work. I will continue to order pizza from here."}
{"text":"If negative stars were available, this place would get them!!!! Absolute idiots. You have one job and that's to make a pizza and you can't even get that right. Not only were the toppings wrong but they didn't cut it either. I called them and they have very poor communication skills also!!!!! Dominos pizza is horrible anyways!!!! Can't even believe I ordered from there in the first place!!! So much for being close and convenient!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Night started out pretty good. I ordered my pizza from them because these guys are two miles away from my apartment and I get a call back 15 minutes later saying that they can't deliver the food because it's not in their range so that they have to avoid my payment and direct my call to a different Domino's so that they can deliver it but they already charged my card and they said the $30 will be put back on my card in 3 to 5 business days so basically I have to spend another $30 to deliver another pizza to my house when these guys could have did it when they're two miles away. Awful service. Never calling domino's again."}
{"text":"The lava cakes were barely cooked and therefore inedible. The pizza was not bad. Fast delivery."}
{"text":"I ordered some pizzas online.  I had put my phone down for a minute and walked away, came back and I had a call from them and assumed my pizza was ready.  I tried to call back and was on an extended hold .  I get there 15 minutes after they called and the lady told me they gave my pizzas to someone else because I didn't answer the phone.   And that they called six times.  LIAR there  are only four calls on my call list within about a six minute interval.  No voicemail to tell me they're giving my food away.     One of my family members likes it and that's the only reason I ordered there, personally the food is terrible there anyway.  There are an awful lot of pizza places, who needs them."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery about 5 times this year. 5 out of 5 times I never received my sauces. (They cost 50cents each, I order 4 per order.) so congrats to dominos for being the pizza stealing company of the year! ($10 isn't a lot of money but it IS). Hey dominoes why do you sell products but the consumer NEVER gets them."}
{"text":"Now that Dominos makes pan fried pizza, I find very little incentive to pay the Pizza Hut tax at Pizza Hut. Last weekend I caved and ordered a pizza from Pizza Hut, I was left with nothing but eaters remorse.   Dominos is my go to for my pizza fixed. They are very reasonably priced. (9.99 for a two topping med pan pizza), they now offer pasta, which isn't so bad. The only thing I think they could improve on is their wings. Make it like the golden wings from Pizza 73 and I would rate it 4.5.   As for this location, it doesn't disappoint."}
{"text":"I'm from Nebraska and stay here a lot this was the best experience at ordering online I've had here the food was perfectly prepared and believe it or not sit your self down but the order was right when they got it to the door and still hot !!! WOW I can honestly say the worst place is the pizza hatters if ya know what I mean their orders are never right sooooo..... you guys are our new pizza place keep up the good work and don't make me sad I took the time to write this but really good job"}
{"text":"First time ordering chain pizza delivery since i have moved to Las Vegas and i am very satisfied with my purchase! I searched a couple other local chain pizza deliveries but they did not service my area. I am happy Domino's was one of my delivery options because i am extremely satisfied. I had a \"late night craving \" for pizza around 9:30 pm and was able to order a delicious customized pie from dominos. Within 25 minutes i had my pizza in hand. I found the online pizza tracker useful and found it quite accurate. My pizza came exactly like i ordered and was extremely delicious and satisfying. I would suggest this dominos to any locals in the area. Next time i need pizza delivery this location will be my go to. Thanks! Ps the delivery guy was great and was aware of my preferences made on my order. Thanks dominos!"}
{"text":"Pizza is good. Drivers are nice enough. Prices are a bit high though. A simple review simply because there isn't much to say. Not overly impressive but not a disappointment. A decent and reliable place for consistently at least decent pizza and other items. They are also unique in the fact they also serve sandwiches and pasta as well as wings and desserts. I'd recommend. Yet another plus is they deliver, and late.       :-)"}
{"text":"Man they make a delicious pizza. Tastes better and is more affordable for a family than the other non chain pizza places in the area. Their delivery is quick, they have easy online ordering that also tracks the whole process, and they have never screwed up an order. They are also good with accommodating food allergies. And they have a great selection of coupons. Finally their staff are very nice when you come in and really make you feel welcome! Can't say enough good about this place!"}
{"text":"The pizza that I ordered was fresh and delicious!  The pizza was delivered in a timely manner and the delivery person was very nice, courteous and friendly!  I will definitely order more pizzas for myself and family from Domino's Pizza.  Great Pizza!"}
{"text":"One would think that all Domino's are created equally.... nope! This one I on the worst list. The location is hard to get in and out of, no fault of theirs though, I get that. But service is lacking big time.   Our order took forever and the kid behind the counter looked like he was brand new to life. He argued with us about what we ordered, with the receipt in hand he still argued.   Not a single smile or hello when we walked in the door. We felt like we were bothering them.   We will likely opt for the other locations from now on."}
{"text":"Ordered online waited for about an hour. The tracker said it had been out of the oven sitting for over half hour. Called to ask about it and said it should be out shortly. I said well has it been sitting for a half hour now and he said yes but on a heat rack! Why would I want to pay for food that had been sitting out of the over for 30 minutes. Spoke to the manager and he had no apologies. Stay away from here!!!"}
{"text":"Always fast and friendly -even ordered 12 medium pizzas for a party and they whipped them out fast and food always tastes good"}
{"text":"I purchased a pizza for delivery on Aug15th 2016 and they steal your money. Even though i clearly wrote 0.00 dollar tip on the reciept and gave him a cash tip for my 16.00 order he took an extra 5 dollars from me. Mind you i work by desert breeze which is relavtively close to this dominos, not even a mile away in distance. If they can do it to me who else have they done it to. Dont go to this place, unless you want to get robbed!"}
{"text":"Several years ago, I used to really dislike Domino's pizza.  Then one day recently.....     \"Let's get Domino's!\" my girlfriend said.  Apparently, she was a big fan.  \"Ehh, I don't like their pizza too much\"  \"Have you tried their new and improved pizza??\"  shouted my girlfriend.  New and improved pizza?  I was skeptical, but I took the bait.  and wow-wee, I was really surprised.  The new pizza that Domino's started making about a year ago was the real deal.  The crust is the best!  It's like having garlic breadsticks for your crust.  The sauce and cheese has tremendously improved.  Wouldn't call it a favorite, but it definitely wasn't on my \"Do not like their pizza\" list anymore.    Will definitely we eating here more.  And got to say, this location has really good employees.  Always quick with orders and courteous.  I would imagine this is a better branch than most, so give it a try, especially if you haven't ate a Domino's pizza in a long time, the new pizza definitely made me happy!"}
{"text":"One thing is for sure, you know what you're getting when you order Domino's Pizza.  I wouldn't say it's the best pizza by any stretch, but you know all that going into it.  I mean when you're a stranger in a very strange land, sometimes you just call the number on your hotel room swipe card!!  Dominos is kinda the fast-food of pizza... a bit salty, but then you knew that..."}
{"text":"Delivery guy was great, pizza looked great but honestly the taste wasn't there, kind of cardboard tasting dough. Pizza was supposed to be pepperoni and sausage but ended up being two types of sausage, the delivery of the pizza and employees were good though. Don't think I'll order from here again so 3.5"}
{"text":"They always messed up my order!!!! 3rd time they forgot about my GODDAMMNNN GARLIC SAUCE which is I pay extra!!!!"}
{"text":"This is by far my favorite dominos ! Chris and Nick (and the dude in the back) are the dream team of pizza ! They are so full of life and absolutely a hilarious and a joy to be around. Coming in and ordering is something I never do but I'm glad I did and it definitely won't be my last ! Thanks guys !"}
{"text":"Ordered and hour and 10 min ago and was told 30-35. Attempted to call the store 5 times and have been on hold for over 15 min and they close in 10 min. Manager please   Changing my review because the manager Michael was apologetic and was able to compensate for the bad experience"}
{"text":"I love dominos! The improvement in the quality of the pizza is amazing! I always get the thin crust, its less calories and i love the seasoning they put on it. Fast delivery and great service. I always order online cuz it is easier and you dont have to bother them with calling. its faster service to just order online."}
{"text":"I wish I could give this place zero stars. AVOID LIKE THE PLAGUE!!! Ordered carry out here last night. Customer service was mediocre at best. I ordered a medium pizza and wings. The pizza was good and the wings were edible at best. But overall I thought not too bad and even remarked to my friend not too bad for Domino's pizza. I would've even given them 3 stars. It is Domino's after all. Can't expect 5 star customer service and food. However, I don't think that it's too much to ask NOT to get sick. Which I did after eating their food. I ended up going to bed with terrible stomach pains. Finally fell asleep and was woken up by more stomach pain and ended up puking my guts out twice. I didn't expect excellent customer service or even spectacular food. But I did expect NOT to have stomach pains and puke my guts out. You've been warned. Eat at your own risk."}
{"text":"Negative 5 stars. Yooooo horrible service. Dropped my kids pizza and maw them wait For a new one an never came. 3/30/17. I will be there in the morning. Please do not order from here. Please do not order from here they had 4 teenagers waiting for nothing. Tmrw I will call corporate And complain"}
{"text":"The expectations for what you get at Dominos are fairly low. Their business model is high volume and solid value. (As long as you stick to the coupons and promotions.)  Tonight I had a house full of kids,who until they are 25 will continue to think Domino's is great.  So I ordered a togo order on line, paid on line, went to go get my pizza. They were mobbed, i had to wait 5 minutes in the pick up line, so i left without checking the contents of the 4 stacked boxes. Three out of 4 were correct, but there was no plain cheese. I called and was told they would remake me a plain pie.  I get it, Friday night, 100s of orders, minimum wage employees, there are going to be errors.  What chaps me is that they seem so accustom to it. It was 45 minutes from the time i got home the first time to the time i got back with the redo. Totally ruined the flow of dinner and my family time. No apology, no offer to deliver the redo, no mention of it at all. My recommendation is DiGorno. This location is a hot mess."}
{"text":"7/28/16 ordered pizza at 12:40 pm at 1:43 pizza was delivered and cold so we sent the pizza back with the delivery driver. Called the store to let them know the pizza was cold and that we want our pizza, the young guy that answered the phone was ok then he spoke with the manager who said the order would be redone. I instructed him we would be there to pick up the pizza instead of waiting for the delivery driver again. I sent my assistant to pick up the pizza and nothing but aggravation once she arrived.  It is now 2:05 pm and my assistant is just now getting back with HOT pizza. When my assistant asked if we she could have a drink since we were billed for a delivery charge the manager then told her that there is .40 cent difference.  IS THIS A REAL CONVERSATION? WITH SUCH A HUGE INCONVEINENCE YOU HAD THE AUDACITY TO TELL THE CUSTOMER THERE IS A .40 CENT DIFFERENCE.  NEVER AGAIN. AND LET ME TELL YOU HOW MUCH I LOVE THERE THIN CRUST PIZZA. LOOKS LIKE I NEED TO FIND A NEW PLACE FOR THIN CRUST.  I HOPE SOMEONE SEES THIS THAT WILL HELP IMPROVE THIS CUSTOMER SERVICE."}
{"text":"Domino's?  Yeah, Domino's!  Gone are the past days of Domino's sh*tty pizza.  This stuff is pretty dang good now, and their online ordering system (even found on an iPhone app) makes it really easy to customize.  Taste?  Um, really good.  Their pizza with extra sauce and thin crust competes with some of the best tasting pizza I've had in recent memory.    You can also find a great deal online (via coupon) where you can buy two or more medium pizzas for $5.99 each.  Buy several of these and you can end up saving 50% on your family's dinner.  Plus, everybody gets the kind of pizza (toppings, etc.) that they want.  Yes, five stars, and I'm not the only one.  You've tried the others, now go back to Domino's and try them again."}
{"text":"The worst pizza l have had in a long time. I drive by this location to go to my regular place so I decided to give it a try. May be ok for kids but l thought they were skipping on the cheese. The crust had this flavored salt that was too much. The pizzas were oily and tasteless. We will be going back to Round Table pizza next time. They cost more but worth it. Good luck"}
{"text":"Just when You think Dominoes cant Get any better You visit his location. The Freshest WINGS EVER. HOTTEST PIZZA EVER. They brung the Food  very fast. 2 Litre was very Cold. I Dont know about other locations but this One Rocks!!!!"}
{"text":"This place was the life saviour for the dinner @ 1pm. We were trying to find another resturant and were not able to get there and we saw dominos. The staff (nite shift) was really helpful and he let us in once his delivery person came back, as he said the place is not safe so he didnt let us in as he was alone during that time. we were able to get two large pizzas and bread sticks in no time and finally were able to eat the dinner. Dominos you saved the day.:)"}
{"text":"CONSIDER YOURSELF WARNED!  I ordered my pizza at 11:35 am, did not arrive until 12:35 pm.  Where I work is downtown/campus area.  My co-worker and I ordered the artisan pizza with spinach, feta and onions.  I noticed on the Tracker (on the Dominos website) that the pizza had been sitting under Quality Check for more than 20 minutes.  I called and the girl who answered the phone gave me an uncomfortable laugh and stated they were 'busy' or words to that effect.    When the pizza finally arrived, the guy showed up with a pile of pizzas including mine.  He didn't smile and just said 'have a nice day' in a very montone voice.  When I got back to my desk and opened the box...the pizza was stone cold folks!  Thank goodness the pizza was half priced or otherwise I would have been on the phone to whatever manager runs the place.  NOT HAPPY!  Dominos, you need to not only have your place properly staffed on a Friday, but definitely staffed properly when there are half priced specials going on!  You cannot allow pizzas to just sit there until the one, lone guy shows up and grabs a dozen pizzas trying to deliver all of them within a short period of time.  NOT GOOD BUSINESS!  Thumbs down Dominos.  There are too many other places around here who deliver in a timely fashion and offer a much better product.  I will NOT be ordering from this Dominos again.  You have lost mine and my co-workers future business and we will not hesitate to inform others (as this yelp review attests to) NOT to order from this establishment.  One ticked off middle-aged woman who just wanted to eat a pizza...geesh.  Editors Note:  I did call a back from someone in Milwaukee (or the area) in regards to my bad experience.  She sent me a certificate for a free pizza.  I do appreciate the gesture, and I am hoping the next time I order I will be wowwed."}
{"text":"It never ceases to amaze me just how UN-impressed I am when I order a pizza from Domino's.  I guess you get what you pay for.  There's a reason this Domino's is consistently ranked in the bottom tier of their franchise stores."}
{"text":"I ordered from this place, the pizza was horrible and the delivery guy was such pervert !  He was making out with my wife ! I divorced her so she can be with that guy for ever ."}
{"text":"I like this place.   There is really nothing to complain about. Since there is no other good pizza place around the area, I frequently find myself going here. The service is speedy and friendly and I'm always getting a good pie. The restaurant is impressively clean too.   They also offer great specials."}
{"text":"C'mon? It's dominoes pizza for crying out loud!   The pizza is pretty good, awesome for a late night snack, or delivery. A little over priced and the pizza is loaded with tomato sauce, if you like your pizza that way."}
{"text":"First timer at this Dominos and I haven't been to a Dominos in years! It was super late on a Thursday and I was so hungry I ordered breadsticks and pizza. It came super fast and the guy was very polite. I am very happy with the speed of service, the ease of ordering online and my order was completely right! I didn't feel that best in the morning after chowing down a bunch of pizza but it wasn't the healthiest thing so....."}
{"text":"We always order online for delivery, I have never encountered any problems aside from maybe about a year ago when the delivery girl was new and also very slow.  I have always enjoyed the quick service and the food is always on point and hot.  I have always had very pleasant delivery drivers. This dominos is my go to for pizza"}
{"text":"Yaaaaay I love dominos and this one is a super close walk from me so it gets big points for convenience!!! I've picked up pizza from here a few times and each time it's exactly what I ask for and its ready in like 5-10 min!!! so no complaints :D"}
{"text":"I really appreciate the efficiency and quality of Dominos. My order is always accurate, the price is right, and the staff has always been really kind.   The pizza is flavorful, and the variety they offer is pretty great considering it's a pizza chain.   The location is convenient in Cornelius, right off the interstate with an easily accessible place to park."}
{"text":"Service 2/10 Hygiene 1/10 Timeliness 1/10  Preordered a pizza through the online app thinking it would be a quick pick up   i walk up a guy a head of me places order cashier walks away I stand around 6 minutes before being acknowledge so I could pay wait another 3 minutes while he manually types in my card finally get my luke warm pizza.  My biggest knock on this locations is hygiene the work station is so disgusting I almost walked out this wasn't rush hour it was 8 o clock on a Monday and there was at least 5 staff members present. Needless to say I will never visit this location again."}
{"text":"I have to say delivery is way better than going into this location . Delivery was super fast . Last week I went in to place an order and the young lady taking my order had a horrible customer service . I asked about prices and she had a little attitude and as I went to hand her my card for payment she said all sarcastic is that a gift card . I looked at her and laughed and said no .She clearly does not know how to speak with customers .  Overall pizza was yummy"}
{"text":"If you can help it.. don't order from this one.. Ordered wings this last order.. wrong flavor, cold and soggy.  My last order was pizza, and hardly any toppings or cheese.. also cold.. I am across the street!"}
{"text":"They make the best pizza! All the staff is extremely friendly. And it's never a long wait, not to mention they are right across the street from where I live. What else could a man ask for."}
{"text":"Haven't gotten our order wrong once, pizza is always hot, and the Gluten Free crust is better than the plain boring ones! Friendly, fast, and right around the corner from our house.  Two seats at a bar if you're eating in!"}
{"text":"Decided to order pizza one night and used an online coupon for a ~$7.99 large pie for carry out.  It was ready as soon as we got there and we quickly walked home to eat it.  We got sausage as our one topping and it was a little lackluster. Kind of small chunks that tasted just OK. Did not seem to be of good quality.  The pizza seemed different from the last time I ordered Domino's. This pizza had a thinner bottom crust, but the side crust was huge, so much so that it took up a lot of the pizza and one of the slices was easily 25% crust. There also was quite a few air bubbles in the dough, and they seemed generally skimpy with both the sauce and the cheese. Perhaps this was because we used a coupon?  I'm not sure but this time wasn't as good as the last."}
{"text":"I put in my email & phone number before ordering with my debit for no reason. They will not call if you are running behind before canceling your order and putting your money through a 3-5 business day transition. Even it's not company protocol, I feel a manager should have employee call before a cancel like that."}
{"text":"Not the best pizza in the world, but it's pretty good and VERY convenient!   I like ordering online and watching the \"pizza tracker\" so I know how soon my pizza is going to be delivered. Usually it arrives within 20 minutes! I love being able to have it delivered, since I'm too lazy to drive a few miles to pick it up.  Of the few times that I did pick up my order, the staff were quick and friendly. I like the prices too!"}
{"text":"Unfortunately we order here 5-7 times a month. We have had a great experience until tonight. I understand that it is a rainy Friday which would make the restaurant busier then normal but nothing excuses this. First the tracker said that two separate people left 25 minutes apart from each other, each apparently delivering our pizza. This was unusual but I can understand. I called to see why it had been over an hour to receive my pizza. I was on hold for a couple of minutes. Then an employee answered and literally said that \"delivery was over an hour\" then immediately put me back on hold. I hung up after a couple of minutes on hold. . 5 minutes later the pizza came. When it came it literally had no sauce, was ALL crust, and had burnt toppings. It had to have been literally the worst pizza I've ever seen. Imagine throwing something at a wall and then saying it's. Pizza and then throwing it in the oven. So...I called back. The same employee answered again. I explained the problem and he asked if I would like to talk to a manager. I said yes. He put me on hold for 5 minutes again. Then low and behold guess who answers. Same employee!  He said that he would make me a new one or would give me a $10 credit. I said I had two small children who were starving and I gave them some of the crust. I said I would come in to pick it up and that I didn't want it delivered. He then made it seem as if it was a problem that I fed my children some of the crust 80 minutes later. I then said I would just take the credit. He said fine. I asked if there was an apology at all and he just hung up. Ugh.  (Employees name was in the original post but I am hoping they had a bad day so I removed it )"}
{"text":"Buyers beware this is absolutely the worst shit hole I've ever ordered pizza at. I ordered a cheese pizza with extra cheese for my children and came out with no cheese on my pizza just sauce and bread. Where I come from that's called breadsticks with sauce dumbasses. Staff are idiots here. See picture above."}
{"text":"Placed a $70+ order for a team of medical professionals to thank them for what they did for me ..   1. Placed order 4 days in advance ... ORDERED FOUR DAYS IN ADVANCE  2. Called when delivery was already 30-45 minutes late and was told they hadn't even started cooking it yet and didn't know when they would 3. Manager there said \"I don't know what you want me to say\" in answer to the simple question, could you please tell me when you think it will be delivered? 4. It was DELIVERED ALMOST TWO HOURS LATE 5. No accomodation or apology was offered.   NEVER AGAIN - and believe me the medical staff that could be regular customers since they eat pizza all the time .. will NEVER shop there either.   Big mistake folks .. huge mistake."}
{"text":"Placed my order online and the delivery guy was at my door in less than 20 minutes. My order was right and the delivery guy was really nice and friendly. Great experience!"}
{"text":"Worst experience with dominos!!! I ordered my pizza more than an hour ago akd still not here. Waiting on the pizza while i'm writing this. Tried calling the store been on hold for 15 mins. WTF"}
{"text":"We get pizza delivered from this Domino's often. The pizza is always hot, the delivery people are always friendly and curious! We always get a call letting us know when the pie left the store so we have our lights on outside.  I can't say enough good about Domino's website, delivery folks and most of all, their food!!!"}
{"text":"Always good pizza and friendly staff!  For a fast food kind of pizza I've yet not to like a pizza from this location!"}
{"text":"Well I never really write reviews. But the deliver guy was so weird. He was trying to look and see who was in my place. He was so old like in his 70s like seriously... I will never order from here again.. He was way to weird."}
{"text":"We order from this location all the time and it's excellent EVERY time. Always HOT and fresh and made to our specific order. The only qualm I have is the on-line ordering itself and that is not the locations fault. I would like to be able to order xtra mushrooms on my philly."}
{"text":"I like their pizza, I DO NOT ACCEPT their diliveru services. I had a delivery driver admit they spit I their pizzas if you complain, and that he rather work for my company than a company that laughs, gangs up, and spits in their customers pizzas! Avoid this place at all hosts, pizza is trash and customer service is a 1/4 of that. They obviously do not have A reputable manager. Their manager hung up on me after waiting 2.5 hours  every ten minutes I called for our delivery after their call at 1 hour saying they forgot. Skip this place. Obviously they cannot handle surge, delivery, or anything."}
{"text":"Always fresh and hot and fast. Great customer service!"}
{"text":"Poor experience here twice. Two strikes they are out. Inaccurate orders, and burnt food for my second experience. The food was so burnt it had absolutely no taste to it. So disappointed with the taste and customer service."}
{"text":"The pizza we got was amazing! Sooooo cheesy and delicious! It was delivered in under 30 and everything is scolding hot and fresh! I will definitely be back to order again!"}
{"text":"I truly wish there was a no star option because they don't even deserve one ! ....I don't know what I would have to do in order to get my order from this place correct other than go up there and cook it myself !....It never fails my order is always wrong and last time they just completely neglected to deliver everything I ordered!...The manager at this location needs to either be trained or replaced ! ...and the cooks need to learn to read because extra sauce means just that extra sauce not extra dry pizza ! If I say I want oregano and seasoning on my pizza guess what ? I expect oregano and seasoning on my pizza and if you forgot to deliver my items I paid my hard earned money for and I let you know my items weren't delivered guess what I expect you to send someone to deliver them or for you to refund my money , not just steal my money for stuff you haven't sold to me ....This location really sucks!!"}
{"text":"Ordered pizza about a week ago. According to the tracker on the app the driver left at 10:39, didn't arrive at our house until 11:07. Mind you it's less than a 15 min drive if you you hit all the red lights but considering it was late at night I can guarantee there wasn't much traffic. Upon opening our pizza, half of it was stuck to the top of the box. Still tasted ok. The next day I reached out to their customer service. Within 24 hours I had an email reply from the corporation saying it was a privately owned store. No problem. I still have yet to hear from the local store. From now on I will order from another chain (I prefer Pizza Hut anyways) or one of the local Willoughby pizza shops."}
{"text":"I always order from dominos and this time I'm disappointed with how long it's taking for a medium pizza with spinach and mushroom and no cheese like why does it take 30 mins to check for perfection when the pizza only took 12 minutes to make"}
{"text":"I never order from Dominos because I have always felt that it was just cheap pizza. This pizza was incredible. It was perfectly cooked. The delivery was super fast. A guy and a girl dropped off my pizza (the one was training) and they were so sweet and polite. Thanks for exceeding my expectations, Dominos."}
{"text":"Ah Dominos you never disappoint my football Sundays.  I'm not sure if other's value your fast, dependable, yummy pizzas but my kids love it , and so does this busy mom.   This location is always on point and the online delivering is great . Cant beat rewards for each time you order . Thank you for your fast delivery after a great Eagles football win to satisfy my growing teenagers craving for quality pepperoni pizza done right ."}
{"text":"When I learned that they made pan pizzas similar to pizza hut, I was excited (I love the pan pizzas from Pizza Hut). But I should have known that it was too good to be true. Sigh. The pizza was nothing like Pizza Hut, and I could not eat more than a slice. The dough tasted raw and the tomato sauce was overwhelming - sorry, hard to explain. In other words, I was not a fan of the pizza.  Service was good - quick and efficient"}
{"text":"Pizza tasted good until I found a hair in it. Frustrating to spend the money just to throw it in the trash."}
{"text":"I've ordered from this location 3 times. First two times were great. Their pizza has gotten much better and the cheesy bread is pretty good (I mean carbs and mounds of cheese? Sold!) the brownies are utterly disgusting, but other than that no bad experiences. Unfortunately, ordering last night was such a ridiculous experience that I will never use this location again.  Before last night, I've ordered from this location twice using the app (once for delivery and once for pickup).  Last night I placed an order using the app. It quoted 30 minutes to delivery. Perfect. When it got to be over an hour and we still had no pizza, I checked the app to see the status only to find that it said the pizza was delivered. Huh?  I called the Thomas and Central store that the app and confirmation email said was handling our order. The manager (Kevin?) answers and asks for my address, which I give him. \"Oh we don't deliver to you. You gotta call 19th ave and Indian school.\" Never mind the fact this location delivered to us in the past, but whatever.  I call 19th ave and Indian school. \"Oh we don't deliver to you. Your store would be Central and Thomas.\"  At this point, I'm tired of dealing with it, so my husband calls the original location.  First Kevin says they don't deliver to us and he has no order for us.  Then he changes his story and says the driver tried to deliver to us but that he couldn't get in the complex because of the gate. He couldn't call us because the number on the order was wrong (admittedly true- I hit one wrong number typing my digits into the app). However, we do NOT live in a gated community. In fact, the only gates anywhere in our neighborhood is a fenced off empty lot across the street. If you gps our address, Google maps gives super accurate directions, so I'm honestly not sure where the driver went.  Kevin offers to remake the order and redeliver. Okay, let's do that. My husband tells him just to make the same thing we already ordered. \"We can't do that because we have no record of your order.\" Really? So you have no record of the order you just claimed couldn't be delivered?  At this point, I told my husband just cancel the order.   I will not use this location again. All Kevin had to do was say \"sorry, our bad, we'll get that remade and re-delivered.\" Instead, he chose to lie and not own up to their mistakes. That's not the way you treat customers, and now you've lost two."}
{"text":"Everyone at Domino's are motivated, kind and polite.  They really appreciate you as a customer and overall is a fun experience !"}
{"text":"I always have had great service at this location. The last time I went in their machines went down...my only form of payment was credit card. They tried for about 2-3 minutes to get them up to scan my card, when they couldn't, they apologized and instead of making me wait any longer said dinner was on them! Great customer service!!!"}
{"text":"Wow. Pizza comes out of the oven at 7:49/  Leaves the store at 8: 20.  8:32.   Still no sign of my 30 dollar pizza.   Don't buy from here. You'll just end up microwaving."}
{"text":"Dudes...the new pizza is awesome!  I ordered three pizzas, cheesy bread, and chicken kickers for my office team lunch.  I ordered it at 9:30 am for the 11:45 am meeting and the food arrived hot, fresh, and delicious.  The only reason I will not afford five stars is because they brought no napkins or plates...  Love the new sauce, love the new crust, the pan style is awesome!"}
{"text":"I ordered a pizza last night and the driver drove through my yard and left tire tracks and span out and left my yard a disaster NEVER again you suck forest hills dominos I'm contacting corporate about this one"}
{"text":"It's UNBELIEVABLE how many times these guys mess my order up. Time and time again and it's always the same issue. The drivers don't read the labels or whoever is preparing their deliver messes it up. Over and over again. I've been a customer for years and the same problem reoccurs."}
{"text":"Ordered from here on New Year's Day, had the worst pizza experience ever!!! They made a wrong pizza, missing items from my order and worst client service.  My family wanted a deluxe pizza with extra cheese and add on pineapple($12.72), it came with only pineapple on the pizza. Also we wanted chocolate lava cakes($3.98), it was not with the order. So I called them and told them my order was wrong, n the girl tat picked up my call first ask if I want my pizza send over again or a $20credit (to this point I thought it was reasonable as the items comes up to around that price with tax) then she quickly corrected what she said, and said \"no $10 credit\" (just the pizza itself is already over $10), the offer didn't even make sense when it was not my mistake, so I asked to resend my order.  Then later on, she called back and request to have the mistaken pizza back so they can check if it was actually a wrong order or a SCAM!!! This kind of service is unacceptable when they made multiple mistakes on one order and try to blame it on the customer!!! DO NOT ORDER DELIVERY FROM HERE unless you want to get your event and mood ruin!!"}
{"text":"Getting carry out.  They are so slow!  Watching them make the pizza doesn't look sanitary.... none of them wear gloves. They make the pizza and use the phone, walk in freezer, box the pizzas, use the register and I only saw them wash their hands once.  They are defiantly not in a rush."}
{"text":"My family and I have been Domino's fans forever. We were excited that we had one near our house. We ordered a few different times and every single time there was hardly any cheese on our pizza. There was more marinara every time. I told the guy over the phone our problem and he assured me that there wouldn't be a problem this time. We received our pizza and once again no freaking cheese!  I'm not sure if this was done intentionally, but rest assured, I WILL NOT be going back to any more Domino's for a really long time. As I picked up my pizza, the girl at the front was really rude with attitude. I took pictures so I could show them all the times that this has happened but I know they probably won't care or doing anything about it."}
{"text":"Wanted to try this because it so close to home. Big mistake.  Ordered online being very specific and then I follow the tracker that says my pizzas are now in the oven.  Go to pick them up and only one is ready so they have to make the other from scratch while my first one gets cold. Ridiculous.  For my time and disappointment the manager gives me a small bottle of coke.  Really?  So he just lost another customer!  Then my pizza that was only supposed to have 1/2 red peppers has all red peppers.  Why did I bother to specify?  They will make it the way they want. I look at my email now and there is my order form- perfectly filled out just like I wanted, but they could not do this from there.  Maybe they should only take phone orders. Pizza tasted pretty good, at least the hot one did. Overhearing the manager yell to the crew \"let's not have a disaster like last night \"did not give me a hopeful feeling either.  Live and learn from me. No one used GLOVES!!!!  Yuck  Don't go there."}
{"text":"We had the pizza delivered to our hotel room.  The pizza was at the hotel about 25 minutes after I placed the order and was still super hot - we had to wait for it to cool down.  I had ordered the wings to start - DO NOT ORDER WINGS.  Should have listened to other reviews.  They tasted like mush....just horrible.  The pizza was excellent, not the best but for sure not the worst.  Easy meal after a long day and did not feel like going out."}
{"text":"DO NOT ORDER PIZZA ON A SATURDAY NIGHT FROM THIS PLACE! I was very prepared to wait 45 minutes for my pizza considering it is a Saturday.  When I called to get an update after 45 minutes, I was told \"your food has been ready for the last 10 minutes.\" Obviously, that isn't good. Then, he went on to tell me that he will try and get my food out to me on, not the next delivery, but HOPEFULLY the one after that. So I will be using any other pizza company from here on out."}
{"text":"I'm so tired of this location. The delivery driver took my order along with multiple orders for a delivery. I live ONE BLOCK AWAY. Its now been thirty minutes since she left with my order. I call and ask what's up and how I Dont want cold food AGAIN and the man on the line interrupts me saying \"Kay well it's not gonna be cold we use bags to.keep them warm\" I said I'm aware I work at a pizza place this only.keeps them warm for so long and he got all snippy saying if its such a problem to ask for a manager cause IT WONT get here cold.  Last time I wrote a review dominos contacted me to try and fix it. They never got back to. This locations customer service is ATROCIOUS. they are beyond rude. I have never in my life spoken to a customer like these people do.  You've lost a customer for good"}
{"text":"Excellent service, correct order, great prices thanks to a promotion they were doing, and delicious pizza. We usually order from papa John's but thought we'd try Dominos because of their large pizza promotion. I actually liked the pizza here more than papa John's and will definitely return!"}
{"text":"I used the app to order a pizza. I specifically remember ordering two pizzas and picking the toppings for both pizzas and then added on a marble cookie. Instead I got one of the pizzas and two marble cookies. I understand this is not the stores fault it is the app.  The way the manager handled the situation was completely the fault of the store. I called to explain what happened but instead the manager decided to interrupt me and tell me I got what I ordered and there was nothing he could do. I tried to explain that the second pizza was pretty specific and it was hard to forget building that pizza on the app. However he interrupted me again to tell me that I was interrupting him. How ironic. The entire time I was talking very calmly yet he still decided to hang up on me.   I called back because I found that the hang up was completely uncalled for. He continued to yell at me as I spoke to him calmly. He then told me he was flagging my account and I would never receive pizzas from there again. Then he told me if I called back that he would call 911 for harassment.   Needless to say, I'm not surprised that most of the yelp reviews are 1 or 2 stars. This was the worst costumer service ever."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place for pizza because the crust is thin. I love to order the Brooklyn style pizza! They offer amazing deals, and a side that I always love to order is the cheesy bread! SO GOOD! Especially if you switch out the marinara sauce for garlic sauce. MMMMMMMMM. :)  Reason I have it four stars is because sometimes they don't make the pizza well done. And there's no eating area it is just a take out place.Other than that great!   -CL"}
{"text":"It's been a long time since I've ordered Domino's - previous experiences were never good, and this was my first time trying this location. I can't drive due to a sprained ankle and the fridge is empty, so I figured I'd give their sandwiches a try - I figured, how badly could they mess up a sandwich? Today I learned. This was a complete waste of money. Please, if you're reading the reviews, don't think that maybe you'll have a better experience and I just got unlucky. I wish I'd read the other reviews.   The delivery confirmation said it would be about 15-25 minutes for my sandwich and the specialty chicken. In reality, my food was over an hour late. After it finished cooking it sat around for more than half an hour before going out on delivery, another 20 minutes. So I received it 50 minutes after cooking, and it's definitely evident. I could have excused being late if it took a long time before it was put IN the oven, but for it to sit around afterwards is just awful. I should have known when I was handed the boxes and they were luke-warm that this was going to be bad. The cheese on the greasy sandwich has congealed, as has the sauce on the burned chicken. Also, on each side of the sandwich there were three pieces of sliced ham no bigger than a quarter, really? This sandwich is flatter than most paninis! Where's the meat?!  And the chicken. The breading is soggy, and it tastes worse than the cheap frozen chicken you can get at a grocery store. I ate one piece of the chicken before throwing it away, it was literally inedible. I had a couple bites of the sandwich and now my stomach is turning and I feel queasy. At least I'm not hungry anymore - this turned my appetite right off.  Edit - I just threw up. Since I haven't eaten anything else today, this is definitely from the Domino's. :("}
{"text":"I only do the vegan thing now but I use to love the garlic knots and the artisan pizzas. These 5 stars are for their new marketing idea to pave the potholes.  There is one down the street I'm seriously considering planting a saguaro cactus in it. Three neighbors hit it. Never to be seen again. They disappeared into it like Evel Knievel did in his rocket ship into the Grand Canyon. The search party came back three days later and said they found a couple skeletons and several parts of their cars.  Seriously tho, Mayhem from Allstate fell in to it and they are still dredging the hole to do a commercial about it. Godspeed Mayhem we love you man."}
{"text":"The experience was awful. Last week, I saw a deal for unlimited toppings for a large pizza, which got me excited! Waking up hungover on a Saturday morning, my friends and I decided to order pizza. It took 20 minutes to prepare and over an hour and a half to deliver. When it finally arrived, it was cold. I was expecting the cheesy goodness of hot and fresh pizza, but clearly I received disappointment. Will not be ordering from here again and I suggest the same to all."}
{"text":"I have been ordering from this Domino's Pizza the seven years I've lived at 1915 Simmon Street I tried to order tonight and they tell me that they no longer deliver here due to security purposes I have to be punished because my neighbors around me are complete jerks I don't think that's right so if I could give zero stars of this place I would ..."}
{"text":"Worst place to waste money...@ Marlee dominos they made a pizza and it was way too greasy I couldn't eat it..the box was soaking that's how bad it was I called them and they tell me it suppose to be like that...the fuck I've always ordered the Brooklyn style and not once was it this bad in grease and they didn't even offer to replace it!!! And when you place your order and the delivery guy come to your house and demands you for a tip!!Who does service like that... Never ordering from here again"}
{"text":"Wonderful customer service! I had an issue with my order and the Manager Dave took care of us! They definitely take care of their regulars.  I give them 10 stars!"}
{"text":"These a-holes. Never order food from this place. Ever. You never know what will show up in the box. Trust me. Don't eat food from this place!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Updating review.  Another perfect review ! Just have to add that this place remains consistent.... pizza is perfect (always pan pizza for my order), fresh, hot, and quick.   App is amazing to track status.  Never late.  Never an error on my order.  Pizza perfection IMO."}
{"text":"Literally worst dominos location. I wish I could give it 0 stars. The delivery driver, Frank, is an idiot. If you actually want your food to arrive, order pizza from somewhere else."}
{"text":"First things first, don't order from here. The service is just as bad as the food. Okay, maaaybe a little bit worse.   Im not sure if they still have the same crew working there or not but Daisia, the girl who answered the phone, should work somewhere else or go to a Customer Service class. I called and she answered with \"Can I put you on hold?\" then didnt wait, just put me on hold. A couple minutes later she took my order like she has waaay better things to do and completely disregarded my request to get a phone call when the delivery man was outside my door instead of a knock. Of course the delivery man came to my door and knocked loud enough to wake everyone up and get my dogs to bark up a storm. He said he wasn't told to call and then slammed my screen door. So I called the store again and miss Daisia answered with her 'hold' greeting and when I asked to speak to a supervisor, he apologized and said there was \"nothing he could do\". I hung up and proceeded to just eat my food and put it all behind me. But the bread was still VERY doughy and the pasta was so hard, it was crunchy. I threw that crap away. I made sure to get my refund but wow, you guys suck!  I tried giving them a second chance but the food came out just the same and the daytime manager was rude enough for me to write my first bad review on here. Apparently all the breadbowls come out doughy unless you call to let them know you want it cooked all the way through. Maybe if I order wings they'll deliver a dead chicken and tell me I shouldve called to have it cooked instead."}
{"text":"Talk about huge improvement!  I rarely say commercials are right, but in this case, they turn out to be true. Domino's has some great pizzas and menu items now. Try it."}
{"text":"I ordered a pizza from this store and the first problem I ran into was that they did not offer paper plates.  I am staying in a hotel so how am I supposed to eat them off the floor.   That is very cheap of this place to not offer paper plates.  Also their prices and delivery charge are quite high for not offering plates or the type of product they serve.  Their delivery charge is way to high.  If the owner is cheap and others are like him are in other locations I will avoid Dominos all together.  What do you mean any delivery charge paid to your driver is not a tip.  I am sure they get some of it for so called gas.   My tip I will leave is lower the delivery charge and have plates and I will tip generously.  Otherwise why should I give a monetary tip.  Dominos should give drivers delivery charge and be open who gets it and where it goes.  They are so secretive about it and it would behoove them to tell us what delivery charge is used for."}
{"text":"::::::       ::::::             ::::::       We looked at our entertainment book for pizza coupons and came across Domino's in some cruel twist of fate.  Since we hadn't had Domino's in easily 10 years and it was a pretty good coupon we decided in what later seemed a momentary lapse in judgement that we would use the coupon and give them a shot.  It will likely be at least 10 years before we try them again.  Pizza that was on a par with those frozen ones from the grocery store and a free sandwich we shared that left us with tummy aches.  Despite the coupon savings it's no deal for poor quality food."}
{"text":"They made me wait 50 minutes for 1 large pizza. When I opened the box, the cheese wasn't melted properly, the marinara sauce was overflowing, and there was barely even any toppings on it. Very unsatisfied with this dominos. I tend to eat quite a bit of dominos but this was by far my worst experience with it."}
{"text":"This store is a joke. I ordered a pizza online, the way I wanted it of course, but when I got there to pick it up for some reason it was not at all what I ordered. The employee working there proceeded to tell me that that's what I ordered, he just makes the pizza and he didn't know what I wanted him to do about it. He was rude, insensitive and when I asked if he could remake the pizza he turned around and walked away from the counter. So I walked out. Never again will I order a pizza from that location. Such rude and careless service. Yeah because that makes me want to come back. Unbelievable."}
{"text":"I'm painting my living room and have no time to cook, I can't say this is reviewable its dominos... The delivery guys are really friendly and courteous."}
{"text":"This dominos use to be amazing up until about a year ago. Every time I order a pizza, they never put the garlic sauce on my crust. That sauce is one of the main reasons y I order dominos in the first place. This last time, I called them to complain and the girl I spoke to said she put it on there herself. Hell no u didn't. I'm not ordering from them again. It was late at night and I'm just sure she said that so they wouldn't have to remake it. That's ok though. Lost business.."}
{"text":"Gotta love pizza.  They make their pizzas from fresh dough here unlike most other pizza places.  I always get great service here so I have no complaints lol The store is clean and nicely decorated."}
{"text":"Ordered 2 large carry out pizza - 1 brooklyn style and 1 hand tossed. We ended up getting the wrong pizza. We got 2 hand tossed pizza and different toppings from what we specifically ordered!!   Its very important to check the pizza before leaving the store especially in this location!! Worst location ever!"}
{"text":"I ordered two 3 topping pizzas, one had teo toppings on it and one had 4 toppings, they both had the wrong toppings on them as well and the pizza wasn't very great overall lmao"}
{"text":"Better than our near by Papa Johns.  We receive our pizza orders fast, food is hot and drivers are nice!"}
{"text":"Dominos changed there sauce recipe (go back to the old one please), so not my fave anymore. The sandwiches have been good, the pasta bowls on the hearty side, however, the pasta itself lacks seasoning (may need salt and pepper).   If you're ordering a delivery on a busy night, i.e. weekend - football season, the wait is long and your order may not be correct (happened x2).    Dine-in is good, as the resturant is clean, and you get to watch them make your food - glass seating area."}
{"text":"So far that I been ordering from here it's been alway great service with delivery and pizza is just the way I like it."}
{"text":"Thoroughly surprised at how good their pizza was for a Dominos!  I received a free pizza coupon in the mail.  First of all, I was completely shocked by this--a free pizza! No catch?  No catch at all!  It was a free large pizza with ANY AMOUNT OF TOPPINGS!  I asked that they make the pizza with extra sauce, extra cheese and extra well done.  I also opted for the garlic crust.  I was extremely surprised at how good the pizza was and how tasty the garlic crust topping was as well.  However, if I had to pay retail price for the pizza, not sure I would go back to Dominos.  I'm not sure if it just tasted better because it was free!! If I get another coupon, I'll go back."}
{"text":"Ordered plain stuffed cheesy sticks with 3 marinara sauces (because I had to meet the minimum delivery they enforce), it got here pretty quickly and I opened it up to find they were the jalapeño bacon version with no marinara. Called the store and the guy said \"oh...well...do you want us to remake it?\" To which I said \"yeah, I can't eat it I'm vegetarian and also it's not what I ordered and there's no sauce with it.\" They said okay, offered a free drink, all good they were bringing the right order. Just got delivered and they are now plain stuffed cheese sticks which is right but there is only 1 marinara. Their minimum delivery amount made me spend more money on these stupid marinara packages and then the second time they deliver to me to fix their mistake of a completely wrong order there still aren't as many as they made me buy! Come on guys."}
{"text":"My rating is 3.5 stars.  This Domino's Pizza is located on the southwest corner of Brimley Road and Steeles Avenue East. What seems to be eons ago, there used to be a TD Canada Trust on this tiny corner.  I felt like pizza and wings one day. I bought a large pizza with three toppings (sausage, chicken, and onions). I normally don't do chicken and sausage together, but I wanted more protein. The pizza was good. It had a decent amount of ingredients. The crust was yummy and didn't make me lose my real teeth biting into it. It's a pass for me.  I also orders some honey garlic wings. They were more peppery than I had wanted. I also didn't like the foil glued to the box. I ended up ripping it and the honey garlic sauce went oozing onto the box. Ah, what fun!  I definitely prefer Domino's over Pizza Pizza. I am glad that this location is within walking distance from my home.  The downside to this little corner of stores is that there isn't a whole lot of parking. It's doesn't matter to me because I just carried everything home. However, if you have a big order and parking is limited, it could pose a problem.  (136)"}
{"text":"Great pizza,service, and prices. Have found my go to place after searching for months"}
{"text":"I get pizza from here often and it's usually fantastic. However their pasta, as delicious as the toppings are, is very dry - even when I request extra sauce.  Go for the pizza and bread sticks and you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I did an online order for \"50% off a regular price pizza if ordered online\" and I did so for Carry Out, I ordered a large 3 topping and the total was $11 it said I saved $10 meaning that pizza WOULD have been $20 without the promotion.   When I arrived there I saw a big sign on the window that said \"Large 3 topping for Carry Out: $7.99\" as I looked at this sign before I could even say anything Tyler the associate who helped me said \"don't worry I already marked it down for you to that price\", I was very appreciative towards his honesty and understanding.   When I ordered, I got veggies because I can't eat meat, have not in 5 years so doing so could cause me to get sick, when I got home with the pizza I notice Bacon on it, at this point I can not eat that pizza.  When I call over there to let them know, the first thing Tyler said was \"I apologize sincerely for that mistake, I want to make sure you are taken care of\" ...wow, now that is what I call customer service! He ended up taking care of the situation in a more than satisfactory way!  The point I'm making here is that even though there were two blunders here, (it happens to everyone sometimes), the associate Tyler made SURE to fix them and make me happy. For that I WILL be returning to this location again.  Thanks for the awesome customer service Tyler, that's all I can ask for man!"}
{"text":"Ordered from this location for the first time tonight. Was SO surprised when our doorbell rang 20 minutes later!!!! Super fast, kids loved it, AND so did my very pizza-picky husband!"}
{"text":"We ordered the 14-inch large pizza with 2 toppings for $5.99 on two different evenings.  1st order was Extra cheddar and Roaster Red peppers. It was excellent. The edges were brushed with garlic oil. They also charge 55 cent for their little dipping sauces. Come on guys, don't make yourself look that cheap. The cost of that sauce to you is almost nothing, give it away.  2nd order was supposed to be with Feta cheese and Spinach. However, they added onion too by mistake and did not say anything to me about it. Instead, they just tried to make me not notice that. They gave my box with hoping that I would not notice the unwanted onions so that they do not need to make it again. They were lucky as I opened the box at home and did not bother to call back. Instead I had to separate the onions piece by piece from inside the cheese. I could not enjoy my pizza. I also could not get the taste of 2 toppings enough. So, the toppings were insufficient. They did not bother to brush the edges with oil this time.   Not sure if I will go back again, especially if they do not offer specials.  By the way, this was my first visit to Domino's in years. I noticed that their store was super clean and organized. The 2-story oven was looking great too. Their menu was on a big flat screen, ready to display dynamic menus. They make the pizzas near to the front so that customer can see them from side. They seem to be prepared to knock the competition down."}
{"text":"I waited in the Independence store location for over 30 minutes during which I listened to the manager say they had sent out over 7 wrong orders within the hour and customer are always wanting to get something free. I figured she may have been having a rough night so I let it go to later receive an order I didn't ask for. After waiting forever it wasn't until I got home that I realized my order was incorrect I also noticed it wasn't eatable either (please reference photo). I tried to call the store multiple times to see about it being replaced but no one ever answered the phone. Hands down the worst customer service and good I've ordered!!!"}
{"text":"The pizza from here has always been good. Wings too. Make sure you call because they sometimes have specials just at this location."}
{"text":"I was really disappointed when I ordered here. I placed an online order and I thought the dominoes tracker was really cool. But when 30 mins passed by after the dominoes tracker said it was being delivered by Jose I  called to see when my pizza would arrive. The girl on the phone told me it should be any min but any min turned into 10 mins. When the driver arrived it wasnt even jose it was a different person. After she gave me my order she told me that their printer wasn't working so she didn't have my receipt. Really? When I got my pizza it was already getting cold and so was the boneless chicken. So much for getting it fresh. First and last time I order from this place."}
{"text":"HORRIFIC beyond words!  Rude, inconsistent, poor product delivery, HAIR in food!!!  The manager, Sarah, is condescending, rude and cares nothing about the customers.  My last order I had to call another store to go over the management for what seemed a deliberate attempt to make me ill.  In past they gave me wrong numbers for corporate on purpose!  Had several issues with orders and treated disrespectfully when placing a next order trying to use a credit THEY were to issue for THEIR mistakes.  Not only did I bite into a VERY LONG hair in the pizza I threw up shortly after and had stomach issues the rest of the night.  Crude and nasty!!!  By calling another store on Tatum they were shocked and apologetic and immediately gave me a REAL phone number to resolve my issues.  STAY AWAY from THIS location!  Mortifying!  They should ALL be fired and NEVER allowed to work in the food service industry again!  DONE with ALL Dominos for LIFE!  WORST ON THE PLANET!!!!!  Negative ten billion stars!  Shame on you!!!!!"}
{"text":"They was fast , the delivery guy was very friendly, pizza was just like I wanted it"}
{"text":"This is our go too spot for Pizza in Toronto. We usually like independent pizza restaurants. This location does it perfect every time and takes time with quality. I would never review a chain, but had too for this spot."}
{"text":"Ordered a bunch of larges for a class party for 2nd graders.  Asked to have pizzas double-cut.  When they came, they were not cut straight.  Knowing the pizzas are for kids to each have an equal slice, the pizzas should be as perfectly cut into 16 skinny pieces and not some 5 inches huge  and some one inch strip.  It causes negative issues to have kids picking about size of slices. Would have been nice to have them cut nice and evenly."}
{"text":"This is why I'm against minimum wage being raised, because of places like this. Twice, they fuck up a simple order. Is it that hard to read, and place stuff in a box or bag? Idiots should not make more than educated people. Piece out Dominoes, you just lost a customer."}
{"text":"If I could rate this location 0 or negative stars I would.  Ordered food at 8:37pm and it didn't arrive until 9:56pm after the site said 20-30minutes delivery time.  When the food arrived it was lukewarm and dried out.  I called the manager and she stated there is a glitch with the site and if I had called in to order she would have told me delivery time is 50minutes.  I explained the temperature of the food to her and she stated well at least it wasn't cold.  I asked her to refund me and she stated she could remake the food and it would take 30 minutes to arrive, I stated that at this point I didn't want the food and wanted a refund.  She then raised her voice at me and told me she would offer a free bread bowl or parmesan bites on my next order.  I explained I would not order again and asked to speak with an owner she directed me to 1-800-Dominos which was no help at all.  Avoid this location!"}
{"text":"I wasn't able to get my order tonight cuz they had no driver? I was pretty bummed! I only order dominos cuz the food is decent and I can order late cuz I work late.  I placed my order and as I was waiting I got a call from the manager that they weren't able to deliver cuz they had no driver on duty. Wtf?"}
{"text":"I always try to give places second chances but this is the last time I come to this dominos. I did an order online and selected to pay in store. My husband arrives and calls me back to tell me they're not accepting credit cards/debt cards. Ok out of courtesy you could've called when you saw that I selected pay in store and check with me about how I was going to pay and let me know that it was cash only. Now my husband is driving back home with no pizza."}
{"text":"Online ordering is wonderful and easy!! I like being able to watch where in the process our pizza order is -- and this location is fast and always gets it right!  Salads would be a wonderful addition, though. ;)"}
{"text":"Awful customer service. Pizza arrived late and very cold and missing part of the order. Manager refused to refund money because it was a \"process.\"  After arguing with me for 10 minutes and lying to me he said he would sent the driver back to pick up the bad pizza. What???  Ok, come and get it, please. Good luck if you order from here."}
{"text":"Very reasonable and tasty pizza. They have a lovely thin crust that we really enjoy. The service is really good and the employees are very nice. We try fancier places but always end up back here."}
{"text":"This is the worst dominos I've ever been to. I would give it no stars if I could. Manager is EXTREMELY rude, and all the employees are always joking around and cutting up every time I go in. I went in recently told them my name, she went to the kitchen and then came back five minutes later after I could hear her cutting up with one of her coworkers. Will be getting papa johns from now on, much nice employees and better food!"}
{"text":"Andrew was awesome. My wife asked about mothers day specials and although there were none available, he said he would do his best. The pizza arrived promptly. When I opened the box, \" Happy Mothers Day\" was written. He also threw in a garlic dip because my wife asked if it was as good as a compeditors' . You know, such a seemingly small thing can boost your business SO MUCH!  Customer service and a personal touch do not cost much but this gesture will ensure repeated business from my family. By the way, we normally order delivery about 4 times a year. This was the 1st time we ever ordered from this store. It will not be the last. Great job Andrew!"}
{"text":"Domino's pizza is a fast delivery and always reliable, but lately this location has been letting us down. Our last TWO orders have BOTH been wrong and when we called to complain the service has not been stellar.  First they forgot the pizza toppings we ordered and paid for and told us we'd get a free pizza next time but hung up without telling us how to redeem it - we had to call back to find out!  Then we called because they forgot the sauces (that they charge for) to go with our cheesy bread and got nothing but attitude. Small mistakes but not handled poorly. Maybe next time we'll order from Spinatos via Ubereats."}
{"text":"Great Domino's App love it. Pizza and service is always top notch. They get 5 Stars for being consistent. Price, quality, convenience, and easy. We love Ahwatukee and someday will branch out and try another pizza place, but Domino's is a great go to."}
{"text":"I order from this Domino's location at least two times a month since it is close to where I live. I use the online ordering system, and it Is simple. There is a pizza tracker that shows you who makes your pizza, and when your pizza will be delivered. In the past, I had ordered a half pepperoni, half cheese pizza, but got a full cheese pizza. I called them, and they offered to deliver the correct one right away, however it was just me so they gave me credit for a free pizza the next time I ordered. I just ordered pizza on Sunday, and it was tasty, but a little too saucy for my liking because it made the crust soggy and limp. However pizza is pizza, so it was yummy in the tummy. The delivery drivers are always friendly, and smiling. This location is definitely my go to pizza place."}
{"text":"I've been ordering from this location for about the past year or so. They always deliver the pizzas fast and always yummy. It has become my go-to place for ordering pizza. I always order online and I like how they show you the status of your order as its processed"}
{"text":"Typical 'franchise' style pizza. If  you are going to order from the this location, go with the 'Brooklyn Pepporoni stye thin crust'. Other than this one, the rest of there menu is just like any other pizza place. Personally their pizza seems overpriced compared to some smaller independent establishments."}
{"text":"Bad Customer Service all around! Waited forever on my food , finally got a call after 1hour and 30minutes that they\" needed to verify the order and address\" . I have been ordering from that place for awhile. Andrew on the phone didn't care to get my food to me asap , didn't get an apology, nothing. Just indifference .Cancelled my order. He didn't care about that either. Go figure."}

{"text":"hello avid pizza goer here. i must say this pizza establishment is the worst kind of domino's. you could say the domino's have fallen. well let's start with the simple condiments section. i simply asked the sir, the good sir, for some pepper and cheese packets. as these are standard condiments in the pizza industry, i'm sure. now this gentleman told me that these packets were DISCONTINUED. why in the name of papa john's would you \"discontinue\" pepper and parmesian cheese packets??? is this not pizza? are we not in italy? i think this domino's needs better management and the hell, why don't they claim this address? are they that ashamed of the bad service, quite teribble per se.   hello"}
{"text":"Extremely slow delivery times.  Quoted 32 minutes and it arrived in 73.  Called the store around 50 minute mark and they said there was nothing they could do but just cancel the order.  Offered no apologies and extremely unfriendly.  Absolutely ridiculous.   I will never order from them again."}
{"text":"This is the location closest to my house and I always get carryout from here.  I have never had a problem with my food or the service.  In fact, the employees here are exceptionally nice and outgoing.   My pizza is always ready in a reasonable amount of time and have never had a cold or messed up order.  Delivery takes a little while, but nothing out of the ordinary."}
{"text":"Call in order,  put me on hold 5 minutes. Finally ordered food.    Arrived to pick up food and was told that I ordered for the following day.   I ordered for the day of.   Female member of staff finally figured out her mistake  They took 30 minutes to figure out the order.  Offered nothing for not being able to do their job.  Food was as ordered when finally ready.    Never again at this location.  Bad staff"}
{"text":"Not many pizza places have impressed my family and I recently, especially Pizza Hut.  As far as I'm concerned they went downhill.  But when we tried Domino's, we were surprised how good it was! We heard many negative things about Domino's, but it's some of the best pizza I've ever had! It tops those fancy expensive pizza places even! The Parmesan cheese bites and the Wisconsin 6 cheese pizza is absolutely delicious!! Will definitely keep eating here and highly recommend it to anyone."}
{"text":"Ordered a Pacific veggie pizza No Onions Please! Sure enough ,there were onions on it. Domino's has'nt changed, and their crust still sucks. Try a little harder next time. A pizza order can get much simpler than that."}
{"text":"An hour and a half....for a SALAD! This store is 7 min away from where I am at. I had to cancel and I am waiting for the payment to come back into my account."}
{"text":"Braden is fa...ntastic employee. I have order the gluten free pizza, and let me tell you ( Bernie sanders voice) it's just the best pizza I've had. Each time I go Braden is able to suggest unique and delicious combinations to enhance my pizza eating experience."}
{"text":"The fastest service ever ! Awesome place! Just ordered online for carry out and it was done in 10 or 13 min."}
{"text":"'This is the best Dominos EVER! Great location - SUPERIOR SERVICE & the pizza & garlic twists are so good! The people who work here are super kind and take pride in their store!!"}
{"text":"Worst customer service ever! The manager Jason is very rude and doesn't take ownership for HIS mistakes. Screwed up our orders 2/3 times we've ordered there. Won't be giving them business again!"}
{"text":"Worst service ever they made up a story about getting a new oven in please! !! Make the order lazy asses!!"}
{"text":"I don't expect much when ordering Dominos but seriously...  The images speak for themselves."}
{"text":"I have to agree with Kristin on this one - she pretty much said it all. This Domino's is fast, employs really friendly delivery men, and always delivers the food hot. Plus, they have online delivery, which is super easy and convenient - when you place their order, there's an online tracking system that lets you know when your order has been processed, your pizza is in the oven, and when the delivery guy is leaving  the store and heading to you. Of course, there is better pizza elsewhere, but South Phoenix doesn't have many good delivery options (even for the ever-popular pizza), and this Domino's great service and fresh, hot pizza makes it a pretty good option where cooking or going out aren't desirable or possible."}
{"text":"We ordered 2 medium pizza on Mother's Day. Didn't finish till Tuesday night. I found a tiny hair inside the pizza while feeding my son. Called up the place the guy said he couldn't do anything bout.  Really???   I'll definitely call corporate and health district on them. Horrible customer service and disgusting food."}
{"text":"The nicest group of people work here! Thanks so much, Diego & me order here all the time!"}
{"text":"I order from here often, my food is always fresh and delicious! My delivery guy is alway on time! Happy customer."}
{"text":"Is there anything less than 1 star. The pizza never got here - ordered hours ago. Called after the first hour and a half and was told 15 minutes. No pizza. Then called at the 2 hour mark and after expressing frustration, we get an \"I know, how about I get it there in 10 minutes\". LOL. Ridiculous. Dominos sucks. Thanks for nothing."}
{"text":"I guess I should've checked the reviews first.  The pizza was like something out of the area grocers frozen food section and the wings so small I was concerned if they were even chicken. .. The overabundance of sauce seemed to be aimed at distracting us from their size.    To say the least and $30.00 later I won't be calling ever again!"}
{"text":"Worst location ever!!! Ordered a pizza last night n it didn't get delivered until 45 min after they left the store with it. What's the point of hanging a tracker if you're going to take forever?? It doesn't take 45 min to get from dominos to my apartment. It takes 10 min!!! Then when I ask the delivery guy what's going on? He said \"it's a long story\". So that's acceptable? No. When I called the store to speak with someone about my pizza being so late, they didn't even care. All they said was \"I don't know why he's late.. he should be there any minute. No I'm sorry or anything like that. It's just unbelievable how nobody cares about customer service. I'll never order from here again!! But then again it doesn't matter or I'm sure this establishment doesn't care to change anything because so many people continue to order from here. They don't care if they lose customers. If I could give no stars I would. Thanks for your great customer service dominos!!!"}
{"text":"Underestimate on the delivery & overpromise on the food. How many times do I need to say \"no onions\" yeah. Mutual Blacklist"}
{"text":"The latest commercials proudly tout that Domino's is slowing down the process of making pizza to ensure it's done properly and to be as quality a product that it can be.  Apparently, this location didn't get the memo.  I had received a text message with a coupon code that was a pretty good promotion. Being sleep deprived on a Saturday after a long week, I was easily compelled to take advantage of the offer. I used the Droid app to compose my order. (Sidenote: The score I'm giving for this review was not inveigled by the app either way - I just figured I'd throw it in for anybody interested.) The app was streamlined nicely and pretty straightforward. Granted, it's not as if you need to have your hand held to order a pizza, but the flow and logic make it even easier. I didn't bother with the order tracker. It's going to get here when it gets here - nothing will change if I track it or not. It's not a FedEx shipment or anything.   Delivery arrived quicker than the ETA I received upon checkout.   Aside from the pizza, I also ordered Chicken Alfredo pasta. Needed a little more sauce, but it was just fine coming from a chain pizza place. I wasn't expecting homemade Italian fare.  The pizza, however, was an entirely different story ...  It looked pretty appetizing, and had a good amount of cheese. I ordered the hand-tossed pan crust. It didn't take anything more than the first bite to realize that the dough was pretty undercooked. Definitely; well, doughy. It wasn't just a little bit undercooked - it was raw dough. The fact it was pretty light and airy helped a little bit, but I barely got through the tiny slice I started out with - mainly because I was hungry enough to make it through; hoping the crust would be enough to nominally quell the growls of my depleted stomach.  I pulled each of the remaining slices to make sure it wasn't just the one slice I picked. That wasn't the case. Pulling them apart, the raw, sticky dough stretched out as if it were melted cheese.  I plan on contacting either a manager or franchisee shortly - the review will be updated accordingly to reflect the level of customer service in how they react and deal with the complaint.  Again, the increased ad campaigns have tried to connote that Domino's is focused not on speed, but meticulous quality. While this may very well be this particular location - especially considering the average score from fellow Yelpers - it's very likely this experience will detract me from ordering Domino's again; regardless of location."}
{"text":"I normally wouldn't write a review on a fast food place, but it was that bad. Got my order almost 3 hours after ordering, it was free but still. Kinda ridiculous"}
{"text":"I've always ordered at this location. So I ordered last night around 8:00. I ordered 3 medium pizzas. One of them was a pan pizza. I start to eat then was doughy & warm inside. So I called the location back and they said they remake. They did remake alright but ended up giving me a burnt pizza back. Who wants a burnt pizza. Nobody shud get burnt pizza back. They didn't apologize or nothing. All they said is \" I seen her make the pizza and put in oven\"."}
{"text":"Pizza was delivered quickly and correctly!  Shelby, the manager even went through the great specials they had going on for me! Great customer service and fast delivery!!"}
{"text":"Placed an order online successfully using their app. Tried to call the store to change the time to an earlier time but had to wait 18 minutes on hold before someone decided to pick up the phone. They were gracious enough to change the order time but when I came to pick up the pizzas a few minutes early and brought them home they were cold. The pizzas must have been sitting there a while since I only live a quarter-mile away."}
{"text":"Its Domino's. The service was on-time, and very friendly. But, it's just Domino's, so the pizza was basic and served the need for a house full of last minute guests."}
{"text":"Picked up a call in order here. I was impressed by how quickly the phone was answered, I wasn't placed on hold, and my order was communicated correctly the first time. When I arrived, my pizza was ready and correct. This location has been remodeled and it looks great. There was a neat digital board that showed where your pizza was in it's cooking process. All of the people working in somewhat of an assembly line reminded me of Snow White and the 7 Dwarves. Then there was the evolving door of delivery drivers. This is a very busy place on a Friday night. The final taste was my pizza. I had a thin crust with pepperoni and mushroom. It was \"okay\". Nothing to write home about, but standard for Pizza Hut. Could use more sauce. Good quick choice for a Friday night."}
{"text":"Awesome pizza that really made my night. It was made perfectly and tasted delicious. I used the Domino's Tracker and it worked very accurately. Through the app I was able to see when and where my pizza was and submit feedback on my experience. I will definitely be ordering from this location again."}
{"text":"This dominos is amazing!!!!! I used to hate dominos, but Now i love it! They make there Orders right and you get your food Fast and its sooo good!!!!!"}
{"text":"online ordering experience! naaa!  take 18 min. wait for the e-Mail to see if my order it's ready!   no napkins.Customer service was super bad? mmmmm.... naa too bad! entire box was greasy!  Well this is a pizza place!!  NOT haute cuisine!!!  no needs plates, forks and bla bla bla, just go to another fu.. restaurant and fix the problem! it's not caesar palace pizza!!!"}
{"text":"Terrible people work here who will steal your money. I ordered pizza on May 11 2018 and after waiting over 1 1/2 hrs for my order to be delivered I called to ask what was going on. I was told that because of the pirates game they were doing their best to deliver in a timely manner. I told them I no longer wanted the pizza and I wanted a refund. It is now May 30 and no refund. I have contacted corporate and they are no help. They just referred me to the store. I sent a follow up email and got no response. I have called the store directly twice since the 11th and have gotten the same answer: that they submitted for the refund but it takes 3-5 business days to show in my account. All lies! I'm sure these scumbags just never canceled my order and are hoping I just let it go so they don't have to eat the cost of undelivered pizzas. Too bad for them I'm never going to stop hounding them until I get my money back."}
{"text":"We order 2 pizza's here every other week. Same types of crust, same sauces, same toppings.  Two weeks ago they reversed the orders and it was awful. I called them immediately to complain but they wanted us to drive back. It was late and I hate to drive.  I told them I would try then again in two weeks. I called and placed my order with \"Travis\". He looked at our previous order and fixed it while I was on the phone.  I highly recommend them."}
{"text":"This location (Marks) is awful. Slow delivery, rude drivers, manager seems very weak, basically a 0 star if you could rate it that. I'll take my business elsewhere, I gave these guys too many chances and they failed miserably every time."}
{"text":"Ordered Parmesan twisty bread for the 2nd time this week. They are either well done and tough or this time they arrive with nothing on them. Plain! Ridiculous. I'm fed up with these fast food restaurants and they want you to pay $12 per person to eat and give you crap worth $2."}
{"text":"The manager at this location got in touch with me and apologized for this mishap. She then offered me a free medium two topping pizza for free the next time I order."}
{"text":"Literally never ever on time. The food is the same as any dominos pizza, the staff is polite, but the tracker always says it's been delivered and then my food shows up a half hour after that. If they were honest about their time, I know that dominos corporate would not be happy (because I worked at one) but I would be happier with a late delivery if I wasn't seeing that it was delivered a half hour before the driver even leaves the store."}
{"text":"Good taste, nice crust. Wait is never too long.  Pleasant delivery person. Only I think the one that almost ran into me the other day,  could drive a bit more careful. Our place of business is very near this pizza place so we order lunch monthly."}
{"text":"Okay so here's my story... My husband and I were visiting in Tempe and was hungry AF (excuse the abbreviated language)... So we decided to order Domino's since the Domino's here in Texas never seemed to disappoint, we decided what could go wrong... First choice was Spinelli's but they said delivery time was 2 hours so that's when we decided to go with Domino's.   We placed the order, and the pizza tracker on their website pulled up stating they were making it or whatever. Well, we waited and waited, and all of a sudden, the tracker quit working. So we waited, and we waited some more. Then we fell asleep... It was late, around 1 or 2 in the morning. The pizza never came. Thank God, I told my husband to choose the option to pay with cash rather than card on file because for some reason, I had this feeling something bad was gonna happen.  I'm going to give them at least 1 star because from our caller ID on our home phone here in Texas, it looks like they tried to call but of course we weren't home. They had our hotel info on file when we placed the order so I'm not sure why they didn't try to contact us there."}
{"text":"I used to order here often. Until today. I waited over an hour to call becaue my food never showed up. I called and talked to the rudest employee ever name Jacquline who pretty much yelled at me and said how they were doing the best they could, with one driver. I unserstand being short handed but the rudness is uncessary. Online the order said it would be 14 to 24 minutes for delivery it should definitely tell you if its going to be longer, or even the store. And even after I had called after the hour i had waited the order still hadnt even left. I will not be ordering from this location again they have lost my business. I cancelled my order and ordered Jimmy Johns and got my food in 10 mins."}
{"text":"Damn! I was worried when I was notified Frank was delivering my pie after all the shitty reviews about the guy. Delivery time said 24-35 minutes and it was here in 31. Pie was cooked perfectly (Hawaiian & everyone can eat a dick who says this isn't good). I live on a hard to find street in Arcadia and he had zero trouble finding it. Pie was so hot I had to let it cool for 5 minutes, granted it was Sunday night at 2230. 1 star taken away because he didn't offer parmesan or peppers."}
{"text":"Pizza was burnt and cold. It was not properly cut so I had to re cut it. The driver was also 20 minutes late. I would suggest to everyone not to order from here. I only live 10 minutes away walking distance so I don't understand why the delivery person took 20 minutes to get to my place driving."}
{"text":"We just tried to order a some things from here; we had 60 points so we could also get a free pizza, which we included in this order. They called us 5 minutes after we placed the order, saying somebody called out and that they already closed for the night because of it. Two hours before close? Okay. But they still charged my card, and we lost our free pizza points. If things aren't refunded in a few days, we're going to have to go right in to the store and demand a manager. I'm never ordering from here again. I've never seen a store more poorly run in the situation of a call out. If I could do zero stars, I would."}
{"text":"Not impressed, woooo hoooo I can track my order, Big deal. Went to pick up my pizza and nobody showed me anything. I can see why when I get out to the car and opened my box in my pizza was very dark. Poorly trained staff and low standards Produces the something in cooking."}
{"text":"I swung through here thinking it was still the \"old pizza place\" that lived in this location.  I was going to grab a couple of cheap pizzas to feed the kids and their friends.  There sat Domino's instead.  I didn't feel like driving to the \"other place's\" location, so I went in to see what I could get.  Prices were close enough, and I knew the pizza would be better.  Service was great - the manager behind the counter was very friendly and worked quickly.  A few other customers came in and got the same treatment.  I had to wait about 10 minutes to get my stuff, which wasn't bad (still quicker than driving to the other place).  Overall, the pizza was decent and the service was quick and friendly.  It's chain pizza, so you know what you're getting into.  If you want the oh-my-god-fantastic pizza from the Madison area, you know where to go.  If you need something quick to feed the family, this place will meet your needs.  The little parmesan bread nuggets were pretty excellent.  Much better than the \"breadsticks\" that looked dry and bland (though I didn't eat them).  Next time I'll remember they are there and use the internet or phone app to place my order so it's ready when I get there."}
{"text":"Ordered a large pizza at 10:30pm it's now past midnight and we still don't have pizza. Wooooow and Don't bother trying to call the about it either because they will stick you on hold forever then hang up on you multiple times. After many attempts at contacting the store we did receive pizza by 12:45am and weren't charged. Don't order from here."}
{"text":"I've ordered from this place at least once a week. The counterpersons always been nice. The pizza is always the same-very consistent. Could not ask for more."}
{"text":"Just when you thought that the city's most awful pizza could get any worse, I'm the first order of the day and it is late by 20 minutes.  Delivery guy phones to say he forgot his interac machine and that I will have pay cash or he'll be 30+ minutes late.  He arrives with no cash on hand for change. Now I have to tip someone 12 bucks for the pleasure of eating the city's most awful pizza, cold and late.  If this is your guilty pleasure, it's because you feel guilty for liking something so darn bad."}
{"text":"This was the first time I ordered take out from this Domino's. We had BBQ wings, which looked and tasted like they were made earlier in the day and reheated then BBQ sauce was poured on top. Thankfully they were still edible even though they stuck to the foil they were wrapped in. The pizza was nearly cold, but was okay. I thought they didn't put enough chicken and almost too much onion. Not sure that I will go back again."}
{"text":"3/4 times the pizza has been over an hour later than the time given. And cold. And noted in the \"pizza tracker\" as having left the shop over an hour previous. And the people in the shop couldn't care less-their response has always been \"it's on its way.\" Sometimes the drivers are nice, sometimes not-it depends. I'm not sure where the disconnect is here, but save yourself the trouble and just order carry out from a place you like instead of waiting over 2 hours for cold pizza."}
{"text":"We have ordered from this location for almost 5 years. They have always been friendly when we stop in to order, always busy and always appreciative . The delivery drivers are always very nice, clean and friendly. They hustle to get our food to use fresh and hot! I am glad they are close and keep on doing the great job !! Thanks Plaza Dominos !"}
{"text":"Domino's was a 2-hour delivery time,,, really! They just came out with a new coupon book. Will not be ordering any more. Will drive to Red Devil to get a pizza I enjoy even more"}
{"text":"After they took 1 hour for my order I'm extremely disappointed with my food. I didn't get the sauces that I paid for and the wings were so small."}
{"text":"Just ordered pizza for delivery, had a pepperoni mushrooms, and a Italian sausage green pepper, the order process went very good very nice woman helped me on the phone, they said it would take 30 to 35 minutes for delivery because it was Friday night. Great service the pizza was delivered to my front door in 20 minutes, very nice young man delivering, and both pizza's were very good"}
{"text":"I ordered tonight and it showed up very quickly. Alyssa (I think that was her name) the driver was very polite and everything was delicious!!"}
{"text":"Seriously, I am a huge fan of Dominos and their breadbowls! In every other place, I order pasta with alfredo sauce, chicken, bacon, and mushrooms. I ask for EXTRA on everything. Wanna know what I get? 5-6 pieces of chicken. Very little bacon. And dry pasta. In other dominos, I get what I ask for. and it is AMAZING. Not here. Now my next favorite thing HOT WINGS. They're so dam stingy here! My hot wings were regular wings with almost imaginary sauce. Wth! No sauce whatsoever. Where I used to live, their stuff was always great. I hate that this dominos doesn't deliver what I ask for. Makes me MAD. I have to drive elsewhere for my hot wings and pasta. Not cool, dominos. Not cool."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery for a thin crust pizza with the garlic parmesan pizza it was terrible! It was burnt at the edges and tasted like a hard cracker.  After emailing customer service as the \"guarantee satisfaction \" I received a generic email with a free medium pizza at the same location.  I had to call in to order and the person on the phone was extremely rude and gave me a difficult time trying to use it claiming that he wanted to charge me because I wanted a pan pizza and claimed that the sauce was a premium topping.   In the end he abruptly hung up on me and removed one of the toppings I wanted. Worst pizza ever !!"}
{"text":"I've always loved Domino's and this one is no exception until last night. I went to order a pizza and knew that they had stopped delivering to my area so asked if I could do carry-out. Carry-out closes right before I called so I asked I'd I could have a delivery to their parking lot (semi joking) and they said no. Then when I said \"So, there is no way I can buy a pizza from you guys?\" he responded with \"No. You should try Barro's or Papa John's\"...  I understand the place being closed and all but his rude, short attitude along with the fact that he didn't even recommend another local Domino's and instead referred me to another company for pizza was absurd. If I was the manager, I'd fire that kid on the spot."}
{"text":"I was so happy too find a Domino's that delivered to me here in Pittsburgh. I always loved Domino's when I lived in New York and would get is every week or two. I ordered 2 medium pizzas with black olives and pepparoni and extra sauce. The pizza was exactly the same as in New York which made me very happy as I love Domino's. The delivery service was good and the pizza arrived hot.  I will definitely be ordering again as I really like Domino's. I also like the convenience of the home delivery and it being hot."}
{"text":"The pie (thin crust, works or whatever they call it) was damned good. We ordered delivery using the $5.99 deal (2 items for 6 bucks each). Service was fast. There was a snafu with the restaurant providing our driver with a CC receipt, but we signed the delivery receipt and were told it will all work out in the end. Like I saidm the pizza was good, crispy BUT uncut. Luckily, we have a nice pizza cutter, so no prob except that the pie got a bit cold while we figured out it wasn't cut and rectified the problem. The sad note is that there's no way the garden salad is worth 6 bucks. Yeah, it has a fancy container and all but you could buy this in a bag at winco for like $1.99, maybe $2.50 since they do include croutons. Get the pizza, skip the salad is my advice."}
{"text":"This is the worst, we will never order from dominoes again!  I'm still on hold now 25 minutes, we have two phones on hold for dominos and on one phone they picked up the phone and didn't answer.  We have a dominos account and it wouldn't let us sign on.  Now they are saying we will be right with you.  We sat on hold forever and your employees just pick up the phone and let it sit.  We could here them.  Ridiculous!"}
{"text":"Between their new flavorful crust and the Monday - Wednesday large pizza special, it's a good pizza for a great price (about $8.50 w/ 3 toppings). For carry out, they're fast (about 10 to 15 minutes) too."}
{"text":"Poor customer service.   My pizza never showed. When I called, I was schooled on their policy of calling to confirm orders like I was an idiot for not knowing.  Then they made it sound like it wounded bed a major effort to remake there pizza.  No problem.  Keeo it."}
{"text":"Gave me a free drink. Too many people calling, so i had to wait longer than 15 minutes.  Thank you for free drink. I had to clock back in at 1:45pm late clock in. A free drink won't do it. They need 4 people. Never leave one employee working alone in a pizza place."}
{"text":"Ordered a pizza to go via the app.....they got everything right, but I did have to wait an extra 5 minutes.  And they definitely were not busy?  As far as the pizza goes, it was your standard Domino's Pizza.....nothing great, but not bad.  Pizza is expensive for what you get!  If it wasn't for the need to feed some hungry boys at a birthday party, I would have checked out some alternatives in the area (Stella's in New Ken)!!"}
{"text":"I ordered two pizza's online went down 15 minutes later and picked them up. Servers were very courteous and friendly. Great job all around!"}
{"text":"The food was ok I had a chicken parmesan sandwich my daughter had chicken Alfredo were good but the lava cake was over cooked and tasted burnt.. Corporate email me the next day and took care of my issue thank you.."}
{"text":"Never get your order right and when you call to let them know they act like they care but they really dont. All workers look like they hate there job"}
{"text":"Order is correct, service is fast, and they have gluten free! Wish they had deals for small pizzas or gluten free was offered in medium or large."}
{"text":"No Round Table Pizza in AZ!!!  I was a big fun and I still miss their pizza a lot.  Domino is okay but not enough toppings and sometimes they forget to put on 1 or 2 toppings.   I only buy on Tuesday,  buy one large pizza get one free.  It's a deal."}
{"text":"WARNING!! The manager whomever this female is she did not say her name when answering the phone was very rude and disrespectful. She explained their policy to me and I said \"thanks hun I appreciate it\" before I could finish she hung up on me. Yes I called back and she again was rude AF and called me a bitch. I'm sorry it's not my fault all she can do with her life is work at Domino's if she doesn't know how to communicate respectfully maybe she should not be in customer service. I hope upper management/corporate sees this and she is talked to because her attitude sucks. Apparently her name is Terra or however you spell it. DO NOT ORDER FROM HERE!!"}
{"text":"Ordered a breadbowl pasta with marinara/cheese/pepperoni/beef and a medium thin crust half pepperoni/half cheese pizza. I watched on the pizza tracker when it was ready but it took awhile before it went out for delivery, so by the time it arrived, it wasn't hot anymore. But it all reheated well for leftovers."}
{"text":"I was dropping off a prescription at the nearby Walgreens drive-thru and looked over and saw Domino's. Sounded like a good choice for dinner so my other half placed our order on his phone. I wanted the Breadbowl Pasta with pepperoni, shredded provolone, and shredded parmesan. When the Pizza Tracker said it was ready, we went inside to eat since they have tables and I had to wait for my prescription. The guy said it would be 5 more minutes because they had to remake my b/f's sandwich (I guess they burned it or something?). We sat and ate our other food in the meantime. The Breadbowl Pasta hit the spot. The BBQ Bacon Chicken is yummy too. And the tables were very clean since people don't normally dine in. :)"}
{"text":"Ordered from the app which was easy to begin with. Followed how quickly everything was being done with the tracker and was pleasantly surprised. The delivery driver, Sabrina, was great--very polite and professional!"}
{"text":"We ordered some pizza and cheese bread over an hour ago and it never showed up (with a quoted time of 45 to 50 mins) so we called them to see what's up. They told us that \"we weren't sure you wanted to wait the quoted time, so we cancelled your order\"... Umm, we were aware of the quoted time since we ordered online and it told us this... So we went with a better option. This is not how you conduct business. SMDH."}
{"text":"Domino's just recently popped up on my radar within the last year or so. One day I got a Domino's gift card (random) and POOF! I was hooked. According to my husband, Domino's has made a real comeback. I don't know what \"old\" Domino's tasted like, so I can't attest to their so-called new debut. One thing I do know - Domino's pizza is tasty. And cheap. Wait that's two things. Ah well you catch my drift! The crust is flavorful and the cheese tastes REAL. The ingredients used are always super fresh. Yummy for my tummy!   When you place an order online, you can track your order's progress in real time. Example: Andrew just put your pizza in the oven at 5:36PM. That's pretty cool.   I've never had an order mix-up or any kind of problem at the Aliante location. Ordering and picking up is as easy as 1-2-3. Whenever I want a cheap pizza night, Domino's is my go-to.  YELP 100 CHALLENGE 2015: #07"}
{"text":"no star... order delivery.. ham mushrooms thin crust. and thick crust pepperoni.. thin crust and was uncooked so soggy... the deep dish the same.... manager must have turned the oven off trying to close early .. under cooking everything.. I paid cash.. I want my money back. I have pics of it all in the trash.."}
{"text":"When you're drunk AF looking for a fix waiting for 3 pizzas for a hour and 42 min then the operator says I'll send you to the manager .... And manager will maybe compensated you and you don't. Call this place. Cold and slow pizza. I said to go to Pizza Hut. This place is a fail."}
{"text":"Waited 30 minutes for my so called complete pizza. They also allowed tourists to drink in the store."}
{"text":"worst pizza I've ever had .  Extremely saucy and the sauce tasted like ketchup.   I've never had this Brand before and I'm sure I don't have it again"}
{"text":"This pizza is awful.  It tastes like cardboard (like the other review states) and it's just very generic - salty and processed.  Don't even bother.  It's not improved at all - contrary to the commercials."}
{"text":"The specialty buffalo chicken was awesome.  The only problem is the young man on the phone needs further training.  I was ordering the specialty buffalo chicken and he didn't have a clue what I was talking about. Finally had to get someone else on the phone and it was done in 30 seconds.  In the young mans defense he was new but they should know better to put someone on the phone that's not ready.  All in all food was great and that's the bottomline."}
{"text":"I've ordered delivery from this location for 7 years. They're always so fast on deliveries. I love the app for smart phones. You can track your order from beginning to your door step. Price and quality are on par for delivery pizza. Their chicken alfredo pasta is awesome! I just wish it was a little bigger portion. I really miss their artisan pizza those were the bomb. Please bring them back. Drivers are always friendly. I will continue to order from them. Thanks for the great service over the years!"}
{"text":"HORRIBLE HORRIBLE DOMINOS. Completely screwed up my order because of their online serviced changed things to things I didn't want, and then when I called to complain they said it was completely my fault, even though I ordered the food how I wanted it. Now they basically stole 50 dollars for me, and refuse to even say sorry or give me 7 dollars back just for the pasta THEY screwed up. I refuse to order from them EVER AGAIN. And I hope other people won't as well. They don't deserve the business."}
{"text":"Dominoes Pizza... we've each other for a long time. Sometimes things weren't so great, but often times things were fantastic. We've spent long periods of time together, and then there's days where we don't go a second without seeing each other. Sometimes, you do see other people and that's okay. I know whenever I need you, you'll be there. You're not perfect, and neither am I. That's what makes us perfect for each other.  I'm getting older, Dominoes. I need some stability in my life. You're my rock, my crutch. You're the only one I ever want. Sure, Pizza Hut said they'd be there for me, but who always rushed to my door when I needed something quick. It was you. No one's ever done that as well as you.  You're smart, sweet, caring, and delicious. Those other pizza stores never mattered to me - you were my main goal. I love you Dominos Pizza."}
{"text":"Outstanding customer service! The manager is more than willing to work with the customers above and beyond the call of duty, not in regards to his title of management but in accordance to helping the customer be completely satisfied with their experience at this place of business. Whenever i order dominos I will never think twice about choosing this location to order pizza as a Dominos Corporation! Thank you team dominos #Success #ManagementControl."}
{"text":"Oh dominoes, you used to be the pizza I go to when I felt like pizza. But now your pan pizza is way too oily -ugh! Changed chef maybe? Anyways we decided to check out Dominoes again after a long while of not coming back. They were having a 50% deal for the Black Friday week sooo we ordered the Philly Steak Pizza. Tasted alright. The regular crust tasted so bleh. Too plain.   The next pizza we had was a customized crunchy thin crust with Italian sausage, Brooklyn Pepperoni, Onions, Ground Beef, aand extra cheese. That was good but they cut our pizza into weird square pieces instead of the regular pizza slices. Hm, weird!"}
{"text":"After a not so pleasant expirencs there manager called me and offer me a credit to make up for it. I came in every one was extremely nice and the pizza was really good. Thank you for the great customer services will be back."}
{"text":"My go to dominoes in my area.  I live maybe a 3 minute walk away.. Sometimes when its too cold I order delivery and it takes an hour....  But the pizza is good most of the time. It's pretty consistent. However, if you have like a 50% off promotion, they skimp on the toppings. It's disappointing.  Note: you can't go in and buy a single slice, you can only get a whole pizza."}
{"text":"I don't get the one star ratings this place has gotten. We have ordered pizza and wings over 10 times and it's always been fine. Tonight I got there and was informed that they made my pizza and it had a huge bubble so the cheese wasn't uniform and they were remaking it. That is good service, not letting me get out the door and home with an inferior pizza. Darren is the one who checked and made the call, give him a raise."}
{"text":"Ordered on the app. App told me it was ready. I come in and they have no idea where my pizza is, so they have to remake it. As I'm waiting they tell every other person that walks in that their order isn't ready. A lady had the same thing where the app said it was ready and it wasn't. They find the pizza and say \"sorry we didn't see it.\" The girl making her pizzas is talking on the phone. Not sure how that is sanitary. They offered me a free dessert which was nice. And the girl on the phone tells the employee that offered me the dessert \"you better make sure you inventory that.\" Oh and the delivery guy walks out with his delivery bag eating a piece of pizza, loads his car, and comes back for another slice of pizza. That's probably where my pizza went. I will never eat here again."}
{"text":"I don't normally review major fast food chains because I'm pretty sure people who frequent these places don't know what Yelp is and people who read Yelp reviews have enough self-respect to avoid establishments such as Domino's.   Alas, I have made it my mission to tell everybody I know to avoid this Dominos. I waited over 3 hours for a pizza which is absolutely unacceptable. The reason I didn't give up after 1.5 hours is that I was strung along by manager who kept promising that the pizza would come \"in 15 minutes\" when I called every 20 minutes after the 90 minute mark. It is understandable that delivery can be slow if there aren't enough drivers, however it is completely unacceptable to mislead customers the way the manager did. I felt incredibly disrespected and was appalled that a manager would be so open about lying to my face. It was also extremely embarassing because I had guests over who were excited for late night pizza in Pittsburgh.   I guess when customers can't respect themselves enough to avoid eating at Dominos at 1AM, we shouldn't expect Domino's to either.    In sum, I am disgusted by the people who work here and will never come back."}
{"text":"This Domino's makes great food! I used to work at Domino's and the carbonara alfredo bowls here are just so good! Today I'm being good and getting a salad.. but yum.. I love Domino's! Also, they have a chalk wall with super awesome chalk drawings!"}
{"text":"This is the closest location to home so we often order from here. When i say often, I mean once a week for our family movie night. We always do carry out. It's so close that it's better than paying for delivery and possibly getting cold pizza. We never have an issue with our order but I can say that staff is not the greatest. You walk in and you won't be acknowledged. An assembly line of 10+ workers and delivery drivers in and out and not 1 person acknowledges you. You have to waive them down to get someone to help. I only had one issue with an order and called and they gave me credit for my order.  Only giving 3 star for the pizza but if i can give no stars for service, I would."}
{"text":"I placed my order on line. I go and pick up my order and pay. Then only half my order is done. That is so wrong in my book so I asked for my money back. If you place a order and says it's don't and it not what the  Hell"}
{"text":"I order from this store quit often. The order is missing something about every time. If I call to ask about it,all I get is a \"sorry\". I mean, I am paying for this stuff, regardless of the amount, and all they say is sorry? I think a blind squirrel could manage that location better."}
{"text":"Horrible.  $24 for two burnt, but delivered pizzas.  Kinda like getting screwed in the drive-thru."}
{"text":"Honestly, I used to HATE Dominos. Their pizza used to be complete and utter crap. Then they went through that little revamping stage (you remember the commercials) and good lord, they've turned themselves around. The pizza is not my favorite delivery pizza in the valley.   They've begun using good quality ingredients, and my favorite part; the crust is brushed wityh butter and has garlic and spices sprinkled over. I adore Dominos now, they've won me over after a long hiatus of hating them by finally producing a superb pizza."}
{"text":"Order #4 online and i wish there was a \"cook well done\" option. Other than that its great to do/use 2-3 times a month"}
{"text":"I placed an order recently with this location. I wanted cheap pizza and hadn't tried Domino's in years so decided to give it a try. I think that I avoided them for years because the food sucks and I must have pushed that bad memory away. I ordered a pizza, classic buffalo hot wings, and a philly cheesesteak sandwich. Placing the order online is simple, though many pizza places now offer this.   The food wood delivered quickly and the driver was polite. The food was terrible. The pizza had no flavor. The wings I received looked like chicken nuggets with gross mush piled on top. I think I may have mad a mistake on reading the description properly on them. Honesty the worst excuse for \"chicken wings\" I have ever tried in my entire life. The philly cheese steak was mostly bread and barely had any meat at all.   I recall years ago Domino's came out with a marketing campaign admitting that their pizza was ranked one of the worst pizza chains voted by consumers. So they recreated their menu to try to bring customers back. I think they may need to try again."}
{"text":"I ordered online using a coupon without a problem. Online pizza tracking was accurate (it tells you when the pizza is baking to ready to be picked up). The single pizza was ready within 15 minutes. I paid in store without a hitch. The service was courteous and efficient. The pizza was delicious as always. It's my go-to Domino's in my local area."}
{"text":"I ordered a 3 topping pizza 11/15/2017 on the three topping for $7.99 deal. It was for pickup. My son picked it up but didn't look at it before he brought it home. When he got home I noticed that a topping was missing. When I called to report it, I was told they could make me another pizza or get a free pizza the next time we ordered. When I called tonight, the person answering the phone told me that the clerk reported or us to have two bread sticks or $2 of the pizza. I was very upset and told him he just lost a customer. He acted like he could care less. Well we will never order a pizza from them again."}
{"text":"Gluten-free Crust If you're looking for a gluten-free pizza option, definitely give Dominos a try! We were pleasantly surprised with the crispy crust. It had a nice flavor and did not get soggy or mushy after a minutes on the table.   Toppings We ordered the first sauce on the list which was \"robust\" something. It was spicy in a weird way. We didn't like it. Also, I ordered spinach and olives. Although I saw a typical amount of olives, the spinach was scarce.  Note: This location does NOT deliver to Squirrel Hill. However, order and pickup were easy. We used the Dominos app, and we got exactly what we ordered, and it was ready in 10-15 minutes. Another great benefit of the app is the wide selection of coupon codes. There's literally a section of the app that is just a list of all the specials going on. Whoo hoo!"}
{"text":"Wow. What a horrible place. This was the 3rd time I ordered from this location and I never want to waste money on Domino's again. First time I ever ordered, no issues. 2nd time, I got attitude from the driver. This time, I put an order in and after 90 minutes I called to cancel it. When I called, someone very rudely answered the phone; never said his name. I asked to cancel the order and he said fine. I asked him to confirm the order; he replied he has it up in the screen. I told him to confirm the name and I got attitude. Absolutely ridiculous. No apologizes or explanations. Just an outright jerk right from the start. Disgusting way to run a business."}
{"text":"Food is alright but my last order arrived an hour after the app said it was on its way. Almost ordered today, but didn't want to gamble on a wait."}
{"text":"If I could give this place a 0 I would.. We have had countless problems with this location. We got a free pizza through the app and when my bf went to pick it up they tried to make him pay for it. Then when we tried it again they tried to give us the same pizza that was sitting there for half an hour. I contacted head office and got a coupon for a free pizza which I gave away to a friend because there is no way I will ever eat from here again! The people that work here are rude and the lady at the cash seems like she has no clue what's going on.. DO NOT EAT FROM THIS LOCATION!"}
{"text":"Meant to make pizza last night but my dough didn't rise in time so decided to order one instead and this was the only place I could find that was open. Put in an online order for a couple pizzas and cheesy bread. It arrived pretty quick which was nice, but the only thing that wasn't awful was the cheesy bread. The pizzas were both extremely thin, greasy and worse than a $5 frozen pizza. Lesson learned."}
{"text":"Love the addition of the fresh salads available in the online ordering. The web site has gone through some changes and its nice and easy to use. Appreciate the drivers calling when their GPS's send them to the wrong street! =) Love our Domino's!"}
{"text":"So frustrated right now.  Just trying to use my rewards for my gluten free pizza using the code you guys gave me gfcrust and I get an error EVERY TIME.  I wrote you guys a few days ago on Facebook no response. I emailed you, no response.  I just called the store that I order from and was told \"we don't control the internet\". When I asked to speak with a manager I was put on hold and the same girl came back on and said \"we don't control the internet I asked my manager and that's what she said too\". She refused to let me speak with the manager all I wanted was a phone number for help with my online order.  Girl I spoke with was Kayla, said her manager is Marissa.  I can promise I will never do business with you guys again this is super terrible how you treat your customers."}
{"text":"How do you run out of pineapple? How do you wait 20 minutes to contact us and tell us you have no pineapple when your 'tracker' told us it was in the oven. And to top it off you offer nothing in return for wasting my time? Point taken! Give me my refund. And how about you go find some pineapple!"}
{"text":"The pizzas are good and the service is awesome I think people get the wrong ideas when walking into restaurants like this, it's not a fast food place your food is being made in front of you quickly and professionally. Hygiene isn't a concern because all of the precooked food goes through an oven and the workers wash their hands constantly. I see the pizza makers toss the dough and make the food with lightning speed and they're only getting paid minimum wage."}
{"text":"Meh. After waiting 75 minutes for our pizza delivery on a weeknight, we were completely underwhelmed. Our pizza and breadsticks were lukewarm and tasted like they had been sitting under a warmer all day. There was a severe lack of cheese on the pizza and the dough itself was also very bland. They skimp on the toppings too! Do yourself a favor and order from Papa Johns instead."}
{"text":"Same experience as others. Horrible customer service and the pizza and garlic twists were barely lukewarm, as well as missing my dipping sauces I had ordered. Delivery time was long, but I could get over that considering the weather wasn't great. The guy I spoke to on the phone pretty much insinuated I was lying about when I received my food and told me if my food was cold, not lukewarm, that's a big difference because cold would be like a dead body?!? Huh?? Extremely rude and hung up on me when I asked what his name was. The call was placed on January 29th at approximately 10:55 pm, an hour and a half after placing my order. I'm sure nothing will happen but horrible representations like this are why I'd rather spend the extra money for the extra service. Wish I could give it zero stars..."}
{"text":"I've been waiting almost two hours for my one, medium pizza to arrive.  I placed my order online at 5:00pm and was quoted with a 25-35 minute wait time. It's 6:35pm and I'm still waiting.   No pizza is worth a two-hour wait (unless it's Lou Malnati's in Chicago).   Helllloooo, Pizza Hut!"}
{"text":"Order delivery a few times a month. The pizza and wings are always hot and tasty (hunger is the best ingredient).  Delivery drivers are usually quick & friendly. They have made mistakes & forgot sauces that were paid for to accompany items I have ordered on more than one occasion. I finally decided to call and complain after the 4th (possibly 5th) time and the manager was very responsive and handled the situation to my satisfaction. We haven't had any issues since."}
{"text":"I'm not giving this place five stars because of the food.  This is Dominos and it is what it is.  But when every other place in Boulder City shuts down at 8:00 (which blows my mind) sometimes you're stuck with Dominos.  And as far as Dominos goes, this is the best one I've ever dealt with.  Tonight I ordered and my standard Dominos fare was delivered in under 20 minutes from order submission to ingesting the food I immediately regretted...as I would any pizza.    Delivery kid was super nice.  I had some coupon.  You're nuts to order from any of these places without a coupon."}
{"text":"Nice customer service and they're really quick. I walked in and asked for any specials and they actually got a Mgr special that night, 2 large pizzas w/ 2 toppings for $5.99 each sounds like a great deal for me. Thanks!"}
{"text":"Literally the best customer service! The person at the cashier was so friendly and just great energy! Literally best experience getting and waiting for pizza"}
{"text":"There is something wrong with this Dominos location. Sometimes they don't answer the phone at all that even the other dominoes close by told me that they hear that from customers a lot. I ordered their gluten free pizza and the guy on the phone just said thank you and was about to hang up. I asked him if he knew where he was going to send it and he then confirmed the address but did not tell me my order back to me. It wasn't gluten free when it was delivered and when I called they would not answer the phone. This place is awful."}
{"text":"Honestly ordering generic pizza should come quickly and without Hastle, however, not the case. Consistently 30 mins late for delivery orders. Overpriced despite membership. Employees do not speak English. Have ordered 5+ times because they are the only place to deliver to squirrel hill. Once did not receive pizza because they did not ring doorbell to house, even gave description in online order. Overall THE WORST service, pizza, etc ever I would LITERALLY order from ANYWHERE  if they would deliver"}
{"text":"One orders Domino's pizza usually out of necessity, not of desire. It's not the worst pizza out there, but no where close to the best.   I placed a small order for delivery, a medium pizza with two toppings, at 12:38PM and the estimated delivery time was 20-30 minutes.    When the estimated maximum delivery time has exceeded a half hour, I call to inquire about the order.  I am told that the driver is out on my delivery, but going the other way first for another order.    Fifteen minutes pass and I see the driver pull into a neighbor's driveway deliver my pizza to their door.  They decline delivery and she dawdles in front of their home to make a call.    I know if I receive a pizza now it will be barely warm.  So much for a piping hot, fresh pizza on a cold afternoon.  I call the franchise to cancel the order and see about a refund on my credit card payment.  The man who answered the phone is non-apologetic and doesn't have much to say at all about the abysmal service.  I ask if I can speak to the manager; he says he is the manager.  He says he will cancel the order.  I say, \"What about my refund?\" he says, \"There's no refund, you haven't paid.\"  Somewhat speechless about the level of customer service, I asked about a refund because I had already paid for the order.  He insists several times I didn't pay online; I tell him I did.  Finally he says, \"Oh, I see it.\"  No apologies, he only says I'll have to trust that he issues a refund.    AVOID THIS DOMINO'S PIZZA."}
{"text":"I had delivery from here this past weekend. Ordered online, delivery was super fast! Pizzas tasted great, however one slice had absolutely no cheese or toppings on it lol, not sure how that happened. Anyway it tasted good and got here fast so we were pretty happy. 2 medium pizzas + $2.50 delivery charge + tip came to $20."}
{"text":"Giving 2 stars because we are unable to order online. We are 3.8 miles and unable to order online. This has caused us to order from Pizza Hut more often."}
{"text":"Buyer beware!  I order pizzas and I have had a coupon for a discount and they over charged me on three different orders....  I like the Brooklyn Crust and I order it every time and one time I ordered five pizzas and four had the Brooklyn Crust and one didn't and driver tried to explain it was, it didn't even look remotely close to the other pizzas......  I would stay away!  Take home frozen pizza is most likely better then this Domino's Store....."}
{"text":"We order from this Domino's twice a month and they are by for the best Domino's store in the valley.  The always give credit for our coupon and discounts and pizza is always hot and on time.....  The store manager has always followed through and the pizza always arrives on time.  When they say 30 minuts or less they mean it!"}
{"text":"The pizza was hot, the order was correct, I ordered the pizza to be delivered at a set time and it was on time and most important, it was fresh, cooked just right and it tasted great!  Best Dominos in the Southern Nevada area!"}
{"text":"The rudest person answered the phone he was  mean, acted like I was bothering him, he was short, raised his voice, and had few smart remarks.   After five minutes of outing up with moron, I hung up on him!  He was insulting and was wrong person to have working the phone.   We got pizza from another pizza shop!"}
{"text":"I stop by this Dominos store and ordered pizzas for the local Boys & Girls Clubs and this store gave a great price, they were so helpful and manager was a real stand up guy.....  He throw in a couple extra pizzas for the kids and they were delivered on time with no delay..  It's business like this store that have made a strong commitment to improving our community!  The leader among all Domino Stores!  Please support this store, these people really care!"}
{"text":"Pizza confirmed ordered at 620.  Showed Order cooked at 630.  Driver shows up 725, forget sauce which has happened the last three times even tho I put a reminder note on the order, and had the gull to say \"hot and ready\". No surprise it tasted like it had come out of the oven 55 minutes prior."}
{"text":"We ordered pizza and wings for delivery and it showed up nice and hot! So delicious! Fast delivery and I love that you're able to see where your order is at in the process!"}
{"text":"Disappointed we can't order online we live 2.4 miles away and my wife just did 2 weeks ago.  Maybe less time and money with commercials and more time on customer service!"}
{"text":"I used the online order system from my hotel room.  Once the order was completed (and paid via cc) I received an email stated delivery would be 33 - 46 minutes.  At about 50 minutes after the order had been placed (I was going by the time stamp on the email) I called the store.  The employee that answered said they were telling everyone that orders would be 1 - 1.5 hours delivery time.  When I mentioned that the email said 33 - 46 minutes she said they had no control over what is stated via on line ordering.  I made a second call at over 90 minutes past the time the order had been placed.  I was told the delivery person had to made two trips and should be there soon. I was offered a credit or a future order, which I told the person wouldn't be of benefit to me since I am in a hotel room.  About that time the delivery person arrived.  My food was lukewarm.  Pasta dish had cooled and pasta was all clumped together.  Boneless chicken also warm at best.  Terrible experience."}
{"text":"I ordered pizza from here online for delivery. Online it said the pizza would be delivered in 60-75 minutes.  60 minutes later I received a call from Dominos stating our order would be delivered even later and they expected 1.5 to 2.5 hours later.  Which would have gotten our pizza to us maybe by 11 if it came in 2 hours. I was starving when I placed the order and needless to say I wasn't going to wait another 2 hours. The person that called didn't even say she was sorry!! This place is a joke. Your better off making a frozen pizza at home, at least you would get it. Now I just hope they don't charge me for it."}
{"text":"I got my breadsticks literally they were just bread! I wanted to use a coupon I had (8 breadstick for a dollar) and they denied it, thats what I should have paid for for what I got. Not to forget the fact that there seems to never ever be a manager there to speak with. Pizza lacked the extra toppings that were requested.  Do NOT give these ppl your business"}
{"text":"Love dominos pizza! First time i ever had a delivery and the girl named Sarah was super sweet! Definitely will be hearing from me again!"}
{"text":"Picked up 2 pizzas absolutely no cheese pure sauce.. Called in to see if I could have them replaced no offer and manager was argumentative and hung up on me I was calling back to get the corp # he kept hanging up on me. We ate what we could we don't like wasting money... CALLED JOHN THE DISTRICT MANAGER- he corrected the problem and even offered 20dllr gift card he went out of his way to treat me with respect.   UPDATE 5/4/16  pleased with the outcome the district manager cleared this problem up with the disrespect I got from last visit. My family and I really appreciate going above and beyond for us. Used my credit of 20 dollars and the pizzas were perfect. I have changed to 5 star from 1 star for the overly kind customer service from John."}
{"text":"7:40 on a Friday night and they aren't taking orders for delivery, because they are two hours behind. It wouldn't be too bad, but minus Fuel, they are the only other pizza place that delivers in NoDa."}
{"text":"Manager was rude a female manager to be specific she don't give a name but was very rude and did not send me proper condiments."}
{"text":"BAD EXPERIENCED EVERRRR!!! never in my life have complained to any businesses but this Domino's Pizza have the bad service and take forever to have the order ready! took me about  1 hour and 45 minutes (or more) to have my order ready! and gave me attitude!!! what kind of service is thissss????? WOULD never come back here again! ever.   it deserve 0 star but no choice! anyhowwww, the foods are fine though. if you ever consider ordering pizza from this place. just call in and come pick up in 2 hours! many people were complaining and cancelled orders!!"}
{"text":"OK, so it's been almost an hour since I ordered, the  tracker feature isn't working, I called the store to see where my order was and was told \"we are busy, it should be there in 15 minutes, there is nothing we can do\" very very rude customer service no apologies nothing."}
{"text":"DO NOT ORDER FROM THIS LOCATION!! I just had delivered what I thought was chicken Alfredo and a philly cheese steak sandwich. I opened the pasta which was nearly empty, over cooked and tini bits of chicken. The sandwich was was soggy, greasy and I cannot describe what it tasted like. Definitly not a philly cheese sandwich! I immediately called, Dasia answered.Said she asked manager Jesse. Claims Jesse said he made my meal and it was correct , and would not do anything for me. I said I'd love to send a pic. She continued to argue. She said she could make a new one with no guarantees as to when it could be delivered. I asked for the top manager . She would not divulge the name. I insisted in at least a credit in the pasta due to the lack thereof and disgrace. I have ordered this plenty from another location, I knew what to expect. Shame on these 2 for the lack of customer service and zero skills!"}
{"text":"This is literally the WORST domino's I have ever had to deal with. My household orders dominos once a week and since we moved close to this location (and are not allowed delivery from any other) the food is always INCORRECT! I seriously do not remember getting an order without an issue since I moved here 2 years ago. That would be 104 WRONG ORDERS!  - No sauce that we were charged extra for - Burnt Items - 2 HOUR delivery times (not exaggerating) - Mango Habanero Sandwich with no Mango Habanero Sauce? - Completely wrong ingredients on pizza (like not even close)  At first I would call and complain, but now its gotten to the point where I just expect the order to be wrong and hope it's at least close to what I want."}
{"text":"The pizza taste was fine, order two pizza's and both pizza were cut funky! Huge slices or mini slice that fits in the palm of your hands. I guess the cook never learned fractions!!!"}
{"text":"I've been ordering from here from a while and have to say they have really stepped up their game after the remodel. They always quote 30-35 min but its almost always delivered in 15-20 minutes. I ordered the other night and I can't believe I never knew they had sandwiches but i ordered a  philly cheese steak with extra steak(which turned out to be a ton) and it was incredible. I agree with A. U. if you become a regular it's probably not the best idea to stiff the driver, I wouldn't want my philly cold haha.  Great service Dominos!"}
{"text":"The service was great, we ordered on the phone & had trouble finding our M&G but they didn't get upset on the wait . Overall , the wings came here in 15 minutes with no time to spare & tasted delicious . Recommend this place for ASU students who get hungry at night & want something quick to come there way (-:"}
{"text":"My boyfriend is a dominos fan. They've been his pizza place of choice for years. However this location has swayed him. They have messed up our pizza the last few times. Once he called and asked if they were still taking orders for delivery or if it was too late (about an hour and a half before closing) she said they were still taking orders. He ordered then she said the credit card machine was down and they couldn't place the order. She didn't even ask if we wanted to pay cash. The manager called the next day to apologize for her and told us that the machine wasn't down. They gave us a free pizza to use for next time. The next time we ordered the delivery person was 15 minutes late and the order was wrong. I don't expect a lot from dominoes but there are much better pizza options in the area."}
{"text":"I have given the employees at this location the benefit of the doubt numerous times. However the same exact problems continue to occur each time. The pizza tracker is never right, the delivery time takes 65-90 minutes to reach my location, they always mess up something on my order, and my pizza is always cold when it arrives. The drivers appear lethargic most of the time and never seem fazed for being late or forgetting something on my order. I would give this place zero stars if I could.   The last time I ordered from them they made the wrong pizza, took two hours to deliver it, and the driver did not care at all. I gave this place a chance for a full year but they have completely lost my business.   Save yourself the hassle and order somewhere else."}
{"text":"You get what you pay for! Their $5.99 deal produces such a low quality product! We won't be ordering again.  Our pizzas came cold and all messy. Lesson learned...stick with Pizza Hut."}
{"text":"Since moving here four years ago I have tried many local, highly regarded pizzas and been less than impressed.  Since my two all time favorite pizzas, Guidos and Donatos are not in the valley, I have had to look elsewhere.  For me, you cannot beat the taste and value of a Dominos pizza, when ordered correctly. I particularly like their three topping carryout special for $7.99.  The key for me is to start with crunchy thin crust and extra hearty marinara sauce(delete the robust inspired pizza sauce), for which you incur no additional charges.  To that I add pepperoni, extra pepperoni  and extra cheese, the closest to Donatos out here! Another killer pizza is made with crunchy thin crust, extra alfredo sauce, chicken, spinach and black olives, yum.  Dominos phone app is easy to use and the pizza is always done on time. Try it; you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Domino's Streetsboro easy on line or call in ordering quick  reasonably priced and good pizza and sides.  Delivery people are kind and courteous as are the employees at the Streetsboro location  I highly recommend them"}
{"text":"Tried the new and improved Domino's pizza. Is it better...yes. Does it beat many of the other local places...no.  They do have a pricing difference and coupons all over the place. I'd rather pay more and enjoy it more."}
{"text":"this location is awesome. i always have perfect food and service not to mention, i asked for stewie griffin to be drawn on the box.. and it was perfect... ****do not waste your time with the pizza hut in the same parking lot. i was a loyal customer to them even after they had me wait 2 hours for a pizza delivery.****   #teamdominos"}
{"text":"I rather enjoy this Dominos. All of the staff I have ever encountered are super nice and surprisingly helpful by suggesting cheap combos to make my order cheaper. No eye rolling happens here when I sub marinara sauce for ranch and their service is always super quick.  honest their pizza is not the best but their add-ons rock my socks off! I usually get cravings for the delicious garlic cheesy bread or buffalo kickers after work, and will often pop-by for a late night pickup. To be"}
{"text":"Don't use this dominos. They are charging 1.35 for Parmesan cheese. And they claim to have no napkins. Please note that I was not asking for extra. I was asking for 1. The white guy that left as I was walking didn't seem to have a problem"}
{"text":"Ordered a pizza. Was told 45 minute delivery time. After an hour and a half I called to cancel order. Driver shows up two hours later attempting to deliver pizza. We had already eaten somewhere else. Charged my credit card anyway. Horrible."}
{"text":"My bf and I both worked at dominos for years and the service here sucks. Obviously the food wasn't taken care of it took almost an hour then they put us on hold for 15 min then when it disconnected the driver called me to tell me he was on his way but still canceled my order while I was on the phone with him. I know things get busy but a call ahead of would have been nice before my guests went to get other food. Sorry not sorry."}
{"text":"Great service and food!  A good way to start our weekend.  The drivers are SO nice and the food was piping hot like right out of the oven.  Thanks for the excellent service!"}
{"text":"I'm really disappointed. My husband and I just moved here from Utah and we had a Dominos close by that was awesome!! The service was always great and so was the pizza.   Today was had the opposite! First of all this dominos is the closest to us, but is still a 15 minute drive. I ordered the pizza online but had my husband go pick it up. When he got there he was hassled because the name on the order was mine, even though we have the same last name and address. The girl had to get her manager to get permission to give my husband the already paid for pizza. What in the world?!  Second, when we opened the pizza we were disappointed. The crust had waaay less seasoning than our previous dominos. And it felt like the pizza needed to be cooked longer. One more thing...it was horribly cut! I'm so bugged!  The one positive is that I can still order online and use the dominos tracker.   Needless to say, I had to come on Yelp to review this place to vent some frustrations. I'm sad bc we loved out old Dominos, but we won't be retiring to this location."}
{"text":"Don't you just love the smell of new things,  especially if it smells like pizza?!?!  This location is brand stankin new and you can tell the minute you walk in.  You're greeted promptly!  There are about 50 employees all eager to take your order.  One cashier was so overly excited she tried to convince me for an additional five minutes on the benefit of adding a 20 oz.  Pop to my order.  It quickly turned to overkill!!  When I came back in to pick up my order I was instructed to look at The screen behind my head to see if my name appears.  Then I needed to read the screen to see where I am in the order process.  Ok,  ok,, I get it as she was asking do I see it and does my name say it's ready?  She actually wouldn't go look until I followed her instructions.  Gheesh!  I was then forced to eat a piece of their cookie/brownie (ok maybe not forced).  But before I could even leave I had to be reinstructured on how to use the dang on screen again.  Guess I looked like a slow learner!  I am interested in seeing how long the newness stays and looking forward to when it turns into just another location.    And on that note,  they got the crust for my pizza wrong..."}

{"text":"We ordered 2 pizza. First was jalpeno, peperoni, susage...  2nd was bbq sauce intead of tomato sauce, mustroom, olives.  Both has extra cheese  calso cheese bread.. myself and my girl ate it and it was great...."}
{"text":"I would give a zero if l could. Ordered 2 pizzas at 11:56...12:56 no pizzas. I call the location and then was put on hold for 20 minutes. Called back and girl said she called and left me 2 voicemail. No Vm or missed calls. Told her that and began to say yes they did but would have a driver there in 10 minutes and could remake and send them. Ok are you going to refund...well l can for 1 but not both. REALLY...no refund me and keep your pizza.  Horrible"}
{"text":"I came to domino today for the first try. I asked for the small size and the cashier said it will be 10 (It was 10 inch he mean ) And I think it a price . After that he charged me 16.23$ . I did a little research and find out that the small size just 11.99$ . Even if included tax , the total can not be 16.23$ ."}
{"text":"The pizza and the cheesy bread sticks were good. The cinnamon Stix,  some were good, some were really dry.. the icing made it better. The wings were really bad, I don't even think it's real chicken. I would order the cheesy bread and pizza again."}
{"text":"When I crave for Dominos, I expect it to be good but this place is okay.. the pizza sauce was way to sweet for my liking and I told them to do the wings well done and they weren't well done.. I also asked for Extra Sauce (Yip, I like my sauce) and they didn't do that either. The cheesy bread was okay but dry.. I don't like packaged Marinara Sauce.. I prefer it from scratch so it tasted bad with the sauce. The customer service over the phone was decent. My friend Hates Dominos pizza (haven't ate it in over 8 years) and they had a slice and liked it more then me! To each his own Eh? I wouldn't order from here again but you might like it. The pizza wasn't bad, I just didn't care for it. The cinna sticks could have been baked for a longer time.. to be honest the only reason why I order Dominos pizza is for the cinna sticks and I was sadly dissapointed."}
{"text":"Had some last night and they made the pizza Exactly how we wanted it indeed, lol and I got BBQ sauce as the base.. not bad."}
{"text":"I ordered pizza yesterday and it was fantastic, from ease of delivery process to fastness and very polite and lovely delivery man.   I reordered pizza today and it was horrible. Loads of tomato paste put directly on the dough and that is all you can taste. I called pizza place and some girl put me on hold. After 10 minutes! I hung up and called their HQ and there nobody is to service and they left a message to call the local delivery, so I tired again and that chick was all shocked that she left me on hold. I spoke to the owner who said he will refund the money, so that is nice. I also want to compliment the delivery person as this person is an asset to this business. I will however not dare to order from this place as I do not want to go though this again."}
{"text":"Ordered two pizza's -- one was a pepperoni pizza with no cheese. I don't make a habit of checking my pizzas when I order them because back at home (in Irvine) they never mess up my order. When I got home I opened my pizza and it had cheese. No big deal, I can just take the cheese off. Until I went to take it off and discovered that there was no sauce. Instead of a pepperoni pizza with no cheese, I got one with no sauce. I was kind of upset. Called it in and they offered a choice of either remaking the pizza for free, or credit. I chose the former and they upgraded it to a large. The man I spoke to over the phone was very polite. From previously working in the food industry, I understand that things may happen. However it takes all but a couple of seconds to double check an order.  Overall -- they messed up my order, but the customer service was good. Also, my pizza was thoroughly cooked."}
{"text":"Worst place ever I ordered my food in there was a bug melted into my cheese . Then they asked me if I wanted another pizza HELL NO service was rude n food SUCKS"}
{"text":"Online ordering was easy.  Delivery was faster than expected. The food arrived fairly hot. My only complaint is that when delivering to a hotel plates and napkins should be included. Obviously a hotel guest doesn't have these things handy."}
{"text":"My family ordered 2 medium pizzas at 12:10 on a Friday afternoon. Estimated time was 22-32 minutes. It took much longer than that. We are staying at a hotel. The delivery person got here, the food was cold, he didn't offer us plates or napkins (which should be offered when staying at a hotel), and then when paying with a $20 for our $15 order the driver just took the money and left. He didn't ask if we wanted change back or anything."}
{"text":"So yeah, I'm reviewing a chain. I wanted to try the \"new and improved\" Domino's Pizza. Everything those commercials said about their old pizza was true-- cardboard crust, ketchup sauce, bad toppings. So, is the new Domino's better than the old?   Yes, but that's not saying much-- it moves up from negative stars to 1, perhaps1.5 stars. The cheese and toppings are much improved. The cheese abundant and tasty and the mushrooms were thickly sliced whole brown mushrooms. Really good. The sauce was a bit salty and bland-- not horrible, but nothing to write home about.   They still have a problem with the crust. The crust on both mediums we ordered was mushy and underdone. While it wasn't as blatantly offensive as old Domino's crust, it still had a lingering aftertaste like those Bisquick pancakes mom used to try to feed us in the 1970s. Add to that an abundant dusting of garlic salt and you've got a taste reminiscent of your first boyfriend's attempt to make you an \"Italian\" dinner with garlic bread. I had no idea they even made garlic salt any more. It hasn't improved.   So, the pizza has improved, but not enough for me to ever eat it again."}
{"text":"Like most chains of this size, you're going to get a pretty consistent product from location to location.  You either like Dominos or you don't but either way, you know what you're getting when you place your order.  We started ordering from here from time to time a couple of years ago, as it was the closest pizza place to home, and our budget wouldn't always allow gorging on pies from some of the other local places.    Over the course of that time, we have been consistently happy with both the product and the service from this location, which is why we have continued to order from them despite a number of other options in the area.    For what it's worth, Dominos online ordering system is actually very good, which is another reason we keep coming back.   I'm not trying to convince you that Dominos is the best pizza around, but I can say they do a pretty good pizza, quickly and consistently, for not a lot of money.  That seems to be more than a lot of establishments (restaurants or otherwise) can manage a lot of the time, so I'm happy to give credit where it's due."}
{"text":"The manager treated me and other customers like crap! Who hires these clowns? There was a Mexican kid yelling at the guy you made my pie...and it turned out awful! Talk later idiot!  Lousy customer service here...really lousy! Drive a bit and get a better experience."}
{"text":"Quick delivery. Super friendly delivery drivers. But the phone at the store was bad and she couldn't hear me and both orders we put in we're missing one thing. 100 for delivery driver 65 for phone order taker"}
{"text":"These guys are very consistent with making orders right and always fast for delivery. When you don't feel like going anywhere, this is a good option in the Indian Trail area. They always have good specials going to, so you don't have to spend a ton. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Morons! They can take an order but not execute it. How hard is it to make a pizza by specifications?!?!? The people who work here are lazy you can tell by how the pizza is made."}
{"text":"Horrible. I ordered a buffalo CHICKEN sandwich sub they put about three pieces of dime sized thin chicken. They literally gave me a sandwich that's cheese and buffalo sauce. I don't understand why people don't put pride in their work no matter what your job title is. I would never make someone this let alone be okay with sending it out. The only thing they have that's good are the pasta bowls even the pizza is horrible. My boyfriend orders from here I personally hate it but this was just poor work ethic and could have been avoided. I won't be ordering from dominos as a franchise ever again."}
{"text":"The store manager reached out to me regarding my review. He apologized profusely and provided my next meal for free. And guess what, my order was correct. LOL. I enjoyed my meal this time. So I will give them another shot."}
{"text":"Ha!  I called the store cause I had an issue with what appeared in my email from my online order, and the kid on the phone told me that they had to bill me more if I wanted my order.  I told him I already paid for it online, I just wanted pepperoni on half of one of my pizzas instead of the whole thing.  He tells me 'the system will not let him do it'.  I asked for a manager - he tells me the manager is out on a delivery and he can have him call me back.  I told the kid to cancel my order.  The kid tells me that their online ordering system is not working correctly, and (I can't make this up) told me I'm \"better off going across the street to Pizza Hut as he's new to Dominoes and he doesn't even like the food there.\"  I made a complaint online to dominoes.com specifically about this store - asked for a follow up from the GM or regional manager.  Never heard a thing.  Not a phone call, not an email, nothing in writing.  Nothing.  I will NEVER order a pizza from this location again."}
{"text":"The worst experience I've ever had with a Domino's.   The delivery guy was taking forever to arrive so we called the store & the woman on the phone  said she was going to get ahold of him for his ETA & have him call us. We waited another 15 minutes & called again, she then put us on hold & never came back. We called over & over & over and she never picked up the phone again. Both my fiancé & I were calling. We spent 40 minutes calling and gave up. We NEVER received the pizza order and to had to fight the charge with our bank.  ABSOLUTE WORST EXPERIENCE IVE EVER HAD WITH ANY PIZZA COMPANY."}
{"text":"Ordered online and got the wrong pizza. Called to report and after some talking was told I'm never allowed to order there again. All for asking for the correct pizza. If you want the pizza you ordered do not order from here."}
{"text":"This is our 3rd time ordering from this Domino's. They have been the best place we have ordered pizza from. They always get our pizza to our door within 20 minutes and still piping hot. Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"Driver had a really bad attitude. The apartment number was wrong and she asked \"Sooo did you just enter it wrong or what?\" Then she kept me on the phone without talking while she trudged over to my apartment. I apologized for the mix up and she said nothing. The most interaction she had with me at the door, was to ask if this was my credit card?  I still tipped her because I've been a server before, but thinking back maybe I should not have. I would never have been so rude to a customer. The pizza tasted pretty good, but I already had a bad taste in my mouth. Next time I will order from Papa John's or one of the 10 other pizza places near ASU."}
{"text":"This place is okay if you want inexpensive food in a moderately short time frame. But it does have its problems, one of which is rude/incompetent employees. I wouldn't suggest ordering from here frequently, but it's usually not that bad of an experience. Make sure you're clear with the directions you give them. Special instructions sometimes go ignored."}
{"text":"It's simple, basic, but dammit.. it's pizza! They have a rather weak selection of sauces or toppings for the pizza, though I have found a diamond in the rough. The deep dish pizza with extra cheese (+ whatever toppings you want) is a munchie killer of a pizza. The best, unlikely--It's Domino's. But that one recommendation of mine is a good choice."}
{"text":"I used to order pizza from here at least once a week. Ordered 6 pies from here on Saturday for a kids birthday party .. the delivery lady was super nice and she came on time .. I just wished pizza was at least somewhat edible .. the pizza was dry and no flavor  . Tasteless and like eating  plain bread . So so disappointed .. I noticed a change in taste last time I did a carryout and thought it was just that one time, I'm very sorry to say this, but this is the last time we got dominos.. I guess you get what you pay for ...you know the pizza was bad when you have 3 whole pies left over after 12 kids party ..... out of order of 6.."}
{"text":"I am STILL waiting on my order and ordered an hour ago! This location is the WORST if you want your food delivered in a timely manner. I will NEVER order anything from this location or Domino's ever again! Who knows....I'll probably be waiting another hour before it actually gets here. Wait....they're here....and forgot something on my order and now have to go back and get it....REALLY?!!! Domino's Twitter account reached out after I bad-mouthed them on Twitter. Still no dice. Avoid ordering delivery from this dump!"}
{"text":"Wow! Dominos has done a huge turn around. After years of avoiding this place at any cost, I decided to give them another try. Completely shocked. LOVE IT!"}
{"text":"Recently ordered from here while staying at a nearby motel.   The Bad:  Ordered from the Dominos app on my phone like I have other places, then went down to the motel pool with my family, from which we'd be able to see when the pizza-guy arrived. After some time nothing came, so I went to check my phone. I found they had called 30 min earlier to verify my address... which I had meticulously entered. I called them back, confirmed the address was correct, and was told my food was on the way. I was somewhat irate, and told them I was not taking cold food because of their address error, and they should be including something extra to make up for their mix-up.   The Good:  I was told no problem, they'd remake the food, and it would be on its way with some lava cakes. I found that resolution very acceptable.  Received a call a minute later from the manager, I think his name was Joe. He called to ask what was going on, and that his employee had said I was swearing at her. I informed him that I was a bit irate, but not swearing (my kids were present), and that I found her resolution acceptable. He informed me that calling to confirm the address was corporate policy for new order locations... which the app had not informed me of, nor had I encountered it elsewhere. In any case, I told him all was well, and the girl to whom I had spoken handled it to my liking.  The Awesome:  The food arrived pretty quickly after that, not only with lava cakes, but with some sort of big brownie thing that was very tasty. I think they also canceled my entire bill, because it's been a couple days and I do not yet see it on my credit card activity.  Overall they've easily earned my business again, but I left off one star because I don't appreciate their employee lying about me swearing at her."}
{"text":"The only thing Dominos has going for them is fast delivery. I ordered a pizza today for me and my daughter...half the pizza just cheese and the other half pepperoni. I had one piece of pizza with 10 pieces of pepperoni on it and the other 3-4 slices had just 1 or 2. pieces of pepperoni.   I keep seeing commercials on how these pizza makers are \"artists.\" Apparently I got a 1st grade finger painter handling my pizza tonight."}
{"text":"Sure it's a chain restaurant. It's going to be your average run of the mill chain pizza. But I will say this is the only dominos pizza I would ever order from. My pizzas are always made correctly and quickly and it's always satisfying."}
{"text":"Supper friendly cashier he saved me money just recommending kind a pizza I want , I just wait 10 mints a my pizza was Ready highly recommend"}
{"text":"The pizza wasn't horrible,  but the deal was awful.  The prices are extremely high at Dominos in general,  and their medium 2 topping is a rip off.  Low rating is for price vs.  Quality,  and value."}
{"text":"Hadn't had Domino's in years (maybe?) and wanted to try them out to see if they were any better than I had remembered.  They had a killer deal of a 2 topping large pizza for $5.99.  With a deal like that, how could I pass that up?   I placed my order online for a large steak and onion pizza with their garlic white sauce.  Paid with my card online, drove down at my specified time, and they were just getting it out of the oven.  The lady at the shop was welcoming, smiling, and friendly.  The pizza?  Not too shabby!  The toppings were pretty skimp, but overall, the crust was good, the cheese was just enough, and the sauce was tasty.  A tad salty, but not horribly bad where you need to grab a glass of water right away.  Me and my buddy split the pizza and he thought it was pretty tasty.    A $3.00 lunch, per person?  Shit, you really can't eat anywhere for that cheap. It's no Grimaldis, but for the extremely low cost, it is more than serviceable and was a good \"chain\" pizza.  I would not hesitate to order from this Domino's again."}
{"text":"Oh Domino's you devilish little vixen you... walking past your sweet blue signs triggered an Optimus Prime change into a Pepperoni Hunting Robot with Fiendish capabilities for devouring every delicatible bite...   Your pizza's didn't have the dandruff effect of Domino's in Spain (try it there sometime and you'll instantly be in da know) - which is glorious!   Kudo's to the Asian Kid - great service and will be back again on Tuesdays for you 2 for 1 specials!!!  P.S. - we live literally across the street (give or take 4 or 5 houses) and I thought it would be hilarious to have them deliver to our house (across the street) as a joke - low and behold when I was walking home, the neighbor to our building had them deliver a pizza to his house (no comment!)"}
{"text":"Ordered from here this evening and ordered quit a few things and got a call back saying they only had 1 lava cake when we ordered 2, which would have been fine if it wasn't for the extremely rude service we had received on this call. It started with a guy who couldn't hold a conversation in English (no judgement) and passed it to a girl, who then gave no options to fix the situation and gave no compromise to what i would have liked to have in place of that, after the awkward 15 second pause of her wanting me of the phone and as i was talking to her she hung up the phone in my ear. I will never order from here again. I would rather drive to a further location for good customer service then go somewhere close and get bad service.   I hope the owner reads this, and as someone that serves everyday customer service is key and i would NEVER give someone the service we had tonight  Please give that girl proper customer service."}
{"text":"It may seem biased since I used to work here, for two years, but I mean this quite sincerely and by extensive experience:  If you like Domino's, order from here. They only deliver to a certain area, and if you live outside it, get it for carryout and come in to this store. Because it is by FAR the friendliest, cleanest, flat out best Domino's in Champaign AND Urbana."}
{"text":"I was threatened by the delivery driver after he messed up my delivery address. this is after I talked to him. I got no where which the corporate office also."}
{"text":"OK, it was kinda fun to watch the little man on my computer screen \"take\" my order and fake-make my pizza and send it off for delivery in real-time. It was a little startling to hear him address me after the delivery to tell me he hoped I enjoyed the food!  Geekiness aside, the food was made and delivered in under 30 minutes. The driver was friendly and the food was good. I don't know if they're all the same but this one has a variety of sub sandwiches, various chicken wings, miniature parmesan cheese bites (sort of like mini soft pretzels with parmesan), and , of course, pizza. They also have pasta meals.  If you're in a hurry for a quick fix, this place will do."}
{"text":"So you have an open kitchen concept where customers can watch their food being prepared and you still don't use sanitary precautions?  Food made with bare hands.  They'll touch the computer, the counter, the register, sauce bottles, the telephone while preparing food... This establishment needs to be shut down for unsanitary reasons... Give me my damn money back, filthy asses"}
{"text":"I have never had an issue until today with dominos, I recently moved and have only ordered from here once before... We were delivered the wrong pizza out of an order of multiple things... Yet when I called they knew exactly what was happening... I paid almost 50$ including tip... I had ordered extra sauce and extra toppings and paid for the extra... When I received my right order after waiting for a total of almost 2 hours It was anything but \"extra\"! And nothing was given for the mistake... The manager didn't even apologize...non the less I will not order from this store again. Very rude."}
{"text":"Great pizza. Quick delivery. Cool."}
{"text":"Ordered from this Domino's a couple times, and I have to say, I was quite happy with the result. We had the pizzas one time and the oven-baked sandwiches another, and while I could go on about either one (the sandwiches are to die for!), what really counts is that they were friendly, punctual, got our orders right, and the food was delicious. Service times are a little higher for this location than others I've ordered from, so the delivery guy didn't get to our door quite as promptly as I'd have hoped, though it's forgivable because I think this location services a larger area than many others due to the odd layout and lower amount of delivery businesses in the area. When we lived on the northeast side of Vegas, there were a lot more restaurants that delivered to our area, and times were lower as a result. We didn't have to wait over-long, and they were still quicker than the Pizza Hut that delivered to our apartment off Rainbow and Russell, so they remain my pizza delivery place of choice. The food arrived hot, another problem we had regularly with the Pizza Hut in the area. Maybe it's because they're faster, or maybe it's because Domino's has a better pizza delivery conveyance sleeve that keeps the food more insulated. Maybe their delivery guy is a fire wizard and kept the pies and sandwiches hot with the power of his mind, it could really be anything. The point is that the food arrived hot, which is intrinsically important to any delivery business--hot things should be hot and cold things should be cold. If I wanted to eat cold pizza, I'd go to the corner market, buy one, cook it, and leave it on the counter for a far lesser cost. The delivery guys were always friendly to boot, as were the staff members that I called in to order from, so I'd definitely recommend ordering from here if you live in the area instead of Pizza Hut."}
{"text":"Honestly the worst experience I have ever had with a pizza delivery. I could have went to the store bought all the ingredients Used YouTube to learn how to make dough and then proceeded to make enough pizzas to feed a small army before I received what I ordered. It only took 2 hours and 15 mins to deliver a pizza and a pasta bowl. Guess that's not to big of a deal since there store still has not picked up my phone call."}
{"text":"The girl working here late nights is so sweet and nice all the time! Domino's is good for when you have that pizza craving but everything else is closed. Definitely happy with the service because who else would still treat people nicely that late at night? Very impressed."}
{"text":"well, first off they lied to us about their special and told us we could only get one topping per pizza when clearly advertised on the window was two topping.  While I'm sure this wasn't out of malice, just negligence, it was annoying.  My black olives prefer to be accompanied by mushrooms.  Secondly, their crust is the wonder bread equivalent of pizza dough.  Soft, airy and no chewiness at all.  I think we will stick with Little Caesars from now on when we want cheap pizzas."}
{"text":"Went here last night with my boyfriend and my gluten free, dairy free friend. We got two gluten free pizzas with no cheese (she took one for lunch today), a medium Wisconsin 6 cheese, and a chicken parmesan sandwich. We also got 8 bone in hot wings. The sandwich was quickly devoured by my boyfriend and I tried a bite... it was good! The Wisconsin 6 cheese pizza was amazing, lots of cheese and just the right amount of crispy. The gluten free pizzas my friend said were really good as were the wings. Total came to about $57 so it is a little on the expensive side....but it was all good, and not many places have the gluten free crust."}
{"text":"I must say I was pleasantly surprised today when we ordered 2 deep dish pizzas.  They were actually really good.  Several years ago, they were advertising how they needed to improve their recipe. When they did, we were still not impressed.  Over the years though they must have been tweaking the recipe because they were both great.  One was pepperoni and black olives and the other was just extra cheese.  The order was called in and Glen took our order, he we very friendly, easy to understand (another pet peeve of mine is when the person on the phone talks so fast you can't even understand their name or the business name).  Glen took our order and answered all my questions.  I didn't feel like he was just trying to rush through the order to get to the next caller.    When we arrived 15 minutes later to pick up the order, it was piping hot and ready to go.  It must have just come out of the oven!!  Good job Dominos on this establishment and the improved flavor."}
{"text":"This is the closest Dominos and since theyve changed ownership, they been killin it! Pizzas are AMAZING! Toppings are generous, cheese is on point....CHEESE SHOULD ALWAYS BE ON POINT! They know how to do it right. Looks like they a bunch of college students in there, You know that young gunnas like Pizza VS stanky old staff!  Recommended Dominos location!"}
{"text":"I cannot accurately rate how well the food is for I have yet to receive my delivery. This location is now 0/2 on delivery my pizza to the correct location. Looking at the glass half full, at least I am 2/2 at making someone's day with a free pizza. I would recommend carry out from this location, maybe they wouldn't fuck that up"}
{"text":"It's a great place to order pizza in town, at least for me. They usually deliver the pizza very quickly during the week days, but I don't know about the weekends."}
{"text":"The employee was very nice and all, but when I asked why the employee that was making the pizza's wasn't wearing gloves, the one guy who was assisting customers at the register told me that \"everything is pre-cooked and so the girl doesn't need to wear gloves.\"                                                             That definitely sits uneasy with me! What if she accidentally got something in the pizza?? Very gross. I won't be coming back here!!!"}
{"text":"This Domino's is on the border between four and five stars. Very good service, I often order delivery a few days in a row every now and then (who doesn't love Pizza?). I usually get the \"two medium two topping pizza\" deal along with an order of lava cake and it always comes to a total of $19.97 with the delivery fee (My delivery always comes in less than 30 mins since I live nearby). Their crust is the utmost delicious crust out of all the pizza companies. Domino's pizza will always be the #1 pizza for me.   So why the four, and not five stars? The reason being that, sometimes there are days that I get a pizza with a crust that doesn't have much flavor (A few times I get one that tastes pretty plain and bland) or days where my lava cake doesn't have any powdered sugar that it usually always comes along with (which makes it taste more plain to me). Not only that, but, I once also got my pizza with one of the toppings missing (I'm not one to really complain so I just sucked it up).   However, when it comes down to it, we're all human and we make mistakes from time to time. It's not like any of those mishaps were major or anything, but they were manageable (for me at least)."}
{"text":"Disclaimer: my husband and his family are all Italian, I have eaten pizza made from a price winning Italian cook. I make my own pizza, from scratch, as well. This review is not comparing Domino's Pizza to our pizza. This review is comparing a chain restaurant, a franchise to what I have eaten out there. Their pizzas have come a very long way! We ordered the hand tossed Pacific veggie pizza, and two other customized pizzas, they were very good. We did not get sick from their cheese after eating it. The price is right. The service has improved since 12 mo. ago. Their wings are nothing special and pricey. Forget their desserts. So this place is good for a quick take-out pizza. We did ask that our pizzas be cooked well, it makes a difference."}
{"text":"WOW, This is the first time in a decade, last time for Dominononononz. What the heck is wrong with you, nasty pizza, luke warm, over priced dough with a little cheeses and something cross contaminated as my wife got ill and her throat swollen, ears got hot an rd, pure case of an allergic reaction. $16 to get ill. She called them, the Manager said no way we cross contaminated it we clean the slicer after every use. Hello wake up so now it is the customer who caused it. REALLY stop making pizza and go out of business already. Do not order from here your dealing with an unaccountable bunch of parasites who are not clean and do not know about food safety clearly!"}
{"text":"So I tried ordering a pizza after I got off of work and I decided to get Domino's. The only reason why I wanted it was because I checked the hours and they said they don't close till 2amf for carryout. So on my way to go pick it up the door was locked there was no one there I called and a girl answered and said \"Please hold\" and just hung up the phone so I went back to the door and that when she opened the door and said they don't carry out at this time (12:30ish) so I got no pizza no nothing. This store needs to get their hours straight. Will not be coming or thinking of coming here again lucky they can get at least 1 star.."}
{"text":"Fresh ingredients & fantastic tasting pizza. There are several Coupons you can use when you order (click COUPONS across the top menu bar). The webapp for your phone is usually better than the website.  The PAN pizza may be what you want to order, but it is only available in medium. It includes a thicker crust, and is definitely worth the $2 on top.  There are 2 coupons in particular which I like:   * 2 medium 2 topping pizzas $15.99 (reg $27.18) https://order.dominos.ca/en/pages/order/?redirect=/section/Coupons/category/All/#/order/coupons/new?code=3211&qty=1   * 3 medium 3 topping pizzas $24.99 (reg $44.67): https://order.dominos.ca/en/pages/order/?redirect=/section/Coupons/category/All/#/order/coupons/new?code=3415&qty=1   * 3 large 3 topping pizzas $32.99 (reg $53.37) https://order.dominos.ca/en/pages/order/#/order/coupons/new?code=4415&qty=1  Great service with timely completion. A digital menu screen displays how much time is left until your order is complete. You can also view some of this order-progress information on the web. Gets the order exactly as you wanted it with well-assembled pizza. Takes about 10 minutes to finish your pizza."}
{"text":"We ordered a pizza for delivery, and waited 2 and a half hours with no delivery. Called and the manager said they overlooked the order, we asked for a full refund and they gave us $10 off.  Delivery guy finally showed up and we had already ordered chinese.  Horrible customer service.  If the pizza is over 2 hours late, give it for free.  Better yet, NEVER order from a pizza place that takes 2 hours to deliver!!!"}
{"text":"We just left this location because we waited in the order lobby for 10 minutes while a worker was on his cell phone never even looked up to acknowledge that we were there!"}
{"text":"I guess I order from these guys because you get a lot of pizza for the buck when you order on the buy one get one free Tuesday deal - but the first couple of times I ordered they messed up my orders big time.  I was REALLY angry the first few times.  The pizza is OK - and if you throw most of the two pizzas you can get cheaply on Tuesdays into the freezer you can have pizza for a week or two at $5 a meal.  The deep dish is fairly nice.  But I believe the reviews about idiots working there.  Update:  They are getting much better at getting the order right - and it's very helpful that when I call they see my phone number on their call display and when I ask for delivery they instantly ask if it's for Apt xx, xxxx Street.  And then I just say can I have the same order as last time.  Very nice that they've got the last order on file and it is VERY QUICK to get food sent out fast with very little hassle.  But I'm going to have to spread the meals out more.  Eating so much pizza leaves me feeling - like - well - you know.  Too much and you feel like a broken down blob.    But the deep dish is nice with tasty soft crust."}
{"text":"I've tried many Pizza places (I eat take-out way, WAY too much) - and I have to say that Domino's is actually one of the best Pizzas around (I'm talking their deep dish).  But the reason I'm writing this review is that I just tried their Chocolate Lava Crunch Cake - and OMG - I've been looking for Chocolate cake like this for my entire life!  Words CANNOT describe how INCREDIBLY good this cake is.  It's crunchy on the outside and liquid chocolate on the inside - and SPECTACULAR!  I've had somewhat similar chocolate lava cakes from some other pizza restaurant (I think it was a pizza place - but, sorry, I can't remember where) - and they were OK - but these cakes are OUT OF THIS WORLD!  I understand that they cook them in their pizza ovens - and I didn't think I would want cake as well as pizza - but darn - I wish I had two stomachs.  I'm afraid I'm going to be ordering from Domino's EVERY Tuesday now to take advantage of their buy one pizza and get a second one free (this is actually a VERY good deal) - and I have to admit that I may be ordering these choc. cakes by the dozen.  And if my description hasn't yet sold you on these cakes - I think they may be the best thing I have EVER eaten!  They are SO rich and SO chocolaty - absolutely amazing."}
{"text":"It's great because there open late and after reading the reviews we figured we better pick it up instead of having it delivered. We were in an out in a few minutes and decided to also buy the lava cake desert. It was really good but very sweet definitely a sugar rush. The pizza was alright but it taste alot better eaten hot than cold because we picked it up by the time we got home it was lukewarm."}
{"text":"Last 2 times we ordered pizza from this Domino's location the dough was sour, had a weird taste, and I got terribly sick from it.  The wings were awful and tough.  Never again. We found Bella Pizza a few weeks ago on Ellsworth & Quadalupe, the freshpizza, dough is made from scratch, NY style, sauce is wonderful.  You will love it!"}
{"text":"The fact you guys charged me for a pizza with no dough says so much about your company. Your drivers and cooks knowingly gave us an extremely poor quality pizza and then took our money and tip for it. This is wrong DOMINOS. THIS IS WHAT CROOKS DO"}
{"text":"Online ordering, nice delivery driver, fast delivery BUT do NOT order the \"boneless chicken\" these are merely poor quality chicken nuggets. I would have rather bought mcdonalds chicken nuggets if that tells you anything. Other than that they're ok  Update: I called the location after noting that my cheesy bread had no cheese in it. The manager is sending out a new order along with an order of regular wings. I believe in second chances. Thanks Justin!"}
{"text":"I am only giving one star because I cannot give zero stars.   I have never written a review on Yelp! but I feel passionate about my experience and the lack of service I was offered with the Dominos franchise. I was on the phone with Dominos (granted it was a little bit later in the evening) for about 30 minutes on hold. At this point I was so frustrated on waiting, so I hung up and called back. As they answered, they informed me that their store in particular was closed and could not do anything about a delivery or a pick up, but that other locations were still open. I explained that I was on hold for a long time - as if they cared. I asked the associate if they could direct me to another store and they replied saying they could not transfer me, but give me a number... fine. However, the number provided did not exist. At this point, I am frustrated. I called the original store again in which they finally answered, told me that I need to keep calling the store located closest in my area and that they cannot fulfill my request, and immediately hung up. I work in retail, and I understand how frustrating it is to provide the best customer service sometimes, but I feel absolutely neglected from those that have answered, and feel disappointed with this franchise."}
{"text":"This was by far the hardest delivery order I've ever placed. If I could give it negative stars I would.   Initially I tried ordering online but then the website got a bit glitchy and wouldn't push me through to my checkout. I had already selected two coupons to use and they were just sort of sitting there in the checkout icon top right, waiting to be completed.   Since I wasn't able to complete the order online I called.  I'm aware that it's a busy time being 9:30 PM on Friday and I was placed on hold after calling. The man that took my order was so incompetent and rude it irritates me.   I kept telling him what I wanted to order and he said that coupon isn't showing up I said online when I select your store these are the coupons that populate for my area and their location and he insisted that I was wrong. Every time I opened up my mouth to say something he would interrupt me cut me off and if I asked a question his answer was not what I asked or he would relay back the information that I literally just said. I told him about the online glitch in the website and perhaps that's why I couldn't use that code he said I was wrong I just said to him that it says you can only use it once and the system might think it's in use. He Argued with me for three minutes then told me to just order online... which is ridiculous and then just hung up on me.   So I called back with a new number and he answered the phone initially but I got placed on hold again and a new guy answered to take my order. Again I understand it's peak time but this gentleman was so hasty and rushing me off the phone it was frustrating and again super annoying.  I was trying to convey my frustrations for the previous call he had zero empathy and kept reminding me that he only has a certain amount of time per call and that I have to order now!! Or order online. I again told him I can't order online that's why am calling in the first place and he was doing so much talking about useless things other than my issue and my order he was wasting his own time.  He Spoke over me he interrupted me also. He eventually did take the order though but that was almost as painful. I said pepperoni and onion on the whole pizza and an extra topping with mushroom on one half and green pepper on the other half. He repeated back to be ok so mushroom and preen pepper on one side.... I said no. Repeat myself then he still wasn't getting it which I find insane considering I KNOW I'm NOT the only person to spilt sides like that for toppings. I literally had to draw him a map and say mushroom on one side and green pepper on the other side. He still wasn't getting it and said something about left and right sides and I reminded him a pizza is an the form of a circle so there really isn't a left and right side of the pizza spins 180 degrees. So then he tells me I should have just said one half mushroom the other half green pepper. ARE YOU KIDDING MEEEE????  I go to talk abd he cuts me off and starts rereading my order back as if I was done and I had to cut him off and ask what kind of dipping sauce there was and he reminded me again that he has to hurry up and take other orders.   I know about Domino's past and their employees putting disgusting bodily fluid's in the pizza so I'm honestly stressed now to eat the damn thing. This was the dumbest and worse interaction for something so simple I've ever experienced. I'm around the corner from them and unable to leave my house at the moment but I can guarantee you I will be telling everybody I know about how incompetent this location is. Their customer service skills are terrible and I'm truly blown away by this whole experience. I'm furious.  Edit:  I'd like to just add that the delivery driver is no prize either I apologized and told him I would like exact change back due to my terrible experience and that it wasn't personal it was more moral for me. The order was just under $27 I said round up and then give me the 13 back because I gave them $40. He hands me $12 back I say I'm missing $1. Then he says no it's 27 I say yes exactly 40 Takeaway 27 is 13. Sit there and stare at change for half a minute in the cold and I say it's just a loony and a seat seven of them in his hand at least and one was literally in the other hand I said just passed me that and then he starts digging through his pile of change I say no you can keep that change. He goes to hand it to me I take the loony I say I just want the loonie and I said OK thank you and I shut the door and he threw the rest of the change at my door!! I repeat he threw money at me essentially. What kind of business are you running domino's?? that is the last straw I will never order from you guys again and I will write every review possible."}
{"text":"I don't know why I keep ordering from this place because it's the worse. Delivery always takes a minimum of an hour no matter how busy the night. The tracker always says it's been delivered when it hasn't. And the driver calls that they are there when they are not. NEVER AGAIN!"}
{"text":"THE WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE EVER!! Amanda from this store gave me the worst attitude when I called. Our pizzas were undercooked, we tried to call back willing To give the pizzas back in return for our money. But all we were offered was credit? Why would I need credit from a dominos in Vegas when I'm from LA?? All I needed was a solution to the problem and I got nothing. Corporate needs to do something about the team member Amanda and the store in general. We threw up because of the pizza."}
{"text":"First time ordering from a Dominoes since I moved to Peoria.  They were extremely quick and efficient.  I was actually surprised how accurate the app was from the time I ordered to the time it was delivered.  Shane, my delivery guy, delivered with a smile and my hot pizza.  Very happy.  Thank you!"}
{"text":"I will never order from this, or any Domino's again, as I am sure that the training that may or may not be done, is the same for each store. I usually do all my ordering online, as it is easier with 3 kids, 2 jobs, and a husband that works graveyard. the start of this horrible journey was 3 orders ago, when I waited outside for my pizza to be delivered because the app said it was on its way, and since my husband works graveyard, I didn't want the door bell rang to make the dog bark and wake up my husband. I literally live 10min from this location. 45min later, the delivery driver gets Rhee and exits his vehicle wearing NO SHOES, and his socks had hole, showing me a very manicured pinky toe. he didn't even bother to try to put his shoes on, just went around to the other side of his car to give me my food. the 2nd time I ordered was a friday night, and again online. I understand it takes longer on fridays, but when my food doesn't show up for over an hour after is says it left the place, that's a little crazy. same delivery driver (he wore shoes this time), and forgot my 4 garlic sauces I ordered and was charged for. he told me he would bring them back, but only after he finished his last 2 deliveries. I went into the house, and opened my pizza, and literally all the cheese was on the roof of the box! I called the store and was told they could remake it, but I wouldn't get it until 2hours later. since I had hu gryphon kids, and it was already 9pm, that wasn't gonna fly. I was offered a credit for a future pizza which I took, since I had no other option. 5 days ago, I called to use my credit for my free pizza. while waiting for my pizza, my oldest son called saying he had been in a car accident, and I needed to go pick him up. I called the store to let them know to NOT deliver my pizza. I would come pick it up after I got my son. I made sure to let then know I would still take care of the driver; they don't make much, and it's not his fault I had an emergancy. I asked that they let the driver know to not deliver it. whoever I talked to assured me it would be no problem. q5min later, I called back just to make sure the driver was called to let him know not to deliver. I talked to the same person I had spoken to on the previous call, and he acted confused. he said \"let me check my carry out\". he came back on the line to say my pizza was ready. I told him I wasn't worried about it, I was more concerned the driver was called and wasn't wasting his time. the guy I was speaking to acted like he had no idea what I was talking about. I then get a call 5 minutes later from my very angry husband, asking why I left if I was having a pizza delivered. they sent the pizza anyway, didn't call the driver, woke my husband up, and set off my security alarm in the process. I called the store immediately following that call, and was told \"Tou got your pizza right?\" and was hung up on. I sent a scathing letter to domino's corporate online, and got a generic response that it needed to be handled with the store I was mad at, and some one would contact me from that store. it's been 5 days, and still no response. I don't like leaving such a long complaint, but I'm hoping SOME ONE from Domino's will read this, and maybe care that the millions of dollars they've spent in the last 7 years cleaning up their image, is being shot by a few people who have dropped the ball. I don't want anything free, and I don't care to order from them again. I would just like to know the situation is being properly handled"}
{"text":"Ordered online.  Over an hour later no pizza was delivered.  I called the store and they blamed the computer stating it was going to be closer to 2 hours for delivery.   Had I known that I would never have ordered.  Two hours for a pizza...seriously???"}
{"text":"Pizza was horrible in comparison to Pizza Hut and Papa Johns. Someone needs to evaluate the quality there. Husband ordered wings, pepperoni pizza with extra cheese and also cheesey bread. Wings were tiny and pizza was not properly made and doesnt appear to have extra cheese."}
{"text":"Food is always good. Enjoy the chicken bacon ranch sub. The only complaint is the stupid status bar when you order online instead of just telling you how long. Should have both."}
{"text":"Ordered two pizzas and was told they would deliver to us (didn't feel like picking it up). The time? Only 20 to 30 minutes. Not joking, two hours later and the pizza got to here, cold and crappy. When I called and wanted my money back the manager first said no because I had the pizza. I was horrified by this conversation between us, he called me a horrible person. When I asked for the managers number I was given his personal cellphone number so nothing would happen. After going to twitter to complain and calling another Domino's for a phone number on putting in a complaint, Domino's got back to me on twitter. After it was all done the pizza was free an the manager (yeah turned out that rude guy was the manager) called me to give the worst apologize. I will NEVER go there again if I was dying of hunger."}
{"text":"Called and ordered a large thin crust for delivery.  Was told 35 to 45 min.  That was ok.  After an hour I called back and was told that was for pick-up.  No.  In our 20 years of doing business with this Dominos we have always had delivery.  Finally the pizza arrived.  COLD.  Guess I will have to find a different delivery shop."}
{"text":"Pizza was cold and flavorless, and the wings were not good at all.  I do no recommend this place. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"Ordered online and got a bread bowl. Took a bite and ended up having to pull another persons hair out of my mouth. F****** DISGUSTING!"}
{"text":"Awesome service, timely delivery, and always fresh! Thanks for making our weekends an awesome night when we are too tired to make dinner. :)"}
{"text":"No complaints here, always receive the correct order and always receive it in under an hour. The food is always hot and delicious. Thanks for being an awesome team and making my food yummy!"}
{"text":"Worst dominoes ever I got a pizza with no cheese no pep. Just Alfredo sauce. When I called back they closed. WTF how does someone just sauce a pizza and put it in an oven with no toppings not even cheese!"}
{"text":"I go to this Domino's location a lot since I live fairly close and when I'm hanging out with friends late at night, their 2 for $5.99 each deal is pretty sweet and convenient. Never had a problem at this place. Everyone was nice. Late at night, most of them are pretty laid back so we have a short conversation as I'm ordering.   Good people, good food. Can't really beat it when it comes to these high-end pizza shops."}
{"text":"Save your time and money and go elsewhere. I placed an order online for carry out waited about 30 minutes, figured I may have to wait a few more minutes since it was a Saturday. When I got there they hadn't even started working on it. The cashier said \"we don't know where your order is\" and said it was going to be another hour while they get through everyone else's order. Mistakes happen, I get that but I wasn't offered an apology, or a hey we're a little busy come back another day and we'll give you a little discount for the inconvenience. Just a tuff titty, you'll have to wait an hour for this pizza. I felt defeated, I just asked for a refund and spent my money at little Cesar's down the street. It wasn't as good as Domino's but at least they actually made my order.I also saved a few bucks. I was in and out after 10 minutes for a custom order. Little ceasers saved our family night. Now excuse me while I go rate little ceasers 5 stars. Never thought I'd be saying that."}
{"text":"Never ever order from here. The people are rude. When I told them that the chicken I ordered smelled and looked burnt they told me I was wrong. I was looking right at it. I told them and they didn't even care. I told them I was going to give them a bad review and that's when they decide to give me a new one. The guy on the phone was arguing back at me and said I was wrong. They are very rude and inconsiderate. They need new people working there that have good customer service. I have never complained about they before. But everything I got was burnt and nasty. Don't go here at all! Never ordering from here again."}
{"text":"I've ordered from this location a lot. You obviously get what you pay for when it comes to fast food pizza chains however I've ordered from a lot of locations. Last week I received my order and it was not made the way I had asked, normally I wouldn't call to complain however ''tis had been the 3rd time in 2 weeks.  I know my review may sound negative from how it started, however far from. Reluctantly I called, expecting the worst and was greeted very warmly by the manager. I had explained what happened and he immediately offered a replacement, what I got wasn't horrible and I was starving so I chose to eat it and didn't want to put them out of their way. Without hesitation he offered me a credit which I redeemed today with ease and they even knew what it was I had ordered so they obviously pay attention to previous orders.   Great customer service from this location, will continue to order with confidence moving forward. Kudos to this location."}
{"text":"This was my last straw with this particular location! Time and time again I have gotten rude drivers who assume my change is their tip, drivers who have blatantly asked for a tip, and drivers who gave up looking for my apartment after my husband and I have ordered countless times hoping it was just a fluke. It's not. These drivers don't care. Tonight we had to wait 2 hours after a driver claimed the address didn't exist and went all the way back to the store. Now we wait while they prepare another order for us. We appreciate them making a new one, but we will not be ordering from this location again. I would rather pick up my pizza from a different location then have a terrible delivery experience."}
{"text":"Though I don't hate the pizza, it isn't my favorite. Papa johns had closed already so we just settled. I downloaded the app and ordered around 11pm. At around 11:30 it said it was out for delivery. Long story short it got here around 2am which is crazy. It was a Monday night!  You can't tell me it was that busy. My fiancé called them four times. Two times she was put on hold and forgotten about and another she was flat out hung up on. We will never order from here again. Have some pride in your work and be as hospitable as possible folks or you're going to lose business like crazy. Should have just gotten pizza today instead. Very disappointing"}
{"text":"With Papa John's and Little Caesar's nearby, there's no reason to pay more for lower quality Domino's Pizza.  I made the mistake of trying and internet promotion and wish I'd spent my money elsewhere.  Carry-out prep time was fast, but I would have enjoyed a Little Caesar's Hot-n-Ready a lot more."}
{"text":"I got the Monday online special, a large 4-topping pizza for $10.99. The pizza was made fast, there was a lot of fresh toppings and the staff was friendly. I definitely will be returning to this location. It's easier to order using the Dominos app and coming in to pick it up, usually by the time you get there it will be ready."}
{"text":"After craving cinnamon sticks for about an hour, I decided to cave in and place a delivery order *bye bye diet*. They unfortunately have a minimum order price if like $8.10 or something weird like that for deliveries. Not sure if that's implemented due to a slow season (summer) or what. But I added on Parmesan Bites and a marinara sauce to bring up the price... And saw that ordering a sauce was extra. I'm not sure why they can't just give customers 1 sauce- do they think a seasoned bread ball will not need sauce?   Overall amazing quality- yum! Like the good was amazing. Order took only 25minutes to arrive which is really good. I just hate when businesses do things to be cheap, especially in one of the busiest, most profitable areas-UNCC."}
{"text":"Ordered a pizza online at 7:12. Called at 9:00 to see what the status was. Was put on hold for 15 minutes. Delivery driver finally came at 9:20. So much for the 61-71 minute wait. This is the second time this has happened to me."}
{"text":"Haven't had anything from Domino's Pizza for years, but decided out of convenience to try it again recently.  Pizza was rubbery and cold, chicken bites we're tough and cold. They charged me twice on my Visa card for the same delivery and then when I called back to manager Michael to get them to take the second charge off he refused and lied to me about the details of the financial transaction."}
{"text":"I use Dominos iOS app to order pizza, it places orders from this store. Recently the delivery takes forever some times more than an hour, and pizza arrives cold , and on the top of that recently the add a lot a lot of pizza red sauce, they add triple times of usual i have no idea why. Overall experience is unsatisfactory."}
{"text":"Don' t bother. Thin crust crispy but too dry and powdery. Toppings few and far between.  Oreganos and even Pizza Hut better options."}
{"text":"I spent a full year not ordering from Domino's because of the previous incident and review I wrote last year. I was trying to be optimistic in the new year this location would've gotten it's act together by now. Perhaps with new staff.  I ordered online a few days ago (on the 20th of Feb). Used an online coupon. Medium pizza, pepperoni, mushrooms. I keep it simple. Pizza arrived nearly an hour later. Mind you my Domino's is literally around the corner from me a 4 minute drive away. The delivery driver's pin fell apart when he went to hand it to me. I went inside my home, grabbed a pin, signed the receipt and actually gave him my pin. No real appreciation from the delivery driver. Almost asked for it back.  Got back inside since it was freezing outside, sat down, opened the pizza, and noticed it was missing the mushrooms. Naturally, I called up and asked for the manager. Was connected to a woman who said she would credit my account. No real apology or accountability given of course. Almost as if, I'm bothering her for calling about my order not being correct.  Fast forward to tonight 4 days later. I figured, meh, I'll use up that credit now. I called up and a guy answers the phone with, \"hello?\". Seeing that I called the number from the e-mail I received from my order the first time I knew I had the right number and proceeded to tell him, \"I have a credit on my account from a mishap a few days ago and would like to use it tonight please\". His response was, \"uhhh like, wut, you wanna credit your account?\" I kid you not. So, I repeat myself with a little more bass in my voice. He puts me on hold. A few moments later, I'm connected with what sounds EXACTLY like the same woman I talked to a few days ago. Again, I mention that I want to use my credit. Her response? \"I don't see any credits on your account\". After asking her how that could even be possible since I was almost positive it was her I spoke to, her response was, \"It wasn't me. We have a lot of girl's that work here.\" So, there's a lot of girls that are Managers with the ability to credit accounts at this tiny location? Or, are you not a manager to begin with and are just telling customers whatever they want to hear to get them off the phone? Eventually, she offers me a large pizza, but at this point I don't even want it. At this point, I'm appalled since this isn't my first rodeo with this clown show Domino's.  After some back and forth and me threatening to send off a complaint directly to Domino's Corp and her response being, \"whatever, go ahead\", I've come to a realization. This Domino's hires some of the most horrible, classless, shameful, unprofessional, and irresponsible human beings in town. I advise anyone who reads this that values their sanity, moreover their hard earned money, to eat someplace else. This place is a joke!"}
{"text":"Rude staff, would not honor coupon that appeared online and was added to my order beforehand (again online). Offered no solution or alternative coupon--and demanded that I pay full price or leave. Also said that I couldn't change my order online myself. The staff in general is both incompetent and unhelpful every time I've been there.   What kind of customer service is this? The floor/pizza prep area was also dirty both times I went. This pizza is very meh, nothing spectacular at all--SO not worth a trip especially as there are many kinder, more competent, and better pizza places nearby."}
{"text":"One star is way too much for this place. Worst customer service, we ordered our pizza, 2 hours later and still no pizza, we called to ask about it and the guy who answered hung up the phone. These people are really good at hanging up the phone on you it seems. Not sure why this place is still in business, and is still running. Won't be ordering from them again!"}
{"text":"The website might have some challenges but the pizza is great and always ready when I walk in the door - good stuff"}
{"text":"Conveniently located next to the Siskey YMCA, it's the perfect place to pick up a pizza in your way home from the pool or gym. The pizza and service have been good. We like the new crust and carry-out deals."}
{"text":"I was at the dominos pizza because I love! But the attendant lady that got my order was unfriendly and I had awful service , I will never comeback in this location, by the way the pizza was very good like always."}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of Domino's. Their iPhone (or Droid) app is easy to use, or you can quickly place an order online. Either way, you can track your pizza to see when it goes into the oven. This way you can plan your pickup so you pick it up as soon as it comes out!  The staff here are super friendly. I've been known to call in and ask if their are any super secret discounts. Not sure if it's my uber sexy phone voice or if they just like to humor me, but there are always coupons available!  The only downfall of this location is that the parking sucks! Once you battle for a spot, run in and grab your pizza, you then have to deal with the hustle and bustle of the traffic of the surrounding businesses. People are pulling in at full speed off of Camelback, making backing out of your spot seem scary. In some cases, you even have to park on the side street (it's easier to get out that way anyway!)  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Pizza is ok  We don't get delivery because it takes too long  Customer service can be much better  The one other reason I will never go back is when I ordered last week walked in and waited . The young guy making the pizza came to take my order without washing his hands wiped his hands on his pants and then was ready to help me.   When I said no thank you he went right back to making pizza no hand washing.  Not good."}
{"text":"Location is clean and order was on time. A large complaint is that they don't deliver to my parents house which is 6 miles or approximately 10 minutes away - all streets, no highway. So we often stick with poppa johns which is ironically further and delivers with no problem. Did you order breadsticks? Want dipping sauce? That's extra. Want fake cheese with your pizza? That's also extra."}
{"text":"Tried ordering over the phone and it kept ringing for 20 minutes and hung up on me once.  This company is going down hill fast"}
{"text":"Very happy with my pizza and wings. Munara was super polite and prompt. A great late night place to get dinner or a snack! Would order from this location again :)"}
{"text":"Pedí mi orden y estuve esperando a que llegara en el lobby de mi hotel por UNA HORA. Nadie llegó ni nada, y estuve todo el tiempo usando el tracker de la orden que de nada sirvió. Pésimo servicio. No recomendado."}
{"text":"I ordered 2 pastas, a boneless chicken and a specialty sandwich.  The pastas were cold, the chicken was undercooked and there was a hair in my sandwich.  I called to tell them and they told me that the chicken is okay that's how they serve it for everyone. If they put it threw twice it burns and acted like it was no big deal. They were trying to argue about the chicken, I didn't even address the other issues. I hung up. Will NEVER go back again."}
{"text":"This Domino's location caught me off guard with great service, quick turn around and fresh tasting pizza! My go to, is now Domino's!"}
{"text":"I have to say, Domino's customer service is pretty amazing so far.  They contacted me immediately and put me in touch with an area manager who emailed me, apologized, and will cover the pizza.  Which I didn't even request they do.  This is outstanding -- everyone, myself included, have \"off days\".  If you own them and correct the situation, that is all anyone can ask.  Way to build customer loyalty!"}
{"text":"Absolutely horrible customer service! Apparently, the zip code on my account was wrong and my online order went to this store instead of my normal store. I was placing an order using my rewards points that I earned for being a loyal customer (despite the fact that their online app and ordering system is a tremendous hassle, every time I use the app or attempt to log in online it requires me to re-enter my password even though I've selected for them to remember me. To make matters worse it never recognizes my password even though I'm 100% positive that it's correct because I just had to change it yesterday, so as a result I literally have to go through the password change process every time I order a pizza from them) but I regress, I was using my loyalty points to order a pizza, the manager of this store called me to say that they incorrectly received my order and that I need to go online and 'edit' my order. They do not offer an option to edit your order after it has been placed, so I asked if he could send it to the store that delivers in my area. He responded with a rude, smug remark about how that's now his job and he doesn't have the ability to do that and that since they don't deliver in my area that he could and was going to do was cancel my order. As a result, my reward points were stolen from me, I lost 30-45min of time waiting to reorder and get a pizza from the correct location and had to pay full price for it! The moral of the story is, don't be tricked by their bull shit rewards/ loyalty program! Not only is it a hassle to log in and use their sub par app or web site, but it's a complete SCAM! Save yourself the hassle and order from one of the numerous other pizza joints in your local area. At the very least, avoid this specific location due to the poor customer service and rude staff employed here!"}
{"text":"My issue was I placed an online order, when the delivery guy came to drop off my pizza I realized it was wrong and called Dominos as soon as I opened the box. The girl was prompt to tell me that they will switch it out with my right pizza and will bring lava cakes to apologize for the inconvenience. That the person who is delivering it would be about 25-35 mins. Okay, so not bad for a messed up order the attempted to fix it. Well now almost an hour from when I called, I call back to see if everything was okay and if the person may have gotten lost with my order. I was rudely told that they sent someone out and it should be coming soon. I asked if there why was there a hold up with my order and she persisted to say that they have my phone number that it should be fine and rudely hung up. I've never had an issue with dominos until now and will consider not ordering again."}
{"text":"Well i think i have finally thrown in the towel with dominos and officially with this location.   I dont discriminate with pizza places - i do the local joints, big chains and everything in between.   I eat pizza all the time so this is a painful review to do. More to come on the pizza eater \"label\"   I ordered a large brooklyn pizza...well done and extra sauce. I always go and pick up my pizzas because i always get a hot and fresh pizza that way.  I stop in, pay for my pizza and get in my car. I opened up the box and i have a raw, sauceless pizza. I bring it back in very politely - one offs happen. No clue if this was the manager but this woman says do u want us to make u a new one or just put this one back in the oven? Did she REALLY just say that? (In my head)Yes i want you to pick the pizza up with your hands and put it back in the oven. Im sure thats gonna turn out GREAT.  The nicest young guy grabs the box and says im going to make this right for you.   Minutes later, a new gentleman comes out with this slight crisp pizza with no sauce and looked like they folded it over twice.   I just shook my head and left. I wasnt going to wait AGAIN for a simple cheese pizza.   I brought it home and tried to cook it in the oven to somehow save this thing but i had a half a piece and threw it out and all of my friends and family know i would NEVER throw out pizza, its a sin.   All in all. I knew what i was getting into with a chain pizza place but come on!"}
{"text":"I just had the best experience ordering from the central store 7651 because of the manager Brandy! There was a mix-up with my order and she was so kind and professional. She is definitely going to be the reason why I will order my pizza and amazing garlic knots with Domino's and not any other pizza establishment! It's hard to find good service these but because of the manager Brandy at the Domino's my faith is restored in excellent customer service! Way to go Brandy! Killing it girl!"}
{"text":"Despite the doubts you may have about Domino's, this on-campus location is the best bang for your buck. Mon-Thur they have a large three-topping deal for $8.64 (including tax). If that's not a good deal I don't know what is. Domino's also accepts M&G from ASU students. A great late night snack option."}
{"text":"I ordered for delivery, my phone was on silent he called twice. about 2 minutes later i called back he said he left and went to another delivery. was very rude to me and said you will just have to go pick it up at the store. will never order from them again."}
{"text":"Fast, friendly and always tasty. Ben there 100+ times. Ordering online is great."}
{"text":"Ordered a 3 topping pizza and an Italian sandwich (?). I had ordered an Italian hoagie but that's not what I got. I got this thing that was more like a calzone. The sandwich wasn't too bad but the pizza was the worst I have ever had.  What was ordered was a large pizza with sausage,bacon and pepper. What I got was a cold cheese pizza that was cold and soggy with the toppings warmed up and thrown on top of the cold cheese pizza. The pizza was so soggy that it bent when you tried to lift it and all the toppings fell off and into the box. I plan on making a complaint to the health department for foods not kept at the right temps."}
{"text":"Ill never order from here ever again seriously carry out is 37 minutes? Was dropping my Bike at Giant next door and I usually order from my Dominos at Chaparral and Hayden. 2 people working this place and attitude up the ying & yang with the blonde with everyone that walks in...."}
{"text":"Emily is the most unprofessional person I've met. If I could rate zero stars I would. The pizza wasn't even good& it took way to long to get. Eff this place"}
{"text":"I used to goto this Dominos about once a week when they had just released the new pizza. And you know what, it wasn't that bad if you ordered it without the overpowering garlic crust. Plus, this location had a carryout special for a large one topping for $4.99. Hard to beat that.   I went back and they had the same deal, but offered made to order pizzas instead. So you don't have to call ahead, they just have them there in an incubation chamber or some shit. The difference is, these were like super-processed pizzas and totally nasty. I was hoping this sketch area could provide some decent, cheap pizza but I was wrong. Fuck Dominos. They suck. I would say that the employees here are usually nice."}
{"text":"Think I had a review of this one from a while back, don't see it anymore, but whatever. They've been getting better only because it's impossible to get worse. The new online ordering system is solid."}
{"text":"Quality of pizza is probably good for price about 50% of the time.  Customer service still horrible.  Someone needs to teach the workers how to resolve customer complaints."}
{"text":"I only gave a 2-star rating because of the very nice female cashier but the cook(Brandon) was very rude.The cashier asked him for the keys to unlock the cash register after I purchased my carryout and was waiting to pay and the cook aggressively threw the keys from the kitchen to the female cashier in the register area and over the counter almost hitting me in the face, without any apology or regard for his very unprofessional and negligent actions. I felt very taken back as a customer that an employee would act in such a disgusting manner and not have any regard for customer safety and overall safety in general.this employee's actions have deterred me from wanting to ever step foot in this location again."}
{"text":"This is probably the worst service I have ever gotten. We ordered and it took over 2 hours to get our pizza. The tracker said it was on it's way. When you call they say they are \"busy\", after they put you on hold multiple times for extended periods of time. We decided to give this place one more chance, sure enough it was over 2 hours late before I called and told them to cancel the order. 30 minutes later the driver showed up insisting  I take it and that it was hot. I almost closed the door in his face. I don't understand how Domino's corporate office hasn't handled this yet."}
{"text":"me and my bf ordered pizza over the phone when the lady answered she was rude and when we come pick it up the people were very rude! not customer service oriented! be nice people! lava cake burn! pizza over done and COLD!  not going back this place!"}
{"text":"We love the pizza! Extra sauce every time and it's so good! It's delivered hot and by great delivery people,as they are very kind and cheery.We are on a tight budget with 5 children,so the online coupons are a big help and their are many coupons to choose from.I would give this a 5 star rating with the exception that when I have ordered during lunchtime,they call me back and say they don't have a driver in for work yet.That's a little inconvenient,but it's worth the wait!!!!"}
{"text":"Twice now we have had problems with this location!  We have ordered with them many times, but tonight was bad. We ordered out for delivery, waited for an hour, and still no pizza. So we called and the guy on the phone said oh you are new customers so we tried to call and didn't deliver. We never got a call from them! And we aren't new customers! In fact we are not customers at all anymore to this location."}
{"text":"At about 12:45 AM today (3/27/11) Jen S. and I had just gotten off of work and were chillin' at her place watching a horrific movie (Morning Glory.) We were in need of food but of course, most restaurants off the strip were closed. Luckily, this specific Domino's was open and delivered to her apartment!  Our pizza and breadsticks were delivered in less than 25 minutes from the time we ordered, which was great and the pizza was scalding hot. I always liked Domino's and I dig their new recipe as well. For $16 we got out cheap. My only complaint is that their dipping sauce has way too much basil in it.   I'd say this is a solid option for late night on the west side."}
{"text":"Waited two hours for one pizza and breadsticks. Never came. Place will not even pick up their phone. Disgraceful service."}
{"text":"The gluten-free crust was awful! My pizza was also over cooked and most of the bottom crust was burned, which I did not check til I got home."}
{"text":"We order from this Domino's all the time. They always do a fantastic job with pizza & wings. Their Philly Cheese Steak Sandwich is also really good. Ordering online is super easy & the Domino's Tracker with Pete the Pizza Maker is so nice. Knowing when it will be delivered is extremely helpful -- especially since we have 4 dogs who bark like crazy when the doorbell rings. :)"}
{"text":"The website is designed to rip you off.  You click om the coupon for PAN pizza and when you go to the build screen it defaults to handtossed.  Why would i click on a PAN coupon if i wanted the cheaper hand tossed pizza???   Feeling ripped off..."}
{"text":"the sweetest, kindest people work here! i absolutely love ordering from this Dominos location because they are always so happy and patient with me! EVERY single time! I've never had a bad experience with them!!! :) On the phone, delivery, or when I come in for pick-up, they are all so nice and enthusiastic :)"}
{"text":"This location is closest to my house.  I very rarely order pizza (weird, huh?), but for some reason it is all I wanted this night.  I called to see what kind of specials they were offering, and they said it depended on if I wanted delivery or pick-up.  I said it depended on how long the pizza would take for either, and decided on pick up when it was only going to take about 30 minutes.  They have a weekday (Monday-Wednesday only) special of a large 1 topping pizza for $5.99 or a large 3 topping pizza for $7.99.  Seemed like a pretty good deal, and we ended up adding parmesan bites for $1 as well.  The pizza was hot, fresh and delicious and I was super happy with the service.  I will definitely be ordering from this Domino's again!"}
{"text":"This place is decent. Been to a few different dominos and quality is inconsistent. This place however is on par.  I always order the hand tossed thin pizza (Canadian pizza) and never had a problem.   Only reason it's not more than a 3 because this is a franchise. No way you can compare this with the mom and pop pizza shops."}
{"text":"I've ordered Pizza from here in the past. I picked up my order. Great Pizza, can't complain. I'll definitely go back again."}
{"text":"Pizza was burnt, delivery took more than an hour. The delivery man was rude and didn't smile or greet me in any way, then he proceeded to called me a cheap ass when I didn't tip him. Not sure what he was expecting with that attitude ... but at least try to act nice and never ever criticize a paying customer. I don't know what wages he gets paid, but I work minimum wage too, and you are not entitled to my extra dollars just because the card machine asks for tip."}
{"text":"Fast service. Nice delivery guy. Pizza is pretty good for A chain company like Dominoes. Way better than Pizza Pizza which seems to be the gold standard for quick take out pizza for parties."}
{"text":"I order from this location quite frequently. I order every two weeks. In the beginning this location did all right, but they have really stepped up their game. I always get all my items on my order, my food is always warm, and they get here pretty fast. The quality and taste of my food is good. The drivers are very nice. I recommend this location. Keep up the good work guys!"}
{"text":"The last two times I ordered my pizza took almost an hour and half to arrive. They forgot my drink, food was cold. 3 stars might be too much but their drivers are nice and the other times I've ordered it was fine. Step it up guys"}
{"text":"It took them nearly an hour to get my pizza to me when their tracker said 34 minutes.  The delivery women asked me 3 times if i paid her enough,  not sure if she was hinting that I didn't tip her for being late or if she didn't know how to do math.  Pizza and chicken was cold even though it's 98° outside.  Won't be ordering from here again."}
{"text":"Worst experience ever...my family was expecting good Pizza, instead we got a stale cheese Pizza, the other one was a bacon cheeseburger, only one problem....no bacon or meat. They were an hour delivering it and my entire family is disappointed...called the mgr and they refunded my money but still.....I'll never order from this location or a dominoes again."}
{"text":"Apparently they were pissed at me about a customer service issue during a previous order... They didn't bother to cut the pizza, there was way too much cheese, and it was cold. Tried to speak to the manager... And the manager 1) yelled at me 2) told me he didn't care. 3) had to run outside and smoke a cigarette and talk on his cell phone... Definitely disappointed once again and won't be bothered by giving the store on Warner and Arizona Ave my business again. Not to mention when I called to place my order the manager stated \"Oh you're the one that complained about us to corporate\"..... Ha! Great customer service guys! Obviously things can't be fixed at a store level... In my opinion the company needs to hire mystery shoppers to see just how horrible this store is!"}
{"text":"Ordered pizza on fight night and it wasn't there when I got there! $100 for the fight and I'm waiting for them to remake my whole order. However, my order was free and it was ready in the promised timeframe of ten minutes so good save Dominos!!! You still rock!"}
{"text":"Girl that charged me went on and played with her cellphone and headphones, touched dirty cabinets, dirty computer keyboard and then went straight to the pizza dough and started making pizzas. Disgusting! Never coming back!"}
{"text":"The card reader doesn't work, they don't have any plates, staff was rude about it. Workers were eating pizza when I came in to pick up order.  We just left and wife found hair in our pizza and pineapple on her cheese and mushroom pizza. She hates pineapple. Won't be back here."}
{"text":"Domino's isn't usually my \"go to\" for pizza but my work sent everyone a $10 coupon for National Cheese Day. So I ordered my pizza online and all good.  Lots of choices with the web ordering site with different crusts (I chose the thin), lots of sauces (I chose the spicy) and of course lots of toppings (I chose mushrooms and onions). The pizza arrived about 40 minutes after ordering it and because I'd paid online, I still had to sign for it.  It wasn't quite still hot even though I'm only about 2.5 miles from the location and the driver did have one of those insulating bag things. A quick turn in my oven and then it was ready for eating. Decent flavor, crispy crust, enough toppings.  It was A-OK."}
{"text":"OMG these guys ROCK!!!!! They make the best pizza on the west side; don't let the corporate-ness deter you!  These guys are a great team and you can see it in their finished product; better than the bougie joints out there!  And I love picking up my order I ALWAYS have such a good time and they really make you feel like you matter, NOT SNOBBY!  Thanks for being you guys and keeping it awesomely real!"}
{"text":"Sometimes they make good pizza, like maybe 50% of the time, but sometimes they don't. Sometimes they put the flavor on the pizza crust, but more often they don't. Sometimes you get a gallon of bbq sauce on your Memphis BBQ pizza, making it more of a beverage than a food. Serious lack of consistency and lack of toppings made me change preferred pizza places."}
{"text":"Consistently saying delivered but wrong, don't call because it won't expedite anything. The food is standard though, so if you don't care about time, then you are fine. I just can't stand that online they say delivered and it takes like 30 minutes after that."}
{"text":"Very satisfied with the service dominos brings to my door! Had a very high spirited young man (Trevor) deliver my pizza. He was awesome !  Pizza order was fast and easy.  It was on time and still nice and hot! Keep it up!"}
{"text":"This is the 2 time that the charges for the order exceed the advertised price by greater than 10%.  Fair warning to all who order here.  Price padding seems to be a common mistake."}
{"text":"Crap cheap pizza, no one should be subjected to this low grade processed garbage. On top of which their delivery guys are the worst drivers north of Montréal. Dangerous for all the children in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"I love Domino's, if not for the nostalgic factor alone. If I have to choose between Pizzaville or Pizza Nova, you can bet my vote will go to Domino's. In a house full of 7 adults, it's hard to appease everyone, but due to the convenience of ordering online, and then watching your pizza be prepared, it's not always a hard sell. On our most recent order though, they goofed pretty hard. The pizzas were not made as requested, and one pizza was entirely wrong with ingredients we still have yet to figure out. (Maybe it was sausage?) This particular questionable pizza, contained ingredients that my boyfriend's brother is severely allergic to. Upon noting his tongue was itchy and taking preventative measures to ensure he didn't experience anaphylaxis, I promptly tweeted.  ...To which went unanswered for nearly 24 hours.   Then came the Facebook message, and finally the email.   Two days later, the phone rings and it's the manager of the store apologizing profusely. He then proceeds to say he'd like to offer me $100 for what had occurred to which I happily accepted. I thought this was the last of it, but when the driver arrived (they don't even deliver in our area) he opened up a pizza bag to take out a pizza and an order of cheesy bread.  \"Oh, we didn't order anything.\"  \"The manager sent it to express his apologies.\" I was stunned.   There aren't many companies out there that would go to this length to express their remorse. I truly appreciate how they handled and remedied this situation.  Unbelievable customer service."}
{"text":"Ordered pizza delivery from here on September 23, 2016.  Our pizza arrived hot and fresh in about 30 minutes which was less time than I was expecting. Also the driver was very friendly and looked professional.  I hadn't had Domino's in about 10 years because I thought their pizza was shitty and would take forever but I gave them a chance and I'm glad I did.   I got a large pizza with pineapple, ham, and jalapenos for $15.99.  It sounds terrible but trust me when I tell you it is so delicious.  Especially when you get a bite with all three ingredients in it...it's like a MOUTHGASM.  And if you wanna make it extra white trashy like me ask for some ranch dressing to dip it in.  They charge .50 cents for each little cup of dressing tho.    I like that when you order online there is a tracker that tells you the status of your pizza.  Has society gotten so uppity and demanding that they need to know the minute-by-minute status of their pizza delivery?  I'm more of a wait-an-hour-then-call-and-see-where-my-damn-pizza-is type of girl.    My husband also got 8 pieces of boneless chicken for $6.49.  They taste exactly like frozen popcorn chicken.  They're nothing special so I'd recommend getting a sauce to go with them.  They have a lot to choose from like hot sauce, sweet mango & habanero, BBQ, ranch, blue cheese, garlic butter, and marinara.    $25 bucks is kinda more than I want to spend on mass-produced pizza and frozen chicken.  I think for the price I'd rather go to Little Caesars and get the same thing for like $6 less.    Having said that I think the DXP is really cool...it's a little Chevy Spark economy car with a pizza warmer build into it.  I've never seen one in Vegas but I think the concept is pretty neat.  Maybe that's why their pizza is so garsh darn expensive...to pay for their fancy new lil' cars.  I dunno."}
{"text":"Don't order late, burned pizza and no help from manager.  We were back from a late flight and this pizza is mostly inedible."}
{"text":"Come in here for the first time and met a manager named: Chris. Let me tell you something Chris customer service is awesome! He greeted me and also fixed my order without a question ask and the most important thing is that he is super friendly and makes you feel welcome!"}
{"text":"They have always gotten my order perfect. Great deals. We used to be a pizza slut only house but they were screwing up left and right. Never thought we would be a dominos dedicated house.  I can make my own pizza but as a chef there are times I want to just eat food I didn't have to cook. This dominos always has my food hot and exactly as ordered. I'm very picky about food.  I can be a brutal critic but they deserve the praise."}
{"text":"Not only bad service, but the management team there lie.  Called twice while waiting an hour. In the end, the supervisor on shift on 3/10/17 at 8pm claimed our driver had called us. Lie!!  This is the first time I've had a problem. Still, I don't like when supervisors lie to me. Won't be ordering Dominos anymore."}
{"text":"I have not eaten Dominoes in years due to poor quality, but was in a bind this past week and did not want to wait an hour for delivery. The pizza was delivered in 20 minutes (at prime time during the week) and was delicious! Impressed and will be ordering from here again!"}
{"text":"We ordered the special $7.99 3-topping large pizza. It was awful! There were about four pieces of onion, hardly any pepperoni, and what little Italian sausage on it was burned to a crisp. There were sections of the pizza with no toppings and not much cheese. Dominos is offering these pizzas at a discount and then putting almost nothing on them. Even Little Caesars is making a much better pizza than Dominos. In fact, there are HUNDREDS of local pizza joints in the Las Vegas area which serve much, much better pizza. Only a fool would eat Dominos."}
{"text":"I knew I shouldn't have tried again but I have a bunch of gift certificates the company keeps sending me because of the screw ups. Tonight I called for a pizza at 7:49pm, the kid on the phone said he was new but got someone who he said was standing behind him to make sure he didn't mess up. They took the order and charged my credit card, they said it would take an hour. OK, so I could wait, it was snowing really heavy and I was busy so I gave them time. At the two hour mark I called and they said the driver was just at my address for a delivery, but they didnt have an order in the system for me. They tried to find the guy that took the order and they said he had clocked out and left. So all they could do was make a new pizza and send it out. I'm guessing this one won't show and I'll have to disputed the charges they put on my credit card. AND NEVER USE THEM AGAIN!"}
{"text":"It's a dominos so pizza is pretty good , customer service was not all that great , asked for a receipt and was ignored,  couldn't get my order right after  repeating myself 3 times and when asked my name she got Glenn from Dave a couple of times . Not feeling to confident about my order......."}
{"text":"Super nice and helpful! Accidentally ordered at the dominos on Decatur and Hacienda. Blue diamond store called and canceled my order and made my order for free. So awesome and pizza was perfect!"}
{"text":"They're excellent! Always fast and fresh. And sometimes they give me extra items too, lol. Couldn't ask for a better Domino's branch for delivery!"}
{"text":"This Domino's is probably the most technologically challenged of the lot (online ordering is bunged up, no debit, and credit cards...well, you'll see) but they are fast. Delivery is promised within 30-40 minutes but it's never taken more than 20. Pizza tastes acceptable but it's the cheesy breadsticks that keep me coming back.  Man, I get such a kick out of my delivery guy and our little \"routine\". It's like sketch comedy every time he comes over. My doorbell doesn't work so he has to climb over the brambles and bushes in my front yard and pound on my window to alert his arrival.   By then he's already giggling, and when I whip open the door and hand over my credit card he gets all embarrassed because not only do they not have a pre-auth system when you order, but he doesn't have a digital box OR even one of those imprint machines. He pulls out a penny and does the imprint manually using the front door for leverage.   By this point we're both crying with laughter because it's so archaic. And he just keeps repeating in between giggles \"it's so embarrassing, ma'am. So embarrassing. I'm so sorry.\"   I always look forward to my delivery days!"}
{"text":"Dominos is my go to for pizza, but this location is a well run tight ship.  The service is quick, polite, accurate and efficient.  Within 10 seconds of entering the shop I was greeted and served.  They always have a good walkin special.  As my pizza was being made, you could see the coordination in the back.  They were communicating to each other and getting orders filled.  They also have at least two delivery guys on the go.  As soon as a pizza is up, it's out the door.  A neat feature is a big screen TV showing the status of your order.    Overall, always a pleasing experience."}
{"text":"Brian, the delivery man, is absolutely phenomenal. As good as it gets! The specialty chicken is awesome!!"}
{"text":"I'm new to the area,  and have only tried this location a handful of times.  Unfortunately, on my last 2 visits there have been issues.  The previous issue was simple and not a big deal- they put the wrong kind of sauce on my chicken and had to remake it. They offered me a free soda during my wait.   The most recent visit, however, was a bit more annoying. When I showed up, my name was on the \"ready\" list, but when the guy went to go grab it, he realized only 1 of my 2 pizzas had been made. (Clearly they forgot to make it.). So I had to wait while the one pizza cooked, and the other one sat around (along with my chicken and parmesan bites).  I was offered an apology, but that was it.   I'm trying to figure out if this location has just become too busy and can't keep up, or if they haven't trained their staff very well, or if I've just happened to have bad luck the last 2 times. Regardless, there is a Papa John's a few minutes closer to my house, so I may be trying them next time."}
{"text":"Worst experience ever with pizza delivery! Ordered over $100 worth of pizza,  one of the pizza's was o ordered without cheese do to an allergy,  they made a mistake and put cheese on it, ok that happens. When I called the store the manager argued and could not find our $100 order or the notes about no cheese, finally tracked it down and promised to send the correct pizza. When the pizza arrived it was piled up in the corner of the box like the driver threw it around. Last time we call this Dominos!!!"}
{"text":"So not sure how this worked over here. Previously I've had really crappy pizza from this location on regular business days with the daily promotions. They have made the pizza very poorly or had delivery issues.   But this week (50% off pizza orders placed online) out of all weeks the staff and pizza were stellar. Maybe its because we went and picked up the pizza as carry out. Pizza came out delicious twice in a row and the staff was welcoming. We ordered a pan pizza with extra white sauce, onions and jalapeños for $5.54 after tax...pretty good. The pizza came out picture perfect.   I guess I'll have to order carryout more often."}
{"text":"Lil side stop on the road trip. It looks good.  I liked that this place had the dominoes sign on the exit plus another sign on where to turn as it got closer.  I knew i wanted pizza while driving so that was super convenient.   3 flat screens inside. Quick order at the counter and done within 10 mins.   Customer service could be better with asking which type of crusts, would you like to add a dipping sauce. I usually order delivery so I forgot about this stuff in person."}
{"text":"Zero stars and zero brains between the entire staff. It's unbelievable that we have had 5 orders in a row completely wrong. They just gave us a pizza with half nothing!! Leaky half nothing on the pizza.The Hawaiin had no Ham. The last 3 times literally they couldn't figure out how to not put peppers and onions on a Philly cheese steak. The first one the entire order was wrong. If they didn't give us a credit we wouldn't go back there. Their pizza is usually good but their employees, managers especially ,have literally the lowest level of competence of anyone on earth.This is as nice as I can  Put it too. I could be honest but yelp might remove me."}
{"text":"ordered 1 pizza with 5 ranches. waited an hour for it. this dominos is .5 miles from my house. when delivered there was NO ranch :) was forced to give the delivery guy my number & he said he would be back. 2 hours later i still don't have my ranch. called the store & the manager eric tells me MAYBE THEYRE NOT THE PIZZA PLACE FOR ME. in his exact words. pretty pathetic. one single pizza  & FIVE ranches that i paid for never recieved. didn't offer me a credit or make things right. my $23 pizza is now cold & untouched because they couldn't read the order of 1 pizza. FIVE ranch, & this isn't the first time :) gonna call corporate! thanks again"}
{"text":"Customer service is bad, specially at late hours! Maybe because they are open late and they are tired by then.  Others, the young ones were playing with pizza Dough and throwing it at each other and hitting the monitors with it."}
{"text":"Last few times for delivery,it's all good.Pizza baked right ,not under or over done ,right amount of cheese,lacking cheese on a pie that is supposed to have extra is a peeve of mine. I hope they keep it up. Update: flat out lacking in toppings I paid extra for and delivered late and cold. I'm done."}
{"text":"Placed an order for delivery over the phone.  I asked them if they were able to deliver to my address and they told me yes.  So an order was placed and was given a hour and 10min estimated delivery time.  I gave them about an hour before I called to check on the status.  Come to find out they charged me then cancelled the order.  The order was cancelled due to them not being able to deliver to my address after all.  Told the guy thanks for the phone call while I waited for the pizza.  All I was told was \"oh ya I figured someone would have called but you will get your money back in a few business days\"."}
{"text":"Today my pizza was not great. I ordered a pizza with feta cheese. When I got my pizza there was barely a trace of feta. I really had to look for it. I paid the extra cost to get the cheese and I couldn't even find it.  When I ordered the pizza online, the pizza app shows a visual representation of the toppings being added to the pizza. When you add the feta cheese it shows the cheese in chunks but when I received the pizza there was no trace of this cheese.   I brought this to the attention of the Dominoes employee when I opened the box in the store and it was like she didn't even care. I asked her why the cheese is non existent and she said the cheese is shredded. I don't even know how you can shred feta cheese since its a crumbly cheese.  When I complained, I couldn't even tell if she was listening since she was not looking at me or the pizza. I had to say \"hello are you even listening?\". She was not confident and didn't even really reassure me of the pizza toppings. She hesitated to offer a solution and so I just said I'm leaving and I'll take it up with customer service later she just allowed me to leave the store unsatisfied. I had to go home and feed my family.  This experience was so upsetting. I'll stay away from Diminoes for a long time. Not worth my time or money."}
{"text":"The pizza has been fresh and hot each time..quick delivery.  I was told about the specials on the menu..great service!!! Thanks guys"}
{"text":"I have no idea why this Domino's location has bad reviews. The staff were extremely friendly and the pizza was great. I accidentally forgot my keys there (yikes!) and they kept them safe for me until I got back. I'll order from them again if I'm in the area!"}
{"text":"They don't use gloves when making the pizza or putting the toppings on, the woman making our pizza touched the register and then made pizza"}
{"text":"Rude people, they do not get your order right,  then they have an attitude when you ask them to please check out the order before it gets sent to me.  I would not recommend them to anyone for delivery, but if you are picking up an order and can check it, you will be OK.   The food is alright, it just seems like some of the workers (Keirston) don't care."}
{"text":"First time using this Domino's location. Always use the Domino's App because ordering makes it a lot easier and also if you get 10 pizzas, you get a free pizza! Ordered our usual to see how they would compare to the other location; a cheesesteak sandwich with extra meat, a medium pizza (special if you order a medium with 2 toppings), and the Specialty Chicken with bacon and mozzarella cheese with sweet barbecue sauce. Everything we ordered was made well! Not skimping on anything. Only reason I order extra meat in the cheesesteak because I do not like onions or green peppers!Still, a great sandwich and definitely would recommend this location!"}
{"text":"I and My Family have been going to this Domino location for 3+ years.  For fast food pizza, cheesesteak sandwiches and chicken nugget specialties, really pretty good compared to other fast food pizza franchises.  But, the last 2 times, ordered cheesesteak sandwiches and barely had any meat on the sandwich. I even called and not using the app so I could tell the person taking the order about the first incident of the sandwich.  If you use the app and order 10 times, you get a free pizza.  So, list out on that too. The onion and ham hand tossed pizza still good, the chicken nugget specialty with sweet Barbeque sauce was also good. But, not with the sandwiches!"}
{"text":"Went one day and ordered a pepperoni and mushroom pizza. It's late, I'm leaving work, and tired. Open the pizza and two slices have no toppings, not even sauce or cheese. I'm two tired to wait on them to remake, so they put a credit on my account. I go back a few weeks later, and order the same pizza. This time, and I'm not sure if they were trying to be funny, or what, the pizza is so saturated with sauce that it didn't even cook all the way through. The toppings are literally sliding off the pizza as they attempt to box it. I didn't even bother with a complaint. I'm not expecting gourmet food from a Domino's, but I do expect the food to resemble a pizza that at least looks edible. Somehow they can't seem to manage that. Never again."}
{"text":"Store location smelled like a restroom. Employees need better Customer service skills. Won't be returning. If I could give zero stars I would have"}
{"text":"This location is right by our house so we hardly ever have too long to wait. Almost always perfect service. Once they didn't deliver the marinara sauce with our cheese bread. Another time we ordered for advanced delivery and they cooked it too early and left it sitting for about 20 minutes before delivering. Pizza was barely warm. Other than those 2 times (and we have them deliver frequently) it's been good."}
{"text":"Shout out to Thomas!!! Thanks for making us a oh so delicious Extravagazzzzzza Pizza! You never disappoint. I appreciate all those long hours you put in, to perfect and sculpt such a beautiful round piece we call pizza! I hope I got your name right because you deserve a shout out! The whole 15 minutes from when I walked in until you handed me my pizza you were working and giving and taking orders non stop! Kudos to you and your team! Late night dinner munchies saved by you!!!!"}
{"text":"What a joke! 2 hours now waiting for delivery.... called to ask what was up & was told that pizza was ready but all delivery drivers were out. Waited another 30 mins... called & was told that the pizza just came out of the oven & is about to go out. Then the guy got upset with us when we cancelled the order. Sucky humans, sucky business"}
{"text":"Decent food! Good price! Alright then! Why 1 star? This Dominos CANNOT include sauces that they charge for. EVER. I order food the other night, (one hour before close) get my order, tip the driver and go inside. No marinara sauce! Not a huge deal...it's only like .80 cents. Give them a call just to let them know. I only call because it's the 3-4th time it's happened. The manager was super cool and gives me a credit. Place a order tonight, spend  some money to get another item for lunch tomorrow. Get the order, check it in front of the driver and....NO SAUCE! At this point it's funny! Frustrating & funny. I love dipping my food in marinara sauce, like most humans. They charge me for it, why can't I get it? Driver didn't say a word, not even \"fuck you and your sauce\" \"sorry\". I pay for food, delivery, I tip like a decent human. What's the deal?!"}
{"text":"I placed an order late last night (1:45a) PRIOR to closing and the tracker said the order was accepted by Allison (the manager, according to the website). I was given an approximate delivery time, charged for my order and patiently awaited for a pizza that never arrived. The tracker even kept updating saying the delivery time would be less and less. Around 3:15AM, I gave up. I called this morning and was told that there were too many orders at that point and my order was canceled. 1) The tracker said my order was accepted and 2) If it was not accepted, some sort of notification could have been made so that I could have went some other place.   I understand the stress of being backed up with orders but instead of making me wait with false hopes, there should have been some sort of cancellation notification. Definitely will not be bringing my business here anymore."}
{"text":"Pizza is not bad but I think you can do it better at cutting or today someone was mad as hell"}
{"text":"I ordered and they took 30 minutes to say that they canceled my order due to a new location opening up near me. When I tried to call to resolve the issue, they ignored my call 3 times. I've ordered multiple locations at least 20 times and this is by far the worst  ever. I guess they cater to the college students (sarcasm)."}
{"text":"Cockroaches spotted May 31. I've been in theatre district restaurants and had the same thing happen. At Dominos, Richmond St.,  decided to eat  in  with friend. Reddish brown insect appeared on top of the table. Another was seen on the front bench they have in the window alcove.  Another male customer waiting for take out saw it and ignored it. Employees can hardly speak English and don't get it. They should be able to identify them on their own."}
{"text":"These guys have been feeding me for three years.  I'm a para as the result of a motorcycle accident and when I get sick I just do not feel like cooking let alone getting out of bed.  My ABSOLUTE fav pizza is a Thin crust, white sauce with chicken and spinach.  Covered in the $5.99 deal too.  I have tried Papas and a couple of other chains but no one beats this pizza and I keep coming back to Dominos.  I watch my pizza through the tracker and my dog watches the front door.  Have never waited more than 20 mins for a delivery.  Thanks to all of you who make my life a little easier and yummier!  BTW one time it was a bit overdone (like really) and they called me immediately after reading my rating on their site.  I was given credit for another one next time I ordered.  Now that is management with authority."}
{"text":"Unbelievable Zero Stars!!! I am starving so I placed a delivery order at 12 am tracked it from the oven to the double-checking for perfection  and finally to Frank leaving to deliver my order at 12:39 am and here we are more almost 2 am and NO FOOD!!! No answer on the phone and even worse my order has been deleted...It no longer exists on the Tracker!!! How upsetting terrible customer service not even a courtesy call!!! Worse Dominos location in the city."}
{"text":"Omg they changed the way they make their pizzq. They use a different kind of crust, like it has been pre made for Domino's! It was super oily and when we got home the oil was soaking the box which is yucky and makes it not a healthy kind of pizza to serve your family or yourself."}
{"text":"I love pizza, specifically Domino's. This one is close by so I ordered a pizza with half toppings, half cheese, and a philly cheese steak sandwich. First, my order came out at 12:20. It was 12:45 and wasn't out for delivery yet. I called and asked if anything was wrong. The person, who I soon found out was the manager, was extremely rude and seemed very uninterested in the situation. He said his driver would be back soon. So i asked, you're going to deliver 30-40 minute old food to me? Could you remake it? A reasonable request. He sighed deeply and was trying to convince me otherwise and then agreed. Then, the app tracker said put in oven at 12:59. It said, Out of oven and being packaged at 1:03. The driver knocked on my door at 1:03 also. So the food was shit, the service was shit, and the manager is a liar and a rude asshole. The half toppings was only on 3 slices also. Terrible quality. Terrible service."}
{"text":"Domino's Fact:  There are more than 34 million ways to create a single Domino's pizza.  I wasn't going to review a Domino's but I think this location needs a little love! Look at their ratings. Yikes.  So we stopped in after grabbing some hard ciders one night only to find ourselves ordering from a giant tablet. A short wait later, we were walking out with a piping hot pizza and some sizeable wings. I dig. Also, any pizza place that still uses cornmeal in their crust is boss in my book. As for the wings, they're pretty good. They a good size with just enough pucker.  The location is decently clean and the staff was helpful. It was a hectic St. Paddy's Day so service and food was more than fine. Are they a five star pizza place? Of course not! But comparing all the other fast food pizza joints out there, they're really not that bad. Toppings are plentiful and spread evenly, they're not overly greasy, and the price is decent. They always have specials going on so don't forget to take a peak before ordering."}
{"text":"More bad experiences than good ones. Manager offered replacement pizza but should have just asked for refund. Pizzas for this dominos are usually this bad. Little Caesars does a better job! Someone should think about opening one close!"}
{"text":"I know, I know... but trust me here....  They said 35 minutes.  It was 15.  3 pizzas and a side, 2 special orders.  They got everything right though the \"extra sauce\" was debatable.  The pizza was hot.  Actually hot.    The delivery guy was nice AND polite.    But finally - this freaking Philly Cheese-steak Pizza is freaking amazing! SOOOO good!  It's limited time only, which sucks.  But order it at least once every time they offer it.  It is so bad for me, but tastes SO good."}
{"text":"Their delivery driver's swerve around the speed bumps and could care less about on coming traffic. Very dangerous."}
{"text":"I'm not one to write reviews but after today I feel obligated to let everyone know of the terrible customer service that we received over the phone. From the moment i called I received nothing but complete rudeness from the employee. After asking for the employee's name he refused to tell me and said \"what I am asking is beyond customer service\". When speaking to the manager, I told him what happened and he did nothing about it. Stay far far away! Besides Pizza Hut is better."}
{"text":"Bad experience. I regret coming here thinking that they had decent pricing for a small pan pizza for my son."}
{"text":"We never have an issue getting pizza from this location. We usually order for delivery, and it gets here on time or early. We always get what we ordered and it's always fresh from the oven. I constantly have issues with their app and the website though, which is annoying! If they would fix the app, they'd get 5 stars."}
{"text":"I arrived to dominos to order a pizza; however, they said they were only doing delivery. So, I left and called them from the parking lot and attempted to place an order for delivery. They claimed they could not deliver to the parking lot. So, I drove across the street and then attempted to call again for delivery and they still claimed I was too close for them to deliver. When I pulled away the workers made faces and pretended to cry as if to mock my friends and I. I am super upset with both the employees' actions, as well as the lack of service I received. A company should want to make a sale, and to work with a customer; however, dominos went out of their way to make it so I could not get any food. I will never return again, and I hope this comment deters other people from providing them with business."}
{"text":"The driver actually pointed out that there is a line for a tip if I'd like to give him one as I was signing.  This huge container for chicken alfredo only about a third full with all of 3 bites of chicken in it.  Then this nasty over baked loaf of bread with cinnamon on it.  I've had Dominos before but it's never been this bad."}
{"text":"This location has always delivered my food on time and customer service has been great!  They have earned my business going forward."}
{"text":"Ordered the pizza on my phone. It said it would be ready in 10-15 minutes. Went to pick it up. Worker looked up the order on the computer and said it wasn't ready yet. Didn't get the pizza until more than 40 minutes after we ordered it! Brought it home (5 minute drive) and guess what - the pizza isn't even hot anymore!!! I'm guessing the pizza was made on time but the order wasn't updated in the system? I don't know. But either way - waiting 40 minutes for a cold pizza is totally unacceptable. I've been to other locations and this has never been a problem."}
{"text":"I love Domino's pizza because I love a good thin-crust Hawaiian pizza. However, the last 2 times I ordered my pizza from this Domino's, I have been disappointed. The first time, it was a weekend (I think a Friday) so I wasn't surprised service was slow (apparently, my pizza had been made wrong the first time, but a phone call to let me know would have been nice).  Last night, a Thursday night, is the reason for this one star review. Let me start off by saying, I am in the restaurant industry and have been for a good while, so I know that crap happens, but I also know that customer service is key.  Here is a timeline:  At 5:45pm I placed my order, and set the order time to be at 7pm-- I would get my pizza closer to 8.   At about 7:30 I checked the tracker online and it said my order was quality checked at 6:40, so I thought maybe I misunderstood, and it would be out for delivery at 7. The tracker did not show it was out for delivery, so I assumed the order was either made wrong again, or they realized the time was wrong and would hopefully be making a fresh pizza.   At 8pm, I called Domino's and asked for a status check and the young man said it wasn't out for delivery just yet. my thoughts: \"Crap, well ok, it was most likely remade\".  At 8:15, I checked and the tracker said \"Delivered\". Great! I'll get my pizza soon.-- even though Domino's is only about 10 min from my house, I expected other deliveries needed to be made.   At about 8:45 I called Domino's and hung up after being on hold for several minutes.  at 9 pm I called back and asked to speak to a manager because I STILL had not received my 1, medium, thin crust pizza. The manager asked me to hold after I told him I hadn't even received a call (like I usually do) when the driver arrived downstairs--so I knew it wasn't \"out to be delivered, and came back\". He came back to tell me the order WAS NEVER MADE. Really?? He then proceeded to ask me if I still wanted it, and that it would be about 45 minutes. I said \"Well y'all already charged my card for $18, of course I want it. I. am. Starving\".  Now even though I wanted it either comped, or a free dessert or anything to show good customer service, a respect for a very, very, very patient customer, and maybe even a little remorse, I held back on asking. I wanted to see if he would take initiative. He did not. Instead he asked me for my order and said he would expedite it, and it would be ready in 20 minutes.   At 9:45 I received the driver's call and I told her I would be right down. I went downstairs and she wasn't at or around her car. I went back upstairs thinking maybe someone let her in so she tried to find the apartment. After some wandering around and 3 unanswered phone calls later, a neighbor said she had gone to the lobby and then went back outside. I finally found her, took my pizza, and went back to my apartment.   As I told the manager on the phone, I understand things happen and computers mess up and things go wrong. I also understand that because I was a little too nice, I could have resolved the situation sooner. However, that is no excuse for the poor customer service and the obvious lack of structure and protocol.  Domino's: I don't know if your computer tracking system is automated for our sheer enjoyment, but if it is, cut the crap. I check that system assuming at each checkpoint, a team member is actually pressing a button on a progress report. If you want me to call every 10 minutes, I can do that. Trust me.  I rarely order pizza, so when I do and it gets messed up this badly, I remember. So I am not saying I will never order from you again, instead, I will make a point to order from you. And every time that online tracker shows progress, I will call and check, just to be sure. If that doesn't keep you on your toes, nothing will. Good luck."}
{"text":"If I could I would give this location 0 stars because their customer service is horrible.I called to follow up on my order and the \"manager\" Kylie was extremely rude and confrontational. She stated that her driver called and knocked on the door, this never happened. She then stated it was a waste of gas. Avoid this location at all costs."}
{"text":"The worst customer service ever!  Last night was the second time I had this experience and there will not be a third!  Save yourself and order from Papa John or Pizza Hut who do care about their customers  I ordered online 2 pizzas, garlic knots, cinnamon knots, bbq chicken bites and a 2 liter soda  First the online system crapped out at least three times, I will give the benefit of the doubt on this as it may have been week signal  The online tracker said that Kristen put the order in the oven at 7:13 and that James left to deliver at 7:32.  When the order ( 1 mile away) didn't arrive at 8:01 we called the store only to told it would arrive soon - no apologies or offer to compensate in any way. When it arrived at 8:05 everything was cold....   The first time this happened the order wasn't delivered in over an hour and I called back to cancel and ordered elsewhere. Imagine my surprise when 2 hours after I cancelled my doorbell rang and there was Dominos delivery- which we refused  After two experiences like this I will refuse to order from Domino's ever again!"}
{"text":"Ordered 3 large pizzas online. Got a call from the Manager saying that the store ran out of dough. A pizza store running out of dough on a Sunday?!? Never heard of that before."}
{"text":"Worst dominoes EVER! Ordered over an hour ago, food was finished cooking nearly 40 mins ago and it hasn't left yet"}
{"text":"Tried to order a pizza...finally gave up. My wife and I were staying in Scottsdale for a week. One night we were tired and decided to stay at the resort and order a pizza for delivery. I called this location and was immediately put on hold. After five minutes someone came on line and asked what I wanted. I told him and then there was about ten seconds of silence. He said he couldn't hear me. The reason he couldn't hear me was that two or three of his co-workers were in the background screaming and laughing. After two or three times of him asking me to repeat myself, I hung up. We went out to eat."}
{"text":"I ordered online with their new digital service. It actually has made me want to reorder again. Finally a pizza place that has embraced technology and has made it fun to wait for your pizza. You can see it to through the various stages of development.   Kudos to dominos for truly thinking outside the box!"}
{"text":"Everything was perfect! Correct, tasty and hot! Lee our delivery driver was personable, prompt and courteous!  Thank you Dominoes!"}
{"text":"I went here last month paid $27 with the 5.99 special that says online it's dine in and carry out. It's a special they have all the time. I picked up last time and asked for our military discount. And I got it. This time I call in and get the manager. She first says how they are behind on delivery. I don't need to know why your driver's dont have a car. That's your problem as a manager to pick up the slack maybe get off your but and drive your car as a manager. I still went on about my order with the 5.99 if you buy more than 2 items. At the end of all this I ask her about the military discount and she says 2 things. First we don't give military discount with other discounts. And the 2nd thing was we don't given discounts/coupons for dilivery. Really!!! I was in your location last month and got both with same type of order. I asked her to pull up my last order. She says yes it was 57 I said oh no it was not I paid 27. I have my bank statement of the day I purchased food here and she is wrong. What type of managers are working here. Really I said cancel my order I won't be needing food here any longer."}
{"text":"Took two hours for my order. Can get past the wait, but then the food was cold. The worst part is I called the store after an hour to check on my order, and was told it would be at least 30 more minutes. Told them don't mind the wait, but could they please remake it reheat my order that was sitting in the hot box. Was told ok, no problem and pizza was still cold. Don't put a tracker if you don't want us to see the progress, wait to make the food until you have a driver for it."}
{"text":"Love the domino pizza.. my first delivery place and food was always..good.. They have special discount and love to use and save loonies.."}
{"text":"We love this pizza place. In the middle of the city it always comes in a reasonable amount of time. They offer frequent coupons and specials and it's easy to use with the app for your phone.   If you get a chance order their pasta bowls as well. They are fantastic for quick pasta and a surprising change to the usual pizza.   The only thing I wish they had that they don't are side salads and family size salads as well for a more balanced meal as well as a option for the vegan/vegetarians.    Dominos doesn't as usual doesn't disappoint."}
{"text":"The service here was okay which is why I'm giving it one star but, the food was disgusting. The cheese smelt like barf and I will not order from here again. I was hoping given the awesome service and food at other locations, this one would be good as well. I was wrong. It seems as though all the pizza restaurants in this area have rotting cheese. I hope they change whatever it is that makes the cheese nasty. This is the third pizza restaurant that I've had rotting cheese from."}
{"text":"Literally, out of all the pizza joints like pizza pizza, pizza nova etc, Domino's by far has to be the best. Hot pizza, good crust, and not burnt on the bottom! Especially at this exact location, I was taking a pretty long time with my order and they were very patient and kind. They're doing everything right. Keep it up Domino's :)"}
{"text":"They have special discounts on wings on Wednesday. Not the best, but good for a grad student! :)"}
{"text":"Lousy neighborhood but, great staff and good pizza at this location. Grabbed a small cheese pizza and a 20oz after a show. Brought it back to my hotel-from-hell and shared it with my boyfriend. Definitely improved my lackluster experience on this side of Charlotte."}
{"text":"My order was good and delivered on time. I also liked the Domino's tracker online with animation."}
{"text":"Terrible customer service I ordered 2 separate orders, one on the phone and another online. When I got there to pickup my pizza they told me they had made a mistake and made my pizzas at the dominos in concord, and I had to drive 15 extra minutes to get my pizza that wasn't even hot anymore. Pizza is not good 4/10. Really disappointed and won't be coming back anytime soon"}
{"text":"Totally rip off $25 for a medium pizza yeah... My kid was the first time that he call that place  and totaly they did him really bad . The CSR SHOULD MENTION THE SPECIALS .. no selling a medium-sized pizza for almost 25 dollars.. Btw he is fourteen years old and the should be rules for that ..  Thanks dominos now we know how you do business...."}
{"text":"literally the worst customer service! everytime i try to order food they can't seem do anything right. i mean dang i understand you hate your life but let me get my food cliff. i really hope they get rid of cliff. he is the most horrendous person to deal with. wooooowwwww dominos where did you find this guy!!!"}
{"text":"Why does it take twice for an order to be redelivered and still not right! Even though you told him on the phone to take their time and make it right the second time around! Left my family hungry and unsatisfied! Proceeded to save the pizzas to take it back to them the next day was left in the lobby waiting for the on-duty supervisor to contact the manager about issuing a refund had to get you an appointment considering the time she had me waiting before they were issuing an appointment and still I never received a call back from her!"}
{"text":"I've been to this location a few dozen times over the past year and I have yet to have a bad experience. Most of the staff is very friendly and talkative especially if you are fairly regular there. Their team seems to work together well to provide good customer service. Every time I've ever been they have been busy and not just standing around staring at orders hoping the pizza fairy comes to fill them. They let you know about deals and in store coupons if they know they can save you money on stuff you order. Overall its pretty top notch for a pizza place."}
{"text":"I don't usually write reviews for chains but this Domino's was bad, even for \"fast food pizza\" standards. Way too greasy, and it was definitely stale, old grease. Ended up throwing half the pizza out because it just tasted so bad. Cheese only was edible, but anything we had with toppings was bad. Not coming back."}
{"text":"I must say the order today was quick and the pepperoni pizza was awesome ...and to top it of they do military discount ..woot woot ..thank you Dominos"}
{"text":"I just had a delivery to my house and I made specific delivery instructions to ring the doorbell because it sounds like a charm which would not wake my 4 month old baby. But instead the driver decided to ring the doorbell and bang on the door \"flat handed\" as she stated. It is hard enough to get my son to sleep but for him to be woken right back up because someone can not read simple instructions is uncalled for. I called to see if I can speak with the manager who is listed as Steve but Derrick told me he was the manager and he doesn't have time for this. Very rude service and how about learn to follow directions and none of this would have happened. My 5 year old can follow directions better. Also customer service is a very important thing and for Derrick to tell me Steve is busy and that he doesn't have time for this is a reason you guys will never get service from me again and I will be reaching out to corporate."}
{"text":"I've ordered delivery from this location 1-2 times a month for years. They've always been pretty attentive to my order and out of all those orders over the years, there may have been a misstep a time or two, but overall they've been great.  My order is pretty much the same, pan pizza with pepperoni and sausage (don't tell my cardiologist). While this location can sometimes be a little slow at times, when it's not a super busy night they are fairly prompt with my order.  Will continue to order from them in the future."}
{"text":"Ordered online, and estimated time ready was off.  Waited an extra 20 minutes past estimated time.  Pizza and wings were good, cashier was friendly.  Not bad."}
{"text":"Don't order from this place! Our order of 2 pizzas was 45 minutes late, plus one of the pizzas had hair in it.  Also, I called a was on hold for 25 minutes, when someone answered they placed me back on hold and never came back to the phone. There are other pizza places in Downtown Phoenix, so avoid this Dominos..."}
{"text":"Amazing food and super great staff.  Excited for my next order.   Don't worry about James b.   Can't please certain people in the world.   Just keep up the good work.   Thanks for being so nice and I like the new menu and fast service"}
{"text":"New deep dish pizza was alright, only in size medium, and can certainly give Pizza Hut a run for the money.  This location has an enormous seating area, friendly staff, and plenty of parking.  Nice location SE corner of Pima & Pinnacle Peak."}
{"text":"The pizza is good but I always end up on the phone with the same rude guy that never gives his name. He has a bad attitude from the second he picks up the phone and sounds extremely bored and annoyed throughout the whole phone call. I understand it's not fun working but I have worked in both food and retail and I never had a bad attitude. And then when he decides the phone call is done he says as fast as he can (while talking OVER me) \"Kay thank you bye.\" And hangs up. Also, I never complain or write reviews. But I have never had such bad customer service."}
{"text":"Dominoes... You get what you pay for so it's horrible.  Just seeing the pictures of their menu items pop up on my phone makes me sick. If you order... Good luck"}
{"text":"This location is beyond frustrating. My family has ordered from here somewhat regularly and the food is actually cooked relatively well. However, when you request garlic butter on the side they only have a 10% success rate for including it within your order. Extremely frustrating."}
{"text":"We recently ordered two XL extravaganza pizzas during their buy one get one free event (ends this Sunday, so hurry up)! I ordered the pizza online for pick up at 6:30pm. At 6:20, we got there a bit early, so the pizza wasn't ready - this was great, that means the pizza is much more fresh!  The total of the two pizzas was about $25. It wasn't bad, however just one down side is that... This pizza is suppose to be covered in toppings with extra cheese. Compared to the other dominos pizza that I go to (on hwy7), this place did not load it up!  Just out of mere convenience, I may be a reoccurring customer of this dominos."}
{"text":"Ordered a buffalo pizza and it was burnt. The cheese was black and they did not check before delivering."}
{"text":"Ok. It's no longer a secret that I order Domino's sometimes. It is, however, a secret that when you mess up my order a couple of times I might get a little too angry... and spite you on the internet.   I am here to remedy said anger, and update this location to three stars. The last two times I've ordered from here everything has been ready quickly, has been hot and cheesy and most importantly: it's exactly what I asked for.   Cheesy bread for life."}
{"text":"Called to order a pizza, was on hold for about 5 minutes,  someone answered then put me back on hold,  then call disconnected.   Called back, now  on hold for over 20 minutes...called Pullono's Pizza and ordered with them instead."}
{"text":"It took me emailing the CEO to get anything done but the district manager did contact us and gave us gift cards as well as an apology, it was appreciated and I wanted to note it here."}
{"text":"I have placed orders for delivery from this particular Domino's on quite a few occasions. They are my \"go to\" pizza place! I have always been very satisfied with their pizzas and I am also a fan of their brownies and cinnamon bread twists with the icing. Delivery has always been very fast and the food arrives hot and the drivers have been professional. I love ordering online because you can get a free pizza after so many orders... when you do redeem for the free pizza, just make sure you check your final order to make sure it was marked as no cost.  I have been impressed with how the quality of Domino's pizzas have improved compared to the many, many years ago that we used to order them in college (they certainly were not as tasty as they are these days). I have also done carryout at this particular Domino's and the place has always been clean and staff were friendly enough. I guess if I had to offer any suggestions to corporate Domino's, it would be to offer a garlic dipping sauce that actually had butter in it... this stuff is just oil and the sweet icing dip is not much better nutritionally. But other than that, the food has been good."}
{"text":"This location is awesome. They fulfill every request that I have. If there is a mistake they fix it. This is in fact the best Domino's location in the city of Charlotte"}
{"text":"They screwed up my pizza for the 2nd time! I complained about the 1st time it wasn't right, so they offered me 2-complimentary pizzas, so I assumed when I called to place the order it would be correct this time. I was wrong, once again, one of my pizzas had barely any cheese, when I specifically asked for DOUBLE cheese. So I learned to not ever order delivery again. You get what you pay for, and since I didn't pay full price for my 2nd order, they made sure to mess it up...again. So like a dummy I ordered from then again tonight, and once again, one pizza was perfect, and the other one was not even close. I ordered 2 identical pizzas, so they both should look exactly alike. WRONG, one had the double cheese, and the other has slices with cheese missing. Not even extra cheese, but regular amount of cheese. 3 strikes you're out! This Domino's is now the worst."}
{"text":"The pizza was never delivered! After 45 minutes (an hour and a half after the pizza was done) I called asking for an update, the guy was polite and told me that they were short staffed and it would be there soon. Thirty minutes later I called and again was told me it was busy and they were short on drivers and would be here soon. After over 2 hours, I called a 3rd time and was told my order was canceled. I kept being told that it was my fault: I didn't give them a gate code (our neighborhood doesn't have gate codes you need to select the name from the list) and my number is not in service (I called three times and have received other calls today, so its in service). I was tired of being blamed when I had already called them twice and they could have addressed this prior and done so by not blaming me for something I did not do. I asked to speak with the manager and it turns out the person putting the blame on me was the manager, who proceeded to hang up on me. Seeing as I order from Dominos frequently and never have an issue, this is extremely upsetting. I called a different pizza chain across the street from me 5 mins before they closed and they were able to make my pizza and even gave me a discount because I had to wait about 3 minutes while they fixed the toppings. I would highly request that something be done about the management at this location because it's costing the company customers."}
{"text":"Never had any issues here, I usually order about once a month, maybe twice at the most.  Pizza is always fresh and tastes fine.  Customer service and staff have been good.  I order online, so it makes it easy for me to pick up and go without a hassle!"}
{"text":"This was one of the most disgusting deliveries I've ever received. I've ordered from Domino's three times with friends recently, and my previous two experiences were positive.  Today, the estimate was 35 minutes -- it took an hour. No apology or excuse given even when I inquired. XL Brooklyn/NY style pizza ordered -- somewhat undercooked, but moreover it was the sloppiest pizza I've ever had delivered to me. It is an enormous pizza that was cut into only SIX very VERY uneven pieces and not even cut all the way to the center. Cheesy bread -- seriously undercooked to the point that it is inedible. 30-40% of the cheesy bread order was raw dough.   I am DISGUSTED and STILL HUNGRY. Looking for a full refund or a voucher for a duplicate order from a DIFFERENT STORE. Unacceptable."}
{"text":"Late driver, almost raw chicken.   We always tipped even though we live very close to the location. (One delivery driver gave himself an $8 tip!)   Tonight the guy took 30 minutes (ok, it's Friday) and with almost inedible food, we won't be ordering from them again, sadly."}
{"text":"Horrible service first they get the order next they take over an hour to deliver so in other words we got cold pizza smh bad service"}
{"text":"Great service.  Pizza was awesome - super speedy delivery and very affordable!"}
{"text":"The pizza was warm at best when it finally arrived at my location at which point I received a phone call asking me if I could come and get my pizza because he was here.  I thought delivery meant to your door.  I choose delivery when I'm not planning to go out!!!  Needless to say he got an earful for not bringing it down the steps, $0 tip and I will not be ordering from this location again!"}
{"text":"Ordered here once and they did my order correctly, however, this time they did my order incorrectly despite me calling to clarify and I was lied to on the phone. Afterwords, I called them at least 4 times with no answer and then the 4th time I got answered then put on hold with no answer after 4 minutes. I was simply going to ask them if they could redo my pizza. I ended up not eating it- money wasted. I will never order from here again."}
{"text":"Delivery drivers are very quick and pleasant. This place is good at compensating in case they mess up. And the pizza is always top quality."}
{"text":"Uhh I don't know what to write because the food was delicious and the waiter was kind but the service was really sloooooooooooooooooooioooooow"}
{"text":"Order is always accurate, yummy and fast. Best Domino's location anywhere!"}
{"text":"Dumb like all dominos. Papa johns is better like why the friction does it take so long to melt cheese on some dough...get it together nerds!!!!"}
{"text":"NO CUSTOMER SERVICE at DOMINO's...Don't trust that this Domino's will give you the best deals!!!!  My daughter called and asked what the deals were and they failed to tell her about the $5.99 special. They up sold her on spending 3x on another deal. When I called the GM (Tyler Tucci) his position was \"we don't have time to tell people all the deals that we are offering\" and insisted that was the best deal. When I voiced a concern about the lack of customer service, he hung up on me. Barro's here I come!!!"}
{"text":"If you want great customer service and a pizza in under 2 hours dont order from Dominos!!! Placed an order online to make the process a bit quicker. No problem there.... Received my order via email that all was good and due to deliver under 45 min. Great! Then time passes and I notice that the pizza was out of the oven and sitting for over an hour. When I called they said it was just coming out of the oven and would leave the store in under 5 minutes.... More time passes by and the pizza didnt hit my door until 1 hour 27 minutes total. I called back to speak to a manager and the lady was completely RUDE. Said \"Sorry ...wish there was something we could do. ummm... \"  So I mentioned that their website is giving false information to clients... she said \"Ya.. but there is nothing we can do.\" So i then told her we would not be ordering from dominos anymore. She said ok and sorry again. What is WRONG with this? ZERO cares given, ZERO effort to retain a customer, and being helpful would be asking too much of this person. Sorry Dominos... I've given you too many chances. Pizza Hut at least knows how to speak to a customer."}
{"text":"This review is just for the service. 2 times out of two times they messed up my order . what the odds?!. There has to be something wrong because both times they were different cashiers . If I go to Donibo's over something else is just for the fast time in making the food. If I have to wait for them to remake my order it totally defeats the purpose and I rather eat something else. Managers of this location should do something about it."}
{"text":"Got a free pizza because they messed up my last order. Still ended up paying a few bucks for it and my pizza looks old, was 20 minutes late, and has no seasoning on the crust."}
{"text":"Dominos.  In college it was the first place to offer free delivery promised fast and friendly.  It was a boon to the 70's generation not the on have to wait an hour for real pizzeria pizza that charged delivery when all you really needed was a quick munch pie.  It became the standard as many other chains joined in and during the 80's we were told to \"avoid the Noid\" and buy Domino's.  Then the pizza started getting really lame, the staff no longer friendly and the deliver not fast.  We went elsewhere and considered it a sign of the times.  We turned to some great local pizza joints for carry out but missed delivery (unless we broke down and ordered from that punk Papa John).  Then they turned things around and then pizza was delivered fast and friendly again AND the bonus is it tastes good again. The munch pie is back."}
{"text":"Been waiting for my delivery for 50 minutes now. I live 8 minutes from the location and tried calling and haven't been able to get through to the store. Avoid this store at all costs."}
{"text":"Fast delivery. Great quality.  Good customer service. Definitely will be ordering again! Yum!"}
{"text":"This place has, by far, THEE WORST customer service EVER! I'm a Motel 6 employee and my staff and i always ordered from Dominos with no issues. We get their menus delivered to us so we would send them lots of business as well. NEVER AGAIN! My coworker and i called in an order for delivery. She ordered a Philly cheese sandwich and i ordered an Alfredo pasta but i don't eat meat so i subbed my chicken for mushrooms. The delivery driver came with the food. He seemed to be a very nice guy. He mentioned that i should check the food to make sure it was right before he left in case they needed him to go back or anything. Almost as if he knew it wasn't right but he said they don't allow him to open the food. So i checked it. First thing wrong: my mushrooms were missing. Second: my co-workers cheese on her sub was so burned it was black and hard. Third: my pasta was extremely overcooked and was hard and struck to the foil pan it was in. It was only loose and creamy in the center.  So we tried giving them a chance to rectify the situation. We called back to speak with a manager. He was the rudest person I've ever dealt with. He bluntly told us we were lying about the delivery driver telling us to check the food because \"my driver has no way of knowing you asked for mushrooms,\" he bluntly refused to replace the food, and said he was gonna send the driver back to give the money back. My coworker was so pissed! I said, let me call back and try to explain. So i did. I told him we send them lots of business, explained that the driver was nice, and just tried to let him know we were hungry and didn't want our money back, just food that tastes right...  I got the same asshole reaction out of him. So a few minutes later the driver walks back in the lobby, rudely slams the money on the counter top, and before we could tell him we meant no harm, he storms out of the door.  I don't know what his issue was but if he was gonna act like that he could have returned his tip too! Needless to say, we will NEVER order from here again and every menu that comes to this property will go directly in the trash. My entire team has an understanding..no more business for them from anyone of our employees... Or guests if we can help it. (Speaking of, a guest came to the front TODAY saying he ordered food that was never delivered. What a sorry staff.) Dominos, you have a great business and a host of fine establishments. This is not one of them. That manager there gives you all a horrible face for the company."}
{"text":"I went here the other day (9/26/15) and ordered online.  I had a Brooklyn style large pepperoni and a medium pan pepperoni.  The Brooklyn was very sad. To me it just seemed like a thin crust pizza with larger slices.  The taste was okay.  The Medium Pan was pretty good, nice and thick.  Overall though its just your average pizza.  The problem is not this location specifically but Domino's as a whole.  Step up your wing game because I will never order wings from dominos again.  Didn't order this time and never will but their wings are weak.  Take brooklyn style off your menu as its just false advertisement and last but not least.   What's up with trying to charge for red crush pepper?  That is absurd.  Charging for red crush pepper is just corporate greed to me so I will just get pizza elsewhere.    I do want to emphasize, nothing was wrong about this location, it is only dominos as a corporation.  This location got my order correct and in a timely manner."}
{"text":"it's cheap but it's also ghetto as hell too. may as well save up an extra dollar or so and go to a nearby local pizzeria who sells slices relatively cheap."}
{"text":"I loved Domino's after they made changes to their pizza about a year a go. Fyi.. Papa John's sucks!!. Not sure what happened to the Jones Blvd location in the past 2 months.. new management/ employees/ or being told from corporate to cut backs on the amounts of toppings, BUT I WILL NEVER ORDER FROM DOMINO'S AGAIN!!!!!  The pizza about 2 months ago was perfect. Hot, golden brown, crispy crust, dripping with cheese and toppings. The last and final time that I ordered 2 days ago. One pizza was raw. The dough tasted raw and the pizza was not even warm. I decided to give them one more chance 2 days ago and the pizza I that was delivered BARELY HAD ANY SAUCE, TOPPINGS, OR CHEESE. I COULD HAVE WENT TO THE MARKET AND PICKED UP A DIGOURNO PIZZA!!!! IT WAS NOT WORTH $16.00.. IT WAS ALL BREAD!! I gave you 2 more chances Dominos and you officially suck worse than Papa John's!!!!!!. And the girl answering the phones sounds like she just had a bad attitude or really hates her job!!!!. NOT MY FREAKING FAULT!! FIND ANOTHER ONE!!. The only good thing is that the delivery drivers have always been pleasant and the little blonde guy 2 days ago was very polite, professional, and had a big smile. That's why I gave him all of the change from paying for the pizza even though the food was horrible. Hey Corporate!! How about you figure out what happened to this location. It seems like they checked out."}
{"text":"Great customer service, manager and delivery guy. I order soda with my pizza but they forgot the soda so they had to go back to the store to get it but I called to just asked them to refund my credit card for the price of soda but the manager offered to refund the whole order and then the deliver guy came back with my soda which I think he just went to the 7-Eleven to get it for me. Great customer service and I never had bad experience with this location."}
{"text":"I called to tell them that they shorted me the marinara, that comes with the garlic twists.  The \"manager\" who answered the phone said \"there are many choices in pizza places and I should choose a different one\"."}
{"text":"I usually come here for the specials. Looks like they recently remodeled the inside waiting area. I haven't had my order 'mucked up' like I've experienced at other pizza joints. I guess I should expect an extended wait time on the weekends."}
{"text":"Ordered at 2:30 am and the food was out by 2:43 AM. I was sitting in my car and the nice friendly agent brought the food to me.  the food was delicious and the service was nice and friendly"}
{"text":"I would give negative stars if I could.  The phone has been ringing unanswered for the entire 1 hour and 17 minutes I have been waiting for my order that was supposed to take 20 min, still don't have it as I type this review.  Staff seems unapologetic and I'm late for a client meeting now.  Never ever again will I deal with this place and my office is down the street.    I'm not exaggerating when I say there are close to 10 people all waiting"}
{"text":"Good pizza but needed more sauce. Was tasty but as anything extra was extra will visit other pizza places that don't charge extra for things light sauce and ranch"}
{"text":"Our local Domino's is very good. Domino's as a company has stepped up their game all around. Great specials, and quality take out pizza!"}
{"text":"This Dominoes Pizza delivers extremely fast! I ordered a pizza online today and they emailed me saying the pizza will arrive within 29-39 minutes but the delivery man showed up on my doorsteps within 20 minutes! I've never had anything delivered this fast before. I'm definitely impressed and will for sure order from here again. They even got my order right and did not forget any of the dipping sauces."}
{"text":"Not pleased AT ALL. I received an email saying the order would be delivered in 15-20 minutes. It's 3:31am (well past the order time) and not only have I NOT received my order but the store has decided not to answer their phone. Funny thing how you'll send over a confirmation email but you won't deliver the pizza. You lost my business."}
{"text":"I have ordered from this Domino's several times. It seems over the past few months they have gone way down... Tonight I ordered a large pizza and wings. It took an hour and 15 minutes to get here. The delivery guy handed me 2 boxes, which I sadly assumed was my chicken and my pizza. No, it was 2 nearly burned, cold, half pizzas. I called and spoke to the manager, who was short and not very apologetic. She did explain why the pizza was in two boxes, but it would have been nice if the delivery guy was informed as to why it was in two boxes so I could have clearly seen my chicken was missing. Every time they screw something up, they say the next time I order, I will get it free. I don't and never have. This is the third order they have screwed up, the last three times I have ordered from there. Domino's isn't that great to keep dealing with this. From now on, we will be headed back to Marco's or some other pizza place in the area. Adios, Domino's!"}
{"text":"Ordered using iPhone app. Store has excellent and quick delivery, even on typically busy nights. Took advantage of 3 md pizzas for $5.55 ea, add on toppings are not a great value, and while delivery is less than Pizza Hut, it still sucks that they charge all orders an extra $1.99 on top of tax. Pizzas were delivered super hot in about 25 minutes. Everything was made correctly and tasted good. Will definitely get pizza from there again!"}
{"text":"This place is so bad in delivery. I ordered on A Friday at 415p. At 432p their tracker said my pizza was on my way. At 515pm I called the store and asked what was happening?, the said it is taking 1 hr and 30 minutes for a pizza to reach me a mile away. We ordered early because we had to leave at 530pm for an engagement. They charge $2.93 for delivery a mile away . No more Dominos"}
{"text":"Shitty pizza place. Messed up orders all the time. I do not recommend this place."}
{"text":"This one is not quite as good as Dominos normally is. The pizza tasted like the dough was old and had a cleaning chemical taste to it. Definitely a last resort for pizza."}
{"text":"I like Domino's.  Their prices are fair and you can custom build an order right online.  Every time I've done this, the pizza has been prepared perfectly.  I usually pick it up and the staff has always been polite and professional.  Today for a little something special, I ordered the CHOCOLATE LAVA CRUNCH CAKES - OMG, so yummy but I'm sure I'll have a sugar crash later.  That's ok, it was worth it.  Thank you for a job well done!"}
{"text":"Ok, so I've never been a fan of Domino's in the past and I can't say much has changed since they said they had redone their recipe for a \"better\" pizza. The crust is just too overly seasoned. That really turns me off. It tastes like they put way too much garlic powder combined with Mrs. Dash on it, ew.  The texture is ok, but it's really not doing it for me. I prefer Pizza Hut or Papa John's still if I'm going for a cheap pizza on the quick."}
{"text":"Worst Dominos EVER. If all Dominos were run like this it would be out of business in a week. Ordered a pizza and ONE HOUR LATER they call me to say they don't have change for $100 - even though I ALREADY PAID FOR IT ON A CREDIT CARD. Never doing business with Dominos again after this disappointing experience. If you are in Vegas and want pizza I suggest Metro Pizza instead - at least when you pay for a pizza they actually bring it"}
{"text":"I must say that dominos has stepped up their game! Just picked up two pizzas. Pepperoni sausage and jalapeños was the bomb! Great flavor all around. No skimping on the jalapeños either!"}
{"text":"To start, you know if you're going to Dominos that you're not expecting amazing pizza. You're just expecting to get pizza that reminds you of being a kid.....nostalgically delivered to your doorstep. The pizza is edible and it's quite like riding a moped (fun unless you get caught by your foodie-friends). I must say though, even with such low expectations of the food....the customer service at this location is downright TRAGIC!  I was actually told when I telephoned about my pizza being exceptionally late \"we don't want you as a customer anyways\". I wouldn't put my hard earned cash here....Who wants mediocre food AND crappy customer service?"}
{"text":"This location always does a  great job with getting my order right. There has been a couple times though where the ETA said a half hour and it's taken an hour. That gets annoying. But overall excellent job!"}
{"text":"Ordered pizza last night and they told me that it will be there within 40. It was there in 20 mins. I was impressed by the delivery time. Of course the pizza was good as always with dominos. The chicken bites were good too."}
{"text":"FAST service, order nade perfect and HOT!!   Good store and nice team members."}
{"text":"Dominos has been much better in recent years. Prices, like at all pizza parlors, could be better but the food is well made and good quality. Delivery time is reasonable and the online order tracker is useful for us impatient types."}
{"text":"If you are ordering from Domino's then you are hankering for that special, simple taste of frozen pizza assembled quickly by teenagers. No fuss, no muss. Not a bad time and never a great time. It is Domino's. End of story."}
{"text":"Usually quick and good. Got a free pizza from all my point earned on delivery. Dough was nearly raw, extra toppings were sparse, was like a wet uncooked deep dish. Bummed. But usually pretty good just can't believe I picked this day to pick free pizza for friends and most chose \"no thanks\""}
{"text":"Awesome Domino's. I always use the app and the order is perfect every time. Delivered quickly by friendly staff. This is always my go-to for pizza."}
{"text":"If I could give them no stars I would. I walked in and was waiting to order my pizza when I see them cleaning the air vents with a dusty broom right over where they make the pizzas. Gross!! Walked out right then and there."}
{"text":"We have used this particular Domino's Pizza location for many years as it is close to our home. I am compelled to review them at this time due to numerous mistakes on orders, delayed deliver time and less than stellar customer service. They have forgotten to bring our beverages, dropped our pizzas on the floor, taken greater than 30 minutes to deliver pizza (we live less than one mile away) and never have we received notification, apologies  about delays, mistakes on orders or any adequate compensation for poor customer service. Last weekend our pizzas had been out for delivery (you can check through their website the status of orders) more than 30 minutes, when the pizzas arrived, they were not in a heat saving container, the boxes were greasy and the driver did not explain or apologize for the delay (we always tip our drivers 30% or more, we are gracious customers) I called the store immediately, explained the situation, there was an uncomfortable silence which I had to then speak up and ask for compensation. My request was replied to with \"if you want your pizzas replaced it will take more than two hours.....\" I stated that we didn't want to wait that long. Silence again. I asked to be refunded for my order then and asked for the name of the person I was speaking with. \"Fine we will give you your money back\" he almost hung up abruptly. I asked his name again and he replied. I have yet to be refunded, but I have been charged.  I will be making a call to a Higher Power so to speak, which is time consuming and pain staking in some instances. After being a customer for over 10 years I will never order again."}
{"text":"Third issue, you're out Domino's! Came to pick up on time, waited 10 mins just so they could tell me they forgot to put an item in the oven. Then I waited almost 20 minutes... If there is a strong argument against raising the minimum wage, it's embodied in the crew here. The other items I ordered were not even fired up again, they were cold and soggy. I'd give it 2 stars if it wasn't the 3rd strike."}
{"text":"Ordered triple cheese, and pepperoni.  I don't know if they just didn't bother to give me the triple cheese I paid for, or if their idea of triple cheese is MUCH different than my own, but there was just the normal amount of cheese on my za, and a pitiful amount of pepperoni.  It just wasn't very good.  Sauce is weird.  Blech.  Won't be ordering from them again."}
{"text":"Pizzas are always great...however the last few times the sandwiches have not been so great.  But drivers are always pleasant...and this place is fast...!!"}
{"text":"I ordered delivery pizza and chicken. My wait time was 20-30 minutes. My order didn't actually arrive until 80 minutes and had clearly been sitting out a while. Both the chicken and pizza were cold. When I called to ask where my order was before it got there, I was told the driver just left. Then they proceeded to tell me my order came out of the oven about 10 minutes ago. So basically telling me the food had just been sitting around. I won't order from here again and wouldn't recommend it- at least for delivery."}
{"text":"Worst pizza ever, I don't know what is in the sauce,  but it was funky tasting. Huge disappointment because the  pizza LOOKED good, however was horrible.  Sorry Dominoes,  but it sucked!!!"}
{"text":"If only 0 stars were a choice. This place is horrific. Not worth the aggravation.  Our experience was so absurd that I wouldn't believe it, except I experienced it first hand. And the food it terrible. Disgusting. Absolutely disgusting."}
{"text":"I can't imagine a worse phone order experience.  I officially will NEVER again order from Dominos.  Travis who answered the phone was pretty much mumbling the entire time and apparently never trained, \"attempted\" to take my order for 4 large specialty pizzas for my mgmt meeting at work. He ultimately asked, \"cash or charge\" which I responded \"cash\" and then received no response. I sat for 5 more minutes listening to a mumbled conversation until he hung-up on me.  After 50 minutes of waiting, I called back and spoke to the same clueless employee who told me \"the pizzas show here they're being delivered so they'll be there in 5 minutes.\"  Then after another 15 minutes, I called back and told Travis to give me a manager. The person who picked up the phone was even less professional and so obviously not a manager, I swear it was as if the same guy was just pretending to sound like somebody else! So whoever it was proceeded to tell me my order was never placed and no food is being delivered!  No apology and no care whatsoever on his part. This was for a work event and I was thoroughly embarrassed to inform an already frustrated and hungry group that our waiting will not be rewarded and we have to start over somewhere else. So I will now do everything I can to ensure no one else from our company and anyone else that ever brings up Dominos, to NEVER order from them.  What a horribly run establishment."}
