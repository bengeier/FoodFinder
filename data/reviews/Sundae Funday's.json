{"text":"This place is great!  Very good, freshly made sandwiches at a reasonable price.  This park is becoming a favorite of mine.  Great walking paths and just an overall nice vibe here that makes you not want to leave!"}
{"text":"The pizza is ok . Takes a while to make the order . The ice cream scoops seem a bit overpriced. The overall idea of taking a nice walk and sitting for root float is nice"}

{"text":"What an awesome spot! We went Tuesday night. They have mini golf, ice cream, pizza and are near the Metroparks. I had a smores parfait which was absolutely delicious. My husband ordered a chocolate marshmallow milkshake that was also good. We also got a cheesy bread to go and that was good too. Fresh dough, cheese, etc."}
