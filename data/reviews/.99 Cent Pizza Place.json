{"text":"After school I wanted to find somewhere that was cheap and fast so I could go to work right away this pizza was amazing I expected gross cheap pizza but everytime I go Im never disappointed this is my pizza place!!"}
{"text":"Having grown up in Chicago and being diabolicaly opposed to NY crust, I'm pretty much a pizza snob. Having said that... Great, hand tossed (not NY) crust, cooked to that perfect blend of crisp yet chewy. I had sausage and mushrooms. Both were fresh, not outta a can and very tasty. Also, good mix of cheese and a little bit of grease left on the plate, YUM!  DON'T Think you can beat this for a $5 lunch.  Stop in, let's keep the local guys busy."}
{"text":"I've eaten here a couple of times, today was not one of the good days.  The crust was soggy--should be crisp and the wings were very soggy--not appetizing at all.  I think it depends on who's in the kitchen on the day you go--they should try to make it more uniform so that it's the same every time you order or get rid of the person who made it today"}
{"text":"I saw this place when I was leaving the bank, and for .99c a slice I was expecting a small slice so I ordered 2...but these are big slices and they were very good. You can get the 18\" for $7-8 depending on if you want a topping or not."}
{"text":"This is some good pizza, and for the price you can't beat it. I compare every pizza place to the ones in Chicago. I look forward to sampling more of the menu. Fast service with great pizza!  I went back yesterday for a couple of slices and I think price has gone up. I doesn't matter to me, it's still really good pizza. The sausage is excellent. The service here is quick and the pizza is hot, fresh, and damn tasty."}
{"text":"A local pizza place in an old Pizza Hut pick-up/delivery location...  5 for the speed...3 for the wing sauce...1 for steamed, not fried wings...  3 is what I can give this location based on my first visit.  I will have to revisit when I am in a pizza kind of mood."}
{"text":"Okay, now we're talking.  I thought I had the pizza deal of the Valley when I discovered Jimmy & Joes, but then I found this place.  I don't know how to react other than to say _wow_.  Here's how it goes:  --A slice of cheese pizza is 99 cents (additional toppings are $0.25 each, custom made). --Two slices of cheese pizza and a can of soda is $2.75. --A WHOLE 18-inch pie is EIGHT DOLLARS PLUS TAX, with additional toppings for $1.25 each. --Calzones, $5 each. --A dozen garlic bread \"knots\" with marinara for $5.  And they deliver too.  Cash only.  No cards--this keeps prices down.  And just in case you're thinking, \"Oh, for that price it must be shit pizza, right?\"  No.  This is actually REALLY GOOD pizza with fresh ingredients and a delicious crust.  Forget the chains with their high overhead and corporate profit margins.  Here's your chance to support an independent local business that provides the community with a great product.  The owner is a really friendly, approachable guy that honestly wants to give people a good pizza at a good price--and he succeeds (thanks Jimmy!).  The next time you're tempted to go to a festering conglomerate to satisfy your pizza fix, remember that right here in your neighborhood is a cheaper, less glitzy alternative.  There's no beer, no salad bar, and no gluten-free option--just the stripped-down basics, and it rocks.  Go here.  Spread the word.  Even my daughter likes this place and she doesn't even like pizza!  99 Cent Pizza Place--give this man your business!"}
