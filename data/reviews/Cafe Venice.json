{"text":"Have dined here a couple of times, inside and outside. Very good food and friendly service.  I have enjoyed the food each time and with plenty for the doggy bag. Price is good for the value.BYOB is the status."}
{"text":"Bad food. Worse service.  Will not be returning. Waitress was rude, I felt like I was on the soup natzi episode of Seinfeld.  Food was obviously frozen factory processed. Nothing authentic about it."}
{"text":"This spot is less than a mile from my house so it's a place I've eaten at on several occasions. The best part of this restaurant is its mom and pop vibe. This place is authentic as they come and is owned by an older Italian gentleman who frequently sits and talks with dining guests. The bruschetta is out of this world and the best I've ever had. Other dishes here are also good eats, but nothing to write home about. Their prices are a little high, but the large portions and charm of the place help make up for it."}
{"text":"I love this place it sits right on Mt. Royal Blvd., and they have nice outside dining!  I love there cafe mocha drinks, its a nice place for a good Italian meal or if you just want to go some where and have a cup of coffee and dessert.  If you sit outside while you dine you can bring your dog, that's something I love to do"}
{"text":"TERRIBLE SERVICE. And fruit flies everywhere. Worst I've ever had, and I've had some bad experiences! We called to see if they could fit our party of 6 and instead of telling us they were understaffed, they took the reservation. We sat inside and were not greeted not was our drink order taken for over 20 minutes. It took 15 more to get the drinks and then they took our order. We then sat there for an hour and a half. NO APOLOGY OR EXPLANATION. They brought out two people's food, and never came back. I went to ask what was going on and everyone was just standing around! Again, no explanation or apology. They were serving customers who were sitting outside that arrived an hour after we did, and they didn't even discount the few morsels of food we did get! Terrible terrible terrible. It was my second time there, the first wasn't this bad, but I will never ever go back. Being understaffed is one thing, being rude and ignoring your customers is horrible. Don't go there if you actually want to eat within 2 hours or if you expect good service."}
{"text":"I enjoyed this place. I got their pasta Della Casa with bacon and also tried some of the manicotti. Nothing above average, but the waitstaff was fun, helpful and attentive. Enjoyed the garlic knots as well. All in all, semi-authentic and not a disappointment. I won't ask for or expect more for the price."}
