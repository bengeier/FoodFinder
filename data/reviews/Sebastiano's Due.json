{"text":"I was really disappointed with my latest visit to Sebastiano's Due.  I've been to the Mooresville location, and their service is so much better.  While the pizza was really good, I just cannot recommend dining in at this location - carryout or delivery is the only way to go with this business!

We were seated in a spartan dining room with virtually no appeal.  It was not welcoming in the least.  They also played country music - not my favorite.  

Our waitress was one of the worst I have ever had.  Not only did she smell STRONGLY of smoke (like that's the only thing she did while working), but she was inattentive and indifferent to both us and her only other table.  While the other waitress frequently checked on her tables to make sure their drinks were full and the customers did not need anything, we had to go into the front (bar) area TWICE to get our waitress's attention for something.  Like I said, this was the worst service ever.

The pizza, well, I have to admit it's really good.  The prices are good, too.  I recall loving the pasta from the Mooresville location and will likely try it here...but ONLY via delivery."}
