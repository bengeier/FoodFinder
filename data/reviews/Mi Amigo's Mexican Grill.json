{"text":"Staying as airline crew at the Sheraton hotel across the street, I asked the front desk person to recommend me a good Mexican restaurant.  He recommended the \"Canyon Café\" which is in the same exact mall/movie complex as this place, \"Mi Amigo's \" .  I reviewed the Canyon Café's menu and didn't care for it since it's more of a Fusion restaurant, not real Mexican food.  I told the hostess that I wanted more authentic food and she told me to try \"Mi Amigo's\" . I walked 100 feet to this place.  I have to say the server was a sweetheart...very friendly, welcoming - THAT's the ONLY thing I liked about this place, aside from the Cadillac Margarita for $5.75.  I ordered the tortilla soup.  OKish; free chips and salsa - the chips were awesome, the salsa mediocre.  The worst disappointment was my main course - I ordered the Red Beef Tamales.  These are the worst tamales that I remember eating.  I can make them better myself at home!! And I am an awful cook!  I was joined by one of our flight attendants and he joined me at my table.  He pretty much reached the same concensus as I.  Sorry, but I really, really was looking forward to a nice, hot tasty Mexican meal.  I was in Arizona for crying out loud, not in North Dakota or Maine, where Mexican food may not be as widespread.   PLEASE get your menu and most importantly your ingredients in order!  My colleagues at my airline stay across the street at the Sheraton and would appreciate a nice Mexican meal on our work trips.   Thanks !!"}
{"text":"The food is quite mediocre with nothing to chat about. I had the carne asada burrito which in all honesty didn't taste lake a burrito. The flavor was bland with to much refried beans with little to no meat at all. Left full but not satisfied, probably the worst combo."}
{"text":"I can understand some of the reviews on here about this place.  First, the service was ok.  Not great.  Not bad.  Just ok.  I ordered the Chicken Rolled Tacos because they don't have Flautas on the dinner menu.  I told the waiter that I didn't want beans, I just wanted more rice.  My order came out....and you can guess...there were beans!  And...of course with all Mexican Restaurants - the rice was on top of the beans.  Yuck!  I liked the rolled tacos, but they were not too special.  All in all, the food was average and the service is below average."}
{"text":"My husband worked there a few years ago. He witnessed several health code violations. And the staff is not especially fair nor friendly to co-workers who 'no habla espanol'. Good riddence!"}
{"text":"We had excellent service for our large party. There was always new chips and salsa when we ran out and drinks we refilled before we even ran out! Rarely does that happen anywhere. The food was pretty good and all of our orders were correct. We even had a birthday in our group and they sang and brought our table an order of dessert. I would definitely go back to Mi Amigo's."}
{"text":"This is one of our favorite places. The service is fast. The blue margaritas are great and inexpensive. The food is really good. The décor is great. The tables are always clean and so is the restaurant. The chili rellenos are fantastic. My son had the chimichanga and it great. The chips were hot and fresh and the bean dip for 25 cents was very good. Probably the most consistent and one of our favorite Mexican restaurants. We like Dos Gringos but it is pretty dirty. Our waiter was also really great."}
{"text":"It was my fist time coming here. I ordered the Shrimp Cocktail it was really Good. I also ordered the lunch special a Chicken Chimi,rice and Beans it was OK. My son ordered the Carnitas Burrito,Fries and Beans it was OK. The Salsa and Chips were pretty good. Overall experience was Ok"}
{"text":"This place was gross! Americanized Mexican food  Too greasy  Rice had a bland taste and beans taste canned Oh and one shot of tequila was 6.50! 6.50! Def not worth it  Over priced and gross  One star for good salsa  Went there for a big birthday dinner about 25 ppl total  Service was ok  Would not recommend or return"}
{"text":"Ruined my sons birthday. Dirty silverware and glasses. Got our orders wrong, food took over an hour to come out, we ordered dessert they delivered in to go boxes and then we get out to the car to find out they split one order of sopapillas  into two boxes but charged for two. Rude waitress and even ruder manager. Worst dinning experience I have had in my whole life. Never coming back."}
{"text":"Went here for dinner on Friday night. We loved it!! Everytime we are in town we visit Mi Amigos! I wish LA had mexican food this good! My husband loves the Nachos Mi Amigos with machaca beef. I am CRAZY for the green corn tamales. The chips are always served hot and the salsa is fresh. I cannot recommend this place highly enough!! I've read over the reviews and even the bad reviews of this place claim the food is good! Please consider opening one in the LA area!"}
{"text":"Horrible and fake! This is by far the WORST Mexican food that I have ever experienced. At first glance I was disappointed by the menu, then the chips and salsa came. Chips, bland but texturally good. Salsa, canned, fake and simply unacceptable. This is the point where I should have ran for the exit. I reluctantly ordered an asada taco only to be asked \"you mean a steak taco?\" My second cue to run for the door.  Then the food came. The beans are either freeze dried or frozen and oddly nutty. I perceive this at their very poor attempt to shine up a ball of fecal matter. The rice, meh, but edible. The asada or \"steak\" at this MEXICAN restaurant, a saucy mess. I'll spare you all the rest of this mess of a meal.  Oh, my official Tip for this restaurant: If you must eat here, come for happy hour, have 8-10 of their margaritas then order something. Hopefully by this time you'll be too inebriated to know what you're eating."}
{"text":"Manager, hostess, and waiter were super friendly and helpful to meet my needs with allergies (gluten and soy). Fun time and place and food food. I ordered corn and shrimp soft and skillet/ grilled tacos. Would recommend."}
{"text":"My sis and I came here for a quick meal.  Our service was good and quick.  We had the fresh guac and shrimp/mango quesadilla.  Both were amazing.  The $2 margarita tasted like a $2 drink so I guess you get what you pay for.  The salsa and chips were great and I am looking forward to another trip to this spot!"}
{"text":"This place used to have a great Happy Hour with excellent Margaritas and snack foods. The chips were great and plentiful and the salsa was homemade. We went back last Saturday for Happy Hour and everything had changed for the worse. The drinks couldn't have had more than a tiny splash of tequila and the tortillas were without doubt awful. If you don't want to have a good Happy Hour than don't have one at all. We will never come back and suggest you don't either"}
{"text":"A co-worker and I found ourselves in downtown Phoenix trying to catch a view of President Obama leaving the Phoenix Convention Center after his speech to the VFW convention.  After just missing the president leaving, we wandered over to the Arizona Center and settled on Mi Amigo's for lunch.  The service was excellent. Our waitress was Rebeca. The food was so-so. There are a lot of Mexican restaurants in Phoenix, and this one doesn't top the list, but if you are in downtown Phoenix, and confined to that area, it's not bad.  Another Yelper complained about the salsa being weird, but if the standard salsa is not your choice, ask for the smooth hot salsa.  It's excellent!! You have to ask for it."}
{"text":"Americanized Mexican food doesn't get any better than Mi Amigos at the Arizona Center. My sister & I tried this restaurant last weekend and were amazed by the portion sizes, the quality of the food, size of the menu, and by the exceptional service we received.  We also thoroughly enjoyed the complimentary chips & salsa, House Margaritas, and the terrific Happy Hour prices.   Mi Amigos also validates parking for 2 hours at the AZ Center's parking garage."}
{"text":"At last another restaurant option to satisfy my mexican food cravings, and it's only minutes (minute?) from my house. The red sauce is tasty, the salsa is spicy and garlicky, and the beans and rice are flavorful. We got take-out so can't comment on the service except that as I walked into the restaurant to pick it up the hostess asked how I was doing and if I was \"MIchael\" (the name we gave for the order), she had the ticket all ready to go, no having to find my way to the bar like some other restaurants do their take-out, and the order was then brought out immediately. Granted, this was at 5 pm on a Sunday evening (yes we keep old-people-dinner hours) so it wasn't too busy. They even wrapped my tacos separately so they wouldn't get soggy sitting in the enchilada sauce! Speaking of, the chicken tacos were tasty but next time I'm going to get my boyfriend's order, the Monterey chicken enchiladas, wonderful chicken-y, cheesy goodness!"}
{"text":"Bad food. Meh Manager. Meh waitress. Do not waste your money here.   The ribs were rubbery. I assumed it was a Mexican barbecue sauce on ribs - the reason it was being sold in this Mexican restaurant, but it was some sloppy memphis barbecue sauce.The manager admitted that they have a Pakistani chef who tried to pull hail-Mary to boost sales in the restaurant. Instead of giving us 6 bones they gave us 5. When we asked them about it, the waitress apologized and said that it was the last rack of ribs. The manager came to us and tried to joke his way out. Later, he offered us a 10% discount on the price of the ribs. The 10% discount was much less than the cost of that one single rib. We didn't care to argue with him. We just wanted to get out and never come back!   The waitress was polite while speaking to us but took our plates away before we could finish eating."}
{"text":"If you're on a budget this place is probably 4 star however it's not for me. It's very bland- not something I'd expect from a Mexican restaurant."}
{"text":"It's a casual spot with great happy hour prices. I had the margarita for only $2.50. Get it frozen or on ice. The food was pretty standard for a casual family joint. Nothing spectacular but it wasn't bad. Don't expect super authentic Mexican food, just something to fill your tummy while you enjoy happy hour. The space was nice and bright. Comfortable space and seating. Servers and host were friendly."}
{"text":"Typical, nothing to write home about. The spinach was not even cut in the enchiladas. hot plate warm food."}
{"text":"Service was great. Waiters were all very friendly. I have a wheat allergy and they were very helpful, they do have a gluten free menu though it's pretty limited. The food was pretty good, but the ambiance wasn't very impressive."}
{"text":"I really like this place. This had been at the Arizona Center forever when other restaurants have come and gone. My favorite things are the deep fried tacos and the chips and salsa. Margaritas are good too."}
{"text":"Honestly this was in the top 3 for worst food experience in my life. We had the chicken wrap and the fish tacos. The tacos were extremely fishy and not cooked very well. The chicken wrap tasted like something you would get at a circle K or a hospital cafeteria. The server was very nice and very quick to refill drinks and the salsa. The salsa actually tasted OK but you could tell it had been sitting out a while. I will never go back and I recommend you go somewhere else."}
{"text":"LOVE the Big girl beer here LOVE the table Guacamole LOVE the pork toquittos The SALSA good 2 and then go to the movies or vice a versa"}
{"text":"The decor looks like it is from a trendy burger joint.  Very industrial.  The food was bland and boring.  My tostado looked more like a salad with all the lettuce piled on it.  Very disappointed."}
{"text":"Came here for a quick bite. The restaurant wasn't busy and service was prompt. Ordered cheese crisp and wedge salad. Both were tasty and my picky wife liked it. Most importantly my beer was served right away and refill came just in time!"}
{"text":"Don't eat the fish tacos, my wife was up all night with intestinal distress. We told the waitress they tasted fishey. She assured us it was the highest quality Mahi Mahi. Rice and beans are average. I had the carnie asaida, it was good. It was a piece of beef 9\"by 6\" and 1/4\" thick, rice and beans. Nothing special."}
{"text":"Just went for a couple drinks. Reasonably priced, had 5 drinks between my husband and I and it was only $29.00. Nice atmosphere and everyone was friendly. Was not too busy for a Saturday night, but I enjoyed my time and service was perfect for the occasion."}
{"text":"Worse than elementary school cafeteria food!  It's just a buffet back there.  A horrible one at that."}
{"text":"Wow, this place sucks hard.  Went in to try to get a quick dinner before a movie next door.  Sat at the bar with my friend, got a beer.  Ordered a taco plate, and waited, then waited... 35 min later I asked how things were going.  The bartender admitted she forgot to put in the order.  She had been in close proximity this entire time, don't know how that's possible.  The place was also near empty on a weekend night, probably a bad sign.   I then said I needed to go.  No apologies and instead a $9 bill for a Dos Equis, which in my mind should have been immediately comped just to save a shred of their dignity.  Got the hell out of there, and may have been for the best based on prior food reviews.    Just go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Went with the wife and 3 other couples for a quick bite before the hardcore drinking last night. I must say, for a Friday night, and a group of 8, they got us right in and took really good care of us. Our waitress was really nice, they were quick, the food all came out at the same time and everyones was correct! Shouldn't be such a big deal to say that, but such are the times.    I got the carne asada and I couldn't tell you what everyone else got, but I know I saw some fish tacos, a burrito plate and some other stuff, most importantly, everyone seemed to like it. For anyone else that happened to be there last night- I apologize, we were that table- louder than everyone around us, but we're a nice group so back off!   Anyway, I have not been the biggest fan of the AZ Center in the past, but this place totally did the job and set a good tone for the night!"}
{"text":"I was so proud of myself for finally getting around to cashing in the $5 coupon I received for running the 10K Turkey Trot last Thanksgiving, which Mi Amigo's sponsors, and I gotta tell ya, I really, really wish I hadn't. Bad food, worse service. The waitress was hot, though. Rude, but hot.  I ordered the Shrimp & Scallop Enchiladas, which basically consisted of a couple stale tortillas covered with runny cheese, topped off with half a dozen miniature shrimps and scallops. Oh, and a small pile of cold beans and white (white, really?) rice. My date actually grimaced when they brought out the food - grimaced! - and said, \"You're not really going to eat that, are you?\"  We were in a drinking mood and surely would have spent good money doing it, but after she brought the food, we never saw the hot waitress again - Ever! - and I actually had to get up and ask another, much less attractive waitress for the bill.  Here's the best part - they took my $5 coupon but didn't apply it to the bill. A-holes."}
{"text":"Gross.. Besides that the waitress didn't even like working there. She forgot my sons drink like 3x. Will never go back."}
{"text":"Good food, but pricey. Suggest going to happy hour from 3-6 everyday. A decent sized meal will cost you $12-$17."}
{"text":"If I worked closer I would go here every day for lunch!  Seriously!  The food is so flavorful & delicious.  When I worked closer I literally spent probably half my paycheck here for lunches.  That's how good it is.  Plus they have really good service at really decent prices. Wish I lived & worked closer so I could get my \"mi amigos fix\" every day again."}
{"text":"Good food. Great salsa. Poor service. They don't want you to eat the salsa!!  Got numero uno. Food was good.   Chips and salsa very good. Difficult to get to get any salsa or more chips. Unable to get drink refills."}
{"text":"We had a large (20 or so) group go to Mi Amigo's before a Rattler's game. They knew we were coming and assigned us a very competent server. There were probably 12 different checks and some moving around of people and Laura handled it all perfectly.  Three of us at my table tried items off the $2.50 Happy Hour menu. The beef taco and cheese enchilada were a sweet deal at $5. Really nice flavor on the enchilada sauce. The folks who ordered the guacamole (prepared at your table) also enjoyed their food.  Finally, $2.95 for a bottle of Dos Equis Amber is a good deal but $2.95 for the big glass is a great deal!"}
{"text":"Honestly, this place isn't anything exceptionally special. I expected it to be a bit more upscale for the Arizona Center, but it reminded me of your run-of-the-mill Mexican places you can find everywhere.  Now don't get me wrong, it was delicious for a lunchtime choice and I'm glad I went because it was tasty but I just wouldn't go back. For one, the salsa was very chunky. Chunky in a way that it was all tomato, cilantro, onions, etc. But the chips served with were interesting in the fact that they were always hot out of the oven and were long tomale-like shapes rather than poured out of a bag. I got the Lunch Special #18 and my friends got #20 and #22. Whichever is the chulopa, get that one! Mine was just an enchilada with rice and beans and although it was the cheaper option on the menu, it wasn't exciting.  I would recommend this place is you're craving just some basic Mexican food and don't have a long lunch hour. I would ALSO suggest this place for HH. I didn't get to drink but they're specials looked bomb!"}
{"text":"I have not tried something on the menu that i dont like :D, love this place, fresh chips and salsa , food taste good and always good service. I recommended Yes"}
{"text":"...the margaritas were really good... That's where it begins and ends. The food was really bland and we were charged $1.50 for a side of sour cream...which I didn't use because I didn't eat enough of my burrito to need it. We are big fans of Mexican food and aside from friendly service and a good but overpriced margarita there is nothing about this place that makes us want to come back."}
{"text":"Service was extremely slow. Food portions were small. Food had little flavor and worst of all, they ran out of salsa. That's right, 2pm on a nice Sunday afternoon they ran out of salsa. Don't know what happened to this place, but it is not worth the price at all."}
{"text":"My wife and I love this place. Our go to for dinner and a movie, everything I've ever had here is delicious. Maybe it's partly the nostalgia for me as I grew up with Mi Amigo's in the east valley. Consistently great food at a decent price, can't complain about that."}
{"text":"Pretty good food. Pop in here for a quick lunch or a quick dinner. I wouldn't plan on coming here for a nice dinner while on vacation, but after a long day of sightseeing, if you want to just sit down and get some Mexican and a few coronas without having to go back to the hotel and shower and get dressed up, this place will do. I think it's a bit more pricey then Sam's Place next door, but check the menus on line."}
{"text":"Not sure why the negative reviews for this place...  Went here on a Saturday night with a group of 18.  Made reservations in advance.  Got there and tables were all ready.  Sat down and in a couple of minutes, we were munching on good chips and salsa.  Servers came by and got our drink orders while our volleyball girls got to order their meals.  After sipping our tasty margaritas and chatting for a little bit, servers came back and got our food orders while they brought out the orders for our VB girls.  In less than 10 minutes, we all got our meals and dug in.  When everyone was done, almost every plate was empty...no doggy bags for the lot!  My wife and I shared the sampler and everything on it was good and filling.  Our daughters, who usually always leave something to take home, didn't leave anything behind.  After polling the group, looks like everyone was satisfied and said their meal was tasty and filling.  The group is from the San Diego area, so they know their Mexican food.  We had good food, great service, and left the restaurant with good feelings.  If we come back for the 2018 Volleyball Festival, you can rest assured that we will eat at this restaurant again."}
{"text":"Went to the movie early Saturday evening, but ate beforehand. I wish I had waited to eat at the theatre concession stand. I know I would have gotten tastier food for the money. I ordered the Carne Asada...it was bland  and as tough as shoe leather. I told the waitress and she said, \"oh, ok\". I foolishly expected a manager to approach the table, but that didn't happen. When she brought the bill, I had been charged $14, essentially for rice and refried beans because the carne asada was barely touched. I also drank 2 margaritas during their happy hour...didn't even catch a buzz and I am a lightweight when it comes to alcohol. I did get heartburn, though. My first trip to this place will be my last! Why didn't I check Yelp first????"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I ended up getting food poisoning!  I was extremely disappointed, because the location is near our condo and the staff was so friendly!  I think we are going to the emergency room!"}
{"text":"I have been frequenting this place since I was a little guy with my family so it does hold a warm little place in my heart as a decent Mexican food place. It's family owned, and has a fairly large menu.   There's nothing really great and nothing really bad to say about this place, which is why I guess it doesn't do much for me. Sure it holds some degree of nostalgia for me and the tortilla chips are actually my favorite of all of the Mexican food places we frequent. (My taste in chips runs to the light and crispy side so if you like em thick and crunchy, you'll likely not share my enthusiasm.)   But on the flip side, the last time I ate there I could have sworn I ordered the carne asada fajitas... yes yes, I know I did because my bill clearly stated \"Carne Asada\". However, I also remember eating something that resembled the bottom of an old leather shoe and was just as tough. Although I think the bottom of an old shoe would have had more flavor.   Geez, so why 3 stars? Well, on the whole the food is good and the wait staff is friendly but I'll admit most of my rating probably comes from the chips and the fond memories.   If you're nearby, you could find worse places to eat Mexican, but don't make a trip just to come to Mi Amigos."}
{"text":"Sorry, previous review was for the wrong store. This one is great."}
{"text":"Food so bad the manager ordered Dominos Pizza while we were there!  When the manager of a restaurant has pizza delivered, that's a bad sign. My fish platter came with \"roasted vegetables\" that were still raw. The manager insisted that's the way they were supposed to be. She argued with us, and was incredibly rude. She was talking loudly, almost shouting, and then stormed off.   Don't eat here!"}
{"text":"I love a margarita! Usually when I treat myself to one I get a hard time when I ask for it frozen. If fact most places will try to talk me out of it! I came in asked for it and got it no problem! In fact, the bartender \"Rachel\" gave me the glass with the little bit extra! It's those little things that matter to me! I wasn't hungry, but my husband and I didn't get a hard time when we decided to split a burrito, in fact they split it for us! It's not the best thing I've ever tasted, but it's o.k. I think if they improved on the food a bit and kept this service I would hate it here because they were to busy! Lol!"}
{"text":"This place sucks! beans were inedible! I ordered the chicken rolled tacos they were the worst rolled tacos I've ever eaten in my life!"}
{"text":"Everything we ordered was delicious! Service is just ok. Fried icream was incredible!"}
{"text":"A rip off! Grilled fish tacos contained as much fish as a small anchovy. Don't know how they kept it from falling through the grill. The chicken taco soup should be called chicken cumin soup. My last visit."}
{"text":"Happy hour is great. We had Leti as a waitress and she was lovely. I would return because she was so sweet and made us all laugh."}
{"text":"The food was really good, with the exception of the fajitas. Beware: their fajitas are mostly onions and green peppers, not worth $18. The service was mediocre at best. I would recommend this restaurant if you don't like to have your drinks refilled, and you love onion and pepper fajitas."}
{"text":"Good food. They try to seat you on the middle which has way too much traffic and noise so we always have to re direct. The wait staff are pretty good. They need to take down the offensive sign \"...... somewhere in the world a vegan is crying\""}
{"text":"Gotta give this place a 5 star rating for the food AND the staff. We've eaten at all their stores--even the ones they ill advisedly closed. All are superb. The food is just about the best--we like the pork taquitos. the green corn tomales, and the chili pablamos rellenos (not your grandmother's chilli rellenos). The wait staff and management make you feel like this is YOUR place. They used to make a fantastic queso fundido--encourage them, maybe they will restart.  Dos Equis prices during happy hour are worth the visit--goes great with the hot bean dip!  Do it, you'll love it."}
{"text":"Heading to catch a flick at The Arizona Center. Decided to checked out Mi Amigo's. To start with, it took about 5 minutes before anyone bother to talk to us. Once we did get to order, we opted to share the tortilla soup and the chicken fajitas. The tortilla soup was really bad. It tasted like a mix of chili powder and salt. We ended up sending it back. The chicken fajitas were actually ok, but not great.   The real downer was the service. Waitstaff appeared to be fairly apathetic about the place. Limited interested in actually taking our order, bringing out food, etc..  Overall, there are much better choices. You should look elsewhere if you are hungry for Mexican food."}
{"text":"Wonderful place to eat. Very busy, we sat at the bar and the waitress took care of all six is and handled tables. Great service and wonderfully priced lunch menu. Very much worth the visit!"}
{"text":"Clean restaurant, friendly service, but very average mexican food.  Reasonable prices and not a bad option if you're in the area."}
{"text":"Wonderful food, service & atmosphere at a decent price.  I had the carnitas - the meat was perfectly moist, tender and just enough spice.  Hubby had a chicken burrito - it was thoroughly enjoyed.  House margarita topped the meal wonderfully.  Waitress was very attentive and friendly.  A group of 10 people came in and the staff made sure they were seated promptly.  Couldn't ask for better service."}
{"text":"Once again, I ordered carne asada expecting the meat to be flavorful, well seasoned and cooked to perfection.  Once again, it was a chewy, mediocre seasoned piece of meat. I hedged my bet and order a couple of enchiladas ala carte.  At least those were tasty.  Service was kind of roller coastery.  The server took my drink order immediately and gave me a few minutes to peruse the menu.  Food came relatively promptly.  When she brought the bill, well she decided it was time to do a deep cleaning of the bar area while I sat and played solitaire on my phone.  Finally she came by only because she was dropping an order off at the table behind me.  The place was 3/4 empty, but I can attribute this to being 8pm on a Sunday night in downtown Phoenix.  In fact most of the mall was deserted and restaurants closed.  I end with one suggestion.  Lower the freekin light that is hanging over the table.  Nothing worse that having to catch the glint of a halogen bulb burning your eyes while you eat."}
{"text":"My family took the banquet room and hosted a large party here. The decor is OK, and comfortable with an old world mexican feel.  Now, i'd give the place more stars, but the food was really unmemorable, maybe because we had to order from a separate banquet menu,  and my drinks were totally overpriced.   I could have literally ate out somewhere else and received drinks and full dishes for the amount I paid. In fact they overcharged me, then were actually rude about it when I called them the following day.  Wait staff was virtually non-existant to our party of 15-20 people.  I couldn't believe the dining experience was so poor, which I didn't expect when I first sat down at our table. This place seriously needs some major changes for me to go back."}
{"text":"Asked how much the grilled shrimp tacos would be without the rice and beans and I was told $5.25.  The full entree was about $11.50.  When I got the bill it was  $10.50!!  The waitress never said it was $5.25 EACH TACO.  That's a ridiculous price for flour tortilla, lettuce, and a few pcs of shrimp!  I won't be back."}
{"text":"This is one of the best Mexican places I've been to in 2 and a half years in Phoenix. Most recently,  I had a quesadilla with beef machaca from the suggestion of my bartender and it was so bomb. The beef was perfect and I could tell it was high quality.. Too many times I've been disappointed because of horrible quality meat at Mexican joints. Before that I went here before a movie and got the carne asada platter medium rare and it was cooked to perfection. Best $13 steak I've ever had by far. Service was friendly and quick. Definitely will be back."}
{"text":"Service was great! We had the chicken fajitas and cheese crisp. Tortillas were not good. Beans and rice were bland. Chicken did not have very good flavor and the cheese crisp was soggy. Not real authentic Mexican food"}
{"text":"My family and friends came here last week and I was not impressed. I was so surprised to walk in on a Sunday afternoon after church service and the place was dead, but then after having their food, I can understand why.  I got the Carna Asada burro, husband got chicken tacos, and I ordered off the kid's meal chicken strips. Let's just say we won't be coming back. My son got sick from the food he ate. I only ate the burro and no offense. I'd rather eat Filberto's burrito. The service was great though. The food not so much."}
{"text":"I've had their food before and it was very good and last night wasn't exactly an exception.  My issue is that my 8 year old had their chicken fingers, which I tried and were quite tasty.  After our meal my son stated he felt ill, and this morning woke up with a mild case of food poisoning.  I will be avoiding this place for the foreeable future.  This is unfortunate, as their enchiladas are delicious but I simply will not risk my son getting sick again.  Sorry Mi Amigos, your apparent lack of food preparation cleanliness has lost you customer."}
{"text":"This place is an embarrassment to mexican restaurants. The food here is terrible! Here's what we ordered: Combo taco/enchilada / oily taco, diarrhea enchilada  Green chilie burrito / the tortilla was plastic and the filling was gross. Taco salad / bunch of stuff with zero taste. Should have grazed in the planter. The beans and rice? Really? They couldn't even get that right. Under cooked bland rice and under cooked beans. This place sux! Beer is good."}
{"text":"Best tortilla soup! They serve the toppings on the side so they do not get soggy and the taste is perfect. Paired with a Pacifico draft for lunch is the perfect meal."}
{"text":"I really don't have much to say about this place. I didn't hate it, but didn't love it.   I do have to say that if you can get in before 6 PM to take advantage of their happy hour pricing, do it. The margarita's I ordered were okay, but not worth the $7.25 a piece I paid for them.   I ordered the tortilla soup and the crispy shredded beef taco (a la carte). The soup was so-so. A little salty and way too many kernels of corn for my taste. Of course one kernel of corn is too many for me.  And for the tortillas, there was none in the soup. They gave me little crispy shreds to dump in. Eh....  As for the taco. It was good, and the size was perfect for me. But one could argue that it wasn't big enough for the price you pay for it.   Finally the service was okay. The waitress was very nice and attentive. The food did come out super quick.   So yeah...that's about it."}
{"text":"Bad reviews for slow service while fair don't provide a good portrait of this yummy Mexican tucked away in a mall.   Get the shrimp and mango quesadilla to start and try not to eat too much of the fresh and delicious salsa."}
{"text":"I have worked downtown at the Arizona Center for over 4 years. We have a cafeteria here in our building and several other restaurant options at the Arizona Center.  I consistently go to Mi Amigo's for lunch.  I could eat there every day and never get tired of the food.  Their menu offers many great selections for lunch, dinner and/or Happy Hour.  The food is delicious and the chips and salsa are usually what entice me to to eat there more than once in a week.  If by Friday of each week, I haven't been there, I tell my co-workers that \"I need my fix\" and they know exactly what I mean.  Every waiter/waitress is so pleasant.  They are all so accommodating, full of smiles, and they make our lunch experience great EVERY SINGLE TIME!  We enjoy the outdoor seating when the weather is nice.  There are affordable lunch options, and if you don't like something, they'll gladly make you something else you want.  And lastly, Chris, the day manager, ROCKS!  :-)"}
{"text":"This place used to be amazing !!! Years ago it was the best Mexican food around! But over the years they have cut back on portioning and when they did the big renovation ( which in my opinion is horrible) they have limited the menu choices much that there is literally nothing left .... Lucky for me they still have the Nachos ... They are pretty good with the shredded beef on them!  I so wish they would bring back the chicken spinach and mushroom burrito!  My advice ..... Go to the Gilbert location ... They are much better .. We drive out of our way to go to that one usually now! Oh and the blue amigo is a great margarita ... And only 2.50"}
{"text":"Ugh. Just don't. Take my advice and just don't. Some of the worst Mexican food I've ever had in my life and I've eaten at Taco Bell. Salsa is clearly from a jar, my MIL's quesadilla wasn't even warm or the cheese melted, this is a hard pass."}
{"text":"Been going for years. I just love it. Thats it."}
{"text":"This may be the worst Mexican food I have ever tasted... I was starving and couldn't even finish it.  I got the sampler so I tasted everything, nothing was good:( so sad because they were nice."}
{"text":"Wow! I headed to Mi Amigo's with a group of friends in search of amazing (and cheap) margaritas. What I found was a restaurant that serves up $2.50 margaritas (the \"blue amigo\") and has amazing food! You HAVE to try the Chile Relleno. Seriously. It was the best Mexican dish I've ever had! Definitely check this place out when in Phoenix!"}
{"text":"Very pleasant surprise! They use lard for only a couple of items and you can get them without lard. The salsa and veggies were bomb. The tortilla my burrito was wrapped in was fresh and wad easily cut through. Our server was attentive, quick, and appeared happy. I couldn't leave this place without yelping. From this experience, I think it deserves it."}
{"text":"We love the green corn tamales and tacos. Great food. I get tamales here every year too for the holidays. It's my moms favorite. I take my family here who is visiting from out of state. Very yummy"}
{"text":"Delicious Food! Authentic and tasteful atmosphere! Fast and friendly family night had a pleasant and peaceful weekday evening. I will definitely be returning with my family. The restaurant is very clean, the servers are quick and efficient."}
{"text":"I've been going to Mi Amigo's for years and have never seen a better Mexican food place, absolutely love it! The service is excellent, always seated right away. The salsa is different and great every time. A definite must go."}
{"text":"Grew up with mi amigos. Nachos mi amigo regular. I was upset they raised prices. Not as busy anymore."}
{"text":"Not only is Mi Amigo's located inside the same esplanade/plaza as my all-time favourite AMC theatres, but Mi Amigo's makes fast food seem like it takes forever.  We got here right at noon. There was apparently a conference going on in Phoenix the same day because there were people everywhere wearing badges from different universities from all over the world. This place was PACKED. I could tell that the staff was not expecting this rush because they only had 3 servers and 1 bus boy and every table and chair in the house was taken.  We were told we would have to wait 5 minutes for a table, but 30 seconds later we were walked right in. As I mentioned, the place was PACKED and every single one of the servers had a glow about them from running around like crazy. They were HUSTLIN' and they did an impeccable job.   Because there were only about 3 servers on staff this day, each server was responsible for one third of the restaurant (and it is HUGE). Each of them was helping the other out; I saw them running one another's food, and clearing plates regardless of whose section it was.  Our food arrived moments after we ordered it, and despite the fact that the restaurant was slammed, everyone was very pleasant. They made sure to smile in between their sprints to and from the kitchen.  It was a wonderful experience dining at Mi Amigo's and we actually ended up going twice over the weekend because we enjoyed it so much.  This place deserves mad props. It's quick, it's cheap (we paid $15 for 3 people's lunch) and it most definitely hits the spot."}
{"text":"Place kind of reminds me of a bigger version of Taco Bell. Rice is too bland and the beans are ok. I did order the Sonora carnitas and they did have a nice flavor. It seemed it needed to be cooked more and needed a little more seasoning.  The service was good and the prices are reasonable. This place has potential. But it's not there yet."}
{"text":"Food was very bland. Portions were decent for just ok food. Looking around you notice they do not clean very well here. Light fixtures had a layer of dust. Thank goodness the fans were not on as there was caked black dust all on the blades. Will not be coming in ever again."}
{"text":"Just wanted to come back and update. We've gone 3 or 4 more times since I posted my initial review, and I can honestly say that each experience has been consistently awesome. Excellent service, excellent food. :)"}
{"text":"Had it not been for the fact that I was starving and went with a friend who wanted to eat there, I would have returned the food, which is something I almost never do. Way overpriced for what you get and the enchilada sauce tasted like it came straight out of a can. The chips were stale and tasteless, although the pico de gallo was decent. The taco shell was greasy and limp, like something made by a stoned teenager as a 3:00 a.m. snack. Yes, I ate it anyway, as like I said, I was starving. However, I very deeply regretted eating any of it later. So if you would like some terrible food, followed by regret and a need to be alone, this would be a great place for you."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I thought we'd stop in for lunch at Mi amigo's (which is grammatically incorrect) and we would have some good Mexican food. We came at noon and it was busy so we thought \"Oh, it seems to have a big crowd\" meaning better food. But It was old food that probably been sitting out for at least a half hour. The freshest thing we had was the free chips and salsa. The staff was very nice and friendly but the food wasn't any good. Just thought I'd let people know."}
{"text":"Average food, convenient location and decent prices.  Good place for a quick bite or a casual dinner."}
{"text":"I so love this place , I've been going to Mi Amigos sense 2000.  When their was a location on Elliott and Guadalupe which is closed now . go to the one in Gilbert . I even did a promo for their gilbert location . and i have also referred a lot of co workers as well as family to please try this place, so it Saddens me to say that lately the location in Downtown phoenix is not up to par as it used to . I've called in orders and they have gotten my Chicken Cesar salads Wrong ! Yes I know can they get a salad wrong ? They have me I guess it was the Mi amigo salad has avacado in it , which I would never order I'm allergic.  Well anyway,  This week alone I ordered Chicken Caesar salads . and their portions were so so small you could put them together to make 1 regular salad, not sure what's going on with this location , and some of the host in there could use a little courtesy classes .  I really hope that the owner of this location reads these reviews ."}
{"text":"Great food.  Green chili enchiladas with chicken are fantastic.  Quick and great service."}
{"text":"First time here June 26. The sever Joseph was great. I asked him what he liked best, it was the Rellen Platter. It is Mi Amigo's version of a Chili Relleno. I didn't even see it on the menu until Joseph pointed it out and I'm pretty sure I wouldn't have ordered it. This was one of the best meals I have had in awhile! Hands down! Full of flavor, hot, fresh, and with a side of beans and rice. The portion size was huge! The food also came out fast."}
{"text":"We enjoy the food at Mi Amigo's, but I think it's a bit pricey for the quality and quantity. My favorite is their enchiladas with beans and rice. My children enjoy the chips and salsa the most and we usually go through many bowls of chips before our entrees arrive. I wish their portions were not so spare. I think we would go more often if there were larger portions or a lower price."}
{"text":"Loved the food and drink!   The nachos with muchaca under the appetizer menu was GINORMOUS, it was so much food between the two of us, we could not finish it. The blue type margaritas that are presently on special for $2 a piece, all day, are fantastic.  Our server was super cool and on top of her game and for a total of four drinks and the increadibly large appitizer, we paid $27. How can you beat that?!"}
{"text":"Took the family out to dinner and they seemed to enjoy it here.  I had the chili rellenos and they were properly cooked and tasty.  The bean dip was tasty as was the chips and sauce.  They kept up with the beers and other drinks as needed.  I'd go back again."}
{"text":"I really like this place and have been here eons apart on a few occasions, most recently this past weekend. The staff is friendly and quick. The food is delish, with just the right portions (big but not insanely huge) The blue margarita was good if a bit sour. I am usually not one to eat chips and salsa, but theirs is really good and I devoured it all. The restroom was clean and tidy."}
{"text":"awful Mexican food - if you could call it Mexican food. They must be known for their happy hour because the food is awful even the chips and salsa are horrible. I am amazed they are still in business."}
{"text":"Mi Amigo's has great happy hour specials.  The chips and salsa were pretty average. For lunch I had a chicken chimichanga with rice and beans.  The portion size was perfect. It was just enough to fill you without being stuffed.  I also had a  their house house special, a blue margarita with a sugared rim.  It was a little sweet and you couldn't really taste the alcohol.  But it was only $2.50 so you can't complain.  We ended with honey and powered sugar sopapillas but they weren't as fluffy as other places.  The staff was friendly and got our order out pretty quickly. Perfect if you are stopping by on a lunch break."}
{"text":"Service was 5-star Chips & salsa were 5-star food was just ok, kind of plain.  I'm a Mexican food snob so you may like it more than we did."}
{"text":"It's food isn't as the waitperson. She super at explaining some of the dishes, my daughter didn't know.   She was prompt at with refilling our ice tea, but not hovering.  3 stars for her, 1star for the food."}
{"text":"I'm not a fan of mexican restaurants that have crappy salsa and chips. Sorry, it's just a standard by which I live by. The chips were nothing special and did not taste freshly made (closer to store bought which wouldn't be a surprise). The salsa was 95% water which is a bummer. We had to ask for extra because there wasn't much substance.   I ordered the sampler platter dish which came with a little bit of everything. The taquitos were yummy, but that was about it. I smothered most things with guacamole to make it edible and left about half the plate. My friend had the tacos and seemed just fine with them.  The service was awesome until we were looking for the check to leave. Then we had a hard time finding our waiter. If you like Taco Del Mar you'll be satisfied, however I expected a LOT more out of a mexican restaurant in Phoenix."}
{"text":"The chips and salsa were probably the best part of the meal. I ordered the chicken nachos and the chicken was not good. The portion size was good, the service was good and the beer was cold but I wouldn't eat here again. They do have a happy hour which is great but the food wasn't that good. Convenient location is you're looking for something close to downtown Phoenix."}
{"text":"Disappointed with the food. For it being a Mexican restaurant this food was horrible. Chips and salsa was gross. Paste is better. Ordered green chicken enchiladas and I got rolled enchiladas with cubed chicken that looked like fajita chicken."}
{"text":"Hands down best Happy Hour around. The food is just OK. However the awesome staff and great prices make it a weekly spot for my friends and I. If your looking for amazing food this may not be the spot for you. If you are looking for reasonably priced HH with a casual welcoming vibe this is it!"}
{"text":"authentic? i couldn't say. better selection than new england offers? definitely. okay so maybe that's not a high compliment for a mexican grill in the heart of the southwest, but after a very long day of walking around I stopped in (lone woman too) was quickly seated and served so fast i actually told the waitress \"don't worry there's no rush\".  i got a green corn tamale which i've never had (and i do consider myself well traveled in the food world) and some really fresh chunky salsa that i downed in about a minute. refried beans and rice were very standard and not worth the extra money ($1.75 EACH) to add on to the $5 tamale, but what the hell.   i've had hundreds of sopapillas in my life and i've never seen the type of sopapilla i was served for dessert, so i'm sort of at a loss for words on that. except of course that it could have used a lot more honey and powdered sugar.   for me this was the best option in a neighborhood of uno's, hooters, and other generic american bar food. mi amigo's was just what i was looking for."}
{"text":"This place has gone down hill. Salsa has more spice to it so it is not enjoyable. They raised there prices and the portions are smaller. Its a fast and convenient place to go but not true Mexican food and over priced!"}
{"text":"This will not be your average sit down and eat dinner review. I was here with a large party of 30, after the weekend work event and people were definitely ready to drink and eat. I ordered a skinny margarita with Patron which I came to regret after tasting it. It was pretty gross. Everyone else seemed to like their house margaritas, which were also very cheap. Mine came to $14. Our appetizers were ordered for us, the chips and salsa were complimentary snd we ordered guacamole and cheese crisps -which is their version of quesadillas. The guacamole was good and they make it right in front of you in a bowl. It was just the right amount of spicy. People were complaining that the salsa was too hot, but I thought it was just right. The more authentic the better, in my opinion. I did not try the cheese crisps but everybody liked them and they looked good. I ordered the Mexican grilled chicken salad. I had already eaten so many chips I didn't want to feel worse about myself. The grilled chicken was amazing, there wasn't much the salad other than that. They only gave me two pieces of avocado. The chipotle ranch dressing was amazing, though. Everyone else's meals looked delicious and the portions are huge. Honestly, you can get one plate and share it with someone, for sure. Then, they brought out a Mexican dessert and everybody seem to like that, but most people were too full to even entertain the idea of dessert. I thought it was interesting that the restaurant is called Mi Amigos, when in Spanish it should translate into Mis Amigos. I asked one of our servers, and he told me that the owners are American and made a mistake but that restaurant has been open for 20 years. I found that a little odd but interesting. Overall, the environment is pretty fun it is your typical Mexican style restaurant. Take it or leave it. It's located in the middle of the Arizona Center, so pretty easy to get there if you are in the downtown Phoenix area. Prices are very reasonable. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I've eaten here multiple times against my will because my ex loved the place. It's ok. Kind of quiet and boring atmosphere for a Mexican food place. I'd say to try Macayo's or On the Border for better Mexican chain food.   Who are you going to believe me or all the one review orange heads?  :p"}
{"text":"Ok Mexican food.  Stopped in for lunch and ordered the number three which is a two taco and cheese enchilada plate. Food was ok, but nothing I would go back for."}
{"text":"Interesting place. Wanted a quick bite to eat before heading to the movies. Was seated pretty quickly. No muss no fuss I presume.  I had the tortilla soup and the grilled chicken tacos. Everything was just meh. Not truly flavorful, nothing truly distinct. I had hoped for more, but I came up kind of short. The waiter was super sweet and attentive, so I did appreciate that!  Would I be back.. probably not."}
{"text":"If I could give a half star, I would have.  Though I should have known when I drove up to the place and there were only 3 other cars in the parking lot that it was going to be a bust.  After a traitorous hiking experience, my bf and I were in desperate need of some deslish Mexican food, but unfortunately we were disappointed with yucky Mexican food. I got the chicken soft tacos which were WAY overpriced for two little flour tortillas that contained about 6 cubes of chicken each and that's it, no cheese, no nothin'. His chicken mole enchiladas were even worse! The (dark meat) chicken was so dry and tough he couldn't even finish it and that's not usual coming from someone who always cleans their plate n then finishes mine.  We ended up spending 50 bucks on a lunch that was really (for lack of a better term) gross.   Sorry, but you're not our Amigo and we won't be returning."}
{"text":"Pretty average Mexican Food...Not the worst I've ever had, but nothing unique about the food or atmosphere. It'll get you by if you happen to be nearby and craving Mexican food."}
{"text":"I went here to grab lunch and a beer between classes. The service wasn't all that great. I don't think the waitress ever told me her name. I ordered the fish tacos and a tall beer. They start you off with chips and salsa. The chips were really good but the salsa could have been better. The fish tacos were just okay. They needed something more. The food came out quickly which was a plus. As others have mentioned, this place definitely has potential but needs a bit of work. I definitely will go back in the future during my lunch break."}
{"text":"The food here is usually pretty good, however, I was onced served a meal that had rotten tomatos in it, and haven't returned since"}
{"text":"The chips were very watery. I ordered the guacamole made at my table. They brought it out in a salad bowl, not very classy of mexicanish! The server was courteous which is always a must for me. As I'm writing I'm tasting the guacamole. Very bland! I had to add the weak \"hot sauce\" they have to it for some semblance of flavor. The shrimp tacos are mediocre at best. I was going to give this place 3 stars but after eating the shrimp tacos I went down one more star."}
{"text":"2 stars for kid-friendly. Taco salad shell was not crispy, which is half the fun. Kids Menu fruit is actually a Dole fruit cup. To be fair, the menu did not specify \"fresh\" fruit."}
{"text":"Nasty margarita and awful service. Came in on a Thursday night before a movie and it was not good. Maybe it's because we sat at the bar? I'm not sure, but no one wanted to help us. The house margarita was so gross, couldn't drink it. This place is like the Chili's of mexican food."}
{"text":"Had an awesome time.. love love there authentic Mexican food. Bartender/waiter was awesome.  Also made the best Cadillac Margarita and gave my daughter best Birthday wishes.. thanks"}
{"text":"We came with a large group, and they did a great job with the service. The food was brought out fairly quickly, and was very good.  It was pretty standard Mexican fare done well. I had red Chile with big chunks of meat that was tender with a good consistency (a lot of spice-not really too hot, but strong). The others in my party were all happy as well. I'll come back."}
{"text":"Hours listed on Yelp last night shows Mi Amigos closed at 11pm. A group of us ,driving 4 separate cars parked and paid for parking at the Arizona Center. We arrived around 10:25pm and were all told they were closed. When we told them about the hours, they said it was for a different location.  The food here is just gringo Mexican anyways and service is sub standard but they listed they were opened and others showed closed. I won't  be going back."}
{"text":"Chains can be disappointing, but this place was pretty good.  The food was tasty, just a little on the expensive side for Mexican food.  I wish they had a better drink menu:    you can get a blue margarita (for 2.00 = good deal) or a regular margarita (that's it).  If your looking for authentic you should probably go somewhere else.  If you live in the neighborhood, your hungry, and you feel like some nice Mexican food...this place isn't bad."}
{"text":"I love this place! I work close, so I visit quite often. The Chicken Burrito is amazing, the salsa is awesome and they have the best enchilada sauce in town! The service is always great... fast and friendly!"}
{"text":"Food is really, really bad and the restaurant just seems dirty.  We waited quite a long time for our food as well. Staff was friendly however. I wouldn't recommend the food at all."}
{"text":"After a long day volunteering for a nerd convention, was looking for a meal to fill me up.  This place was right across the street from hotel. Great choice. I had red chile chimichanga and my wife had the ribs. Only CON was that CON had just closed for the evening and nerds flooded the place causing a shortage of Mr. Pibb and delayed our meal since they were so busy.  I overheard staff talking to manager about running out of other items on menu.  Staff was pretty happy about closing early because of it.  I don't blame them!  We'll be back when the next nerd herd comes along!"}
{"text":"Went for lunch on a Thursday with some co-workers. One was from Florida the other Canada.  They both really liked it.  It was the third visit by one of them. My first.  I ordered the Chili Rellano. A large Pablano pepper stuffed with chunks of chicken and typical fillings. It was dipped and fried in a panko bread crumb -like batter which I really liked compared to the \"traditional\" egg batter. It was thin and light. Great tasting to.  Service was excellent. I was never left wanting for a refill of my tasty beverage and they kept the salsa and hot sauces full as well as the tortilla chips. The chips were good too. They were light and tasted fresh. Not the out-of-a-bag corn chips. I will be back."}
{"text":"Very Good AZ Mexican food.  Kind of expensive.  Decor is nice.  Restaurant is a class act.  Prices on the menu were a bit alarming to me.  But I thought the food was one of the better examples of AZ mexican food (in the Matta's, Serrano's, Garcia's tradition) I have tried."}
{"text":"Just went here for lunch today, I had the green chile enchiladas, and now I have been sick all day. The waiter was very awkward, and very slow. The salsa was not bad, though. I most likely won't go back."}
{"text":"Salsa from a can at best. The food is extremely cheesy and so far away from being authentic. I requested to try other salsas. None had a real mexican flavor, the tomato salsa came close BUT it was obviously made with canned tomatoes so that's a big thumbs down right away.  I ordered the 'Numero 3' and it included an enchilada with 2 shredded beef tacos. The enchilada was also made with canned chile (sauce) and filled to the brim with salty cheddar cheese. Insert sad face right?  The shredded beef on the tacos was broken down so much and had a texture like it had been put in a blender and mashed around. Tasteless and topped with another generous helping of again... cheddar cheese.  The host was not really welcoming; the 2 stars are for our waiter which was extremely kind and deserves to be praised. Thank you, but I will not come again."}
{"text":"Visited this place right after checking in to the hotel right across the street for a conference. I was STARVING! A co-worker and I love Mexican food, so we decided to give this place a shot. We were greeted by a hostess, showed to our table, and not long after, the waitress came and got our drink and food order. We had to ask twice for chips and salsa. Salsa was a bit chunky...more like pico, and I don't care for chunks of tomato, so that turned me off. I ordered the chicken deep fried tacos. I really wasn't impressed. No flavor. The tortilla wasn't crispy enough. Not a good meat to veggie to tortilla ratio. Rice and beans were good though. Our flight had been delayed and it was pretty late, so when we were ready for our check, our waitress was no where to be found. I'm not sure that I'll ever try this place again if I'm ever back this way..."}
{"text":"Friendly smiling staff. Prompt service. The margaritas were weak and sour tasting. We had to order a shot of tequila to get it close. The street tacos had just two pieces of meat per taco. The street tacos lacked street quality. The other Mexican plates seemed either over sauced or greasy (reg. tacos). Drink prices inexpensive, but who wants a \"cheap\" drink? Thanks for reading. The Bike Chaplain"}
{"text":"I'd like to rate this from the catering/event side. I recently went to a reunion here. We had over 100 people and I was surprised how great the service was. The food was very good. We all had the best time. The owner was there and he made ABSOLUTELY sure people had a good time. I'd recommend them for big occasions."}
{"text":"I had the fish taco platter.  It was good and had both green and purple cabbage.  The tacos came with white rice and black beans (which I love).  I found the salsa hotter than I expected.  The tea was fresh and cold.    The only thing I would have improved is to have more flavorful fish.  It was a bit bland.  Overall an A-OK place to eat."}
{"text":"let me start by saying...any place that offers 77% off your meal, just for being born in the year 1977 is alright by me! that's right, last week was the 32nd year anniversary for the Restaurant, located around AZ, so they offered several super cheap deals on some great food! We were there on the day of the 77% discount and my seester and i ate like hogs for $12.50, of which $6.50 was my mango margarita (arriba arriba! so tasty) i had the cheese enchilada, chicken hard taco, tortilla soup and of course many a chip and salsa y creama (sour cream) the rice was delicious as always, the soup devine (the broth was made with red enchilada sauce). the chicken taco wasn't my favorite (sorry my ma makes the best) because of the ground chicken pattie type of thing that was fried in the tortilla shell. on the other hand, my sister said the chicken taco has been her favorite for the past 10 years that we've been eating there. oh yeah secrets out of the bag in this review....the salsa served here is the best hang over cure you can find in AZ, not sure why, and it might even be the chips, but they work wonders!   so the manager said earlier in the week of the anniversary, the numero uno was the same price as the day the restaurant first opened, but we missed that day. next year they will do the same, but take my word and don't wait,  the food was still very reasonably priced for everyday meals, and the happy hour is a local secret, one that is packed with cheap tasty treats, refreshing drinks and the tastiest salsa served with light crispy chips, i could fill up on those alone (and believe me there have been many a time i have!) enjoy this rare authentic treasure hidden in a tourist mall (go figure).  my only complaint is the lack of room in my stomach after that free basket of chips and the delicious salsa they pushed on me- which was actually very welcomed lol."}
{"text":"I'm a AZ native and can't get enough of Mexican food ..I am always trying out new spots so I know good Mexican food when I eat it.. unfortunately this place was not very good.. flavors were overall bland .. I got the bean dip as an appetizer, from what I remember it used to taste allot better .. got the lunch special with the taco and enchilada.. again just not very good.. BUT customer service was great .. probably won't go again .."}
{"text":"Yummy food. Great service. Food came quick. Happy hour 2.50 beer for domestic. 16 oz I think. Had grilled chicken tacos a la carte. My brother had same with rice and beans for 10.50. Restaurant too warm tho. Fans were running but not the air. I would return."}
{"text":"Still enjoyable. Wanted to add that I had the fish tacos this time, and they were quite tasty. Friendly staff. A good choice"}
{"text":"My coworker and I came here when we were in town for a conference. The service was good, waitress was attentive and got us everything we needed. She had a chile relleno and i had the spinach, avocado, shrimp salad. I thought the salad was good, it comes with raspberry viniagrette that's pretty sweet, so I picked some of the shrimp off to eat them on the side since they were salty. The salad was pretty simple and small. If you're going to get a salad and you're hungry, I suggest ordering something else to go with it because it might not fill you up.  We also got a fried ice cream. We split it and really enjoyed it- it came out quickly and with two spoons.   I personally did not care for the chips and salsa. The salsa was okay, but thick, and the chips were very thin and broke easily.   Mi Amigo's is a very affordable Mexican option downtown. We had a good experience with the service, but none of the food really wowed me. We could walk from our hotel and that was a nice touch, too."}
{"text":"Mediocre but dependable cuisine.  The food was hot, on time, not expensive, and fresh.  Our server was friendly.  We had a party of four and everybody enjoyed a good meal.  The decor was quite dated and made of materials easily washed.  We were there on a Tuesday night and it was maybe 15 percent occupied, a telling sign of a struggling restaurant.  This restaurant is a cut above some of the Mexican restaurants but way below some of the better ones in Mesa."}
{"text":"Great place and tasty food. The staff are really nice and friendly. The place is great. Don't forget to try the Flan Clasico."}
{"text":"Disappointing. This has been my go to place in the past. The carne Assado was so tough! Good jaw exercise though. Frozen Margarita was excellent."}
{"text":"I thought the food was excellent, unfortunately the service was not.  For our business lunch, the four of us waited loooooooooooooong periods, first to order, then for the food to arrive, then even to pay our bill.  And even though the bill was a simple \"divide total by four\", one member of our group got exactly twice her fourth...so the total didn't add up.  More waiting.  The waitress was nice enough when we saw her, but made no effort to apologize for their foibles.  But back to the food.  The salsa was outstanding...my seafood enchiladas were suberb.  Because of the quality of the meal, I'm willing to give them another chance and hope that my first experience was just an aberration."}
{"text":"This place is ok if you are so starving you don't care what you eat. The chips and salsa are great, but everything else is pretty bland. I am a fan of tamales and I would definitely not order it again. They do make some pretty good chicken tacos, but you only receive 2 small tacos and its about $12... no thanks! I would prefer Taco Bell over Mi Amigos. The staff is very nice and the service is good, too bad the food does not match."}
{"text":"I had not eaten here in years well I soon  remembered why I only are here one time years ago. The service was very slow and seemed to be a lot of confusion on who had what area. When we finally placed our order it took a long time to get a drinks. The chips were not fresh at all the hot sauce and salsa laced flavor.  We ordered a cheese crisp to be an appetizer well guess what all our meal and the cheese crips all came out at one time. My beans had no flavor my burrito was enchilada Style and also was very bland no flavor at all. My wife's red burrito the meat was very tuff has lots of meat but tuff her taco was good. Needless to say the only thing that was good was the cheese crisp taco and our soda. We will not be back again."}
{"text":"Ate here with a group during Comicon.  I look at online menus ahead of time because I can take a long time deciding, especially if my first time. The item I asked for wasn't normally on this location's menu, however, they were able to still make me the meal!!!! Thank you soooooo much for the above and beyond service towards a \"tough customer\". It was not expected, but greatly appreciated!!!!"}
{"text":"I'm from Tucson originally, and I've been searching for a good Sonoran-style place for a while now.  This place is OK.  The menu is pretty much standard fare.  I got a chimichanga, enchilada-style, and it wasn't bad, but it just felt a little manufactured. In fact, the whole place has a manufactured feel to it.  It's just too chain-like.  The service was friendly, but I agree with the previous reviewer:  \"There's nothing really great and nothing really bad to say about this place.\""}
{"text":"So after our last failed attempt at On the Border I pulled up other Mexican places nearby and this one popped up. I knew I drove by it before but never paid attention. I am so glad we found this place!! We love sitting outside, which we could do here!! The food was great!! Our family greatly enjoyed their meals! I had the chicken enchiladas and the chicken was prime!! The rice was great! Hubby had fajita deluxe, everything was so fresh and handmade tortillas right there!! The steal, chicken and shrimp looked good on his plate too!! The chips and salsa they serve was good too!! Fresh chips and medium salsa. We will definitely be back here regularly! The service was great too!!  No complaints and we will not be returning EVER to On The Border!"}
{"text":"Stopped here for lunch at 1:00 pm last Thursday with my hubby and was seated promptly. Being vertically challenged, I was pleased that the booth bench was high in relation to the table level, but it certainly could have had a lot more cushion.    We were brought drinks, had orders took, and tortilla chips brought promptly. I really liked the chips. They were paper thin, very crispy, and were glistening with fresh, hot, fryer oil. The pico de gallo type salsa also tasted very fresh and home-made, but it could have done better with a few less chopped onion chunks in it. Upon request, we were also brought a bowl of more picante salsa, which had the flavor of roasted red chilies. Nice.  Our orders, both from the lunch menu, were also served quite quickly.  My husband had a cheese enchilada/chicken taco combo (~$6.25) which came with black beans (on request), rice, and a cabbage garnish. I didn't even see the taco since my husband devoured it so fast, but his enchilada was swimming in a mixture of cheese & red sauce which he said was pretty tasty.   I had a chicken enchilada (~$6.75). There were nice chunks of breast in there that actually tasted like chicken, unlike some other mexican joints where the meats all have the same texture & flavor. The enchilada was drizzled with a nice green chili sauce. The spanish rice was a little bit nondescript, but was more edible than some other restaurants'.  Mine was also served with black beans as requested, and a cabbage garnish. There were also more big chunks of onion in the garnish. I'm not an onion hater, don't get me wrong, but I'm sure after this feast, nobody would want to be within four feet of me. If I was on lunch break from one of the nearby offices, I'd probably request they go easy on the onions, lest I offend my work-mates back at the office.  Although I arrived with a huge appetite, I was stuffed after devouring everything on my plate. The service was very good. Our waitress was quite attentive and quick. The food was delicious. The prices were reasonable.  I'd go again."}
{"text":"Before a Suns game we were looking for a place to eat.  Chose this one and sat on the cute little patio at the Arizona Center.  Food was just 'ok' (I've definitely had better Mexican in the valley) but happy hour is GREAT with $2.50 margaritas that were quite tasty!  Try the Blue Amigo.  I see us coming back for drinks and snacks but not a full meal."}
{"text":"When it comes to mexican food its pretty hard to impress me. I'll try to be as fair as possible with this review though!  Food: The chips and salsa were free and unlimited. Very tasty! The salsa tasted fresh and homemade. I was glad for this. I pretty much stuffed my face on the chips which I rarely do so they must have been doing something right.  I shared a plate with my mother that came with two beef tacos and a cheese enchilada as well as beans and rice. My mother said the tacos were amazing. I hated my enchilada. It tasted...strange. The beans were really good but the rice wasn't very great. It kind of tasted old and like it was made from a box.   My boyfriend ordered a bean burrito and the tortilla tasted like it came out of a bag from a grocery store. I'm not talking Mission either, which is tolerable packaged tortillas. I'm talking store brand in Canada tortillas. I was seriously disappointed. If I were him I'd have just opened the burrito up and ate the beans right out of it because the beans were delicious.  My brother, grandfather, and father all enjoyed their meals. My brothers fajitas looked pretty impressive.  Margaritas were $2.50 during Happy Hour which is really nice. It was a good tasting margarita for the most part. I enjoyed it.   Service: The service was amazing. Our waiter was very attentive, funny, and polite. He made jokes with my parents and was just all around a really good server. I think my boyfriend might have had a little man crush on him. He definitely earned his tip.  Atmosphere: Not much to say here. It was really quiet for happy hour but then again it was a week night. I prefer quiet and relaxed to hustle and bustle so  I was pleased.  Price: Hmmmm.... A lot of people think mexican food should be cheap but I say if it's authentic or quality then a high price is justified (See also: Los Dos Molinos ;})  As for this place, the prices should all be knocked back a few bucks because the foods just okay.    I'll probably come back again for cheap margaritas during happy hour and a plate of beans with chips and salsa. Maybe I'll bring my own tortillas."}
{"text":"Casual location and good for a quick bite to eat.  Chips not too salty! Salsa has some kick to it.  I had enchiladas and they were pretty good.  Service was pretty good too.  Place got pretty crowded."}
{"text":"Bean dip was delicious, the tacos and enchilada combo were awesome and the service was quick and friendly. Definitely a great, quick spot worth trying for out of towners like myself."}
{"text":"Amazing place been going here since a little girl and this place has never let me and my family down. The food is always perfect service is always great. Today we went in Mother's Day and they passed out roses to all the mothers it was soooo nice very kind. The food was awesome we had the steak fajitas tasted great very flavorful came out sizzling. Delicious!!   Cleanliness- great everything was clean wiped down bathrooms where clean toilet paper in stalls very clean.  Staff- great very helpful kind and fast  This place is definitely on your bucket list for some amazing Mexican food!"}
{"text":"I wanted to try several things so I ordered the Sampler Combination Platter. Rice and beans were good but the 5 or so other items on the plate were horrific. Every item tasted exactly the same. I couldn't differentiate between them. They were all mostly gummy dough, miserly fillings and an underlying hint of old refrigerator taste. Never again."}
{"text":"Quick to be seated.  Good service.   Best food that I've had on this trip, but not so amazing that I have to come back."}
{"text":"Went here to kill time before a movie next door. It was pretty much the only option unless we wanted to walk a few blocks. We sat on the patio and ordered the happy hour Cadillac margaritas. Those are pretty good. Service was good also. We had nachos, which were just OK. The chicken was very moist and flavorful. Other than that, pretty boring. No pico, bland pinto bean dip, yellow cheese. Basically, if you just want to kill time and have some drinks before a movie, like we did, this is your spot. If you want real Mexican food, go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Chips and Salsa were decent. The Grilled Fish Tacos were really excellent. Price was reasonable."}
{"text":"Came here while on business travel.  The area in which the restaurant is located is currently under construction which makes things a little unpleasant in 100+ degree weather. The service was extremely slow although the place was far from busy. The food was mediocre which was surprising for a Mexican restaurant in Pheonix, Arizona where southwestern food is quite popular. I got chicken fajitas. The presentation was nice, but food tasted just ok. Chips and dip were blah- chips were cold and not very appealing. Sour cream is extra? Not impressed. Would only recommend if you want some average Mexican food."}
{"text":"This place needs to get their act together. We went there before the D'backs game. They were understaffed and you can hear people complaining about the service but we stayed anyway. The young man that took our order I don't think was even a server. He got every one of our orders wrong. Everything went back. I went to the restroom and I heard a server say to the bartender that they have never been so busy on a Saturday. What? This was 4:30 in the afternoon! Once we got our food nobody came by and asked how was everything. We needed our water refilled and I actually had to track down someone to get the refill. They offered us free fried ice cream for the inconvenience and we politely declined! Ugh! What mess this place is! Stay away, stay far away from this place!"}
{"text":"Service was awful. She only brought one meal because she thought we were sharing even though we each just ordered the same thing. This left us waiting until the 2nd arrived. Food was just ok. The check came and the server ruined my card getting ink from the broken pen all over it. Don't recommend this place there's definitely better Mexican food around."}
{"text":"I ate here twice during my stay in Phoenix last week and I can't say too many bad things about it. Prices were decent, food had flavor and it filled me up. Was it the best Mexican food I've ever had? Absolutely not, however it definitely wasn't nasty! The service was A-OK and the food hit the spot. I would definitely go back again."}
{"text":"I had the tostada and a side of black beans. This might sound crazy but those had to be the tastiest black beans I have ever had in my life. That raises it up a star. The service was fine, but those beans... Next time I might just go for a plate of beans."}
{"text":"*This is really a 2.5 star restaurant but it gets the benefit of the doubt for being the only Mexican restaurant in reasonable walking distance from my work downtown, can't believe there aren't more Mexican restaurants centered downtown*  I have only eaten here for lunch - they have decent chips and salsa (mix the regular salsa with their separate hot sauce salsa) and their lunch prices are probably average...slightly on the high side for Mexican lunch, in my opinion.  They have a blue margarita for $2.50...it's pretty sweet (not my favorite), but good value for a drink.    Service is usually good, typically they are attentive with drinks, chips, and bringing the bill.    If you remember the Matador downtown, this is a step down in all aspects of a resaurant except for maybe speed of service where it's a tie.  All in all - this is Phoenix, AZ.  You should not settle for mediocre Mexican food at above average prices, but for lack of options, this is an acceptable option."}
{"text":"went there for a working lunch with the marketing department. ordered a salad. started eating, it was okay- tasted like a crappy hooters chicken salad. THEN I NOTICED... a small pearly yellow orange bean looking thing in the salad. i poked it with my fork and then lifted it to my nose to smell it. IT WAS A CHEWED UP PEACH JELLY BELLY JELLYBEAN! IN MY SALAD! i was disgusted. told the waiter, showed it to him and he LAUGHED, as if that was a funny joke between buddies.   can you picture the fat lady in the back mixing up my salad and a chewed up jellybean from her bag falls into my plate and she just keeps going or doesn't notice?!?! i had to actually request that the salad be taken off of my bill - they were still going to charge me for it.  they offered nothing else, no manager came over to talk to me, nothing... as if it was just another customer complaint. lol NEVER GOING BACK THERE!"}
{"text":"Worst freaking Mexican food I've ever tasted! Ordered a torta and it was so simple. The bread wasn't even a torta bread! It only comes with the steak and cheese everything else like beans is extra cost. The service here was ridiculous. We were the only people in the restaurant and it took 35 min for our food. Servers didn't even come and ask us if we wanted refills on our drinks.  Sucky sucky place!"}
{"text":"This was the worst Mexican restaurant I have ever. The grilled shrimp that my wife ordered were      Tasteless and not grilled. She threw up later that night. My daughter ordered the chicken burrito and it tasted like chicken pot pie, the one you get from the supermarket. Who can mess up a burrito. Even Taco Bell can do a better job. And the worst service ever."}
{"text":"Way I figure it if  A RESTAURANT HAS A BEAUTIFUL, TALENTED AND CHARMING young lady like SADIE....working there and she's smiling it has to be good for you..........yep lots of cruelty-free foods (vegan) and it smells good.......THIS IS THE place to be today!!!!!"}
{"text":"My family and I ate here last night for dinner. I couldn't wait to have some queso but they don't have queso. The salsa was pretty spicy. It had a decent taste but it was very runny. The chips weren't very good. For dinner I had steak tacos. They were what you would expect. My son had the beef tacos on the kids menu. The taco shell was so greasy he couldn't eat it. He ended up taking the filling out and putting it into my extra corn tortillas and eating it that way.   Even though the food was nothing to write home about, our server was very kind. We did have to ask for things but she was so sweet that it was ok."}
{"text":"My husband and I decided to try this place for happy hour since our apartment complex listed this in a blog as being recommended for their chips and salsa.   Maybe it was just this location but it seemed super dumpy to us. My husband referred to it as the Waffle House of Mexican food.   I have had better salsa out of a jar from the grocery store, so I have no idea what the blog writer was talking about. My margarita was ok. We tried the pork taquitos and They tasted like the frozen ones from a store. The best part of the meal was that my husband's beer was cheap."}
{"text":"Stopped here yesterday for lunch and the food and service we both excellent. I had Fish Tacos and my wife ordered a Chimichanga. The chips and salsa we are always being filled without asking."}
{"text":"Have been to this restaurant more times than I can count. I seriously love this place. Everything I have tried, I have liked,  but hands down my favorites are the crispy beef tacos, the green corn tamales and the mini chimis. Great foood, great service. Try it and you will not be dissappointed!"}
{"text":"The service here is what gets it 3 stars.  However, the food itself is kind of mehh.  I had the chimichanga and it was slightly over fried.  It came with rice and beans, which were also slightly disappointing.  The dessert was phenomenal, though.  Fried ice cream and flan.  The flan was amazing, the fried ice cream came in vanilla caramel chocolate and strawberry.  Very, very good.  The prices are also decent and again, the service is amazing."}
{"text":"Normally come here in March during Spring Training for beers. Came here for dinner tonight as we are staying close by. Enchiladas were delicious! Hubby had Carnitas Yucatán and loved it. Sorry no Pics! We ate it too fast!"}
{"text":"We ate here last night and we were very disappointed.  The salsa for some reason is never the same and this time the tomatoes tasted like canned.  My veggie chimi is normally good but this time they used only the stems of the mushroom and it made it taste funny.  Who uses only stems??  That shows they are doing it cheap instead of good.     My iced tea was very weak, there was almost no flavor. Again being cheap.   My husband and i both decided last night to find another americanized mexican restaurant to eat at."}
{"text":"All mexican restaurants need to be evaluated on two levels - how's the food and how's the margaritas.  And if the second one rates anything above 'fantastic', the rating on the former matters not. I should really end the review here and now by telling you that the margaritas at Mi Amigos were exsquisite.  We would have asked for to go cups and grabbed one for the road were such things permissable.  Everything else about the place was good as well.  Not overly expensive, service was fine, the outdoor patio was nice - even if we were subjected to the oldies radio blaring from the Uno's patio next door. My shredded beef burro was a little dry and not spicy enough for my taste, but it was still more than servicable.  And let's be honest, no spice and stale tortillas couldn't keep me away from this place's tasty concoctions.  Viva la margarita!"}
{"text":"Salsa was pretty good, food was average. Strawberry Margarita is good tasting but had no alcohol, the blue Margarita was better."}
{"text":"Usually like this place but today the food and service were both off. The kids meals were inedible. The ma'am get took them off our bill but then added on the cost of a kids soda (which was included in the cost of the kids meal). Tacky move. I won't be back to this location!"}
{"text":"The food here is pretty good, but the service is horrible! Me,my wife and son went into this business a few days ago to eat supper after we were seated they said that someone would be right with us, well after 15 minutes nobody! Acknowledged us saying \" be right with you\" or anything. Now remember this is the third time in a row that the service has been horrible. The first time that it happened, everyone's due for a bad day and even the second time but all three times horrible service that is unacceptable especially when I'm paying my hard-earned money in their establishment to have good service and good food. so me and my family left and will never return."}
{"text":"So so...  We went in excited for Mexican food. Really excited for lunch. The moment we walked in the energy was off by the employees. They were the farthest thing from friendly. \"Here, sit there\" and throws menus onto the table and walks away.   The soup was luke warm. The chimichanga was bland. Still better than Taco Bell or Del Taco. Our stomachs were full. When I asked for a new hot temped soup, you would have thought I had slapped the server in the face, which was not my intent.   I hope we just caught them on a very bad day."}
{"text":"My family and I have been dining at Mi Amigo's for so many years.  They used to have a ton of locations, but for some reason or another, they have closed all but this one as far as I know.  I am a huge fan of their salsa.  I love the big chunks of onion and tomato and it's the right amount of heat.  I also really like the Nacho's Mi Amigo's with Machaca.  It may not be called that anymore, but that's what I've always called it when ordering.  There is a lot of juicy beef and almost every chip is covered with goodness.  The rest of the menu is plain old Americanized Mexican food and is nothing spectacular, so I stick with the reliable nachos."}
{"text":"I grew up going to Mi Amigo's with my family so it is a bit of a nostalgic experience for me.  I noticed that they menu was different than I remember on our most recent visit.  My favorite thing has always been the Nachos Mi Amigo's with machaca.  They had nachos, but I didn't want to order them because they weren't described on the menu like they used to be.  My hubby got a chicken chimi and stopped eating it halfway through because the chicken had a strange texture.  His beans were also lukewarm.  The salsa is totally amazing, but you can't go to a restaurant solely for the salsa!"}
{"text":"Good prices for happy hour, appetizers and drinks.  Service is average, food is average as well.  Good spot if just want something to eat and you are in the area."}
{"text":"Service was okay. Drinks: Brought lemon with my drink when I asked for lime. Soda had little to no carbonation. Food: Platter #1- Did not bring the platter as ordered and had to send it back. Too much sauce on the enchilada made it too soggy to eat. Taco had maybe a table spoon of beef in it. I didn't realize the tostada was just a bean tostada (no meat.) Platter #2- chicken with shrimp was good.  Served part of the husk with the tamale (why?)  Rice and beans cooked well but bland. Servers were attentive but didn't communicate well with each other ( asked for our order twice- wasn't sure who our server was.) Served American cheese with the food- is this Taco Bell? Where was the Queso Fresco? Crumbling Cheese? Ever heard of V & V Supremo? You can order online! Price was way more than expected or worth it. Won't be visiting again."}
{"text":"The staff is wonderful!  The pork carnitas were amazing. Margarita damn. They got the job done"}
{"text":"Don't eat here when it's busy. We are in town for a convention and the line was out the door so we were expecting a short wait. Instead they seated us immediately so we were happy with that! Except we sat down and no one even fretted us and we didn't get a glass of water. Finally after about 30 minutes we just got up and left. If you sit people you must have the ability to serve them! If we would have been told when checking in that there was a 30-45 minutes wait we could have made an informed decision to either wait or go to one of the other restaurants in the area! Thanks for the dehydration and sunburn!"}
{"text":"So food is not very impressive. The only thing I truly look forward to is the chili reno which is half decent. Chips and salsa is pretty good. Not that great, if my wife family didn't go all the time I would never be back."}
{"text":"I'm visiting Phoenix and Mi Amigo's is in the complex across from my hotel. Since I am in Arizona I thought I'd get some quality Mexican food. It was pretty good, but not great. They do have awesome chips and salsa.  The good thing about the visit was that I was in a rush and ordered take out. The hostess was swift and got us our food in under 10 minutes. She was friendly and efficient, which happened to be just what I was looking for."}
{"text":"Amazing prices, amazing food, amazing margaritas! I'm the biggest judge when it comes to margaritas and I have to say that this margaritas are great! The happy hour is fantastic $2.50margaritas!! Tonight I'm trying the seafood enchilada and is really really good! Def coming back here!"}
{"text":"I have had two unfortunate experiences at this particular restaurant. The 1st, mostly service related and cold food. Tonight, however, deserves mentioning. We waited for over 10 minutes before being acknowledged at our table and in fact had two tables seated and ordered before we had water. I am very forgiving if the place is busy, but this was not the case. Food was marginal, waiter apologetic. But, my biggest complaint was the bathroom. It was gross and I am truly hopeful that the employees have their own bathroom with readily available soap. As the picture may not show, the soap in the opened container is watered down. It appears as though it had not been cleaned for awhile, and according to the log, it had been over 2 days. Yuck."}
{"text":"We have eaten here many time and the food is usually good. Today it was horrible. Everything was cold. Cheese was not even melted in my sins burrito. My food was very greased and cold."}
{"text":"As a native Southern Californian, I was looking forward to some good Mexican food during a recent business trip to Phoenix.  Mis Amigos in Arizona Center was a covnenient choice for lunch downtown.  It was a late lunch (like 1:30) so the place was mostly empty and the hostess didn't seem too pleased to see us.  She brushed off my charming jokes and sat us in a nearby booth.  The hostess was actually the downside of the service - everyone else was quite prompt and pleasant.  Unfortunately, the service was the best aspect of our lunch at Mis Amigos.  Before ordering the carne asada torta, I asked the server if it was good and she insisted it was.  What came out of the kitchen was warmed-over, chopped steak on a sub roll - not the soft, authentic torta roll I was expecting.  Other than \"carne asada sauce\" there was nothing else on the sandwich - no guacamole, no tomato, no nothing.  Disappointing.  The tableside guacamole was also disappointing.  Even though the waitress prepared it - as you would expect - tableside, it was bland.  The guac definitely needed salt, maybe a little lemon or lime juice, but something to give it some flavor.  Maybe I was expecting too much, but I certainly wouldn't recommend Mis Amigos to mis amigos."}
{"text":"Good for Drinks; only.  Ordered dinner I could have made fresher at home, old dry rice, not to mention it was over priced. I ordered guacamole, it tasted old. I told the waitress, in which she replied, it's made fresh every morning, which could have been true, but it was 4 pm.... Don't waste your time and money."}
{"text":"Personally, I like Mi Amigo's, but the general consensus seems to be that it's just OK.  The reason I give it 4 stars is because every time I come here I have a good experience. The food is always good, the drinks are good (especially happy hour drinks), the staff is friendly, it's never too busy or crowded.  I really like their enchiladas, but some of their food is a little \"Americanized\". For example, their chicken quesadillas are literally just chicken and cheese. Most authentic Mexican places I go to put in pepper jack or onions into their quesadillas. But like I said, that doesn't really bother me because the food is still awesome.  Also, if you park in the AZ Center parking garage, they WILL validate your parking :)  It's nothing fancy or special, but for a generic Mexican restaurant their food and drinks are really good. Friendly staff too. Would recommend it to anyone!"}
{"text":"Horrible service!!! Food is less than average and the additional charge for the large group room is ridiculous!!! My very large family, that has hosted large parties there several times a year will NEVER go back!!!"}
{"text":"Dinner for 4 Saturday night. Was not busy at all. Food was average. I had the carne asada burrito, it was good. Rice was dry. The margarita wasn't great, lemony but didn't taste like a margarita. Won't be back."}
{"text":"It has been almost a year since I've been here, I didn't like it last time. However I was pleasantly surprised this time and enjoyed my enchilada and chicken taco. The taco felt very light and fresh and not greasy. I will go back"}
{"text":"The awnings said \"Mexican Grill,\" but the food screamed: \"Eat here, White Tourists with no tolerance for spice.\" Everything lacked flavor. The salsa was a runny, watery mess served with chips from a bag (is so it seems). The carnitas came devoid of any vegetables and a side of white, sticky rice. The biggest disappointment was the bland margarita; it was all sweet-and-sour mix without a kick. This doesn't even come close to passing as Mexican food. For the price, I could've had a nice steak dinner."}
{"text":"2.5/5 potential  i think they have good ideas. or maybe i ordered the wrong thing. i got this chicken parmesan type dish, only made mexican style. it came with a well cooked spaghetti in a bright cilantro pesto, the the chicken was sauced with chipotle rather than marinara. then it came with a small side salad and avocado. pretty decent, no?  problem is the chicken wasn't well cooked, it was kinda burnt and dry, the pasta was a little too salty, etc. i also tried a taco and it was greasy and the shell was kinda stale.   anyways, i think the ideas here are good, just need better execution."}
{"text":"One of the better Mexican restaurants I've been to.  I go there for lunch, and you can get a good one for less than $10.  Being downtown Phoenix, that is saying something."}
{"text":"If you are a tourist, this is not \"authentic\" az mexican food, but will hit the spot.  We usually get the lunch flauta plate.  Good Deal for A-OK Eats."}
{"text":"The food is OK...nothing special, but not bad.  Went there today in the mood for a ground beef burrito.  Guess what they don't serve here?  Ground beef.  So, I ended up getting the fish taco lunch meal.  The \"fish\" looked and tasted like a regular old fish stick from the grocery store...tasted ok, nothing wrong with it.  The sides...corn and rice...weren't wonderful.  Both were pretty dried out, especially the corn.  Really wanted a ground beef burrito.  The'r priced are WAY too high for what you get.  $8 for 1 fish stick taco, a small scoop of corn and a small scoop of rice just seemed a lot for a lunch \"special\".  Thank goodness for the chips and salsa!  On a positive note, though...the staff was really nice and friendly.  I'll give them kudos for that!"}
{"text":"One star for the tainted reviews.   Orange head liars, nice touch to have all of the employees give rave reviews.   You gets nothing!!!!!   The real scoop... the chips were to greasy and too salty our server was a trout mouthed heathen that needed a bath. You would have thought she was at home the way she shuffled across the floor. We left before she could come back and take our order. Nasty. The food might be good but our server drove us away."}
{"text":"Came here looking to try a different Mexican food restaurant , and we will keep looking ... Food wasn't bad , it was tasty ( as in chain restaurant food tasty) it missed the mark as far as authentic flavors go . The prices are higher than they should be . There are 7? Lunch specials to chose from all priced at $8.99- there are TONS of Mexican restaurants just waiting to be discovered and discover them we shall"}
{"text":"Pretty dang good sopapillas and the orange bbq pulled pork was good, but a little dry. This place is looking run down & needs an update. What used to be an old family favorite is now becoming a last resort though. Decent service, alright menu, meh..."}
{"text":"Came here for a late dinner and was indeed impressed. Really enjoyed the quiet dinner, the service was awesome our server was very pleasant and welcoming. The menu is very simple but my food was very tasty and full of flavor. If the enchiladas at a Mexican restaurant are not good i will not be back. There green chili enchiladas are great and can make changes if you need to. My server understood what we wanted and made it happen. The menu doesn't do its justice, you have to be there and taste the food.  Sopapillas are excellent dessert, again meets my taste buds and im sure it will meet yours too. Will i be back, no questions asked. My favorite Spanish dish and favorite dessert. I love great service and great food and i found an awesome place to go."}
{"text":"Nothing too fancy or exciting. I ordered a torta and wasn't impressed the only positive was the chips and salsa other than that I would stay away."}
{"text":"We went to Mi Amigos because it was not as busy as our favorite, Rancho De Tia Roas's on Friday night. That was a bit of a mistake.  The food was mediocre at best. They began by bringing us chips and salsa. The chips that they bring out are gigantic. Seriously much too big to actually eat. The salsa wasn't bad.  Then the actual food looked pretty decent, but the taste was nothing remarkable. My wife enjoyed her rice and beans, but the actual burrito she ordered was hardly touched.  I found the carne asada in my chimichanga to be tasty, and I ate the entire meal because I was famished.  We will probably not go here again unless circumstances require us to."}
{"text":"Where this isn't the gourmet Mexican fiesta heaven you're probably just dying to try. It wasn't re-fried bean heck either. The atmosphere leaves a lot to be desired, it's very typical American Grill meets what it thinks Mexico should look like complete with booths and tacky wall colors.  But they will make semi-fresh guacamole at your table and bring you a mountain of chips that you can't refuse.   They were also pretty knowledgeable about what was gluten free on their menu. Stay away from the yellow rice, but try the white, it's delicious."}
{"text":"Restaurant is cute. Service was good. The food is overpriced. My cheese enchiladas were very skimpy on the cheese. The enchilada sauce was straight out of a can. Beans were good. Iced tea was weak. My companion's chimichanga was pretty small and it was 12 bucks. The best thing was the chips, as they appeared to be homemade. Salsa was decent, but made of all canned goods. As we were leaving my companion said, \"That was a 20 dollar meal, not a 30 dollar meal.\" I was thinking the exact same thing.  It was OK but not great. Way overpriced. Good place to take someone who doesn't know what real Mexican food tastes like."}
{"text":"Better than expected from reviews. Add a shot of tequila to margaritas is definitely the play. Menu has some flair. I thought the food and salsa not at all bland albeit a bit salty. Service was substandard."}
{"text":"It does not get better then this as far as Mexican food is concerned.  I love the tacos here more then anything.  Anything on the menu is amazing, but the sampler plate is the most amazing out of all they offer.  You get the best of everything!  Friendly and fun place to take the whole family for some amazing Mexican food!"}
{"text":"Simply the best Tacos you can find around here. They use real shells, not the crappy taco bell style shells. Great enchalda sauce and amazing machaca chimis. I love this place and always have had good service.  The salsa is fresh and tastes great.  I have been a ton of times and never had a bad experience.  I have been eating at Mi Amigos since I was a little kids - so at least 30 years!"}
{"text":"Don't recommend this place at all. Pick a different place unless you are just going for their happy hour deals which are extremely cheap! Felt that this was very generic. Go to another place."}
{"text":"Not the best mexican food ever but not bad.  I had the ceviche tacos which were surprisingly full of shrimp and scallops for the price.  It's close by work so can't complain.  But if you want authenticity, not the place. But still good."}
{"text":"sh÷× hole with very kind employees.  The food is just not edible.  Cheap alcohol is the only way they will stay open or replace the menu."}
{"text":"My 1st n last visit. If you have a hearty appetite, stay away! For $11.95 I had 2 pork enchiladas n I only counted 6 small pieces of meat in each enchilada. Also about 2 tablespoons of beans n a small scoop of rice. I was still hungry n the end :("}
{"text":"Best salsa in Phoenix!    I love Mi Amigo's!  The salsa and chips are always fresh and there's always plenty of it on your table.  I tried almost everything and it's all good.  But my favorite is the chicken chimichanga or mini chimi platter - so delicious!"}
{"text":"After paying to park at the weak excuse of a mall that this place is located in we figured we might as well at least try to get our parking moneys worth so we stopped in and ordered up a couple margaritas to ease the pain of being bamboozled. I've definitely had better drinks and I've definitely had worse. Can't speak for the food here but I definitely wouldn't be running back for happy hour or any other hour for that matter to throw one back."}
{"text":"Good food. Friendly service. Tacks and chips were really good. Red chile burrito was only ok. Ill try something else next time im in town."}
{"text":"Every trip I make to Phoenix and stay downtown I plan at least one meal here. The green corn tamales are my favorite. And the home made salsa is to die for. A great happy hour and friendly staff makes for great casual dinning. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"It has been about 15 years since I've been here. When we stopped going (it is very close to us) the food quality had gone down so much that we saw no reason to go back. But our son decided that it would be a nice place to meet for a meal and said it was pretty good. So we went. I was pleasantly surprised with the updated menu and happier still that they still had their yummy Carnitas cooked in citrus. Once I got it I was immediately impressed. In the past it had become so fatty that I stopped ordering it. But these Carnitas were so much better. Nice and lean, super tender with lots of flavor. I was in Heaven. Even better it came with corm instead of rice. What a nice change. All in all it was a very good meal. The Salsa they gave us was very good and the chips were fresh and hot. All in all I was very impressed. The food now is far better than my last visit and to be honest about it. The food is better than I can ever remember. And I remember food."}
{"text":"I have been here a few times and enjoy it. It is close to my apartment and the service is always fast & friendly. I typically order the same thing each time - the Tamaco Special: one taco and one tamale with rice and beans. The tamale is excellent and I highly recommend it. They also have a blue amigo margarita. In a pint glass. For $2.50. Whaaaatttt?!?!  I went Saturday afternoon arrived, ordered, ate, and was back home in 30 minutes. The food is always good and I continue to visit. They do have a good-sized menu and I should try some other things, but I really enjoy the Tamaco Special too much to venture away."}
{"text":"We were running short on time for a show at the Herberger across the street and were counting on Corner Bakery being open for a quick dinner. It wasn't, but this was the next closest place.  In hindsight, I wish we would've eaten at Subway.  I'm a vegetarian and while I understand that lard is used in beans often and chicken stock is used to make rice, does it really have to be used to fry the chips? (Spoiler: it is here. They guy told me, but not before I figured it out for myself)  I tasted one and immediately knew. It leaves a film on your tongue that's just so gross. They were not good.  I had a vegetarian burrito (they have a white rice and black bean alternative, so that was nice). It was absolutely mediocre. I wanted enchiladas but didn't trust the sauce, so stuck with the burrito.  My husband had some combo and my kids split an appetizer quesadilla that came with a small garnish of cabbage but not the usual suspects of a dollop of sour cream, guacamole or salsa.   The water tasted odd even. The only thing I can definitely say in their favor is that they were so speedy with service. We were in an hurry and because they weren't busy, we were in and out in a flash. The service was totally fine.  It was our fault for not leaving enough time for an adequate dinner, but it hurt to spend $37 on food we didn't even really like and had to consume in 25 minutes total."}
{"text":"Just ok..happy hour anywhere in the restaurant which is nice. HappyHour menu nothing exciting....$ 2,50 items. Probably won't return"}
{"text":"My waitress was truly a wonderful person! I was a little grumpy from being hungry, but she made me smile. We talked about our tattoos and I should of asked her to go to first Friday with me.  Sure the food was just okay and over priced for what it was, but she made it great.  Peace!"}
{"text":"November 2015  I have eaten at this established on several occasions - for lunch and dinner with friends, solo, and with family. I have dined inside and on their patio.  The food is superb, the decor is bright and has Spanish/Central American influence, and the service is good.  They totally get the lunch rush and make sure you are fed in a timely manner, food is hot when you get it, and your check is given to you when asked.  Dinner is more slow paced, relaxed, and you can sit and enjoy the ambiance."}
{"text":"The service was so terrible. We waited over 15 minutes to give our drink order, and the waiter ran off before we could tell him that we were obviously ready to give our requests.    The small menu did not make it difficult to decide - this place has very few selections and not many traditional Mexican favorites. After the long wait to give our order, we decided to split the nachos. Seems simple enough, right? Not a chance.   After waiting for what felt like ages (noticing a theme here?), the greasy nachos were placed in front of us. We tried to stomach the soggy chips and stale beans, but could barely finish half. There wasn't even salt on the table to make the complimentary chips bearable!  Needless to say, we will not be returning."}
{"text":"Excellent Fajitas, Yummy chips and Salsa also loved the  Bean dip"}
{"text":"This restaurant is absolutely horrible. There is a huge conference in town. My colleague and I went to this restaurant for dinner about 6pm, which should be the peak of dinner service. We walked in, and it was fairly empty. There was no host/hostess to seat us. It took about 10 mins for someone to show up. My colleague and I ordered the shrimp tacos, which were very underwhelming in taste and was not appealing to the eyes. Additionally, we asked for sour cream on the side, which is a typical condiment for a Mexican restaurant. The waitress did not indicate it was extra for the sour cream, so we were shocked to see the charges on our bills ($1.75 each). She also brought out 2 small bowls of sour cream before she brought out our meals. The customer service was highly lacking. Skip this place. Save your money and your taste buds. I'd give it zero stars if I could. 1 star is generous."}
{"text":"Poor food. Horrible canned salsa. Tiny portions. Outrageous prices. Empty restaurant.  That pretty much sums up this sad excuse for a Mexican restaurant. What's really disappointing is this place was fantastic and busy just five years ago."}
{"text":"Not a bad Mexican place for lunch and not too badly priced for downtown Phoenix area. I have been there twice and not disappointed."}
{"text":"A friend of mine really likes this place.. so I've been here several times .. the service is definitely a 5star .. the hostess and the waitstaff are all super friendly and accommodating.. chips and salsa also rank high .. drinks never run low..  It was pretty empty on today's visit.. the food is just so average .. not flavorful or authentic.. I ordered from the lunch menu the chicken chimi with rice & beans.. the plate arrived and it was super hot but the inside of the chimi was cold.. a chimi is fried, the inside should not be cold. . The flavor was just ok.. rice and beans also just ok.  My friend thinks the chorizo breakfast  burrito is really good, I thought it was ok. Nothing to run to Mesa to enjoy."}
{"text":"This place is okay. Its not disgusting. My rolled tacos were actually good and so were the beans. My margarita was not good though. Its not authentic and its definitely casual dining, almost fast food like."}
{"text":"The weather was muy caliente.  Mi padre y mi esposa were mucho thirsty and in need of cervezas frias! This place quenched our thirst and sated our hunger pangs as well with their grande chips y salsa which were muy delicioso! And it was happy hour to boot, which was good because our cervezas cost us fewer pesos! Muy bueno! I glanced at the menu, and it was overwhelmingly huge with lots to choose from.  But since our primary reason for stopping was to cool off on a hot Phoenix afternoon, we'll have to come back at a later date to try the food."}
{"text":"I had dinner here and felt very ill afterward. I had the chicken enchilada and an unsweetened ice tea. I was sick within 40mins after eating there.  On the plus side, service was very good and they were very friendly."}
{"text":"Disappointing Mexican dining experience. Had more authentic Mexican food in MN. Ordered a burrito with nothing in it but a thick chicken broth and chicken.....Nothing else. The refried beans and rice were ok but arrived to the table cold. Service was slow and no offer for refills on drink, salsa or chips. First time and last time dining here."}
{"text":"Mediocre at best. People/service was fine. Food was not great. Red salsa was good. Shrimp taco: not very good. Overall, a disappointment. Cadillac margarita was good."}
{"text":"I was so excited that you were one of the few places that served menudo today. I picked up my to go order and was extremely disappointed by the amount I was served given the price I paid. My small cup wasn't even filled up and most was broth. The 4 spoonfuls of actual menudo were tasty but I won't pay $7 for 4 spoonfuls again. Plus you didn't serve it with bread! Come on now! Every Mexican place and home served menudo with bread or tortilla..."}
{"text":"Skip this place.   Prefab food that tastes like nothing  Just finished a chimi that had zero taste. Zero.  Lots of good places to eat here. Go to one of them Instead.  Service was maybe just ok."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying that this struck me as a very white-washed mexican food restaurant. In other words, intended for the typical white American who is unfamiliar with quality mexican faire.  I appreciated the provision of chips and salsa, and the gentleman who brought them was VERY considerate and kind to have brought individual salsa cups for each of the five of us.  But it was like pulling teeth to get more.  I ordered the pork taquitos from the appetizer menu. $6.25 for six cigarette sized items that were undoubtedly frozen ten minutes prior.  The items that others at the table ordered appeared to be tasty, and one fellow patron literally cleared the plate.  If I were in the area with out of town guests who wanted mexican, and they were not well versed in the faire, I'd take them here.  Otherwise we'd go elsewhere."}
{"text":"Pretty generic food.  The bean dip was advertised as spicy but we found it to be very bland.  Thankfully it was happy hour and our food was discounted, otherwise I would have regretted the trip."}
{"text":"Their food is average.. mainly come Here is because it's my fiancé and his family to go to Mexican restaurant.. their service is always great, no complaints.."}
{"text":"Great food!  Chips home made as is all the food.  Loved the enchiladas! Others in the restaurant loved their taco salad,  fajitas,  & tacos. Really good when strangers tell you how good their food is."}
{"text":"The first time I came, the food was OK. Cheap margaritas won me over. I was in the mood for cheap margaritas again tonight. I called to ask about parking. I got someone (a guy) really rude on the phone: Person: [pickes up the phone and listens without saying anything...] Me: \"hello?\" Person: \"yeah?\" Me: \"um... is this the restaurant?\" Person: \"yeah\" Me: [.....]  Then the person hangs up. Killed my desire to go there tonight and killed my desire to ever return for mediocre food. Gonna give another mexican place my business tonight. They get two stars for having cheap margarita.  *I changed from 2 to 3 stars because someone from the restaurant did try to contact me here on yelp and also because when I was there again in January, we had a good experience."}
{"text":"The one thing I loved about Mi Amigo's was the atmosphere there. I imagined under different circumstances, I actually wouldn't mind going out on a date with my husband there. I had a salad for lunch, with a piece of chicken on it. the dressing was good, salad was good, but a bit pricey for just a salad and a few chunks of chicken.  the waitress was friendly and accurate with the meal. They have a full sized bar that wasn't active at all with people in the mid afternoon, I imagine the real party starts at night. the restaurant was pretty empty at mid afternoon, which surprised me. I guess people are avoiding a pricey lunch? I would definitely go back one of these days though! great place if you need to have a business lunch to talk."}
{"text":"I was attending a conference at a nearby hotel and wandered in for lunch one day. I had a chicken burrito that left me disappointed: cubes of white chicken meat in a watery green sauce that had little flavor and no heat, wrapped in a non-descript tortilla, with rice and beans.  Service was good, price was reasonable, but the food wasn't even remotely interesting and that's a pity."}
{"text":"One of the most disgusting restaurants I've ever eaten at. I was on a business trip in Phoenix on decided to stop in for some Mexican food. The place was bad news from the very beginning.  The hostess was super unfriendly and looked as if she couldn't wait to get home. When I sat down at the table, a couple of bugs fell onto the table from the lamp shade overhead-- I should have gotten up then.  The chips were greasy, margaritas straight sugar w/ very little liquor and the enchiladas bland as can be. In addition to this, I got food poisoning and was up all night running to the bathroom.  You couldn't pay me to go back to this restaurant. It should be closed down immediately for its lack of cleanliness and poorly prepared food."}
{"text":"Great service, ok food, average chips and salsa.   FOOD  The chips and salsa are very average. Large tortilla chips and a pretty mild salsa with huge tomatoes in it.  I've had tacos, enchiladas, burritos and cheese quesos here. As pointed out in a previous review, the food here is very Americanized Mexican food. Everything is pretty bland and mild for Mexi-food. Bean and rice are your stereotypical refried bean and orange Mexi rice. The cheeses are a little greasy.   SERVICE  Our waitress was fantastic. She gets 5 stars. We had plenty of chips and salsa, and our drinks were never empty. She was friendly but not overly pushy.   AMBIANCE  If you're looking for quiet and romantic, don't come here. The restaurant is very open and the acoustics are awful. The decor is simple with Mexican flare, but not terribly gaudy.   OVERALL Great place for a quick downtown lunch if you don't mind Americanized Mexi-food that could be cheaper."}
{"text":"Well we decided to give this place a try.  Now I wish I had looked at yelp first. First off the place looks nice. My first impression is that this place has absolutely no food smells. Very strange for a Mexican Food place. Salsa is chunky watered down and blah. Chips hard and stale. So far not looking promising. I ordered a shredded beef buro and my wife is having the Carne Asada chimi. The menu is extremely basic with nothing special going on other than the high prices for medium to small portions. Both of our food tastes pre made and microwaved. The chimi was not crispy for having been deep fried recently.  This food is not Freshly made its old and very odd. My tortilla is doughy.  Refried beans were old tasting and rice dried out badly. I have eaten Mexican all over the USA and into Mexico. This is the kind of bad food expected from Northern Maine at a place run by a Chinese family who has never eaten Mexican food before. Actually that place might taste better. One last thought. my buro reminder me of eating a frozen buro as a kid but eating it after it has thawed out. You know the white doughy rubbery buro Yum Yum"}
{"text":"I had the shredded pork burrito and bought it was flavorful. The service was polite. Convenient to the Convention center and Sheraton. For a quick bite when you are adjusting to time zone change!"}
{"text":"SUPER FAST service. We only had 45 minutes to eat and were in and out of there in just over a half an hour. Shrimp fajitas - perfectly seasoned, large shrimp. The onions and peppers had a good char on them and were still sizzling when they got to me. The refried beans were flavorful. The house salsa is chunky and fresh and the waitress kept it coming. Good happy hour drinks and prices as well."}
{"text":"This place is WAY too outdated. I am really surprised they can afford to be in a downtown-ish location. They weren't busy when we walked in on a Friday evening. And, their prices are crazy for the non-ambiance they create. I can pay $20+ for fajitas in a nicer, more inviting setting. I'm shocked if college students (or anyone, really) patronize this place much unless they offer half off meal specials- eek!  We reviewed the menu ahead of time on their website and when we actually visited (after a 30 minute drive) we were disappointed they didn't offer what we intended to order. We left- if the setting is lacking and quite dated, I don't want to know how the food tastes.   The best thing about this place was the friendly and pleasant staff."}
{"text":"Came upon this place on accident and since I'm a lover of Mexican food, thought I'd give it a try.   Overall thoughts are that I should've kept driving. Was not busy at all, 5:30 on a Thursday night.  Server seemed annoyed to have to work, and even more annoyed that I sat in his station.  I ordered a combo of shredded beef taco, cheese enchildada, and bean tostada.  The food was cold when it came out.  The tostada was literally a giant hunk of lettuce on top of a soggy cold tortilla.  I would've sent it back, however the server never came back.  When I attempted to get his attention, he (seemingly) pretended not to see me and kept walking.   The only reason I'm giving this place 2 stars was because of the chips and salsa.  The salsa had good flavor (although no spice at all) and the chips were good.  I asked for hot salsa and even the hot was more \"very mild\" than hot.  But the flavor was very good.   All in all, I wouldn't give them a second chance.  And mostly because the manager saw me sitting at the table and he never stopped by to find out how things were either.  So, I guess the wait staff follows the lead of management."}
{"text":"Not sure the food could be considered authentic. BUT, the carnitas yucitan were exactly what I wanted.   They were very tasty with a perfect amount of spicy.   Service was ok, and chips an salsa were average."}
{"text":"Ordered chicken fajitas and chips and guacamole to go, got home and there were no tortillas, sour cream or anything but rice and chicken in the fajita box and got no guacamole. Paid $34 for rice and chicken. They said they will refund my money, but what a waste of time. Go somewhere else."}
{"text":"This place has great happy hour deals for their food and drinks! It goes from 3-6pm, they don't have a huge happy hour selection but their food was good nonethless. Does not satisfy me since I am a San Diego local and isn't close to what I love mexican food to be."}
{"text":"The prices are the only thing keeping this from being a 5.  Their service is scary fast and perfectly attentive.  This place is a favorite of everybody I work with.  I just had the fajitas this last time.  I don't know if I'll ever order anything else.  It was SO GOOD.  It could feed two people easily!  I might have ordered something made for two people.  I'm kinda embarrassed.  I didn't finish it though.  I couldn't.  I haven't found an issue with any of their food, and the cheap margaritas make a late lunch into a more enjoyable experience."}
{"text":"(Let me preface this review by saying that, being from Houston, I'm accustomed to eating authentic salsa, tacos, tamales, etc. My taste for Mexican food is most likely biased to a certain method or seasoning used around here.)   My waitress was quick to take my drink order once I was seated, and was attentive and sweet. I drank a \"Blue Amigo\", their house marg that is $2.50 all day every day. It was a bit sweet for my taste, but still okay.   Chips were great, but their \"salsa\" is what I know as pico de gallo. Luckily, I love pico, so it was all good.   On to the food - I ordered the Número Tres, which is 2 beef or chicken tacos (I chose beef), rice, beans, and a cheese enchilada. First impression...this place makes a mean cheese enchilada. Like, GOOOOD. Their red gravy was probably the best I've ever had. Rice, delicious. Refried beans, amazing. Beef tacos...yuck. I can't help but think that the beef in these tacos tasted like dog food smells. It was more of a shredded beef...bland...and just had an overall odd taste. I only ate about 3/4 of a taco and called it a night. I'm used to well-seasoned ground beef tacos, and these were just bizarre, in my opinion.   Overall, great place! I would visit again next time I'm in Phoenix, bull I'll probably stay away from the beef."}
{"text":"Went here just before a movie. The service was fast but that's it. I ordered the mango and shrimp quesadilla. My friend ordered nachos. The food was not good. I and my friend could not finish our food and we had stomach aches immediately after."}
{"text":"This isn't the best Mexican food I've had but it was ok with me. The restaurant is located in Arizona Center making it convinient to downtown and the sporting events. Happy Hour is from 3-6 during the week with decent deals, but the drinks are more akin to the taste of quarter drinks. Portion size is good however and thr service didn't disappoint."}
{"text":"Been here a couple of times with my husband, who agrees with this review.  Wait staff ranges from friendly to put-upon, booths are hard and uncomfortable, overpriced ($11.95 for two chicken enchiladas, rice and beans; $7.95 for a vegetarian burrito and beans), chips were salty, cold, and had a rancid grease aftertaste; good salsa.  Pretty mediocre lunch in every way.  Definitely gringo."}
{"text":"This place gets two stars only because my wife loves the rellenos. I had the fish tacos. Could hardly find or taste the fish. I was going to give 3 stars but they just refilled my water it taste like they got it from the sewer. I was literally drinking the salsa to get the taste out of my mouth. They are lucky they are getting two stars. I'm sure I won't be coming back unless my wife drags me in for a relleno."}
{"text":"Decided to give this place another shot with it being Cinco de Mayo and had a better experience this time around.  Service was great albeit a bit slow for lunchtime. Our server (Tyler) was pretty attentive for it being just his first week. My work badge accidentally fell off in the booth as I got up to leave and he was quick enough to catch me before I left to give it back - Good eye!  I went with the cheese enchiladas and definitely did not find it hard to gobble up. Savory red sauce paired with ooey-gooey cheese baked to perfection within a four tortilla..yum! Standard rice and beans as a side.  Most of my coworkers enjoyed their meals.. the only meal that received complaints were the fish tacos. The breaded fish tasted like and resembled that of a frozen fish stick - perhaps not so fresh?  This place is nothing super special but is a decent lunch if you work in the area. Glad I gave this place another shot!"}
{"text":"HORRIBLE !!! I got 2 combos (2 crispy tacos, enchilada, rice and beans) and it cost almost $30. My bad for not checking the order. When I got hot I was shocked by the small portions, the stale chips and the \"crispy\" tacos that were soft taco shells. The WORST part besides the small portions was the quality. Tacos tasted bland, rice and beans tasted out of a can and the enchilada was bland and dry. Sauce also tasted out of a bottle. For the price I fill so ripped off. I have a Filbertos near me and for half the price I could have had better. AVOID AT ALL COST as they don't care."}
{"text":"It took a couple minutes to be greeted by our server, we ordered drinks & that took a while. Then we waited over 10 minutes to order our food, I was expecting the food to be decent but it wasn't. The beef taco wasn't good at all, & the server never asked if we wanted refills. I'm not from Arizona so I didn't know what to expect, but the service was not good. Would not recommend this place."}
{"text":"I have been to this place a few times. I keep hoping it will get better. The servers are not very attentive to the tables. My water glass was empty multiple times. I would recommend having more then one type of salsa in the table for the chips. Not everyone likes spicy salsa.  The food was good and came out fast. The chicken w/red sauce enchiladas was very tasty. The service is slow, even having my card ready when he dropped off the check still took him time since he chose not to take the card with him but instead go check on another table, forget about our check and card for 5-10 mins. Lastly the bathrooms specifically the women's needs some serious cleaning. If a toilet is broken, close the door and put a sign on it. It's not appropriate to still allow customers to use it with the top off and a small trash can being used to keep something together on top. The sink was not clean and overall needs to be revamped. I hope this place can stay in business, but if they don't make changes soon I can see them having to close due to customers not wanting to return. The food is not amazing so besides a low key environment and the mean coming out fast I don't know why else people return."}
{"text":"Nothing special. Considering the competition amongst Mexican food joints in the Phoenix area, there are plenty of more appealing options available.  Wait staff was great, though..."}
{"text":"Your basic Mexican restaurant.  Frankly, it would be a disappointment as a destination in and of itself, but it is a nice alternative for downtown Phoenix business luncheons or meeting friends before a Diamondback/Suns game. It would also work well for parents of the burgeoning number of ASU students downtown. You could meet junior at the Arizona Center without having to embarrass him/her with your presence on campus.   The restaurant has ample seating capacity for when events nearby bring in the crowds.  Seating outside is limited.  Service on this Saturday was slow, which seems to be a common occurrence. Chips and salsa were served promptly.  The chips are of the light white corn variety, but suffer from a stale mass produced quality.  The salsa was good, but our table requested an alternative sauce with a bit more zest.  It was much tastier and had almost an enchilada sauce quality.    Food served was uniformly consistent.  Not spectacular, but nothing to complain about.  We had an assortment of tacos and enchiladas.  The happiest diners at our table were the two youngsters who ordered cheese crisps from the kid's menu.  Not a Mexican restaurant to get excited about given the many alternatives around Phoenix, but a decent offering with lots of seating capacity in an area where restaurants tend to have no customers or too many to handle."}
{"text":"I went to Mi Amigo's for lunch and to catch some of the college football games.    I was craving strawberry frozen alcohol so I ordered a daiquiri and ended up having 3 of them along with some machaca nachos.  The nachos were full of flavor and had lots of meat on them.  They were a little too heavy for my liking but they were good.    The service was great and chips and salsa were complimentary and were good as well.  Overall a good experience."}
{"text":"Ventured off to Mi Amigo's with mi amigos for lunch today and had an A-OK pleasant experience. Big place, nice size menu and pretty decent speed on bringing the food out ( i was clock watching , since it was just a lunch break). Lunch prices are very reasonable. I had the veggie burrito. Very tasty and very filing. Zucchini, spinach, carrots,, peppers, rice etc.. loved the variety of the ingredients. Mi amigos enjoyed their dishes as well. ( yes you get free chips and salsa to start- i know you were thinking about it).  They have happy hour 3-6 and indoor/outdoor seating as well.   Overall..pretty average food....not bad and not the greatest. Will it stop the rumbling in yo' tummy without breaking your budget? Word."}
{"text":"The ice tea was good.. So fake. Food was bland and dry and no thought processes. Waitress didn't even ask how my food was. Because she knew it sucked. Oh one other thing about the menu. For lunch 1 taco with rice and beans $5.95. regular menu  2 tacos, rice and beans $8.95????"}
{"text":"Well I would have given a review but they closed 30 min early . And all just wanted some tacos and would have taken them To go.....Garbage!!!"}
{"text":"The employees are really nice & people really seem to like this place, but I will never return. It's unauthentic Mexican food, prices are crazy for the foods ($10 for two cheese enchiladas side of dried, hard Spanish rice and Refried beans from a can). I really wanted to give this place one star because as we sat waiting for our food a little roach came out to say hello, numerous times. Someone in my party tried to say it was was a beetle, but when it crawled out from its hole on the wall that enclosed our booth it was clear that it was in fact a cockroach...and for that, I'm out!"}
{"text":"This is a good place to bring the family. Love the beans and rice. Tonight I had the veggie burrito and it was good. The chips and salsa are excellent. Not too loud. Always good service."}
{"text":"Mi Amigos is one of my favorite Mexican Food restaurants for two simple reasons. 1. I love the chips & salsa and 2. They have my all time favorite chile relleno.  The Chips & Salsa Mi Amigos gives you some of the largest chips I've come across.  They are little half tortillas that are crisp and simple.  The salsa is heavy on the cilantro, but its chunky with good flavor.  I'm all about the big chunks of tomato in my salsa.  MY FAVORITE CHILE RELLENO I've been ordering this big beast of a relleno stuffed full of chicken for years.  The chicken inside is simply grilled chicken and its covered in some gooey cheese.  The pepper is a little bit random in heat - sometimes I sweat like a B while shoveling away, and sometimes it's rather mild. The batter they cook it in is different than most rellenos, its sort of crumby and dark, but delicious.  The sauce is some simple looking orange sauce with some sour cream in it - sorry, I can't cook so my skills in ingredient identification suck - I just know it's delicious!  My favorite.  I order it every time I'm there.  I visit this Mi Amigos every time I'm in the area looking for food.  I can't remember the last Arizona Center place I ate at other than Mi Amigos.  I have to have the relleno any time I'm near."}
{"text":"I've been expecting this place to get better whenever I go there, but each time has brought a bad experience. The first time, I had a horribly rude waitress and slow service. The food was mediocre. The second time, I had a great meal with the enchiladas and good service, but my significant other had to ask to take the food back once, and almost a second time, too! For a Mexican food place in the middle of Phoenix, one would expect authentic and flavorful cuisine,  but this place is far from it and overpriced to add."}
{"text":"The chips and salsa were pretty good.  The salsa a little on the spicy side, which I like.  The chips were too big though.  I ordered the \"numero tres\", which had 2 beef tacos and a cheese enchilada.  Both were tasty.  The beef could have used more seasoning or smoething for more flavor.  The service was great, although when I went in around 6pm on a Tuesday it was slow."}
{"text":"A pretty decent place for a quick lunch during work hours. Their food is pretty consistent and their service is always top notch. I've ordered their taco salad, beef tacos, fish tacos, and enchiladas. All pretty tasty and not too spicy. I love their chips and salsa. Since I work in the area, I will always be stopping by for a quick lunch grub."}
{"text":"The husband and I used to like coming to Mi Amigos when we first started dating b/c we would see a lot of movies, you know go on movie dates, these dates are pretty funny b/c you don't have to actually talk to your date for a good duration of the date-- it's so brilliant!   But this is also why \"dinner and a movie\" is so popular.    So we would have some dinners at Mi Amigo's until the frightful night.  The night we ate at Mi Amigos and I ordered the tamale for the first time (usually I stick with tacos at Mexican food restaurants and I just love tacos).  It was delicious and I enjoyed every last bit of that tamale.  We go to the movie, he drops me off at home, I go to bed and am up at 4am with the taste of tamales in my mouth.  I feel like I might have indigestion, but NO. NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO-- I had my very first date with food poisoning.    You know the drill on this so I won't go into detail.  I can't give the place one star b/c of all the other times we went and had 2-3 star  food and decent service.  So I gave 2 stars but told you all that I got food poisoning here.  It really should be 1.5 stars.  The  worst part is I can never eat another tamale again, ever.  ."}
{"text":"Good food nice atmosphere for down town Phoenix Great place to grab some lunch before or after a movie."}
{"text":"they have free chips and salsa  they do have fajitas  they do have margaritas  my wife and i have been coming here for 1/365th of a year.   the photos of the front of the building are accurate"}
{"text":"Headed here for a quick dinner at the bar after a long day. My food came out quick, and was decent as far as Mexican food goes. However, the service was really slow and poor overall. The place was nearly empty with servers running around to help ghosts and the bartender going to take orders at booths....It took me less than 20 minutes to get my food and eat but I had to wait another 20 just to pay up and leave the restaurant!"}
{"text":"Had great service if a bit slow,bit then again it was Father's Day. I just wish they hard a bit less spicy salsa for those of us who don't like spice.  Mi Amigo's seems to be our go to Mexican restaurant my dad loves the green tamale and my stepmom likes the mango shrimp Quesadilla while I go with the cheese enchilada platter."}
{"text":"I started a new job and the bosses brought us here for lunch.  It was ok.  I got a lunch combo meal, but I didn't pay. The service was really great but the food was not.  Just kind of plain.   It's convenient to work, so I will probably be back, I just won't have very high expectations."}
{"text":"It was on the right side of the street and I was hungry.  Chips and a decent but partially canned tomato salsa came quickly.  Not tortilla chips, but corn tortillas cut in half and fried. They were fresh, but you have to break them to eat. I ordered the fish tacos. They came quickly. They tasted good, with a slightly sweet cabbage slaw and a good sauce. The fish was breaded and tasted like frozen fish. The black beans were definitely canned, although they were dressed with fresh cilantro and onions. The rice was bland. However the flan was wonderful. Cinnamon and proper sugar syrup and whipped cream."}
{"text":"Wonderful food! Excellent service! Great lunchtime atmosphere!"}
{"text":"It was OK. A Mexican restaurant without con queso is crazy! Food was average at best. Service was good and the strawberry margarita was good but the food was not impressive."}
{"text":"Went here because it was within walking distance of my hotel. I'm from Texas and eat Mexican food a lot, and this was on the low end for sure. Everything seemed cheaply made. I had the chile relleno which wasn't bad, but did not seem to have quality ingredients. My friend had the chimichanga and sent it back because it wasn't good and got enchiladas instead. They were okay, but drenched in sauce.  I wouldn't come back."}
{"text":"I went a few weeks ago during Phoenix Comic Con.  It was far enough away to not be swarmed with people.  We were really hungry so the free chips and salsa brought out was nice.  I got the chicken chimichanga plate.  It was okay.  It was fulfilling and plenty of food.   The price is similar to what you get other places downtown.   The server bumped this rating from 3 stars to 4 stars.  She was pleasant and efficient.  I appreciated that she brought out the checks quickly because we want to get back to our event."}
{"text":"I haven't eaten here in years because the food was just ok. But I was pleasantly surprised tonight. First of all the salsa had great flavor, lots of garlic and fresh herbs. I loved it!! The chips were a bit greasy, not my favorite. I ordered the shrimp enchiladas with green sauce. Mmmmm good choice! Very generous with the shrimp, and the green sauce definitely made the dish. Glad I came back, I'm excited to try a few more things next time."}
{"text":"Great location, outdoor patio was lovely and lively. Vegan and gluten-free options on menu. I had fresh guacamole, prepared table-side. Chips & salsa were delicious and the vegan black beans too. Take out available and the restaurant was kid-friendly. The service was friendly, orders were all accurate, but the place appeared understaffed and we waited a long time for each step of the process (about 30 minutes to pay bill). However, I don't know their usual staff ratio, so still highly recommend a visit."}
{"text":"Had dinner before a movie, we walked in and it was pretty dead except for a few Jedis and pikachus, and marios bros (comicon weekend). We sat down and ordered our drinks the waitress was very kind and suggested a higher quality margarita for my sister since they didn't have patron... But seriously what kinda Mexican restaurant does not have Patron... Anyhoo, I ordered a Tecate and asked for a glass with Tajin (Mexican Chili lime powder) and they again told me they didn't have this.. Again I was shocked....This is something Mexican restaurants should have in stock at all times. Instead I got Dos Equis... We ordered or food and I swear they must have had these plates ready because they came out within 5 min... I got machaca chimichangas, my sister got Enchiladas... As expected it was pretty good... Decent I would say, but my mom makes them better. lol. The beans were good, but rice of course was boxed uncle bens rice.. I mean c'mon... Why even open a Mexican restaurant if your just going to not really offer real Mexican food. Overall I gave it a sideways thumb... If I was hungry and everywhere was closed I would come back, but if there was other options I would take those."}
{"text":"So this first experience started off with a huge cockroach in the bathroom. Almost couldn't even sit down to go. (yuck) ok on to the rest. The chips and salsa were good with a little bit of spice. The Numero 15 is a cheese enchilada with a chicken taco rice and beans. The only flavor at this restaurant was in the salsa. It was so bland. I don't know that it was worth the $3 parking validation we came for. My friend and I love Mexican so we picked it on our way elsewhere, my suggestion go elsewhere."}
{"text":"Last night we had a group of people so we hit Mi Amigo's in the Arizona Center since we were staying nearby. Most of the group are on limited funds, so we thought a pretty tasty chain would be ok. Now as I write this there are things that make me want to bump it to a four then other things that make me want to bump it down.  Let's see... I wasn't sure what to order and everything looked just about average in terms of dishes, so I ended up with Chile Rellenos. I rarely ever get this, so I figured tonight would be the night. Our waitress took forever to come over at first and I felt like she wasn't completely with it. She may be bilingual and a little less with the English, so she was very very quiet. She got half our table drinks and then disappeared. Eventual she came back with the others, but she could've fit them all on one tray. A few more minutes and we had some tasty albeit boring looking chips. They were so large that they could only get so many in each bowl. The salsa was terrible. Completely bland with little taste. Mostly it was chunks of tomatoes and some juice. Boring. After way too long our food came. No silverware or anything, just the food. I ate most of my beans with a knife (it looked clean!) I found on my table. We asked for sourcream and silverware. She brought the sour cream but nada on the whole silverware thing. Eventually someone found me a fork (I think from a place setting behind me) and I dug in. Great Chile Relleno! very tasty, and I think the sourcream made it for me. At the end of the meal, the waitress did agree to split the check between each of us to her defense, but overall it was a very average experience like you'd expect from a white-washed pseudo Mexican chain."}
{"text":"Belch!!!  since everyone else is doing it..i'll add a review to Mi Amigos  the food is the bestist in the wholde worlde  they has a margarita with real taquila in it. not like those fancy places who serve bootlegged taquila..  the rice is perfectly expolded and fluffy just the way rice should be..and the beans...well don't get me started on the beans..i'm still powering a rocket booster as we speak. the best part is the chips..totally authentic. no bag taste here at all..in fact i think they personally make them in the back...twice a year.   yumm yummm."}
