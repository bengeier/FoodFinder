{"text":"Had high hopes for this new little local spot. Atmosphere is great but we left with take out. Didn't like the veal sandwich, it's okay but I've had much better. Pizza was decent but wouldn't rush back for it. Though it deserves one visit before you discount it out for yourself."}
{"text":"Came across this place by accident. Tucked in behind, next to the Coppa's plaza. My husband and I had dinner on a Friday night. Place was busy but we were seated in 5 mins. We had the Mediterranean salad, the Toscana pizza and the veal sandwich. Food was very good. Waitress very friendly and attentive. Prices reasonable. My husband had the coffee affogato and loved it!"}
{"text":"Jan2017 review. Pretty bad Time overall here. Came here on a Sunday at 7:00 with my family and when we walked in the waitress looked at us like (uhh, coustomer, ) and the lights were too bright for me. When we sat down, the chefs were outside the kitchen watching the tv;kinda unprofessional and usually don't see a tv in a fine Italian restaurant. Then the waitress was rolling her eyes many many times to us and she kept giving us really dry answers when asking a question that required a long answer. Like she just wanted to go home like she was sick. Anyways the food came the pizza was pretty good and the rice balls were under average. Didn't really like them too much. Wouldn't go back there again,bad first experience"}
{"text":"When I heard a new place was opening in king I was very excited, especially it being Italian with take out available

We walk in, family of four and the place was pretty busy
I usually never mind waiting but being there with the kids 25 min for a couple of sandwiches a plate of pasta a pizza  and a poutine is a little excessive 

I will start by saying the 2 stars have really nothing to do with the service, my rating is on food and food quality, I will start with the veal sandwich...... The bread to veal ratio was out of whack, the veal was super thin with minimal toppings on a huge Kaiser, although the taste was ok the bread ratio drowned the flavour. The poutine was excellent 

The pizza was ok, the sauce was very tangy on both the pizza and the pasta, my son, a six year old couldn't eat it which is very surprising that he has never refused a plate of pasta

Try it for yourself, i don't think I'm far off after reading the reviews"}
{"text":"Having placed an order and receiving a confirmation last night, I walked in today ready to pick up my order at lunch. I got there to they have no order from me to the food being redone bc I was late so decided to show confirmation that I was actually there on time. The man did give me a small ice cream, but having only a half hour lunch to getting back just on time and having to eat my meal with no enjoyment. From I did eat it was great"}
{"text":"Nice little local spot. We had the Arranchini which were very good. Posto Poutine also very good. Panzerotto was nice as was the pizza. Nicely decorated. 
Friendly service. Keep it up we'd come back again. 
If I could give it 3.5 stars I would."}
{"text":"If I could give a 0 I would

Chicken paramasian with green peppers

It was the most disgusting thing I ever ate

Green peppers were bitter!!!!
Bread was soggy and gross!!
& the chicken was clearly pre cooked and re heated.  


This and wild wings in King. Has to be the worst places I've ever eaten at"}
{"text":"Had dinner tonight with the family and it's was great.
Ordered the veal scalapini special with mashed potatoes and saut√©ed vegetables.
Food was hot and tasty.
Will definitely go again !"}
{"text":"I come here sometimes to have a coffee or salad. Pizzas are good as well. I love all of their fancy coffee drinks . Bruschetta was delicious 
Great ambiance and atmosphere. Nice place to chill."}
{"text":"Won't ever go back. We ordered salads with chicken. Portions were so small. It says on the board $0.25 extra for each added topping. They charged us $0.50 for toppings we didn't even order. The girl was rude and talked down to us. Nothing special at all for price."}
{"text":"I used to go to this restaurant awhile back, but stopped going for about a year. I recently stopped by again and was pleasantly surprised to see that they have completely changed their menu! 

Our food took a little longer than expected but understandable as they had a large party there as well.

Friendly staff, great food, and lovely atmosphere!"}
{"text":"First time here ambience is wonderful the decor is very creative. Plenty of sunshine from the large smoked windows. Had a veal sandwich it was very delicious and it came with a smile. The service is above par and the overall place is great. Will try the daily specials next time. They have only been open for a few months. Everyone lets give them a try."}
{"text":"Posto Panino seems to be a new place with a good amount of seating and a quick service takeout or dine in menu. The menu is basically Italian with a range of pizzas, sandwiches and pasta dishes. 

The prices for the sandwiches seem reasonable until you start adding some toppings. Just a few extra additions can double the cost of the sandwich. An $8.00 veal sandwich comes out to $12 with cheese and mushrooms. 

The taste was good and the environment is OK. What seems to be lacking is a bit of enthusiasm on the people who work there. They seem to be a bit \"unmotivated\". It's hard to describe, just one of those feelings. 

Overall I think that Posto Panino will become a good quick casual spot in King City. I will definitely return when I'm the area to try some other dishes."}
{"text":"Great ambiance, great service. I ordered calabria pizza and loved it!  Loved the dough, the sauce and in house made chilli oil- great price point compare to downtown TO. I finally found somewhere so good in town! Highly recommend the pizza. Reason for 4 stars: it was just OK pasta, nothing special."}
{"text":"Great Italian food and lots of options. Doesn't break the bank and a super chic restaurant as well."}
{"text":"Ammmazing!!!! Great food... great location ...... home cooked ..... service is spectacular"}
{"text":"What a joke of a place. I ordered a chicken parm panini with green peppers and it was disgusting. The bread was soggy and the green peppers were so bitter it was unedible. The chicken itself was soggy. Stay away from this place."}
{"text":"You know when you really, really, really, reeeeeaalllllly want to like something?

And then you don't?

Posto Panino is that. 

What's worse though, is that when you enter, you think it's going to be everything you've ever wanted and more: the hip vibe of the place makes for great eye candy, the waitresses, attentive and polite (albeit, too attentive at times)...but then there's the deal breaker, the one you knew would be the deciding factor as to whether or not this was going to be a long lasting  relationship: the food.

We ordered the rice balls which were sparse on the sauce, and were cold -- which struck as odd given they were deep fried, which led us to guess they'd been pre-deep fried, then frozen, then reheated, which make for an unappetizing experience. High hopes though, there was still room for forgiveness.

The gnocchi was oddly textured (even for gnocchi) with a rose that was acrid in taste that stayed with your taste buds no matter how many sips of water you took.

The two pizzas, both the parma and Sicilia were equally unforgiving and....wait for it: cold. 

While I appreciate it's interior and convenience being one of the few restaurants in King City, it wasn't worth the $75.00, and as much as I really wanted to love this place, I just didn't."}
