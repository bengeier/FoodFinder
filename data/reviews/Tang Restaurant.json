{"text":"I got the veggie soup, and it was pretty bad. The broth itself was OK, but the vegetables were undercooked and really largely cut. It was mostly broccoli, and all of the broccoli stems had black ends. For $7.45 I thought it was overpriced, as you can get pho at a real restaurant for a similar price.

The broth contains chicken, and the girl taking my order warned me about it right away. I'm not vegetarian but I appreciated that she let me know."}
{"text":"The best service I have ever had at a fast food place!! The girls working were super friendly and the subs & bubble tea were great!"}
{"text":"At first I thought it was robbery to only give Tang 3 stars...so I went there for lunch to get my usual Mega-sub (chicken and beef) and it was pretty meh.  This place used to be my favorite viet-sub stop but it seems the quality of the food has dropped lately.  My loaded sub was much wetter and sloppier then I remember and the beef was pretty stringy.  I used to love how many carrots they would pound on there but that seemed lacking too.   Vietnamese subs are supposed to be light and healthy and I believe that this spot is starting to 'americanize' their subs with cheese and sauces.  The menu is pretty small and never seems to change so without a 1st rate sub it might not be worth the extra drive for me.  I'm sure I'll give it another try and might edit this later."}
{"text":"This is always our go to in Deerfoot Meadows. We go to Ikea once every couple of months and it's tradition to stop and eat at Tang first. 

Always friendly service, always impeccably clean, great atmosphere and of course delicious Vietnamese food.

I always order the veggie sub, the kids eat spring rolls and watermelon slushes, and my husband usually tries something new each time. Delicious and fresh every time!"}
{"text":"I enjoyed this place. The service was great, the restaurant was clean and the food was yummy.  

I had a sub and bubble tea and both where well made and tasted great. They use real fruit in all but 4 of their flavours so that was a nice to have.  

When looking for a tasty place to eat and you don't want the regular crap from fast food places nor the wait of restaurants Tang is a good option. I'd definitely eat here again and for the food options in Deerfoot meadows this one is near the top. Check it out!"}
{"text":"This restaurant wasn't bad but not great either.  The food I shared with my family, a vermicelli bowl, spring rolls and Pho soup was ok but definitely didn't hold weight when compared to the many other Viet/Asian grills we've been to.  I was reminded of a mall food court atmosphere and is exactly how I would categorize the food."}
{"text":"Great sandwiches, vermicelli bowls and soup.  Great for a quick lunch stop that is a healthy alternative to the fast food of burgers, hot dogs, etc."}
{"text":"This place is ok but staff-wise...The food is decent and the prices are fair but the staff are a little off. It's open kitchen, their was 4 staff on shift and only 5 people in the whole place, and I stood at the counter waiting for a clerk for 3 minutes, which in the real world is absolutely nothing at all and should quickly be ignored as any type of serious complaint. I only mention it cause when one of the staff finally looked up at me, looked right at me in the eyes for a few seconds...then turned around and continued doing something else. Damn.

Finally got my ladies' bubble tea and we were on our way; Not the best customer service and I got mad-respect for retail staff cause they work hard jobs and you get nothing but grief from the public, but if you're clearly over 50 and your spirit is dead, working a counter may not be the best choice."}
{"text":"Man. This was definitely a case of \"I should've scoped this place on Yelp before running in to use their bathroom and eating there out of guilt.\" 

Greasiest spring roll bowl I have ever had in my life. It's like they took all the leftover oil from Stampede, and fried my veggie spring roll bowl in it. Insipid, even the green onions tasted as though someone had scrubbed all traces of flavor out, and so damn pinguid; I feel like I need another shower so I can scrub my face down with a loofah. Not to mention, there's zero air inside the actual restaurant - I guess because they want to simulate the muggy temperature of Vietnam? - so you feel like you're going to have heat stroke the entire time you're trying to force yourself to eat what you paid for because wasting food is a mortal sin (see, Dad?! I ate all my food even though it was GROSS!). It must have been a good 35ยบ in there. 

I saw these giant powder dispensers for the bubble tea, so even though I heart bubble tea, the idea of slaking back a giant cup of watered down mystery neon sugar powder didn't interest me in the slightest. Although, maybe I should've so I wouldn't have felt like the makeup on my face was going to slide off and fall in to my lap. 

The good news is that service here is stellar. Adorable ladies that are all smiles and almost make you feel bad that they're serving such terrible food. Until, that is, the feeling that the food in your belly is sitting underneath a three-inch layer of Exxon hits you like a mail truck."}
{"text":"Wow, a bestie took me here today and I cannot wait to go back already!
Clean, inexpensive, quick and delicious!
When you walk in, it almost has a WokBox feel. You order at the counter and go have a seat, the friendly staff will call out your number. And the food is ready almost as soon as your butt hits your seat.
Love the hot sauce that comes on the side - you just have to go grab some at the counter where you get napkins, spoons, pepper etc. The meal containers are take-out style in case you cannot finish all your meal. Love. 
The staff will happily give you a cup of water, all you have to do is ask and your meal will easily be under $10.
I ordered the spicy chicken pho style soup, complete with broccoli and green onion. Loved the portion size for lunch, it was plenty. The chicken was chunky white meat and there was a good serving of it!
My friend got her ol' stand-by, the wonton soup with chicken and shrimp. The veg was so bright and the broth was clear and perfectly seasoned. I am so getting that next time.

Sidenote - A woman at the table next to me spilled her soup all over the table and floor. I did not even think about it  when I ran to get her a heap of napkins and it was cleaned up in no time. Her dining companion explained to me when they were leaving the restaurant that he was legally blind. He thanked me graciously for my reaction to assist as he had no idea where to even look for the napkins to help his friend. 
To that man - if you are reading this, you touched my heart today and reminded me what it means to live in this wonderful city that I now call home."}
{"text":"Not bad. Really good subs and rolls. Good shakes too :)"}
{"text":"This place has become a go-to place for me for Vietnamese subs. Consistently good, service is quick and friendly. I also love their bubble teas! Weekdays during lunch are always busy."}
{"text":"Tang is... ok. It reminded me a lot of a Thai Tai. Except more normalized for the burbs. Normalized meaning less options. Basically, a few smoothies, a few Vietnamese subs, some vermicelli bowls, etc.

Service and process gets 4 stars. The girls working the cash and prepping the smoothies were fast and efficient at noon hour on a Saturday. And the folks in the back were prompt with getting those subs out and ready to eat.

I wouldn't make the trip all the way out to Deerfoot Meadows to hit up Tang, but I'd certainly pick it over some other options in the area."}
{"text":"Spence and I were down shopping in the Deerfoot Meadows area and he wanted some bubble tea.  We didn't think there were any until we found Tang.  It's kind of tucked in a corner and when you enter, it looks very similar to Thai Tai, the decor and all!  I'm not sure if it's the same owner with a different name but the menu items look almost identical.

Anyways, Spence ordered the Strawberry mango bubble tea with pearls, and I ordered the Watermelon bubble tea with pearls.  Customer service was great, service was fast and we were on our way.

We took our straws and stabbed it through the plastic at the top of the cup (Muah-hahahaaa, that's the best part!!! haha) and we sipped.  I found my watermelon to be ... tasteless.  It seemed like they used an old watermelon or the green parts (closest to the core) of the watermelon.  It wasn't that good!!  Spence enjoyed his Strawberry mango though!  He said it tasted like the one he gets at Thai Tai.  The pearls were harder than usual, I like when the pearls are softer with a sweet taste.

It must have been an off time for the watermelon, maybe because they're no longer in season?? Hmm...I'll never know!! And the pearls..meh.

I will probably come back...to accompany Spence and his Strawberry Mango bubble tea craving, if we're in the area."}
{"text":"You know what? It could all be in my head, but I feel like Tang's subs are just not as good as they used to be when it was under another name.

Visiting again seemed to just confirm that.

While the subs are good, they are not great. I used to feel they had the best subs in the city, but I think it has gone downhill a little bit. Not extremely, but just overall pretty underwhelming.

It seems like the ratio of the subs is just a little off. Too much bread, or too stale or something. Just overall a little to dry."}
