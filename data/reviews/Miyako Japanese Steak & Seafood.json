{"text":"My all time favorite hibachi restaurant. Way better than Benihana! The sauces are great! Best shrimp sauce. Love, love it!"}
{"text":"Yummy!! I've been here many times for hibachi and each time I've left stuffed and satisfied! The staff is always nice and the chefs seemed well trained!
The place is a little dated, but other than that it's a great place to eat!!"}
{"text":"First off, I would suggest making a reservation here even if it is a weekday. We arrived for dinner at 5:15 on a Wednesday and had to wait about 15 minutes for them to prep for us. First, I ordered a Miyako cocktail. Being the namesake, I figured it was the safe choice. While it was OK (it was alcohol) it was not as good as I expected. It was basically a pina colada on the rocks. The soup and salad are good but typical of any Japanese Steakhouse. The shrimp appetizer that comes with the meal is nice, but the shrimp sauce is excellent (my daughter used it for everything). The main attraction at these places is the food preparation. And so much of this is in the luck of the draw - which chef will you get. I know there are good ones at Miyako, but we got an average one. He was nice enough, but his appearance was sketchy and he had what I would call beginner skills. I ordered the New York Strip - medium, but it was a tad overdone. And just not as tasty as I would like. But all the vegetables were excellent. My kids ordered some kind of kids steak and both loved theirs. The kids also get ice cream with their order which they enjoy. I would probably give this place 3 stars, but my #1 daughter likes it so much (she said she is choosing this place for her birthday dinner come June) I have to give it 4 stars."}
{"text":"Food was fantastic!  Seems like the chef is hit or miss.  We had a chef who wasn't even slightly Japanese.  He was friendly and talkative but did nothing other than cook our food.  At the end of the meal when he found out that the person I was with had never eaten Hibachi before, he said \"If I had known that, I would've done some of the fancy stuff.\". Left me wondering why he doesn't always do the \"fancy stuff\".  It is a hibachi restaurant after all.  

Saw another chef while we were there and he was a traditional, entertaining hibachi chef."}
{"text":"My family has been going to Miyako for many years and we think it's the best hibachi style restaurant in PGH. Are there others with better atmosphere, yes. Are there others that have chefs doing better tricks while cooking, maybe. We think Miyako is the best because of the food.  The sauces and dressings are made fresh on location. I could eat almost anything if it had their ginger dressing on top."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times before always had a plesant experience until now. Arrive for lunch at 1:40 and the host (guy with ponytail) was extremely rude bc they close at 2. Another group of 4 then a 2 arrived after us and I overheard him make the same rude comments about arriving close to closing time. The chef also made a comment about arriving late and rushed our food. An hour later I got extremely sick. I work in a restaurant and if any of my staff acting the way this staff did they would of been fired immediately. The waitress's was the only nice experience we had. Host at the door needs to take some customer service lessons. Never again."}
{"text":"I love the clear soup.  I also love dumping their steak sauce all over the rice.  I don't like the fried rice though, it's often hard and kind of tasteless.  If you want fried rice, get it at a Chinese place where they cook it in a wok."}
{"text":"We had a nice time here, but there were positives and negatives which is why it got the 3 star rating.  Pros: I thought the shrimp sauce was really good, the scallops were good, and the service was good.  Some cons: we had to pay extra for fried rice (which was a little dry), the steak sauce was average (they said it was best around), it took awhile to get our check,  and our chef was average (we saw others in the restaurant who were better).  Overall, a nice time but not the best experience we have had at a hibachi."}
{"text":"Still an all time favorite! The shrimp sauce is the best we have had, fried rice is great but the atmosphere could use some updating! We have been going there for over 10 year and nothing has changed - tough to compete with all the new, local Japanese Steakhouses!"}
{"text":"Although the food was very good, hence the two star rating; not one, the service was dreadful. Yes, it is a steak and seafood place, but they also serve sushi. The waiter failed to ask me for a drink preference, had given no chopsticks and frankly I could have used a lot more soy sauce. The place was busy, yes, but they ignored me until he slapped down the bill and failed to ask me if I wanted anything else. Great, fresh sushi, horrendous service!"}
{"text":"This was highly recommended by the hotel over the closer ones. I should have went to one of the other ones I inquired about.  Food was average. Limited menu. Very few vegetables were served. Soup was bland and fried rice was horrible! Salad was ok.  Nice chef and waitress. Good portion of shrimp. OK steak but thin chicken. Wouldnt accept entertainment mobile coupon that the site said they take. They expected me to have a mobile printer in my car."}
{"text":"I have been coming to miyako's for as long as I can remember. It's clearly an established place and the interior shows it. I've wondered if they would ever update the dilapidated decor, but not yet. But this is about the food I suppose. Not that it isn't a clean establishment, because it is! As common sense would suggest, having the veteran chefs adds to a better experience. However, all the chefs I've ever met have been hardworking and charismatic. The ginger salad dressing is addicting and the shrimp sauce is equally so. This is definitely a staple in the Wexford bubble and worth stopping by if you have the extra cash."}
{"text":"One visit last week:

I am not a fan of the Hibachi venue; oddly showy and unless done perfectly it justn't make the food any better at all. Perhaps after a few drinks but...  

So on a cold early evening we sat over by the windows near the Sushi Bar.  No reservations.  This was a terrible mistake for seating.  Whenever the doors opened, the huge fans above the hibachi areas created a vortex of freezing air right onto us and a few other tables.  After a couple of cold air blasts, we decided to have an appetizer only and leave. 

Service was okay, but nothing spectacular.  They were understaffed at the wait areas.  Just not enough people.  

Food: sliced ginger very good.  Shrimp sushi -- a little different than I have ever had but passable, not remarkable.  Rice -- okay but I do think sticky rice should actually be sticky.  Chopsticks -- the cheapest wooden one you can find are superior to these odd round things which few can actually use well.  

Gyoza -- well, what a disappointment.  There were mere puffy bits of flour/dough with little if anything inside.  Having been in number places that serve Gyoza over the years, these were oddly unremarkable.  Miso was not interesting or nuanced.  The shrimp sushi were, however, well made and formed. Sushi chefs were attentive and knew what they were doing (well practiced).

Next time we will make reservations and sit at the grown up tables in the middle and back, but still away from the hibachi drama.  We will order a larger array of sushi.  

I've said \"A-OK\" since this was a one time visit.  Others were enjoying themselves and the food.  Perhaps it was being subjected to the artic air blasts by the sushi bar.  Will try again and update then.

 f8 and be there."}
{"text":"I hate to give any place a poor review....especially one with such nice employees.....

With that being said.....

I think this place is overrated.  No ambience, terrible atmosphere, nothing special about some sweaty guy cooking at your table clanking knives.  They need better circulation or ventilation or something.  Maybe they should just clean the carpet and paint.  The food is okay.  Maybe is was my date.  I don't know, but not a nice evening at all.  Still giving 3 stars for trying."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely amazing!! Best food, best sushi and awesome service. I've been going here for years and the trip is worth it every single time. The shrimp sauce is to absolutely die for. I've had some bad experiences but it's all about going to the right chefs (the noobs are never good). I would request for a more experienced chef whose been there for a couple years. Love love LOVE this place!!!"}
