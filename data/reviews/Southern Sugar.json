{"text":"My kids and I stopped in hoping for a few treats for an afternoon snack. The interior is gorgeous. The cashier was friendly.   However, I was really, really surprised about the baked goods. For an establishment called Southern Sugar, I was not impressed. All of the items looked like they were prepared by a home cook, which is to say they looked okay I guess, but not impressive. The cupcakes were small and haphazardly iced, the muffins were small and dry looking, cookies were unevenly baked and again just completely average looking. Very few choices overall.   I'm gonna tell ya, we love our baked goods and never struggle to find treats at a bakery!  We ended up leaving with one peanut butter cookie that I only purchased because the cashier was standing in front of me and I didn't want to be rude. We took it to go and it was fine. Very crumbly and dry (I suspect shortening was used vs butter) and even though we shared it amongst the three of us, no one complained for more.   I really was hoping for a true bakery experience. Even the kids were bummed because we've been watching this place go in for months and were so excited to try it. I hope we just caught them on an off day when maybe the B team was baking. We'll give them another try in a month or two to see if they improve."}
{"text":"I great new spot in downtown Fort Mill! The gelato with coffee is a most! The cocktails are phenomenal! And the fries with cheese and rosemary is a must try! I am excited to come back and try more things on the menu!"}
{"text":"Super cute atmosphere! Kind and attentive staff. Great indoor and outdoor space. I have been twice. The first time was about 30 minutes before close and they were already packing up all the pastries so we left without anything. The second time I enjoyed a cocktail on the patio and grabbed a pastry from inside (no menu as they regularly change). Unfortunately, they had just a few basics- brownies, cupcakes, coconut macaroons, and bars. That was it. I tried a bar and macaroon. They were ok. I asked for something warm and was informed there was no warm dessert options (wasn't even offered to microwave my bar). Overall the place was great, but expected more SUGAR."}
{"text":"While the place has a charming atmosphere the food and service left a lot to be desired. I'll start with the more important review; the food.  The food was grossly overpriced considering the taste and quantity. We ordered the biscuits, caprese flatbread, grilled veggie platter, red velvet cupcake, and blueberry muffin. The cupcake and muffin tasted exactly the same, like cornbread. The grilled veggie platter was $12 for a tablespoon of sliced red pepper, a cup of carrots, and about a half cup of asparagus. The carrots were bland, but the asparagus and peppers were good and had a decent glaze over it. The biscuits were also good but not enough strawberry jam to use on all of them. The flatbread eventually made its way to our table (server forgot to bring it and we had to ask what happened to it before it came out). The flatbread was cold, the crust was chewy and either undercooked/pre-cooked/not cooked at all I couldn't tell. The menu is very limited, only about 8 items total, even though we weren't expecting to eat anything other than baked goods the bakery selection was also very limited so we didn't have much of a choice.  Next most important thing; the service/atmosphere. The hostess asked if we wanted to sit inside or outside. The weather was nice so we said outside... she promptly took us to a table inside? The room we were in was small and had 3 tables. One long table with a large party of women. They were very loud, the other table actually asked to be moved to a different area because it was too loud. The bakery is difficult to get to because of the table layout. The line wasn't very long but it felt crowded as a result.  For patrons planning to come in with kids, don't. The only thing kid friendly is the baked goods and as mentioned above they all taste like cornbread.   This place feels more like a tapas and casual conversation spot. Grab a beer, chat with friends, meet with a client, etc."}
{"text":"So much potential but so far to go....we were so excited for this place to open. We've given it 2 tries and both were sadly disappointing. My critiques:  -No draft beer  -Ordered coffee while eating in and was given a plastic cup.  -Sat at the bar once and it took 20 minutes to get a glass of wine  -Biscuits were served cold  -We ordered the jalapeño, cheddar biscuits. Two biscuits had jalapeño & cheddar, the other 2 were plain biscuits. I like consistency and getting what I order. We mention it to the server and she says \"oh yep that looks like a plain biscuit\". Ha, thanks for giving me what I didn't order and not caring."}
{"text":"Great grand opening night. Fantastic staff with friendly faces throughout. The small bites were very well balanced and the coffee and bar selections left little to be desired. Perhaps a few more local beers could be added to the craft brew list, but overall a fantastic opening night! We will be back again. Thanks for having us join!"}
{"text":"Went here with a friend this evening. This establishment was tastefully decorated with a upper class feel to it. It had relaxing music playing in the background. I had a hot tea that was served in a adoreable cup. I also had a piece of cake. The cake tasted old and dry. I have had better cake elsewhere. Prices were good for what ordered. Overall, Southern Sugar is more of a upscale bar/coffee shop than bakery. May go back for coffee next time, definitely not dessert."}
{"text":"Southern Sugar is a cute little place. It is on the corner as you enter the downtown Fort Mill area (it took me a few laps around to find!). The inside of this restaurant was decorated nicely, and I loved the chandeliers with exposed brick walls. There was a bar with seating, several tables in the main area, then a \"wine cellar\" with two small tables and a long table. It was raining when I went, or I would have enjoyed sitting outside on the patio. With free WiFi, this was a good location to work for the afternoon.   There is a coffee counter with all of the traditional coffee shop offerings, and some additional ones like nitro coffee and coffee flights. The prices seemed reasonable. I was not impressed with the taste of my Americano, however. If I come back for coffee, I will order something else. There was also a case of baked goods, which looked pretty good.    Southern Sugar is also a bar and restaurant. The people at the table next to me had a bottle of wine, and the bar stools were all full when I left. They have \"dinner bites\" starting at 5 and accept call ahead seating. I glanced at the food menu on my way out, and I will definitely return for wine and food one evening or for brunch."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I have been awaiting the opening of Southern Sugar and it's finally here! Our first experience was at the Strawberry Festival in the summer. The owners were selling desserts and promoting their new business. We ordered the strawberry shortcake and chocolate covered strawberries. All of which were delicious and homemade. A few weekends ago, we arrived at Southern Sugar and we were beyond impressed. The interior was beautiful and charming. I was already envisioning frequent coffee dates, brunches, and wine nights. My boyfriend enjoyed a coffee, while I enjoyed a delicious chai tea latte. The owners were very welcoming and friendly, checking on customers and offering water. We really enjoyed our experience and look forward to the Grand Opening!"}
{"text":"My cousin took me here on the 18th of March. It's a cute place. We had a cup of coffee and bakeries. We sat at the patio enjoying the Sun while planning for a baby shower. I can't wait to come back and try more, especially the wine bar!!!"}
{"text":"Super addition to downtown Fort Mill. We went for mothers day brunch. The food was good. Look forward to a evening meal."}
{"text":"Nice new brunch spot for locals.  Gave an uptown vibe but with a home town feel.  Anywhere that offers bottomless mimosas is a hit for me.  The chicken and waffles could improve slightly, especially for the price.. i want a legit waffle with some syrup and that raspberry coli just wasn't doin it.. overall the atmosphere and ambiance was super cute and would def go back"}
{"text":"I had a coconut macaroon and the best red wine I've had in awhile. Go for the ambiance, stay for the delicious pastries and wine. Cool place!"}
{"text":"A much needed coffee/wine bar in Fort Mill! What a great addition to the area. The staff, atmosphere, attention to detail, service and quality is fantastic! I can't wait to be back!!!"}
{"text":"If you're looking for a great Sunday brunch spot....look no further!! I LOVE this place. Its still starting out so the service is spotty but they're always smiling! I've gotten the brunch tacos which were delicious! The chicken and waffles are also to die for! The mocha white is my favorite coffee and I love it paired with the cinnamon sugar cronut"}
{"text":"The staff has character and that's what I love the most. Absolutely amazing place! Really new establishment in a really old building. It has awesome appetizers and great mixed drinks, wine, and craft beer. Incredible atmosphere; the music and vibe in the building was exactly what you're looking for! When I think of downtown Fort Mill, I think of Southern Sugar."}
{"text":"I got a vanilla latte with oat milk and it was delicious. And it was a reasonable price. I also got a macaron. Which was ok but nothing to write home about. If they had different flavors of macarons that would be nice. But over all the macaron was delicious and the butter cream inside was good. Love the look of the place. Super cute and inviting. The staff was also very nice and answered my questions."}
{"text":"I was very excited to have a local coffee shop in the area, and I came here with high expectations. I am a huge lover of matcha, and try matcha drinks everywhere I can. That being said, the matcha latte here had zero matcha flavor. The matcha latte tasted like I was drinking plain hot milk - very disappointing."}
{"text":"This is a very charming cafe. Customer service was very good. However, the bakery items we had were not worth what was paid. The vanilla cupcakes and chocolate chip cookies were too small and not very tasty. We didn't try any of their sandwiches or coffee items. Hopefully those are better."}
{"text":"I was fort mill an found this cute coffee/desert shop . Glad I stopped found some wonderful treats an even got a vegan cinnamon roll it was the best. Its near Hobos in fort mill which is great burgers than go grab a sweet treat at southern sugar. Very friendly staff Im not a coffee drinker but it smelled really good :)"}
{"text":"Awesome first time coming to this new place in downtown Ft mill. Love the diversity and offerings. Great service as well. Check it out for sure."}
{"text":"Went here today for the first time! Really enjoyed the atmosphere, the decor, the rustic feel of the old building but with southern charm spun into it. I had a caramel latte, very good and very reasonably priced, i also had a chocolate cupcake which was very good as well, maybe a little too much frosting but the frosting tasted very good. My friend had an iced latte which was served in an adorable mason jar and a vanilla cupcake which she also said she liked a lot! Very friendly and informative staff and chill environment. Definitely will be visiting again soon!"}
{"text":"Nice area with friendly management staff, however there are some glaring issues that need to be addressed. First off, an understanding of one's role: Four of us came in through the front door and the \"hostess\" had no idea what we wanted or where to seat us. Then our waiter did not come up to our table for about 10 minutes and did not even bring us menus and simply asked us what we wanted. Second, a better wine selection Third, figure out what to do with children patrons as we sat down with little kids running all over the place where they could have injured themselves or others.  I'm sure we'll go back and that management will iron out some of the kinks as time goes on."}
{"text":"Hey, Sugar!  What a fun little addition to the downtown Fort Mill area. Southern Sugar is a welcomed concept. A tagline like \"espresso until prosecco\" had me interested from the moment we walked by.   After a little arm twisting, we stopped for cocktails to break up our Saturday afternoon. Such a cute small space, I felt right at home. They offer outdoor seating, about 20 seats inside and a bar to accommodate your party as well.   The biggest perk, Sourthern Sugar is one of the only places that I've seen Stumptown (coffee brand) served! They have it in bags to buy, cold brew, nitro and hot."}
