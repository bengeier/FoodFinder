{"text":"We had a really nice dinner at Minneci's last night.

It was decently busy, especially since it was right before an Illini basketball game. It really cleared out after that which was nice because I was with my family and wanted to sit and talk. Even when it was crowded and there were two other groups in our small-ish room, it was easy to hear each other. The music was nice, but wasn't blaring like some restaurants like to do. It was a reasonable volume

The food was delicious. My husband and I both ordered the \"Angry Pasta.\" I forget what the real name is. It was a HUGE portion! It had a nice spiciness to it, not overwhelming though. Topped with lots of fresh basil. VERY nicely done! The garlic bread was good also, very buttery.  I just had the leftovers for lunch, and it was still really good. 

The only thing keeping me from a five star rating is the service. We had a young waitress, I'm sure she was a student at the university and didn't care that much. She just didn't seem to be happy that we were there, only brought 4 appetizer plates for 5 people (finally brought one AFTER the 1st appetizer was done) and she forgot the second appetizer. 

I will be going back again next time I have a hankering for some good Italian food."}
{"text":"This was possibly the worst Italian meal I've ever eaten. Chicken saltimbocca was prepared wrong, thick rubbery chicken with a piece of prosciutto sitting on top, swimming in a yellow watery sauce. Even the side of pasta was inedible, with a too sweet ketchup-y meat sauce.   Save yourself & your money & stay away from this place."}
{"text":"Excellent food, service and atmosphere!  I was visiting from out of town and had a craving for high quality Italian food and wine for a decent price, and I was so lucky to have been driving by this place and stopped in.  We had the spinach tortellini with the homemade salsa rosa (excellent!) and the huge house Italian salad. The place has a homey feel, but very professional wait staff.  I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"If you haven't tried Minneci's lately - you should go. The restaurant has undergone some great changes, polishing things up nicely. I have always had excellent food (try the spicy marinara!) and friendly, welcoming service. The wine list is approachable and the menu has all the classics done right plus some great extras like a delicious italian beef sandwich."}
{"text":"Have been here a few times over the past three years. It was never remarkable, in either way. I would say it was on par with Manzella's. Friendly staff, decent food, but not amazing.

***BUT***

We had a gc and went to use it, not realizing the ownership had changed.  BIG Improvement. The new owner claims that the recipes have not changed, but when I questioned this he said  the only thing that they changed is that they have started using higher quality ingredients.

Our table ordered: Chicken Parm, Tortellini with Salsa Rosa (mix of Marinara and Alfredo), Meat Lasagna, Italian Beef Sandwich, Chicken Marsala, Beef Ravioli, Clam Chowder, and Salads. The clam chowder was delicious - much better than the previous (pasty and thick) version. The Marsala was also much better. In both dishes you could tell that it was more \"from scratch\" and flavorful with the addition of wine/Marsala that didn't seem present before. The portions are mostly generous (the lasagna was smaller than expected, my brother was still hungry after his salad, garlic bread, and lasagna, and he's not huge, 6'2\", 185ish). My husband said the sandwich needed salt, and I would prefer no/less herbs on the garlic bread, but overall, this was a much better experience. I would go back just for the soup!"}
{"text":"I've been there twice and the food is awesome. 

I will rate last night's dinner now. 

I had two drinks: the raspberry cosmo and the pear something or other. Both were delicious, not stingy with the alcohol and reasonably priced at 5-6$.

I absolutely love the minestrone soup. The garlic bread and rolls were delicious. I ordered linguine with white clam sauce and it was nom-tastic. Other members of my party orded the spinach tortellini (yum), the veal parmesan (this is good, too I had this the first time I went). 

Since it was my birthday, I got a free cannoli for dessert. It was maybe a bit too sweet but I'm not a huge dessert fan. 

The service was awesome. We were in a large group of about 17 people and everything came out correctly and at the same time and fairly quickly. The servers were very fun and personable. 

The atmosphere was great. We were all put at one table. It was just the best venue for what I wanted. I just went yesterday and I really want to go back :)."}
{"text":"Had lunch once and dinner once. The amount of dinner was big enough. And the price for lunch was not expensive. I can't tell if the taste was authentic. But I like it. This is a delegate but low profile restaurant. It is a hidden gem in Champaign."}
{"text":"I'm not normally a critical or picky person.

I say that so other readers might understand how bad our food experience at Mineci's was.

When we first entered, 7pm on a Monday evening, the entire resteraunt smelled strongly of dust and musk - which really should have warned us away, but it was date night, so neither of us said anything.

The second warning came when we noticed we were the only patrons who couldn't remember World War 2.

Happily, our waitress was prompt, friendly, and professional.  But that's the only kind thing I can find to say.

I ordered the Chicken Parmesan with a side of spaghetti marinara and my wife ordered the Chicken Saltimbocca.

When the garlic bread came, we tried to share a good natured laugh - the cook had taken Italian sandwich roles similar to what you would find at Walmart, buttered them, and toasted them.  This is when I started to worry.

When the food came, the Chicken Saltimbocca proved to be a very cheap cut of chicken that had been boiled in an even cheaper white wine, and served.  No spices, nothing in the wine reduction \"sauce\" except wine and reduction.

The sauce on both Chicken Parmesan and Spaghetti Marinara very clearly came straight out of a can - not even a jar.

Every bit was so bad we both agreed it was a bigger punishment to eat it than to waste the money not eating it.   After paying the $50 check, we each got a $6 butterburger from a drivethrough.

I tried this location based on the sporratic good reviews I saw here for it.  Maybe it's one of those places that has a great cook and a terrible one and we caught the terrible one.  Maybe something's changed and made it terrible again.

All I do know - this was hands down the worst restaurant food I had ever had."}
{"text":"My husband and had our wedding catered by Minneci's and not only did we enjoy the food ourselves but many of our guests told us how great the food was. We have been back since then and do plan to go back again as it's one of our favourite restaurants in town. We love the steak and the Baccala."}
{"text":"I went into this dinner with high expectations.  I had heard only goods things.  
We had a great server.  She was very friendly and helpful.  When we were there we saw that they were participating in restaurant week.  

We immediately did the couples special because it was a great deal.  We ordered calamari for the appetizer and though it was crispy, it was extremely bland and only luke warm when we received it.  

I then had a bowl of clam chowder and this we pretty good.  For our main courses we got chicken Parmesan and cod dish.  The chicken Parmesan was similar to the appetizer in that it was very bland.  We were expecting delicious Italian food and received nothing special.  My fish was extremely over cooked but the server was very helpful in getting me a new dish.  I tried the Primavera and was pleasantly surprised.  It was very good.  

We tried the cheesecake dessert and the lemon cake and both were delicious.  

Unfortunately the food was nothing that would temp me to come back especially for the prices you pay."}
{"text":"I really like Minneci's. The food is great. Though I generally get the Italian Beef because it's huge, warm and delicious, I've tried a few of the pasta dishes and they've been pretty good (though a bit small). The garlic bread is to die for, though often it doesn't seem like there's enough. The atmosphere is also nice; it's quiet and well lit. A great place for a date, for instance.

The problem that we've run into is the service. The last time I went was with a big group (we were celebrating our graduation) and the service took three hours. The poor waiter appeared inexperienced, and accidentally whacked me in the glasses with a salad dish. I don't really fault the poor kid for being thrown into the situation, though, and I also don't fault him for the kitchen being unable to prepare our food in a timely or reasonable manner. It was a weekend, we called ahead for a reservation by a day or two and the restaurant wasn't crowded. The service should have been better. 

I'd go back to Minneci's if I had a hankering for Italian, but I'm not sure I'd schedule anything afterwards."}
{"text":"We dined alfresco on a Sunday evening in June. We were the only people outside. It was our own private place. Our server was on the ball and attentive but not annoying. The manicotti in meat sauce was awesome! I will seriously get that every time I go. Salad was typical as was the g.b. Wine was decent and reasonably priced. I grew up in a very Italian area and I honestly found this food to be up to par."}
{"text":"Wow, what a disappointment. My fianc√©e and I met with Rob the owner on April 29th for a tasting to plan our wedding reception dinner. Tasting went great, the food was delicious and Rob was attentive. We made some menu choices and Rob said he would get back to us the next day with a sample custom menu and prices. To this day he has not called us back or emailed a response. We called several times and emailed him, still no response. We have given up on Rob, at this point we can't trust our special day to his irresponsibility.

*Update:  this comment was removed after I posted it the first time.  It would appear Rob does not want the negative comment on Yelp, but still refuses to contact us and be professional about choosing not to host our wedding party.  I am reposting to help any other couples considering Minneci's for their special day.*"}
{"text":"We held my parents 50th anniversary celebration in the private dining room.  The service was fantastic and the food was excellent.  Our family has high expectations for Italian food due to our own family recipes.  We had a variety of entrees (lasagna, ravioli, pizza, chicken parm, meatball sandwich, pizza) and every dish was rated as really delicious.  Salad house dressing is tasty and the garlic bread and rolls were fresh and warm.   Thanks to the chef, Charlotte and our friendly, efficient servers for helping to make the dinner as special as we had hoped.  Best wishes on your new location at The Crossing."}
{"text":"Love Minneci's!!  It's a friendly, down to earth family restaurant that serves delicious Italian food.  Everytime I've went (usually during lunch time -- it's cheaper then) the owner has greeted us at the door and been extremely accommodating.

The food is good, authentic Italian.  The marinara sauce is delicious.  And each table has packaged crackers and breadsticks, which I enjoy snacking on while waiting for the meal to come. Free appetizers are free appetizers, no need to be picky, folks!

Give this place a try for a romantic date night, it's nice to visit a small family-owned place from time to time instead of going to all of the chains on Prospect. blah"}
{"text":"My team had a great dinner here one night. The atmosphere and the service were both extremely pleasant. 

The meatballs that we shared as an appetizer were enough for 3 people to get a good taste. My toasted ravioli (a heavy dish, to be sure) was very filling and satisfying."}
{"text":"apparently this place is under new ownership.... and you can tell.  the dining room is still dark as hell and a little dated, but the food was much, much better.

we had one coupon left to use, and company in town who don't like \"adventurous\" food.  i figured this was the perfect place.  the food here was pretty close to cafeteria fare the last time we dined here, so it seemed as far from adventure as i could get.  

we ordered, and we were surprised.  while the food still wasn't gourmet or super fantastic, it was so much better than it had been in the years before.  it seemed fresher, and not as if it had been just popped into a microwave moments before it was served to me.  most of the food tasted like it had been cooked 6 months prior to my eating it.  it was really, really not good.  this was much, much better.  

while i probably wouldn't come back, because it's still sort of expensive for what you end up getting -- i don't think it's as terrible as i once did.  it's still not great, but it's better."}
{"text":"This is hard to rate coming from the Chicagoland area, so I just averaged it and went with 3 stars.  If this restaurant were in Chicago, I'd give it 1 star.
In Champaign with no decent sitdown restaurants around, it might qualify as a 4-5 star place.


Service was absolutely outstanding.  The server really made our dinner a wonderful positive experience with his excellent service.   He went out of his way to bring us whatever we needed and was very attentive.   He was great.  (Knowing he was most likely a college student, we made sure to tip him double what we'd normally tip.) 

As long as you understand you are not in the Chicago area, then the food is good and you'll be happy.   

We had a very unique appetizer that we've never seen before that we all loved. It was a side of chopped tomatoes (mixed like a bruscetta mixture a bit), and another side of delicious green olives, and it came with sliced bread.     I thought it was a really neat concept.     

I had the Chicken Marsala, which included about 4 pieces of chicken.  It was very good, full of flavor.      The side of pasta wasn't the best pasta sauce I've had (tasted tomato-pasty), but again it's Champaign, IL.   It was edible and not bad.

WARNING:  Do NOT order the Pizza!!!!    We ordered the Pizza Marguerita..   It was by far the worst most discusting pizza we've ever had.    It was like tasteless cardboard with extremely heavy cheese that you couldn't pry off, with no tomato sauce on it.      It was unedible by any of us at the table.      I know I've heard the expression not to order Pizza outside the Chicagoland area, and now I see why.    We did send it back and they removed it from our bill no problem.


Unless other options become available, we would go back.    
The service made it worth it."}
{"text":"eewww okay minecci's used to be really good, but then it changed ownership a long while ago. I only went there once since then new ownership, and it was for prom with a large group of people. They had a lot of people there that night, so i understand a lot of stress with the wait staff and kitchen. But that doesn't excuse the fact that our waitress was pretty poopy to us, and got really testy the entire time. 

When the food came out, I was surprised by how it tasted straight out of a chef boyardees can. I ordered some ravioli, and after i waited a LONG time for it to come out, I was very disappointed. I tried someone else's dish, and it wasn't any better. I heard from someone else that they had a pretty good experience, so maybe it was just that one night. They need to get back to the original menu when it was under the last ownership, it was much better!!!"}
{"text":"Summer 2012. Came here after a ceremony and it was not good. The salads had been refrigerated (frozen?) beforehand and were not done thawing. The food was of the microwaved quality. Our party wasn't that big to where everything had to be made the day before was it? Come on Rob, is your campaign for political office keeping you out f the kitchen? Charlotte's not doing much these days, let her help."}
{"text":"I was really disappointed in this place.  I was hoping that, perhaps, there was a good local Italian restaurant in the area... 

I ordered pasta in an Arrabiatta sauce. It was so salty it was unbelievable. I add salt to just about everything, but this was bordering on inedible. 

For what I got, I thought the meal was way overpriced. The portion was large, but the food itself wasn't very good. $17 for something eh.

My date ordered the manicotti... it looked like the stuff you buy frozen at the store with some Ragu on top. 

I hate to be so severe on a small, locally owned business, but seriously, taste your own food!"}
{"text":"After three years in Champaign I finally went to Minneci's because I got a restaurant.com coupon - $100 off if you spend at least $200 total.  Four of the six people in my party were first timers.  We all heard mixed reviews and I was starting to get dubious because of some bad reviews on Yelp.

I don't know why people are so down on the place.  The only bad thing was zero parking at 6pm on a Friday night.  It seems pretty popular.  There were some families with younger kids, but mostly it was adults (we were all 25-30 yr olds).  We got to try a lot of stuff because of our coupon - we ordered 3 bottles of wine, 4 appetizers, six entrees and two kinds of dessert.  Not a huge wine list, but all the wine we ordered was pretty good.

The meals are neither cheap nor expensive for a sit down Italian restaurant.  There are $30+ veal dishes, but most pasta/chicken dishes are $13-$17 and they give you huge portions of pasta.  I can say for certain that four of the six of us really loved our meals and I'm pretty sure the other two liked theirs fine.  Entrees come with soup or salad and garlic bread.  The garlic bread was mediocre, but my clam chowder was good.  The mozzarella sticks, eggplant and meatball appetizers were all good, but the shrimp scampi (really overpriced at $9) was only so-so.  The spumone gellato and irish cream bash desserts were both amazing.

Waitstaff were friendly, professional and attentive, even on a busy night."}
{"text":"Had the calamri it's was really good & the waitress was really nice about the whole I hate tentacles thing so she asked specifically to not have any in the dish. Husband had shrimp coctail it was good but price was a little high. Good minestrone soup! Entree was spinach tortalini pretty good. Husband had pizza sandwich & liked it. Desserts tiramsui & canoli were really good.  Waitress was really nice. We will go back!"}
{"text":"Great pastas, great bread, great service.  Best Italian place in town!"}
{"text":"Ambiance and location are good but the food tasted a little bit too salty. I am not too picky about my dish and it was an OK experience. I personally think you can get better food quality for the same price in Champaign through other Italian restaurants."}
{"text":"I would not recommend the new site at the Crossing. I went two weeks ago to try it out and halfway through the meal I found hair on my plate. I received an apology & free appetizer. Thought id try it again with fam (4) and friends (5) after church. 30 mins after our order was made we got our salads and 1st refil on drinks. The syrup wasn't working on their soda machine & instead of an apology we got a \"we know\" statement. Got our food an hour after order was placed. Seemed like an acceptable time prActice for the wait staff. It was not a busy time for them either ad there was only 2 other tables of guests. The food was ok & i like the decor. I downloaded yelp just so that I can warn everyone about this experience."}
{"text":"we were feeling very lazy last night and didn't even feel like changing out of our workout clothes to go out to eat, so yes, we probably stunk as well.  But at any rate felt like we could have dinner here and nobody would be offended.   this in fact was true.  
being raised on authentic sicilian food, i sometimes just want the basics done right.  that's what you get here.  no frills, but good marinara sauce over whatever pasta you want.  
the owner greets you at the door and will speak to you in Italian if you wish.  our waiter was a very sweet college boy who did a great job.
nice university crowd mixed with some locals...anyone could be happy here."}
{"text":"I don't go to Minneci's often, because it is expensive, so I consider it a rare treat when I do get to go. That being said, I know what I like there, so I usually order the same thing. I highly recommend the spinach tortellini with meat sauce--it's so rich and wonderful! Definitely get it with garlic bread, and if you really are a fan of sauce, ask for extra. The salads are sparse and bland, so don't fill up there. Wait for dessert! I'm telling you, you won't find a better cannoli in town. These are the desserts of the gods. I am speaking here with the utmost seriousness--if you miss the cannoli, you won't understand why this place deserves at least 4 stars. In fact, the only reason I'm giving Minneci's 4 out of 5 stars is because of the sad attempt at a mojito I had there recently. The time before last, I had a mixed drink and it was excellent, but this mojito must've been made from the tears of a despondent bartender; it was so watery, I could barely tell it had any rum in it. Basically, avoid the mojitos and nosedive straight into the cannoli and you'll be golden.

I've also tried the homemade cheese lasagna with meat sauce and the pizza margherita, and they are both excellent. As far as pizza goes, this is pretty decent stuff. It's not the best you'll find in a swanky Italian joint, but the fact it has fresh basil on it is a major step up, in my book.

Minneci's didn't used to accept reservations, but they do now, so if you're headed there on Valentine's Day or another holiday, definitely call in advance."}
{"text":"Went with a group of 6 (not my suggestion, but the company was good so what the hey). We were relegated to the back room and forgotten for 15 minute intervals, leading to the predictable results of empty water and drink glasses. They only had 4 types of salad dressing: Italian, creamy Italian, ranch and bleu cheese. No Caesar. WTF. I also do not think they employ busboys.

Since last time, they have reprinted and probably rehashed the menu. The pasta dishes were 'fine', except the meat lasagna which was good. My linguini with clam sauce was fairly poor. One guest's steak was done just right. 

One thing that has improved is the wine. It is much better than last time, and the prices are good for the quality. Get drunk and the food will taste better."}
{"text":"I went to this restaurant because I need to use my restaurant.com $25 certificate there, since it is one of the two restaurants that participate in restaurant.com network. I didn't really want to go considering only 2 star yelp ratting. However, I have to say it is much better than my expectation, at least the lunch is not bad. 

The lunch menu doesn't have many choices, just some pastas and sandwiches, around $6-$8. The pasta comes with bread and either soup or salad and the sandwich comes with chips. The spaghetti I ordered was enough for a very hungry man. The taste, well, not authentic, but not bad. 

My friend who also visited there before likes the dinner steak there. Maybe I will just stop by sometime later. 

I would like to give it 3 or 3.5 star. But since other reviews are too bad, probably just give it 4 start to support."}
{"text":"This is our first visit.

Really bad food and below average service. Food is terribly bad,  most likely frozen food. Sauces are canned, no bread served on table when you are seated, packaged crackers, really packed crackers instead of bread. Sides are pretty low average too. The bread is served with entrees and tastes like card board. 

Definitely a \"never again\" place."}
{"text":"The food here is quite good. We have yet to be disappointed, and it is refreshing different than the chains like Olive Garden."}
{"text":"Best Italian restaurant in Champaign-Urbana.  Great food, great atmosphere."}
{"text":"LOVE LOVE LOVE Minneci's.  We've been here several times and it's always the same.  Basic, old school Italian. My daughter loves their pizza and my husband and I have never ordered something we didn't love.  There is always more than enough for a meal so we have lunch the next day  The only thing I haev to remind myself is the house dressing is super tart, but everything else is wonderful."}
{"text":"My husband and I have visited Minecci's many times. We have not sampled their pasta dishes, what we have had is tasty. Our go-to is lightly battered cod topped with marinara sauce and a few kalamata olives. It could do without the breading, but it is very good nonetheless. Soup has always been good. Salads are plain, but serviceable. The one gripe I have had with their food is their veal parmigiana. I thought it was pretty cheap for veal and there is a reason for that. It is ground meat, not a filet.

The atmosphere is certainly dated and a bit dim, but I think it feels like a little family restaurant. The decor seems to be in good condition. It is not meant for an urbanite's night out, just a comfy spot for a low-key date or small family celebration."}
