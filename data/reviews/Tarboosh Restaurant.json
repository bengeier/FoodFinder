{"text":"Came here for my birthday and we all shared a few appetizers: falafel, foul medammes, fried eggplant, and kibbi. One of us got the falafel sandwich but it wasn't anything special.

The appetizers were great and they were made fresh to order! Each order come in a plate with fresh salad and tahini sauce. Appetizers were served with a lot of pita bread but again, nothing special. Food was nice and hot when served and it really reminded me of home. 

Afterwards we had Arabic tea with cardamom and it was lovely, just add sugar to your likely. 

Overall, it was filling and yummy and I will probably come again!"}
{"text":"Been going here for almost 20 years. The food is consistently fresh and good quality.  I normally stick to the veggie buffet though sometimes it leaves a little more to be desired.  It's a good value though."}
{"text":"My friends and I have been coming here for over 15 years. It's a great place to gather and enjoy a wonderful meal together!

The Chicken Shawarma plate is excellent, as is the Falafel, just to name a few. 

Also, the garlic sauce is everything you want it to be! Not like some of the 'garlic' sauce you can get from some places that have no flavour."}
{"text":"Worst service ever!  Food was good, but man, the workers need to develop some people skills.  I had asked for water, waited 15 minutes, then asked again and was given a dirty look.  I asked if there was a problem, and the waiter said you don't need to ask twice.  I only had to ask after I waited 15 minutes."}
{"text":"Food was sub par. Shawarma meat was sitting cold with the grill turned off.  Worst of all the owner Bas was exceptional rude."}
{"text":"Like a Harvey's of Middle Eastern -- clean, modern, well-stocked and fresh.

The only place in the immediate area that I've found to be populated and have fresh shwarma spinning at noon on a Sunday.

I had the falafel plate for 8$. The portion of falafel and rice was generous, but it also unexpectedly came with a monster side salad and a pita. Recommended.

Debit accepted. Not sure about MC/Visa..

P.S. Also has a big breakfast menu, but I haven't tried yet. $5 big breakfast looked good."}
{"text":"Falafel was fresh, crispy on the outside, soft in the inside.
Ordered chicken shawarma platter and the mixed grill platter which had one of each chicken, beef, lamb skewers. (With the choice of 2 sides for each platter)
I don't know what else to say other than that it was the bomb.com.
So good. So tasty. Prolly the best middle eastern food I've ever had so far.

I went on a wed night. It was not busy at all which was quite surprising but it was great that we didn't have to wait long.

I am definitely gona come back when I'm craving for some falafel and shawarma. 

Bless the Lebanese people for the food."}
{"text":"This place is great for Falafel and Shawermah, however if you need the good falafel and the owner not in duty at your visit time, you have to tell the employee: you need your falafel well done, because only the owner do that by default. It's weird right ?!
Simply, Good Falafel = good cooked"}
{"text":"Always great food, fresh family affair I been coming over 20yrs. Very reasonably priced. The ambience is not fancy, but staff/family very courteous and food is great. Best falafels."}
{"text":"I would give this place 4 and a half out of 5 stars. When it comes to taste and quality, this restaurant has been exceptional over the past decade. We have been dining here for well over 10 years and the foods quality and taste has never deteriorated over this period (fortunately). This is simply exceptional from a restaurants perspective and it definitely says a lot about their owners(have never met them). 

Yes they are closed on Sunday's so watch out for that. But In terms of pricing and food quality they are above any middle eastern restaurant in the GTA. In Mississauga this restaurant is definitely my favourite middle eastern joint. I would put this up as the best middle eastern restaurant in Mississauga. Seriously it's so underrated , yeah places like paramount and the ton of middle eastern kabob joints which are around sauga are nice but this stands out on my list. One should definitely give it a try.

Here's what I usually order:-
1 hummus 
1 tabouli 
2 chicken skewers
2 lamb skewers 
Pita"}
{"text":"Best falafel in Mississauga, but my favorite is the beef shawarma. Great selection for vegetarians and vegans. If you are interested in authentic Lebanese food this is the place to be, one of the originals in Mississauga."}
{"text":"One of the best shawarma places in Mississauga, if not Toronto. I dare you to try their Beef shawarma. Simple, fresh, clean and decently priced. Ask for extra garlic sauce on the side, it's complimentary."}
{"text":"Took the family to enjoy some Mediterranean food after hearing of this Alternative to Paramount.  We found the food from the menu to be average and the service non existent.  They have some young kids working there who are just overwhelmed by the traffic and keeping up with everything.  Ofter. i had to ask for water refills several times or waiting for bread half way through your meal.  Will not be going back."}
{"text":"This is got to be the biggest rip-off I've ever eaten at! Save your money and don't go here.$9 for a steak shawarma which couldn't even feed a five year old child."}
{"text":"My friend catered from them for a dinner. The lamb and rice was delicious. Also the chicken and rice was very good too. I would cater from them myself. No pictures sorry presentation was great. The food came in big aluminum trays which is easy to warm up with lots of roasted nuts on top of the rice."}
{"text":"Excellent food and service! Food is so authentically good fresh and tasteful. The staff are so friendly and accommodating. They were so nice to my neice and nephews and gave them candy bars when we left. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"If you are going for a wrap or sandwich... It's pretty good.  Meat was flavourful.  But as a full dinner out with side dishes.. Expensive and bland.  Skip it and go to your good local shawarma place around the corner.  Half the price and same taste."}
{"text":"Best Fresh food and amazing service. It may take some time as they make it fresh. worth the wait and much more than value of money. I am a customer since 2008 and eat there twice a week."}
{"text":"Excellent Lebanese food in Mississauga. And you can take out as well. Sandwiches are great. Having time for a good lunch, try the combination plates. Homus, falafel, tabulis, rice, kibbis are fantastics."}
{"text":"We were passing through Mississauga in ON, Canada and came across this Lebanese restaurant Tarboosh. The location was a bit confusing first because it is located inside an apartment building or something. As soon as we found the way in we were welcome by the owner herself. We were seated and we ordered food. The owner offered the appetizers on the house.  Hummus, falafel, salad and bread were all very tasty. Then the entree came it was delicious too. It tasted like home food. The meat was tender and delicious. We were so hungry we finished our platters and had no take-outs.  Thanks to the wait staff and the owner for excellent service and tasty food."}
{"text":"We ordered a mixed grill plate along with chicken shawarma wrap along with rice. The wrap was fresh and chicken quality was good., my favourite part of the plate was the chicken kebab, the beef skewers were good but lacked flavour. The few things that could be improved, was it took about 20 mins for the food to be ready and the naan was cold. It would not be my first choice for this cuisine type but would return if I was in the area. Service was good overall."}
{"text":"This restaurant was a bit challenging to find as it in inside a mini-mall of sorts. The parking is at the back of the building and you walk through the doors and up the stairs and that's the entrance to the restaurant. 

Once we got inside, I was honestly surprised by how clean and welcoming the restaurant was. We took a seat at a table and waited to place our order. 

All I can day was that the it was excellent service and the waiter was very kind and professional. He repeated our order back to us to avoid confusion. We got 1 soup, 1 kibbi, 2 sandwiches and 2 kebabs (chicken and beef). 

The first thing to come out was the soup - which was absolutely delicious. It wasn't salty in the slightest and felt very healthy - it was a lentil based soup. Oh, and to top it off, they gave us an extra soup for free since they had extra remaining! That was unexpected and extremely kind. 

The next things to come out were the kibbi and kebabs. To our surprise - again - they gave us an extra kibbi as they had leftovers! Wow. Way to make a good first impression. 

The last to arrive shortly after was the sandwiches - I got a chicken shawarma. 

The food was absolutely delicious! I enjoyed every single dish. I wasn't planning on dessert, but based on how good the service was an the quality of the meal, I decided to try a pistachio baklava. I later found out that this was made in house and it was tasty as well. We had ours warmed up (thanks to the waiters recommendation) and enjoy it. It was sweet and the portion was fairly big. I suggest getting one for every 2 people to share it. 

Overall, I will be back here and have already told friends about this restaurant. It was one of the best dining experiences I have ever had and I appreciate that the waiter took the time to deliver top notch quality to complement the top notch food."}
{"text":"Super friendly service and the food very fresh , the place is not that fancy bit old style but in general great experience totally enjoyed it"}
{"text":"Finally!!!!! 
We found the best shawarma in town. 
Chicken shawarma was the closest so far to the ones I have in Lebanon.. and it is white meat (not the dark meat you eat in all other places)
Same thing goes for the beef shawarma, You can taste the quality and freshness of the food. 

Update. 
Well, this is still the best shawarma place in the GTA. My recommendation is the following:
Chicken shawarma sandwich: put only the chicken with  galric sauce and french fries
Beef shawarma sandwich: beef with tahini sauce and parsley. Ask them to have the tomato grilled.


Lebanese recommended :-)"}
{"text":"I went and got a chicken shawarma and my girlfriend got a falafel plate, the service was good, food was good, would 100% go back. I used to always go to paramount, but I'd rather this place, it's family run and I feel like they take more pride in their food than a chain."}
{"text":"Amazing, friendly service and delicious, fresh food. Laid back atmosphere. I've come here for the buffet a couple of times when I visited Mississauga. It was great. The only reason I didn't give it 5/5 stars was because I found the hot buffet a little limited: only four hot items plus soup, and two of the hot items were nearly identical white rice. So really, only two hot item choices other than the rice. I only liked one of them so I ended up basically eating rice and one hot item, plus salads. But hey, it tasted great so, I'll be back:)"}
{"text":"Don't let looks deceive you.  The inside of this restaurant is quite nice, but the outside can be quite scary. It's in a corporate office building that looks a bit decrepit, and the entrance to the restaurant is a bit weird, but don't let it deceive you.  It's looks really nice on the inside.

Anyways, onto the food.  This is Lebanese food and they have a vegetarian lunch buffet for $10.49, which includes a few types of rice, pita bread, hummus, an assortment of salads and some cooked veggies.  All the food was hot and fresh and it tasted very good.

However, it's hard for me to eat just veggies, so I also got a chicken skewer. I have to admit, the chicken was juicy and fresh and well seasoned which was around $4.

Not a bad place to visit for lunch, though service could improve."}
{"text":"This is a place I frequent often. Their mixed grill is always delicious, pita is never dry out and their falafel is crispy but never greasy. The ambiance is always quiet, casual, and decor is classy. waiters are attentive and frequently checks on you. The weekend vegetarian buffet is sometimes a hit or miss but for the price of $14.99 it's worth a try, at least once. The Baklava is amazing, my favourite is the cashew one but my friend who always goes with me loves the pistachio. The con would be the magic vegetarian sandwich sometimes is too oily but other times it's ok."}
{"text":"I went here with a friend and we both had the shish tawook sandwich. Simply delectable! We were quite surprised by how flavourful it was. Service was reasonable.

Over all, inexpensive and delicious."}
{"text":"Got here at 10:15 and they refused to seat us saying they close at 10:30, while their website and yelp and google says they close at 11."}
{"text":"Still the best and cheapest lunch in Mississauga. A falafel with hot sauce only three dollars. You can never go wrong with that"}
{"text":"Had the chicken shawarma plate and it might be the best chicken I've tasted in the GTA....with takeout they put the chicken in a take out soup container but its plenty enough chicken, not a fan of the hummus, too much tahini, not enough lemon and salt and the tabouli wasn't that great either, the parsley not chopped enough"}
{"text":"Sadly the only experience I have had here was being turned away from this place while their hours listed them as open.
We got here from pretty far as we were craving middle eastern food and reached the restaurant by 10:15.
The server(there was only one person) said they are closing in 15 minutes and would only do take out now.

Their official hours on website and google is 11:00pm. It doesn't mention that  dine in would be closed earlier, some restuarants do close their dine in half an hour earlier which makes sense, not 45 minutes earlier and closing your restaurant half an hour before the official time is bad business practice.

Honour your hours please!"}
{"text":"I've been coming to this location for lunch for a few years now. Service is always fast and food is tasty. Lunch hours are always busy but never seems to slow down service. My last visit here, there were many kids running around (which I don't mind) but I did see one child playing around at an empty table unsupervised, and was putting the salt shaker in its mouth. Grossed me out. Nonetheless, food is great here!"}
{"text":"Tarboosh has been around for a very long time and the quality hasn't changed since I remember going there over 15 years ago. If you're just looking for a good place to take out or sit down, this is one of the best options in the surrounding area. 

I strongly suggest the beef or chicken shawarma. I would say the beef shawarma is one of the best I've had in Canada (plate or pita bread). The ingredients always seem to be fresh and I'm a big fan of their garlic sauce. 

My only reservation about Tarboosh is I'm not the biggest fan of their hummus. Other than that, Tarboosh is a great place and I would recommend it to anyone."}
{"text":"Pretty good, slightly overrated, only heard about this through the glowing Yelp reviews..  Tried a few different things, ranging from a shawarma wrap to a falafel vegetarian platter.

Falafels were pre-cooked (although well cooked).  More spongy and less crispy on the outside than I would like, but the flavor was good.

Tahini had a bit of a \"soured\" smell to it, when I opened the container.  Not sure how normal this is.  Taste was okay, I just used very little of it for dipping

And, never thought I'd say this, but the tabooli salad has way too much tomato and onion and not enough actual parsley.  Sounds like this could maybe be a good thing but it creates a strange unbalanced flavor that I did not like or expect

I'd give it a 3/5, sounds appropriate, but I will update as I plan on returning and trying more things"}
{"text":"Hidden gem in East Mississauga! Not many people know about Tarboosh but if you're looking for authentic tasting middle eastern street food then look no further! They have delicious vegetarian options as well!!"}
{"text":"I give this place a 3-3.5. This restaurant has been here for a couple of years now and i never got the chance to visit. Last weekend was my first time.

There's parking at the back and the entrance is around the building, but you can go through the building and go up a few stairs and it will take you to the front of the building. The entrance is quite tricky, its a little door in the corner.

The restaurant looks very nice inside. There was no customers in the restaurant on a Friday night then they start coming in around 8-8:30. We were greeted right away and told us to pick wherever we wanted to sit. The menu had a wide variety of grilled meats and vegetarian dishes. We ordered the beef shawarma on hummus and a chicken shawarma platter with tabouleh and fries. Our glass was never empty, they made sure it was always filled. The hummus  beef shawarma came with pita. The dish was great but after awhile the beef is noticeably sour due to the overwhelming lemon marinade they used, that also went for the chicken shawarma platter. The chicken was also a bit dry. the tabbouleh was great and fresh. Fries was tasty and crispy! 

Their arabic coffee is tasty and super strong, Its comparable to turkish coffee. Overall this place is OK, i'll give it another try and order something else."}
{"text":"Terrible experience as they served us cold chicken shawarma and we waited for more then 45 mins. Not worth the price and would not recommend anymore."}
{"text":"There's nothing more I could add to the other reviews as this place has amazing beef shawarmas!  I'm by no means claiming to be a shawarma aficionado but I have tried many, especially out in Scarborough and this place reigns supreme.  First of all, the meat is top quality, as are the toppings - very fresh and prepared with pride.  Nice clean place, friendly service and open late on the weekends from what I understand."}
{"text":"This place has been there for a while, hard to get in there since parking is at the back but the food is amazing. They also make their own hot sauce, and even sell it in bottles. 

Shawarma is amazing and price is reasonable. Also they have cheaper take out prices."}
{"text":"I travel a lot for work and I must say this is some of the best Middle Eastern food I've had in the last 10 years. The hummus was absolutely fantastic.  Seriously, you must try it as an appetizer. I had the falafel and chicken platter and have absolutely nothing negative to say about my dining experience. All of the food was fresh, the service was very good.  I felt extremely relaxed and greatly enjoyed my time there.

I can highly recommend this restaurant!

I went up to pay my bill and discovered that the owner of the restaurant was actually working in the kitchen making some of the food. I was pleasantly surprised and complimented him on my excellent evening.  It's also so nice to know that the owner of the restaurant cares that much about his product!

Go eat at this restaurant!!!!!"}
{"text":"We have been going here for years as a family for dinners and special occasions. The staff is really friendly and the food is always fresh and tasty. The reason for the 3 star review and not higher is that ITS NO SHAWARMA PALACE (ottawa) but its the best I have had in the Mississauga area. The beef shawarma is especially good with their yummy tahini sauce. They have a great option for getting the salad bar and ordering your shawarma meats on the side. Its very kid friendly and the parking is pretty simple."}
{"text":"Fresh tasting delicious kabob plate. The service however was quite slow. Would come back again."}
{"text":"I visited here after reading numerous glowing reviews. Although it took nearly 10 minutes for anyone to take my order (with only 3 dinner patrons in the restaurant), the food was extremely tasty and of high quality. Their moderate vegetarian buffet ($13) serves as a great foundation for a meal with salads, lentil soup, hummus, rice, and both hot and cold vegetable dishes. Meat or falafel appetisers can be added for a fuller meal, though this pushes the price above $20/person. I recommend this restaurant and will return."}
{"text":"This place is great for pickup food and sandwiches. This is not  dine in place.
They have the best beef shawerma in the GTA. The chicken shawerma is good too but they use 100% white meat which makes it too dry but if you are looking for a healthy sandwich then it's your best choice. Also the falafel is amazing ! 
I'm not a fan for the rest of thier menu but all over its decent if you want to try something else.
Sum it up get beef shawerma sandwich with 6 pieces of falafel and your choice of a drink."}
{"text":"Great food for a good price. I love their falafel sandwiches and kabobs are amazing!! Will come back again"}
{"text":"My favourite middle eastern meal.  Every bit as good as mom makes!  Best tabouli you can get anywhere. Great staff."}
{"text":"Another family run spot in Cooksville, Tarboosh looks to be a busy family affair that has it's long term customers saying it's great.  With the suggestion from Yelp, I decided to give it a shot to see how it could compare to my food adventures when I was in Dubai.

To start, I would say the restaurant is housed in a pretty run down building... it clearly is old and the parking lot looks like something out of a 'wrong side of the tracks' feel.  The inside of the restaurant is ok... aged and worn but fairly clean.  The interesting thing about it is the wooden designs all over the place that reminds you of the ceramic mosaics I saw in Middle East.  It also has a large painted mural of what would be a stereotypical desert scene with men riding camels.  

You can call it in for take out or dine in with a vegetarian buffet on offer or do menu dishes.  EVEN if you don't call it in, the take out speed is quite good!  I did this and I have to give credit where credit is due.  They made my falafel fresh and hot in less than 10 minutes from order.  THAT is good!  

So their menu reads quite typical for a Middle East restaurant... shawarma, kebabs, meze with pita, and falafel.  I've been dying for a good falafel... it's been far far too long since I've had them in Dubai.  I feel Toronto is missing the falafel spices to make an excellent one.  Ordering here is pretty easy and the service is friendly enough to take it and run with it.

Falafel - I would say these are quite different from the ones I'm used to.  For starters, I loved how these were just fried fresh and given to me hot within 10 minutes.  That made me happy.  The texture these are quite different... they're fluffy with their outer shell delicately soft & crispy.  I'm used to outer shells that have a great crunch that gives way to a moist soft inside but still has a mild chew.  It's quite a different take.  I would say the taste though... it's missing spices.  I tasted some coriander but it was missing salt, cumin, garlic... onion.  Something.  It was a bit bland.  3/5

Chicken Shawarma - The best item we tried.  These were still moist and the flavour was good... lemony without being too tart, well seasoned, and had a bit of nice char to give it a more smokey flavour.  I would say that these would be good in a pita or just on rice.  I did find these nicely tender.  Definitely their stronger item on the menu.  4/5

Hummus - I found this similar to the falafel... just missing flavour.  Though it was smooth, it didnt have a strong taste.  If anything, it had a tiny subtle taste of tahini and thats it.  It needed more garlic and salt... maybe a bit of cumin to liven it up.  Something.  Though it probably is a good filler... it was a bland filler. 3/5

Tabouleh salad - This was a decent rendition of the traditional parsley salad.  They did chop the parsley finely enough so it didnt feel like you were chewing on branches and it had enough citrus to bright it up.  The tomato were out of season but it added to the juiciness of it.  It could have used a bit more mint or onions but it's not a bad salad.  3.5/5

Overall, I like the speed of them making items fresh and I found the place to be genuinely warm.  I just didnt find the flavours as bold as I know they can be from Middle East so I'll keep on searching for that spot to make me fondly remember of Dubai."}
{"text":"My experience:
I went here for lunch today and ordered a beef shwarma and a chicken shwarma. Both were about what you'd expect for size and quality for under $5 each. Service was friendly and I was in and out around 5 mins with my take out.

The food:
The chicken I did find was the better of the two (as I usually do find with most mid eastern spots) The chicken shwarma's are made with all white meat, and as with all places that I've come across, you can choose what to put in it. My only issue with the beef ia it's not as flavorful as the chicken. But not to say that it's bad in anyway, it's just a personal preference on taste. Next time I go, I want to try one of their combination plates out. Those range from the $10 - $15 and include 2 side choices.

The verdict:
I would definitely recommend Tarboosh as a place to try especially for lunch take out as the prices are very reasonable for what you can get in this area and the service is excellent and friendly."}
{"text":"I used to eat here when I worked in Mississauga and I miss it! We recently met friends in Mississauga and ate here. It was a great as I remembered! Wonderful! Don't miss the Lentil Soup! It is great! Their lemon tahini potatoes are wonderful. The buffet is wonderful. The staff are friendly! They are now selling their tahini. It is so delicious. 

They have vegetarian and non vegetarian options so everyone will find something they love. I wish they were closer to me!  I am see the reviews on the Shawarma so I am looking forward to trying it next time."}
