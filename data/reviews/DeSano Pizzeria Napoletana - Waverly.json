{"text":"The best pizza! Wonderful atmosphere and friendly staff. Came with a group, so got to taste several pizzas. Each one was awesome! They  had several beer and wine choices to pair with their menu.  Great for date night or kids night!"}
{"text":"I enjoyed my night out at DeSano. I was excited about the newness and the location. The pizza was fresh, hot and authentic."}
{"text":"So happy to finally have an excellent pizza restaurant in south Charlotte! The service and pizza was excellent. We have a toddler and it can be difficult going out anywhere. She loved watching the pizza makers toss the dough and even playing with a piece of dough herself! We ordered the lasagna pizza and it was delicious!! Would be awesome if they could get a delivery service going. For now, we will definitely be frequenting this restaurant on our \"pizza nights\"."}
{"text":"We have been to DeSano's Waverly location twice now. The first time was very early on a Monday and it was quiet. The service was very fast and we enjoyed it. However, all three of us felt afterwards that there had been A LOT of salt in the pizza. None of us are normally very picky about salt or even notice it, but we were all gulping water all night. We made a second trip there a couple of weeks later on a Saturday night. It was completely packed. There were no open tables, but a nice couple offered to share their table with us. The food was again good, but afterwards, we had the same experience with salt. As someone who never notices salt levels, I wonder exactly how much salt is in their pizza. Hoping the manager can respond and tell us if they add extra salt, where they add it, and how do we order it with less. We'd love to come back again."}
{"text":"Desano Pizzeria is hands-down, the best Charlotte NC area Naples-style pizza and is right in the heart of walkable Waverly, near Whole Foods. FRESH ingredients, directly from Naples? Wow. I always get my San Gennaro \"slightly overdone\" in the wood-burning oven with a bit of a char on the crust. Great, great vibe in this very cool space and perfect for a family night out. Outdoor patio for authentic Napoletana-style pizza and then walk around Waverly for an ice cream."}
{"text":"This place is delicious but the prices suck. A large two topping pizza is about $26 after tax. Also they don't do more then two toppings on each pizza. Apparently it's so expensive because they get all their ingredients shipped over seas from Sicily. Either way, I would never pay this price for their pizza again. It's good but not $26 good."}
{"text":"I really wanted to love this place because it is so close.  I have been 3 times now and the food tastes very good.  We have had the Margherita pizza twice.  It is delicious but there are 6 slices of pizza and 4 pieces of basil.  I thought maybe the first time was a mistake but second one was the same.  Also, the first time we ordered the Formaggio Calzone which you can add toppings to, they added spinach for me.  The second time they told me that it is not one of their toppings and cannot add it.  They have to be consistent with their other locations, which I understand, but why do the other locations not offer it.  I have never been anywhere that has calzones that does not add spinach, especially when they have it at their location.  Good food but so many choices in Charlotte where I can get exactly what I want so I probably wont go back."}
{"text":"This is the best pizza we've had in a long time. The people are super nice, super friendly and the pizza is amazing. It's our new favorite place!!"}
{"text":"Food was amazing! ....nutella pizza is literally to die for. The bartenders are soooo nice and make incredible drinks as well! All of the staff was nice qnd very accommodating! I would recommend this place!!"}
{"text":"Simple, clean, great pizza.  We had the large Margherita pizza and a small Bianca.  The margherita, as prepared, was perfect.  I broke up the fresh basil which complimented the cheese and sauce very well.  While I added a small amount of grated cheese and pepper flakes to one slice I ate most of the pizza with no modifications.  The slight garlic and oil flavors came through in a subtle well measured way.  The Bianca pizza was good though it is not my style.  My wife really liked it.  The kids also loved the margherita and wanted more.  We have been to a few \"handcrafted\" pizza places in the are but none have really hit home for us until DeSano.  Parking in Waverly is not great, but we arrived early enough to get a spot.  We had no wait when we walked in.  Service was helpful and friendly.  There was ample seating and the tables did not feel cramped.  The food arrived after a few minutes.  At first we were surprised not to have plates, but it works fine.  The pizza crust was crispy and not easy for the kids to cut with the plastic knives.  It took a bit of work to get smaller slices for them.  No big deal in the end.    The food was great and we left with some leftovers.  It is not often we leave a restaurant already talking about our next visit, but that is all we talked about for 5 mins after leaving DeSano.  Delicious!"}
{"text":"The pizza was great and the space was perfect for my one and three year old. We celebrated my daughter's birthday there and she had a blast and felt very special."}
{"text":"Great pizza, open atmosphere, high ceilings and a full bar. Good family environment. They figured it out. Our new pizza joint."}
{"text":"Brought my family for a birthday celebration. The staff was great. They put us in their private room and were very attentive all night. Thank you James for a wonderful evening. Michael the manager checked with us several times and made sure we had everything we needed. Pizza and cannolis were excellent. Will definitely be back and highly recommend."}
{"text":"Fresh. Delish. Made in a huge open kitchen while you wait in you bistro seat.  There's a bar also but there's no drink fountain, only bottled drinks.  Large TVs to pass the time.  Casual and friendly."}
{"text":"I was impressed. The pizza was delicious. I ordered the DeSano and the garlic really added that extra zest. While I'm not a huge fan of charred pizza crust this was not overwhelming.   I will be back."}
{"text":"The pizza was very good; had the Margherita and the Desano.  Service was better than expected for a new restaurant; both pizzas came out within 15 minutes. The Desano was a bit salty, but still good.  I'd put Desano a half-notch below Inizio; Inizio has a superior red sauce to Desano and better flavor integration in their Margherita. Both places are far, far above the mass market Papa John's across the street, but at roughly twice the cost.  My go-to pizza for this area is still Lorenzo's, but their service quality has declined markedly in the past two years."}
{"text":"Great food quick service. The pizza was so good 2 of us inhaled it and wanted more.   They are working on appetizers.  But I think they will be just as good.  Cannoli was a great dessert to end the meal.   Will certainly be back.  Wanted to go back the next day in fact..."}
{"text":"Wow!  Great pizza and excellent add to the waverly / south Charlotte region.   The staff is super friendly and they go out of the way to ensure that you have a good experience.   The GM was working almost all roles from what I could see and her hands-on leadership appears to make this place buzz and come alive.   We will be back soon!"}
{"text":"These days, so many pizza restaurants call themselves \"Napoletana\". I always wonder what they mean, because many of them don't serve le pizze Napoletane, but just fancy pricy food. They don't even have marinara on their menu.  I was excited when I found a pizza marinara here. Of course, I ordered it. Obviously, it wasn't popular, because the lady at the cashier asked me if I knew what it was and if I really wanted to order it.  My pizza was stiff so when I picked up a piece, it didn't get warped but stood straight. Sauce was dried out and looked like tomato paste. Where is my fluffy, juicy pizza marinara?  Maybe I picked a wrong day.  By the way, there were sacks of farina stacked along the counter. A customer put her toddler on, and let him walk and jump on them. Staffs knew what the kid was doing, but didn't stop him, saying \"we love kids\". I hope the farina is for display only.  I think I will give it a try once more, but not marinara."}
{"text":"Best pizza in the world I love it and come here so much they know me by first name...not ashamed this pizza is so good I even recommend the meat calzone it's awesome too. Service is great especially the manager he is excited about a great product they serve he is very educated on it and will answer any question you have. Don't be embarrassed to ask it is def like no other pizza and the names can be hard to pronounce or confusing but the pizza is good and he will help you along with helping you understand it. I hope you come here and give it a try you will be hooked ...every one I sent has said the same thing \" I go all the time now\""}
{"text":"Fantastic, authentic Neapolitan pizza experience. You're greeted by a cavernous room with family style tables, the pizza is just like you get in Naples, fresh ingredients amazing taste. Staff is friendly and professional and there's a full bar to compliment whatever 'za you get. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"We ordered a pizza and spinach salad. Pizza was decent but not great salad was good. Restaurant was empty on a Monday night. Food was served on cookie sheets and plastic silverware. Food is a little pricey."}
{"text":"Pizza taste really good...but, maybe that's because no one is wearing gloves and throwing the Pizza Dough from one side of the kitchen to the other. Witnessed the Manager checking his phone and not washing his hands before continuing food prep."}
{"text":"Food was ok once we finally received it. We waited almost and hour for 1 pizza. There was only 2 other tables sat when we went and somehow they forgot to make our pizza. When someone finally came over to us, they asked us what we ordered and then said that they will give us 10% off next time we come. No thanks, we won't be back."}
{"text":"Having traveled to NYC and Chicago a lot, I have to say the DeSanso-Waverly location was the best I've had! Top notch service, great bar, fantastic staff and the pizza! OMG!!! Soooo good!!! I give this place a 100%, A+, 5 star, perfection rating!! It's hard to find such phenomenal food teamed with such great people running the place!!!"}
{"text":"Service was great but we ordered a margherita pizza added mushrooms and meatballs. The pizza was bland and had no basil at all and no garlic. We didn't even take the leftovers home! We'll give it one more chance...but this was very disappointing! Edited to add screen shot of their private message response to me. Needless to say we won't be going back!"}
{"text":"Don't do it. DeSano's served us a pizza with moldy cheese. Please see the picture. No excuse. And after presenting these pictures to the management team, they offered no response. Therefore, beware that your pizza may have moldy, expired or stale ingredients. No excuse for poor service after providing an unsafe product. Go somewhere else."}
{"text":"This is, without a doubt, the best pizza place in the greater Charlotte area. I found it through my boss, and the first time I went here, I was blown away.   These guys cook your pizza at 900 degrees for about 90 seconds, and it gives the pizza a crisp crust but a soft underside, which is perfect.   All ingredients are fresh, and to top that off they serve Mexican Coke with real sugar. The service is outstanding. All the managers and employees go out of their way to make sure your experience is an excellent one.   Overall, I'd highly recommend this place. Delicious."}
{"text":"We love #Desanos!  The ingredients are fresh and they can customize or order to fit both our vegan and meat eater family members!  So glad they opened in Waverly!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch today and was surprised that it wasn't mobbed. I'm sure it's only time before word spreads! My friend and I split the Spinach Salad and each ordered a small pizza of our own. I had the Diavola pizza and it was delish, but we could have easily split a pizza too! The portions are generous. The only downside, in my opinion, are that there are only two salad choices and the drinks come in bottles, no fountain drinks. They do offer free water though. My meal (I paid for the salad, my pizza and a bottled Diet Coke) was nearly $30. Pretty steep for lunch, but the ingredients were fresh and quality."}
{"text":"I had a calzone at the bar.  The food was very tasty but the center of the calzone was Luke warm.  Service was weak at the bar where I spent most of the time watching four bartenders talking with each other.  After leaving my credit card on the bar to pay my bill I had to ask one of the other bartenders to run my card.  I'll give them another try."}
{"text":"Great customer service!  And good pizza!!! Just missing the ranch and pineapple, which are pretty important!!"}
{"text":"I love this place! Fresh pizza straight from real ingredients from ITALY! It's a clean restaurant with staff members who are friendly. This will now be our go-to pizza place since it's closer than driving 30 mins one way to Concord Mills.   It's in a great location and I highly recommend the sausage and pepper pizza. Along with the canolis."}
{"text":"Ok pizza. Too dense and chewy but toppings we're good.  No plates, just dirty metal trays"}
{"text":"First time here and the pizza was good we had caprese salad to start and it was fantastic   I think it's only the 2nd day open and they have some bugs to work out. It was cold inside. And the place was not comfortable   We will definitely try again when it's warmer  also two thumbs down with the cookie sheets for plates and plastic forks and knives"}
{"text":"So glad this location opened up on this side of town! You can really taste the difference in the quality ingredients that Desano uses in their pizza. I'll admit when I tell friends about this place I have to advise them of no split toppings on the pizza but other than that it's great. Get the meatball pizza!"}
{"text":"I've written like 2 reviews including this one, to add context to why I'd write a review.  Giving 5 stars because their pizza is fantastic.  They don't have ranch for some reason, which is, I guess because they want to be authentic to what they do and that bastardizes the pizza somehow (you northerners and your blue cheese.. I get it, but it's not always better) , but in my opinion, it's nice to have that as a dipping option at times.  Other than that, LOVE the pizza.  Their pepperoni somehow has a better taste than other spots, not sure what that is but it's great.  Sausage is amazing as well.  My fiance and I have come here a few times and lamented that there aren't more people in the bar area..  Come for the lasagna pizza if nothing else.. please support these great pizza locations! I've literally tried every single pizza place in Charlotte since I was 5 and this place comes to mind at the top of the list when I'm ordering."}
{"text":"Stopped in here at Desano pizzeria after a long flight and on my way to the hotel. Food was delicious, hockey was on TV. Couldn't have asked for a better situation. Staff was very friendly and service was very prompt. Great special selections too by the way!"}
{"text":"Everything was fantastic!   The sauce, pepperoni, and sausage on my pizza were so amazing and tasted phenomenal!! It was a Friday night at 6pm and they were busy but my pizza came out in a very reasonable time!! I will be back for sure to try out more!!"}
{"text":"Well, Inizios has some competition with Desano!! I honestly like both but have to give an ever so slight nod to Inizios because their crust was a bit better.  But don't get me wrong,  this place is very very good too.   We got a small margehrta with sausage and onion for me and da missus and the boys split a large Bianca. Both were very good but I think the margehrta crust was just not puffy enough but the Bianca looked spot on(5/5). Simple order at the register and 90 seconds or so later and Walla...pizza!   Staff was friendly and came and checked in on us too (5/5). Highly recommend!!!"}
{"text":"Waverly...Wow you were so needed..We have such a huge need for restaurants in this area! So glad this has opened. Huge Pizzeria!   Not so impressed with the seating. I do not want to sit at a Picnic table, very few real tables and chairs except for high ones. Very similar to Innizio's with the high temperature wood burning ovens. Order and they bring the Pizza to the table. Very busy Friday Night, we did find a table to share with another couple we did not know. Ordered a Large Pizza Bianco. A small station with Cheese and fresh garlic and some oils. No Calibrian Peppers though. Missed those ! Pizza crust was done perfect. Nice topping of basil and ricotta. Needed a little more spice. Had a glass of wine and one beer. Came to around 40 dollars. No Subsitutions what so ever....that is irritating to me. We are the consumer. We pay, we need to be able to have some say in what we do or do not want.  You eat it right off the tray. I would have liked a plate.  Pretty good Pizza just needs some tweaking."}
{"text":"Desano's @Waverly. Time to \"cheat\" and I opted for a regular full-on gluten pizza   First time here. Ordered the Margherita pizza with oregano cooked in it.  WOW! Crisp, fresh ingredients, just the right amount of oil and simply delicious. Couldn't ask for anything more...coming from this NY Italian woman! I will go back! 5 BTW.... M-W, 2 LG PIES + BTL WINE:$50 That's 16 slices ÷ 5/6 ppl = less than  $5 per person! Great deal!"}
{"text":"The pizza was the closest to what we had while in Rome and around Italy.  Loved the atmosphere, full bar, and seeing her ur pizza being made from dough to end.  Managers came by to check on us, and customer service was great.  Only thing I would like to see different, is to have a Sosa fountain instead of buying a bottle at a time.   Definitely recommend, especially for a family meal, because kids love watching the pizzas being made."}
{"text":"I got a message from the owner Scott and it was one of the nicest, most responsible notes I've ever received from an owner. We'll definitely return to Desano's - not just because the pizza is awesome, but because we must support great owners that are engaged and understand what drives loyalty. Cheers Scott. Best wishes to you and your team."}
{"text":"Added this restaurant to my favorites list immediately!! The pizza was fresh, they carry amazing beer (you must try the Islander Ginger Beer), friendly staff, excellent service, and clean restaurant. The picnic style tables were perfect for our large group. Excited to have a new place to put into rotation!!!"}
{"text":"The best pizza we've had in such a long time! The crust was delicious and the pepperoni on our pizza was perfectly crispy! The restaurant is clean and spacious and the staff was attentive and fun! Real family vibe going on here! Be sure to grab a drink from the bar to complete your experience! It's a 30 minute drive from our house and we're already planning our next trip!"}
{"text":"Pizza is absolutely AMAZING here! Fresh and flavorful! Brick oven made. No substitutions but was pleasantly pleased with how the pizza came as is. Staff was very pleasant and great."}
{"text":"I hosted an event at DeSano tonight, and it was terrific! The service was excellent, the food was delicious, and the venue was lovely! I can't say enough about how accommodating the team was from the managers to the bartenders to the kitchen staff! Give it a try!"}
{"text":"Best pizza I've had in Charlotte.  I'm from Long Island and I've been in Charlotte for 20 years.  This pizza wins.  The place is very family friendly with lots of room and plenty of family style tables.  Right out side there's a green space which is great for the kids to run around on.  There's a fountain which is a big hit with our 2 year old and our 3 year old.  This is place is definitely going into our regular rotation."}
{"text":"Extremely disappointing. Customer service was basically nonexistent at the counter.  The cashier barely acknowledged us after chatting a few minutes with a coworker.  After stating that this was our first time patronizing the place the cashier looked bothered to explain the menu.  There were limited topping choices and the sauce was bland.  Sorry... it's a nice looking place but not impressed enough to return."}
{"text":"Disappointing. High hopes for this wood fired pizza place, but very disappointed. Add-on items for pizza were expensive, then very scarce once we got our pizza. Crust was most disappointing, taste wasn't very good even with the wood-fired cooking. Place was extremely loud, sound kind of echoed it seemed."}
{"text":"Pizza is great, HOWEVER they charge 22.00 for a one topping, 16 inch pizza and guess what....they are serving 14 inch pizzas and getting away with it. I have now had pizza 4 times here, all smaller pizzas then what they advertise. Total rip off and scam."}
{"text":"Brought the girlfriend for dinner on a weeknight. No lines and great service. The place is pretty new to that location so the word is probably still getting out. Tons of seating available and the tables are mainly all hightops which is cool. Separate bar on the other side of the restaurant makes ordering drinks simple. My now go to pizza place."}
{"text":"Nothing earth shattering. Average in every way of a corporate pizza chain inside. Food is fine and is a little overpriced. But it's nice to have a better safe pizza option that isn't named papa johns or dominos."}
{"text":"Great stuff!!! It's not a cheap pizza place, but quality comes with a cost.... the simple Margherita is delicious! The fresh grated cheese is a great addition. There's a full bar and they're very attentive as they're newly up & running. Our family will be frequent visitors. The Bianca is pretty incredible too - fresh ingredients and definitely fresh garlic. my son loved the oversized glass Fanta bottle and guzzled it in no time. Parking stinks, but I'm Waverly there's nothing you can do about that. Check it out before it turns into crazytown in that parking lot."}
{"text":"Pizza Perfection! Imported Italian '00' flour (extra fine summer wheat), San Marzano imported sauce, real pecorino Romano, and real, imported Bufalo milk (water buffalo) mozzarella. All that baked in 900 Deg. Neopolitan, wood burning ovens blessed by a priest. If you like your pizza crispy like I do just ask to leave it 15 seconds longer in the oven. I'll never go anywhere else for pizza!"}
{"text":"Still a great Napoletana style pizza. It used to be much better. Now it's run by teenagers and the quality definitely has gone down some. Hopefully it will go back to it's original quality."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is very nice. There are three flame ovens where you can see the chefs make your food. The room is open which is really nice. The food tastes great."}
{"text":"Burnt food. Poor customer service.  Would not recommend. We've tried it twice and will not go back."}
{"text":"Pizza was tasty but DRY......needs more tomato sauce......also they put buffalo mozz on pizza along with regular mozzarella which they call scamorza (fancy name for regular mozzarella)......I was disappointed with that!   I would prefer all buffalo mozzarella at the prices they charge!   Overall I will try place again and see how it is the second time around....pricey for what you get......oh I hate the ridiculous HUGE metal trays!   They take up waaay too much space on table with large party of people!   Really are these necessary??????????"}
{"text":"The special ovens at DeSano Pizzeria cook your pizza in 1 1/2 minutes. From oven to your table in 5 minutes!  This is a family, kid friendly restaurant.  The kids watch the chefs toss pizzas and the restaruant gives your children dough to play with at their tables.  Thin crust pizzas with the freshest ingredients.  There are high top to low picnic style tables, and TV's to catch a ballgame.  The bar is located in the back of the restaurant.  You may have to ask a waiter or venture over to the bar to get a 2nd beer.  Order at a counter then pick your table.  Until you are familar with the menu, take a few minutes to review the selections before ordering.  The location at Waverly is adjacent to the childrens park.  This will be another plus when spring arrives.  Mr. DeSano thank you for bringing your pizzeria to Charlotte.  The best pizza in town.  (2nd location uptown)."}
{"text":"From the moment we walked into Delano pizzeria we felt welcomed. Austin went above and beyond in making us feel welcome. He suggested the Bloody Mary's which were wonderful and was personable as we waited for our pizza. I would highly recommend DeSano!"}
{"text":"Delicious Pizza and Meatballs!  The crust is thin on the pizza and sauce for both the meatballs and pizza was in the top two of Charlotte.  Prices were reasonable for the high level of quality.  This is 4.5 star restaurant for pizza!"}
