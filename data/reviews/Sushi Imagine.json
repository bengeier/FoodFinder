{"text":"This is a small but great place. I tried lunch there and was very pleased with the lunch menu.  Look at the $5.00 weekday lunch special."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places to eat. Yummy food and great service, what else can you ask for? On our recent visit the server suggested the sardine sashimi because it always sells out fast. When she brought us the food, she thoughtfully recommended how best to eat the sashimi so the garnish stays intact. Having waited tables all through high school and college, I really appreciate thoughtful servers.   If you don't mind having an early dinner, I recommend going between 5-6. You get $1 off every food item!"}
{"text":"Super nice staff. Sushi chef took our order directly from the counter and checked in on us throughout the meal. Very fresh and lots of variety of sashimi and sushi rolls on the menu. Have to check out the \"add'l menu\" on the whiteboard next time."}
{"text":"Best sushi in Vegas! Came thirty mins to close and sushi was phenomenal"}
{"text":"I really loved the fresh sushi here and the family who owns it was very nice.  I will be back."}
{"text":"I was there for lunch a couple weeks ago and got the chicken lunch special. My mother got the same thing along with a spicy tuna roll. The chicken was undercooked and pink. I didn't notice because of the sauce and luckily I didn't get sick. The spicy tuna roll was good though, and the service was ok. You can't beat the prices."}
{"text":"Sushi was really good!! Service was great & the staff is very friendly. Love the wheel spinning...great way to keep your customers coming back, other than the amazing food."}
{"text":"Great service! Barely any wait time. Royal Philly and caterpillar were my favs. They also have a fun wheel to spin at the end."}
{"text":"Im considering trying this place out a 2nd time...maybe tonight was just a bad night for them. Service was way to slow for a sushi bar, my date and I got full off the drinks, edamame and gyoza. The staff was so nice but I just can't get over how log we waited for a plain chicken teriyaki roll... ill update this review next time :((("}
{"text":"We had a detour and wound up here. Sure glad we did! I'm a fan of small mom and pop shops. The food is so fresh and the atmosphere is pleasant. It's not AYCE, but so worth it! My \"go to\" roll is the Tiger and I'd have to say it's the best in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Let me preface by saying the server was sweet and very accommodating. I had my children, one in a stroller, and she pulled the hostess stand out of the way so we could fit at a table. She brought out a sippy cup of water and kid plate for my daughter, a nice gesture.  I ordered a salmon skin cut roll, firecracker roll (salmon, ponzu, spicy scallop) and a chicken teriyaki bowl. Everything was par except for the firecracker roll. I wish I would've taken a picture, it looked disgustingly old. The salmon was a slight purple color and the \"spicy scallop\" looked like a pepto bismol mush. It hardly looked edible. Then squirts of sriracha on top, in no order or technique, but rather like when you squirt mustard over a hot dog but the mustard is running out. Aesthetically ugly. I took a bite and the entire piece was cold. BINGO! It was premade and left to die in the refrigerator until someone ordered this gem. Unacceptable for an $11 roll.  The service was good, the food besides the rip-off roll was prepared and plated well. The atmosphere seemed like it would be a fun place for a date night, small tables and a sushi bar. The firecracker roll, however, needs work and from a restaurant owner who takes pride in his work, in every roll."}
{"text":"I come here often for lunch, the lunch specials are delicious and the portion is quite large considering through price. ...  If you are nearby, this is a sure thing. ..."}
{"text":"We like to go here every week.  Authentic Japanese sushi.  Aki, the famous sushi chef, totally rocks, as well as his family who run the show. Atmosphere is warm and friendly.  A small and cozy place, We always meet new and interesting people, here.  You'll want to try everything.  Good luck when you spin the wheel.  Came here on Friday, best meal ever"}
{"text":"This is my favorite place to go!  Aki, Chako, and their teen aged kids are so friendly and the sushi is the best. It's fresh, delicious, creative, and so beautifully presented. Aki is a Beatles fan so if you are, you have much in common. Do sit at the bar and enjoy."}

{"text":"I live right down the street from this place, and I used to work in this plaza, so I have seen many places come and go in this spot in those years. I was really excited, however, when I saw that we would be getting a new sushi place so close to home, and I have to say, I hope that this place sticks around.   My husband and I actually went the evening they opened and we weren't disappointed. Everyone was so friendly, and the food was delicious.  We've gone back several times, both to dine in and take out, and the service is always excellent regardless. Even when waiting for our take out orders, we are offered free tea or water.   The prices are reasonable very reasonable for what you get, and I would definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Delicious!  And easy on the wallet compared to other good sushi joints.  Very small, quaint yet comfortable location.  Glad we have another option in Henderson - especially one that my kids enjoy too.  We'll be going back."}
{"text":"The service and food have been excellent for me every time. Vegas has a lot of sucky service but this place is not one of them!!\""}
{"text":"Great addition to neighborhood. In smiths/mcdonalds shopping area next to star bucks on Valle verde/paseo verde.  Fish very fresh and sauces were amazing. Very friendly staff. Great quality at decent prices."}
{"text":"Great quality food. The cuts were very nice. The service was outstanding! He's going to need a larger restaurant soon!"}
{"text":"Delicious food, friendly service, great values. It's a good decision waiting to happen. Imagine it."}
{"text":"Great hidden gem! This place will be our sushi joint from now. Sunshine roll was very creative and Hello kitty roll was spicy done right. Unagi melted in my mouth. Glad we found this place!"}
{"text":"came in for lunch on a Monday. I was coming back from checking out Hoover Dam and didn't want to go to the strip for some sushi. This place's Happy Hour deal was a bonus. The sushi was on point. Friendly usual customers as they came in and greeted the chef. I overheard they said it is their favorite sushi spot. Glad I came in. The people next to me had this interesting appetizer that I never seen before but they said definitely try it next time. It was kiwi, spicy salmon, cream cheese and some other stuff on a lightly fried wonton skin from what it looked like.   When I come back to Vegas area, definitely would come back for more. Not really into paying for over inflated priced sushi on the strip."}
{"text":"Best sushi in Vegas. Served by Itamae Aki, everything is excellent. If you're in the 89012, this place deserves a visit. Don't miss the specialty roles listed on the wall (they are hand written in size 5 font so sit to the left at the sushi bar if you want to read)."}
{"text":"Big Wheel of Fortune!   Much better than other places in town. I'm not too adventurous in my sushi taste but I like it to be good. The rainbow roll melted in my mouth. $60 for 6 rolls and a couple of appetizers. I'll be back. Also I won 20 Sushi Imagine Bucks on the Wheel of Fortune."}
{"text":"Chef Aki takes great care of his customers.  Excellent, attentive service, intimate space, inventive  rolls (love the Beatles theme) and fresh, delicious sushi/sashimi.  The fact that it's about a 10 minute walk from the house inspires us to eat healthy and get out and enjoy green valley even more.  Love this little place - you won't be disappointed!  Spin the lucky wheel to earn freebies for your next visit."}
{"text":"Pretty good food for the price.  I will go again when I am in town and try some other rolls.  Nothing knocked my socks off, but it is hard to find good sushi in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"One of my favorite sushi restaurants. The best and friendliest service! Wonderful family that owns the place, and it's always very clean.   My husband and I go a couple of times a month. The fish always tastes fresh and we've never had a roll we didn't enjoy here. Our favorites are the Rock & Roll, Hurricane-Ahi, Playboy and Tiger Rolls.   Also, they have a happy hour where all rolls are a $1 off from 5-6 on week days. Great deal!"}
{"text":"Cool concept with the Beatles theme, and uniqueness of sushi rolls.  Also the wheel spin after the end of your meal is a creative and fun way to get people coming back.  I've had better sushi, but the experience is great!"}
{"text":"If your looking to feast on sushi i would not recommend this place. Very small selection of sushi rolls and no all-you-can-eat option so you rack up a big bill in a hurry. The saving grace was the sushi chef was nice and artistic with his creations. The chicken appetizer marinated in ginger sauce was like a not very good Asian KFC. Did not get a chance to try but the udon noodle dishes looked like they had potential..."}
{"text":"Service and food was very \"ok\"  nit bad, but to pricey in my opinion."}
{"text":"Amazing food!! You definitely got to try magic carpet and spin the wheel. Very friendly staff!"}
{"text":"Friendly staff and decent fresh sushi. Screaming orgasm is pretty yummy - almost as good as I Love Sushis (which is the best). Spinning the wheel is lots of fun and a great gimmick."}
{"text":"I moved to Henderson 3 yrs ago and it was just the first time I've dined here. Pretty amazing my first time coming here. The staff is awesome, very friendly, never had to ask for a refill. The cucumber salad was fresh and crispy, I love the sweet and tangy. I ordered the tempura and it was nice and crispy. The shrimp was sweet and fresh. But Oh MY the teriyaki steak was to die for! Melted in my mouth! Really great experience, can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Our 2nd visit to Sushi Imagine, and we are still in love. Upon entering the sushi chefs and staff greeted us enthusiastically, as before. This is just one of those home-feeling joints where guests are always made to feel welcome. Our kudos to staff, thank you! Jalapeño bomb starter lived up to its name, bomb diggity! Husby had the miso soup, delicious though not extraordinary. Next, the highly-revered Hello Kitty--still our favorite. The Spider roll was delicious and the presentation gorgeous. However, we were disappointed to receive just 5 pieces rather than the 6 to 8 received in other rolls. The spider roll is one of the few soft shell crab items on the menu, and it is delicious. The Crazy Mexican--spicy tuna, jalapeño, cream cheese, avo, cilantro etc--had beautiful flavors, but we did not realize the tortilla wrapper until after receiving. We both agreed we would likely further  enjoy this combo w seaweed wrapper as opposed to tortilla. Husby was still hungry so we had shrimp and veg tempura, EXCELLENTLY done, and the dipping sauce flavorful. We had a coupon from our last wheel spin for a free large sake ($5.50 value) and it was very much appreciated. We will be back."}
{"text":"So I came upon this place by accident. It's got an actual Japanese feel to it. It's cozy and warm and busy!!! I think it's an entire family working here because they feel like family. Anyway the food was delicious!!!! I'll definitely come back. And the prices are about average. Next time I'm going to spin the wheel!!!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I decided to check out this place out for Valentines Day, we hit it up for lunch to avoid the crowds. We made reservations, it's a very tiny place so we thought to be safe we should.  The lunch menu is smaller than the dinner one, mainly just sushi. There are no vegetarian choices on the lunch menu, which is why I only gave it 4 stars. The larger dinner menu though I did see more options. So we went with sushi. We ordered 5 rolls from a super awesome waitress and didn't have to wait too long to be served.   The place is tiny so you can hear everyone's conversations. Everyone was very friendly, the sushi chef was very talkative and talented at his job.   The sushi was amazing! We were stuffed after the rolls. They gave us a small Valentines Day discount on top of the sushi being on a lunch price sale! Which was cool since it was a holiday places usually hike the price up.   The service was fast & friendly, and the sushi was the best that I have found in Henderson. I will be returning!"}
{"text":"Great little place. I never knew that this place existed until we saw it outside the McDonalds window. We decided to later try it out. Very small place, but the staff is very friendly. Their sushi menu isn't that big, which was ok because I wasn't too hungry. Everything came out in a timely manner and looked great. The fish was fresh and everything was delicious. One thing that stands out is for every $30.00 you spend, you spin a big wheel and you get x amount taken off your next bill. That's a pretty cool concept, but you have to use the coupon within 20 days. Overall, great first experience and definitely will go back there again."}
{"text":"Sushi Imagine is NOT like eating a bunch of poison!  Imagine this; A sushi bar that is adorned with a tasteful amount of Beatles swag on the walls. Off to a good start already. Saturdays are reserved for Beatles only music while the rest of the week you can hear anything from Aerosmith to Zepplin playing in the background. This place is a non-ayce place which causes you to be more thoughtful of your choices as to not have to take out a small loan in order to pay your bill since you're used to eating as much as you can stuff down your gullet at other places. Don't misunderstand me, this place is not expensive at all, we're just jaded a bit in this town with sushi prices based on the ayce model.   This place is refreshing! Small bar and dining that makes the quaintness of the place cozy as opposed to cramped. The Service is Superb! You feel as if you are a guest rather than a customer.  The quality is exactly what you'd hope to find at a REAL Sushi Bar. Top quality ingredients with great attention to detail not only with Chef Aki  mastering his craft but from the kitchen staff as well. Chef Aki's rolls are very artistically done with much pride and enthusiasm as you might be able to tell from photos (try the Hello Kitty Roll).  The bonus to this place is their daily lunch special. Each day of the week has a different Bento Box Special  priced at just $5. McDonald's across the way can't match that price. So glad this place is close to home, just disappointed it took me a year to find it. If you're lucky enough to spend $30 on your visit you get to spin their wheel at a chance to receive Imagine Cash ranging from $1-$50 usable on your future visit."}
{"text":"Alex the sushi chef is on point.... Love this place after a GREAT golf day.  I will be back as long as Alex is serving Sushi. I approve this message JK KUHL..."}
{"text":"A pa and ma place. Its not AYCE but it has quality. Place is very small. I like there sushi, fish are fresh, good portion although the slice is quite small. Sauce is delicious. Cool presentations of the special sushi rolls.   I thought its gona be pricey but its decent  Will definitely come back."}
{"text":"I ate here tonight and let me tell you, I've been to so many sushi joints and this is exactly what I've been looking for. The UNI was so fresh! Yellowtail, salmon omg it was literally like \"buttah\". If you're looking for the restaurants where the waiters give you attention but not tooooo much, if you're looking for the calm friendly environment, if you're looking for the freshest seafood..it's here!"}
{"text":"Excellent service and great food. The owner Loves the Beatles and I think his favorite is John Lennon by the name of the place... So there was definitely good classic rock playing, like the Beatles and Joe Cocker, I even heard a song from the Monkeys . It's has a nice menu and the fish was really fresh. The owner was our sushi chef and his son was back there working with him. I love family owned businesses and you can tell he cares about his customers.  It's not fancy at all, but it's clean and very authentic feeling... I went with my daughter and she loved the place too."}
{"text":"I love this place so far. Nice atmosphere, nice people, great flavors, and a cute spin the wheel game. A while ago I got a bunch of takeout sushi here that was delicious. I came back with my mom today and we shared a ton: rock and roll sushi, veggie tempura, gyoza, sashimi, and more. We were such gluttons the only photo I got was of the tempura and salad. Everything else got inhaled pretty quickly. I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"1 week ago I would have given this restaurant 4 stars for good Japanese food at a reasonable price point. It is with deep regret that I now give them 1 star( zero stars if I could).  Right after we ordered tonight, we heard a loud, wet sneeze from one of the sushi chefs. The kind of sneeze that has a bunch of snot and phlegm. My sister looked at the sushi chef expecting that he was going to wash his hands. I, again, regret to inform you that he did not!  He did not even pretend to. Way to prepare raw fish for your customers- probably one of their sauces' secret ingredients.   I would love to tell you that things were fine for the rest of the dinner but I can not lie to you. Just as I was almost finished with my cooked salmon dinner, I noticed a thick strand on the underside of my salmon. I initially thought it was a thin bone. Again, I regret to inform you that it was not a bone but a 2 inch long thick black hair.  Seriously like an overgrown coarse pubic hair. No joke. When I told the waitress about it she apologized and removed the charge from our bill. I asked her if they wore hairnets in the back and she said no. I asked her if they would start and she looked at me like I was crazy. My sister told her about the sushi chef sneezing incident and she didn't seem concerned. Crazy ! No idea how they are open."}
{"text":"Good food, but food was room temperature. I like the sushi to be very cold. Very small inside. Wonderful service , full of smiles. Good prices"}
{"text":"You know when they have ume shiso on the menu they're legit Japanese!!! This might be my new go-to spot :-) the staff that I interacted with was very nice and sweet. The Ambiance is welcoming. It is a smaller sushi bar and several tables. Need to come back to eat in :-)"}
{"text":"Stopped in with the GF for some sushi and found SI to be a delightful sushi experience.  There is plenty to choose from and the staff was warm and inviting."}
{"text":"The super white tuna is delicious. Excellent nigiri. Fresh produce and friendly service."}
{"text":"I tried Sushi Imagine for lunch, I have yet to go there for dinner. After yesterday's lunch, I'm really looking forward to it.  After drooling over some of their food pictures, I decided to head there to try their famous Sunshine Roll. However, after looking at the menu, it would've been foolish to not take advantage of their lunch specials. Tuesday's $5.00 lunch was grilled mackerel & kara-age(bite-size fried chicken) including salad, rice, & miso soup. I settled for their 3-piece nigiri, tuna, salmon, & shrimp with California Roll. Accompanied with miso soup, also. $5.95. Great deal, I thought. Fish tasted fresh and yummy. I'm not sure if I looked at the kids menu, because they had a regular chicken teriyaki bowl special for $2.99. I ordered that for my son and we shared everything. Our bill = $9.56. Nice!   Moms of toddlers: it was ultra cute when the server brought my son an adorable kid's plate, that came with matching fork & spoon!  It's a small place with only about 5-7 tables and seats at the sushi bar. The staff  greeted us warmly and our food was served fast. Our server was very nice, I did notice she forgot my water. No big deal since I had brought a water bottle for my son. That is overlooked if my server is smiling.. and remembered my extra wasabi! Other thing that was noteworthy was she seemed hesitant when I asked them to substitute my shrimp nigiri for something else equivalent. They did...just was hesitant, it'd make me wonder if they are very open to substitutions. I'll see when I go back!  I glanced at their rolls and dinner combos. Rolls were priced about the same as other sushi joints, and dinner combos had a big variety to choose from.   I'll write an update after trying their Sunshine Roll my next visit. I just had to say I thoroughly enjoyed my lunch there!"}
{"text":"Does anyone know why Sushi Imagine closed so suddenly? We hope and pray for the family that owned and ran this amazing Japanese restaurant. The food was always amazing and we were always greeted with smiles and good cheer."}
{"text":"We went for my sons b-day was seated quickly. Great service for a party of 6. Ordered Alot of sushi. Everything came out perfect.  Going back soon."}
{"text":"Good sushi, yummy miso soup was tasty as was the seaweed salad. I had too rolls, both were brought quickly and were fresh. Cute little neighborhood joint. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"STILL my favorite sneak-away lunch date with my husband! Of course, sometimes we bring the kids and they love it, too. When they aren't with us, the Sushi Imagine family asks about ours. Don't miss this gem!"}
{"text":"I love me some Sushi Imagine during lunch time.   They have $2.99 California rolls, $2.99 teriyaki chicken bowls, and $.75 drinks! As well as, $1 off any sushi (including rolls) and a lunch special of the day and a lunch menu...I could go on and on and on.  Everything is fresh, the sushi comes out quick, the wait staff is amazing. I believe if you spend over a certain amount of money, you get a free spin at some prizes. However, I am a cheapie and I never order enough to do a spin. The only, only, only, thing missing about Sushi Imagine is that it is not an AYCE restaurant! Womp, womp!  +1 star for colorful straws."}
{"text":"I love Sushi Imagine!! We recently moved to Vegas from LA, and we were anxious about finding a good sushi spot. My sister introduced us to this place and it doesn't disappoint. Their attention to detail is superb, not only do they remember us, but they make space in the coolest spot of the restaurant because we have kiddos in tow! They have kid friendly cups and utensils, and are wholly attentive... And did I mention the sushi?! It's delicious!! Perfectly spicy, unique rolls that will please even the pickiest eater.  Lastly, they have a wheel to spin where you win money or prizes toward your next visit! We always have a blast spinning the wheel, while the restaurant cheers us on! Kid friendly, delicious, and affordable. Dooooo it!"}
{"text":"Tried it.  Sssaaaaiiihghhhht.  Fish is as fresh as any other neighborhood place in town is.  Meaning, Americans are too stupid to know the difference.  Nothing I ate had super stank face.  It's a decent enough spot but I personally found it lacking.  They had a ton of \"special rolls\" which were written untelligibly on a white-erase which might have been written in heiroglyphics.  Horrible marketing.    I got to spin this wheel.  Top price was $20.  Not 20%.  $20.  So much potential wasted.  The top prize is the price of a standard lap dance?  Fuck that.  The wheel is fun but offer something good or dont do it at all   As far as the food, Id classify it as standard Vegas neighborhood sushi with an extended wait period and too much \"mayo.\"    Seriously I ordered salmon sashimi on a greed salad and was horrified to see the asian mayo on it. Thats not japanese, that's just stupid.  YEAH IM A FAT BOY but wtf.  You dont put mayo in a fucking salad-a!  Would I return?  Nah."}
{"text":"Yummy! We went there for my birthday after reading many reviews on Yelp & it met all expectations. Love the small space & really good music plus the fish was so fresh & delicious. The chef is so skilled & the hostess so gracious. We think we made quite a find! Adrienne S."}
{"text":"We love this place! It's near our house and has great, fresh sushi! Many roll options and even has a non-sushi menu.  It's family owned and operated, which I always like to support.  The owner/sushi chef is very friendly!  It is small, however, so I'd suggest a reservation if you have a big party, but with 2 we can usually find a seat at the bar."}
{"text":"A true locals spot!! My fiance found Sushi Imagine on Yelp & after reading all of the raving reviews we just HAD to check it out for ourselves.  We were greeted warmly as soon as we walked in. It was pleasantly busy and we soon found that it was filled with many repeat customers - all super friendly, chatty and willing to recommend their favorite rolls!  We had the Monkey Brain appetizer, Rattlesnake roll, Hello Kitty roll & a few nigiri pieces. Everything was incredibly fresh, delicious and very well presented!!  We earned a \"spin,\" which was a fun way to end the meal :)  We'll definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"Something, LoverSoul, Hurricane Rolls are delish! Also te halibut is always good here!"}
{"text":"This is our favorite restaurant in the area--sushi or no.  The staff is incredibly friendly.  The sushi is incredible.  It is a small place with lots of charm.  You get to spin the wheel after your meal, which makes it very fun for kids as well.  We are moving away, and we will greatly miss the food and friendly atmosphere here."}
{"text":"Imagine wonderful, fresh sushi, creatively prepared and served by a sushi chef from Sapporo, Japan - right here in Henderson! Sit at the sushi bar with Aki for the best tuna, salmon, yellowtail, whitefish and albacore. Or, have Toshi serve up the ultimate in beef teriyaki (rib-eye). Imagine that at $6.95! The same quality and decent prices are found in all the combo dinners which combine chicken, beef or salmon with tempura and kara-age, bite-sized fried chicken marinated in ginger sauce. The rolls are spectacular and delicious. There's soft shell crab, Hawaiian poke, baked mussels and more.  Lunch from 11:30 - 2:30. Dinner from 5-9:30 pm daily, Sunday 4-9  Located in the Smith shopping center next door to Starbucks. Imagine that!  Early bird dinners feature $1 off food and sushi during the first hour."}
{"text":"Sushi Imagine is an absolute GEM in the Henderson area. The quality of their food exceeds that of nearly all Japanese restaurants I have been to in the valley.  I really appreciate the quality and care that they put into the preparation of their food. The quality of their fish is AWESOME. The texture and flavors of their fish is delectable. And it's very clear that the sushi chef knows what he is doing. The presentation of each piece is beautiful.  They have a good variety of dishes for a customers that may not be into raw fish, but would like some Japanese fare. The kara-age chicken (fried chicken nuggets) that accompanies the bento meals is mouth-wateringly delicious.  And of course on top of the delicious food you get some of the most genuinely friendly service one can get here in Vegas. It is a delight to enjoy a meal here."}
{"text":"It's all about the sauces! Different than your typical sushi place. The special cucumber roll that we had at other places was especially tasty with their pesto, spinach sauce, so good! Screaming O was also delicious, hubs said best he's tasted. Steak with mustard sauce also very good! It was like a mustard/wasabi/ginger something, whatever mustard mix it was, was really good with the steak. Also had the magic carpet which I thought with the kiwi might be too sweet but it wasn't. It was the perfect light appetizer.  The sunset roll also had that pesto sauce and sirracha mix that made it extra tasty!  Kids enjoyed spinning the wheel. We'll be back to cash in on our $5 off and free edamame :)"}
{"text":"Sushi Yeah ... Best food and service!  I have been MIA from Yelp I actually lost 25lbs. I had to break the diet and since i was going to get off the diet ... why not get the all the weight back with SUSHI !!! :)  Give this place a try ... one of the best hidden gems."}
{"text":"Reviews were right on this one! I had some miso soup (amazing), a tiger roll and a rock n roll. Both rolls were awesome and I've never tasted anything like it! I will definitely visit this spot again when I come back!"}
{"text":"We ordered edamame and 4 different rolls. The edamame came out hot and perfectly salted. All 4 rolls were perfect, fish was extremely fresh. All you could ask for in a sushi place not too fancy but great fresh fish"}
{"text":"Come here if you want the following:   1. Yummy sushi 2. Awesomeness service  3. Cleanliness   What else can you ask for?? This place is where you want to be if you want sushi in yo mouth!"}
{"text":"This is a very good sushi place to go to. Has a good price range, very good food for that price, and even a spin wheel, where you can get the chance of getting a free item with a purchase of great enough amount. Come for the lunch specials, they are really good, and demonstrate good quality in the making as well."}
{"text":"Nice little place with a cool Beatles theme. Lots of Beatles stuff, and the music.  The sushi was great, and bits a fun atmosphere for the family.  Beware it's small, but we got right in no problem  Fair prices, and you get to spin the bonus wheel for freebies and coupons too! Great spot"}
{"text":"Seems like a popular place. It's an A-Ok in my book.   Tried it for lunch after a morning of pampering and shopping. They have economical lunch options for anyone in your party (even those that are big sushi fans).  The sushi was fresh, the rolls were good. Service was good.  Nothing spectacular stands out here, but a solid economical lunch option to satiate lunchtime cravings."}
{"text":"If you like sushi and The Beatles, this is the perfect place to eat. The owner is a hard core Beatles fan, so there is memorabilia everywhere. The food is really fresh and the chef is very friendly and excellent cook. My only complaint is that they are closed on Sundays. Otherwise, if you are a sushi freak like me, you will love this place!"}
{"text":"I was in the Green Vally area for lunch and wanted sashimi. I yelped sushi and       Sushi Imagine was the closest and highly rated. This was my first time here.   They don't have a sashimi lunch special(which they should) so my waitress suggested I order the sashimi dinner(16.95) as I wanted salad and rice also.   It was all very good and with generous portions. Service was great and it seems to be a family run business with many regular customers. I was happy and will return."}
{"text":"This review was long overdue but you know it's definitely a great experience when you can't forget your servers name.  When we first walked in were sat down immediately.   The menu had a lot to offer but I do love the specialty different lunch options for each day.  Our server was amazing.  I told her right away I was gluten free and she took control of everything I ordered to make sure it was all gluten free including bringing me GF soy sauce.   When I asked her name she told me its Emory like memory without the M.  Well it stuck in my head for sure.  The food was great I must say.  Every time we have gone back Emory remembers me and has gotten me all my food GF without me even mentioning it.   I will definitely be back.  Thank you again Emory!"}
{"text":"A solid little neighborhood sushi joint. Nothing too fancy pants here, but simple stuff served from the sushi bar and from the kitchen.  Not wanting to limit ourselves to just the fish, we went with a combo that included a salad, some sushi, miso soup, tempura, and chicken karaage. We also added a roll and set forth to eat a modest dinner.  The soup arrived first. A fine bowl of miso. Then the platter with the chicken, sushi and tempura veggies. All were solid. I was a big fan of the chicken but you have to like karaage to enjoy the texture. It was served plenty hot and was definitely juicy. Tempura veggies were a light golden color and still crispy without being overdone. The extra roll came last and was generously portioned and a welcome addition to the mix.  Strip mall sushi spots are some of my faves--because they're so unassuming you can often have your expectations met. Such was the case for me. Simple dinner, then back to the hotel. Easy peasy."}
{"text":"Went here last night. The prices are great and the food is decent. Not my top choice but I would give it another try just because the service was great. I also loved spinning the wheel when I paid my bill.  I won $2 in sushi imagine dollars. Fine little gimmick. It's also super small and quite.  I had a long day at work so this was the right place at the right time for me. The waiters were sweet college kids doing homework on breaks. It's got that family owned vibe and I dig it."}
{"text":"This place is right up the street from us and we haven't been in years. My daughter wanted sushi for her birthday and I was craving their \"school of fish\" (a DELICIOUS basket of fried baby sardines) so off we went. It was just as I remembered, small and cozy. We were a group of 5 but they made room for us right away. We were looking forward to trying the salmon cheek and the \"magic carpet\" but apparently they were out that day. Disappointing, but ah well. The waitress was obviously new and had to leave and double check everything, but I actually prefer that to someone who pretends to know and gets it wrong. And she was so sweet! Food was great and presentation amazing. I have to get here more often."}
{"text":"Went here twice and both times we left happy diners.    Their teriyaki bowl/dinner combo is so cheap and way worth it.  The sushi was fresh, priced well, and the presentation on their sushi items were top notch.    When you finish your meal, you get to spin wheel and can get free things like drinks on next visit, free meals, etc.  Also, the first time we went, it was mother's day.  They took our picture and they placed a cute \"happy mother's day border\" around our photo and gave it to us as a souvenir!   They really enjoy their customers, as they have photos of their diners up on their wall."}
{"text":"So this has to be the best local sushi spot in Henderson. Hands down great sushi and great service.  We went there for a dinner a few nights ago and it was really busy. But the hostess assured us it wouldn't be long and it wasn't. Steady stream of locals and regulars so you know it has to be good.  We had an assortment of sushi. The menu is very traditional but Chef Aki has an assortment of special rolls on his whiteboard next to the sushi counter.  We had the Rock N Roll roll and the Hello Kitty roll, which was my daughters favorite.  Sushi was extremely fresh and some of the best quality I've had here in Vegas and Henderson. You can tell Aki is a big fan of classic rock like the Beatles. Totally cool atmosphere and as I said earlier service was on point.  We didn't have to wait long for everything we ordered. And our drinks were never empty. Like I also said, it was busy but it didn't seem to have an affect on how fast the food came or how attentive everyone was.  I highly recommend this place to any locals here in Henderson or anyone looking for a great sushi spot off the strip!"}
{"text":"An extremely affordable and great Japanese fusion spot in Henderson.  Small and right next to Starbucks, Sushi Imagine is a nice place for dinner and a great lunch option.  They have this cool wheel if you spend $30 to get little coupons for next time.  Food is always good and fast.  Usually have their bento boxes which are great portions and always tasty.  Closed on Sunday's which is a bit of a bummer but open the rest of the time.  Will continue to frequent here!"}
{"text":"I freaking love this place. They're so good, super affordable, and are located within like three miles of two different places I've lived.  The other day in particular (Christmas Eve) I called up because my wife wanted some sushi and we thought we'd get some for her dad who was working all night. We called up and asked about several of the rolls. The girl up front knew exactly what was in pretty much all of the rolls offhand, and when she heard my wife (in the background) mention that she didn't like uncooked fish, she made sure to tell us that they could cook the salmon that was on top of one of the rolls. She also recommended their special (the Obla Di Obla Da Roll) when my wife mentioned what she likes in a roll and it was an amazing recommendation.  This wasn't my first visit, it won't be my last, and I would absolutely recommend it to anyone."}
{"text":"I'm obsessed with this place!  The sweetest team operates this restaurant.  It's small with odd, mis-match decor, but I'm not here to eat the decor.  The uni is the best!  Fresh, fresh, fresh!    I'm a fan of futomaki, and I have only seen it in a few other restaurants from Mississippi, New Orleans, and Memphis (I'm originally a southern girl).  When I saw futomaki on the menu, it was a definite must to order!  The seaweed was crispy and fresh; best for cone-shaped hand rolls or makis!  Soda is only $0.95!!! Is this 1998?!?! I haven't seen refillable coke be so cheap!   I usually sit at the sushi bar, service is always fast and attentive.  Love this place!  #SupportLocalBusinesses!"}
{"text":"I'm Japanese, but I can't understand how the heck everyone can eat  at a AYCE sushi joint, and not become a diabetic.  lol.    Okay,  I understand you can't do it on a daily basis, but how's about checking out a Sushi joint that actually owned by a Japanese person, and has a Japanese sushi chef.     I came by this place by chance a few weeks ago, because I had to get a Pizza at  Papa John for my nephews, and this place located next door to them.    It's a small restaurant, and it was closed at that time because they take a short break between lunch and dinner; so I  put it on the back burner, and planned to come back.  Well, a few weeks later I finally checked them out.   There not much seats in this restaurant, and when I got there it was getting near closing time for them; so I got in without waiting.  I'm not much of sashimi person, so I ordered a Inari sushi  (3.00) for my appetizer, and I have to admit, it was very good.   Not too overpowering on the vinegar.    For my dinner, I ordered a Chicken teriyaki, Tempura, and Kara-age.   The teri Chicken was good, but the Kara-age was ono!      Wow....close to even my mom's recipe.      Service was fast,  maybe because I was the last person in for the night, but for under 20.00 with a tip, I was very surprised to have very good Japanese meal in Henderson.       It's not AYCE sushi, but who the heck can really eat that much rice without having a glucose tolerances issue.      This place is worth the drive."}
{"text":"Great Small Neighborhood Sushi Restaurant  * Awesome Service 5 stars The folks here are so nice...genuine....attentive without being annoying The sushi chef is the master juggler... he does it all.... covers the counter and all the table orders... and he's 'on top of it all'  * Lunch specials...starts at $6  *Combo plates... didn't try them but they looked great... for $13  * Fish specialities like Salmon Cheek...  Salmon Cheek was so flavorful and different... not your ordinary fish offerings at a sushi place... that's what makes this place special... their 'Special Fish' board  * The 'Wheel 'o Money'... for every $30 you get to spin the wheel for a chance to win Sushi Imagine Bucks to use on your next visit.  * It's small... about 7 or 8 stools at the counter. Plus 8 fourtops. So, big parties... note that it might be hard to get a table to fit y'all  * The regular fish offerings are nothing out of the ordinary.  I'd only give them 3 stars based on the regular selections... the yellowtail, salmon and tuna were not the best that I've ever tasted but it was good  *  Price...not super expensive... not super cheap.... the rolls range from $9-12...  *The rolls were well crafted and not overly sauced so I'm on board...and the sushi chef asks you how spicy you want the sauce... that's awesome!  * The Ginger was not my favorite... it had too much of a 'bite' to it... I like my ginger sweet, crisp and refreshing"}
{"text":"Not good.   All I had was a few rolls but it was pretty bland and dry.    Don't think I'll be going back.    I'll stick with I love sushi"}
{"text":"So good! Stopped in with my family tonight. The location isn't anything impressive, but don't let that deter you. We had seaweed salad, cucumber salad, edamame, grilled squid, and a couple of rolls. Everything tasted fresh and was delicious."}
{"text":"Amazing Sushi the people are so nice and politely greet you . This is the best sushi place I ate at in Vegas well Henderson ."}
{"text":"Love this little gem. Family is very nice and welcoming, they are opening back up end of June but just for dinner service. No more lunch service"}
{"text":"I've been a regular here for years, and every time I've left with a genuine sense of joy and contempt. This is not AYCE, but instead a journey of the palate interpreted through the story of the Beatles (the restaurant's namesake). Specialty rolls like Yellow Submarine, In My Life and P.S. I Love You are odes to top Beatles hits that include common sushi components enhanced by the craft of Chef Aki, who creates stunning art both on the roll itself and around the plate (see Sunrise Roll in the photo album) as his wife and family round out the remaining staff.  This is a family-owned business in every sense of the word. Customers pay homage to their amazing customer service and hospitality by providing various Beatle memorabilia, which is seen throughout the walls of the establishment. The memorabilia is only outmatched by the hundreds of photos of patrons lucky enough to win the grand prize from spinning the wheel. Yes, a chance to spin a wheel for every $30 you spend, and a photo of you with the $20 voucher (myself, the proud owner of two such photographs).  This is a great lunch spot, with traditional reduced price items, and generally good dinner specials as well, myself a fan of the Large Beer + free sake. The liquor selection isn't anything to write home about, if only because Many are too busy admiring the quality of the fish Aki uses.  I'd be remiss if I didn't mention the nigiri given the love shown for Aki's specialty rolls. Cuts of fish are generally thick, the fish/rice ratio (scientific term) is incredible for nigiri lovers, which I actually prefer to specialty rolls in general. Look for fish specials written in the white boards on the wall, or ask Aki yourself. The man has an amazing memory and can make you whatever you want, or anything you've had elsewhere, if he has everything he needs.   If you are tired of the quantity of good sushi you've consumed in Las Vegas' many good AYCE spots, try the quality of amazing sushi at Sushi Imagine. If, \"All You Need is Love\" you can't go wrong with this place. I promise."}
{"text":"Amazing!! Great small family owned restaurant.  We ordered gyoza, sashimi appetizer,  tempura udon, rattlesnake roll, hurricane ahi roll, and firecracker roll.   The fish was so fresh! Absolutely delicious."}
{"text":"Recommend for anyone that want great sushi with great atmosphere. What more can you ask for in a restaurant? I really couldn't ask for more. I really can't believe anyone giving this place lower than five stars. I guess that's just more great sushi and great service for me! Will be going back again really soon."}
{"text":"I guess they have a following, but it's not that good. I had lunch here years ago and now gave it another try... The rolls were just average to below average and overall nothing special at all. The royal spicy tuna roll had such little tuna in it that it seemed nearly missing of any tuna at all. Fish on the nigiri is not that fresh and unagi was mushy and boring, we've had better. Screaming O, was off flavor, mushy tuna that should be seared should it not? Even the wasabi was dull and dry.  Yeah, sushi imagine, not reality."}
{"text":"What an unexpected surprise!! Was in the area and stumbled across the shopping center that Sushi Imagine is located in. Decided to give it a try and so glad we did! They offer Great Lunch $5 Specials: -Monday- Chicken Teriyaki+Tempura  -Tuesday is grilled mackerel & Kara-age -Weds- Fried Aji + Kara-age -Thurs- Chicken & Dalmon Teriyaki -Friday- Chicken Curry Rice All served with soup, salad and side of rice  Miso soup is tasty and flavorful & side salad is fresh with the ideal Japanese dressing, just enough and not overly saucy.  Chicken Kara-age is bomb!! Tastes close to my mom's homemade fried chicken, which is the best fried chicken I've ever had, my date agreed. A couple pieces were a little fatty for my liking but otherwise super juicy, crispy on the outside & flavorful!  Spicy tuna had good kick, fresh flavor and the rice is just perfect, which lately we've been missing in our sushi endeavors.   Chardonnay served super chilled and refreshing on this hot day was a nice little bonus at $3.95. Our service was friendly & fast with the refills ongoing!   Add in a white board of daily fresh offerings, some great classic rock tunes and a wheel of fortune (spend $30 & get a spin to win cash or prizes) for a totally quirky, fresh & delicious sushi experience from a great small business! Wish they were on our side of town so we could make it a frequent rotation; I'd be here all the time!!"}
{"text":"Their raw fish tasted super fresh, and was great. This place serves actual, good, authentic sushi that is made with love. No thin, obviously frozen old fish here. Delicious! I'll definitely be back next time I visit vegas."}
{"text":"Make no mistake about it, this place is wonderful. It's great on so many levels...a casual sushi place in a fun, guilt free environment at guilt free prices, served by friendly , smiling people. I can't believe I didn't try this place out earlier, because this is now my favorite sushi spot in Henderson. You don't HAVE to dress up and go to the strip for reliably good sushi-- this place is a gem in the middle of suburbia.  We had some tampura vegetables as an appetizer. Good stuff.  My girlfriend had the shrimp tampura roll. Pretty standard stuff, but this one was delectably sweet and had some tasty sprouts around it, giving it an extra satisfying crunch.  It wasn't the largest meal but I wasn't super hungry so i ordered only two items. I had the spicy tuna roll and their specialty aloha ahi tuna delight... or some name like that I don't recall exactly. The spicy tuna was excellent, the best I've had in years. The rice comprising the rolls was not dry or old tasting and the meat was just perfect.   The ahi tuna roll was even more amazing. Each piece had a succulent slice of ahi tuna over it and man...the spiciness was right at my level. Every last bite was blissful-- I can't say enough wonderful things about this establishment. I would have ordered more rolls but my girlfriend wouldn't let me.   I can't wait to come back and try more items on the menu. If you need good sushi for a small group in an intimate setting, you can find no better option than this place. I recommend you try it out."}
{"text":"I have been eating here for years.  Aki and his family are Henderson's best kept secret.  I have never had a bad meal here. The lunch specials are really affordable and filling.  The specialty rolls are all unique and I have worked my way down the list over the years. Hard to choose a favorite.  Great Vibe and always good music and conversation."}
{"text":"Killer place, went in to get some takeout soup and a little sushi because I've been sick, told the lady I wanted something with veggies and miso soup. Made me a delicious soup and even wrote feel better soon on the soup :)   It's the little things, this place is great! Definately get the soup, I'm pretty sure it's made with love :)"}
{"text":"My bf wanted to have sushi tonight and my task was to chose a sushi joint near home.  After I yelped, Sushi Imagine was the highest rated and closest in proximity.  When we arrived, we were immediately welcomed by all servers and chefs.  They are super friendly.    We ordered the following: -Bento Box #3: includes tempura (light and crispy), sashimi (doesn't taste so fresh and the tuna does not taste like sashimi grade), rice, chicken kare-age (very tasty), small salad and miso soup.   -Spider Roll: very beautifully plated.  Too bad it doesn't taste as great as it looks.  -Spicy tuna roll topped with a white fish: never again will we order this.  The spicy tuna over powers all the other flavors, assuming that there are other flavors.  -Order of hamachi sushi:  Not the best piece of fish...  Before you leave, your table gets one spin on the wheel of paper money so that you can redeem on the next visit.  My bf spinned the wheel and we got $2 worth of paper money.  Almost forgot, from 5pm - 6pm, you get a dollar off an entree, buy a large beer and you get a free small sake.  They also have a daily lunch menu of $5/lunch special.  I may come back for the lunch special since grilled mackerel over rice and chicken kara-age sounds like a steal.  Overall, food wasn't delicious as I have hoped, but the service was awesome."}
{"text":"The place is okay. It's small so i would think the service would be fast but there were many things I had to repeat here and there. The nigiris weren't the best either. I've had much better! Usually salmon nigiri is an easy go-to but I couldn't eat theirs. The rolls were just okay as well. The only thing I really liked was their steak teriyaki bowl!"}
{"text":"Went back for dinner this week.  Tempura, sushi combination was very tasty as well as filling.  Great food and value for any restaurant."}
{"text":"I really wanted sushi while visiting Las Vegas last weekend for the spring break event. We were headed to the Green Valley Resort and I thought we would just have sushi there. Then my boyfriend who always finds the best places to eat while I complain about going to them said he found a sushi spot he wanted to check out. So this was definitely off the beaten Vegas path but well worth the short 15 minute drive.   Located in a cute little shopping center, we were greeted warmly by the host and decided to sit at a table instead of the bar. We ordered saki which was delicious and sweet. Next we settled on three cut rolls and then some unagi, salmon and yellow tail. The spicy tuna roll was tasty but I really liked the Mr. Roboto roll the best. It was loaded with tempura shrimp and freshly sliced avocado. I do not remember the name of the third roll, we were in a sushi coma by that time I am sure.  The bill was fairly low, I guess I am used to L.A. priced sushi. We also got to spin their little wheel of fortune game and I won an order of edamame on our next visit....and since we are going back in July I plan on using my cute little coupon then.  Great service and very tasty sushi. Worth stopping by."}
{"text":"Imagine a place where you get to spin a big fun wheel with dollar bills all over it and hear that authentic ticking sound of possibility. Imagine a sushi chef who remembers your name and knows some Hawaiian. Imagine spicy tuna hand rolls that are the right size rather than superfat. Imagine The Beatles on blast for hours.   So I may be a little starstruck because I won $20 this past week on the sushi spin wheel, but i really like Sushi Imagine. I have taken advantage of the $1 off all food items by arriving between 5 and 6 pm but kind of felt like I was robbing a loved one. Though I would do it again in a heartbeat.  This is truly a fun place to be and yet another unexpected way to experience community in Vegas.  Salmon nigiri and spicy tuna hand rolls are the best. I order two of each."}
{"text":"Based on the reviews, we went to this Sushi place last night. The sushi chef was nice, the service was good but the sushi was awful. The tuna was dry and tasted old. We had a tempura roll that was under cooked and soggy. The tuna on top of the rock n roll was very dried out. Wouldn't recommend it and wouldn't go there again."}
{"text":"I go here about once every two weeks. They consistently have great quality sushi at a good price.  I love the rainbow roll and the hello kitty roll.  I also get their lunch special of 4 pieces of spicy tuna roll, 3 pieces of sushi (tuna, salmon, and shrimp) plus soup.  All for $5.95.  Perfect for lunch.  They are always friendly, and if you spend over a certain $$ (30?) you can spin the wheel. I won $20 coupon once!!"}
{"text":"A wonderful little hideaway where you spin a wheel (ala Price is Right) for free coupons off your next visit.  Their Nigiri is off the hook. Tuna is so wonderful, flavorful and thickly cut. My only knock might be the rice. It is too soft and falls apart when I dip it in my soy sauce. This is really a small problem, considering how great the fish is. The staff is wonderful and where else can I eat ebi while listening to The Beatles?"}
{"text":"I came here tonight with my two daughters for dinner. I had never seen this place show up on yelp before and was excited by all the five star reviews. I decided to drive the 15 minutes away to check it out. I immediately did not like the looks of it. It has as much ambiance as a gas station. We were already there and hungry so I figured we would give it a shot. I should have trusted my instinct. When your 5 and 10 year olds can't stand the look or taste of the food you know you have a problem. I ordered the sashimi dinner, and three rolls. The rice on the rolls was hot! The quality of the fish is that of an AYCE place, I avoid these like the plague. I prefer quality or quantity. The menu is limited. The only thing that was edible was the miso soup and edamame. The servers were really sweet and friendly, but they were really slow. I repeatedly had to ask for a napkin, wasabi or a plate. I would not return even if someone was buying. Seeing all these high reviews from other posters is taking away my faith in using Yelp as a reliable resource. When in Henderson head straight to I Love Sushi or better yet hit the strip and go to Hyakumi. They give you hot towels, cucumber salads and edamame for free."}
{"text":"Really lucky to have a quality sushi spot in a rather unassuming location - in a strip mall near a Starbucks and a Papa John's. But the sushi quality is very good here, hot food is excellent (love having a place to take care of my oyakadon fix!), the service is friendly, and it's very high on value proposition.  Pro tip: Even if you're aiming for value, feel free to order off the dinner menu at lunch (just ask for the dinner menu if you need it) - they'll give you a lunch discount."}
{"text":"So tried this place because of yelp reviews. I was in the mood for good sushi but in a quiet environment. This delivered both. Small store with warm welcoming and attentive wait staff. A little strange that most of the roll menu was written on a wipe board so you have to get up and walk over to read it from your table. One chef making the sushi, so it takes a few minutes to get the order. But sushi is presented very nicely and is very tasty. I will be back!"}
{"text":"Very good rolls, good service. The lack of fresh wasabi and one of the sushi chefs sneezed and only rinsed his hands in water NO SOAP eeewwww a deal breaker!"}
{"text":"Came here by Chance while waiting to get my hair done. The food was really yummy and well presented and the service was perfect. The prices were also more then fair. Id definitely come here again!"}
{"text":"Giving this place 4 stars. When I walked in, I was a little deterred by the wat it looked inside, very small. But We sat down. The waitress was very nice. She helped us with the menu since not all of the items on the menu had a description.  We ordered the creamy mermaid, jalepeno bomb, volcano roll sunset roll and rock n roll. The food tasted fresh and came out quickly. I would not order the creamy mermaid again or the rock n roll but everything was pleasant And I had a good time. They even had a wheel to spin for a prize on your next visit. Would recommend and return."}
{"text":"Came in on a Sat night hoping they had all you can eat...they dont! Prices were good, sushi was okay. Nothing really stood out to me in my opinion. Place was packed so we sat at the bar. Small lil place"}
{"text":"Really good sushi here, both traditional sushi and modern sushi rolls. The service was also a big plus. Our waitress was not robotic or pushy, she was able to realize we were full and did not continue offering us more food or desert.  Then at the end of our meal we got to spin the wheel!"}
{"text":"This place has great deals on their menu, especially for lunch. They have a $5 bento box that changes with the day and also have $1 all sushi.  I was seated quickly, but after I ordered it took about 15min for my bento box to come out, then after I finished my bento box I waited another 15min for my sushi to come out. They might have been understaffed?  I had uni(sea urchin), ebi(shrimp), white tuna, salmon. The seafood was pretty good, but the rice was not. It was the same texture and taste as the rice I received in my bento box. Due to being the same, the rice was falling apart in my sushi."}
{"text":"Upon arrival we were sat down quickly. The server had a nice big smile and we felt very welcomed to eat at this sushi place. We went during the early bird special and honestly this was my first time here. I just googled \"sushi places near me\" and this came up with a 4.7 review on google reviews.   The server came up right away and let us choose where to sit and asked us what we would like to drink. She gave us menus and told us about their lunch special.   Since we went on a Thursday, they had a chicken teriyaki and salmon teriyaki plate for $5. It comes with salad, rice, and miso soup with grilled salmon and chicken teriyaki. That's a stellar deal! They also have this \"early bird special\" of $1 off the sushi list when you done in from 1130am-230pm. They give you a paper list and you just check off what you want and the quantity. They also have this wheel that you spin when you spend $30 or more and they give you like coupons that you can use the next time you eat there.   I got the dragon roll and my Mom got the crunchy roll. It was fresh and it tasted good. I'll probably go back again when I'm within the area. Keep up the great job on serving fresh sushi!"}
{"text":"Hands down the best kept secret in Henderson. The dinner special has awesome deals. Extremely pleased with this place."}
{"text":"Unfortunately, and very suddenly, Sushi Imagine has closed their doors. We had been coming here since the spring of 2012 and was our 'go to' place for Sushi and other Japanese dishes. We'll miss the charm of a true family run Sushi-ya, spinning the prize wheel (2x $20 winner), and rushing there early enough to take advantage of happy hour.  Gochisousama deshita"}
{"text":"Aki, you and your darling wife, rock...my husband is worried I terrified you - but we're confident you could tell from our enthusiastic consumption of your delicously decadent dishes that we were more than delighted...  ecstatic.   and you're in our neighborhood.  ok - you're secret menu rocks - but it is decidedly for only the very very well informed... but I loved that you shared dishes from it with us - they were yummy.    but I loved the uni fried in oba the best -   the special rolls you made were fabulous - and I get they were time consuming - but we didn't begin to crack the surface of your skills...that's evident - but we did get full.   so thank you -thank you for tolerating us -and welcoming us on a quiet Saturday night (people, seriously, you need to fix that - cause this is brilliant wonderful Japanese deliciousness!) and didn't send us away, tails between our legs!    Bless you -- your business - and all your guests that realize how lucky we are to have you in our neighborhood -- now please stay!   xoxo  tori & eric  : )"}
{"text":"I think I've just found my new favorite lunch special.  My friend has been urging me to try Sushi Imagine for a while now, and I finally agreed to eat lunch there with him today. Easily accessible in suburban Henderson just off the Valle Verde exit of 215, this small sushi restaurant is in the corner of the Smith's plaza about as far away as you can get from that grocery store.  There is a $5.00 dine-in only weekday lunch special that's different on each day. It's only available between 11:30am and 2:30pm. Tuesday's is grilled saba (mackerel) and kara-age. This particular one feels like such a steal, although the pictures of the others don't look too shabby either. They start you with a good miso soup that isn't too salty or watery, and then they bring out the bento box with rice, salad, a mushroom/seaweed mix, a couple small slices of orange, and the aforementioned proteins.  It is astonishing how much protein I got. The mackerel is a large chunk of moist, flaky fish that can go for around that price on its own at other places. The kara-age comes as five bite-sized chunks of juicy, flavorful chicken that can be dressed with the lime wedge. The rice is a balanced portion if you eat it with both proteins, and the veggies and fruits are fresh and tasty.  I will be back for Sushi Imagine's lunch specials sooner than later. I'm a little sad that I'm always busy on Fridays now because I probably won't be able to try the chicken curry for a while, but I'm sure the other specials will be as good if not better."}
{"text":"Went there today for my first time, what a great little place to enjoy some good sushi. The waitress and sushi makers were extremely nice and the sushi wasn't even expensive. Was very delicious:) will be going back there for my sushi!"}
{"text":"Service was EXCELLENT! Everyone is so nice, even the sushi chef greets you when you enter and thanks you when you leave. Sushi was great quality. I love the wheel you get to spin for coupons when you leave! The family right before us won a $20 coupon!"}
{"text":"I love sushi.. I'm not a sushi snob but I know good sushi and this restaurant really know their sushi!! Did I say enough \"sushi\"? Lol I loved their food and staff were very friendly. I took away a star because of the cleanliness of the restaurant. I think they need to work on that."}
{"text":"Hands down best sushi place in Henderson...maybe in Las Vegas. All their rolls are good. And their sauces are even better."}
{"text":"Small sushi restaurant located in a strip mall.  Cafe style sushi restaurants seem to be a thing here in suburban Las Vegas. The dining area is small with limited seating at the sushi bar. The waitstaff was very friendly.  I had the Hurricane Ahi roll which was delicious. The menu has several specialty rolls and I will definitely be back to try more.  Tip: spin the wheel in your way out and get a prize."}
{"text":"Wow!  My new favorite sushi place is a mile from my house.  Their beer is cold and their fish are fresh.  Mondays is 20% off already reasonable sushi prices for ladies.  I went for the first time about 2 months ago and I have been back 5 times since then.  Be prepared for the entire extremely friendly staff to say hello when you walk in the door."}
{"text":"It's a tiny little hole in the wall but quite tasty. Everything was great--Hawaiian poke was probably my least favorite but still yummy. There were three of us and we had 4 rolls--a couple salads and some miso soup. I would definitely return for another dinner."}
{"text":"We LOVE, love, love (enough loves?), love! this place.  We were recommended to come here by the people at Shabu Shabu Paradise and it was the best thing (food-wise) we have ever done.  =]  We are now regulars there as the owners are awesome (family run), sushi is perfect, and the atmosphere is nice as it is more laid back.  Our favorites are:  hurricane ahi, Mr. Roboto, Hello Kitty, Cuke roll, Rock n Roll, Crunchy Roll, etc. etc.  lol  They also have delicious teriyaki, noodles, and other items if you have kids or people who are not sushi fans.  Aki (the owner) used to have a huge sushi restaraunt in California before moving here.  So he has the talent to back it up here in Henderson.  The place is small, but we like that about this place.  They also always have specials and if you spend $30 or more you can spin the \"wheel\" to win Sushi IMAGINE bucks or other free stuff for your next visit.  Go there!  =D"}
{"text":"Yes, yes, and more yes!  I happened upon Sushi Imagine while reading Yelp reviews and the place had amazing reviews so I decided I just had to try it the next time I was out in Henderson. Typically my trips to Henderson involve a visit to The District, which is what I was doing today. Luckily Sushi Imagine is just a hop on the 2-15 from the shopping center, or just a street or two away.   At first I couldn't find it because my GPS was not being nice to me, but then I realized it was behind the McDonalds! If you get into the shopping center and can't find it... just look behind the fast food. ;)  The lunch specials, oh the lunch specials! Lunch specials for $5! And a big cup of soda for 95 cents! I opted though for the $7.95 lunch special - spicy tuna and california roll plus miso soup! Sure, they're kinda boring rolls, but for that price I couldn't pass them up! There are also other lunch specials where you can get a spicy tuna roll plus three nigiri!  Service was excellent and the sushi chef greets you as you enter! I absolutely adore this little sushi place (and yes, it is little) and I will be back for sure when I am in the Henderson area."}
{"text":"The family that owns and works at this place were very professional and kind. I ate almost everything you could think of there and it was all wonderful including a custom order they accommodated. 10 out of 10 would go again!"}
{"text":"I feel like all I've been leaving lately is 5's, and that I'm being soft, and not critical enough. But thanks to Yelp, I always seem to find gems recommended by the amazing reviews from fellow Yelpers, like this one... Sushi Imagine is the ISH!! So be it, 5's all day for this one too.   I really don't even want to elaborate, because I could write about them all night, but Chef Aki deserved a high accolade for the precision with which he runs his establishment. Fresher than fresh fish, imaginative menu, and wonderful family vibe, I feel like the sushi at this place was made just for us with incredible love and care. Returning to Sushi Imagine is my favorite time in life!!   Spin the wheel, and come back all the time!!"}
{"text":"I have visiting family in from Nebraska who was craving sushi. As this is Las Vegas and you can find almost anything here I pulled up the Yelp app on my phone, did some checking and I find Sushi Imagine. Coolies, it's located right off I-215 and Valle Verde so it's easy to get to. Why not. But I have to bring my 2 year old along so this complicates things a bit as he's picky. So we go and they are not open till 11:30. Ok, we go do something else for 30 min and come back and they're open. From the outside it looks like it's just another place in a strip mall. Step inside and you'll forget all about that.   You have two places to sit, right in front of the sushi bar, or at one of about 6 tables in the place. Service: Expectations totally exceeded. WOW! From the minute our wait person came over to our table until we left, she brought her A game. We had MANY questions and she answered them all. Kids plates, a sippy cup to contain any drink mess, and smiles all the way through. They didn't have a \"kids menu\" but she recommended several things and we went with Udon noodles. Smart choice. Once they cooled off he practically inhaled them, and was smiling. If he's happy, I'm happy. But it got better.   I ordered a lunch special with miso soup, Fried Aji & Kara-Age. Oh wow. I couldn't finish it all, not that I didn't try. There was nothing on that plate from the salad on down that I didn't enjoy. But the real treat was the sushi rolls. We ended up ordering a Rainbow Roll and a Dragon Roll. While the way they were presented at the table was nice, the ear to ear smile that my family member had was all that I needed to see. But a quick bite left me wanting more! Good stuff!  When it was time to go our server helped with bagging our food, and we got to spin a wheel on the way out where I won 2 $1 off coupons for my next visit. And I can assure you there will be a next visit. I really like this place. When I can't make it over to Kyara this will do just fine for my Japanese fix.  Edit: I'm revising my ratings a little bit. I don't want to give 5 stars out so much so this is where I'm starting to change my reviews up. Just because it's only 4 stars doesn't mean I wasn't smiling from ear to ear with a bounce in my step when I walked out the door."}
{"text":"Finally an affordable sushi restaurant with high quality fish. I can be quite picky with my sushi but was very impressed with the quality of the sushi.  The sweet shrimp and scallop were both exceptional. Not the biggest roll fan but the rock n roll was very good.  This place has some great sushi platter deals and the lunch specials are very good.  Would recommend checking this place out."}
{"text":"2.5 stars.  Went here the other day for lunch.  Cute little dive sushi restaurant in the Smith's shopping center on the corner of valle verde and paseo verde. Service was good and they offered a variety of lunch specials. I ordered one of the nigiri lunches.   He ordered a salmon bento that came with fried chicken. We also ordered a rock n roll. The rock n roll was probably my favorite thing.   The fish quality was not the best.  The fish itself on the nigiri was kinda sad looking and flavorless.   The fried chicken in my hubby's lunch was rubbery and not crunchy at all as if it had been fried hours ago.   I probably wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"Love their lunch specials! Especially the curry!"}
{"text":"I might be jumping the gun here since it was my first time but there are a couple of reasons. First I ordered take out so the fact I ate it all and it was all delicious is impressive. Secondly don't judge this book by its cover because at first I almost didn't go, it's so small I think they might only be able to fit 20 people. Thirdly everyone is authentically Japanese and I am from Tokyo so I appreciate the portions, quality and touch. All and I mean each such I roll was fresh and wasn't questionable. California rolls are usually blah to me but these were interestingly delicious and I want to go back to get a full roll LOL. The only thing is maybe they forgot to give me a side of rice with my chicken teriyaki or maybe it doesn't come with it not sure. But I didn't really miss it because it was all yummy! Definitely going back"}
{"text":"Amazing sushi! My favorite menu items are  magic carpet, spider roll and tiger roll.   Great customer service too!"}
{"text":"Nice, friendly, quick, reasonable, good food! Thanks!!"}
{"text":"Not the very best sushi I've ever had but decent. The location is small and they have a quirky and cute Beatles theme happening inside (John Lennon on the wall, Beatles music playing, rolls named after Beatles songs- you get the idea). Very reasonable prices and good sized portions. Among our group we got a Spicy Tuna, a Hurricane- Ahi roll, a Lasagna roll, and the Hello Kitty roll as well as an appetizer of gyoza. So let's break it down:  Gyoza: very good, had a bit of crunch to it Spicy Tuna: average, small roll with 8 pieces, mildly spicy. Not bad but not my favorite either. Hurricane- Ahi: good, recommended by our waitress this was a solid choice, tasty sauces. Japanese Lasagna: not for me, too unsushi-like, baked with cream cheese and a sweet sauce Hello Kitty: good, big roll with 8 pieces, sauce and tempura. I would probably order again.  At the end of the meal you can \"spin the wheel\" and get coupons for $1-20 off your next visit or free appetizers and drinks."}
{"text":"When I first walked in I noticed how small the place was!! And I knew it was going to be amazing little mom and pop shops are always amazing!! So i sit down and right away I was greeted by a extremely nice server!!! I ordered a huge bento box for 5$ a California roll for 2$ an oninigiri for 2$ and washed it all down with a 95cent soda!! Everything was fast, tasty and fresh!! Fantastic!!!! I will be going back for sure!!!"}
{"text":"First time in here and we ordered the rock n roll philly, hello Kitty (amazing), playboy (next time I am getting it Spicer!), and the lover boy. The server was very friendly and the gentleman at the sushi bar was extremely nice! We eat sushi all the time and like trying new places. And glad we decided to check this place out. Will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Very Authentic!!!  I really enjoy Japanese food, and I must say that this one is rather authentic.  From the Japanese Sushi Chef to the lady helping, this is not a big business hiring a bunch of people to say \"welcome\" in Japanese, but the real deal.  The difference in the real deal compared to so many other places is that it is simple, not overpowering and you get the real flavors, not a bunch of flavors that are indistinguishable.  Appetizers - Had the Edamame, Kara-Age and the Gyoza, Simple salted Edamame that was very firm and easy to shell. The gyoza was very nice, not soggy or with sauce on it. You have to dip it in sauce if you want it. Chicken Kara-age is very simple, almost fried pieces of chicken. Yet, it is easy to be oily, or simply breaded. This one was very tender and the crispy batter was very light.  Main Dish -   California Rolls - Very nice.  Chicken Teriyaki - My daughter did not seem to like it so much as it had a lot of sauce, but I found the chicken to be very tender.  Combo 1- Chicken Teriyaki,Tempura,Kara-age - Son had this and it was ALL gone. Lots of food, had left overs.  Salmon Teriyaki - Perfect fish and the skin was crispy. I like it this way.  Sushi Combo 6 - Sushi,Sashimi,Kara-age - Love the simplicity of this dish.  Desserts - Did not try any.  Service - Very nice, pleasant. Very accommodating.  Prices - I did not see all you can eat, each sushi roll is about 12-13.00 and the set meals are all about 10-16.00.  Parking - Strip mall, very easy.  Seating - This place is small. So either come at off hours, or be prepared to wait!  GK says, check it out!"}
{"text":"I'm not a 'Sushi' sushi eater.  Which means I just eat the Rolls.  Spicy Tuna, California, etc.  I think I'm honest enough to admit that isn't really Sushi.  At least, I don't think it is.  I won't pretend I know anything about Sushi but I will say I liked this place.  I thought it was fairly cheap, delicious, and cozy.  A nice neighborhood joint that didn't have AYCE which seems a bit gross when it's fish and what not.    The chefs (what do you call them?) had head bands (what do you call them?) on and they yelled (nice things) at me when I walked in the door, so that was nice.  They have happy hour on beer and it looked like some great lunch specials."}
{"text":"my fiance and I just moved here from Orange County and not to sound like a snob but we are keen on top notch sushi. I have been to a few places in Vegas and am not big on the sushi I have experienced. Most places are all you can eat and give lots of rice and charge extra if you don't finish every grain!  Sushi Imagine has fresh cuts of fish, they do not over do the rice, great service, and reasonably priced.  Two people two large beers and free saki total was 75 bucks before tip! That is reasonable in my book.  I would def recommend the salmon, the mermaid appetizer, and do not forget to check the board for specialty rolls. I am a picky sushi eater and have already been back here several times since my first visit!"}
{"text":"Hello kitty roll is really good here. I saw the reviews and coming from la where sushi restaurants are a dime a dozen. It's pretty good. I also had tonkatsu and it wasn't dry on the center. The chicken teriyaki is good not the best but pretty decent. I want to try the tempura ice cream. The service is really good she kept checking on me I haven't asked for Anything ye but there is only one other group here right now. They also have early bird that is a $1.00 off sushi."}
{"text":"My fiancé and I visited Sushi Imagine a few weeks ago.  It took me this long to mull over what rating to give this place.  It gets five stars by default.  Let me explain.  I guess I am a neanderthal, but I have never eaten sushi before.  Yup, it's true.  I was raised in the Midwest.  My family eats burgers and hot dogs and drinks sweet tea.  There isn't a sushi restaurant for several hours in any direction.  (Did I mention I didn't drive on a paved road until I was 18?  It's true.)  So, you must understand, trying sushi was a REEEAAALLL stretch for me.  In the interest of being culturally proficient, I solicited opinions about what to order from all my (more cosmopolitan) friends on Facebook.  List of suggestions in hand and fear in our heart, we walked into Sushi Imagine hoping to discover a new love.  Oh my sweet, sweet lord.  This did NOT go as well as planned.  I think we just don't like sushi.  In fact, we made total jerks of ourselves because we don't know how to use chopsticks.  I won't lie, we just went at our plates with our hands.  We tried the California roll, spider roll, and inari.  I will say, the inari was delicious.  It came out first and gave us a lot of hope that we might like the other things we ordered.  It was not to be.  We were wasabi-dunking fools - who knew that stuff was so darn spicy?  Not I!  I walked out with the clearest sinuses I have had in years.  And the sushi?  I don't get it.  I really don't.  I wanted to like it, oh yes, I did.  I guess I'm just a simple country bumpkin after all.  I gave this place five stars because the service was excellent, the presentation was gorgeous, and they were pretty gracious about us leaving out plates behind almost full, laughing as we paid and left.  I'm sure we were a sight to behold.  If you want good sushi, I'm sure this is the place.  I might go back and just order about ten orders of inari.  If you see a curly-haired woman with a plate full of inari, it's probably me.  Come say hello."}
{"text":"The best sushi in Henderson,  hands down.  This restaurant is a family business.  Sushi is served at the perfect temperature.   Order a large beer and one saki is free.  Lunch specials are great value.  Spend $30. And spin the wheel for discount coupons on next visit."}
{"text":"I had the chicken teriyaki + tempura combo and a ca roll for 11 on a monday afternoon.  - cheap deal! 5 bucks for the combo! 3 for the roll! 1 for a soda! - small combo portion. few pieces of chicken. 4 pieces of tempura (1 shrimp), tiny bit of mac salad, salad, rice and couple oranges. - good music! they were playing utada hikaru :) - fast and friendly service.  - nothing special with taste, but expected for what i got.  - good lunch in between work."}
{"text":"Small family-owned sushi bar with great vibe, great food, great sake, great Beatles memorabilia and music playing...yes that's correct. Beatles music and memorabilia. Very relaxing place. Staff knew most customers by first names. Very casual. And friendly prices to go with the excellent food. Who needs the glitz, hype and high prices of some sushi palaces that feel more like a dance club than a dining experience....this place is like the friendly neighborhood tavern."}
{"text":"Hubby and I tried to eat here but it smelled like they had a plumbing issue so we left."}
{"text":"A solid lunch option for me because they have sushi combos and no AYCE. No AYCE means I'm not stuffed when I go back to work, but it also can be trouble for me because my lack of discipline can lead to a $40-$50 lunch. It's hard to say no when I'm eating good sushi.   I order the lunch special #3 ($7.95) which consists of miso soup, 5 pieces of nigiri, and 4 pieces of california roll. That usually isn't enough for me so I'll order a roll or two more. Keep an eye on the dry erase board which has some additional delicious items not offered on the menu. The writing is small, so you might have to get up to look. On this visit I also ordered the A Little Help from My Friend (~$12?): cucumber, cream cheese, crab, topped with seared NY strip and mustard sauce. The roll was delicious. There is also donburi and udon selections on the lunch menu.  The chefs and the server are always on top of things and I'm never stressed about getting to back to work on time. This place will always be on the radar when looking for lunch options."}
{"text":"Great sushi and affordable for 4. Fresh fish and the yellowtail cheek was perfect.  Great service and highly recommended."}
{"text":"I really really really really like this place.  It is tiny - 4 tables and 8 sushi bar spots.    The Sushi chef is Japanese.  It seems to be a family run place.  Excellent service - a convivial establishment.  They had a buy a Saporo and get a free sake deal - you can't argue with that!  We had monkey brain appetizer, firecracker roll, spicey tuna and a tiger eye.  The tiger eye is tuna and avocado wrapped in squid - it was expertly prepared.  It doesn't have a sushi restaurant feel though - it looks more like a sandwich spot - but that is only a side note.  The prices were reasonable.  This really is a nice little neighborhood spot with quality food and a friendly atmosphere.  I will go back when I am the green valley area."}
{"text":"We tried this for the first time after several neighbors recommended.  To be honest, we we are bit disappointed after reading all the wonderful reviews.  The service was excellent, and everyone was very friendly, but to be honest the sushi was just that not great.  Not bad by any means, but just very average.  For the money, it was fine, but we tried 4-5 rolls, and we felt it was very similar to others with this price point.   Not really a restaurant we would return to."}
{"text":"Efficient and friendly service, excellent lunch specials, sushi was fresh and delicious. Recommend the Tarantula roll, and their California roll was best I've ever had (simple roll, excellently prepared)."}
{"text":"3.5 stars. Went here for lunch with a good friend who loves sushi. Got there just as it opened and were warmly greeted and seated. Wow that rhymes!   Menu was pretty good full of plenty of choices, we both opted for a lunch special, I went with the Sushi/i #1 which had 3 pieces of nigiri and a 4 pc california roll. I added a philly roll too. My friend went with the box lunch of fried aji and kara-age.   First was a bowl of miso soup. I love good miso soup, but this wasn't it. Not bad, but tasted a bit bland and generic.   The food was good, the fish very fresh, but again nothing out of this world good. Just very average place. My friend who is more into sushi than I am, said the same thing, and he liked ta-tas or I Love Sushi more. So I will try those places out next time.   Wish this could have been more, based on previous reviews. I guess I will have to try some of their specialty rolls. I will try it again in the future."}
{"text":"Enjoyed the sushi bar. Prices are reasonable. The seaweed and fish tasted fresh. Tried Spicy Tuna Roll, California Roll, and Vegetable Tempura. I would try again if in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Every once in a while I have an intense craving for sushi, not a \"time of the month\" kinda thing, but a craving that leaves images and scents and flavors of sashimi, nigiri, and rolls completely polluting my mind. Now its a real pet peeve of mine when people consider themselves a self pro-claimed \"Sushi Connoisseur.\" \"Dahling, I've been to all the finest places and have had the finest, freshest fish!!\" Turns out they've been to I Love Sushi twice and they became an expert on raw fish with a damn California Roll. Aside from my digression, I'm not an expert, but I know what I want and how I want it. That being said, this review is biased (but I guess you could say that about them all).    First time here, my friend and I missed the $1 off specials by a few minutes, but I was alright with that because we were there for a good time. I always order a garlic tuna and fatty tuna first as my \"appetizer.\" Yes, did those tunas appetize me! I've noticed many sushi restaurants have their own rendition of garlic tuna, usually just soaked in garlic ponzu, but this had a thin smear of wasabi and was actually topped with minced garlic. My mouth is watering as I type this, but I still would prefer the simple soaked in garlic ponzu... (I've had too much change these past months.. So maybe I'll adjust). And of course the fatty tuna melted its omega-3s far too quickly once it hit my tongue.. It's a love-hate kinda thing.   We shared 3 rolls: dynamite, volcano, and tiger eye. We enjoyed all 3, but not for their price and the fact that the selection of rolls seem to have the same innards but are spruced up by different fish on top and/or the sauces they are smothered in.  Food and service give this a 3.5-4/5, price knocks it down. I left satisfied, but could have easily eaten more. I think this is a fun neighborhood spot, but I prefer getting the same quality with more bang for my buck. Luckily, I have a $1 off the bill next time...."}
{"text":"I walk in, sit down, and they already know what I want. They've never forgotten me from the past time i was here. This is customer service. Love is place."}
{"text":"I've been to this restaurant several times and have always been treated nicely. The food is good especially the creamy mermaid (appetizer). They're very fast in seating you and the food comes out pretty quickly. The hello kitty roll like others have said is really yummy. If you go during the lunch hour, the prices are really good for bento boxes. It's great for dates but, it's quite small for a group of more than four. The restaurant is very clean as well. Children can eat here too because they have meals that cater to them. I have nothing really bad to say about this place because overall it's a good restaurant. I'll be returning."}
{"text":"Best sushi and traditional Japanese restaurant we have found here in Las Vegas. Family owned and run by a husband, wife and daughter. Sushi is fresh and prepared perfectly. The chicken teriyaki was excellent as well. Even the miso soup was the best I've had since my last trip to Tokyo."}
{"text":"Love! I think I've found my go to casual sushi joint in the Henderson area. Rolls were fresh and tasty, service was good, and they have a fun little spin the wheel game to play after."}
{"text":"There are usually three employees, the sushi chef, kitchen chef and hostess/server. For such a small operation with about six tables and eight seats at the sushi bar they do a hell of a job."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place--especially since the owner/main chef is good friends with the fabulous folks at Shabu Shabu Paradise--but it was just ok.  I've had much better, tastier, and generously portioned sushi rolls & nigiri at Osaka and EN. The people are nice, though, and it's not BAD, per se.  If I lived a block away, didn't want to drive far, and was REALLY craving sushi, I'd go back. As it is, I've got such great sushi choices much closer to me that it's not worth making the few miles' drive over from Anthem."}
{"text":"The food is pretty good but better for a quick lunch than a nice dinner. The staff can be friendly but I have experienced them looking at me and speaking their language and laughing. When I questioned them they seemed to all of a sudden not speak English! !"}
{"text":"Today I had lunch at this restaurant and let me tell you the idea of a $5 lunch box in today's economy, is beyond unbelievable Till you try it, the $2.75 California roll I got to eat for under $10 including tip. What a deal.  The service was closer to 6 stars the server under stood my order and was overly attentive, with all the tables full, my water was never less than 1/2 full.  This type of restaurant would normally be 4 stars at best, but Emory made it perfect and got the 5th star."}
{"text":"Sushi Imagine had 4 1/2 star so I tried. I'm not a fan. Lacking freshness and quality. They do have a lot of choices on lunch specials. I guess it's ok if that all you are looking for.   I had toro. Uni not fresh, (had to spit out) and Salmon.  What really throws me off is the rice. Rice was not like sushi rice. It's hard and loose. I mean if they cant get the rice right, how can they get everything else together? Totally waste of time and money."}
{"text":"Finally had the famed Hello Kitty roll! For those who are wondering, I am pretty sure / if memory serves, it is shrimp tempura, cucumber, and yellowtail (maybe?) wrapped in seaweed and rice, then topped with more tuna and avocado, some kind of tiny egg (not the big roe, but the grainy-looking stuff), and mayo sauce. It was pretty good, though I was not completely blown away by it.   Had the Rock N Roll, which I personally liked better than the hello kitty roll. Next time we are going to try the Hot Rock Roll.  All the specialty rolls here look so good, and I know I can trust them to not be too ricey. I'm going to have to keep going back to try new things!   Also had the jalapeno bomb appetizer - deep fried jalapenos stuffed with spicy tuna and cream cheese - definitely has a little kick to it, the slow burning kind of jalapeno spicy that you don't realize is hot until you've already eaten all 4 pieces. I definitely ended up drinking an entire glass of water trying to eat these (but I am a wimp).   We had a creamy mermaid coupon and a $1 off coupon from last time, which they had no problem using at all.   The service continues to put this place over the top. Fast and friendly, just the way I like it. When we arrived on this visit, there was an open 2-person table near the door, but they cleared a 4-person table really quickly for us in the back, as it was pretty cold outside and there was a bit of a draft. Going to have to come back soon to use my $1 off coupon! What a great marketing idea :)"}
{"text":"I eat a lot of sushi and this little hole in the wall is one of my absolute favorites in town!  Try the hello kitty roll, jalapeno tuna, and rattle snake.  Delicious!  They have the freshest tuna I have found in the whole Las Vegas area!"}
