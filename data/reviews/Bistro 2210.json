{"text":"From its chic decor to its delicious, adventurous seasonal cuisine, Bistro 2210 is a definite \"must visit\" restaurant in Calgary.  Bistro 2210 is a small, upscale bistro along 4th St SW in the fashionable Mission District, run by upcoming chef Jason Armstrong.  The service is friendly, professional, and unpretentious, and the food is sublime. I'm a sucker for anything wrapped in bacon, so particular high marks go to their bacon-wrapped bison meatloaf, served with roasted potatoes and grainy mustard gravy - a lunch crowd favourite.  I'm also a big fan of their lobster corn dogs and smoked chicken ciabbata with sweet potato fries. I've never been there for dinner, but I can only imagine the flavour possibilities!  Bistro 2210 is open for brunch on weekends, and by far my favourite is the West Coast Benedict, with smoked salmon and asparagus.  Parking is tricky, but keep trying the side streets and eventually you'll score. I recommend reservations on weekends unless you want to wait."}
{"text":"I tried this restaurant rather reluctantly during Dine Out Calgary last month. My apprehension stems from my previous experiences during Dine Out events both here in Calgary and in Vancouver.  I found during these Dine Out events, restaurants would pre-make most of the dishes in advance due to the high volume of diners and this usually translates to less than stellar meals and usually not a good indication of what the restaurant is truly capable of preparing. That being said, most of the meals are usually decent and within acceptable range with the odd few that actually are very good.  By the time I went to Bistro 2210 for Dine Out, I had already read a few reviews about which dishes were hits and misses so I already strategically knew what to order from their Dine Out menu. For an appetizer, I ordered the duck confit poutine. It was decent.. the duck was tender and the gravy was flavourful. A few of my dining companions ordered the smoked chicken croquettes. I tried one and didn't find it to be all that impressive. While the texture was nice, I couldn't taste the chicken, let alone the \"smoked\" aspect of it.   For entree, I had the bison meatloaf. I thoroughly enjoyed that dish and was really glad I ordered it.  The asparagus that came with it was cooked to perfection. That being said, I had researched this in advance and knew this dish would be a hit.  If I ever went back, I would order the meatloaf again (it is on their regular lunch menu).   One of my dining companions ordered the sole stuffed with crab. I should mention, this was one of the dishes recommended by our server along with the meatloaf.  This dish was just WRONG! The crab stuffing had a funny taste to it (as if they used canned crab that wasn't very fresh). I felt sorry for my dining companion as she was stuck to finish the dish. There were also some chickpeas on the dish which was a strange pairing as the textures just didn't work.   The desserts (chocolate mousse, bread pudding and crepes) were all pretty good. I quite enjoyed the chocolate mousse and the crepes in particular.   If I had the rate this restaurant soley on the 3 items I ordered (duck poutine, bison meatloaf and chocolate mousse), I would give this place 3 stars. However, having seen and tasted some dishes that just weren't right (especially the sole stuffed with crab), I have no confidence in this place.  I can understand with each restaurant there are some hits and there are some \"ok\" dishes. But to have some dishes go completely wrong, it really worries me.   In order for me to go back, I would have to research ahead of time to know which dishes are \"safe\" to order and which to avoid."}
{"text":"Went for dinner with some friends on Saturday night. We started out on 17th avenue but we found that all the restaurants we wanted to go to had 1 hr + wait times. I suggested we try Mission instead, and we ended up at Bistro 2210. Very happy that our group of four could be seated immediately. Nothing worse than waiting to be seated when you are really hungry!!  We all ended up ordering a variation of the feature special. They were offering lamb, pork or steak, served with fries, broccolini, and truffle aoili. Our meals were very good. I'd love to go back and try the mac 'n' cheese!! And their vintage-inspired cocktails! Sadly I didn't see the sign promoting the cocktails until we were on our way out.   The restaurant has an upscale, but still neighborhoody (??) feel. I thought I saw someone bring in a bottle of their own wine, but I can't be sure if they offer corkage.   Agree with the previous reviewers about the size of the restaurant and the slightly boring atmosphere. All of the tables weren't full when we were there, but it may have felt crowded if they were. Maybe they could do with one less table in the room. Although, as I have learned from the Food Network; restaurant owners should be squeezing as many tables in as possible... I can see where some may find the atmosphere boring. It was fairly quiet when we were there, but that makes it a great place to go for good conversation. You definitely won't have to shout to be heard here."}
{"text":"I went to Bistro 2210 for my second breakfast there last weekend.  The first time was delicious but I was also a bit hungover from my wedding so I wanted to taste it again on an non-corrupt stomach.    The Bistro is a gorgeous place to dine and I will definitely have to come back to try dinner sometime soon because I can see it being very romantic with its beautiful lighting and small seating.    We both had the Breakfast Poutine ($12) and seriously, I must say, whomever invented the Breakfast Poutine is an honest genius.  Soft poached eggs with handcut french fries, delicious gravy and cheddar curds.  What more can I say?  It was amazing and I didn't have to eat for the rest of the day.  Swoon."}
{"text":"This is a beautiful, well-designed spot and the two times I've been for breakfast, I've been seated right away. Bonus. Where it falls down is the food - not quality but execution. We waited 30 minutes for three simple egg dishes. My toast was cold, eggs overdone, and the butter, though beautifully presented, was rock hard. Chef did try and make up for the eggs by sending two more but these were barely cooked. Unfortunately the espresso machine was also broken but that's just bad circumstance. I appreciate the effort on the eggs but I left feeling unsatisfied for the second time. It's a shame because on the surface, this place looks like it should be amazing."}
{"text":"Bistro 2210 described in a statement is a chic restaurant in a quiet, well appointed rustic french restaurant in a quiet atmosphere with excellent service. I had two glasses of wine along with a lamb shank.  The food was excellent with perfect flavor and presentation, but the portions were very small. I did appreciate the global wine selection. The waitress informed me they had expanded the list outside of a previously European exclusive selection. The restaurant also has a full bar.   I dined alone on a Thursday evening and had no trouble walking in without a reservation. In fact at 8pm I was only one of two tables. The atmosphere would be very conducive for a dinner meeting or a date as the music volume is low and there is adequate space between tables. Outside of this I probably wouldn't go on my own again unless I had a business meeting to schedule and my clients requested rustic french cuisine."}
{"text":"A wonderful intimate dining space, with friendly staff and great service.   The food is delicious -- the tuna nicoise was a great highlight for me, others had the nightly special and enjoyed it. Drinks and overall meal prices were good for Calgary.   My only complaint would be the consistency of food night-to-night. Sometimes this place rocks it, other times the food is over cooked or over salted and misses the mark wildly.   In my view one of 4th Street's overlooked spots, just wish the food was more consistent."}
{"text":"After a long hot walk, we were surprised to find no air conditioning. The wait people seemed more interested in socializing with each other and a few of the customers than taking our order and serving us in a timely manner. The wild salmon main course was very week.  The skin was left on giving it a strong fishy flavor that overwhelmed the lentils, fennel and the thin bland sauce. Worst of all, on of the  sweet potato fries from my husbands plate had made it's way into my dish.  When I pointed this out to the server she just laughed.  This told me that the kitchen staff was just as inattentive as the wait staff. The staff seems to have fun not running this place.  I wish I could say thesame for the customers."}
{"text":"At least my 5th visit....... Very good food, service, medium level prices,  nicely  furnished..... Great little Bistro and will return often.  By the way, good for breakfast"}
{"text":"BREAKFAST...   I have been to Bistro before for late night drinks and recall it being over priced and boring...  So on the hunt to try somewhere new for breakfast, I saw people inside and though, why not?  Well let me break it down for you,  If you are an overpriced basic breakfast, PLEASE at least hide behind some dazzled up gourmet toast... Run down to Safeway or the farmers market and but some artisan bread.  Sadly Bistro prefers the bagged cheap stuff. (-1 star)   I had the breakfast special, an omelet with pea shoots, porcine mushrooms and brie cheese. ($14)  Served with 3 mini potatoes cut in slices and the bagged bread.   But lets talk about the main event.  Why was the omelet so dark in color? Are you using real eggs or a boxed egg? Me thinks a boxed egg! (tisk tisk) (-.5star)   Brie cheese? You are soooooo cheap with the cheese! This omelet is $14... make the brie bigger then a 4x2 inch piece of thinly slice brie!  (-1 star)   So where is the missing (-.5 star)?  The service...  Sorry, lazy 16 year old girls don't make a $14 omelet taste better.   Wrapping up..   Pros:  - the place is beautiful, this is how I would design the interior of a restaurant  - I love white dishes and I like the little white ceramic pot of jam and ketchup  -The place is empty!   Cons:  -Over priced  -Boring  -Lacks flavor   So what to do?  Go next door to the PURPLE PERK and enjoy a better breakfast"}
{"text":"Wow.  Went Sat Nov 12th for an early dinner.  Got a seat by the window - nice for people watching...  Food was excellent.  Split the crab cake appetizer and had the bone in pork chop/ steak special  (mmmmmmm!!!!!!!!  drool)  Only 4 stars - not a huge menu, and server incorrectly informed me of the vegetable...was looking forward to broccolinni.  Also, only bottles of beer, no draft?  It is pretty small - I would feel cramped if there was people at the table beside me."}
{"text":"My friends & I dined here last weekend for Big Taste. I had never heard of them, but the menu looked delicious so we gave it a shot.  I LOVED the atmosphere here. Small & intimate, with low lighting and candlelit tables, I felt it had a super romantic ambiance, and would be a great place to bring a date, split a bottle of wine, and people watch. Our server was friendly and prompt - I ordered a glass of rose while the rest of our group stuck with water, which was never left unattended.  For our starters, I had the tuna \"nicoise\" which was delicious, but I wish it included more than 1 tiny quail egg. However, the tuna itself was excellent and I LOVED the olive tapenade underneath. My main was the Mushroom Fettuccine, which fell a little flat. The sauce was bland and not mixed well, and the pasta itself was very oily. My fiance ordered the Charcute Garni, which was basically pork loin, pork belly, and sausage, which didn't look very appealing, and honestly didn't taste that great. I had a bite of my friends Lamb Meatloaf, which was wrapped in bacon and tasted good, but the texture was off, a little too much like dog food for me. The Steak Frites were great and I LOVED the truffle aoli that came with the fries. Overall, I was a little disappointed with our mains, but thank goodness dessert saved the day! I had the butterscotch pudding with chocolate and salted caramel, it was soooo delicious I completely forgot about my main. We all tasted a little bit of each others and all of the desserts were fantastic. For $35 each, it was nothing to complain about, but also nothing to write home about.  It was great to try out a new spot, but I don't think I'll return to Bistro 2210 for food. I would definitely go back for the location and ambiance alone, but only for drinks."}
{"text":"Weekend brunch menu was odd...'eggs' items on one side, and maybe only 4-5 non-egg items on the other side - one being a burger ... so we shared Montreal eggs bene, and a burger.  Eggs bene was ok... not great... and after we pretty much ate almost of all of it, I realized that they gave us a regular bene instead of the Montreal bene (which is w/ smoked salmon).... oh well, didn't want to make a stink.  the burger was wayyyyyy too salty.  and i only got a taste of the truffle in the last few bites ....  otherwise it was non-existent.  Inside is very nice! but it was rather empty for a Saturday (considering purple perk next door -our 1st choice - was full & super busy on a cold snowy day .... 2210 is in  such a great location with nice decor.... If they had good food at reasonable prices people would be lining up outside too!"}
{"text":"So the food was ok...  Design of the place was ok...  Service was quite ok, even a bit more...  Food was rather a-ok, but not too bad...  So why 3 stars?  The bill.  Hello? Do you know how to convert a potentially nice place into a no-go decision? Put into that menu some ridiculous numbers, corresponding to a much more expensive restaurant. Which 2210 is not."}
