{"text":"Charming little cafe, that makes a great Latte."}
{"text":"Étant une fille de Villeray, le Cafe Vito est la première chose que je veux faire découvrir à mes amis en recherche de café dans mon quartier.  En passant, je n'aime pas le café, je ne suis pas quelqu'un qui aime en boire, je suis une fan de thé. J'adore le thé, Je meurs d'amour pour le thé. Vito pourtant fait un café pour lequel je marche les 4 rues qui le sépare de chez moi. Et Vito a réussi à me faire aimer le café.  Ses gelatos sont délicieuses aussi. À essayer. Mais si vous devez avoir du café et ce, malgré la canicule en plein été, vous devez absolument prendre son café glacé. Un pur délice."}
{"text":"Great coffee, great service..Always stop when I'm jn that hood. Quick service when I'm in a hurry, and relaxing when I need a break. Perfect! Great job guys:)"}
{"text":"Cozy little place, only a bar too sit at, though. No tables. Excellent latte, and the cappuccino was good. Good choice of panini as well (got the chicken one and really enjoyed it)."}
{"text":"Probablement un des meilleurs cafés en ville. Simple, agréable, heures d'ouverture intéressantes pour Villeray."}
{"text":"Dropped by for a small bite when we were in the neighborhood. My boyfriend is raving about the coffee, says it's better than anything he's had in Europe. The almond croissant was incredible, and we shared a Sicilian foccacia, which is a pastry filled with savouries - we had the pork, broccoli and Parmesan. All in all a delightful experience, and very friendly and proactive service. The owner clearly loves what he does and takes care of his customers."}
{"text":"I've known Vito for years and I'm ecstatic he finally has his own place!  Great coffee, great food, amazing croissants!  Come early, they run out fast!  Love coming here, like a second home."}
{"text":"Nice little cafe in Villeray, with pretty good cappuccino and freshly filled cannoli. But the best part was the friendly folks running the cafe. They added a really warm and welcoming feel in the cafe which I really loved."}
{"text":"J'ai apprécié ce tout petit café anglo italien dans ce quartier francophone qu'est Villeray. J'y ai été servie en francais, avec toute la gentillesse du barista. J'ai été  particulièrement touchée qu'on m'ait offert un café gratuitement après que j'ai échappé  le mien aussitôt la porte franchie. Ce sont de petits commerces comme ceux-là qui rendent Villeray si vivant.  Longue vie Café Vito.  BB"}
{"text":"I was there for their 5th anniversary June 3, 2017. Wow! can Vito throw a party. The day started overcast, which lead many to believe it was going to rain. The sun burnt away the clouds by 2 p.m. and everyone came out in true numbers. I'm thankful for the weather as it afforded me a 2nd taste of the fabulous cake! The ambiance was incredible as was the neighborhood feel & Vito's generosity.  I don't live/work nearby but it is definitely worth a trip for the coffee, staff and atmosphere."}
{"text":"I tried the espresso and small café latté. Deeply sweet yet richly tart, intricate. Slightly resembles to chocolate, plum, velvety mouthful. I'm impressed with the roasted beans they use because of its complexity in both flavour and structure, where sweet and tart are complicated by a hint of savory. i also picked up a pistachio& almond biscotti. Will be back"}
{"text":"Are you in montreal looking for a great and friendly place to have your coffee ? Go to cafe Vito! Super great coffee place. Owners are kind and always in a good mood. Go during the summer. They have benches outside and some little chairs. Recommend spending time during the World Cup. They have huge screens. They also sell some pastries (cannolis, croissants). Recommend either cappuccino with chocolate or latte.  Prices include taxes. Good prices. I took photos of the menu."}
{"text":"Love the service here! Everyone is always in a good mood. When you go into the Coffee shop in the morning you always hear Good morning! Always pleasant and the coffee is always perfect and they pay attention to little details like lactose free milk or almond milk for those who are vegan or those who have lactose allergies. Everyone talks together, so even if you  happen to go there alone your bound to have a nice conversation while having your coffee. Many people make this their daily stop and for good reason :) P.S. Try their cookies  they are so good, it's difficult having just one!!!"}
{"text":"The minute you walk in, you realize you've made an excellent decision. This tiny Italian cafè delivers rich, beautiful coffee and Italian breakfast pastries (Nutella croissant anyone!?), along with local charisma. This is the perfect spot to grab a coffee to go, or stick around to chat up locals waiting for their laundry. Love this place!"}
{"text":"EXCELLENT espresso. I watched my latté being made and the espresso was almost half crema. Mmmmmm.  As I sat outside at a table enjoying the late summer sunshine and sipping my drink, pretty much every person in the neighbourhood stopped by. Everybody seems to be a regular -- at least, everybody was treated that way.  Boy, do I wish this were in my neighbourhood so it could be my neighbourhood coffee shop. Maybe I need to move closer.   They have almond milk but not soy milk -- not my fav non-dairy option, but I appreciate that there is a non-dairy option.  This is one of the cafés participating in the Indie Coffee Passport (2014)."}
{"text":"Vito (the owner) used to be a barista at Olimpico, so right off the bat you know there is no funny business here. The coffee is just as delicious and the staff is as friendly as his old stomping grounds.   My favourite part about Vito's is that instead of going in, you can order coffee (and croissants which rule my world) by take-out window style. That's a bonus especially if you own a bark-happy dog like me. I love Cafe Vito."}
{"text":"Italian style coffee with freshly made cannolis. The space is really small and super casual. Went during summer so most most people were chilling outside and drinking their coffee in the small benches  just outside the coffee shop. There is only a few stools inside so not much place to sit. The cappuccino I had was splendid. Bonus points for the cutest dog."}
{"text":"A chill place in little italy. Vito's dog is the cutest dog ever. I'll go to this place again because of the dog. I had their cappuccino and cannoli, it was good."}
{"text":"Its cozy place at the corner, lots of taste in design as well as coffees!"}
{"text":"Probably the best cappuccino I have had in North America. A great neighborhood spot where my friends live. A true little cafe with plenty of outdoor seating."}
{"text":"Great no nonsense Italian coffee. Laundromat.   Go wash your clothes you filthy animal.  10/10 would launder again"}
{"text":"Oh my oh my...this place makes THE best iced coffee I ever had in my coffee drinking career. (which only began last year) It reminds of Vietnamese coffee but without that condensy-sweetish milk taste. I think I paid about 3-4 bucks for it, correct me if I'm wrong about the price. Anyways, it's located closest to Jean Talon metro and on the corner of the street. It's a really small place so don't expect to have a Second Cup/Starbucks feel to it. It's a very cozy Italian coffee shop with some stools and an itty bitty terrace when it's warm. I have only tried their ice coffee based on a recommendation from a blog. But I am sure their other coffees are just as good. They serve paninis as well, and other foods but I didn't try it.  Honestly, order the iced coffee and you won't be disappointed. I was certainly not, in fact if anything I was mind blown. I say this because I said to my friend, \"WOW this is good!!\" So check out this place if you're in the area!"}
{"text":"Love love love. Best iced coffee I have ever had. EVER. HAD. I stopped by here because it was literally across the street from where I was staying. At all times of the day, there was a crowd around it, even at 11pm, and given its proximity, I had to try. Since it was summer, iced coffee was the drink for me, and each time I took a sip, I was the happiest person in the world...or maybe just the happiest person walking toward Jarry Station.   Everyone who comes here seems to live really close by, and I feel like it's one of those places where you kind of just go to see your neighbors. I didn't get a chance to talk to many of the locals, but the community seems very tight knit. The kind of place where if you asked your neighbor for a cup of sugar, that they would give it to you rather than call the cops.   Since coming back to California, I've been trying to figure out ways how to replicate Café Vito's iced coffee, but I haven't even come close. All my tastebuds have are memories of this place, and for sure we're all coming back :)"}
{"text":"Fraîchement emménagé dans le quartier, je suis parti à la conquête des endroits, à la recherche de ma dose de caféine. Et à quelques rues de chez moi, le Café Vito est une découverte très agréable. Rien de bien bouleversant à la carte : on vous propose café (chaud, glacé, macchiato, etc.), d'autres types de boissons, mais aussi viennoiseries, collations et repas sur le pouce. Mais c'est son côté simple et rapide qui vous fait apprécier votre breuvage du jour. Un service rapide, efficace (et même souriant) vous mettra directement d'accord. D'autant plus que les prix restent corrects, pour une qualité irréprochable. J'avais pris un allongé avec du lait pour 2,50$, et pour une première, j'avais goûté à un réel café bien torréfié comme il se devait ! L'endroit est toutefois très petit, je vous conseille de prendre à emporter. En tout cas, cela n'enlèvera rien au charme du Café Vito."}
{"text":"C'est LE forum de Villeray. Café toujours impeccable, ambiance toujours fun parfois très animé, et service efficace et sympa.  L'été on y boit des cafés glacés au soleil à l'exterieur sous l'arbre, ambiance de village où tout le monde se mélange. L'hiver on apprécie la chaleur de l'endroit et d'un latte en regardant la neige tomber par la vitrine.  Haaaaaa on est pas bien là?"}
{"text":"Best coffee in Montreal. I go here on a weekly basis. It would be daily if I lived close by. Best lattes and iced coffees. The service is always excellent. The staff seem to remember and appreciate you. I recommend this place to everyone! One (minor) downside is the lack of seating space both inside and outside.. There are only a few seats and they tend to be taken."}
{"text":"A pesar del pequeño espacio, este local sirve de los mejores café que he probado en Montreal además de deliciosos cannoli. Un lugar para repetir varias veces solo o acompañado. 100% recomendado."}
{"text":"Beautiful looking neighbourhood, awesome coffee, friendly service and great positive people around!"}
{"text":"Italian coffee done right. My nonna would be very happy. An espresso from Vito is always welcome in my world. Not to mention, he's a kind guy too. You won't be disappointed. If you are, best to go to Starbucks and stay there. Ciao!"}
{"text":"I was going to be passing by the Villeray area on the way to do some errands so I decided to stop by a coffee shop that had good reviews from fellow Yelpers. So I dropped in on Cafe Vitto for an Allonge and a bagel.   The atmosphere was warm and friendly, the Alonge was on the bitter side but full and flavourful.   The owner is dedicated and very friendly. Definitely recommend if you are in the area."}
{"text":"Warm little gem up on Villeray near the parc! This tiny cafe seats about 7 people indoors, max, and even that is only on stools lining the windows looking out at the sweet duplexes and spiral staircases of this quiet neighborhood. The coffee is Olympico-perfect: that buttery, rich strong but not too bitter taste you're used to from sunny afternoons out on St Viateur. Vito himself pops out with a smile and a banter that makes everyone feel like a regular, and the glimpse of folks chatting, drinking coffee, and waiting on their wash in the laundromat behind adds to the feeling of neighborhood warmth that will make this place a magnet for me come snowfall."}
{"text":"bon café 2nd wave!"}
{"text":"Amazing little coffee shop on Villeray. Old school italian coffee with strong flavor.  You also get $1 off their canoli if you check in on Yelp."}
{"text":"Excellent café connu et reconnu à Villeray.    Vito est une personne adorable et enjouée. Toujours un plaisir de le voir!   Saviez-vous qu'ils ont une 2e succursale dans le Vieux-Montréal, près du Muvbox de homard, face à la rue McGill? :)  Un must!"}
{"text":"Excellent coffee, and coolest barista in town. This place is really tiny so don't expect to sit here and do your homework, there are Starbucks for that. This is a quick fix kind of place."}
{"text":"Great place to have an awesome coffee and satisfy your hunger with there assortment of food items . A good place to enjoy your day, chill and share a few laughs and knowledge with the peeps who frequent this super cafe. Service with a smile and a few jokes ."}
{"text":"Encore un endroit qui me fait regretter d'avoir quitté Villeray pour le Plateau...  Et qui pourrait bien me convaincre de redéménager.  Parce que, sur le Plateau PERSONNE ne fait un aussi bon café! P-E-R-S-O-N-N-E!  Et ça m'emmerde!  Un vrai espresso, bien serré, dans les règles de l'art, à l'italienne, voilà ce qu'on sert chez Vito, et à un prix tellement dérisoire (1,75$!).  Avec ça, ils servent quelques trucs à manger, qui sont bons, et à un prix très raisonnable aussi.  Et si, en plus, on ajoute un décors simble et chaleureux, tout en bois, une terrasse où on peut regarder les machs de foot en bonne compagnie, c'est dur de ne pas devenir fan!"}
{"text":"Due to the addition of fresh cannolis I'd like to up the review from 4 to 5 stars. I am a cannoli fan and these ones are light, crispy and freshly piped to order. Vito buys the shells from Cornetteria (St. Laurent bakery that specializes in cornetti, cronetto, cannolis and more) and they are fresh daily. YES!  Although winter is coming the Greek yogurt gelato and granita are still favorites and although I haven't yet sampled them they have tasty looking sandwiches and other sundries as well.   Oh, and don't forget there's a laundromat in the back so bring your laundry and make your café visit productive AND delicious."}
{"text":"A small café full of charm, few seats inside, sunny ones outside, great coffee (one of the best Mocha I had so far)  And not even 3$ for a bagel with cream cheese on it ? Yes, I like that"}
{"text":"Great quaint coffee shop. Small with great service. Excellent option in the summer to enjoy a coffee outside."}
{"text":"Amazing little hang out for great coffee and good company! Vito is also like a neighborhood mayor...good laugh!"}
{"text":"Works as advertised; It's a guy called Vito, selling coffee. I dropped in here as part of the Indie Coffee Passport, and it was totally worth the trip up-town.  The coffee was really really good (as Risa said in her review it's \"Olympico-perfect\"). I had heard other people talking about their fresh cannolis, and I've got to say it was one of the best. They add the cream when you order it, so it's super-fresh; The cream is fluffy, the shell is crispy, and it's all good."}
{"text":"Had a vegan latte with almomd milk and a banana chocolat bread also vegan. Coffee was rich and bold \"phénoménal\". The banana bread was rich and moist. Great quality and a great find for the area. Highly recomended even for the non Vegans. Great place to hang out for the sports afficionattos. The even had TV's outside"}
{"text":"Ended up being in this part of the town.  First thing I noticed? The quick and efficient is the barista here. Walked in, ordered my cappuccino and a croissant and before I had time to sit down and pick up the newspaper I was given my treats. I was shocked how quickly it happened.   And the cappuccino was probably the best I've tasted in Montreal for a long long while. The croissant was disappointing though as it just didn't feel that fresh. I'm unsure if they were made that morning or last night but a greater care must be done to make sure those things stay fresh!  The place is small, able to seat about half a dozen people or so and with the influx of customers coming in and out it can get crowded, pretty damn fast. However, the barista is incredibly good at his trade and those coffees come out like magic.   Heck, people waited outside on the side window to give their order. It was very impressive and I found myself looking at him work instead of reading the newspaper.  Price tag was just about right, coming to $5 + tip. (i like to tip!)  As a Yelper, checking in providing me 1$ off a cannoli but I didn't take advantage of the offer. Maybe next time. Will be definitely be visiting again if I'm coming back this way."}
{"text":"Bagels and lattes were amazing. Vito remembers everyone and is very personable. If you're new to Montreal or just here for travels, this is a must go to place. A little pricey for a cheap Bostonian, but totally worth it."}
{"text":"The most DELICIOUS espresso I've ever had! So rich n creamy! No milk or sugar needed. By far the best in Montreal!"}
{"text":"Amazing coffee! Nice small coffee place. Love it especially during summer times. The coffee tastes really good. Try try try"}
{"text":"This is the best coffee in Montreal, and the best place to have it. But the point is the coffee, not sitting around staring at a laptop, so don't expect it to be Starbucks. It reminds me more of Italy.  Having a coffee at Cafe Vito makes me imagine a completely other life I could have had, living around the corner, chatting with the guys here over a daily coffee or two. Just sitting on a bench here while you have a latte lets you hear what's up in the community, because it seems like everyone who can get out of the house stops here. There aren't a lot of places like this anymore. It makes me happy."}
{"text":"The cannoli is filled fresh and very crispy. I liked the flavour and it wasn't very heavy. The iced latte had a really good flavour.  But ask for it for here if you're staying otherwise they'll put it in a plastic cup unfortunately!"}
{"text":"Je dois avouer que j'ai du faire un effort pour m'y rendre. Si ça n'étais pas de mon Indie Coffee Passport, je ne serais probablement jamais allée parce que c'est celui qui est le plus au nord. Mais je suis bien contente d'avoir fait le détour.  C'est un tout petit café avec des chaises hautes le long des murs, et quelques petites tables à l'extérieur. On y va donc pour prendre un latte, ou bien un espresso, et peut-être une pâtisserie ou un panini, et on en profite pour prendre son temps. Ça n'est pas idéal pour y travailler, à moins que vous ayez de la lecture à faire ou bien si vous êtes du genre à écrire dans un petit carnet. Je ne sais pas pourquoi, mais l'endroit me donne vraiment l'impression d'être fait pour que les gens d'y arrêtent et prennent le temps de respirer un peu, et de relaxer, l'instant de boire un café. Il en faudrait plus des petits oasis de relaxation comme ça il me semble!"}
{"text":"0 authenticité. 0 ambiance. Nourriture très mauvaise. Les croissants sont froids et durs et ils font du mocha avec du Nesquick. Pas de tables. Serveur qui vous parle en anglais (on est à Villeray, quoi). Musique forte. Tout le contraire d'un café de quartier où les gens discutent autour d'une table. C'est plutôt un comptoir à café."}
