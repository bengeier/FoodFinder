{"text":"It is not my first time here, and every time I enjoy it more and more! For the breakfast they have a new special for 5.45 only, But I have decided not to have it because it includes a regular coffee and trust me you do not want to skip the latte they are making, it is the best latte in Richmond Hill! For breakfast Rkitchen offer big variety of eggs and sandwiches. I went with omelet and a small r salat it came with bread of your choice I tried the olive bread .I enjoyed everything this morning."}
{"text":"Thanks to Raffi and his team for the great Valentine's evening. I'd not been to Rkitchen before and I enjoyed the food and the ambience."}
{"text":"Yummy food. Great atmosphere. Server was very nice. Decor is good. Place is clean. We really liked the food."}
{"text":"THEY ARE CLOSED, OUT OF BUSINESS. Went there with my boyfriend for our anniversary. The app said they take reservations, we googled the phone number, but it wasn't working. Anyway we decided to go and see if they will have space. To our disappointment it was CLOSED! Like out of business. The sight was still eliminated, and the phone number that we called was on the sight as well. But inside there were only boxes and some garbage. Door was obviously locked. Someone please update it, so that people will know that the place closed down. Ended up going to I takin place three doors down. Still, very disappointing."}
{"text":"Had lunch here today. Got the protein wrap with a side Caesar salad.  Very good food! Would recommend for sure!"}

The haddock was pretty delicious as well. Burger not so great and tr people I was with flipped over the mushroom soup as in the LOVED it 
Will be back for sure"}
{"text":"I have been here a few times for Breakfast, lunch and dinner, Food is really good. Great service and the prices are really good considering the quality of the food. 
Highly recommend!!!!"}
{"text":"The customer service is good and the house salad they bring is pretty good as well, but the rib steak was the worse steak I've had in my life. It was not fresh and the sauce had no taste to it.
I will not go here again."}
{"text":"A convenient location, we picked this as a get-together and celebration to the end of a busy season for work.  Service was good and the waitress was able to get all the orders right for the most part.  

The grilled tahini eggplant was just okay with a serious lack of flavour.  Stuffed portobello mushrooms were good but again, lacked a bit of flavour and the mushroom was a bit too moist for my liking.  

Our pastas all required additional salt although I resisted, wondering if there was secret salt that I just wasn't tasting.  But I saw everyone dump salt in their bowls of pastas.  The funghi linguine was okay but it did have too much oil in the bottom.  

Overall, pricing was fair but I could get better Italian food for that same price.  The good thing about this dinner was that we were in good company and had a good time.  Would I go back alone?  Probably not."}
{"text":"I really enjoy the food . Have tried most of the menu and it is very consistent good quality and food fantastic. The service is good as well."}
{"text":"R Kitchen, a newcomer to the area. It is not really \"new\" as it atmosphere and menu is relatively similar to Mirage and Symposium. 

It describes itself as \"moderately priced trendy International / global restaurant located in the Richmond Hill area of York Region. R Kitchen specializes in International / global cuisine and features breakfast, brunch..\"

Maybe being trendy is having hip music pumping through the speakers? The menu here is boring and pricey. 

Steak Sandwich ($14) serves with a market salad was medicore as best. The salad was lifeless even without the dressing on. Steak was cooked medium rare but was chewy and hard with all the fat and trimming still on.

I told the waitress about the salad and she said the chef insisted that it was fresh... so don't order salad, I warned you!

During late afternoon just don't sit in the solarium area, the sun can be blinding and bring your sunglasses. At first my waitress  would not let me move, but I was persistent. The restaurant was empty, why can't a paying guest move to a better and comfortable area?!

The experience at R Kitchen was just disappointing. I doubt I would ever be back."}
