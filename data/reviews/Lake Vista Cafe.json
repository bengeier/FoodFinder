{"text":"Second time eating there. Great food. Only thing that sucks is if it is windy out... Fun place, unique selections, great view."}
{"text":"this outdoor cafe on the Monona Terrace is fantastic - good food, excellent salads, reasonable prices, and right over the lake.  did I mention it is outside?  when the weather is good, which does happen around here, it is a really lovely spot."}
{"text":"Rooftop cafe, terrific lake view with yummy foods, not expensive. We happen to meet while walking along the Monona lakeside Will come again."}
{"text":"Views of the capital on one side and view of Lake Monona on the other side, this cafe is located on the 6th floor of the hotel. Overall the food was tasty and the libations were welcome refreshment on a sunny and warm day"}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this outdoor cafe after watching the Mad-City ski team out on Lake Monona. If you're looking for a quick bite accompanied with a lovely view, I highly recommend eating here.  Standard menu consisting of burgers, sandwiches and of course, beer. I ordered the chicken sandwich, which comes with homemade chips, and it came out in a jiffy."}
{"text":"We stayed at the Hilton Monona Terrace and tried this place for dinner. As other reviews said, the Chicken sandwich was quite good. Messy but good. Decent beer selection, and the lake views can't be beat."}
{"text":"This is quickly becoming my favorite place to bring people who are visiting from out of town because the food is delicious and the views just can't be beat. It also seems like quite the hidden gem - I've gone a few times now and it's never packed.   I took my parents here when they were in town and I had the farmers market tomato salad. It was incredibly refreshing, the tomatoes were probably some of the juiciest tomatoes I can remember eating, and the mozzarella was fresh and just enough. My mother had shepherds pie and my dad had salmon and they were both great as well. I've also had their falafel salad, which comes nicely plated and is light and delicious to boot, as well as their truffle fries.The service has always been friendly and efficient.   They also have a bar and stock Spotted Cow. What's more Madison then drinking Spotted Cow while taking in beautiful views of Lake Monona? If you haven't been here yet, I highly recommend a visit."}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised by the food here! Orders are placed at a window and expediently delivered. Everything we ordered was very good - their grilled cheese with tator tots especially hit the spot. The menu was surprisingly diverse and creative. The view is of the expansive lake, and while the seating is simple tables with umbrellas, it's a great place to hang out when the weather is nice."}
{"text":"If I'm downtown when the sun's out, this is the best place to while the day away. It's now become a tradition, whenever we are in need of respite from the bustle, we'll steer towards our favorite spot at Lake Vista Cafe. The drinks are well made, reasonably priced, and you can enjoy one of the best views by the capitol.   I haven't tried much of the food here, but the portobello frites were fantastic - crispy and flavorful. The bloody mary is impressive for a patio - it comes with a sausage stick and beer chaser among other things - and if you like fruitier drinks I recommend the frozen raspberry pi√±a colada.    As long as there's no private event going on at the terrace, this is a tranquil watering hole where you can chat with friends under the sun and away from the crowds."}
{"text":"Awesome restaurant! Casual setting with great views of the lake from more than 8 floors up. Great views of the lake. I had a Rueben and my mom got the falafel salad which was the food choice to get. The french fries were alright albeit a little crispy and a little more couldn't have hurt. All in all it's a great place with fantastic attentive service"}
{"text":"Food is pretty good - got a sampler plate of three different kinds of tofu. Wasn't sure what to expect, but it was pretty flavorful and tasty!  Service was excellent! So friendly and helpful.  And of course, the view can't be beat. Right on the top floor of Monona Terrace and surrounded by pretty flowers.  Definitely give this place a shot!"}
{"text":"The food was excellent. The Ruben had huge chunks of local corn beef!! The hamburger was excellent as well. Highly recommend this place.  Oh and the view of the lake is cool."}
{"text":"This is the rooftop restaurant at the top of Monona Terrace.  Great food and atmosphere.  A hidden Gem in the downtown area. You order at the window and get a number and the food is brought out to you. I had the brisket sandwich and my partner had the Cuban sandwich appetizer. Both were very good and large enough that we brought some home. They also pour a generous gin and tonic and the prices are very reasonable.The service is very good and the people friendly. The view of Lake Monona is great and the tables with umbrellas comfortable. You can get up there from the bike trail entrance or the main entrance. There are stairs so you don't have to go inside to get to the restaurant. Don't miss if in the downtown area."}
{"text":"Farmers market tomato salad and homemade fries. Can't beat the view and the atmosphere. Great, quick, courteous service."}
{"text":"Surprised by this place. Good view, reasonable prices, free wifi and although there is no service they me offered to walk along with the drinks.  On the down side: no service (order at a window), everything is served in plastic and there was a (not sure if describe this correct in English) strong odeur of grease. Like the should change their frying oil. Overwhelming."}
{"text":"Wow, we were needing to eat lunch anyways before our tour of Monona Terrace.  So, we got this as a recommendation from the front desk.  My girlfriend and I had the fish tacos and soup of the day which was red pepper parmasean.  We finished it together and enjoyed every bite.  We were served quickly and felt like it was a definite step up of other museums.  It was soo good that we came back for dinner to see the water skiing competitions.  I had the BLT salad with fried egg and my girlfriend had the falafel salad.  She felt a bit too much with the taziki salad dressing but I thought it was fine but a bit too much cucumber.  Mine was perfect and the egg was nice over a crisp bread piece.  Price is very reasonable and don't have to wait for a table.  Lunch was about $10 and dinner was closer to $20.  Enjoy a nice view while having lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"Beautiful on a sunny day. Excellent outdoor patio. Food is amazingly good for a walk up window. We all had the chicken sandwich. Very tasty!"}
{"text":"Nice outdoor cafe with a view of Lake Monona. Good food and presentation is appealing like in fancy restaurants. Excellent service."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places to go. The vodka lemonades are really good and the food is yummy. The scenery is great and it is very relaxing sitting up there"}
