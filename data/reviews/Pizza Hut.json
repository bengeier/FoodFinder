I called back in spoke with a so called manager he said sorry blah blah next Pizza is free for the troubles well I called back in few weeks later there was no notes in system so no free pizza. Honesty goes a long way when your a business owner!"}
{"text":"Super friendly customer service. Fast, Fresh & Great tasting food. Usually Pizza Hut has a rep for being greasy. But I've been to this place twice and both times I've been satisfied. The hubby too (most important)"}
{"text":"My pizza and wings were very good! Brandon was very patient, kind, and personable with my daughter and I. He even offered her water while we waited for our food."}
{"text":"I have been disappointed time and time again with this Pizza Hut!  I think I have finally learned my lesson and will be taking my business elsewhere.  The last four times there has been something wrong with my order. They always seem to forget the extra marinara sauce I order, yet charge me for it. The pizza has been cold. And this last time the breadsticks were so hard, I had to throw them away. Mind you, I keep going back because I do love the chicken wings, but I think I have finally had enough."}
{"text":"WORST SERVICE EVER!! I had ordered a meal from Pizza Hut about 45 minutes from when they said it would be delivered. They said it would arrive around 7:00pm so around 6:30pm I waited by the door looking out the window with credit and cell phone in hand. With no sign of any delivery driver (let alone a knock on the door), I called Pizza Hut around 7:15pm. They claimed that the driver had come twice already and they were not able to get a hold of me. After arguing with the Manager (who was completely unprofessional) he hung up on me. Never again will I be ordering from this place."}
{"text":"This is the worst Pizza Hut I have ever been to. I was up-charged for something I didn't order. When I asked for it to be corrected it was done wrong again, given the wrong change and had the drive thru door slammed in my face. Asked to speak to the manager and he was extremely hostile. He took my change, receipt and food. After some time I asked for a refund and was told that wasn't possible, too much paperwork. Asked for his supervisors number and was told he was the highest manager, there was no one above him. Right. 

I went to the next Pizza Hut and asked for the regional manager number. I left the food at the restaurant because I was no comfortable eating it after he took it back to correct their mistake. Not sure what could have been done to it.

The young girl at the window did get it wrong twice, but the example the store manager gives is piss poor and is the issue. I hope Pizza Hut sees who they have working for them and speaking on their behalf because according to this store manager, Tim, he's the owner and CEO of the company. I highly doubt that."}
{"text":"Are you kidding me. How hard is it to answer a phone call within a reasonable amount of time and not letting a customer sit on hold for over ten minutes then answer the phone, not say a word and hang up. I just called another store in a more busy location and they answered the phone in less than a minute!"}
{"text":"Don't order online on a Saturday evening.  Pizza was not ready on time.  Stood in line and told 5 minutes.  Asked again, told another 5 minutes.  Still wasn't ready.  Time on board said another 17 minutes.  I told them I was not waiting anymore and walked out.  Don't tell me not once, but twice the pizza would be ready in 5 minutes and not have it ready."}
{"text":"I had stopped going to this location after I spoke with the general manager at the time. She was very snotty and rude.
Last night my family wanted Pizza Hut and being the closest to my house I had to go to this location. It felt like a completely different store. The cashier told me they are under new management and that Summer (the manager I spoke with) is no longer there.
I will be ordering from this location from now on. The staff was so friendly and the store was decorated with all these awesome drawings of the staff. 
You can really see the difference since the new management."}
{"text":"Ordered Pizza. Received Burnt and cold..when we called location was told we would have to wait 40 minutes for  a new delivery and was not offered an apology for the inconvenience by customer service.  The driver was nice and said sorry, he didn't see the pizza, and if he did he would of nit delivered the burnt pizza. ..will never order from this location again. Didn't expect a discount, only some quality control would be nice."}
{"text":"This has to be one of THE WORST pizza huts in charlotte!!

I absolutely HATE ordering from this place. The customer service stinks and the delivery people always take their time. It's better to just go to the store yourself and get behind the counter and make your own pizza, because that seems to be the only way you're going to get your pizza in a timely manner. 

No really, it's better to go to the store and order, because calling them on the phone is like a hit or miss. I have to call on AVERAGE 9 times before I can get my order through. I found out I have a friend who works there, so I text them to see if they're working, and if so, I put in my order through them. Now that is so GHETTO! Just like the whole restaurant. I should NOT have to do that, just to order some pizza.

If you reach someone on the phone, IF THEY ANSWER, 8 times out of 10 they will hang up on you, or put you on hold for 15 mins or more. I absolutely hate this Pizza Hut. They should close down, hire new workers or something. It's like they're so lazy and customers ordering is a game to them."}
{"text":"Out of all the Pizza Hut's in the Charlotte area, this one is the best! I used to live in the University area, so this one delivered to us, which was a plus. I have also eaten inside with my family and friends. 

I ordered a cheese pizza, honey bbq wings, and breadsticks. It arrived in a timely manner, and I was starving so I paid the delivery guy and checked my food. Upon inspection of my pizza, I guess the guy had sat something heavy on top of the box so when I opened it, ALL of the cheese was stuck to the top of the box. The guy apologized, and called me in a new pizza. He came back within a decent amount of time, and my pizza was hot and delicious.

Like I stated before, I used to love ordering from this pizza hut when I lived in the University area. Great customer service, delicious food, and atmosphere."}
{"text":"Nice location: not crowded and fast and very friendly service.

This review refers to a carryout order of the newly re-introduced Cheesy Bites pizza. Generally I am not a fan of Pizza Hut, I find their Pan Pizza too greasy.

 I have tried the Cheesy Bites in many places around the world and especially in Europe it was a-m-a-z-i-n-g. So the European version of the Cheesy Bites is my benchmark. (for pizza connoisseurs, yes it was Pizza Hut and it was that good)

The Cheesy Bites themselves I was slightly disappointed when comparing them to the EU ones. The European ones were big, puffy and filled with cheese. These \"new\" ones were smaller, crispier and without as much cheese. They were actualy smaller version of the Stuffed Rolls Pizza Hut had. I should point out here that the cheese had a slight tanginess I didn't like (same as with Stuffed Rolls);  mind you I am very eclectic (and even weird) when it comes to cheese (for example I hate cheddar, unlike 95% of people) so unless you've tried other versions of the Cheesy Bites you probably won't notice the difference. 

Otherwise the crust and sauce were just perfect. The crust was chewy and soft without greasiness or sogginess and combined with the sauce it had a very pleasant sweet taste.

The price for the large Cheesy Bites was about $12 or $15 if you choose a specialty pizza (like the Lovers pizza) and while it may not be the cheapest pizza in town, especially for a pizza chain, is good value for something different. If you just want great cheap pizza try Jesse's Pizza or Pizza My Dear for $5.

The pizza was baked adequately, maybe it would be better with a minute less or so but the baking at Pizza Hut is usually automated.

The place wasn't crowded on a Friday night and service was fast and very warm and firendly, such a rarity these days.

Overall I'd give this version of the Cheesy Bites 8.5/10 and this store 4.5/5."}
{"text":"I usually love Pizza Hut, but after visiting family members, I have a different opinion.

We ordered online. We ordered a custom pizza. 

It took really long for them to deliver it considering it was pretty close... 

When we got the pizza, almost every thing was wrong.

Wrong crust, wrong sauce, wrong toppings.

We were a little disappointed over how long it took to get the pizza, but even more disappointed about how the order was completely messed up."}
{"text":"Terrible store. Had a ridiculously bad customer service and food experience, they never bothered to even respond to my complaint. Will never be back."}
{"text":"Absolutely the worst made pizza I've ever had. So little cheese that u could even actually see any.  Be sure to see photo"}
{"text":"After a long day of volleyball we we ready to enjoy our pan pizza. We ordered it and they told us it would take an hour. We waited an hour and a half and then we received a call. They called to say it would be another 2 hours for the pizza. We cancelled. We were very disappointment with this pizza hut and ended up ordering from papa john. 30 minutes later it was here. Thank u Papa Johns!"}
{"text":"Pizza was under cook.  Very disappointed about Pizza Hut, as a Pizza lover.  Not satisfied period! Could have experience better customer service."}
{"text":"Pizza huts food takes like crap!"}
{"text":"I just had the worst customer service and food service ever! My order was late 25 minutes the guy that says to be the store manager by the name of Eddie has no clue how to do he's job right when I asked him how long has my food been siting in the warmer he replied he didn't know meaning my food has been sitting there for awhile while 4 other people got there food before me. When I approved him about my food been late he didn't even asked how he could accolade me or make it better he never showed me my pizza so when I got to my car and saw it it was the wrong order if I wouldn't of checked it I would of got home with a late order and wrong order. By the time I got home my pizza was no where near hot it was just warm and the cheese wasn't melted anymore and that's how I enjoy pizza my pasta was cold so we're my wings. I do not recommend this location to anyone I hope on Monday when I sleep to the franchise manager he can explain to me why there's such bad management and customer service"}
{"text":"This is the slowest pizza hut to ever exist. Over an hour and a half for a delivery that was .6 miles away. Absolutely ridiculous. I could have gotten the order faster if I had placed it at a pizza hut that was further away. The pizza was no longer hot and the wings were disgusting. So disappointed."}
{"text":"First off i am NOT a greasy pizza hut person but wife wanted it so i Called in got a better deal than online. Guy was cool as can be on the phone..the the food. It was actually AMAZING I mean one of the best pizzas I had in a long time and NO GREASE. ... major thanks to the people at this store you guys rock and make great pizza...."}
{"text":"Don't order a pie with spinach unless you like your spinach raw. They don't cook it into the pizza they just throw it on top when it is done cooking.  No where online when you order spinach on your pizza does it say that it will be raw. I asked the  cashier about this and he just made a joke about it looking like a salad. Really? I had to get a frozen pizza from the grocery store. It is sad when a frozen pizza tastes better than a \"fresh\" one."}
{"text":"Very dirty, heard the workers talking about going outback to smoke pot. Very disappointing business. Food was cold. Left it sitting out for a long time before they even brought it to me. My husband and I will never be going back that's for sure. Left a 5 dollar tip and heard the waitress talking about how I didn't leave a big enough tip for her."}
{"text":"I placed an order online and I was told 10-15 minutes more once I arrived because they were backed up, that's fine. 25 minutes later I see one person storm out mad because his order was never placed. I asked for the status of my order and it also wasn't placed. 5 minutes later my order comes out looking completely disgusting. I spoke with Eric (assistant manager) then I spoke with Cherry (The Store Manager) they stated that if I needed to complain to someone else about this then they have no one for me. At first Cherry did not even want to come out, as the store manager she should feel more responsible for her staff and for the quality of the food, instead she seemed less sympathetic for my wait or quality of food than the other employees. -- Maybe it's fault for thinking this place would provide quality.... I have pictures for all to see."}
{"text":"I mean it's Pizza Hut what do you actually expect. But I can say there a new pizzas are terrific and actually tasteful!"}
{"text":"I love the FAST SERVICE I always get my pizza right away never had to wait longer than 25 mins for my order  always warm and the drivers are so NICE. When I have gone in to order love the attitude the cashiers have had by far the best Pizza Hut in Vegas  thanks so much guys you guys are really awesome"}
{"text":"I ordered a pizza and wings. The young lady came to deliver. She was very nice but did not have enough change for my $50 bill. I called the location and asked could she get changed. He informed me she couldn't carry more than $15 for the safety of the drivers. That's perfectly fine but he did not give me another solution. This location has TERRIBLE customer service."}
{"text":"This place sucks. This is the 4th time we've ordered for delivery and they've left off at least 4 toppings, that cost extra. I get that it's only a dollar or two per topping, but it's stupid to pay 5 extra dollars to not receive ANYTHING that you paid for. We asked for garlic parmesan sauce with hut favorite crust. Got the original red sauce, with plain crust. The wings were supposed to be medium buffalo and we received bbq....HOW DO YOU GET THOSE CONFUSED? To have a messed up order once is understandable, but every single time is so ridiculous. Won't be back. Don't waste your time."}
{"text":"Waited 2 hours for a delivery. I called and at first they could not find my order, then they apologized and told me my pizza would be in shortly and they would give me a credit for next time...well there will be no next time. I think waiting for 2 hours for a pizza was too much!"}
{"text":"I ordered the garlic knot pizza with about 6 or 7 toppings along with one of the brownie desserts about a week ago, & when it arrived, it was not what i had ordered online. Ordering online makes it very specific, i would think. My pizza should have been double checked before leaving the store. The reason it was an issue is because my sister has dietary restriction that does not agree with what i ordered on my half of the pizza. Not only was it missing the extra BBQ drizzle sauce, but at least 3 of the 6 or 7 toppings were missing as well. We were not very happy about that. I called to discuss the issue and they told me they would replace my pizza free of change, no problem..  I called this evening to reorder my garlic knot pizza, & i spoke with Devon. He was VERY polite, & assisted me in replacing my pizza. I even changed the toppings. I thought I'd ask about the possibility of having the brownies replaced as well because i love dessert after dinner, & he made it happen with no issue at all. He confirmed my contact information in the system, & told me it would all be taken care of. . My pizza just arrived. Hot, & just the way i ordered it. & thankfully, the chocolaty,warm brownies are here as well. I am very happy with the service i have recieved, given the fact that this is quick eats. Thank you Devon! & thank you Pizza Hut!"}
{"text":"Am I forced to give a single star?? Yelp fix this issue first. Coming back to Pizza Hut, this girl working on 7/25/14 @ 8:45 pm was rude and mean to me after I gave them almost $600 business. She says she can't deliver to me being mean and rough and hung up phone on me. Fire her because that's not a good customer service. My business is not going to freaking Pizza Hut anymore just because of her."}
{"text":"The incompetent girl taking pizza orders for delivery last night clearly sucks at her job. She said her delivery driver was outside my place calling me several times and even left a message. Prove it. We waited an hour and she didn't think to try calling the number as well? Instead she just cancelled my order all together. I know for a fact I gave her the correct phone number. It definitely wasn't a mistake on my behalf that's for damn sure. I recommend you don't go here. EVER. She hung up on me and blamed me for it. Unreal. Customer service here blows. She didn't even try and make it right and send me a new one. Go to Z Pizza, Pino's or Dominos. Seriously anywhere but here! Especially if that girl still somehow has a job there."}
{"text":"Extremely disappointed with this store. I went to this location around 10 pm on a Saturday and all of the lights were turned off as if the store was completely closed, when their closing time is supposed to be at 12AM. So I called and was surprised that someone actually answered. The guy sounded like he was sleeping and didn't want to bothered (Obviously had the lights off for a reason). I was parked in front of the parking lot and saw the associate turn on all the lights like they should have been in the first place. I reluctantly ordered 2 pizzas and immediately was concerned about the quality of food I would be receiving, so I never picked them up. I couldn't believe someone would be so lazy to actually make the store \"look\" like they were closed. Pizza Hut is paying him to do absolutely nothing! I usually choose Pizza Hut among other competitors but not after this experience."}
{"text":"Apparently Pizza Hut forgot to put my spinach on my pizza until the last minute before delivery.  First time ordering from this location. Normally pretty good from others but this one was cold on delivery and a quality was not that great."}
{"text":"I called this one in instead of doing it online, so I was relying on the person on the phone (Ray) to let me know what kind of specials that were going on. 
I was greeted by Teyanna who was friendly and quick to take care of the transaction. She also let me know about the promotion to win cash and prizes if you go online and let Pizza Hut know about your experience.

Pizza was cooked the way it should be and no drama going on behind the scenes, I waited for my pizza to be done. I understand this is a pick up location so not a whole lot of emphasis should be put in the area when you pay and pick up your pizza...."}
{"text":"ordered online. got a large stuffed crust pizza with extra cheese and a medium 2 topping pizza. delivery guy was nice. order came on time, not early, not late. medium pizza toppings were missing and my large was cut into 6 slices. will go there again based on the service. hopefully they'll get the order right this time and the guy cutting my pizzas is not high."}
{"text":"20 minutes late on my pick up, all they had to do was make the pizza I was my
Own delivery boy. I should have got a tip for waiting so long and so patiently."}
{"text":"Unfortunately this location has terrible customer service they cannot take in order to save their life even when you do it online and you're giving them an order in black-and-white every time I order I always get a different order it's too bad I don't have enough time for them to correct the mistakes."}
{"text":"We arrived late from the east coast and it was past \"our\" bedtime. We ordered in from this place. The pizza was great and hit the spot. The notification told us that it would arrive at a certain time. I called them when it was past time (because we were hungry!) and the guy told me the driver had just left and that their internet was not working right. He arrived a few minutes after that. We ordered a large meat-lovers pizza with stuffed crust. Completely satisfied. The delivery guy was polite and friendly as well."}
{"text":"It's always exactly as you'd expect. The beauty of Pizza Hut. Nothing fancy but fast and tasty"}
{"text":"Ordered a large pizza for pick up, regular cheese sauce, and one topping of strip bacon. Didn't mind spending the $16.90 to get my favourite pizza once a week from Pizza Hut although this was first time from this location. Was disappointed at the lack of cheese sauce and bacon, they're obviously undercutting on the ingredients big time to save money, I couldn't bother to complain and wait for a new one to be made, was too hungry. Thinking about getting Pizza Hut? I suggest use a different location.."}
{"text":"I work in customer service and the guy here should be fired. We ordered pizza and they never delivered it. When I finally called they said it was our first time ordering (not true we have got pizza here many times before) and that they called us to confirm it was a legit order since it was a new customer ordering (also not true we had no missed calls) and we didn't answer they claim, so they canceled the order. Said delivery would take another hour if we wanted to reorder and was extremely rude, smug and unprofessional to my friend and I on the phone when he asked if they would give a discount since we would be waiting 2 1/2 hours for pizza that was supposed to be delivered in 20 mins when it was first ordered. They were super business this night and simply didn't WANT to make the pizzas I believe. Not a good way to keep service or a good rep but from all the negative reviews it seems like this is typical for this location. Corporate needs to step in and clean house of the lazy employees at this location!"}
{"text":"Very impressed with the food from this local pizza place tonight. Ordered two 'Build it Yourself' large pizzas and found a myriad of options available (to my delight). Both pizzas came exactly as requested and can say that the veggie pizza (thin crust flavored with cayenne pepper, mushrooms, spinach, jalapeños and red onions) was one of the best I've had in a long time. My husband said the same thing. Impressed. My son picked up the food which was met with great customer service as well. Way to go Pizza Hut!"}
{"text":"Quick service. Friendly staff. It doesn't get better than this."}
{"text":"New decor work's.  Lunch buffet very busy but bar's remained full at all time's.  Very friendly service."}
{"text":"WARNING!!! Stay clear of this location if you want quality food and service,  they burn the food and ban you from receiving deliveries if you talk back to the driver when he swears at you. Very rude poor service best to find another location or order somewhere else.  Management should be ashamed of the customer relationships and needs to take some courses in Research and Development. THE CUSTOMERS PAY YOUR BILLS GET A CLUE!!!"}

If you do carry-out check your order before you leave."}
{"text":"Never been thrilled with service at this location. We had been ordering here due to close distance to our home but now there is a huge concern of mine and I want someone to contact me about some paedophile who works here called Steve.  As I sent my 16 year old daughter to buy some pizzas and wings and to our surprise she refused to go due to how uncomfortable she feels to come to your location  and have that individual with long hair as described by my daughter look at her  insistently in a very inappropriate way.
Since when Pizza Hut allows their employees to  this disgusting behavior that my daughter refuses to go there anymore?  
I want immediate attention to this concern I find this repulsive and this individual should be terminated. 
I will definitely take this to corporate"}
{"text":"This place is the epitome of bad customer service + health code violation!!!! The first time I went I ordered online which said my order would be ready for pick up in 25 minutes when I showed up they were standing around talking and when I finally got someones attention they told me they hadn't even started making it, so I had to sit there an additional 20 min!!!

The second time my food was ready but some employee with no brain thought it was a good idea to spray the inside of the holding rack windows with windex while mine and others food was inside TWICE!!! When I told the manager her response was \"people make mistakes\" lol wow. She then rudely told me they would replace my order and guess who she picked to make it? Windex lady!!! I will never go to this disgusting place again!! Then again with a 45 year old looking manager that clearly can't even brush her hair ,and other employees bringing out free food to their boyfriends in front of waiting customers I guess my average expectations were just too high"}

It is a good place for pizza hut fans and for a family.
Sometimes the waitress may mistake,so double check for the order with them.

{"text":"Placed an order for two large, pretzel crust (yummy!) pizzas last week during the noon hour.  On-line ordering process was easy, and the 45-minute estimated delivery time was right on.  The driver was courteous, kind, and professional.  Our meals arrived hot, fresh, and delicious.  Will definitely order from this location again!"}
{"text":"Usaully good service but tonight they burnt all the pizza .....then gave a half done pizza ....then ran out of thin crust ! Too much drama in one night....left my family hungry and waiting 1.5 hours for pizza.....really they didn't even comp the meal but rather gave a discount off the next pizza.......not sure if I'll ever be back!"}
{"text":"Champaign-Urbana has some great pizza places so true Pizza Hut can't hold a candle to, say, Papa Dels. But it's cheap and sometimes that's all you need. That and the belief that at least it's better than frozen pizza!

This Pizza Hut has a dine-in section but it seems stuck in a time warp. I prefer instead to order online for take-out. The pizza's ready very quickly, usually within 15 minutes. 

The back of your receipt invites you to fill a short Pizza Hut online survey. If you do that, you get $10 off your next order. With that $10 off $20 coupon, you can order a large specialty pizza with either a side or a dessert. That's enough food for 4 people and costs less than 13 bucks."}
{"text":"As im waiting for my correct order to arrive, im posting about the poor customer service i recieved. This is my first time posting on yelp. 
I ordered a family box. One pizza with pepperoni the other one with cheese and pineapple. Also came with wings and breadsticks. Opened the box, both were pepperoni. 2 of my kids hate pepperoni. Absolutely no marinara for the breadsticks. 
Upon calling, i let them know what had happened. Mind you, im a great tipper. These guys work hard. My bill is always around 25.00. Always give atleast 10.00.
The girl on the phone needed to speak with her mgr. 
Guess how they're making it better???
Need to return one of the pizzas. Is the driver going to dig in the box and pull it out after hes handling money and his steering wheel?
Oh,instead of making new breadsticks, they are bringing marinara for the now cold ones!!
Way to go pizza hut on watson!!
This will be the last time i give you my bussiness.."}
{"text":"I order here when I am to tired to cook haha. I really like how close it is to my house which is a huge push and I never had a bad experience there and I order from here maybe 2 times a month. I like the drivers too they are pretty cool. I just don't understand why there is a delivery fee but that's not the locations fault its corporate."}
{"text":"The mighty have fallen. We haven't been here for at least a year and it will be a long time before we go back. 
The salad bar was ok. Standard but choice of dressings were not that great. And they were scattered in different places.  Not a big deal but out of the ordinary. 
The biggest let down was the Badger Special pizza.  This used to be great with a real good fennel Italian Sausage that had some spice to it. The sausage on this pizza was like cooked links that were so mild and chopped up and didn't have much flavor.  And the mushrooms definitely been around too long. 
So many chains have gone out of business recently like Uno's.  Too bad,  my last visit to Uno's was 10 times better than my visit to this Pizza Hut."}
{"text":"The food here is consistently good with few exceptions.

They have a knack for hiring people that don't have a basic understanding of taking a basic pizza order, but at least the kitchen delivers.  This could be circumvented by placing an order online, if only this location still accepted delivery orders online (carry out only).

This is location has indoor tables to eat at if you want someone else to clean up the mess - just order at the counter and they'll bring the pizza to your table when it's ready."}
{"text":"I placed an order online and it gave me a delivery time for 4:11pm. I looked up and it was 4:27pm and so I called pizza Hut and asked about my order and the girl who answered the phone put me on hold and put the manager Paul on the phone and he told me that the driver was couldn't find my apartment and so they canceled my order without even trying to call me. I then asked him why didn't the driver call me and he said he didn't know. I asked for the corporate number and instead of trying to fix the problem he gave me the number and did not even apologize for the inconvenience. The driver was Rick and trust me I will be calling corporate."}
{"text":"Can't understand the Pizza Hut hype. Placed an order for myself and my toddler. Order was confirmed at 6:40pm...... Pizza showed up at 8:10, lukewarm at best, greasy hand prints on the box, tasted disgusting, and after 3 phonecalls, I got my partial credit. Lesson learned....  Instead of crediting people, work on your pizza making, possibly staff training. 
 And for the excuse from your staff that the \"app and pc don't really communicate\" so times can greatly vary from what your confirmation states..... Get your IT staff looking into this promptly! Poor excuse.

Once bitten, twice shy."}
{"text":"I've been ordering from this location for ~20 years, but lately the service and quality has gone drastically downhill. When they get it right it's good and they get it right. But this is becoming less and less often. This is my first ever yelp post and I only am posting because I'm getting fed up. I never order delivery because even on football weekends they typically have only 1 driver and it takes forever, never when it says. From what I see this problem really started a couple years ago when I started noticing new faces every time I picked up. Ever since there has been zero consistency in the food, more than likely because there is zero consistency in staff! Before there was a manager named John who was on point.

One of the main reasons I keep going back is because my 5 yr old loves their thin and crispy, but I doctor their mistakes before she eats it (too much sauce when I order light sauce, toast it if it's not crispy, etc).

I sincerely hope management sees this and puts some effort in correcting the issues."}

{"text":"I ordered online. I received an email confirmation. After waiting for 20 minutes past our delivery time I finally called. The manager (Caitlin) said that she tried to call and received no answer so cancelled our order. Apparently it's policy to call and confirm the order. That was NOT conveyed when I placed my order. Caitlin (sp?) said she could replace the order and we'd wait another 35 minutes for our food. What's the point of ordering online if not for convenience and expediency. No thanks! I'll pay a few extra bucks and go across the street to My Mother's from now on."}
{"text":"The worst pizza hut I have ever ordered from. For example take tonight, I placed an order at 10:20 and it's 11:48pm. The hour+ wait is fine, since the email confirmation said 11:37, but how much longer do they need to dish out a simple order? Especially on a Wednesday? It doesn't make sense. I have ordered before and the same wait times exist. Additionally, the food usually comes cold--stale bread sticks and stiff pizza. I should have known better than to order from this location again, but pizza hut is one of my most beloved placed to order from. Apparently not snymore."}
{"text":"Amazing... stuff, the customer service couldnt have been better, she made sure my pizza looked prestine, i believe she was a manager, her name was sydney, but i honestly was a dominos guy before i went here, so let her know you guys gained one customer for her efforts lol but quality awesome, pizza looked like a picture"}
{"text":"I mean if you are craving pizza hut specifically, go for it. But if you want a nice pizza...this is not the place to go. Pizza is chalked with salt and the loaded with low quality cheese. Also way more expensive than smaller, nice pizza places."}
{"text":"Last year this place had some issues but they totally redeemed them self.   Order last couple times and pizza was absolutely PERFECT and on time.  Good job guys !!"}
{"text":"Delivery was delivered on time when requested. Delivery man was friendly. Food on the other hand was far from statisfying. Have had better food in the past. Disappointed this time"}
{"text":"Yes, I know it's Pizza Hut, so there was no major expectations. To be fair the pizza was good but the positive experience stopped there. The restaurant was just unsatisfactory. Old, dated and dirty."}
{"text":"We ordered a pizza with half spinach and they forgot to add it. When my sister told them, they took back the pizza and just threw it on the top. My sister, feeling dooped  , asked why they would just throw it on, to which they replied \"that's our policy\". This seemed unlikely...and my sister felt like it was just thrown there so they isnt have to make another. She left with the pizza because anyway because she was in a hurry. She came home and told me the story and I called the manager. Who apologized repeatedly. He defiantly made us feel a lot better about the situation. 
It's not just about customer service...it's about how you handle a customer complaint. Bravo! 5 stars."}
{"text":"Takes a lot longer than Papa Johns, but it is cheaper. To the company: I don't recommend having a countdown if you aren't delivering within that time frame. It's a psychological tip for free, unlike your delivery. Ordered at 2:53pm on a Tuesday. Delivered at 3:51. Had to microwave both mozzarella sticks and pizza since they were apparently sitting around. Delivery driver was polite and friendly."}
{"text":"ordered meat lovers..IT WAS RAW. ... called had it re ordered. ...IT WAS RAW.who want raw pizza dough? ?????"}
{"text":"If I could I would give it zero star's. took an hour and a half for me to get my food that's literally the 4the time. I mean it's such a shame. 
 I have thousands of followers on social media and honestly I wouldn't recommend them ordering from this location."}
{"text":"This is one of the only pizza chains that offers gluten free pizza. And it's the only one that does it right! I especially love this location--the service is very pleasant, on time and their interior isn't small and cramped like a lot of other locations."}
{"text":"Don't even bother ordering online - they will screw up your order each time. Ordered 3 times and each time they were issues: first time, 1.5 hours to get cold pizza. Second time wrong topping pizza arrived. Called to complain and said that's what we ordered ( mind you the email confirmation showed we did not order what they made ); and just yesterday, apparently because I entered a different cell phone than what they had on file ( mind you they had two prior deliveries at my address under same name as this last order), we  were considered \"new customers\" and we're required to verify order over the phone- for the safety of their drivers. Apparently , they called me and it went to voicemail, so they cancelled my order. After waiting 45 minutes with a house full of hungry little kids /play date , I called them to ask about the pizzas - and that's when I found out. Needless to say had to get in the car and do a pickup from nearest other shop .  I won't bother ordering from this shop ever."}
{"text":"I rarely ever write reviews, but needed to share my experience with this location today. 

I've ordered from this location on numerous occasions for delivery and carry out and normally don't have any issues worth mentioning. However, today was different. I used the app to place an order for delivery today around 5pm. The confirmation stated my order should be delivered by 5:40pm. By 6pm, I was still waiting on my delivery. I called the location to check the status and was told the driver left at 5:23 and should be at my place by now or soon. I live very close to this location(4 minute drive according to the Maps App). The delivery guy arrived at 6:10pm with only HALF of my order, which was barely warm at this point. He apologized and said that he would return to the store and have my missing food remade and deliver it fresh, but I never saw him again. I paid for a product that I didn't receive, and the store did not try to correct it. I contacted Pizza Hut's corporate customer service hotline and was only offered vouchers (to be delivered by regular mail) for a free pizza to try to compensate for the error. This was a huge customer service fail. I won't be ordering from this location or possibly any Pizza Hut location anymore."}
{"text":"Excellent Service and Very Clean. Prodessional Staff and an awesome manager! I was not going to leave a review but this place went out of there way to be helpful"}
{"text":"Easy and convenient. The pizza is decent, but the delivery drivers are ALWAYS so nice and pleasant!"}
{"text":"Worst customer service!. The guy taking my order actually took a personal call on his cell phone and had me waiting to place my order."}
{"text":"I love this place. No let me say that again, I LOVE this place. They are always SO fast, everyone is SO NICE. Pizza is piping hot, not to mention fun desserts! Even when they are SLAMMED which is MOST of the time, they never make excuses, they just put on a smile and get the pizzas out the door! I never thought our neighborhood Pizza Hut would be our \"go to\" place for dinner, but as FAST AS THEY ARE! They deliver, before my order is complete!! Thanks Pizza Hut and all the crew working this location. It's a shitty spot but ALL OF YOU MAKE IT WORK! And for that, I just want to say thanks :) we got a pot of gold in the ghetto"}
{"text":"Wow... the young lady that answered the phone on 2/26/17 was unbelievably rude. Waited for 10 minutes for her to answer the phone. She was abrasive and curt. Plus it was 1.5 hours to 2 hours for delivery. We asked for a gluten free pizza and she said she didn't know what gluten free was. I ended up not placing an order for fear she might do something gross to the order. Never again with this location."}
{"text":"This was my worst pizza buying experience ever! A bunch of thug kids run this place. They will mess up your pizza and then refuse to refund your money. I paid cash and they said they had to mail a refund to my home. Needless to say I cut my losses and went to Dominoes."}
{"text":"Terrible customer service. They kept me on hold for 15mins for one call, 10mins for another and 3mins for another. They are rude to customers and don't know how to properly put cheese on the pizza. Most sports are empty with just sauce and the crust is too hard. I will never order from here ever again. Bad management"}
{"text":"I wanted some cheap and greasy tacos.
They provided me with exactly what I wanted. 
My stomach was angry with me for a little bit afterwards, but I would have been more concerned if it wasn't.  
The chick behind the counter was really nice.  I think she was Filipina.  Lovely though."}
{"text":"I owned three pizzeria back east and I know what good pizza tastes like I wanted to try this fast food  of pizza just to see how bad it was and it did live up to my expectations... I felt I was eating a sponge the sauce tasted sour and I think they use that phony baloney plastic cheese... For the life of me I don't know how they stay in business there's just a lot of people out there that do not know what a good pizza taste like"}
{"text":"I have a dairy allergy and so we try to get half the pizza with cheese and half without. In the past we have ordered online and been able to do this without a problem. However, the online interface changed and even though we used a previously saved order our entire pizza was made without cheese (even though my email confirmation  half with cheese and half without). When my husband picked up the pizza and pointed out the issue, he was told to call next time-no attempt to make it right. Disappointed. We will have to drive farther or go somewhere else in the future."}
{"text":"The worst service ever, 3 times in a row its been more than 30 minutes late on top of the 1 hour wait!!"}
{"text":"The worst Pizza Hut place, even the worst pizza place I've ever been. Terrible service, rude staff and horrible baking too. I went there a few times since it's close by. They see you but no one cares until you wait at least 5 minutes! The last time I got my pizza it was half burnt and 3 slices of it had no topping on it!"}
{"text":"The worst pizza place to goto I didn't know a buisness could hire so many high school drop outs, I've ordered from here many times since I used to live down the road, and the amount of times they completely forgot to deliver my pizza or they would bring the wrong pizza is baffling"}
{"text":"I am in LA and just tried to order a pizza for my boyfriend who is at a hotel on the strip. The delivery guy calls me and says he's five minutes away...ok great. Then he calls me again to inform me that he is downstairs. Ok...I call him back and apparently he expects my boyfriend  to go downstairs to pick up the pizza....he refuses to bring it to my room!! WTF?? Alex-0, Juan-1"}
{"text":"I wish I could give it no stars. 
Orders wrong and creepy delivery guy. 
Substitute your food for like items when they run out of things. Then tell you as they deliver. 
Will never go there again.
Wouldnt recommend to starving children.

As an added bonus, this fine establishment put jalapeños under each slice of my sausage and pepperoni."}
{"text":"We attempted to dine in. Unfortunately the lady working inside said she was too busy to serve us. We were the only people in the building with the exception of her. Completely unacceptable and she was very rude. Will never again go to this location."}
{"text":"Really hard to rate food considering our pizza never made it to our table. On a Thursday night entered an almost empty restaurant, just a couple of teenagers finishing up. Placed our order at 7:40p (2 pepperoni pizzas), another family arrives 15 mins later places an order and receives their pizza. I finally get the attention of the waitress who seems to be avoiding our area and tells me 5-7 min more. That time passes and we're at 45 min without food and no response other than they had a lot of box orders to fill. What? Then how did the other family get their order and finish by 8:30? We finally talk to the manager, basically a kid without a clue. We leave after an hour without eating and rejecting a $15 off coupon to a restaurant where we can't get served."}
{"text":"I've ordered from this place many times, usually as a delivery. They make the order very quickly, and rarely mess it up. I have went in store to pick up the order couple times and there was one older guy there with a very bad attitude and would constantly cut me off whilst i'm talking. If it weren't for that guy and the prices this place would get 5/5 from me."}
{"text":"the pizza here is great but whats up with the service, always waiting more than what they tell you and you wait 10 mins on the phone for someone to answer  ,  what the heck is up with this place, maybe hire some more people or something."}
{"text":"What happened to Pizza Hut wings? Back in the day they used to oven bake their wings, now pizza hut deep fries them. Big mistake, but pizza is still good."}
{"text":"I order from this Pizza Hut every single week. For the past two weeks, the driver has had to call me because he has no idea where they're going AND my order has been wrong!! I get it being busy and that there are new drivers, but come on! If it's happened to me two weeks in a row, how many people deal with it usually. I didn't get my Asiago crust and THATS THE BEST PART!!!"}
{"text":"I don't know about ANY other locations because I NEVER order pizza from any of the commercial franchise operations, however, the quality and service I receive here is tops! I originally ordered from here due to being too lazy to get off my butt and go to my regular pizza haunt and was just amazed at what I got and have been a fan since! Hand-tossed crust is a must, along with the premium tomato sauce. The 2 medium, unlimited topping deal for $6.99 each is a great value. 3 thumbs up! Keep up the good work and thanks!"}
{"text":"In my years of ordering pizza from Pizza Hut, have I ever experienced such horrible service. I ordered my pizza over the phone with a crew member who had such bad attitude and was so impatient with me. Now I understand when things are being rushed people get a little upset but this guy was something else. The worst part of it all was when I called them while I was waiting for my pizza for AN HOUR AND 40 MINUTES and the lady who answered gave me an even worse attitude after I told her that if my pizza was cold I wasn't going to accepted it and she said with an attitude \"ok that's fine\" like really? And when the pizza delivery guy arrived almost near midnight after me ordering my pizza at 9pm he hands me a cold pizza, cold pasta and bread sticks I didn't even order. Never will I order from Pizza Hut again. A waste of money."}
{"text":"Went in to place a carryout order for one large pizza. Person after person walked in complaining about under cooked pizza and the manager had to give them refunds and recook them. A family sat down in the dining room and no one came to their table to take their order so they placed one to go. I would have just walked out. Then another guy came in to pick up his order but they lost it so it caused another scene. There seemed to only be a manager, cook and order taker named Sean working. Sean seemed very overwhelmed and needed more help. He was flustered, short with the customers and practically threw the receipt at me. I've never been to a Pizza Hut this chaotic."}
{"text":"DO NOT EAT HERE! Just went here with my family and walked into complete filth. Every table was dirty and there was only one other family dining. The employee cleared off a table and wiped it down with a wet paper napkin. Some lady took our order then proceeded to tell us that she didnt even work there she was just helping her friend (totally weird).pizza came out with missing toppings. He forgot our wings.  I asked for maranara and he told me they didnt have any. It was a total waste of $$."}
{"text":"Terrible customer service. The woman at the cash register is rude and unpleasant. She became upset when I inquired about the discount? I recommend going somewhere else. It's not worth the experience."}
{"text":"I ordered a pizza last night. While it was delicious and made me feel guilty about my diet, I was disappointed with the customer service.  I specifically asked them in the special instructions to draw a bear on my pizza box. Got the pizza and guess what? No bear! It plainly read in giant letters on the receipt, \"DRAW A BEAR ON THE PIZZA BOX\". What kind of bull shit is that?

Oh and the pasta tasted like it was made with rotten milk. The pizza was great."}
{"text":"My Food always comes warm/cold something always wrong with my order every time , Pizza Hut is about 10mins away , I don't understand why my food comes cold , cause of this place I never want to eat pizza hit again !!!! And they get mad when u call and complain"}
{"text":"Good restaurant. I come here once every few months and the service is good. I mostly go during lunch time so there is a buffet as well, but i always take menus so i don't know how good the buffet is.  There's usually only 1 waiter doing everything so she's not cheery all the time but she's still quite friendly.  I don't have to wait for the food too long, by the time i'm done with my garlic bread, my pizza arrives :)."}
{"text":"Pizza is basic, a little overpriced imo. Don't get the wings, mine were raw, cheesy bread was pretty good actually. The place needs a revamp."}
{"text":"What is up with the pigeon wings. I order some (16)wings from them on wed night along w pasta & pizza &a the cookie pie. Everything was okay but the wing were so small. I stopped on on Thur & spoke to a manger & showed him the pictures of them. He stated that I would have to call the general manger about them. 
Really, he could of offered to remake me some wings. & that would have been fine but now I need to call someone else. Wow what happen to good customer service. I know that it wasn't his fault but he could have made it right. Instead I need to go talk w someone else. Hope you all fix this."}
{"text":"This one sucks! Was staying at the Hilton, ordered a pizza said it would be here about 11pm, showed up at 11:30pm (I ordered it at 10:20pm) and the pizza was room temp!!!! Called manager, he offered a credit for another medium pizza.  Ok, was somewhat satisfied. But then when I called on Sunday to claim my pizza that was owed to me, the girl on the phone said it would be a little over an hour for delivery!!! What the hell is the point? Are they that short staffed for an entire weekend?!? Bad business."}
{"text":"Fast delivery and great specials are 2 reasons to order this when you don't feel like cooking and are not in the mood to ,eave the house."}
{"text":"I grew up in small town in Texas where we had 2 dine in Pizza-Huts. They were always great. I even had one of my b-day parties at one of them as it had an arcade section in it. I think it was my 12th or 13th year b-day. Pizza and arcade games, what else could a young guy want at that age right. 

Anyways, I am much older now of course and although prefer to support the local Pizza places, I still on occasion order from Pizza hut and the likes. I had not seen a dine-in Pizza hut in Phoenix in the longest time. So when I drove by this one, I made note to stop by in the next time the mood for Pizza would strike.  So visited this dine-in Pizza hut yesterday.

Although our waitress was nice, she wiped off our table from whoever ate before us with just a wet paper towel, rather than with something that would sanitize the table. The crumbs she wiped off went onto the carpet/floor and left them there. There were only 2 other parties at the time, yet the all the remaining booths hadn't been cleaned and the menus were sticky. 

The restroom was a bit unkept, by this I mean there was urine left from whoever used it prior and a dirty toilet brush with no holder towards one corner. I did like the self shutting off faucets, they save on water, however I would prefer if both the faucets and soap dispenser were on sensors. 

It is clear that this dine in is in need of repairs as the booth seats were deeply torn, almost like they had been slashed open. 

On the bright bright side the pizza that we ordered was good, hopefully the kitchen does a better job cleaning."}
{"text":"I gave this place another chance since I heard it was under new management. Unfortunately, I am still disappointed. When I got the pizza home, it was a BBQ lovers, my husband and I were extremely upset to find there was a significant lack of cheese on the pizza. What little cheese there was wasn't melted at all. The edge of the crust was burnt and the middle was soggy. There was a ridiculous amount of sauce which doesn't make sense at all given how little cheese there was.  Will not be returning. For real this time."}
{"text":"The pizza was good can't complain of anything we ordered. But it felt like we were in a refrigerator. I know it's Phoenix and it's hot but today's it's only 84 and I've worked in a pizzeria before but everyone in the restaurant was shivering. We just wanted to eat so fast and get out we didn't enjoy our meal."}
{"text":"I must admit, my experience at this location was the absolute worst restaurant experience of my life. I arrived there with 3 of my friends on a Sunday at 6pm, I found it odd that even though the restaurant has approximately 40 tables or so, there were only 2 other tables that were occupied. We all placed our order, 1 of my friends ordered the exact same thing as myself. About 35 minutes later (which is ridiculous for pizza and wings) all 3 of my friends got their order (which was under cooked), I was told mine would be 5 minutes more. I waited 15 minutes (Total 50min after ordering) and asked the waitress again, she told me that what had happened was my order was \"accidentally sent out for delivery\" She said she didn't know why the manager didn't just make a new order, and that it would be ANOTHER 5 min. I told her to send the manager to my table because I want to talk to him since this was unacceptable; I did not come out to a restaurant with my friends to watch them eat, I came to eat WITH them and they were already finished at this point. The manager NEVER came. About 5 min later I noticed one of their delivery drivers returning with what looked like a personal pizza and a box of wings (which is what I ordered). Ironically, my order was ready exactly 2 minutes after their driver returned with it, in other words, the manager at this location believes in recycling food - It was clear as day that they just took the cold, touched food that was sent out for delivery and picked up again, and just re-heated it to serve to me. This is both DISGUSTING as well as illegal. I refused the order (which arrived 65min after ordering), and demanded the manager WHO NEVER CAME. I went to the front to ask for him and I was told he was now unavailable. This location is the ABSOLUTE WORST place I've been to, and being a Montreal native means I've tried many, many establishments. I have not been to a Pizza hut in 10 years prior to this, and I can honestly say that I never will be back. I will be reporting their \"food recycling\" to both the better business bureau of Quebec and the Canadian Food Inspection Agency. Oh yeah, and as compensation for leaving me to starve and literally ruin my Sunday, the offered me a 10 percent off card. What a bunch of retards."}
{"text":"They have messed up our pizza 3 of the 4 times we have ordered delivery.  Twice the pizza was cold and the wings had no sauce on them.  I am all for giving a place several tries, however, this is a chain pizza place.  Y'all should have your stuff together by now.   Sorry.  But we are done ordering from this Pizza Hut."}
{"text":"I don't expect a whole lot from a Pizza Hut--but somehow this place has managed to fall woefully short of even my really really low expectations.

I ordered a large double pepperoni extra cheese.  I got...I dunno, I guess it was a large, so that's good.  The toppings were easily 2\" in from the edge of the crust, enough to see the exposed punching on the surface of the dough.  There was barely enough cheese to qualify as 'regular,' and the thing was overbaked to hell.  I also noticed a sign on the oven admonishing the store employees that \"food costs are through the roof these days\" --obviously  they are cutting some corners here.  

For this privilege I paid like fifteen bucks.  I'll just go to the Little Caesars and pay six bucks for more pizza that manages to not be complete crap.  Or order from another location."}
{"text":"**LAME CUSTOMER SERVICE**
So I just got off the phone with this location about my online order and them not being able to fill my order because they were all \"Out\" of the personal pan pizza dough/crust. In actuality it was because this was a promotion of 50% off regular priced pizza ordered online which brought my regular order of 3 pizzas to $9.34 after tax and delivery. Now since they were \"Out\" of this dough/crust they could change the dough/crust in the system and it would only change to $25.64 before delivery and taxes. So instead of making things right and offering to give me my order at the discounted price with the other crust I was told all they could do was change the crust in the computer, but I would have to pay the difference. 
My question is how in the heck does a pizza location go out of its most popular dough knowing they have this promotion? Answer: They don't. They just try to bully you into paying more for a \"different\" crust. How do I know..I just called them again to place an order over the phone for the same thing and it wasn't a problem because they could charge me regular price since it wasn't an online special promotion. Funny how the dough/crust is now available."}
{"text":"Disappointing experience tonight.  Called Pizza Hut in Stow to place an order for 7 hungry girls.  Wanted to get the special that was offered in the Red Plum flyer that comes to the house.  The guy who answered the phone said they didn't know about that special and he offered something different.  20 minutes later, my husband goes to pick up the pizzas -- no order -- no record of the order.  And, yes they do have the special offered in Red Plum.  Apparently when the phones get busy, calls get re-routed to a call center -- and therein lies the problem..  Talked to the manager on location in Stow -- said he'd deal with the call center issue -- but nothing offered as compensation for my husband standing there on a Friday night waiting for his pizzas to be baked.  Not happy."}
{"text":"UPDATE +1

Alright, ordered again and once again the delivery guy was very nice. This time the order was perfect. The \"delivery time\" was off but I'm not downgrading since the online order said \"25 minute delivery\". I won't fault the driver for taking 40 minutes to get to my place when it's 5:15PM.. I get it, he probably had 18,000 pizza's in his car to deliver.

If it keeps up, I'll update to 4 stars. Then to 5 since my biggest gripe with previous Pizza Huts has been the staff. At this place, they have been WAY more than kind."}
{"text":"I have been to them before and it was good. I decided to try one today and it was the worst pizza i have ever had, it was doughy and soggy from the amount of grease that was on it. Completely turned me off."}
{"text":"Order always great on carryout .. delivery great .. food always on point Delicious"}
{"text":"Nice guy who gave me my order  and extra pepper.. ordered online was ready when i got there .. barvo"}
{"text":"I normally order from this pizza hut and the food is pretty good. Feb 25th 2017 I did an online order for their pizza dinner box which comes with a square pizza, after waiting almost 2 hrs for my food to be delivered I received a pizza that was so cold that the cheese was hard and to top it off they gave me a round pizza rather than the square pizza that I ordered. I also ordered a 2 liter of mt.dew that was warm like it had been sitting out. I called to complain about my order which was $25 and I received a credit of $18!?! How do I get penalized for your mess up?? Then I call today to  order my kids pizza once again and after ordering I'm told my wait will be 2 hours 30 mins really pizza hut!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I've literally never had a worse pizza in my life... the veggies were so dried out that they were actually chewy... like chewing bad jerky kinda chewy. Thinnest crust I've ever seen on a regular pizza. Both pizzas were supposed to be stuffed crust but were both hollow inside. We were quoted 30 minutes but it took over an hour. I've literally never had a good pizza from this location, but never anything this bad. We usually opt to drive to the rainbow location rather than order delivery from this one. They are literally always out of whatever the special pizza that's being advertised is and the quality is horrible. 
There are too many pizza options in this part of town to order from this location. We used to order pizza hut weekly before we moved to this house and now don't just because the Flamingo store is the only one we can order from.
Yay another long rant on Yelp. Not bashing pizza Hut, because it's become my favorite, but I won't order from this location again."}
{"text":"Absolutely disgusting. Pizza was cold (pick up). Cheesy sticks were cold and terrible. I would avoid this particular location at all costs."}
{"text":"Spots missing cheese - Crust not all the way cooked. :("}
{"text":"The bread sticks are good. The pasta is disgusting. It came out very overcooked. The noodles were so mushy and disgusting it was almost liquid and I'm pretty sure the chicken is not actually chicken. And apparently you don't get marinara sauce with your bread sticks. Who doesn't dip bread sticks in sauce? At least if you don't give one out with our order let us know while purchasing that its extra if wed like marinara which I'm guessing most people do when they order bread sticks.  Terrible customer service. The girl was talking on her cell phone the entire time she put my bread sticks together no wonder the pasta was over cooked and cold. 2 thumbs down for this location. Pizza hut is normally very good."}
{"text":"Justin was our delivery driver and he is fantastic! Such a pleasant employee and works hard! He seems to work quite often and is always a pleasure to be greeted by! The pizza is always hot and delicious!"}
{"text":"The food could be fresher and the service could be a little bit better. Overall it was okay."}
{"text":"Ordered on the phone went in to receive my pizza, they messed mine up with someone else's but I was cool about it and so was the guy. He was nice about it and gave me a free soda for the confusion. But I walked in to great smiles and all the employees where happy like one big family."}
{"text":"Brutal! As in, really, really brutal. We have really liked Pizza Hut in the past (in Calgary) and unfortunately for us and the rest of Airdrie, this location is awful! 

We have ordered from here about once every 8 months hoping and wishing and praying they get their sh#& together and it doesn't seem to ever happen. Tonight was the last time. 

Pizza shows up cold, under-done, raw and with little to no sauce. Delivery charges are unreasonable and the price is always double as advertised for some strange reason. 

Funny... is used to say \"Satisfaction Guarenteed\" on the box (we have called in the past to complain, with absolutely no resolution) and now it no longer says that. Hmmmm, wonder why? 

This business is out of chances with us. Period. Please don't waste your money!"}
{"text":"I was so disappointed with this thin crust veggie lovers pizza tonight. It took 55 minutes to be delivered, and the crust was so hard and my pizza was cold. Pizza Hut is my only pizza restaurant that I order pizza from. This was my first time ordering the thin crust pizza and it will be my last time ordering it. I will stick to my original hand tossed pizza. And if I call in for delivery and it takes several calls before I am able to place my order, I will not order at all. Maybe because it was so busy, that is the reason why it took so long to place an order and the reason why my pizza was cold."}
{"text":"I ordered two large pizzas for Pick-Up. When I got there the pizzas were just coming out of the oven. I had 6 hungry young girls and was very glad that they did not have to wait. Quick service and friendly staff. Only one suggestion-local advertisements."}
{"text":"Ordered the big box pizza online.  It arrived 15 minutes late and the entire order was cold.  The wings are a disgusting mess of garbage.  If I fed these wings to my dog, PETA might intervene."}
{"text":"I always order stuffed crust from this location and usually it's decent Pizza... This time however it was not. The pizza was so greasy it was soggy in the center and every slice I pulled off only half of it would come the other half would say in the Box. To make matters worse I decided to give a courtesy call to the manager in charge and let them know that the pizza was overly greasy causing my pizza to fall apart and taste disgusting. I didnt want any compensation I just wanted to let them know and I expected an apology considering I just wasted $20 on their nasty pizza. However I did not receive an apology or anything of the sort. It's unbelievable I didn't ask for any compensation at all and all I wanted was an apology yet I failed to receive the apology I was deserved. Disappointing customer service to say the least I will never order Pizza Hut again I'll stick to Papa John's."}
{"text":"this pizza hut has the nicest worker who has ever worked at pizza hut. his name is fred and he is awesome. he is usually working at the counter when i pick up my food.

everything else is pretty much what you expect from pizza hut in general."}
{"text":"This is the absolute worse Pizza Hut ive ever encountered. The staff and manager are not customer service oriented and seem very stressed. In this area they never deliver and when they do it is a 3 hour delay. News Flash, we live in Cleveland and the weather conditions are never favorable. If other business can operate and satisfy their customers there is no reason why this location cant. I would recommend that they replace or train their management staff again to implement a higher degree of customer service at all times. I would not be surprised if this location shuts down. I now settle for papa johns in the same location because they know how to satisfy their customers."}
{"text":"Absolutely terrible customer service. The manager named Sharon was incredibly rude on the phone, interrupting me constantly while insinuating I was to dumb to know what a cheese pizza should look like. Also indirectly accused me of trying to scam her for a free pizza and told me if I didn't like it to bring the one I had back to the store and that I could have another. I will never order from here again."}
{"text":"I've been going to this place for almost two years and have always enjoyed the deep dish veggie pizza. Until recently when I ordered wings with my pizza. I got 14 wings and was picking at one wing and thought it was a little pink. To my surprise it was raw! And so were more than half of the 14 I ordered. I did call the restaurant right away and was offered a refund/credit etc... However I did not want any of it as I just wanted them to realize this is a very bad situation which could result in food poisoning! I am really hoping it doesn't as I don't wish to see that food ever again."}

{"text":"Recently ordered 2 wing deal specials was satisfied with  the price for the most part lil steep but I guess not for delivery they did how ever not deliver in the specific time that was instructed n my boxes were wrapped n crumbled like garbage n I was missing a bonless chicken just one I counted the rest was satisfied with food why I give this rating"}
{"text":"Pizza Hut is no longer in business at this location, it has been gone for many years."}
{"text":"I guess I will never visit this store.  Ordered food for carry out.   Had a gift card with receipt that friends sent to help with my accident recovery.   They said the card was invalid and wanted my wife to pay.  Customer service.   What a joke.  There is much better pizza in the area anyway."}
{"text":"I enjoy pizza. I enjoy many restaurants that serve pizza. The Pizza Hut on 16th at and Thomas is one of those restaurants. The staff is nice, prompt, and helpful in their explanations. Disclaimer: I have tried about four variations of three basic pizzas. I have enjoyed them all. I cannot speak for other items offered by Pizza Hut, but I'm sure the staff at this location will ensure all wings and brownies meet their full potential. Keep up the good work."}
{"text":"Literally the worst service I've ever received, and I have shopped at Best Buy.  Placed an order online and received email confirmation that my order would be delivered at 2PM.  I ordered my pizza at 1PM, but thought, OK it's a busy time.  It got to be 2:30PM, so I called them to get a status on my order.  They said that they did not ever place the order because our they called to confirm it was a safe address twice.  1 - They only called once from a random number and did NOT leave a voicemail.  2 - I received a coonfirmation email saying my order was placed.  The manager was EXTREMELY rude, did not apologize, and did not do anything to right the situation.  I will NEVER be ordering from this place again, regardless of the convenience factor.  I would advise everyone else to do the same.  Dominos is right down the street - GO THERE!"}
{"text":"Pizza is good, but the delivery guy throws trash in driveway while leaving.  
$17 cost of pizza + $5 tip."}
{"text":"I am normally a very accepting person. If mistakes are made, I will over look them. But this was unacceptable. I ordered a large pizza, a pasta, breadsticks and a root beer. What I got, over an hour and a half later, was the wrong pizza, bone cold pasta, breadsticks without sauce, and a Pepsi , which is just motor oil with sugar, ( the driver said they were out of my soda, but they could have atleast called and asked what I wanted instead of root beer), dropped off by an incredibly rude driver. The fact that they tried to charge me for this I take as an insult. I will never be using this Pizza Hut again, Pizza Hut in general is questionable. For those of you who care about food, I would recommend AGAINST this establishment. For somebody who normally smiles at others mistakes, this was unbelievable. At least the manager had the common sense to give me back my money. Besides that small bit of decency, I would have given this place a zero or negative one, if that were even possible. I've learned my lesson, I hope you can learn from me."}
{"text":"This place is consistently late on delivery.  What kind of shit show are they running?  Stay away"}
{"text":"I ordered delivery here with my fiancé... when I opened the box I noticed the smell was off but thought maybe I was just being weird... tried to take a bite but it was disgusting, it almost tasted coppery to me. My fiancé said it smelled like sewage... like there were some serious health code violations happening with the cheese. When we called to complain we were told we had to bring the pizza in so we could prove to them that there was something wrong with it, totally defeating the purpose of delivery. I will not be ordering from here again. It is completely unacceptable to serve food like that; there is no way it should have gone unnoticed. And then to make us bring it back? Just ridiculous. In all fairness, they did refund us after we brought it back, but claimed they \"didn't think it smelled off.\""}
{"text":"I hardly write reviews but this Pizza Hut was so terrible that I had too. Last night placed an order at about 10:30 pm for delivery but I never received it. I called them up several times but no one picked up. They charged my card as well for something which I never received. When I called up the store they say that the driver wasn't there so we cancelled your order. I was not notified at all about this. There was no apology but rather very rude. Now it will take about 4 to 5 business days to get my refund for the order which I never received. Please don't make the mistake of ordering from here unless you want to sleep starving."}
{"text":"We ordered 1 pizza and wings we quoted a time of 40-50 mins. We placed the order at 7:45pm. The website stated that the pizza was on the way some time afterwards. 15 mins after the expected delivery time we called the restaurant and were told that the order was in fact not on the way and was sitting in the hot box. The lady who answered the phone then stated she had no idea how long it would take as she did not know where her delivery driver was.  So one the order was falsely stated as \"on the way\" when it clearly wasn't and 2.  The order has been sitting for well over 30 mins and who know how much longer it will be before we even get it as it's now approaching and hour and half since we ordered and still no word. Needless to say TERRIBLE EXPERIENCE!!"}

{"text":"The food is good, however, they CONSTANTLY forget items ordered and have even delivered me the wrong pizza once. I just ordered a pizza and paid for a few sides which are .50 each and they forgot all of them. A little irked about that. I think I'm going to have to start ordering from another place."}
{"text":"I Went to this place many times and always been served by one older man who always comes off rude towards customers and staff which i i find really un professional. But there is a girl her name is Rena and her customer service is outstanding she always goes out of her way especially with updating me on my pizza and letting me know when it is finished and letting me know it is ready so i don't get it cold, she offers suggestions and always has a smile on her face which keeps me a happy customer. Another girl hardona is very friendly and makes suggestions always. Love their service! Happy customer and they keep me returning :)"}

{"text":"Took an hour to get one pizza!! Rude staff  n I wasnt the only one that was told 10 more min and waited 30"}
{"text":"This place gets one star because a) I can't give it 0 and b) I think the people that were running it just don't know better. As they say in the South, God Bless their hearts. Even Pizza Hut Canada is unresponsive to consumers. So maybe it is a top down training issue?

We ordered online and were told via email and website, pick up time at 4 p.m. We arrived at about 4:03.
We were the only ones in this storefront pick up only location. One person taking an order on the phone. Took until 4:12 until someone acknowledged us. 

Took another TEN minutes to get our pizza. We watched as they came out one at a time to be cut and boxed. Buy the time we got them, the first two were tepid at best. Terrible.

I filled in a online form as I was directed to, and still have had no one contact me.  I tweeted out my complaint, they responded with an automated response, which went nowhere.

We may not always do things right, but we can always do the right thing. Pizza Hut (store and company) choose to not do the right thing. 

There is too many other options for my dining out dollar to give this franchise any more of our business."}
{"text":"I ordered pizza and asked for marinara sauce for my pregnant daughter and was told it would be an extra fee and i agreed that was okay. When the delivery guy arrived with the pizza there was no Marinara sauce and was told to call the store for someone to bring it. When I called and explained that the sauce wasn't delivered with the pizza the guy laughed and said i wasn't charged and no one was going to bring the sauce and when I asked for the manager, I was placed on hold for 15 mins. 

I called back spoke with the Manager and was told the same thing. I then stated if I came to pick up sauce that I would be returning the pizza and expecting a refund he said that's fine and hung up the phone. When me and my husband got to the store the managers attitude was worst he was very nasty and short  stating he didn't think it was necessary to bring the sauce if it i wasn't charged for it he extended no apology or showed any signs of concerned for the matter. I guess customer satisfaction means nothing to this business.

Never order from Pizza Hut on Milton rd! Two after my 1st complaint and the service is still horrible! That's what I get for giving this place a 2nd chance bad service never changes......"}
{"text":"My pizza was just right! Pan tossed, original sauce, cheese, black olives, and red onion. It was done on time and ready for pick up. I had to wait a little bit for someone to come from the back, but it wasn't really a problem, I will order from here in the future."}
{"text":"5-26-16 my online pick up time for my order was 8:19. I didn't walk out of there until 8:54. Half my order was cold, the team there had no clue what was going on. I'm going to Marco's pizza next time. Their phone survey just made it worse..."}
{"text":"Garbage pizza. Any other pizza shop, including other pizza chains make a better pie. Do yourself a favor and find a pop and pop pizza shot. Avoid this greasy pre-made crap."}
{"text":"The pizza is always ready when they say it will be its awesome to be able to rely on people!"}
{"text":"We used to order from PH (this location) all the time. Loved their pizza. About  9 months ago, they started messing up orders a lot.  Last time we ordered they forgot the crust flavoring AND one of our pizzas, requiring another trip to pick it up . . . but when we got there they had mistakenly sent it out to be delivered to someone else.  (So they messed up the other person's order too).  No apology.  So I sent an email to complain, got coupons for 2 free pizzas, but we were pretty much done with them.  Eight months later I come across the coupon and we give them another try.  This time everything was PERFECT!  Pizzas were picture perfect and tasted great!  Hopefully they'll keep up the good work, and we'll be ordering regularly again."}
{"text":"The worst run restaurant I have ever seen. It seems like every second order is screwed up, and the staff couldn't care less."}
{"text":"Terrible service, rude management, waited over 2+ hours for delivery and when I called they were unable to give me an estimate other than \"your food is on the way\".  Was actually hollered at by the manager.  It was a bad night on the roads, I understood, I just needed to know how much longer the wait was going to be.  After I attempted to speak to a district manager I ended up cancelling the order, which the driver delivered anyway.  Won't order from there angain."}
{"text":"Disgusted!!.  Ordered a simple veggie pizza (stuffed crust)with  crispy chicken wings. Took 1h10min for delivery  and I live 15 minutes away. Pizza was so cold that the cheese in the crust was rigid and the chicken wings were floating in the dipping sauce. ( WHO PUTS CHICKEN WINGS IN DIPPIN SAUCE FOR DELIVARY? ) The sauce should be separate  . Long story short . Got a 10 $ credit . Like I want to eat there again. For 36$ I could have bought a huge meal at pizza pizza.  And enjoyed it."}

{"text":"Jeff and Jess ( beautiful smile) took good care of me on Wing Wednesday,  go here for a great deal on wings,"}
{"text":"Yes, this is a Pizza Hut.. that does not give excuse for poor customer service. 

They are usually OK if you order for pickup.. I've had a couple hiccups, but nothing dramatic. However, if you're seeking delivery look elsewhere. 

I wish I could say there has been at least once there was no issue. Today I'm done with them!! I'm done even ordering for pickup.  

That means not only does this location lose my business, but Pizza Hut in general. The next most convenient places we enjoy would be Jets Pizza (always great delivery service) and Little Caesars. 

Today they sent the delivery man with ONLY the wings.. 3 pizzas, breadsticks and cinnamon sticks missing. I politely called to verify they would make sure my pizzas were fresh and SEND NEW WINGS. I was assured the pizzas just came out of the oven and it was simple miscommunication. 

That couldn't be further from the truth. They told the delivery guy I said I DIDN'T WANT fresh wings and sent my order out the door. And it showed up too gummy and lukewarm to be fresh. Mushrooms don't lie!

STILL.. I do have to admit, this isn't as bad as the time a delivery guy went missing with my order. That time, I had to pick up my own order 3 hours late AND the store didn't refund anything. Even the delivery fee. Nor did they offer compensation of any kind. 

Honestly, I may not have even left this review if the general manager had returned my phone call in an appropriate amount of time. I really prefer to handle things more discreetly"}
{"text":"So so to be honest but I am occasionally a sucker for their lunchtime buffet when I really feel like cheesing out.  I always regret it in tears on the drive home :("}
{"text":"I won't order from here again. My delivery consisted of a dried and shriveled and definitely overlooked pizza, along with burned and crunchy cinnamon sticks. What a ripoff."}
{"text":"A lot Better than other CiCi's in Charlotte. It's clean, friendly staff, the pizza was hot and very tasty. The bathrooms were on the dirty side but the staff was very busy keeping up with all the customers. I would come back to this location."}
{"text":"If I could give less of a star I would, the MANAGER named Logan was so rude I can't even begin to believe. Never once made eye contact or said hello. She was too busy talking and laughing with co workers, that's completely rude of somebody especially a manager.. I will not return to this location."}
{"text":"Went to this Pizza Hut because it was the closest to my home. I arrived about 20 minutes after placing my order online. I was greeted by a man whom I think was a delivery driver. He asked to help me, I gave my name and order, he rang me up and took my money, stating it would be a few minutes. About five minutes later he came out and informed me that my pizza was \"screwed up\" and they are making me a new one. Meanwhile a young lady was dealing with another customer who refused his pizza, claiming the cheese was burned, she made him  a new pizza, which he also refused, saying it was burned as well. So she gave him a refund and both \"burned pizzas\". When my pizza came out it barely had any sauce on it, the sauce that was there was about 3 inches from the edge of the crust with the cheese about 4 inches from the edge, it was also very sparse. The crust was very light and seemed under-cooked.

Now, I applaud this young lady for staying cool under pressure in dealing with the other customer, however, my pizza was awful, it was under-cooked and had sparse sauce and cheese. It was dry, hard and had very little flavor. I threw it all away when I got home. 

I gave one star simply for the young lady's patience. 

I will never order another pizza from this Pizza Hut location again."}
{"text":"Rumors are true :-( 

Horrible experience at Ajax location... Worse experience in my life at pizza restaurant...

I took my parents there expecting to have a good time, but it was the opposite..!!! Starting with the drinks, NO orange pop at that place, then when i finally order we had to wait for about 40 mins to get the horrible cooked pizza..!!!

Pizza wasn't even cook properly... Overcooked in the bottom and seems the stove is not getting the pizza cook in the inside... Awful experience...

At the moment to deliver the pizza on our table, i immediately order the bill... 1 large pizza, 1 medium pizza and 4 drinks for 42 bucks... The price It sounds like right to me... But experience was horrible..!!

Carpet dirty.. Not hot sauce on the table unless you want to pay extra... Employes only go to your table when you order and when you ask for the bill... They are more busy talking among them than attend the customers...

Anyway, after eat that pizza... Told my patents to wait for me at the car while i pay the bill... Of course.. NO TIP was given... 

I don't think i will return there any more... But hey... Now i know! Otherwise i can die wonder if YELP reviews were right.... Right..??

Please, visit PINO PIZZA instead... Pino pizza is WAY, but WAY better pizza that crappy pizza hut..."}

{"text":"I ordered 1 large stuffed crust pizza. The cheese was cooked out of the crust, there was hardly any toppings (including cheese), it was cold and it was $20.00! Their large is more comparable to their competitors medium sized pizzas. Absolutely HORRIBLE! for the same or less, go to Barro's or Costco and buy a pizza. You get twice as much and it is made fresh. I wish there were less stars to rate them with."}
{"text":"Good pizza, quick delivery. People it's pizza it takes time to cook and the drivers don't get all the green lights on the way to your home, stop complaining and being lazy, try making your own pizza. If you want fast food try McDonald's. Is my pizza late sometimes yes but it's still warm.  Thank you Pizza Hut you guys rock"}
{"text":"The general manager contacted me via phone and corrected the issue. My money was credited back to my CC."}
{"text":"Pizza Hut is terrible!

I'll never pay for Pizza Hut ever again.  I'll eat it only if it's free, but I won't be very happy about it.

I tried their \"Pizza Mia\" in March, and it was horrible.  I got it because it was $5.  Big mistake.
I've never had such a bad pizza in my life.  The cheese was bad, the sauce was bad, the crust was bad, and the pepperoni was bad.  How does that all come out so horrible?

I'm not one to complain, but it was so bad that I went on their website to let them know.  I didn't know if maybe some of the equipment was dirty?  I don't know.  

ok, so I forgot all about it, and kind of just let it go.  Then just last weekend I ordered a different pizza because they were on sale.
Big mistake!
I was having problems with their website cause it's the worst, and the kid on the phone saw my info and had seen that i had complained MONTHS ago, and they NEVER even got back to me!  WTS?

So he at least apologized and said someone would call me.
A lady did, and she was horrible with the customer service.
She never once apologized that it took 10 months to get back to me!
She didn't even sound shocked that I didn't like their pizza, she said that the Mia pizzas are their \"value line pizzas, using lesser quality ingredients\"
No joke, her exact words.

Even the new pizza I ordered wasn't good, but I didn't even bother to bring it up to her.  She said thanks for my imput and that was the end of the call.  Lame.

I thought that I always liked Pizza Hut in the past, nothing sticks out as having bad experiences, but these last few times have ruined it for me.  There are too many other pizza places out there.  I'm not falling for Pizza Hut's cheap prices anymore.
I guess you get what you pay for.

This Yelp thing won't let me give zero stars, so I HAD to give one."}
{"text":"I responded with 2 stars as Yelp defines 2 stars as \"Meh. I've experienced better.\"
Tonight we ordered pizza, wing and the new Waffle Fries. While ordering online I read about their new product, the Waffle Fries, and when it mentioned how good they are and better than others, I chose to purchase them. After order was placed I walked my dog and later received a nice call from an unknown number. I was awaiting delivery so thought it was the actual driver. After I was disconnected, I called that number back and he called me from what was his personal phone. He said he was the manager, was very nice, and asked for the Unit Number at the Candlewood Suites. I had included that in my order and had to with my billing information, however I just advised him and he said the driver was out the door. So I waited. And waited. And waited. About 35 minutes later the driver in non-Pizza Hut uniform or t-shirt or ID bypassed us and went into the hotel. The manager made him aware, as we ran in, that we were awaiting the pizza at the front door. I tipped and signed the receipt and thanked the driver as I don't think he's the one responsible for the tardiness in delivery. It was about 1030pm and traffic here was normal and we are immediately off the freeway exit. When we got to our room, the first thing we did was open the box of Waffle Fries. They looked like they were old and greasy to be completely honest. Both my partner and I tried one and then another and he said, \"These are not even room temperature\" and I agreed. The wings were fine, pizza could have been much warmer, so just popped into microwave. However, we could not continue to eat the fries. Jon called the number that had called my cell phone to contact me about the room number, the gentleman who was very kind on the phone and said pizza was going out the door. That door must have been far, far away from the parking lot as it took long time to wait outside for the pizza and fries and wings. Jon called and eventually the man, who was not at all as kind as when he called me, eventually said it was Pizza Hut. Jon told him who we were and that our Fries were not hot, not warm-maybe room temperature and greasy. Jon said \"We wanted to let you know as we just received them and they were not as advertised at all!\" The man said \"This is my personal cell phone and not the business!\" Well we didn't know that as we ordered online and he called US on my cell phone. He was bothered and offered no sort of \"I'm sorry\" and absolutely no offer to send out a hot order. We tipped well and would have tipped very well to have a kind and proper manager resend out a failed new product. They are still sitting here. In all honesty, we offered one to our dog and he had no interest. Maybe we just caught the manager on a bad night. But that's not my problem. I should have been told the actual time to expect the pizza and not the very short time that it would have been if he was out the door. The manager should have understood that we called back at the same number he called us at. He offered no offer to refund the price of the waffle fries or other warm products. We order regularly and have for many years. It's often take out and maybe that's a better route to go with this store. I'm upset that he didn't offer to send some new product out or to offer even 20 percent off the next order. Shame on you, Manager and the North Phoenix Pizza Hut."}
{"text":"Horrible service. I order a medium pan pizza half chicken mushroom and spinach. And half pepperoni mushroom olive onion. They forgot the spinach. So instead of apologizing they just throw raw spinach on top. I ask is that how they serve spinach. The female cashier replies. Yes that how we serve it. It was very unprofessional and a out right lie. I know very well that is not how you serve spinach on a pizza. But she insist that is how they do it instead of. A apology.  Needless to say I am very unhappy with how this establishment handles mistakes and customers."}

I place an online order on 12/19 around 10:25, get a call 30 MINUTES LATER from the so called \"manager\" saying \"we don't deliver to apt complexes after dark\". mind you \"dark\" is at 5:30pm this time of year.

And messed up order (they forgot one of my toppings - bacon).  See photo.  I didn't call them  to rectify the problem, they'd probably give me the run around for their mistake and having to wait for my correct order, yeah, no, I was too starved to wait.  Papa makes better pizza. Always papa from now on."}
{"text":"Pretty bad service. I only order from here, because it's the closest to my house. A few times ordering in person, I just feel like the employees are so rude & unorganized. How is it that someone who orders the same thing as me 10 minutes later, gets their stuff before I do. 

Also on the other hand, some orders aren't followed through correctly which is a very annoying. 

Oh not to mention, I found a piece of hair baked in my pizza. That was really fun. Goes to show the lack of cleanliness in the store."}

This location has always delivered good pizza,  and on the rare occasion they make an error,  they have always replaced the order in less than 30 minutes plus made up for the mistake . Really live the new menu,  but they got rid of the best crust topping (ginger boom-boom).   Considered dropping a star because of it but can't fault the location for a corporate change."}

Arrived at 740pm without one of the 2 pizzas we ordered.  The guy left to go get the other pizza, and the mgr called to ask if I wanted money put back on my card or cash.  I thought that was nice, but I thought he was still sending our pizza.  The driver showed up again, with just cash.  No pizza.  I said no, we still wanted the pizza.  He left again and finally brought our pizza, (the wrong one still) at 940.  (We ordered a thin meat lover's. It had pineapple all over it.)  The only good thing about this experience was the driver, he was pleasant, went the extra mile, and was a victim of the restaurant's poor service as much as we were.  I double tipped him.  And I told him to go to work for Papa Johns, I'll be a reference.  Don't eat here."}
{"text":"For the past 8 months it seems that quality of food and service from this location has dropped tremendously, Lil Caesar's makes better pizza and wings at a fraction of the cost. I was hoping paying 50 bucks for two pizzas and wings would render quality product, but this has not been the case. Pizza was dry, improperly cooked, improperly cut, and did not have the right ingredients. The wings were dry with no sauce. Breadsticks were burned. Pizza boxes were a greasy mess. If you wanna charge these prices I suggest you deliver the quality that comes with those prices."}
{"text":"Unfortunately this location has ruined the entire Pizza Hut experience for me. The employees seem to take no pride in the quality of the product and are amongst the least pleasant people I've experienced. My latest experience with this location included attempting to place an order but being told \"sorry, we aren't taking orders tonight\" before a hang up on the first attempt and \"we are just too busy\" on the second. Never again."}
{"text":"Worst pizza experience yet. I ordered by phone, gave CC info and got total. After 1 hour and 20 min I call to see where my delivery order was...they said they don't have an order...so i reorder w the manager Robert Harrison, who offered no consolation, and drove to the location. After all that, I waited another 20 minutes in the store to get my pizza. I'll be ordering pizza from somewhere else for now on."}
{"text":"On 2/12/2017 I ordered a large pan pizza with five toppings and a personal pizza with four toppings.  I requested delivery service and applied a $10 coupon.  The total was $17.xx after taxes.  Good deal!

Five minutes after submitting my order online, a Pizza Hut employee called to tell me that they were out of personal pan crusts and recommended a medium size pizza with the same toppings for $11.00 more.  

I was not provided a revised receipt, but the grand total was quoted at $28.xx and I agreed to it.

The delivery employee showed up shortly afterwards and the total on the receipt was $28.xx.  I clearly entered \"$0.00\" on the tip line and signed the receipt.  The driver took both copies of the receipt (with a $5.00 CASH tip) and then gave me my pizzas.

I check my bank account a few days later and noticed that the total was final at $32.xx.  THE DRIVER GAVE HIMSELF AN ADDITIONAL TIP ON TOP OF THE $5.00 CASH TIP I GAVE HIM!  

This has never happened before in the two years that I've ordered from here, but it isn't going to happen again.  I'm never ordering from THIS Pizza Hut ever again.  

Remember in the beginning when I mentioned that my original total was with a $10.00 coupon applied?  Let's say I didn't use the coupon...  $38.00 PLUS TIP for one large pizza with five toppings and a medium with four toppings?!  Really?!  Unbelievable.

Crooked staff.  Crooked drivers."}
{"text":"Great service! Justin was very friendly and helpful.  The lady that answered the phone was also helpful.  Pizzas and prices are getting better as well.  Thanks!"}
{"text":"Order 2 large pizzas with an hour and a half in advance for our lunch break at work, and specified that we needed them by 11:30 a.m. due to us only taking half an hour lunch, pizzas did not arrive until a few minutes before noon, our lunch break was almost over not only did they arrive extremely late, but the pizzas were medium instead of large. The driver was in such a hurry when he arrived, horrible service....."}
{"text":"Used to love going here from when I was young with my family. So we went today and my dad brought a coffee that he just finished buying from Tim Hortons. They said that the coffee needs to go in the garbage and can't drink while being in the restaurant. Now I find it kinda stupid considering there are 4 people that are going to eat and spend $60+ over a $2 coffee. Of course we gave them the stupidest look ever and walked out. This place hardly gets dine ins anymore and I can see why.. it's sad they lost business over a coffee. If I don't like your coffee and want to eat my pizza with a coffee I'll do so. Just not at this location."}
{"text":"I called to place my order. Today 6/4/14 and whoever worked the night shift had to have been the best person for Customer service. He was very clear and nice, and did his job really well. The food arrived within 35 mins and it was delicious. Would deff reccommend this PHD."}
{"text":"My experience was not at all what you would expect from our local Pizza Hut. The wait was much much longer than expected and the manager Taylor Hager was very rude to the 5 plus patrons that he told had to wait.  He was very ubrupt and rude to the entire room of patrons waiting. Taura at the counter wanted to offer a soda while we all waited but her manager Taylor showed his very,very poor customer service to all and would have nothing to do with his customers' needs. When ordering they told me a 20 wait over the phone but in the end the total experience was over an hour. I would suggest going down to one of the other local owned Pizza shops from now on. 

-Highly Unsatisfied with Management"}
{"text":"Our food didn't come out for an hour. There were only 2 other families in the restaurant, both who came in after us. They also ate before us. 
After 40 minutes of waiting and observing the other guests getting their food, we went up to the counter to inquire. The waitress was dishonest about having put our order in and tried to blame it on the kitchen. 
The manager thankfully comped our meal and attempted to do service recovery. They were apologetic...everyone except the dishonest waitress."}
{"text":"The food is always fast, fresh, and awesome!! The customer service is always excellent and the location is clean and spacious. I would rather drive to this location than to have delivery from another Pizza Hut because I truly enjoy the service and quality of this locations pizza."}
{"text":"Last night rather than call ahead I stopped by and ordered over the counter.  Obviously, they do most of thier business through phone orders.  The lady said, \"did u have trouble finding us?\" I said, \" no I just happened 2b nearby, was tied up and didn't call ahead\" I ordered a med size vegetarian pizza everything but olives.  I waited no more than about 15 min.  After traveling back and forth from Costa Rica and eating many Poppa Johns pizzas where you will pay nearly $20 or more for same size, I was pleasantly suprised how delicious this PH pie was, I got the thin crust bty.  Service & Pizza was excellent, I will b a reg customer.  That was my experience."}
{"text":"I ordered from this location twice and even though it was only twice , it's like each time it gets a little worst! The first time actually wasn't bad since the only thing wrong was they did not drizzle sauce on the pizza. This time however, the pizza came cold AND the crust was not even flavored! On top of that it took over an hour. The woman was sweet but the quality of the food I am getting is making me wish I ordered Chinese instead"}
{"text":"Raw dough, and incorrect orders. Asked for well done and it wasn't done. It's bad when I can write a happy face in the bread aka dough. Would never reccomend."}
{"text":"I always come here for the wings(carry out) and they always tell me 15 minutes.  You'd think that after the 5th time they made me wait, I'd have this figured out by now.  Wings are great but that is because I always get them fresh because I have to wait additional 10-15 minutes after the allotted wait time.  Just thought I'd let you guys know that if you are ordering carry out, leave your house at 15 minutes and it might be ready when you show up."}
{"text":"Horrible service. Ordered online for delivery, waited 2 hours and had to call their store to hear that the driver \"tried\" to deliver my food. They said my phone number and address was wrong, but my confirmation email had all of my information correct. Poor customer service."}
{"text":"i have been a customer for pizza hut for many years. i have not had any problem. even when i lived in other states it's all pizza hut....there's a staff name jason he is a very nice kid he had never made a mistake on my order.  when my pizza gets delivered it's super hot....i don't know why some of this customers would complain about there pizzas being cold....mine is never cold..."}
{"text":"Where to begin. We ordered a cheese pizza and when it arrived the driver didn't show us the pizza  once we opened the box it looked like someone sat on it. It was smashed together. We asked the driver Matt what the heck is up with this pizza and he said what I've never seen that before and we had to call Sadie( the manager) that she would take care of it.  Needles to say she did NOT. She told my husband that we would have to wait 1 hour till we get the new pizza. We called back and asked for a refund and Sadie said she needs permission in order to complete the refund. So we have no pizza and with no refund. Worst service ever!!!!"}
{"text":"Would give no stars if an option. Management is non-existent or they just ignore the customer. Staff are clueless and dishonest. Papa Johns off Eastfield Rd. is great and would recommend going to them for pizza orders."}
{"text":"If I could give this zero stars I would! I placed an order online at 8:15, Online said it was going to take an hour. That seemed like a long time but we were not in a rush. At 9:40 my husband called to see what was going on and they told him the driver was in an accident and they are getting another driver to bring the pizza. Called back at 10:15 and it was a different story, when they finally found our order they said it was cancelled 6 minutes before I called. We never cancelled the pizza. Spoke to the Manager Brittany and she said they could not figure out if someone took the pizza or if it was even made so they cancelled it. Mind you we never received a call about it being cancelled only the last conversation about a \"car accident\" and that it would be on the way. Brittany did not care that we had been waiting for a pizza for 2hrs! They need to get their shit together at this location! I will never order from them again."}
{"text":"Horrible customer service. I would give 0 stars if the application allows for it, avoid this place at all costs, many other pizza joints literally down the road, pizzaiollo and pizza pizza, along others, with way better  customer service and food."}
{"text":"This Pizza Hut is pretty awesome the service is great the food is also really fast and really convenient. 
Open till midnight 
Awesome hot cookie and the brownie is a triple chocolate overload madness of chocolate"}
{"text":"Placed an order by phone for wings, when I got to the store they said they didn't have my order.  The very young and inexperienced Manager Maria, kept insisting that I had not called and started going through their caller ID to confirm.  She stated I may have called the call center and if that was the case my number would not show up on their caller ID.  I stated that is fine but even if I had called the call center why do they not have my order?  This conversation goes around and around for about 5-10 minutes and I finally just said please just make my order so I can leave. Maria did not appreciate my frustration or my tone and decided that she would not make my food.  I asked for the manager's name and she refused to give it to me, so I called the Pizza Hut Corporate Office.  I also called today to speak with her Manager, who she advised yesterday would be in today, but today she states she will not be in until Saturday.  I'm totally on board with young people getting an opportunity to advance and gain experience, but when companies put these young people in Management roles, they really should teach them how to deescalate simple situations like this and how to be proactive rather than reactive when dealing with the public.  This was some kind of mix-up that could have been so easily resolved.  Now you have a very unhappy customer, who is writing a very bad review of your company and sharing her experience with others.  Wouldn't it have just been easier to say \"I'm so sorry for that mix up ma'am, let me go ahead and get that order in for you as soon as possible and for your inconvenience we'll take 10% off\" or something along those lines........"}
{"text":"Service is outstanding. The manager I think his name is trent has always been very friendly and accomodating. The last delivery I had was so fast! The drivers name was matt, so if you want your pizza fast you should definitely request him."}
{"text":"We just got a triple treat box. We usually don't even order from Pizza Hut but the commercials got to us (Lol). This will be our last time ordering from them. Frozen pizza is better then what we got. Very dry, absolutely NO flavor.  I have to say the best part was the dipping sauce for the breadsticks. Very disappointed!"}
{"text":"We just moved back to Arizona and called this Pizza Hut since it was less than a mile from our house.  We were told they would NOT deliver to our house.  WTH???  We will never ever go to Pizza Hut again!!!"}
{"text":"Something happened to post pone our oder, and at first was really upset. The manager however was so sweet and so nice 
I felt bad dork making it a big deal in the first place. They fixed it and it was delicious. Better then those guys"}
{"text":"Ok so a couple of weeks ago I order two pizza on pepperoni and one meat lovers with stuff crust and when I picked my order up and got home I noticed that I got two pepperoni.  I returned to the store and the guy behind the counter got me my new pizza and told me that there was a free one on my account.  So I left it at and thought great I get my next pizza for free so I thought.  When I returned to the store and ordered my pizza they told me that I would have to pay five dollars for my pizza that there were limits to my free pizza.  I told them that I am ordering the same pizza that I got last time that you guys messed up on and I shouldn't have to pay a thing.  The lady said that I would have to pay the difference so I did.  Then I called and asked about another pizza and asked how much it would cost and for a large ham, pineapple and jalapeño and the lady on the phone e told me that it would be $6.75 i repeated it to her and ahe confermed it so I thought great I'll order it and pick it up I get to the store and when I got to the store it was $16.98 a completely different price that I was told on the phone.  When I told this to the manager he told me that she was new and it wouldn't happen again but would not give me a discount on it. This will be the last time that I go back to this location. Might even be the last time I go to pizza hut I would recommend anyone to go to this location if there life depended on it. They have every pour customer service and the manager is rude if you can avoid going to the store do so."}
{"text":"I placed an online order at 1:56pm for Cheesy Bites pizza with 2 toppings.  I thought this should be easy for them to make and deliver.  My confirmation email stated that the estimated delivery would be 2:25pm.  This was going to be perfect because it would have given my children enough to eat before we had company come over.  

At 2:51pm I had to call the store and ask about my order.  The person I spoke to said my order was on the way but did not ask which order I had or my name.  At about 3:00pm my pizza finally arrives from a disheveled man who looks like he left the cook line to deliver pizza.  My pizza was cold but after my wait I can't say I was surprised. 

By the time I ordered the pizza \"deal\" and paid the delivery fee and tax my single large pizza was about $16.50.  Who wants to pay that kind of price for a cold large pizza?  This kind of service reminds me why I do not order pizza often."}
{"text":"I would not recommend the Wednesday night buffet. About every 20 minutes they replenish the buffet with a random medium size pizza that of which the entire restaurant flocks to. There were numerous times when all the pizza was gone and the salad bar was the only food to be found. On a lighter note the staff is nice and the place was clean."}
{"text":"I'm really upset how this location is the ONLY Pizza Hut that offers an AYCE lunch from 11:30am to 2:00pm, it makes me wonder how come and why.

For $7 + GST and the (optional) tip you can't go wrong. If you want a certain pizza then you'll have to make your voice heard or else they'll stick to their usual pepperoni, supreme, and cheese. I've been here countless times with my girlfriend and the turn out is ALWAYS the same. Seats are self serve however the waitress seems to skip us, is it because we're Asian? I swear because every time we go we usually get the less service out of every one. Our last visit on Wednesday December 7th, we never received our order of $12 for 20 wings and never got a refill in our beverage. Even though we ordered wings and never received them we weren't charged. During our visit I'm not sure if Pizza Hut was prepared because they didn't have any Pizza ready until 11:55am (yes I timed it) and when they set out the first 2 they were gone because there was a LOT of people who took more than 2 and there was a lot of people on that day.

Would I recommend this Pizza Hut for dine in? It's the only location that offers AYCE so might as well."}
{"text":"Sometimes I like to eat terrible pizza when I am depressed, so I will go to the hut occasionally to pick up some bad pizza. The pizza is so bad that it even makes me feel good about how bad I am. I'm so lonely. Never close pizza hut."}
{"text":"The classic supreme pizza is the best . The new gourmet pizzas are like eating out of a trash can!"}
{"text":"The only good thing I can say is arrived after 28 minutes. I happened to look at the counter on their website when my doorbell rang. I ordered a large thin crust pizza, half just cheese and half with bacon, mushroom, and red onion. When I say there were about 5 little crumbles of bacon across 4 pieces of pizza I'm not exaggerating. There were about 6 pieces of mushroom and 8 pieces of red onion. I think their cook is personally trying to save the company money, one pepperoni at a time.  The pizza was also cold. I added on garlic butter flavor to the crust and it was disgusting. It was really \"fake\" tasting and too strong. I forced down a slice because I was starving. It was awful. I've never liked Pizza Hut but I had it at my sister's (not from this one) a couple weeks ago and it was pretty good so I thought I'd give them another try. 

I gave up and took a nap instead of calling them. Then, the more I thought about, the more I knew I shouldn't have to pay for that. I called and spoke to a manager who could give 2 sh*ts about my crappy food but immediately refunded my $ so I was happy. 

How do they stay in business?"}
{"text":"Horrible experience! After waiting an hour I got a cold pizza delivered to me! Best of all it had no sauce! Didn't want to wait so just got jimmy johns next door! Called the manager, Denice to explain frustration of what transpired the previous day only to be told to argue with the rude manager. This place sucks!"}
{"text":"Placed an order today and the only good thing I can say is the food was hot. I waited an extra 20 minutes after it said my order was ready, had a missing topping that they threw on top last minute making a spinach salad on top of my pizza. Ugh just a bad experience every time."}
{"text":"I called 6:00pm quoted 20min i saw ready time on screen 6:17pm its 6:28pm employees seems does not know what their doing.. i'd give it a 0 if i can"}
{"text":"This is the absolute worst pizza hut i have ever been to. If I could give them negative 5 stars, I would and I am only giving 1 star because I have to. Every time I have had the displeasure of going there, its a problem. First of all, they NEVER answer the phone. Never. There's no way you will ever get through on the phone so dont even bother, you'll be on hold for hours -thats if they dont have the phone hanging off the hook so it doesn't even ring. I have personally seen them do this. Another time, I placed an order online, and I completed the order and confirmed it. I waited for HOURS. It never came. And of course I couldn't get through on the phone. I went in to speak to the manager, she was no help whatsoever and none of the employees, not even the MANAGER knew the phone number to their corporate office, supposedly. They didn't even care what I had to say. So tonight, I made the mistake of trying them again. I decided to go a different route and do a carry out. I placed my order online, said it would be 15 mins, ready at 8:10. I go in at 8:15 the girl tells me there's still 5 people ahead of me and if I didn't mind waiting 8-10 more minutes. Im like, do I have a choice? So I go back to my car and wait about 15 more minutes, go back inside, still not ready. I sit there for another forever and a half and finally she tells me they are cutting my pizza. Its ready.  Finally. An hour after my supposed pick up time. She opens the box... NOT WHAT I ORDERED. you've got to be kidding me. She tells me I must have entered it in wrong,  and if I want I can wait for them to make another one. ARE YOU EFFING KIDDING ME?! No. I did not enter it in wrong, I can show you my order confirmation, but I am not going to waste any more of  my time on you idiots. Second, there is no way I am going to wait another hour for you to make another pizza, which will probably be wrong again. Needless to say, I just walked out of there...hungry and pissed off... without a pizza.  I cant even deal with this level of stupidity. Sadly, I will never ever go to pizza hut again.. and i suggest you drive an extra few miles to find a different location if you are in this area...holla Dominoes!"}
{"text":"I've had two bad experiences with this store. The first time, I ordered a pizza with Salami and Peruvian Cherry Peppers. The delivery time came and went, and after calling the store, the driver showed up twenty minutes later and informed me that the store was out of Salami, so they didn't put it on my pizza. If they had called me ahead of time I would have been fine with that and ordered a different something else, but the negligence really bothered me. I would have not ordered again, but after calling customer service I was compensated with two free pizza coupons. The next time I ordered, the delivery driver took an hour and a half to show up. He called and I had to give him directions and even give my address to him (I live less than two miles from pizza hut). When he arrived he was visibly impaired. He misplaced the two liter I ordered and instead gave me two dollars, saying there was a store up the street. Fifteen minutes later, the manager called me and asked if I had seen the driver. DO NOT ORDER FROM THIS STORE"}
{"text":"It has takes one hour - and counting for our pizza to come here. This service is DISGUSTING. Wish had never ordered it. I almost got another pizza from a different place."}

{"text":"I used to be a very loyal customer here but something has changes , I don't know if its management or something but they used to be very good. The past few time I've ordered they are very nice on the phone and delivering BUT my food shows up late and cold ... I live right around the corner you can walk and the pizza should still be hot. So I most definitely call and tell them about what is going on ... Today I was going to order because I should have had a 20$ credit the lady argued with me for like 5 mins with the end result being she gave me my 20$ credit and was told I'll never get credit again because I have gotten to much in the passed ... REMIND YOU I live walking distance it shouldn't be late or cold!!! So I told her no never mind I don't want the pizza and I will not be ordering pizza from them any longer ... I love pizza hut but till they get their crap together and go back to how they used to be I'm no longer a customer here at this location!!!"}
{"text":"This was the worst pizza hut experience I think I have ever had. I ordered pasta and bread sticks and after waiting about 45 minutes to recieve my food they only brought the bread sticks. When I asked the driver where the rest of the food was he told me, with a attitude, that is all thats on the receipt. I asked him does it make since that my total is $13 and change and I only ordered bread sticks? He then told me its nothing he can do you need to call the office. Called the office and was put on hold for 5 mins wating on the manager. When I explained what happen her response was \"so all your missing is pasta\"? To me that was the main portion. She then told me she could send it out to me asap. I said am I suppose to eat cold bread sticks with the pasta? She said well you have 2 options I can remake the whole order or credit your account for the bread sticks, which I found that to be a joke saying that bread sticks only cost a couple of dollars. Long story short, it took them a hour to bring my food totalling 1:45 to get my while order and had to deal with attitude like it was my fault. Worst experience ever and will not deal with this pizza hut again!"}
{"text":"This place doesn't even deserve a star.  The customer service was poor and rude when the girl who answered and than decided to hang up the phone  as I was trying to place an order. I Tried to call back and they pick up and hung up no reason at all.  They simply can NOT do there JOB right.  Don't order from this place or it will end up being wrong  or something else done to it if still continue to order.  Pizza Hut need to evaluate there staff on performance and customer service!"}

{"text":"Love the 10 dollars pizza of the day deal! Come here almost once a week. Remember u can order the large pizza of the day for 10 dollars as well the default option on the website is medium. Didn't know that when I first ordered it online...... it is much better than dominos pizza in my opinion."}
{"text":"Delivery guy forgot my drinks and acted like no big deal. Horrible"}
{"text":"Stay away. I ordered a veggie with three toppings and was served a cold, foul smelling pizza. We called them back to let them know that the mushrooms and tomato used in the pizza were not fresh. Their response was more like what else I expected. We threw entire pizza.  My suggestion, stay away from it and eat some healthy stuff elsewhere."}
{"text":"Never answers. Have called and complained, no response.  Tried to update an existing order so they could make even more of a profit and they never answered.  Let me order delivery, then called and said I had to pick it up because they discontinued delivery to my area (10 minutes from the store).Even after the corporate Pizza Hut tried to reach them, they never had a response.Corporate had no explanation as to why they won't deliver,seemed baffled themselves. Done trying, Dominos it is!"}

{"text":"After making an order online, I found a hair baked into my slice of pizza! Immediately, I became disgusted and ruined my whole families appetite and mines. I called and talked to the Manager Billy who was completely unprofessional and arrogant, he then demanded I bring back the pizza (we threw this pizza away) or else he couldn't replace our order. After explaining that I threw this pizza away, his response was \"What are you trying to get something for free\"? I have a history with Pizza Hut and they can look up my number and I have never asked for a refund of any one of my orders, I am a hard working man who don't need a $7.99 pizza for \"FREE\" all I wanted was to provide my family with dinner of their choice. After all the other options there is in laveen, we will be ordering Barro's next time and EVERY TIME after! See my picture I attached to this Pizza Hut if you don't believe me."}
{"text":"I don't normally bother writing reviews for fast food chains. Everyone knows about them, and even if the reviews were low, they would still go because of price and convenience. That being said, this particular location always gets my pizza dollars when I want takeout. Ordering online is easy (as it oughtta be), with the little timer that tells me when my order is ready for pickup. This place is a five minute drive from my place, so I don't mind. The pizza is always consistent when I order here--I never have to worry about it being decent some days and barely edible others.

But what made this location earn my customer loyalty is the service. The people inside are always friendly, prompt, and professional. From the manager to the cooks, everyone is super cool and never show it to the customers that they're working fast food for minimum wage. Even the young high school-looking workers are happy to assist you. That should tell you a lot about how the management hires and trains their staff. I've even taken time to answer the little survey on the pizzahut website after picking up my order--in hopes of this location gets recognized by corporate.

Drawbacks: It's located in a semi-sketchy part of Boulder Highway, so be prepared to be asked for $ by beggars in the parking lot at any time, day or night. In fact, make sure to lock your vehicle if you come after dark. The parking lot is busy and well-lit, but I've often seen unsavory folks lurking about. And it's still pizza hut pizza--the kids love it, but it is what it is. I'll have a slice or two, but that's my limit. Not the healthiest pizza and definitely not gourmet, but it's fast and cheap."}
{"text":"Fire CC the supposed assistant manager.  This is the second time in a row our order was mishandled and when I complained to CC both times she had all kinds of excuses and when I persisted she gave me a fictitious corporate phone number to complain to (800-835-3370 good luck complaining at that number) and then told me to get out of her store.  I did not leave her store as I had already paid $51.83 for pizza.  There are signs all over the store if not satisfied let us know and we will make it right.  Obviously that is bull She did nothing either time and this time it appeared all she wanted to do was show off to the help by trying to have me get out of her store.  I might add the two sides I ordered were both french fries but alas when I got it home and opened I had one order of fries and one order of chicken wings.  Not only would we not recommend this store we will no longer order from there as which by the way our orders are always range from over $30.00 to over $50.00."}

I tipped the driver ten dollars and called her back... she said she wouldn't take complaints over the phone!! Rude!!!! I will be ordering from dominos from now on this manager was sooo rude and uncaring for her workers!!!"}
{"text":"Service service service is the name of the game. Service is apparently something they don't teach at pizza hut univ. 

This is the second time I ordered online and scheduled a timed pickup. For the second time, they are not busy and I am still waiting. Usually I don't mind a wait of a few reasonable minutes . But I ordered 45 min ago then drove in from Ft. Mill. A wait should never have taken place. 

The pizza itself was passable for industry pizza. However , my wings were overcooked and they were the wrong flavor. 

Needless to say, this was a memorable experience. I dare say exceptional. Too bad it was an exceptional miss."}

I asked where my order was, they said \"delivery guy is on the way\", and hung up. My house is a five minute drive from their store, and the guy shows up 15 minutes later. Not one single \"sorry about the wait\", from the manager nor the delivery guy. Ridiculous customer service, i have no idea why they are still open. NEVER order here."}

What i got on the other hand... half the pizza is missing cheese, there is 14 pieces of bacon on the whole pizza and Im not even sure there is bacon on it... Thanks for ripping me off Pizzahut"}
{"text":"This is my local delivery spot. Its pizza hut but what I like is the attitude of the management. Unlike many places in Las Vegas the General manager, Mike is very friendly and will do whatever it takes to please his customers. I have never had a serious issue and my pizza has reliably arrived on average about 45 minutes after placing an order."}
{"text":"20 minutes late with pizza that wasn't just cold, but dry as well....AGAIN?...how? I order From 42nd street and thomas and it takes over an hour to get cold, dry pizza...time and again...? And they missed the crust coating....AGAIN? Shame on me, don't waste your time folks, 1 bad experience isn't cool when it's your money spent, and I've had like 8 bad experiences here, let me be the fool who tried too many times to see if it could be good, cuz I can tell you now it won't be.

Long story short.... love pizza Hut but I would find the next closest one or a different company, because this place is a JOKE."}
{"text":"This pizza hut is very hit and miss, but mostly miss.

The main problem is not enough sauce.  In order to combat this, I even ordered extra sauce but there was still barely any on the pizza.

They are generally good about giving a lot of crust flavor, but sauce and cheese game is too weak.  Better off at Little C's."}
{"text":"Always has been good but tonight we ordered a large supreme and was delivered a pepperoni instead. It was late so we didn't protest when we discovered it so we ate Th pepperoni. Disappointing."}
{"text":"After placing my online order which gave me a verified time to pickup, I pay for my order at specified time and was told it would be another 20 minutes because they took a large order after mine. Customer service is not a priority, when speaking with the general manager Taylor Hagor, he said basically - tough luck and didn't even offer anything for the inconvenience. I will go to my favorite place next time instead of going to a place with no organizational skills again."}
{"text":"This Pizza Hut is located at a hidden plaza. They seemed to know most of the customers. They definitely need more traffic."}
{"text":"Very displeased. Pizza came later than scheduled. Pizza was cold & the box was all bent as if someone had sat on it. And to top it off one piece of hair inside the cheese crust, disgusting."}
{"text":"Decided to try something new and placed my order online and it arrived luke warm which was surprising because it was burnt and the pepperoni was overcooked. To make it worse there was no sauce! We had ordered stuffed crust and the cheese was the consistency of an old cheese stick - not melted at all. The wings were also horrible and room temperature. The sauce was the consistency of soup and really salty. The chipits cookie was stale.
Don't waste your money."}
{"text":"Very pleased with the quick delivery. Always on time or arrives earlier than promised. Pizza is great and desserts are really good. I always order here whenever I want a quick dinner. No hassles, fast, easy and delicious."}
{"text":"Ordered pizza for a 5:15 pick up. My husband gets there to pick it up and the delivery driver took the wrong order, so they remake it. He gets it 15 mins later, no harm, no foul. We got home and the pizza is so greasy and disgusting that it is pretty much just falling apart and my kids won't even eat it. Trust me, that's saying a lot of how gross it was when my kids won't eat a cheese pizza. Called and talked to the manager Kenny and asked if we could have it delivered since they messed up twice. He said there's no way they could do that, it's for carry out only. I asked then if we could get another pizza for free since they messed up our order twice and my husband now has to drive all the way over there AGAIN due to their mistake. He said no, and offered us cheese sticks. I said we already ordered cheese sticks and we don't need anymore but an extra pizza would be nice. He offered me Wings and we don't eat wings, so I said a plain cheese pizza is about the same price so why cant we get something like that that we can actually eat because it's an hour of waiting now to eat some food due to their mess ups. All he would offer is to remake it. So my husband's going to pick it up now, but I'm hesitant to eat it because who knows what they've done to it now that I pissed them off, and the quality was so poor to begin with. I have ordered here many times, but I won't be back. Ridiculous that they can't offer a better customer service. Especially when I order there frequently. I can see from past reviews that this is a common occurrence.

Updates 1/1/18: sitting in this effing place for 25 mins after scheduled pick up time trying to give them one more chance. After sitting here for 20 mins they magically realized they missed cooking some of my pizzas. I have had guests waiting at my house for me for the last 30 mins. This place is just terrible. Offered me free breadsticks but WHY did you not know until 20 mins of me sitting here that my shit wasn't correct? Worst Pizza Hut ever. Same manager as last time. AVOID."}
{"text":"I ordered carryout because I knew if I ordered delivery it would take over 2 hours, if not more . They need new phones because the person taking the order either was deaf or seriously couldn't hear. I get there and the place is CHAOTIC. I couldn't even hear myself think. Not to mention my bread sticks were hard almost like brick and tasted like card board. Very disappointing! Lastly, the manager has NO control whatsoever and seems like he's afraid to take authority over a mislead crew."}
{"text":"Why did I give this Pizza Hut 5 stars? 

1) First and foremost, consistently friendly staff. Sad to say, but nowadays this sticks out. I lost count on how many times I have left an establishment and said \"thank you\" to utter silence (Hint: It should be the other way around) Half the time when I thank a server these days, their response is \"yep.\"  Not \"you're welcome\" but \"yep.\" The staff at this location has always been engaged and polite. 

2) Pizza is consistently great. 

That's enough to warrant five stars in my book."}
{"text":"Just recently ordered food there with a friend last night at 8:30 pm, they said 150 minute wait well it got to be 9:45 before we called back, got hung up on 3 times then tried to call back and by that time the phone line was closed. Well come to find out at 12:15am the delivery guy was picking on the door and the slip said 9:30 delivery! WTF?! I felt bad because the delivery person scared her kids and she didn't oboe who it was and was about to call the cops. Terrible service with new one called us to inform us. We had to scramble last minute at 10:30pm at night for food. Not cool!"}
{"text":"Two issues with this place.   First I watched them make their food with NO gloves after picking up trash from the floor, answering the phone and using the PC.   It was very unsanitary.   When I commented to them about this, they offered to remake the food.  When they started to remake it , once again no gloves until I requested them.  Also it was a very long wait for the food.   Needless to say, I will never return.  If I could do zero stars, I would."}
{"text":"We ordered wings and breadsticks.  When we went to pick up our order on time it wasn't ready.   We ordered hot wings but we didn't receive hot wings.  The wings we got looked like they were honey barbecue and then they put they put the hot sauce on top.  Did they give us old wings? They were very sweet and looked like they had been repurposed.  Definitely going to barros next time."}
{"text":"I wish I could rank this location .5 of a star. One star is far of a stretch. I placed an order around 8:30. Called to check on it at 10. Was told I needed to wait another 20 minutes. It finally arrived at 10:35. I had ordered a large pizza, with breadsticks and a two liter. I was handed a cold pizza, no breadsticks and I almost didn't get my Pepsi. I will be filing a formal complaint."}
{"text":"Called at  7pm, they are open till 11pm, 
I was told they are not delivering, I live a 20 minute walk away from this store, the weather is clear, i called the last 2 days and the same thing at different times, 
They have a track record of closing early, and not delivering past 8 pm, back when i ordered more regulry, i don't recommend this place unless you are desperate!"}
{"text":"Ordered pizza, wings and a 2 liter soda today. I had placed the order online and had asked for a regular Pepsi instead of diet by mistake. When The delivery driver James arrived with everything I had told him I wanted Diet Pepsi and he told me no worries lll go get it for you and bring it back. I felt really bad but he was super nice about it and was back in less than 10 minutes! Thanks James! Your amazing! Excellent customer service!!! The food was great too!"}
{"text":"Every time I order from this Pizza Hut they are friendly and my order is always hot and right on time!!"}
{"text":"Ordered online today took 1 hr and 30 minutes to get delivered, and my pizza was cold . I don't think I'll order from this location again ."}
{"text":"It was very Crowded. But they had the most sweetest, and patience woman at the front all by herself she was doing a awesome job. However they need more help so somebody needs to apply here. But as far as customer service goes she did a really good job. Her name is Shannon!"}
{"text":"Très mauvais service nous avons attendu au moins 20 minutes avant que la serveuse décide de venir nous voir. , un autre 10 minutes pour recevoir nos verres d'eau et les frites sont arrivés mais la pizza et les repas enfants ont suivi 30 minutes plus tard"}
{"text":"Picked up our pizza and it wasn't that hot. Still ate it, however after eating the pizza, a couple of hours after I felt sick. 

Today being the next day I feel nausea, diarrhea and I feel like I haven't slept for days. 

Body achy, I just feel \"sick\" 

:/"}
{"text":"This location is the worst! Whether I call in or order online...they NEVER have my order ready. I always leave later, so as to give them plenty of time too! And my pizza is still under cooked or just soggy! They take forever to answer the phone!"}
{"text":"Really Good, Came in For The Buffet the cook came to us to tell us what kind of pizza we want .. overall Great!"}
{"text":"Could be better, lacking employees, and a salad bar. Miss the old style pizza huts. It is nice to not have to clean up a mess though."}
{"text":"I've had quite a bad experience with this pizza hut. My roommate and I ordered a pizza a few,weeks ago, the wait was ridiculously long. After about 2 hours our pizza was delivered. We open the box and it was wrong! We called the store and they gave us a credit for a pizza of equal value. The other night we decided to use our credit. We called the store and were greeted with such a rude tone. We told the girl on the phone about our prior experience and how we have a credit, she was no help. We asked if there was a manager we could talk to and she told us she was the manager. We held our heads in exasperation, and gave her our number again.  Turns out we did have a credit. She told us we gave her the wrong number(we didnt) the pizza finally gets here and is completely wrong. Not wanting to have to wait the extra time for them to deliver the pizza we went down to the pizza hut location. Turns out the girl on the phone wasnt a manager at all! We talked with the real manager, who was absolutely understanding. She apologized and everything else was good. The only reason im giving two stars instead of one is because of how kind the actual manager was to us. The pizza was good, but nobody should have to go through that much trouble to have dinner."}
{"text":"Went to dine in at this location. Easy to grab a table; in fact the restaurant was practically empty!   We ordered a couple personal pizzas; the quality was alright, but nothing to rave about.

The tables and restaurant were clean, but to me it kind of smelled like cleaning chemicals... 

Overall not really recommended to dine in at this Pizza Hut."}
{"text":"Ok so I gave this place ago twice I love pizzeria worst mistake delivery took 3 hours I called and manager told me she canceled my order without a call to my phone I waited on pizzeria to find no knocks on my door that's not it my card was charged and I'm still waiting on my money smh 
My mom and sister went in to eat to forever for pizza then waitress was horrible she said umm after every word 
me: I would like a pepperoni pizza 
Waitress umm that would be large or umm medium
That went on the whole convo ...
So too sum this place up umm ghetto"}
{"text":"I give them 0 stars. horrible service when I ordered online my order was sent to them in error. Evidently they no longer delivered to me they called me and told me they called my order to the correct store and I needed to call them to give him my card. when I called the new store they had not heard from them they called around and 45 minutes after my original order they have just cancelled my order and not done anything with it. Now the wait was over an hour! I will never ever order from Pizza Hut again you guys lost a 10 year customer. when I asked them to deliver it sooner based on the fact that they made a huge mistake not me, they refused. I will tell everyone I know how horrible Pizza Hut is."}
{"text":"Ordered a pizza, the location is literally in front of my apartment complex and my pizza was cold. Must have been sitting there for for almost an hour for as cold as it was, the drive from this location to my apartment door is all of anout five minutes. I ordered a soda and its
obvious it was never placed in a fridge. Cold pizza and warn soda. Horrible!"}
{"text":"It took them 1.5 hours to deliver a uncooked & cold pizza. When I called to let them know that it was not edible, I was told that someone would come and pick the pizza up and bring a correctly cooked one.  

No one showed up."}
{"text":"Worst pizza hut. We only go here occasionally because we keep praying it will get better.. It never does.. Worst staff and service... Freaking horrible!! First they \"dropped\" our pizza and had to make another.. then they forgot to put mushrooms on the next one.. we left a tip and got the hell out of there. Management should be ashamed! Your staff is horrible and racists! We will NEVER return.. this time just was the last straw."}
{"text":"ZERO STARS!!! This experience doesn't represent the band well at all. The food was great, I went during the buffet, but that's it.  I asked for no refills cause the staff took away my soda while I was in the middle of it.  The refill machine is accessible for anyone, even though it was in between the dining area and kitchen, I saw about 6-8 people refill their sodas.  But when I did it, they were hostile and told me that I couldn't. I overheard staff members using profanity and insults and when it was time for us to pay, it took 20-25 minutes.  I eventually got my cash, but after I left I realized i was shorted two dollars, and feel me and my friends should be compensated for this experience.  Unacceptable."}
{"text":"I came in last night and took the time to sign up for free cheesy bread sticks. I entered and picked up my order and the lady who gave me my order said I wasn't able to receive my bread sticks. Customer service isn't high at this location."}
{"text":"I really hate leaving reviews but I feel like someone needs to let this Pizza Hut know that every single time we order from them, the pizza is undercooked. Turn your ovens up and don't overtop please! Also, our sodas are ALWAYS flat. Pizza Hut is my favorite pizza place, but not this one."}
{"text":"I ordered on Jan 1 and the total for 4 med pizza and wings came up to over $50. The stuffed crust pizza cost me extra money but it did not show on the website. Regardless, the pizza crust tasted like cardboard and Pizza pizza is way better. They cheaped out on the toppings and my chicken and hamm pizza only had a few pieces on chicken where only 2 slices and 2 small pieces of chicken on it. for the price, i could have gotten more and better pizza somewhere else. I am very disappointed with this location. They also ran out of shrimp which was advertised on the website but i ordered early so i am assuming they did not want to give me shrimp. made a complaint to pizza hut and no response."}
{"text":"$22 for a large pizza? And the pizza looked like a medium size. We got the Meat Lover's pizza with the cheese crust. Toppings were skimpy, crust was underdone.  The boneless wings weren't bad, but they were very very small with only a small drizzling of sauce. 
Overall, we were extremely disappointed. The whole meal of 1 large pizza and 8 wings was $32....and we picked it up at the store!
We will NEVER go back."}
{"text":"2:15 hours for delivery, I could gone to a restaurant had dinner and been home.     NEVER AGAIN Pizza Hut"}
{"text":"My experience with this Pizza Hut has been awful. I am writing this review while I still wait for my order. I placed my order online and was given an estimated time. That time has come and gone so I decided to call in and see if there was any update. I had to call in twice because I was on hold for so long the call was disconnected. When I called in the second time The phone was unpleasantly answered by Francine. When I asked about my order she was extremely rude and short. Without giving me any information she told me to \"wait my turn\" From the other reviews it seems this Pizza Hut is very poorly ran and has employees that do not care to represent themselves or the company in a positive way. 

Pizza came..... It's Cold of course.
I will never order here again"}
{"text":"We switched to this location after the one on Jones stopped delivering.  I was pleasantly surprised to see how much better the food was prepared and quickly delivered.  I'd go five stars but sometimes my online coupons don't work here."}
{"text":"It takes fucking hours for them to deliver. I ordered online and it says 25-35 mins. And it's been 3 hours since then and still no fucking pizza."}
{"text":"I went to pizza Hut and had a great time. I got a medium cheese pizza and a root beer. I loved the pizza except it had a little too much sauce on it and had a weird sour taste but blended in well with the cheese. Our waiter was really nice and made her job look easy. I went with my 3 other family members and the table was very small so it was hard to eat with two medium pizzas in the middle of the table. But overall, we had a very nice time at Pizza Hut."}
{"text":"I ordered a basket of waffle fries and boneless chicken wings. I placed my order at around 10:45. It is now 1:13 am and my food is cold, soggy, and all around terrible. On top of that, i ordered a tea which i did not receive. So, i basically paid for microwave quality food and a tea someone else gets to drink later. Cool. Worst experience ever. I will never order from Pizza Hut again and I'll probably call during business hours to get my money back."}
{"text":"fantastic manager, helped us get all kinds of discounts. we have always had good experiences here, but this visit just took it over the top. deffinately would make me a return customer."}
{"text":"This Pizza Hut has fast pick up times, even during peak hours. Their pizzas are good and consistent.  They always have coupons out in the mail or online, too. I've ordered on the app, which is always convenient, but calling works too. The staff is also friendly and incredibly helpful!"}
{"text":"I ordered a pizza and a brownie and waited 1 1/2 hrs ,called to check on it they said 15 min its on its way. I called back an hour later and they said I wasn't even in the system that I never ordered  after being on hold for 15 more min  then the guy told me I can place another order or go somewhere else .the guy was very rude"}
{"text":"Horrible! Waited forever for our appetizer and forever again for our pizza which was ridiculously overcooked. It was supposed to be a cheese lovers pizza but had the least amount of cheese I have ever hat on pizza. It was cardboard. The waitress hung around in the kitchen the whole time. Another table of patrons actually got up to ask the kitchen if their food would be ready soon. All of the patrons including myself had to get up to go to the front of the restaurant to get our cheque. I will never go back. Vapid service and lazy execution!"}
{"text":"Placed an order for delivery. 20 minutes after the supposed delivery time I called to find out where the driver was. Come to find out the driver cancelled the order. The guy on the phone said the driver \"attempted calling\" however no phone call was made. We sat by the phone waiting the entire time. I recommend going to a different Pizza Hut, the customer service here is NOT GOOD. Wish I would have read the reviews prior to ordering from here."}
{"text":"Been here 3 times and the only time it was a good experience was the first time. The second time I ordered was okay except for the small error in forgetting to add a flavor to the crust, easy to deal with, the pizza was good otherwise. Just got home with my pizzas tonight and they were pretty much all wrong. Flavored crusts on the completely wrong pizzas, one of the pizzas wasn't even the right crust type, no extra sauce on one of them. I just don't understand how hard It is to read. Being a server myself, and also having worked at a pizza place before I know personally this is not a hard job. I don't know what the interview process is here, but clearly the expectations aren't very high at all. I will not be giving them anymore business."}
{"text":"Customer service was excellent. They couldn't co plate my order. I was contact immediately and given an easy solution. When picking up my order the service was fantastic. Very friendly."}
{"text":"I am torn. I am not a huge fan of pizza in general (i know, I'm weird) but since pizza hut revamped their menu i actually like getting their 11$ any topping large pizza. its a great deal and i get to have all my favorite things on it (banana peppers, olives, pineapple, bacon, salami, fresh spinach, and more) they are not always the most common toppings and at most places it costs a fortune to get them all. I get all these on their pretzel crust with balsamic drizzle and its a pizza i actually like to eat....but.... delivery takes forever, its always 40minutes minimum usually longer. and the three times I've ordered this they have messed up twice, both times it had to do with the drizzle. if you are going to empliment this unique thing you should really have a system worked out where the customer doesn't end up with sriracha drizzle when they asked for balsamic, or it doesn't end up on just half of the pizza instead the whole somehow. the delivery person has always been nice, when they finally arrive, so i am excited about their new food but a bit disappointed in the execution of it all."}
{"text":"They gave me the wrong order. I called back tell them about it, the guy didn't apologize or do anything about it. He just hung up the phone."}
{"text":"I keep ordering from them & I don't know why? Something is always wrong! Wrong pizza, bring the wrong order. One of the delivery guys told me that things are so unorganized there. Called management and she didn't even apologize, that we got the wrong pizza. She was just quite."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I order from this pizza hut semi-often and it use to be fine for a quick mediocre snack when we were too lazy to cook, but now this place is just awful! The food has some how become even more low quality and the delivery is always late. I have probably ordered from here 20+ times in the 2 1/2 years I have lived at the same address and they still claim they are late because they cannot find my apt, nor can they call me because my area code is out of state. Tonight we gave this place one last try and they totally failed. Our food was over half an hour late, cold, and mushy. Sorry pizza hut, I would rather drive somewhere myself to get hot food and deal with people who know the definition of customer service."}
{"text":"Visited this restaurant even after a bad experience ordering food. So surprised this is still open! Food was too greasy... Really dirty carpet... Server was nice though. If you're craving this kind of food just to to Boston pizza or something .... This is overpriced"}
{"text":"Typical Pizza Hut. You either love their pizza or hate it. Still my favorite chain."}
{"text":"This review is for the delivery service at this location. I will NEVER order from this location again. It is the only Pizza Hut that delivers to my area, but I will just have to make do. 

I wanted to order online, so I looked up the deals, found my location with the bright \"Online Ordering\" badge next to it, and got ready to order. After I clicked next, it informed me that this location does not accept online orders. Why did they put the badge there then? 

Anyway, I was really craving some pizza, so I called the number. I spoke with a woman who sounded less than excited to take my order. I gave my name, phone number, address, order, and finally paid with my card. She said it would be there in 40 minutes. 

After an hour and a half of waiting I called to make sure everything was okay. I spoke with one female, who could not find my order. She then handed the phone to a second female, who could not find my order. They sounded confused, as though they weren't really sure how to do whatever they were doing to find my order. I had called back the same location and same phone number as I did when I ordered, and gave them the same phone number to look up my order with - which apparently is the ONLY way they can look up an order, not even with name or address, they said. That makes no sense. 

Regardless, my pizza never came, so the woman I talked to the very first time didn't even enter it, or didn't enter it right. By the time I got to the third person on the phone, asking me the same questions as I had already answered for the first two women I was done. Obviously I wasn't getting a pizza anytime soon, and I most definitely wasn't going to place an order with them again, so I got off the phone so I could finally get my dinner I'd been waiting two hours for now. 

Which takes me full circle as to why I wanted to place my order online. It is trackable, and I don't have to depend on some random person on the phone who may or may not enter my information.

In the end, my Chipotle was very delicious and satisfying."}
{"text":"I tried them one last time, and I shouldn't have! I called my order in, then remembered how they are always getting orders wrong, and called back to confirm my order again. When they FINALLY answered, the girl confirmed my order. 
Well, wouldn't you know... The delivery driver brought my food, and they had left off 2 of my items! She was nice enough to rush back and get them, but when I finally got the missing items they were mushy and gross.

This location can NEVER get anything right. If it's not a wrong order, the pizza is undercooked. I will never go back. Ever.."}
{"text":"I just ordered 14 garlic parmesan WingStreet wings, and WOW they were bad.
Greasy, very little meat, and so much bread coating it was just disgusting.
This experience really made me appreciate quality chicken wings from just about anywhere else.  GROSS WINGS DO NOT ORDER!"}
{"text":"Awful..... will never order from again waiting over an hour and a half for delivery when it was suppose to be a 45 minute delivery"}
{"text":"Very disappointed, i love Pizza Hut, however this location has changed that, just moved and this Hut is closest (unfortunately)... Ordered online and got an incorrect delivery, hot wing containers smashed in, though the order was somewhat right according to the receipt but incorrect from the receipt i had online, hard to prove over the phone because they kept referring to the receipt, very very rude customer service... If Pizza Hut could actually see my online order n the receipt this location gave me, they r both completely different! Papa John's next time"}
{"text":"Had a taste for pizza after a movie, this spot was close, and Pizza Hut has always been my favorite chain pizza. Walked in and was immediately greated by Elizabeth on the register. Super friendly and personable. Made ordering easy! We dined in and she brought us the pizza just like e ordered it. Checked in us a few times, and was exactly the same with every other customer who walked in. And the pizza was wonderful. Hot and cheesy. Not disappointed with anything."}
{"text":"We got take out this past Sunday and by Monday morning  everyone was sick .Don't know if it was the flu or a bad  bug but it was bad. Just now getting over it!!  It was miserable"}
{"text":"The service here is terrible I gave them a chance 3 times. The 3rd time they forgot my order so I cancelled but they still charged me for my drinks after I asked for a refund because I was waiting 30 min.
Every time I go it's some white kid with a lot of gang tattoos that could care less about customer service. I wish management would drug test all their employees since they all smoke by back doors then make YOUR pizza. Don't come here unless you like druggie hate Mongols making your pizza."}
{"text":"My experience at this Pizza Hut has been good.  I order takeout and pickup in the drive through on my way home.  They always get the order right and always have it ready on time.  The only reason I give 4 stars is it is pretty much just regular pizza to me, nothing really special."}
{"text":"It is a good pizza place, quite cheap and handy for taking out of pizza. The waiter is very nice. It a worth place to return."}
{"text":"Poor customer service, would not adhere to my dietary restrictions. Illogical explanation, apparently the oven will blow up if you substitute for vegetarian toppings. Just go to the Hurontario and Eglinton Pizza Hut, customer service is much better there."}
{"text":"I made a delivery order last night to a vape shop.The delivery guy seemed to be so uncomfortable with the ambiance.I asked him if he's okay,and he's like uhm no,I wish they turn on the exhaust here or somewhere.I understand that but dude  its a freaking vape shop.When I gave him cash for the payment,he didn't even bother asking me if I want my change,he just left.That was just rude."}
{"text":"Pizza is perfect. So many flavors to choose from juat in sauses. Dont get me started on the cruat options. Not expensive and friendly service."}
{"text":"This is the second time in a row I've placed an order at this location and when I got there they said the pizza was lost and were making a new one. All this after I sat waiting already for 15 minutes  when the girl said it would be 5. Terrible customer service! Pizza Hut you should be ashamed!"}
{"text":"I order from here all the time. Fast to make my food, always incredibly delicious. The store is pickup only (no place to dine in) but it is clean and well lit. Staff are prompt. There are over a dozen pizza places within a mile from this store but I prefer this pizza over any of the other ones."}
{"text":"This Pizza Hut used to offer buffets at lunch time (not sure if they still do), and although it sounds like good, clean pizza fun for $12 or so, it isn't. For whatever reason, Pizza Hut feels they don't have to make quality pizza for the buffet. They don't put as many toppings on and the crust seems to be made of cardboard. There's also a weird chemical taste, which troubles me.

Anyway, they guys have to smarten up. Even their expensive pizza isn't as good as it used to be (skimping on ingredients again). I think a lot of people have already given up on the place and I have too."}
{"text":"Recently moved to York SC and I ordered my first Pizza from the store in Lake Wylie. I ordered their 7.99 special promoting the new oven in the car. When the pizza arrived it was cold and had to be reheated. I ordered a pan pizza and got hand tossed. In addition, I asked for extra sauce on the pizza and it was dry as a bone. Will not order from this pizza hut again. On a positive note, the driver was very cordial."}
{"text":"This restaurant is one of good choice if you are looking for not so expensive pizza and wings with a good taste. Very convenient and rarely a problem to get great tasting food from. We order from here a ton when having a party or get together with friends and family."}
{"text":"Have been eating Pizza Hut for for over 50 years. I've ordered from this location 5 or 6 times. It has never been good but last night was the end. Ordered 2 large supreme pizzas for 6 people and we didn't even finish the first one. There was very little sauce and almost no cheese. Threw the second one in the garbage where the whole order belonged. This location needs to be closed"}
{"text":"Second time I order from this pizza hit online and they say I dont have your order its a disgrace , I lived around the corner thinking they my neighborhood pizza hut ans they always come up with excuses poor customer service . When i have proof of the order in my email comon get your stuff together."}
{"text":"I made an order online and they managed to still messed up my order. Looking at the fact that its all written right in front of them. Worst part is they wouldn't admit it that they made a error and was just being a total jerk. Worst customer service experience ever."}
{"text":"So sorry to say, but I've never seen a place cheap out on toppings more than this place. I bought a large \"Pepperoni Lovers\" pizza thinking it would be twice the pepperoni, but no. We're talking 1-2 pieces of pepperoni per slice. The pizza was mostly crust. I brought it back in to show the owner, but he insisted the pizza had enough pepperoni with \"26 slices.\" Huh. Disappointing."}
{"text":"Love It Here :) & Not Just Saying That Cause I am a previous worker, I love the manager, heart of gold & all the long time great employees make you feel lovely :) great for dine in as well as good for carry out due to their pick up window in bad or cold weather! Check it out!"}
{"text":"I ordered a large. All mushrooms. Half with pepperoni and half pineapple. They made my pizza wrong. They offered to fix it. And they still made it wrong."}
{"text":"This place is shit.  Do NOT order from them.  We put an order in for our pizza and it came raw.  It was still doughy...I could have taken the whole top half of that pizza and made myself a dozen cookies. After 10 minutes, my daughter complained of a stomach ache and had an allergic reaction to something in the pizza.  Will NEVER EVER order from here again.  They need to shut this place down."}
{"text":"This Pizza Hut is the best Pizza Hut in town! I don't know why but it is! I've never gotten a bad pizza from this particular place! The pizza is always great, taste is phonomnial and the people are nice! I live in concord but I don't mind driving to kannapolis for a great tasting pizza! Love the pan cheese pizza ! Are there the other day!!"}
{"text":"Not so great any more! Used to be my favorite but now it's not that great tasting! They tell me I don't know why we have all the same ingredients as the other pizza huts but That may be true but something has changed the taste of the pizzas! Now I've already got banned from delivery for expressing my opinion which is in my book is totally bullcrap because what's with the customer hotline on the back of the receipt if we can't express our opinion if there just going to punish me for it! I guess it's because I'm the only one who tells the truth! The only good thing is the Cheese sticks and choc Dunkers!! It's weird because this is the only Pizza Hut that is like this! I've been around Pizza Hut since I was 16 I even worked for them in KP! If they don't want me to express my opinion then don't put up your ad on websites like these!!"}
{"text":"OK-I realize this should not be a surprise.  But, in a stupor of holiday exhaustion, I ordered a Pan-Normous pizza for me and my kids.  My children, apparently already slaves to advertising, REALLY wanted to try it.  It turned out to be a good education for the difference between what something looks like on TV, versus real life.  ( I am sure there is a deep life lesson here, but I was too irritated to take advantage of it)  There was nothing enormous about the pizza, which is my main complaint.  I asked the guy on the phone how many people it would feed, he said 8.  Ummm-8 tiny people.  It was also, not good, but again, not surpised at that.  So I think I will be thankful that now my kids know how gross Pizza Hut is too."}
{"text":"I had a horrible experience with their gluten free pizza. They had no clue what toppings were gluten free.  They said bacon was gf but bacon crumble was not gf. Then they bring the gf pizza with the bacon crumble and we did not realize it was crumble until after the fact. Manager says only their crust is gf and has no clue about gf.  This is unacceptable and irresponsibile. To boot she was demeaning and inconsiderate of the potential health risk. I would give them a zero"}
{"text":"If you want your order to be correct, call another franchise. They do not listen, forget to include the additional items in the delivery, but NEVER forget to charge you for them! We ordered 2 Pizzones, only one came, then the \"manager\" (I'll use the term loosely) gave us attitude when we called back to complain. She had the Pizzone redelivered, AN HOUR LATER, without so much as an apology!! I hate hate hate this Pizza Hut!"}
{"text":"I've never had any problems when ordering from this location until today. As I'm waiting to pick up my order the lady in front of me was a little upset that someone's pizza was just sitting on the counter not even boxed up. She stood there for a good 5 mins before anyone acknowledged her. Finally someone in the back came up to help. She told the worker, I hope that's not my pizza that's been sitting there all this time. The worker gave her attitude & said, I just cut it. And I'm looking at her & thinking, no you didn't just cut it cause it was already sitting there when I walked in. And I have no idea how long it's been sitting there. The worker gives more attitude & says did you want me to make another one, lady looks at her & says no, I'll just call corporate. Then worker says why do you have to call corporate for, lady says because it's not right for someone's pizza to be just sitting there not boxed up. Then I noticed a container of chicken wings on the counter & thinking to myself, that better not be my chicken wings. Asked the lady in front of me, how long do you think that has been sitting there? She tells me since I walked in that door it was there. And me hoping it wasn't mine because I would've been really upset. Then finally another worker asked the other worker, where does the container of chicken wings go. She said in the warmer, then grabs it & puts it in the warmer. So then, I was up next to pick up my order & sure enough it was my chicken wings that was sitting there. Man... I was so mad. Told her not to be rude but how long was my chicken wings sitting there & she tells me I just made it. I told her no you didn't just make it because when I walked in, it was already sitting there & you just now put it in the warmer. By this time she was so irritated & giving attitude. I just told her that I don't appreciate the fact that it was sitting there for a long time & I walked out giving her attitude. As I walked out & I was thinking I'll be contacting corporate. Then decided to turn around & catch her name. Never again am I ordering from this location. I wonder how many customers order from here & the pizza, chicken wings, breadsticks, etc. just sits there. Bad customer service. Btw... The workers name is Alexandria. Well that's what she told me, hope it's a real name."}
{"text":"Pizza Hut has, with its' specialty pizzas (piggy, etc) & specialty crusts ( pretzel, bacon stuffed, etc.) become the absolute BEST, GO-TO pizza shop!  Had that piggy one with spinach, mushroom, pretzel crust, balsamic - can't wait to try sriacha & the others.  Subsequently tried a Marcos Specialty ( which I had previously liked) and was disappointed - knew then it was Pizza Hut that had spoiled me for great pizza"}
{"text":"DISGUSTING FOOD! I ordered a vegetarian pizza from here and found a piece of pork on my pizza it was disgusting!!! I only discovered it because my daughter hates tomato so I was removing all the tomatoes and noticed that this piece didn't look like a tomato but more like A piece of meat and I was right. OMG if we would have accidentally ate that pork I would have died! I will never eat Pizza Hut again."}
{"text":"My experience as a customer who orders delivery from this store:


I love their pizza, garlic bread w/cheese and wings w/buffalo hot sauce BUT:

They often screw up my order, usually one of:

1. I ordered a garlic bread with cheese and they forgot the marinara dip cub
2. I ordered a garlic bread with cheese but only got plain garlic bread instead
3. They'll switch my 2L for cans because they ran out of 2L bottles but they only bring 4 cans (4x355 = 1.420L)
4. There's wings missing from the wing box


Add to everything I said above the fact that the same order I placed this week was also ordered in May but my most recent order was 10% more expensive. 

The only positive thing I can say (other than i find their food delicious) is whenever I call the store they'll make it right and give me a credit but honestly, I'd rather just get the correct order right from the start, I don't understand why it's so difficult for them to do so.  I'm at a point where whenever the delivery guy comes to my door I have to open all the boxes to count and make sure everything is as it should be.  If they didn't screw up my order so often, I might order more often than once every few months."}
{"text":"I ordered from them for delivery. They went to the wrong address. They were extremely rude when I was on the phone with them...first a girl and then the delivery driver. The driver would not pass me to the manager. I called Domino's."}
{"text":"While this is just a run of the mill Pizza Hut, it's one of the very few that offers the Pizza Buffet for lunch. All you can eat for a very reasonable price.  If you're looking for a filling lunch, you really can't beat this place.  Clean, close Ross Park Mall."}
{"text":"This is by far the best Pizza Hut place that I've ordered carryout from. I came in there and Shehad met me my my son with such a genuine smile. She advise us of the promotion that they were having and we ended up getting a lare pizza plus additional chicken wings.  She was just so kind and sincerely wanted to help us. When the order came out, she made sure we were happy with how the chicken wings looked as well as the pizza. I go to a lot of pizza joints and it's really rare to see such great customer service.  I give Shehad and this Fort Apache Pizza Hut place 5 happy stars!  We will definitely be coming back here again:)"}
{"text":"I keep trying to give this place a chance. Everytime I do, I end up SO MAD at myself. Do not spend your hard earned money at this location. They are such a joke it literally feels like you're in the twilight zone....could quality/customer service really be this bad?? Am I getting punked?? It's obscene."}
{"text":"2/20/2011 - They were great today. My online order was wrong - they made another pizza, delivered it to my house, and took the wrong one to give to charity"}
{"text":"I cant imagine a chain that is so poorly run, but it is.  I have never had a delivery order without either a mistake in my order or a half raw pizza crust.  Wait times are insane, the staff not helpful at all for any reason.  Last time I called for delivery they forgot to put my order in period and then discounted me 20% for my trouble, as if that makes up for a 90 minute wait time.  While I prefer Pizza hutt pizza in general, I would much rather go to Domino's or Papa John's because it really is unbearable."}
{"text":"TERRIBLE service! We ordered our pizza online and when we got it it was completely wrong no stuffed crust no crust flavor! So we called and spoke to Paul who said they would make us another one free of charge ok cool... fast forward 30 minutes later and they gave us a burnt ass pizza with crush harder than a rock! No standards!! Will never be ordering from this location EVER again"}
{"text":"Gateway,  Kannapolis. 

Staff very friendly and helpful.

Ordered online and went in for pickup, so I cannot say about the ordering process on site. Had my order correct, so that's an improvement over many Pizza Huts.

Ordered a large ground beef and mushroom hand tossed crust with the balsamic accent.  Very very good for chain store pizza!"}
{"text":"Ordered the special 2 med for 6.99 each. 1 was supposed to be half olive and half cheese. They put olives on all of it. Asked them to just do the 2nd pizza. Charged me $12 for 1 medium pizza. No thank you. I'll take my business to someone who can make what I order. The entire time they were looking at each other confused. Rude people."}
{"text":"Terrible. Instead of contacting the customer for more clarification on how to find the location on delivery, they just cancel the order and wait until we call to find out... Awesome. 

**managed to still mess up the order second time around. Don't go here. Terrible service and terrible staff."}
{"text":"I'm always ordering from this place and only had one problem the cheese wasn't melted all the way but I noticed they were super busy other than that the pizza is always delicious, the wings are perfect and the staff is always friendly."}
{"text":"This is my local Pizza Hut location. Unfortunately, it is the worst. My orders are constantly wrong, or my food arrives smashed or old. I know what hours old pizza looks like, and that's what this location provides. I'm rarely happy, rarely get what I ordered, and almost always regret using this location."}
{"text":"Ordered cheesy bites pepperoni pizza, boneless wings, side of ranch and side of marinara. When it came I got dry ass pizza, ok wings, ICING instead of ranch (learn to read people) and watery ass \"pizza sauce\" pretty sure it was piss water."}
{"text":"I ordered a 10 dollar box from this location they didn't even put the marinara sauce or the icing for the cinnamon sticks in the box. Needless to say my Brother and his friend had to eat it all dry. This wasn't the first time something like this has happened with this Pizza Hut. It's very disappointing."}
{"text":"I ordered pizza and wings online. When I arrived I quickly realized the manager was the only one working and orders were piling up. My order wasn't even started. The worst part is that he was not wearing gloves. Just sticking his hands in the cheese and throwing it on pizza! He then would handle money and answer the phone. Yuck!"}

{"text":"Mixed emotions; I've always loved Pizza Hut and this store does a really good job of being fast, getting the order right, and the drivers are always helpful and nice.  The quality is usually good and the food gets here hot.  Being single, I order way more pizza than I'd want to admit (who wants to cook for one, anyway?)  But this week I was sick, stuck at home and ordered 3 times in the last 7 days.  Not one time was there a \"deal\" available for one pizza or pizza/wing -  except for that weird new pizza type that looks bizarre.  Why are there 7 deals for groups or families, but nothing for just one (or two ) people?  I ended up ordering off the regular menu, got a large 3 topping and 6 wings.  By the time fees and taxes were added, it costs $23.00 without counting the tip I'll pay. I don't mind paying for what I want or good quality, but c'mon - they  can offer SEVEN deals for 2 or more pizzas, but nothing for one?  I went on and ordered but looked up some neighborhood alternatives (Naked City, Napoli) that deliver, and next time I'm calling one of them instead.  If PH shows no caring or loyalty to ALL its customers, then why should this single gal continue my loyalty to them?"}
{"text":"Overall great Pizza Hut. Nice staff. Although I did have to wait one time for a few minutes for the worker in the back to get off of his cell phone to notice me at the front counter, but other than that I've only had positive experiences. The pizzas turn out great from this location every time!"}

{"text":"I feel bad for the workers here, working under poor management. I never had a problem here before, and when i do, the Manager in charge is a smart ass. 
..So, i ordered 2 pizzas (online).. one with vegetables and bacon, the other with pepperoni and italian sausage. One was perfect, the other was totally wrong.  I'm an understanding person. I wasn't mad.. Things happen. 
I decided to call and speak with the manager. He ask for my phone number, to pull up my order (Im thinking to get a better understanding) and as I'm explaining to him that one of my pizzas came out perfect..and the other one was totally wrong, that i didn't get sausage and pepperoni.. He cuts me off and tells me to be more specific and ask me the thin crust or the thick crust? So, i answer him, but, thinking to myself i thought i was being specific. Anyhow, he fixed my mistake by telling me that he was just gonna remake my order. so i tell him ok, thank you and sorry for your inconvenience. He replies to me ok.  I shouldn't have been the one to apologize.  Last time i checked, it was their mistake, not mine. How do you messed up an online order, anyways?? I should've received a quick apology for the mistake that his store made and especially for my inconvenience.
Beside that i love pizza Hut. 5 stars to you guys. 2 stars to the smart ass fixing the problem.  Management needs to be a little more professional, here.

{"text":"It was a night where proceeds go to a local school so that's a good start. Our cashier was super friendly, food was good (love that this location has siracha). What was really cool was when an obviously homeless man scored some pizza, the manger Armando politely offered to box the guy's pizza but he had to leave.  He was nice but firm and made the patrons feel safe.  Good job!"}
{"text":"Awesome place we really missed Pizza Hut in Georgetown now that it's back we can enjoy the delicious pizza in town great staff and great food quality better then the old one"}
{"text":"Terrible service and filthy restaurant.   Needs a bulldozer to clean up the place puts it's remaining employees out of their misery."}
{"text":"The Pizza Hut lunch buffet has been a North Kannapolis staple for many years. It's a great way to grab a quick filling lunch with a variety of pizza, pasta and salad.

My last experience I expected to be less than perfect, but turned out to be very satisfactory after all. I arrived about 20 minutes before the close of the lunch buffet, expecting to find a small assortment of leftovers to choose from. I was pleasantly surprised to find plenty of good fresh pizza there ready to choose from."}
{"text":"I haven't had pizza hut in years and will most likely never eat it again after the horrible service and the complete lack of competence from their employees. I waited at the counter for about 10 minutes before I received any service. 
Not only did they make my first pizza incorrectly, they made my SECOND pizza incorrectly. As I was waiting for my pizza to be remade-after already driving home with it and having to come back, I arrive to their location over hearing someone calling to complain about their incorrect delivery order. Not to mention they proudly hang a \"B\" from the health department on their wall, anyone who has worked in a kitchen knows that this is nothing to be proud of. Way to go pizza hut Durango, you're a bunch of winners."}
{"text":"Sent email saying pizza was on its way.  Got pizza 40 minutes later.  It was cold, and not good.  I love pizza hut, but this was disgusting.  The box was gross from where pizza had sit for so long."}
{"text":"Driver was 30 minutes late, paid for 2 ranch dipping sauce. I only got one. Ordered 8 boneless wings & 8 traditional wings & both were boneless. They at least put BBQ drizzle on my pizza."}
{"text":"The pizza was great. Service was good, but they were very, very understaffed. We had to wait over an hour for our food. They did adjust our bill down."}
{"text":"Got sold by the commercial for crunchy cheesy bites pizza.  As low as my expectations for this chain were, they still managed to disappoint by not being crunchy.  The pizza sauce and toppings were okay, but more expensive than Pizza 3000 down the road."}
{"text":"Delivery time was 11:30. Called at 12 to check on my order and was told it was just going in the oven and would be another 45 minutes to an hour until it was delivered. Told them to just cancel the order. And they got an attitude with me about it. Not to mention in the past they couldn't even bring me my entire order."}
{"text":"Thought i'd give Pizza Hut a shot after not ordering form there for a number of years. We just moved into a neighborhood close to this location...BAD IDEA! I totally forgot the complete lack of value that exists in this business. I paid $34 for a pizza (had missing ingredients on 1/3rd of it), wings and potato wedges. In an area that also has Sophie's Pizza if find it hard to comprehend how this establishment retains any consumer loyalty. NEVER AGAIN will i allow their marketing engine to fool me...they should be ashamed."}
{"text":"I second the review by Grace C. My family and I waited a long time even tho it was just after lunchtime on a weekday. We waited and waited and waited and waited... We finally looked around and noticed the staff and our waitress were outside talking on their phones. Around 40 min. later (remember - the place is empty) our pizza arrives. Pizza Hut pizza itself if fair but this particular location's staff  is just abysmal. Also, the location on campus in Champaign no longer offers a soda fountain and charges outrageous prices for 20 oz. drinks. No free refills. Adios, Pizza Hut..."}
{"text":"iI love this pizza hut they're always happy to help me with anything and always give me the best pizza exactly how I like it!  I live just down the street and have named this top of NY list for convenience service and great food. :)"}
{"text":"We usually order from this location- the big box meal with the pizza, cheese sticks, and wings. I the pizza used to be made a lot better...  there are toppings but little to no sauce; kind of a disappointment. We love hot wings but it is always hit or miss with the wings at this location. We always need to cut them open so we know they are cooked all the way... We usually end up not being able to eat 3 or 4 each time we order. It's a waste of money sometimes but I can always count on the estimated 'ready' time. ... Eh."}
{"text":"Wish there was an option for zero stars. I haven't been to a pizza hut for a few years but I had fond memories of it as a child so I decided to stop in and grab a quick bite before work.

Absolute worst customer service I think I've ever had. The woman working the register came off as though me walking in was a chore. Her body language and tone of voice were so off putting that it completely put me off to the place, but I was still hoping that the food would be worth it, absolutely not. Personal pan pizzas are a joke. You can definitely get more for your dollar at so many other places, like little caesers. 

When the lady came out to give me my food she said here you go, turned around and walked away. I said \"thanks, have a good one\" and she straight up ignored me. Will never return."}

{"text":"This location is very disappointing to me. I ordered a pizza and hot wings for delivery. The delivery was on time but the pizza was disgusting and uncooked. The cheese wasn't even melted. It grossed me out . The money I paid was not worth the $30.  I would rather the delivery be a little late than have uncooked pizza. They lost a customer"}
{"text":"Food was ready on time and the quality was up to standard, but when I got there, they had difficulty finding my order even though I had spoken with someone just minutes earlier. Hey, it's mostly teenage kids just trying to make a little bit of money, so you can't get too upset by their lack of organization. Will still give them another shot for when I've got a craving for super salty, cheap pizza."}
{"text":"I live in the area and often eat here. But recently they have changed management and staff and have to say I am incredibly disappointed with the service.

The new manager is some young guy who's ego is way bigger than it should be. and the server had a bad attitude and didn't do a good at replenishing drinks or cleaning tables. 

Went for the lunch buffet  when it first started and there was no selection. All pizza was old and cold. Very very disappointing."}
{"text":"1 star is too much to rate this place. I understand during peak hours they can get busy but no matter what day of the week or what time of day i would place an order for delivery they would always take at LEAST an hour to get to my house (I live a 2 minute drive away from them). One time i ordered from there and 2 hours went by which was annoying but pretty typical so i didnt think much of it. Then the manager called me and said the driver's car broke down on the way from his last delivery so they had to cancel my order because they were about to close for the night. He didnt even offer a voucher or anything. Just refunded my money, said sorry, and hung up. It was late at night, other stores were now closing too, we didnt have groceries in the house, and my whole family was really hungry. This place treats their customers like garbage, we have never ordered from there since, and we never will!"}
{"text":"Management has changed and over the last couple of months it has become A-mazing!! Service is super nice and it actually looks cleaner than it used to be, it takes less than 15 minutes to make a pizza out of scratch and wings only take 10 minutes, there's also pasta, dessert, and drinks. It has a great family friendly feel and it feels a lot like a restuarant!"}
{"text":"Easy fast online ordering and pizza was right out of the oven when they said it would be!"}
{"text":"my usual place where i pick up my pizza and wings. (right next to the gym i work out....LOL!!!)

very friendly and i simply love the BONE IN Spicy BBQ wings!!!!

 if you love really HOT wings, then try them there.... believe me they are more than BURNING HOT!!! awesome."}
{"text":"I ordered 2 pizzas one hand tossed the other thin. When my pizza was delivered it was cold and specifically what I asked them not to do to my pizza they did exactly that... My pizza had no sauce and barley any cheese the crust was in comparison to eating a saltine cracker with pepperoni. When I called to voice my distaste I was offered a $10 dollar credit for a $40 order. My family and I consumed 4 slices (one a piece) & was willing to drive the pizza back. Not only was I not offered a full refund or an apology I was told by the manager she could only do a $10 refund when I told her that was unsatisfactory she then went up $5 and said she could do no more. At the least they should've replaced the order at no charge. I now understand why they have only 3 stars out of 8 reviews. Quality and customer satisfaction is lacking and as a franchise store I would expect more from their brand. Lost a customer"}
{"text":"A few days ago, I ordered a pizza online and picked it up from this location. When I was given the receipt & asked to sign, I noticed that instead of the usual blank tip line (where you can add a tip if you want to), the cashier had already added a $5 tip on the computer before printing out the receipt. I asked her what was going on because that's never happened before, at this location (with other cashiers) or any other Pizza Hut location I've been to lately and this woman tried to act like she had no idea how the $5 tip appeared on the receipt. I explained to her that the reason I pick-up my pizza is so I don't have to leave a tip and told her to issue a $5 refund immediately. She did. However, this experience left a bad taste in my mouth and I will no longer go to this location. It's sad that people try to steal your money if they think they can get away with it. Had I not checked the receipt before signing, I never would have noticed what she did. And I know it was this woman who entered the $5 tip on the computer before printing it since I've been to this location before and usually, the tip line is blank so you can add a tip if you want to. I guess some cashiers think customers are in a rush and won't notice the added tip until it's too late. Always check the receipt before signing and leaving. I won't be going back to this location. Dishonest cashier and the pizza was average at best, with the woman forgetting to add BBQ sauce. I had ordered only 1 pizza....how hard is it to get the order right?"}
{"text":"The last two times I've ordered from this location, I've ordered cheese sticks and pizza. Instead of cheese sticks, they've given me breadsticks each time. The first time, didn't really pay attention as I was in a rush and only noticed when I got home. However, the second time, when the guy opened the box to show me what I had ordered, as I was paying, I noticed the difference right away and actually asked him if those were indeed cheese sticks in the box because there was no cheese anywhere and the whole thing looked extremely dry. He lied and said 'they are cheese sticks, like you asked for'. But I was far from convinced. So, I decided to try another Pizza Hut location a few days later and at that location, the cheese sticks were definitely cheese sticks. These cheese sticks also looked identical to the ones in the pics on the Pizza Hut website. So, the guys at the Cheyenne Ave location are basically lying to some of their paying customers and not giving us what we ordered and paid for. Their pizzas are also often dry and have hardly any sauce on them. I was going to this location because it's very close to where I live, however, I'd rather drive a few extra miles and get better pizza and honest employees."}

{"text":"My kids love the buffet, mostly for the desserts, but do like the pizza too.  I don't like the pizza much but between that and the salad it will satisfy me.  It is a really good deal for kids and fair for adults.  It is nice that they will do some special pizzas for you and bring by your table before putting out on the buffet."}
{"text":"A couple of days ago my husband ordered a medium thin crust pepperoni pizza and some wings... I was upset because I LOVE thin crust and didn't know he ordered it. He began to tell me how I want missing out because the pizza was terrible. And I thought hmm mauve is because he prefers a different style crust. So I ordered it for myself today. Requested that it be made FRESH due to it being old the lady time. She told me out would take 1 hour for delivery so I opted for the 20 min pick up instead. Not quite 20 mins later I was there to pick up my order of pizza and breadsticks. I could tell when they showed it to that it wasn't MADE 20 mins ago. It had been SITTING since 20 minutes ago. I asked when it came out, the guy shrugs and says \"I don't know like 5 minutes ago\" . I say screw it and come home. My pizza is dry, over cooked, NO SAUCE WHATSOEVER and burned crust. Not to mention, I have to warm up ALL of my food, breadsticks included, and I only live 4 minutes away, with traffic . Needless to say, they'll be hearing from me. I would never wat this food again, even if it were free. In fact, I'd pay you to keep it  I'm PISSED because I've wasted my time, money and gas and STILL had to go to McDonald's. To be such a huge chain, y'all can AFFORD to do better. Maybe if you weren't sitting around picking your nose behind the register you could make a decent pizza."}
{"text":"This place is nasty and the managers are the rudest people I've ever seen in a store.   One of them started yelling at a girl who worked there right in front of the customers. Don't order from here! You'll get food poisoning."}
{"text":"Terrible customer service and cold pizza.  Called manager for assistance on online ordering for 2 large pizzas and was sent 2 mediums instead she argued with me that I ordered medium.  Location is 6370 W Flamingo Rd. Las Vegas, NV 89103.  Location doesn't even qualify for 1 star."}
{"text":"Three trips and three hours later, we finally got our complete and correct order. They were somewhat nice about it. Things did sound hectic (not my problem) We ordered two large pizzas. Ninty minutes later, the delivery rep. showed up with one pizza, not two. And it was room temperature. A call to the manager got us two more pizzas in about 70 minuted. (they took the first; good riddance), Again the pizzas were not even lukewarm and had incorrect toppings (We kept one, as our company was hungry out-of-towners. Finally, after three hours we received the second pie, a hot, correct-topping pizza. These were not coupon cheapies, but full-price pizzas. I did request a free two-liter cola for our trouble, as we had guests. There are many pizza shops in this area, and I believe one of them  (we'll find it eventually) will earn our business. So, after more than 50 years of eating Pizza Hut pizza, I bid them a not-so-fond farewell."}
{"text":"Been here before a couple of times but in the past ordered ovet the phone and either got delivery or picked up myself. 
This time around, i placed order while in the restaurant. They told me 15 minutes wait, and here i am waiting way over 15 minutes and it is not even that busy. Well i am lying, it took 18 minutes. Big deal. 

Person who took the order was polite too. 
I am cutting the star because the pizza hut price in Canada is significantly more than what they charge in US."}
{"text":"Never been a huge fan of pizza hut in general but for 6 dollars for any toppings on a medium pizza I thought I'd give it  a shot. When I placed my order for pick up online it gave me a count down to suggest my order would be ready in 15 minutes or less. My pick up time was 6:22 and when I arrived just on time it wasnt quite done. I had ordered extra dipping cups of marinara sauce expecting to pay extra for but the cashier comped them for having to wait an extra 3 minutes for my pizza to be ready. Excellent customer service even though I wasnt upset at the time overage. Thats how you keep customers. Food was, hot accurate and surprisingly tasty for the price."}
{"text":"I travel a lot for work and tend to order from Pizza Hut often. It's convenient and the food is decent so it gets the job done. I've never really had a bad experience with Pizza Hut until this particular time. I placed my order through the mobile site for delivery and within about 5 minutes, I received a phone call from the store. I had ordered the \"big dinner box\" with 2 pizzas, breadsticks, and chicken wings. The conversation started out with the worker telling me they didn't have any sauce for the breadsticks. Totally cool, I can do without the marinara sauce, throw some extra ranch in there and everything is good. Then the worker proceeded to tell me that they didn't have any boxes for the \"big dinner\" special. The size or shape of the box doesn't make the pizza taste any worse or better. I told the worker it didn't matter to me, throw it all in a regular box. At this point the worker told me to please hold because she needed to speak to her manager. This was weird to me because why would you need to speak to a manager about a pizza box size? Anyways, the worker returned to the phone and told me that they didn't have the right cooking pan to make the \"big dinner box\" special pizza. At this point I'm completely baffled by all of this and have a feeling like they aren't trying to deliver my pizza. And c'mon, your name is Pizza Hut, you can't be serious trying to tell me you don't have a certain pizza pan. So I proceeded to tell the worker to scratch the \"big dinner box\" special and give me 2 large pepperoni pizzas, with breadsticks and wings. Once again I am put on hold. Waiting patiently, and at this point, very hungry because I've been talking about pizza for the past 10 minutes. The worker returns to the phone and tells me that it's going to be about an hour and a half to 2 hour wait for my pizza to arrive. Now that feeling of them not wanting to deliver my pizza seemed most definitely real. I told them to cancel my order because I wasn't trying to eat dinner at 10 o'clock at night. I asked if I would receive an email saying the order was canceled and the worker proceeded to tell me that she didn't know and I would need to get in contact with my bank in order to verify the refund. At this point, the $43.29 just didn't seem that important anymore to figure out while I was hungry. The worker hung up without an apology for the inconvenience or anything along those lines. Very poor performance from Pizza Hut, especially since I've been an customer since I was a little kid. Two thumbs down on both customer service and food quality, since my food never existed"}
{"text":"Been ordering from this Ray Road Pizza Hut for 6 years,  usually $50-$70 per order for parties at our house.  Now, this franchise has started charging for red peppers and cheese packets.  Terrible decision.  After complaining to the manager and driver, found out it is the owner of this and 5 other Pizza Huts around Tempe/Chandler that has added this extra fee.  We now order from a distant pizza hut under different ownership and pay the driver a nice tip to avoid this Ray Road business.  What's next, a fee for the box?"}
{"text":"Rude rude rude rude rude rude, how can a general manager be so RUDE and keep her job. No wonder Pizza Hut has gotten bad reviews and ratings! They sold me someone else's order and then when mine is ready they expect me to pay for it also.....WTF! Get real people! Not even worth the one star rating we are forced to give!"}
{"text":"My order was almost 30 minutes past time it was supposed to be here. I ordered two flavors of wings and received only one. When I called to check on the status the gentleman as we will call him was instantly rude and got an attitude. I'm sorry but I paid for a meal that I expected to receive. My pizza was also cold. Bad experience all around."}
{"text":"Second visit at this location, and again disappointed. Tonight I ordered the thin & crispy crust, and it's barely eddible. The crust reminds me of a saltine cracker, only dryer. Yuck!"}
{"text":"Called an hour after my order was placed online to check on my order status. was told by the manager that he cancelled my order and credit card transaction because I had an incorrect phone number. Have previously ordered before several times. I will take my business elsewhere"}
{"text":"Worst service ever . We ordered our pizza and wings at 9:15 and they didn't deliver it until 11:15!!! What in the world . The bad part about waiting so long was the fact that our pizza was cold.. and tasted like day old pizza . After waiting so long I wouldn't have thought I would have been getting some hot cheesy pizza.. not a cold one . Never again."}
{"text":"well lats nght I did not fell like cooking so I ordered pizza. the comercials on TV had been haunting me for moths with thoese\" Pa- Zones things\" They looked good on TV but when they arived at mt house the sise was something a bit larger than A hot pocket. I had the italian meat and the buffalo they were good dont get me wrong, but i guess I got what I payed for when they are only two for five dollars. The new item pizza rollers witch you recived four per order for five dollars had pepperonni in side witch was nice. the cheese sticks how ever my dog if I had one would not even eat  not good card board yo do not get this joke of a cheese stick no real cheese just crust and powdered cheese. 

the food did come it a speedy 20 min or so, when the gut pulled out the two small boxes i thought it was a joke. next time I will just get a good extra large pizza nto from these guys. fell sucker to the smell o vision again."}
{"text":"Extremely unhappy that my pizzas were completely ruined. They were burned so bad that they crumbled like crackers. This location needs to fire their employees, they are ruining the name and reputation of Pizza Hut! I order 5 pizzas for myself and my family tonight after a long day of moving and instead of receiving what I ordered, I got large hand tossed burned crackers with remnants of sauce in some places and burned pepperoni. Not happy and will be searching out a new pizza place."}
{"text":"Oh dear lord, please avoid this place at all costs. Placed an online order only to find out I had a 160 minute wait with no other options. Drove in to pick the order up only to find chaos. All of the employees were yelling at each other,  no driver reported to work, etc. Horrible service."}
{"text":"Was staying in a upscale hotel near the Cleveland airport. Delivery person refused to bring my order to the room even tho I paid by a credit card. They called me on my cell when they arrived in the lobby. Had to meet them in the lobby to get my order. They had my order out of the bag waiting for me to show up. Food was warm but not super warm/hot. I won't be ordering from this Pizza Hut again. I've never had this type of experience before from a delivery establishment."}
{"text":"Months ago I ordered Pizza & 24 Wings. I only received 12 wings in the package. I called in to notify of the mistake. I was told they would credit me 24 wings on my next order. It was a few months later I asked about it at the store. The manager said it was only valid for 30 days. I was a manager of a Pizza Hut many years ago. I told her that as a manager we have leeway when it comes to these issues. She said, \"That was back then, it's different now.\" I couldn't believe what I just heard. It shouldn't matter if it was 7 minutes ago or 7 months, I DID NOT GET WHAT I PAID FOR! I'm thinking my choices for pizza is pretty good, Pizza Hut is now eliminated from my list."}

{"text":"Doug you Sucks! Asshole is a pretty word to use for you. DO THE EXTRA DRIVE AND TAKE YOUR BUSINESS SOMEWHERE ELSE. So when we got to this place we asked for carry out specials, because where I usually order from it has specials on large pizzas, well it happens that I don't live in this area but decided to order from this store in Desert Inn and McLeod and DOUG the manager got so bother when I asked and said that they didn't and to go and buy somewhere else REALLY! Sorry that you're are so miserable at your job."}
{"text":"They are quick. I can put in carry out order and know that it willbe ready in 15 min or less. They get the toppings and bake it right. No complaints."}
{"text":"This was such a rip off.  I ordered two medium sized pizza with THIN CRUST. Well, the crust looked like a flour TORTILLA, hard, dry and nothing like crust for pizza. Now, image that being cooked with toppings and passed off as PIZZA!!  Since its franchised, they must all be horrible.  I hope someone reads this review and pays a few dollars more, go to a REAL pizza parlor and be satisfied...H O R R I B L E....not even one star"}
{"text":"Stopped by today for the lunch buffet....Extremely poor salad bar...few veggies with few options. No onions? Pizza selection was extremely poor with only one pizza brought out at a time. Took me ten minutes to eat and I left. Will never go ther again."}
{"text":"I wish i can give this place 0 stars . They take forever to deliver and then they don't answer the phone when you call to check the status of the pizza . The employees are super rude and have horrible customer service . i will defiantly not order from this place ever again ."}
{"text":"My family and I went to order a pizza for carryout. The manager upon hearing my husband was in the military came out from the back and personally thanked him for his service. Such a genuinely friendly staff at the Rainbow location."}

I went to a Pizza Hut in Lasalle Quebec and was amazed at the pizza they served me.
I was AMAZED Ladies and Gentlemen...

{"text":"I had the worst experience ever with any pizza place. First, it starts with delivery time per the email I was told 825pm. The app even told me it was made fast forward 945pm I'm calling about my delivery . The first young lady ,  very immature and had no business answering the phone. I asked for the manager another young lady gets on and tells me the driver is on the way my order just came out the oven. About 7 mins later now after 10 pm the door rings and the driver delivers wings and soggy cold pizza. He tells us , they forgot your other order of wings. They never remade the pizza. IT WAS OVER AN HOUR OLD. I called for 20mins no one answered the phone. They screened my call!!!If it wasn't so late I would have went to the store. I will post my experience on every social media site available as this is not good service and is very disappointing !!"}
{"text":"When we we first came here I had doubts, but we still ordered. It was great from the chicken wings to the pizza and pasta. It's very roomy and cozy and we left full. Will come back soon!"}
{"text":"Came to this location accidentally, there was another Puzza Hut down the street, I was actually in a terrible mood, but as I entered the lady behind the counter and I just hit it off. Excellent conversation and the pizza was immaculate. I was very impressed.
Ordered a sausage stuff crust and it got destroyed.
I look forward to revisiting this location.

Thank you."}
{"text":"We waited 30 minutes for someone to serve us. Then the waiter had a major hard on. Then I waited another 30 minutes for my pizza, but the pizza was pretty bomb though. then I had to go get my own box from the other people working. Then the pizza box didn't even work right and we had to tie it with a straw. Also children running around screaming. #JesusCrust"}
{"text":"Worst Pizza Place in Charlotte. Consistent issues with delivery, lack of ingredients, and when I call to find out what's up a 1/4 of the time they are rude about it. I am down for always giving three tries at a place to make sure it wasn't just an \"off night\" and this place just got three strikes in a row. I've never had a Pizza Hut be this bad. The bigger issue is that I stopped ordering 8 months ago and just recently tried them again. Guess what? I get called and told it would be a 2.5hr wait because they have too many deliveries."}
{"text":"Service is always great but the quality in the food is a hit and miss, the garlic knots whooooaa over load on the seasoning... I like them but it's always too much. My pizza was also burn, I'm bummed on that. 
Pretty much the score is for the employees, not so much the food"}
{"text":"WORST Pizza Hut I have EVER been to in my entire life. Due to being in a small area I am forced to use the Pizza Hut on Pizza Hut 4048 Beechwood Blvd, Pittsburgh, PA  15217, United States. I have never had the most disrespectful, inconsiderate, & inconsistent Pizza Hut in my life. Management is even worse than the other employees. Every time I order something is incorrect, my pizza took forever to be delivered and wasn't here at the time I was quoted, & all the employees are rude. They act as if I should be lucky as to have them prepare my food. Whenever I complain, management just says \"you can contact corporate if you would like\". When I called to see why it took an hour for my pizza to be delivered I was told they were on their way and couldn't tell me how long it would take. I only live 3 mins away, by the way.  They still showed up 20 mins later. This is not how my service should be at all. From now on, I'm just going to buy from dominoes."}
{"text":"They quoted me for a 40 min delivery time. Pizza arrived 2 hours and 15 mins later. I have always been a Pizza Hut but this was the worst pizza I've ever had, and the manager was extremely unhelpful. I've always been a firm supporter of the service industry, but this manager's customer service was subpar."}
{"text":"Delivery is spot on but unfortunately the chicken and spinach pizza didn't look appealing. The spinach appeared dumped on the pizza after the the baking process, looks tacky. I don't usually order pizza hut pizza but it's close to my house. I was hoping that I wouldn't be disappointed like previous times I've ordered their pizza. It seems worth traveling to find good pizza which I will be doing from now on."}
{"text":"We ordered several pizzas online and the toppings were mixed up between them.  We called and were told they would send new ones out when they were in the area and it shouldn't be long since they were so busy from the football games.  We live a half mile from the location.  An hour goes by and then we were told they normally don't resend food out that was wrong but they will.  Another hour goes by and they kept getting more rude on the phone.  3 hours go by and we get hung up on on our next call.  We tried back after getting hung up on and were told it would be another 3 hours.  We never got our replacement food.  The customer service line was very helpful."}
{"text":"Horrible problem resolution skills by the manager of this pizza hut. That had an issue where we did not get everything we paid for and they refused to make it good.
Our thin crust pizza was horribly under cooked and was stuck to the bottom of the box. I don't give them my business anymore."}

{"text":"OK that is it we are officially done with Pizza Hut.  We ordered two large pizzas last night.  Made sure in the comments that we put well done.  We got the pizzas at exactly midnight and both were white with no browning.  What is up with the pizza places in Vegas.  Is it really that hard to get a browning on pizzas here?  Of course couldn't complain to the restaurant because they were closed.  Was a complete waste of $30.  Never ever again."}
{"text":"Lately, we have gotten good service from the manager on the phone. Tonight, we called two different times and were on hold both times for 5 minutes. It was pathetic. We hung up and called Papa John's, who didn't put us on hold at all and we got a better price.

These people really need to hire competent employees if they want business."}

My friend and I were standing in the front of our building looking for this car! As the manager had the nerve to talk down to me saying, \"maybe you should pick up your phone when we call you next time.\" Well fuck that guy. We had to wait another hour till our pizza arrived.

For a personal pan pizza that my son ordered, they made me wait more than 1 hour. Order was placed at 6:06 PM today and it should have been ready to pick up 6:40 PM according to the email from pizza hut. 
Least did I know, I will be spending more than one hour there, waiting for the little pizza, inquiring multiple time about it's readiness, and not surprisingly, watching other pick-up customers waiting in agony, bemoaning their decision to order from this miserable place. My order was finally ready and the pizza was handed over to me by an unapologetic employee, who probably was accustomed to similar incidents. A that moment I had had enough. I told them that I am never coming back to this place again but my statement made little difference to them. No wonder I wind this pizza ht with ONE STAR. It should be NEGAIVE FIVE."}

{"text":"I was in Cleveland for a conference, staying in a downtown hotel. I ordered a pizza online and promptly received a confirmation email stating a delivery time.   Fifteen minutes past that time I called to make sure everything was ok with the order. I was told the driver was running behind.  Thirty minutes after the original delivery time I received a call from the driver stating I needed to come downstairs for the pizza, which I did. I came back to my room, poured a glass of Pepsi and opened the box to find the wrong pizza, which was only lukewarm.  I called the driver and he said he didn't have any other pizzas and since I paid in cash he would have to come back with a refund. He called when he returned to let me know I had to come down with the pizza. When I showed up he said I had to return the entire order to get a refund (i had ordered a pepsi and a cookie).  Are you kidding me?  You're 30 minutes late from the time you told me, I had to call to get a status update, you brought the wrong pizza which wasn't even hot, and then after coming downstairs with the pizza I have to go back to my room to get an opened pepsi bottle and cookie box or I cant have a refund?  Are you planning on refilling the pepsi bottle? Are you going to put the cookie box back in inventory?  What a disappointing experience. No more Pizza Hut."}
{"text":"Went in 2 kids after a Saturday soccer game. They were hungry! We always think this location has closed b/c the lot is empty every time we go (rarely) but this was no exception.
We were seated quickly but it went down hill from there. We arrived and were the only customers. We ordered 3 drinks and 3 personal pans. About 15 min in, another family came in and got a pitcher of cola and when ms pizza arrived at their table, we guessed they had ordered ahead. But then 25 minutes in,no waitress, no explanation. 
When a customer came in for a pickup, the waitress took care of them just as I walked over to check on our order.
The 3 pizzas were played and sitting on the delivery rack. When I asked if she could give us our pizzas, she told me to wait (as they continued to cool). Another kitchen employee refused to even turn around to lift a finger.
When I saw another customer come in for slick up, I attempted to get our pizzas and was chastised by the employees when I pointed out they didn't appear to care about customer service.
The man I can only assume was the shift supervisor \"kindly\" reminded me I was welcome to leave, to Which my my response was to agree. Then, I left the pizzas with serving tray on the table and walked to door with my 2 hungry elementary schoolers. Employee response was not any apology or attempt to rectify their poor service to throw in \"there's the door.\" If you hate your job - leave. If you have to make excuses for your poor performance, then leave. If you can't be a people person, find a cubicle!"}

But when the driver calls and says that they are outside and your still waiting 45 min for them to find your address, which is a giant hospital building that is a well known landmark, it becomes ridiculous.  Hey how about this.  Hire competent drivers that know how to read a map or invest in your company and buy a GPS.  I guess my co-workers and I don't get to eat lunch today.  Wasted all our time calling ignorant and rude people who obviously could care less about their job."}

I order for delivery at lunch time and they call to tell me they won't have a drive until this evening? Ridiculous! At least this time they called immediately - the past few times, it was at least an hour before they called - if they called. Not even going to try to order from them again. Plenty of local non-chain places with better food that will deliver for less than half the price."}
{"text":"Normally my pizza is pretty good and normally the service is decent too. First time I ever got an undercooked pizza, not only did the cashier disappear on me. I yelled for a sold 2 min just so I can get a bag for my personal pizza. If I was a shady fuck, I could have easily robbed the place and the cashier wouldn't have known. \"Where the fuck did she go?\" I had to go to the Mac's store and get a bag for my pizza. When I got to my work, my pizza was so undercooked and the excess sauce was not called for that the cardboard box it was in was soggy and fell apart when trying to take it out of the bag. Had I not got a bag at Mac's, my pizza would have been all over in my backpack. I also question the hygiene of the staff there. I wonder if they even wash their hands. I also did not appreciate the number that is no longer in service that was given to me to make my complaint. Pizza Hut! Get your shit together."}

I  advised him that it was not my issue that the restaurant was running behind. I then told him his customer service was poor and asked for management or the phone number for survey to express my horrible experience.   That's when the associate disconnected the call.  I was shocked to be treated in such a wa after being a frequent customer at this location.  They just lost my business for good!!!!  My kids still hungry I guess I will be calling Domino's lol"}
{"text":"Extremely clean place almost too clean smelled of cleaner... Tge food was amazing but not somewhere i would go just for drinks as they cant even offer a basic bloody mary.  The loaded nacho fries werevto die fir!"}
{"text":"Called today to place a large order to send to a local business as a thank you for helping us out.  Spoke to Jeff who worked out an AMAZING deal with us for a group of pizzas. Then after he got my card number, he discounted it some more.  Excellent customer service and price.  The pizza was enjoyed by everyone!"}
{"text":"Ridiculous!!!  Tried to order the family box;  you get 1 topping per pizza. I wanted cheese for 1 of my pizzas, and 2 toppings on my other pizza... Said they couldn't do that. The computer wouldn't let them. I'd have to pay for the 2nd topping. Does that even make sense?  Now they aren't getting my $25 order!!!  All for a topping!!!"}
{"text":"Found a piece of wood in my pizza.  No apology from restaurant manager.  Filed a formal complaint with the corporate office but have yet to receive a response.  Terrible service."}
{"text":"I really do not know why people purchase pizza delivery, and or carry-out pizza anymore (myself included). 

This is Calgary, and unfortunately we pay much too high prices for too poor quality, and customer service."}
{"text":"Ordered 2 pizzas for delivery both were cold ordered Saturday night . Called the store and a supervisor lady was very rude didn't know how to talk to customers ,would never recommend this branch to anybody"}
{"text":"They don't want your business so if you call don't be surprised if you are put on perpetual hold. They will not pick up. Must be sorely understaffed. I am sure the food must be okay since it's Pizza Hut."}
{"text":"This is the closest pizza place by my house in southern highlands don't get me wrong i love Pizza Hut but lately It seems as if they don't love for the last few orders something has always been wrong three slices of pizza missing toppings or forgotten. No paper plates no napkins or the side of jalapeños that I order and pay for every time  spoke with Jeremy the general manager there and he fix the situation for the time being but a quick fix/free pizza isn't going to make it better I just won't it right the first time"}
{"text":"If you'd like some heartburn with a side of horrible customer service. Then I highly recommend you stop on by. Only reason they are getting two starts and not one is because there buffalo wings are mediocre at best."}
{"text":"Ordered the breadstick pizza .. Received expired marinara ..  I love marinara so I always spread a whole cup of marinara on pizza .. Called to complain . Oscar the manager so called said . That's how the marinara tasted .. I got a credit .. With attitude lost my business for ever. Or at least this location . He needs to no that the customer is always right . And not to argue with paying guest . Then he had the nerve to tell me to try all the food and sauces before I leave , and put a signature on a receipt .. He sucks ."}
{"text":"Bad staff and the food is not clean and I'm not happy and you wait to much for delivery"}
{"text":"This place has crappy customer service. They forgot part of our order from tonight. When we called to get it corrected the manager was rude and unhelpful."}
{"text":"I have ordered pizza here at least 20 times... I wouldn't trust the employees with my address so I always get carryout. They kinda all look shady but this shady employees always get my order right."}
{"text":"I want to start by saying the delivery girl was very nice and kind and very apologetic for being late.

Now I don't understand why a pizza place located 1 mile away from where I live takes almost an hour to deliver pizza, although she was nice about being late she never gave me a reason. 

To top that off the pizza was semi cold and very very greasy and just didn't taste all that good, I would order from here only if other places."}
{"text":"This place doesn't even deserve a 1 star. Placed my order at 414 for a 6pm delivery, Called the store at 630 to check on order. Was told their was a mix up with my order and that it was leaving the store now. Had a call back about 5 minutes after that that said my card had been declined when my order was placed therefore my order was not coming. When asked why nobody tried to contact me was told by the manager Steve that one worker and multiple drivers tried calling me, untrue first of all, and second if my card declined when I placed my order why on earth would multiple drivers be trying to call me if it never left the store. Horrible customer service and they definately dropped the ball. Steve the manager has no handle on his crew or the slightest clue what his workers are telling customers. Will never recommend nor give this restaurant another go."}
{"text":"This place has really gone to crap lately.  Sorry, I can't think of a better word to use.  The last time I ordered from here, one of my pizzas was made completely wrong.  Normally, I wouldn't care, but they didn't even put jalapenos on it.  How dare they forget the jalapenos?? That's why I order pizza.  When I called to address the issue, this was the jist of the conversation:
\"Hello, I was just calling because one of my pizzas was made wrong.\" I gave him my name and number. 
\"Oh yeah, that really complicated order.  I'm pretty sure I made it right.  What was wrong with it?\"
I explained to him what was wrong (two ingredients were missing, and there were two extra ingredients that weren't ordered)
\"Ok.  Well it's our policy to remake it. Do you want a credit or do you want us to remake it right now?\" No apology, nothing.
\"I'd prefer it remade .\"
\"Ok, so how do you want us to make it?\"
\"Uhh, I wanted it made the way I ordered it.\" 
\"I CAN'T pull up your order so you need to tell me how you want it made.\" 
After explaining how I wanted it made, he told me it'd be ready in 15 minutes.  I asked if he wanted me to bring the pizza that was made wrong, \"NO, that's against our policy.\" *dial tone*
Whatever, dude.
My brother went to go pick it up and the guy was still rude to him in person. He still insisted he had made it right because he had \"cut it\" himself.
This is an employee that is frequently at this location, and therefore I will not order from here again.  I'm not dealing with that attitude, and I don't understand how these type of people work in customer service.  Like really, you're being a douche about making pizza? Get over yourself."}
{"text":"My order of delivery comes from this pizza hut, and I have been always satisfied with service and quality. Pizzas arrive somewhat quick, and they are cooked nicely -ie not burned. They are always delicious (I love stuffed crust! Hell with diet!) But the amount they charge for delivery is crazy. You can get the same pizza at half price if you pick it up yourself."}
{"text":"If you like your pizza burned around the edges,  this is the place to go.  I ordered at the counter and told the girl I wanted extra sauce and please under cook it a little so it doesn't burn on top.  The cooks in the back completely ignored the instructions."}
{"text":"Twice I've been seduced by the commercial and what I get is not as good. Both times I've ordered extra meat but it doesn't seem like extra to me. Both times I ordered mushrooms, didn't get any. They are way too skimpy on the toppings, seriously. Even when you pay for the extras. Comes fast and hot, if you like sparsely topped pizza. Personally I think its the most barren pizza on the planet. Are all Hut's this way? Or just my location, --stingy!"}
{"text":"I only rated 1 star because I couldn't select a half or none.  Placed a delivery order at 5:30 and was told 30 minutes.  Called at 6:50 am was told it was on its way.  Called back again at 7:15 and it was not in the system anywhere and they have no record of it (after taking our credit card mind you).  

Will never order from there again and suggest you use caution as well, especially if you have young kids."}
{"text":"I don't appreciate my pizza with saggy, unbaked bread... I'm going to give them one last try this week"}
{"text":"Everytime I come to pick my order up the lady in the front is super friendly and makes sure I get what I ordered. Always on time . Really fresh the only bad thing is pizza hut is making their pizza with less bread I  have Always order hand tossed pizza and it used to be thick and good now its super thin and greasy."}
{"text":"I like Pizza Hut pizza but right now the online experience for 1086 Yonge is unacceptable!! After selecting the store nothing happens. Had to call be phone. Pizza Hut fix this as this I'll be going elsewhere next time. Very frustrating App behaves the same grrr"}
{"text":"I just spent well over half an hour attempting to simply order a god damn pizza. This is after spending 20min attempting to place my order online on a website that is shitty and doesn't work correctly. I presumably called pizza hut as in the restaurant and instead was connected to a call center where I encountered one of the most rude arrogant ignorant foreign bastards ive ever dealt with in my life. This is America and when I call a pizza place I expect to be speaking w someone at the location I have contacted. I find it absolutely ridiculous that a call center is used to simply place an order for pizza. Something that should have been very simple was instead extremely frustrating complicated and a complete and utter waste of time. Will never order from this shitty establishment again."}
{"text":"I wish I could  rank this location a zero star. I called an informed the manger of the i correction in my order and also let her know it was cold when delivered and she said, \"I'm sorry to hear that, we will work on fixing it for next time\" with the least concern imaginable. I would rather drive to Harrisburg to get my food than get it delivers by this location. It is pathetic. This isn't my first time having issues, I am a forgiving person and let things go more than often but, this time was the last time. I have had unprepared, rude and sketchy individuals show up to deliver my food and my orders be wrong many times. I will go to the Harrisburg, nc location for now on and I recommended you do too."}
{"text":"One of the best fast food experiences I've had. My roommate and I were made a cheesy bites pizza the day after they stopped selling them because the manager realized how devastated we were finding out we were a day too late, and it only took about 15 minutes! Great service."}
{"text":"Great food! I'm never disappointed. I use to switch off and on between Pizza Hut and a nearby competitor. The last visit at the other place made me regret even ordering. Needless to say I'm not bouncing back and forth anymore. So happy with our food tonight. I always get the pan because it's my favorite but the bf likes hand tossed and that didn't disappoint! Thanks! 
Ps their emailed estimated delivery time is pretty close for a Sunday night; quoted 30 arrived in 40. Not even a long wait."}
{"text":"My Family has stopped here and picked up Pizza Before and they've never really complained, so after seeing the commercial about the $10 dinner box I decided to get one of them here, upon arriving I got out of my car and smelled a horrible odor which I Figured was coming from one of the tire shops on either side (Fat Boys/Discount Tire) but upon entering the building the smell actually worsened, it smelled like stinky feet, as for the actual customer service - I have experienced much better. after sitting down and putting up with the odor, the manager (i guess) and what appeared to be other workers started lecturing another employee on how to be a better employee (the way they were talking it sounded like they were once military instructors) very disturbing even for just waiting for my order, what if i was in here having dinner with my family or something, I surely would not want to hear a lecture while I was trying to enjoy my food. upon leaving there was several employees outside texting in the reasonably small parking lot"}
{"text":"Paid with my debit card and never received my pizza! Called to speak to the manager and he was so unprofessional. I am very upset and I hope no one goes through the stress and frustration I went through.  Do not order !!!!"}
{"text":"This place is quite the experience late with order then messed it up I called the manager he said he was sorry offered me 5.00 off next order. Sorry its been over a year since I have ordered from them It will probably be 10 years this time. this is why papa johns is taking your market and you thought it was because there ingredients are fresh. good luck."}
{"text":"I placed an order and waited an hour, called them only to be told my information is wrong, they read it back to me and it was all correct. My food was cold. 

 I wrote in complaining and I got a call on a Sunday night from the manager, Tony. I thought he was calling to offer me something but it sounded like he wanted to call me to get my correct address (even though it was right) and to say it was my mistake.

I initially tried placing the order online, my password wasn't working so I called in, my order was $10 more than it was online, plus the $2 delivery fee, who charges for delivery anymore? Honestly!"}
{"text":"Tried this place a couple times, didn't get a hot pizza and it was kind of soggy on bottom both times. I decided to try them again with a Free large 1-topping pizza coupon I received. Called to order the pizza, bread sticks and their cookie pizza thing but they refused to take the coupon so I didn't order anything. This was you last chance"}
{"text":"Friendly staff. They are busy and working in the back, but they acknowledge you and make the effort. Convenient. Good is good - never been disappointed. We order here regularly"}
{"text":"Had the worse phone order experience. The employee could not process the payment and put me on hold so they could manually process the payment which is fine until i was on hold for 15 minutes without him checking in on me and after him trying the transaction twice with no success. Not only was the transaction processed 4 times, because of him, my card was put on a security hold. To make matters worse he blamed me for him being on hold that long as if he couldn't check in to at least let me know what was going on..."}
{"text":"I ordered a single pizza for delivery on Friday night at 7:30pm. Waited an hour and nothing came. I decided to give them a call to see what's up. They didn't pick up their phone, so I was routed to the Pizza Hut call centre, where I found out it was going to be a 2 hour wait. 

Normally, I'd give them the benefit of the doubt and blame it on a busy Friday night, but this is the second time its happened. The first time, when the pizza finally arrived, it was burnt, tasteless, and hardly had any toppings!"}
{"text":"So freaking slow. Food is fine but waiting on a pizza for close to an hour now and they just called to say maybe another hour and a half. I can't imagine what will show up at our door or when. I get sucked in by the specials but I should know better."}
{"text":"Best pizza with awesome service. This is a very busy location compared to other Pizza Huts I have been to in the valley so I dont mind when the Delivery time takes a little longer. I am a regular and plan to stay. I have had little issues before like a forgotten 2 liter of soda but the drivers are human and apologize and brings it right back and take it off my bill. The management handles situations very professionally and I was happy with the way this was resolved! I went to do a carry out order the other day and was made to feel welcome and received my food faster than the 15 mins quoted which was awesome! I will always come back. Dont let these other reviews scare you off by one bad experience they have had when I order atleast 2 times every month!"}
{"text":"very disappointed in the service at this pizza hut. ordered a pizza with a specific time and the delivery lady had arrived early and left before the time we asked the delivery to come. had she sat in the car for 5 more minutes we would have been able to get the pizza. too bad she missed out on a fat tip. when we called a manager he informed us that we should have been waiting for them in our hotel both the delivery lady and the manger handled the situation unprofessionally. i am now sitting in my hotel room eating club crackers and clementines for my dinner due to their inability to arrive on time. hanging up on a customer is unprofessional, and they should be evaluated on their inability to do their job. avoid."}
{"text":"Constantly out of items. Second time out of two orders I got a call saying they were out of something. FIrst time was hersey's dunkers, second time was the garlic knot pizza."}
{"text":"I'm disappointed that I have to give them 1 star. I ordered a large 2 topping pizza and a 14 piece boneless wings. Ugh!  Everything was cold and dry and the delivery took forever as well. I will never again order from here."}
{"text":"I tried to order 3-pizzas and some boneless wings online.  I'd taken an online survey to receive a $10-off coupon.  Unfortunately, because I'd ordered a special (2 medium pizzas for $6.99 each) the discount wouldn't apply.  I'd also ordered a custom pizza and wings.

Anyway, I called the store and the manager said she'd honor the coupon.  I gave her my order and phone number and waited . . . and waited.  An hour and a half later I called - they said that the person knocked (didn't, we were inside) and called the number, which was wrong.  They said they'd create another order and be back within 39 minutes.  ANOTHER hour later I called - they said that the pizzas were just coming out of the oven.

To make a long story short - they comped my entire order, but by the time everything finally arrived people had started cooking other foods (we usually do this anyway).  My gripe isn't actually with the staff of this restaurant, other than they didn't really hurry once they realized the mistake of the wrong phone number (their store is no more than 5 minutes' drive from our place).

My gripe is actually with the chain itself.  If they're going to make me jump through hoops to get a coupon then let me use it on an order that meets their criteria for application EVEN THOUGH I had ordered some specials (the rest of the order met the minimum criteria)."}
{"text":"I have been a Pizza Hut customer for over 20 years. I received the worst service from this Pizza Hut. First of all, I called my order in..very basic order, just cheese sticks and a personal pan. I was told it would be 20 minutes. I get there exactly at 20 minutes. I was told that they were behind a little and that my order was just now being put in the oven. That was cool..I understand things can get behind. So I go and run some errands. I get back almost 20 minutes later to find out (after waiting a few more minutes) that my food still had not been prepared. I requested a refund. The manager came up and gave my money back and said he would just give me my food for free. After waiting a while, my personal pan came but no cheese sticks. I asked the cashier about my cheese sticks. She went back to the manager who told her to tell me (1) he never promised me cheesesticks (lie #1) and when I countered that lie she said (2) that they ran out of cheesesticks (lie #2). I will never go back there. Very incompetent, ghetto staff there. But lucky for me, I found who owned this Pizza Hut location. A company called America's Pizza Company, phone number is (337) 289-0404. Ask to speak to Nicole! I don't play when it come to customer service. I called Nicole who apologized (although she seemed uninterested in knowing which store it was) and claimed she was going to send me coupons for free pizza (I have yet to receive them). Also there were other people who were waiting a long amount of time for their pizza and was equally frustrated with the staff there."}
{"text":"Website was super easy to order. Delivery guy on time and friendly! Pizza Hut 4 Life!"}
{"text":"Do not order anything from this location...the store employees and managers are rude and simply don't care about customer satisfaction.  There are plenty of other options nearby that offer much better customer service."}
{"text":"Well..assuming you actually get what's ordered it's not too bad. Not the first time they've screwed up in the order, but it is my first time not having a delivery at all. Im pretty sure it's on purpose, as it was a 50% off coupon the restaurant probably refused to acknowledge it in order to keep their sales margins high. Pretty BS as it's a chain restaurant. Naturally I called several times but couldn't get through until the next day, at which point they said it was delivered. That must be a neat trick because I sure as hell didn't get anything. The chain is fine I suppose, but avoid this restaurant if you want delivery food. At the very least choose to pay with cash so you're not out any money. Not bothering with them again"}
{"text":"I will not go back to this place after the two visits I had this past weekend. My son loves pizza hut for some reason, so I gave in and ordered from here. I placed my order on-line - the box meal they advertise, some wings and dipping sauces (a little annoyed that not even one dipping sauce comes with the wings) and received the specified time that my order would be ready. I arrived about 5 minutes after my order was scheduled to be ready. When I got there, my pizza was ready, but for some reason they neglected to include the wings and sauces I paid for. so I had to wait about 10 minutes for them to make my wings. Once they were finished I was sent on my way with no apology or anything.

On Sunday my son wanted their wings again, so I gave them another shot. Once again I placed my order on-line and got there about 5 minutes after my order was scheduled to be ready. After I paid, I was told that my order wasn't quite ready. After about 10-15 minutes a girl came out and gave me my wings. Again, no apology for the wait or anything. I asked her if I could speak to a manager because by this time I was beyond frustrated. She told me I'd have to wait because she was busy. I explained that I had been waiting for almost 15 minutes for my food. I didn't feel like I should have to continue waiting, especially since all it would take was for her turn around, look through the window and ask the manager to come up. Rather than get the manager, she argued with me about why I needed to wait. After I kind of yelled through the window myself, a manager came out. When I explained what had happened on this visit and the visit two days prior, she shrugged her shoulders, said she was sorry and that they were busy. I looked at her in disbelief because there was only one family in the establishment and there were three other people working in the kitchen. I complained a little more, but could see that she really didn't care. I told her I would not be a returning customer and again her response was a shoulder shrug. I will say that another customer did come in and placed an order while I was waiting for my food, but if they can't handle multiple orders at one time then they really should reconsider being open for business at all.

One other thing of note is that on the second visit the place looked and smelled dirty. The floors weren't clean and there was just a foul odor that overpowered the smell of the food.

They get 1 star because yelp won't let me submit with 0."}
{"text":"We had our issues with delivery from this location before and I've sworn up and down to NEVER order Pizza Hut again but here we are ... today we order 2 large pizza and 1 order of garlic bread and pizzas were pretty basic believe it or not ! The email confirm received showed delivery to be expected by 650pm yes I know this is an estimate and after numerous calls to the store and being reassured the driver was on his way pizza finally arrived at 750pm 1 whole hour after the estimated time !! Needless to say we sent the driver away with our cold order and took the alternate to feed the STARVING children. HORRIBLE SERVICE I promise this time will definitely be the last time I swear !!!"}

{"text":"Nothing like sitting at the drive through pickup window looking at your pizzas sitting on the counter for 5 minutes before anyone realizes they have customers waiting. ...and yes there were three people working, no they were not busy, and yes it took forever for anyone to come to the window from the time we pulled up.  They true question is what was the worker girl doing with the boss in the kitchen...and why did she come out with such a big smile...and she only came out because I called and told them to walk out, pick up our pizzas on the counter,  and bring them to the window.   

Unreal."}
{"text":"Staff extremely rude.  Attempting to get some help with an online order and between being put on hold and the rudeness of the staff and the manager on duty (I tried to place my order at approximately 6pm and the manager's name started with an M) - lost me as a customer for life.  Way better options around - no need to come here and be treated rudely."}
{"text":"Well now reading all the reviews I would've never placed an order with them to begin with. I work at an office and 3 of us decided to order a pizza and wings. It was going to arrive 7 mins prior to our lunch break (12:53). We placed the order at 12:15. For an hour our pizza said it was still in the\"oven\" on the website for tracking our pizza. I finally called and express how upset we were due to having 30 min lunch break and our food should've been here well over 20 mins ago. The manager Malik said he only had one driver and he didn't know where he was, and that they had a ton of orders....not being a bitch but that's not my fault. He then told us we could pick the pizza up. He told us he could give us a Pizza Hut credit, but the pizza would still be a while..... WHAT?! Finally after bickering back and forth we decided to cancel our pizza now that it's been over an hour and we're all starving and have to go back to work. NEVER. AGAIN. I wouldn't even give them a star.

Manager Malik didn't want to give us his last name, and wouldn't give us the corporate number either. He said we can find it online."}
{"text":"If only they could take correct order the Last two times I've ordered I get the wrong wings or missing ingredients !! One of the orders over the phone,  maybe they can't hear.. and the Last one online, they can't read!!! Pizza and wings are good when you get what you order...!!!"}
{"text":"Would give no stars if possible! We've ordered from the Pizza Hut in Avondale once, and I was excited that it was close, but we found a really long hair baked in the pizza. We called , they took the complaint, and gave credit on their record for a new pizza. We came in today, and all of a sudden they have no record of it plus the female manager had no customer service training at all. My mom explained to her that  she talked to a female. The manager started giving her an attitude saying that there are no other female managers, and unless we spoke to a manager nobody else could make that call. I told her that we simply called in, and was told a pizza would be comped by the person on the other line. We didn't verify that she was a manager. We left empty handed. Last time we're coming here,  and already posted it on FB to notify my 700+ friends."}
{"text":"Okay for carryout, but reconsider if you're going to dine in. They are extremely slow. We've been here a few times and they are always slow. The last time we went because the kids really wanted pizza and we waited for quite a long time to place our order and then they burnt the breadsticks. Wasn't aware that was even possible at Pizza Hut!"}
{"text":"You know, we tried their 2 medium pizza deal. Not sure if I would do it again... or even get pizza there again. The quality has dropped. It's not like it use to be. Really nice people though!"}
{"text":"Oh Pizza Hut. Why do I keep giving you chances? Paper thin, greasy pizza with no flavor. Already had to return one pizza tonight because it was inedible. Second one pretty much the same but we were too hungry to wait another hour. Definitely done with this location."}
{"text":"As a treat and deciding to be a lazy mom night I gave in and ordered a \"pizza hut pizza\" for the kids. I ordered two medium pizzas online with a coupon, no problems. Very easy to order. They called 10minutes before the \"estimated delivery time\" to confirm the address and said the pizzas will be there in the next 20 minutes. So after waiting half an hour at least I knew dinner would be here in the next 20 minutes. So 20 minutes came and went. An hour later our Luke warm pizzas arrived one of them were even right. The other had a different crust. They were the greasiest half assed pizzas I've ever seen. 
If I could give this place zero stars I would."}
{"text":"My wife and I frequent the location for dinner at least once a month. There isn't many places in the area for dine in pizza which cater to our needs as parents as well as customers. In the past this location was a very nice place to take children to. At one time this location  had a little corner designed for children to play in. During this trip we noticed that the area that once entertained children now entertained nothing but a large table and chairs. Based on this fact, the service and the appearance of the interior it is evident that management has no clue how to run a business or they have given up. What the H happened to this place? This isn't the place we once knew. Our table had remnants of ceiling plaster on it when we sat down. Definitely going to Court House Pizza next time! One star cuz the app made me."}
{"text":"As it says on the web friendly !???? But it's the opposite . This location when it comes to customer service sucks . Treat your customers well because it's your bread and butter . If you don't know how to take care of your customers and treat them well you're in the wrong place to work . It was an unpleasant experience that I had at this location today . Whoever is your restaurant manager go to basics and retrain your employees especially in taking care of your customers . I never encounter such very rude employees .. I worked for Pizza Hut in Hawaii for so long and we never tolerated this behavior !"}
{"text":"Be careful when you order delivery from this Pizza Hut.  It seems as if the delivery drivers/cashiers/managers, etc. like to bump up your total after you've signed your charge slip.  They stole from me - you could be next."}
{"text":"Terrible experience. Last two times they have messed order up and been late . Today that forgot parts of my order didn't get it right and were late . Tried to call them twice to tell them ... They hung up on me . Must recognize my number and they knew they messed up. What a waste of money ."}
{"text":"This place is horrible. Ordered twice from this location, and both times they had to call and say they were out of this or that. This time, my whole order was canceled, when I'd anticipated they were just canceling what they were out of. Manager quickly hung up before I could confirm. Called back not even a minute later, and was told they didn't even have my order. Don't know why I've even bothered with them at all, but I most definitely will not be trying a 3rd time."}
{"text":"Terrible service. Placed my order online for two large pizzas for delivery. When the pizza arrived, I opened the box and instead of receiving large & I got 2 medium pizzas. Are you kidding me. Paid $32 for 2 medium pizzas when I ordered large! Smh!!!"}
{"text":"It's Pizza Hut. So I give it a 4 for consistency and options (we like the crust option)s. We eat pizza once a week and Pizza hut is one place that everyone will eat."}

Went to some other Desi
Pizza store better than tht !"}
{"text":"Amazing! Idk why people give them bad reviews, talking about being unprofessional. If the drive is close do it. And if you see your food in the window say something. It's your own fault. I have had only great experiences here. If you see a bad review it's because they are obviously drama queens!"}
{"text":"This pizza Hut is pretty great, as long as you get the right waitress.  I was there and waited for two hours before getting upset and leaving. I was brought two items, both of which were not what I wanted, before my waitress realized what I wanted.  Others waited 30 minutes before getting served."}
{"text":"I will never be ordering from Pizza Hut again.  The poor customer service is UNREAL.  I ordered a pizza via phone and paid with my card. Everything was confirmed and I was told it could take up to an hr and a half (which is crazy, but I agreed to it). As I was waiting, I received a phone call from an unknown number. I screen my calls so I didn't pick up- no voicemail was left. I called Pizza Hut TWO hours after I placed my order  kindly asking where my pizza was and I was told that my order was canceled a while ago because they called me and I didn't answer. They called because I'm a new customer in their system (keep in mind all of my info was already confirmed).  I was never told I'd be receiving a call and no one left a message. After talking to the store employee, I asked if they could put in my order now and have it delivered and I was told NO. Yep- you read that right- I was NOT ALLOWED to buy a pizza. I was told that once an order is canceled for my address that they cannot deliver to that address the same day EVEN if a brand new order is placed. I cannot believe that a business can run in this way. I was trying to BUY a pizza and was denied business. My husband then tried to call to place an order- first, the line disconnected, then he was told they weren't taking new delivery orders, then we were told it would be another hour and a half if we wanted a pizza. Absolutely ridiculous. Pizza Hut, I salute you (in total sarcasm). Somehow with the outrageously TERRIBLE customer service you remain a business. I will be sharing this story with my family and friends and reviewing you on very social media outlet I have access too. You suck, Pizza Hut."}
{"text":"I didn't feel like going out because I was sick with a cold, so I ordered online. I ordered garlic knots, pasta, and soda. Not only did the delivery driver call me and tell me that he was on his way, but he was early. The food was hot, and very good! The driver had a wonderful personality and was friendly. Thank you, Pizza Hut, for making my night a little better."}
{"text":"Ordered from this place twice ! First time the delivery guy was 30 min late , the pizza was cold and overcooked and the second time he never showed up!! Horrible service !"}
{"text":"There was a person who took my order,  they said it would take 45 minutes and then I call about after an hour and they never placed my order. Second time I called the manager answered he said it would be another 30 minutes which going past midnight. Not pleased with this pizza hut."}
{"text":"Pizza Hut has new flavored drizzles and crust that taste so good it cannot be easily described. I rank their pizza among the 5 best pizzas I have ever had. I highly recommend you grab their pizza to eat when your looking for a convenient and satisfying meal!!!"}
{"text":"I wish I could give less than 1 star. I've never written a negative review for anything in my life-but was SO disappointed by this service I felt I needed to. Placed my order and was told it would take 40 minutes, I am a pretty patient person, so I figured when it had taken 50 minutes to not bother calling--it's a Saturday night, they are busy, I get it. Then the time hit an hour, with no update to me about where my order was. I call (took about 5 minutes to even get someone to answer) and was told the driver should be delivering any moment. 15 minutes pass, still nothing. I call again and I am asked \"oh you still want your pizza?\" I say yes, and they say that it will be another 20 minutes with NO explanation NO apology. I completely understand that businesses get busy but the way this was handled as if I was the inconvenience was completely NOT okay. I am a paying customer. NEVER ordering from this location again, and have already warned all my friends in the area to do the same."}
{"text":"I just had the absolute worst customer service experience of my life... The girl manager is the rudest girl ever.. I ordered a medium pizza and 8 wings an hour ago, I just checked online I have another 2 hours to wait.. I'm 5 minutes up street and currently injured so I cannot drive... I call and talk to employee, he was very nice and transferred me to manager... Then it all went down hill... I asked what's going on, because the guy told me if I placed an order right now it would take 75 minutes... So when I talked to manager I said I ordered an hour ago, it says I have another 2 hours... I'm not understanding why I'm waiting so long.. She told me they didn't have a lot of drivers earlier, but now they do so the order times are shorter... I said shouldn't I be in line? Why does it matter you have more drivers now and not before.. She says \"that's how our system works, I don't know you can figure a ride her and get your food if you want... So I say, well can you cancel my order and redo it so I can have my food 50 minutes earlier... She says I can't do that, I have to reorder online and go through it again. Absolutely the most uneducated manager I have ever talked to in my life.I downloaded Yelp for the first time ever just to let people know these reviews are no joke, that was beyond the worst experience with ordering I have ever had.while writing this review, I had my girlfriend order food. Dominos is already making it and deliver time is less than 30 minutes.. This is just sad to be treated this way, I'm a very nice person.. I just can't believe what just happened from a Pizza Hut business.."}
{"text":"I at tached pictures in case you don't believe this. Just because you run a special doesn't  mean you have to rip people off. I got a large two topping pizza. I noticed this \"large pie\" would not feed me much less me and my two kids! And moms not even here to eat. By the way this took 20 minutes to be ready. So I stopped on way home fir a hot and ready so kiddos could get full......exact same size!!! And it was ready instantly. I have always like pizza huts flavor but when you treat your customers like we are dumb we are done. Me and my kids are still laughing at this poorly made tiny little pizza. Bty why put a pizza in avocado that has lots of room to make it look bigger.... Seriously?! Box exact same size pizza was smaller. What a joke we will not eat Pizza Hut again sadly. Please look for pictures I attached unless they take them down."}
{"text":"We order here a lot (because this Pizza Hut is better than the one that is closer to us) and have never had a complaint.  Tonight, I ordered two pizzas and breadsticks online, and my husband (who was not sure what I ordered) was given only one - that did not match our order.  Before he had even gotten home, they had caught the error, called, and sent out a deliver person with the breadsticks and two correct pizzas (even though we were outside their delivery area), telling us to keep the one he had brought home as well.  So, I have to say they really went the extra mile to make the order right, and the pizzas were really inexpensive to begin with, so they certainly lost money to make the order good. It isn't often that a restaurant will go so far to give good service, anymore.  Much appreciated!  We will definately stick with them!"}
{"text":"I love Pizza Hut but this location sucks! They Took forever to acknowledge and help us. Plus the brownies were tasteless & the pizza was dry and there was no sauce."}
{"text":"Got a large pizza for delivery and it took almost two hours. On a Monday night. Pizza was cold. Had to call back twice to see where our pizza was. The person taking the order wouldn't even let me finish the card number and I had to repeat myself several times. Awful service. Deserves zero stars."}
{"text":"Rudest service I've ever dealt with from a pizza company in my life. If you want to get yelled at by your delivery person and have to wonder if your food is going to get spit into then eat here."}
{"text":"More than a year after moving into my house and they still can't find my address.  Used the sales office address to order.  Got text saying pizza was out for delivery. 40 minutes later and still no pizza.  I can honestly walk there Faster.  It less 3 miles away."}
{"text":"The service was soooo slow, impolite staff, and the food was uncooked. I really don't recommend it."}
{"text":"If I could give this location 0 stars I would. From constistantly screwing up orders to delivering to the wrong house, this location is representative of the worst service I have ever received. When I recently called to correct an order where the driver did not actually show up at my house, the manager insisted that it was my mistake for not answering the door and wouldn't do a thing to correct it. Simply appalling service."}
{"text":"Hot food if you ever get it.  Forgetful cooks and waitstaff.  Save yourself the trouble and head up the road to Brooklyn South Pizzeria @ 19400 Jetton Rd # 201, Cornelius, NC (I'm not associated with them just offering up a better local alternative)"}
{"text":"I ordered the $5 dollar special from this Pizza Hut. (Buy one regular priced medium or large pizza and get the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th medium pizza for $5 each.) The cashier was friendly and we didn't have to wait long for our pizzas. When we got home and took a bite, we immediately knew something was very off. The bottom of the pizza was dense and doughy. We tried to bake the pizzas in our little conventional oven but even after all the cheese had sizzled, the bottom still tasted the same. I'm not sure if the pizza was just under-baked or if the dough had not risen properly. It was quite disappointing. I'll probably give this pizza hut another try if there's another promotion as the location is very convenient for me but this visit was a definite miss."}
{"text":"Usually good customer service, although last time I ordered pizza it was the worst experience I ever had! About two wings had sauce the rest were dry with no flavor! I asked for no seasoning on bread sticks and sure enough it was delivered with seasoning. I tried calling the store back and was on hold for 30 minutes till I was hung up on."}
{"text":"HORRIBLE SERVICE!! I called to order a pizza and the guy on the phone told me it would take 20 mint to pick up. When I got  THERE,    there was this really young kid/teenager on the register. I paid for my pizza and waited and waited. Mean while you can hear a young girl cursing in the back and laughing away. After 45 minutes later I asked him what was going up with the pizza,  he said he would check,  he went to the back and I clearly heard him tell a coworker \"this bi#$% wants her pizza '. When he returned I confronted him asking him if he had just called me that and he turned red and said no and walked away. The manager showed up and he made excuses for him saying he was tired and tried to give me a coupon. I told him I didn't care about the money it was the respect. Then he said he always has trouble with this guy. Manager could not make up his mind. THIS KID NEEDS TO GET  HIS A@%@ WIPPED AND BE TAUGHT A MANNER LESSON. HE HAS NO RESPECT!! AND THE PIZZA WAS  HORRIBLE. NEVER GOING BACK AGAIN. WORSE PLACE EVER, WORSE CUSTOMER SERVICE."}
{"text":"So let me start off by saying I order delivery at this location quit often. Today when placed an order for delivery, there was a problem. 1st the delivery driver was scared to get out of his vehicle, so I had to physically go outside and wave him up. He come up to my door and tells me that my total is $20 even, which I also felt was strange because the email I received said that my total was $14.69 (order number 3150426182820001181026612), but I didn't think much off it me decided that I will give him the $20 and pass it off as a tip. I go to sit down to enjoy my dinner and I open it to what you see below, except in this picture you have you manager Sonia attempting to put together a pizza that is missing a slice and had been tampered with, not to mention you see no jalapeños, which I was supposedly charged for after my email confirmation of $14.69 came through bringing my total up to $19.05. As you can see in the picture, there are no cinistix and the pizza is not a whole pizza. When calling down to complain about what I just went through, the girl who answered said to me, well your not getting anything until you bring me down the pizza. Im sorry I did not keep the pizza I sent it back with your delivery driver. I can not believe your store had the AUDACITY to deliver me a pizza in this condition. I cannot believe your delivery driver told me $20 when that was not my total. And to make it right your manager turned our pizza into a got damn puzzle trying to put it back together and than said \"I'll give you a discount on the one I'm making now\". How dare you guys try such a low move. I'm not one to typically write into a business when I have bad service, but this was just the worst I have EVER seen. I am in shock as to how you guys would try to pass this off as okay. When your manager seen I was taking pictures she closed the box so I was unable to take the pictures I wanted to, I can understand she was very much flustered and was unsure of how to react but this is just completely unacceptable.

{"text":"This afternoon I ordered delivery, which is typical for me when ordering from pizza hut. I've never ran into any issues until today. My delivery arrives, I tip the driver and he goes on his way. I order 1 pizza and 2 orders of wings totaling $50. When I open my wings I notice they are incorrect I look at my receipt to ensure I ordered them correctly and proceed to call the store to see if we can get this cleared up. Trevor, the store manager, answers the phone and after I tell him the issue he decides he's heard enough and decides to get an attitude. 1st off as a manager you should know that talking to an adult like a child is not the way to resolve things. 2nd off how do you get an attitude with a customer for a mistake YOU made? I didn't want credit, I didn't want free food I just wanted the wings I ordered and I was willing to pick them up. But the manager didn't give me the opportunity to tell him that. I asked for his managers information which he would not provide me stating that he would not give me the information because I was not being civil and then hangs up on me. By now I'm fuming, such a small, easy to fix mistake is now something I have to comment on. Nonetheless I  went down to the store, demanded a refund, his name and his district managers information. They say they do not have a corporate number because they are a franchise so probably gave me some BS name, phone number, and email. I cannot believe the lack of customer service at this location, I order pizza hut 2-3 times a month and order for a family of 5 so you can imagine the total cost I spend each time. I will gladly take my business elsewhere."}
{"text":"Saturday night I had the worst experience that I have ever had in a restaurant.  We were out of town and the pet sitter ordered a pizza to be delivered to my house.  The delivery vehicle broke down in my driveway and the driver just left the car there.  While I was in between flights coming home late that evening, I contacted Pizza Hut to ask them to have the car removed from my driveway.  They told me that it wasn't their responsibility it was the driver's responsibility and that they had fired the driver that evening.  I told them that the driver was their representative and had their logo on his car and that this was their problem.  I then asked them for the name and number of the driver so that I could contact him to address the situation but they said that they could not do that.

Talk about an organization that does not stand behind its employees.  I will never ever go to a Pizza Hut restaurant anywhere in the country."}
{"text":"I usually find their food greasy but not here.

Great service, flexible with toppings, delivery price is cheap.

Walk in pizzas done fast!"}
{"text":"zero stars. just simply don't do it. order from marco's pizza instead 702-291-3511. a bunch of tweakers run this place. terrible."}
{"text":"This Pizza Hut is AWFUL. I wish I could give zero stars. We haven't ordered in over two years because the last experience was horrible. So we order $50 worth of food. The pizzas were wrong, the food was cold and the delivery was slow. Called the store and they did end up giving us a $40 credit. So I go there a week later with a friend. The hostess/waitress was one of the rudest I have ever come in contact with. She acted like we were putting her out. She interrupted me while I was speaking and treated us like crap. I will NEVER go back. They can keep their $40"}
{"text":"This place is a shithole! Good luck getting anything on time unless you order inside. Ordering online is a joke, I got three emails pizza was ready I walked four blocks down to have a cashier totally clueless with no pizza. Save yourself from the stress go to pizza sola!"}
{"text":"I love the pizza but if you order wings they don't come with ranch. Really, you are going to charge for a single ranch or blue cheese with the order?  I can see if you want extra dipping sauce but for just a single it's $.050 each ????"}
{"text":"Ordered on line @ 6:20pm (pizza, wings and cinnamon sticks desert), delivery time was for 7:20pm. 7:38pm  no delivery. Called this store, sent directly to recording on hold. About 28 min later someone picks up. Girl rude, insisted I had no order cause she couldn't find it under my name. Offered to give her on-line confirmation #, she says no, no, no, what's your #. She finds order under my # tells me to hold on she's going to find out what's going on w/my order. She comes back on & says my order has been delivered. I explain that I didn't get my order & that I ordered w/a credit card, did someone sign for it. She says yes. long story short, they delivered it to apt above, didn't even ask for ID/credit card. Just let person sign and left. Manager said she apologizes & will credit my account and re-deliver order. It's now 10:03pm & still no pizza. On hold w/store at this moment going on 22 minutes. Manager says she can't do anything & that I would have to speak to General Manager. My son has fallen asleep,  and I'm not happy.

**REALLY??? 1ST CALL  TOTAL OF 39 MINUTES AND 4 SECONDS

THIS CALLED (I'M STILL ON HOLD), GOING ON 32 MINUTES & 40 SECONDS!!!

LOCATION CLOSES @ 11PM!!!

Got 1 star because I had to pick a star rating. Deserves \"0\" star!!!

Update:
It's now 11pm when business hour closes.  Continued to stay on hold up until closing which I've stayed on hold for 1 hour 17 minutes & 34 seconds. Never answered! Never got my pizza order re-delivered! & my son never got to eat his pizza either!!! 

Oh and earlier when on phone w/manager and she said they'll re-deliver my order I asked how long is it going to be, she replied whenever they have a driver available. Guess there wasn't any available,  huh. RIDICULOUS!!!"}
{"text":"I am completely and utterly disgusted with this location. I have never felt so unappreciated as a customer and I will never come to this location as long as they keep those type of employees there. I started to place an order and this girl wasn't even paying attention. I had to correct her 3 times just to get my order right. She kept rolling her eyes, making loud sighs as if she doesn't even want to work there, and her attitude is completely unacceptable. Once my order was FINALLY taken and my food was being prepared, I overheard her talking to another employee stating she would spit in some people's food if she knows who is making the order and all the parties she goes to and very inappropriate subjects (sexually) while laughing so loud about it. As she brought up my food I checked her name tag and she snarls \"What are you looking at?\" I am telling you Nichole is not worth my business there. Especially when she smells she is under the influence of marijuana and bloodshot eyes. NO MORE business from me!!! I'd rather catch the bus to the Pizza Hut on 43rd and Glendale than walk across the street to this poor of an excuse business. IF YOU DON'T WANT YOUR PIZZA (OR WHATEVER ORDER) SPIT ON, HANDLED, OR EVEN IN THE PRESENCE OF AN EMPLOYEE WHO IS HIGH ON THE JOB AND WANTS TO RUN THEIR MOUTH, I HIGHLY RECOMMEND TO NOT GO TO THIS LOCATION!!!"}
{"text":"Not good overall. I got the \"get as many toppings as you want\" for a flat price (as stated on the mobile app) thinking at least a moderate amount of toppings would be used. Price was good considering what I got on the pizza, however when I saw it, I was surprised at so few toppings! I got chicken, bacon, spinach, and mushrooms on it, but we could barely enjoy the toppings as we all dug in (because there were so few!) Im not being picky, this thing had very little on it! Plus, the spinach was sprinkled raw over the top of the pizza. Strange. Almost as if someone forgot it was supposed to have spinach and just threw it on after it went through the oven instead of making another. Maybe that's just how they put spinach on their pizza, but that's the first time I've ever seen that. Two stars because the pizza did taste okay, but was barely warm. Considering this is only a carry out/delivery venue, I expected more. I'll stick with the other pizza options in Waxhaw. (There's plenty!)"}
{"text":"What is up with this place ? The owner needs to get it together. Employees super slow and can't figure anything out. Online order took 30+ min over from stated pickup time. Why?"}
{"text":"I love Pizza Hut pizza!! Their naturally  thick crust is delicious...I've never tried their breadsticks but I'm dying to, they look delicious as well!"}
{"text":"This is the 2nd time I ordered from them and they screwed up my order big time every time!  I am done with them they have terrible service! I will never order from them again!"}
{"text":"This has to be one of the worst experiences of my life.  Following reasons are below. 

1.  Took over 90 minutes for my food so the soda was warm and the pizza/wings were cold.  
2.  The driver couldn't get into my gate with my code.  Then I spoke to the manager and advised I would be coming down stairs and the driver wasn't even there.
3.  I specifically said no onions and there we onions.  

I will never ever order from there again.  If I could give them a half star I would."}
{"text":"The food is always hot and fresh.  I always order online and the food arrives pretty quickly.  The Garlic Parmesan Wings are addicting!  My family fights over them like mud on a shoe horse!!!"}
{"text":"It's just a damn carry out or delivery pizza hut, what's not to like?  I prefer this to olive oils next door.  With the new toppings, drizzles, and crusts, it's delicious."}
{"text":"Fast delivery, pizza is always hot. Been ordering for over a year and only once has it taken more than 30 minutes to deliver."}
{"text":"This is probably worst Pizza Hut location you can order from! terrible customer service, the workers were very rude and had no desire to help. Lazy lazy lazy lazy! If you want your pizza on time and fresh, don't order from here. Thanks for the great service ;)!"}
{"text":"We order delivery from here sometimes and always receive our food on-time or even earlier. The pizza is always great and the customer service is excellent. They deserve all your business, they've never failed me. Give them a try now!"}
{"text":"We ordered Pizza Hut last night, it was here quickly and that's about all that was good about it. We ordered 14 chicken bites (got 12), a large meat lovers with stuffed crust, which was maybe about 2mm thick and sadly, I'm NOT kidding! I took pics to prove it but can't seem to add them. We also ordered a second large Hawaiian pizza, for the deal which included two dips and 2Litre. The second pizza literally had a splash of tomato sauce on a thicker, more regular type crust. Multiple slices of it literally had 1-2 pieces of ham ONLY, but more pineapple and cheese, to cover up the missing ham?  All this for $43. Total RIPOFF! Will not be purchasing Pizza Hut ever again. What happened to you guys?! You USED to be the best around when I was a kid. Disappointed:("}
{"text":"Good food by the delivery takes FOREVER!! Lol. And the wings were a little over cooked last time o was there."}
{"text":"The food was good, but the service wasn't. We went in at 9pm on a Friday, and everything took too long. When we asked for separate bills, the waitress said that she couldn't do that. We couldn't even pay for our individual items. We all ordered different meals, but we were forced to split the cost evenly. I wish we were able to tip the cook instead."}
{"text":"Always hot, always tasty, I love my large stuffed crust pepperoni and pineapple with jalapeños pizza and a side of spicy BBQ wings. Only complaint is they don't put enough pineapple on it. Also, I hate their app"}
{"text":"Really like going to this Pizza Hut now the teenager by the name Enrique is really nice its was a really busy Saturday night he apologized for the long wait which I didn't care as long as the pizza was hot and good :)"}
{"text":"Well it's the best Pizza Hut place i ever go to. But the problem was my medium meat lover pizza cost $20 in total."}
{"text":"recently moved from another pizza hut neighborhood and this sucks big time when compared to older pizza hut.
1. they don't have order display TV
2. had my pizza ready more than 5 minutes late
3. quarter (not even half) done crust flavor"}
{"text":"Always on time and the food is warm and delicious.  Drivers are always nice and professional."}
{"text":"Horrible customer service by Lisa. Made a wrong order and then argued over the phone. She definitely needs training in talking  to customers and making pizza as well."}
{"text":"This Pizza Hut location has poor customer service!  This last time I called in to place an order the guy seemed overly put out to even answer the phone let alone take my order.  Sorry Pizza Hut, but I told him to forget it since it was such a bother and hung up.  Barro's down the street got our business.  It's all about customer service and some people at this location need a little more training."}
{"text":"I live right across the street yet it takes them an hour to deliver a pizza that takes 10 minutes to cook. Not okay with this! I'd rather cook a frozen pizza!"}
{"text":"This Pizza Hut is a winner!  The staff is friendly and they have never messed up my order, even when I order online.  Since I live so close I have never had them deliver but I assume they do that pretty well."}
{"text":"Bad customer service. Walked in and nobody was up front so I waited five minutes and yelled hello and nobody answered. Why? Because they were too busy chattering about non-work related gossip. Had to call the store from the lobby to get somebody to come out to answer the phone and tell them that it was me calling because hey we're too busy chatting. They'll probably steal my credit card info now for writing a bad complaint about them"}
{"text":"So I ordered some wings deal called the mountain dew deal came with a drink some wings that I ordered for my nephew and I got me some wings and fries, when it came, they combined the fries order together in a bigger bowl which I was just like ok whatever but then he said where is my soda, I called the pizza hut back and told them about this the manager apparently answered the phone and said \" Well I just talked to my driver and he said he gave you everything\" I cut his ass off and just said that's ok I'll just leave a review. I gave that driver a five dollar tip on top of my $37.00 order. I'll find a new spot. My 7 year old nephew says Thanks"}
{"text":"This Pizza Hut is horrible! The workers are rude. I called and held for more than 15 minutes! I should have hung up the phone, but I was so upset I held because I couldn't believe I was on hold that long. This establishment should be closed!!! It's ridiculous!"}
{"text":"We ordered a pizza with spinach. It came to us with a cooked pizza with raw spinach on top! It was literally just thrown on there raw. So ridiculous. After we took off the uncooked spinach the pizza was actually not bad. It wasn't cut either. We had to cut it again."}
{"text":"This place is consistently terrible. I bought a medium pizza and breadstick yesterday and was disappointed once again. The breadsticks were squished in to a box and cut in to oblong pieces. Furthermore, the pizza and breadsticks were dry. This pizza hut location has been consistently terrible."}
{"text":"I get take-out from here occasionally, purely out of convenience and lack of competition.  During my last pick-up, the evening of 6-22-12, I witnessed a patron quietly complaining about the confusion and lack of separation between those waiting to pay, waiting for an order, and waiting to be seated.  The front waiting area was in mass confusion.  The response from the manager on duty was to insult the patron, saying \"grown men should be able to wait on pizza, and basically, I don't care\".  This is not an acceptable response for management.  
The quality of our pizza is mediocre at best, with the toppings being more than 2 inches from the edge on a hand tossed pizza.  The lady at the register was friendly as usual.
This Pizza Hut is not a top choice, but ok in a pinch."}
{"text":"Absolutely horrible service. Ordered online and called 15 minutes after Pizza was supposed to be delivered. Someone mumbled and asked for my phone number and pretending to understand it, saying someone would be there any minute. Another 15 minutes later, he does not even pretend and I had to cancel my order. What a reliable service! It was obvious that they were lying the whole time and probably did not have anyone wanting to run a route. I am still marking delivery as a yes since they at least promised it."}
{"text":"Ordered a pizza online to be delivered to a friend who just had a baby. He put $0 as a tip because it wasn't him paying for it and they put a 1 in front of the 0 giving themselves a $10 tip. I called and told them about it and have yet to hear back."}
{"text":"Pizza Hut is usually my favorite place to order pizza from, and it always has been. The last order i made was off, cold and not so good. They gave me a credit, and ere very nice about it. Made things right. It was a $80 order. 
I decided to use that edit now a couple weeks later to order again. I got a half and half large stuffed crust pizza. The pizza came with incorrect toppings, and a ton of pepperoni on the top of one side, missing another topping. I called and told them this is the second time it had been wrong, and they said they'd give me another credit. This was a $40 order.
The girl Logan was so incredibly rude, i asked to speak to her manager. She said she is the manager. I told her she was so rude. She said that she apologized, and that she wasn't rude. I told her it was her tone of voice that was rude and disrespectful. She said well I'm giving you a credit? I told her i understood that but she's still a bitch. 
Granted, i shouldn't have called her a bitch. But i have ALWAYS loved Pizza Hut. And I feel like they're going to shit. How could they hire a manager that is so rude to customers over the phone, and so poor at fixing a problem. I definitely will think twice before ordering from them again. 
Pizza hut has been by favorite my entire life, and their food and employees are going to shit. 

Thanks for the friendly help LOGAN! :)"}
{"text":"Everything from the 1st contact, which would have been Stacey on the phone  taking or delivery order. She explaind the specials, suggested what she thought would best accomodate our needs but the best ...... Assure us we were in great hands and we would be completly satisfied! Guess what , she was right ! Delivery, very fast and extremely efficient, friendly and helpful. And the Pizza it self was exactly how we ordered it ! Xtra cheese, extra Sauce, sounds boring but the best way to test a restraunt of its ability to listen to there guest.. Perfect! Hot, hot, hot! And Perfectly cooked! Thanks Pizza Hut. I'm back. And I will be back. E."}
{"text":"Literally worst experience ever.. Billy Jean, worst employee I've ever met.. After messing up my order she chose to be aggresive and deffensive, repeatedly(on the phone and in person).. I brought the incorrect pizza back to the store, explained that there was no need for rudeness(oh the rudeness) I said I'm sorry and I  understand your system wasn't working, suggested she escalate it to management, to which she replied \"well its all fixed so you have no reason to complain\"..unreasonably rude with no apology or acknowledgement of messing up my order..she's either a child that has no place in the work place, or not someone that should be in a position that interacts with people"}
{"text":"Busy evening, placed delivery order, arrived on time but opened the box to find soggy uncooked pizza. Tried for 15 minutes to call the store and kept getting Dallas where the calls are forwarded to. Dallas stated that when the stores are busy they forward their calls to the call center, understandable..evening....dinner time...understandable. Took the pizza to the store on our way out. Got to the store, empty parking lot, one mother and child were entering as a family of 4 was leaving. Requested the manager, described my plight and she stated that when they are busy the calls are forwarded. I looked around the restaurant and there was NO ONE but the one woman and child standing behind me. I looked at the manager and stated that was the worse excuse I have ever heard since the restaurant was EMPTY!!! I confirmed with a delivery guy that they were slow so what was the problem. A lazy manager that didn't want to be bothered by customers so she was having the calls forwarded. She gave me my money back and didn't even apologize, classy...

On the flip side, I tweeted about my experience and corporate responded immediately! They apologized and sent me a $20 gift card, kudos to corporate for taking care of this quickly.

Pizza Hut has good pizza and our service is usually pretty good but this location has been faltering over the years....."}
{"text":"Ordered online with Pizza Hut at 9:39pm, was routed to this store. Estimated delivery was 10:09, tried calling at 10:44 (store is \"open\" until 11) received message that store was closed. 
Checked my credit card statement, was charged and then refunded. 

I'm guessing they didn't feel like doing the delivery or even bothering to notify me. 

I won't do business with this store or any of the franchisee's stores again. The franchisee apparently is Aurora Huts LLC, which owns 55 (all?) of the Pittsburgh area Pizza Huts."}
{"text":"Poor Service. Place was very dirty and it was not busy. Ordered wings and it took 1 hour!! Horrible. They charge you for everything here, even your ranch?!? Do not recommend. Stay Away!!!"}
{"text":"I waited over an hour and an a half with no pizza to show for it. I only ordered it because it was my last resort. Then the person who was on the phone had an attitude with me and hung up on me. Tasteless service for tasteless pizza.  As a first time purchaser after relocating to Cleveland, will not be ordering from that terrible place."}
{"text":"If you're thinking of using the Pizza Hut online ordering system DON'T. 

Ordered my pizza tonight via website.  Ordered a large with several toppings. 

When order came, plain cheese pizza. 

Called and spoke with manager after being on hold for nearly 10 minutes.  He verified order via web was only a cheese pizza.  Told him there was an issue there and asked him to fix it.  He said only thing he could do was remake the pizza I wanted and charge me half price for it. 

I declined his offer as I'm already sitting here with a stone cold cheese pizza that I paid $16 for (10 pizza plus tax plus delivery fee plus driver tip). 

Very disappointed"}
{"text":"I've never had a correct order, or it finished anywhere near the estimated time. 
The last (very last) time I ordered takeout online around noon, when I got there they told me that the manager or whoever hadn't shown up that day, and for some reason the workers weren't able to make the pizza...or maybe the ovens take a while to fire up, I don't know, but I have no clue why they didn't call me when they got the order.
Other times only parts of my order have been done, they say \"oh well you can come back in an hour for said pizza/breadsticks/wings without even offering to send the delivery boy the whole mile over to my  house. 
But what can you expect from highschool kids with a manager that doesn't show up? Another cornelius place to cross of the list due to terrible staff."}
{"text":"Pizza hut really stepped their game up! The new menu and quality of food was amazing. Fast delivery and they loved that I put my name in as Walter Melon."}
{"text":"Ordered a pizza for carry out at 9p, store hours show as 11p. Show up to the store at 9:27 (right when my pizza is ready for pickup) and ALL the lights are off, doors are locked. I bang on the door, thinking someone must be inside just closing early and don't see anything. The front door even shows 11p for Sundays."}
{"text":"Fast delivery! Food was delivered 30 minutes from initial order; 1 large pizza, 2 medium pizzas, and cinnamon sticks. Quality of food consistent with the expectation of Pizza Hut."}
{"text":"Pizza is made differently at all sorts of places, but Pizza Hut creates the exact balance of cheese and sauce that I crave.  I have no problems with the quality of food 95% of the time and do not let that once- in- a- while \"off\" night ruin my lust for them.  Any time there has been a problem they sincerely listen and apologize and strive to make it up by a price break or free on the next order.  This is the way ALL businesses should operate.  That being said, I'm still miffed that they no longer offer bone-in breaded wings. I do not understand it.  Without the breading they are nothing special and something you can get anywhere.  When we wait one or two months between orders because it's not exactly on our healthy eating plan, I want to enjoy it to the max!  Please, Pizza Hut suits: consider bringing back the bone-in breaded wings.  It's not like you bread them by hand.  You still get them frozen in the little individual bags."}
{"text":"We ordered online and received an estimated delivery time of 1-1.5 hours, so we placed the order. When we checked out it changed our time to 2 hours. This is absolutely absurd for a delivery service."}
{"text":"If I could give this location 0 Stars I would. Every time we order from this location something goes wrong. Either the order takes 2-3 hours for delivery or something is missing or its cold and gross. Don't even think about calling this location back and possibly cancelling or changing an order, they never pick up their phone!! 

I have requested to speak to the manager on several occasions and have never heard back.  

This location is the absolute worst. Never order from them!"}
{"text":"We got the two medium pizzas for $6.99. We upgraded the one pizza to sweet siracha and it was not good. Very bland . Although the deluxe was amazing   Order was ready in 15 minutes as promised."}
{"text":"If I could rate no stars I would. I keep giving this place orders because of some of the advertised deals and online discounts I receive in email. After today, I will pay more for better service and food. In about 5 mins. I would have waited 3 hrs for my order and I am less than a 10 min drive away. Food consistently comes cold and service is slow, but this is terrible. I ordered an hour and 15 mins before the game started and its half time and I still don't have food. If you have to order pizza, consider Vocelli's, Pizza Belleno, or even Dominos."}
{"text":"I'm stuck-I really don't know what to rate these guys! We ordered take-out. I called in the order, and the guy that answered was very friendly and professional. I heard the other line ringing and I asked if he needed to answer it, and he said no, I was his only customer; which I thought was great. He said the pizzas would be ready in 15 minutes and confirmed the specifics of the order. Dave went and got the pizzas, and they were ready when they were supposed to be. So good service! 
I haven't had Pizza Hut in a long time; but I expected the quality to be consistent with my past experience. I grew up on Pizza Hut, we used to drive to the next town (7 miles) over for this treat (yes, I'm from a rural place)...and no matter how long the time passes, it's always that same greasy crust I know I shouldn't be eating, but yet I love to eat it. Anyways, the veggies and topping were good quality, my only complaint is that the crust was too doughy; neither the pan pizza or the hand tossed were cooked long enough; which did lead to my disappointment. 
So why don't I know how to rate them? I love pizza and eat it all the time. If I was going to rate them on taste alone: 2.5 (doughy crust); service: 5; uniqueness: 2; however consistency, turn-around time and service in this location was good tonight! So they earn 4 stars; hopefully they will adjust the cooking times in he future! It's not gourmet, and I've definitely have had better, but it's decent."}
{"text":"2 Thumbs Down! I always do Online ordering from other pizza places and never had a bad experience till now. They never got my pizza order right and on top of that i wasn't the only one they messed up other people before me that was picking there pizza up there orders were messed up too. All i can say is stay away from this place because obviously making pizza is Rocket Science and there not qualified! #smdh#fail#booo"}
{"text":"We were reluctant to visit this Pizza Hut locations after reading the reviews.  However, I'm glad that giving in to a pan pizza craving won out!

We were seated promptly and informed of the current promotion (5 bucks, 5 bucks, 5 bucks) by our server.  We ordered two pizzas and a meal sized salad to share.  The salad was quite large.  Our pizzas arrived at just the right moment after we had been given enough time to finish our salad.  The pizzas were fine and well prepared.  Really, they were Pizza Hut at its best.  Service was attentive and we had no complaints at all in that area."}
{"text":"Long wait time, Waited 45 minutes for order. I requested the pizza be well done, it was actually under cooked and soggy. Will never order from there again."}
{"text":"Gentleman at register was very kind, but beyond that, it stands that pizza hut has seen better years... I recall ordering a large pizza years ago and being able to satisfy a family of four with a bit more to spare. But now, it not only lacks in size, but in flavor, thickness, and toppings. The actual pizza was as thick as cardboard. The toppings were skimped out on and looked as if they were rationing. Please save your 15 to 20-or so dollars because the quality has dipped over the years and it is just atrocious.

TL;DR cardboard pizza, skimped toppings, small portions, very pricy. Eat elsewhere."}
{"text":"This is our total \"go to\" pizza delivery place. Fast service with piping hot delicious pizzas! Who could want more than that? Not sure why the ratings are not higher as we have never been disappointed."}
{"text":"Horrible services and they are all bitches never again ruin the order and we still have tp pay full price"}
{"text":"I love pizza and would consider Pizza Hut my favourite chain. This location on Morningside happens to be the closest and most convenient for me. Unfortunately, this location also has the worst quality of pizza I have ever had. Almost every time I've ordered there, the pizza has had no cheese and/or is undercooked. Last time I decided to show the staff my pizza with no cheese. They apologized and made a new pizza, which is now undercooked AND still had no cheese. If you enjoy eating dough and pizza sauce I would highly recommend this place. As for me, I'm never going back. Life's too short for less than mediocre pizza."}
{"text":"THIS REVIEW IS ONLY FOR THIS VISIT.This is the first time I have visited this pizza hut and not had any issue. Their customer service here is HORRIBLE. Kenyon took my order; he was sooo processional and courteous. Very nice young man. This is what what you expect when you visit an establishment where you're spending your hard earned money. Thank you Kenyon keep up the good work."}
{"text":"This place is 5 mins from the house I baby sit at. I ordered a personal pan pizza and cinnamon sticks.... they took over an HOUR to deliver it! The old delivery man was really nice when he came to the door thought. I don't know what to think about this place."}
{"text":"I love Pizza Hut, it's just this specific location that upsets me.  

First of all, there's a lady there named Donna and she has messed up our order once and honest to #$%* takes forever to do something.  She's just not very bright.  Sorry bout it. 

Another thing, the bathroom in there was nightmarish scary, and the whole restaurant smelled terrible when it should smell like delicious pizza and stuff.  

I love Pizza hut and I will continue going there because it's the closest one to my house, but not as often as I would probably.  Side note, I love the p'zone's but only cheese ones, and it makes me an extra happy customer when the workers (never at this location) offer putting in more cheese at no charge to make up for the lack of ingredients.

OH and another important thing, backing up that the lady there is not very bright.  She once told us that they were \"out\" of P'zones, like they come in frozen or something.  I'm pretty sure they make them by hand, fresh, do they not??  I mean, they don't even offer only cheese ones as a menu option, so if they came in frozen don't you think that would be impossible to order one??   Sonofabitch..."}
{"text":"HORRIBLE service received yesterday. I had to repeat my order probably five times to the gentlemen that took my order via phone, \"two medium pizzas with honey siracha DRIZZLE on top and a cheese personal pan pizza.\" I checked the pizza when I got there and it seemed fine however when I finally got home and bit into the pizza I realized instead of the honey siracha DRIZZLE I ordered for on TOP my WHOLE pizza was honey siracha sauce, so NO marinara sauce....didn't even know you could order it like that or even know who would. It's a shame because I order offen, myself online usually, and the two times I have called to place the order to use my daughter school \"free personal pan pizza coupon\" that same gentlemen screwed my order up each time. Will go to papa johns now!"}
{"text":"I tried to get a delivery on 3 separate occasions. In all instances, they called me and cancelled the order. The first time it was because they didn't have anymore dough left, the second because the delivery driver went back home early, and the third because, again, they didn't have anymore dough left. 
If anyone's wondering, on the occasions where they didn't have dough, I placed the order fairly early in the evening - it wasn't like it was late at night, which might excuse their poor planning of food. But nope, it was early evening; the time when most people order.
Sigh... never ordering from them again."}
{"text":"I love this Pizza Hut the service is great the employees are nice, the location is very clean and the pizza alone is great. Wings are awesome and the pasta is also great. I would recommend this location to any one and the delivery is also awesome, fast and the pizza always gets here on time. Thank you Pizza Hut"}
{"text":"Seriously the worst pizza hut I've ever ordered from. Granted we rarely order pizza so I've had limited experience with them but the past couple of times have been so bad. They take FOREVER to deliver. It shouldn't take more than an hour to make and deliver a pizza. The last time we ordered they actually called us to say that something happened with their computers and our pizza was never started then when the pizza came (way over an hour after we initially ordered) it wasn't even fully cooked, it was super doughy and undercooked. Today we ordered again and it's been over an hour since we ordered and still sitting here hungry. They don't even offer a discount or anything to make up for sucking so much. Just atrocious service and I cannot understand how a place can be so disorganized and slow. I'm super happy a new pizza place is opening up in DeForest so I don't have to give pizza hut more of my business."}
{"text":"Had to wait over 30 minutes for 2 personal pan pizzas.  Only after I asked, did the waitress tell me they were really busy with takeout orders.  I would have thought that people in the dining room would be served asap.  Guess not."}
{"text":"Yea this Pizza Hut sucks. They can't even deliver food so why have the option to order deliver if you're never gonna come and drop off the food. And what's even worse when I called they put me on hold and never got to be. Don't eat their shitty pizza. If they can't even deliver pizza they can't make pizza"}
{"text":"If you cant even take a simple order correctly, what chance do you have in life? Do not waste your time with this place. It is Vegas but do not gamble with your pizza here. The reviews are in and the odds are terrible."}
{"text":"AWFUL service at this location. First my order was processed as pick up instead of delivery, then when I called the dispatchers back, they took down my address wrong. I finally get a call from a delivery driver, who barely speaks English and cannot understand the directions to get to my unit. Each time I spoke to him on the phone he was rude and hung up on me. After 10 minutes of walking up and down my street looking for him I finally understand that he has been sent to the wrong address. I waited a little longer then called the restaurant location to talk to them and see if they could help me. Everyone I spoke to on the phone was extremely unhelpful to the point of incompetence. The driver finally reached my building and refused to come to my unit door, so I had to go meet him. I paid for delivery then practically picked up my order. The driver had the nerve to ask \"Any tips?\". By the time we got our order the pizza was cold and soggy and we had waited an hour."}
{"text":"Ordered a pizza online...original pan pizza with stuffed crust. What was delivered was not what we were expecting. Called and spoke with the manager Mike who proceeded to argue with us...no apologies, no offers of a credit. We won't be ordering from them again."}
{"text":"I am only 5 min away from this location...have waited 90 min for a pizza on a Tues past the normal lunch rush.  Called and was told my pizza was 2nd on the drivers stop even tho the tracking app notes my pizza was on its way 45 min prior.  Also, told driver was delayed because precious stop took at long time to come to the door?  Hungry, annoyed and pissed.  Still no pizza."}
{"text":"Staff was cool. Pizza was not. Seemed like it was over cooked, hardly any cheese on it, and tasted tough. will go somewhere else next time."}
{"text":"I have been dealing with thomas for a very long time now. I have spent literally thousands of dollars at this location. And every,single,  time there is always an excuse. Wrong orders. Wrong toppings,wrong flavors, people dropping our food at our door and having to go back for more, order 24 wings and get 12. Really basic stuff that even my 6 year old could handle. Now I find they won't even deliver to my house after 5pm? What the hell is that? Thomas claims it was because a driver got assaulted in my area. And he also said that it would be temporary.  Apparently now it's a store policy not to bring me food after 5 pm. Does he really think people won't assault his drivers because of daylight? No matter where you go no matter what time.  You always have the possibility of being assaulted. I hate this location. I hate the team here, always rude very rude. And thomas, you need to learn better management skills, you suck. Don't agree ? You have my number and address come see me"}
{"text":"I've been ordering from this Pizza Hut for a while now, and I can honestly say that I have recently seen a sharp decline in quality of the food. The workers are pleasant, and they arrive quickly, but the food sucks. I just ordered cinnamon sticks tonight, and they are falling apart. They are crumbly and all of the cinnamon falls off when I pick it up. I've had this problem in the past, but I usually just call them and they have no problem replacing my order. (Like I said, quality service.) But at some point, you get kinda tired of calling them and having them remake your food that they should have made properly in the first place. I'm super disappointed, to be honest. If the cooks were better this would be a 5 start review."}
{"text":"Never got the food. after ordering the 2 pizza boxes, we waited over an hour. Upon calling them they had no answer except that the pizza was out to delivery.the manager was a complete jerk and wouldn't help either.not even a sincere apology.\"all I can say is sorry, what else?\" I can't believe how unprofessional this place is.when I asked that I would like to cancel the order, all he said was\"sure\" . No offer to refund, reduce the bill(which was$59) or future credits. I've written to Pizza hut so let's see what happens"}
{"text":"My husband ordered a large pan pizza with 1/2 pepperoni and 1/2 plain (simple right), well it gets delivered with ALL pepperoni, which I cannot eat.  So he calls them and speaks with manager who was non-compiant. I do have to laugh because I have the receipt that states 1/2 pepperoni and 1/2 pepperoni, who works there, if I wanted all pepperoni that's how it would have been ordered.  I will never order from pizza hut munhall again and I will spread the word, horrible service ALL around, better pizza down the road anyway!"}
{"text":"First time great and reasonably priced for fries, boneless buffalo wings and dips.  Second time was good, third time was okay, overcharged for same thing and didn't even get the waffle fries.  This fourth time is the last time.  The person I spoke to had no clue what I was talking about and had to ask every time I asked her a question, I got the boneout with very little sauce, a luke warm dip that was disgusting and it was delivered in such a short period of time and looked like it had been sitting there all day.  Don't go here."}
{"text":"Called to ask if they deliver to the Econo lodge and was hung up on. Called back and the same woman answered, I think she said her name was \"nari\" pronounced Na-r-eye. She deliberately hung up on me again when I asked if they deliver to the Econo lodge."}
{"text":"The worse food and customer service I have ever received. Placed a carry out order and the pizza had no cheese and was over cooked. The boneless wings were hard as acorns and just as tasteless swimming in too much sauce. After arriving home and opening the boxes I called for a remake and was told they would remake the pizza for free but not the wing. I ended up speaking a few colorful metaphors &@$?&@\"& and informed them that I would return both and demanded a refund. On my way I called Barros's and picked it up after getting my cash back. Never go to the Cactus n Bullard or the Bell n Reems location in Surprise. Actually Pizza Hut in general sucks! They need to teach better quality control and customer service skills to employees. Five -negative star rating."}
{"text":"I give this place 1 because of the 2 separate occasions. my pizzas were mostly sauce and very little toppings then when I confront them about it they say they can't do nothing about it. People DO NOT I REPEAT DO NOT go here completely ripoff"}
{"text":"Worst pizza place around. Constantly out of stuff and had to cancel order twice."}
{"text":"Worst pizza ever!    My pizza was under cooked and the bacon that was on it was still raw and chucks of fat!    This location the cashier was very rude and the other employees were so unprofessional.   Will NEVER eat at this location again....furthermore will NEVER eat Pizza Hut again.   So disappointing because we used to like Pizza Hut.   Disgusting to say the least and that is putting it mildly!"}
{"text":"I felt compelled to write a review because all of them were so negative. The first time we ordered from there we had a GREAT experience. Good service, fast delivery, and great pizza. I thought maybe we just had a fluke good experience since all the other reviews were so bad. So we ordered again yesterday, and same thing. They told us the delivery time to the minute and the girl over the phone I believe was in a call center but was very polite. Their buffalo chicken pizza is incredible. We will continue to order from them often."}
{"text":"This place is a joke! Pizza is never ready. Saying I'm sorry for waiting for over two hours for a pizza isn't really asking to much is it ???"}
{"text":"This place is fucking terrible! The stupid little dumb fat bitch manager is the worst! Food was overly greasy and undercooked. I saw the manager handle money, then walk in the back and handle pizza toppings. Don't support this Pizza Hut location and hopefully a mom and pop spot will open in it's place."}
{"text":"Our local PH location, friendly bunch of folks, customer service is excellent. They make good food here."}
{"text":"Worthless. Ordered pizza and pasta for delivery. Took over an hour despite being a few minutes away. Pizza was completely dried out and room temp. Pasta was dried over as well. They provided no plates or silverware despite delivering to a hotel so we had to source those ourselves which wasted even more time. 30 bucks down the drain. Tried to reheat the pizza but it was uneatable."}
{"text":"The place is dirty and the service is the worst. They make pizza with bare hands (which i think is the same case for all other pizza place) but the problem is that they also handle cash and computer at the same time. They do not have dedicated cashier at the place. Seemed so dirty that I did not eat my pizza. Also, the general manager of the place is so rude, so loud, and so sneaky. He has no logic. When a customer said he ordered a small one when he was given a large chocolate dunker, the manager said that he can only charge for large since they made large and that he was so busy to argue. The customer asked why he has to take reponsibility when the mistake was made on Pizza Hut side. The manager answered that he did not take the order so it was not his fault and that he was so busy to argue. The customer was so ridiculed and left the place while shaking his head. While the manager spoke this, he was terribly loud that the customer did mot want to continue any further. I was very angry at the manager even though it was not my business. And I was waiting for my tiny order for more than 30 minutes. He repeatedly confirming my order with loud voice and smirky smile as if he was trying to get on my nerve. Both My girlfriend and I felt that he was trying to make fun of us. He said he was only trying to communicate but we knew that was not all. I was so mad that I shouted at him to stop repeating the same question and when I was leaving the place I heard him saying \"fuck you\" so I shouted at him saying the same thing. And then he followed me out to continue to argue with me. He said he was only trying to communicate and told me to get the fuck out of the place and that he would call the police. This is the worst restaurant experience I had in my whole life. The place is dirty, the pizza is dirty, their service is terrible and the manager is the worst!"}
{"text":"Complete and total joke. TERRIBLE service. TERRIBLE management. TERRIBLE product. Do yourself a favor avoid this place. Because of the fact this Pizza Hut is allowed to exist by Pizza Hut standard and be the complete shit hole that it is for years I vow to never consume Pizza Hut ever again."}
{"text":"do yourself a favor and find another pizza location. 
I am a ten minute drive from this location. order was supposed to take an hour and fifteen minutes. when it was a half hour late I called and the manager said they called and were at my door. 
I've had no calls and was on my porch all day, only person who showed up was the mailman.
the manager then called me back and said he believed his driver was lying and he was - as a courtesy to me - going to rewarm my two hour late pizza in the oven and send it over to me as soon as possible."}
{"text":"No one is wearing gloves. I've waited about over an hour to get my food. Horrible service"}
{"text":"We arrived at 630pm on a Wednesday night. Patricia was our server. There were only two other tables full, but Patricia seemed happy, busy, and pleasant. She greeted us promptly and took our order quickly. Our drinks were served immediately and our food shortly after. We have no reason to complain and felt the food and servuce was great."}
{"text":"I called to order a pizza from this location, and because of issues I have had with delivery from chains in the past, I made sure to ask if they delivered to my cross streets AND verified with my address. They stated they did deliver to my address, so I put in my order and half an hour later, received a call to verify my address... Then 5 minutes after that I received a call stating they do not deliver to my address. They had already charged my card and told me it would take 3 to 5 business days for the refund to process. I asked them why they took money from my bank account if they were not able to deliver to my address, and was told that they put in the incorrect address... An address that is just 5 minutes from my place of residence. When I asked for a corporate number or for a manager, I was told they are not a corporation. However when I then called another Pizza Hut, I was given the corporate number with no issue. Ashley, the manager at this pizza Hut, lied to me. I believe the number she gave me for her \"district manager\" is probably just her friend so she can keep herself from getting in trouble for her horrendous customer service. Totally disgusted."}
{"text":"Second time ordering from here and what a huge disappointment.  The pizza came cold, the toppings and cheese were next to nothing, and  the cheese was burnt.  Nothing worst than being ripped off!"}
{"text":"Worst customer service.  They couldn't even get my phone number right.  Pizza order was wrong and they told me it was my fault.   Pizza sucked. Service sucked.  Never going back"}
{"text":"Ordered online. 2 medium pizzas, breadsticks, and wings. They somehow got every single one of them wrong. Completely wrong topping, wrong crust. Brought breaded wings instead of traditional. And no breadsticks. Should have known better than to order from Pizza Hut but I just got home from a long work trip and needed something quick and easy. Never again."}
{"text":"I wish it were possible to leave 0 stars.  I don't even know where to begin.  First, the woman in front of me had her order messed up and was overcharged by over $10.  They wouldn't fix the price because they \"had already cashed the order.\"  This is what happens when you employ 16 year olds to run the cash register.  Secondly, while waiting for my pizza, the manager was screaming at his employees saying they should have things ready and they could if they weren't F***ing ret**ds.  There were children in the lobby and I was mortified for those parents.  Third... while I was leaving I was almost rearended twice by a delivery driver-- did you know there are stop signs in the parking lot?  Huh.. strange.  Well then he cut off two drivers on Blue Diamond and did not use a turn signal once.  I wrote down his license plate number in the event anyone is interested.  I was absolutely disgusted by the experience I had, and it's a shame because the pizza is well priced and always tasty."}
{"text":"Pizza Hut has to be one of my favorite pizza places. Besides the crazy mixtures like cheese crust and pretzel bites, most of the time that I go I have wonderful customer service and always get my order correct. Only thing I have bad to say about it is that delivery takes foreverrrrrrrrrrrr."}
{"text":"My pizza was delivered on Sunday night at around 6:05 pm June 16th. The pizza delivery boy was super friendly and personable, but the pizza was mediocre. I only have two stars because one of my pizzas was suppose to have mushrooms on only half of the pizza and they put it on the whole pizza so my little brother couldn't eat that one. They were very scarce with the toppings all together. I also requested for my wings to be all flats. I put it in the special requests two times and they still didn't care to listen to my request. I paid $30 plus tipped the delivery guy, like I always do, and a delivery fee, so I expect to get what I ordered."}
{"text":"This pizza hut I m recommending because the staff is very friendly and fast. Food very fresh. I love this Pizzahut."}
{"text":"I really wish you could give 1/2 stars or no stars on yelp. WORST pizza I have ever had in my life. Hey and that's saying a lot where I am concerned. Our company had a variety of 10 different kind of pizzas delivered for lunch today. I tried the Hawaiian, pepperoni, and meat pizzas.

The quality was poor, the crust was like cardboard, and they skimped on the toppings. I actually didn't even finish a whole slice, when I got to the edge of the crust I just could not eat it. There was barely enough cheese on the pepperoni slice to cover the sauce. I have had good pizza from pizza hut before, but avoid this location if your life depends on it."}
{"text":"Today I spoke with Monica the manger she is very rude because I explained that when she took my order I asked for pepperoni and chicken and was charged for two topings being on the same side when I clearly ordered the large two topping pizza (huh)I guess...yes a 1.49 fee so okay well the deal also includes 8wings / bread sticks wtf no wings arrived. So I called her reason was they where out of stock You took my order as a manager you weren't awear of this and my bf paid for the food because we had three boxes thought it was all correct NO we got 2 med cheese n chicken pizzas with cinnamon sticks as I was speaking with Monica the manager (says Kimberly on my receipt) she's yelling at me as I'm asking for the corporate number and asking for my money back because I paid cash I will have to drive up to the store I told her when i did I didn't want to deal with her she said she wouldnt help me anyway....worst service ever given by a manager I've ever experienced in 28 years of ordering pizza hut. She puts be on hold to get the number and says my GM just walked in with chicken wings we can make them for you now I asked her why is she playing games a work that made her super mad she began yelling again I asked to speak with someone else she then said No one will speak with you and hung up in my face."}
{"text":"TURN BACK. RUN. SAVE YOUR MONEY. I have been a long time customer of pizza Hut so I know the standard for pizza Hut pizzas. The pizza that I recieved was absolutely unnaceptable. There was extremely little toppings, sauce, and there were holes in the pizza. I know I got the sale items, so a little deviation from the gold standard will be expected; but the pizza I recieved was so lacking, that it bordered what can only be felt like a scam.

I felt scammed out of my money."}
{"text":"Pizza was raw! Do not order from this place. The middle was raw. We just threw it away."}
{"text":"AVOID - Doesn't even deserve a one star. After an hour of waiting for an order, we called and they said it would take 2 hours or longer. We had already been waiting for an hour for a delivery that was less than 3 miles away. We then drove to the restaurant and upon arrival they let us know that our order was on its way. By the time we got home the pizza was there. What kind of joke establishment is this?"}
{"text":"Whenever we order pizza from here, it's always undercooked in the centre, all doughy and gross. They claim it's because too many toppings are put on but if you have a special for a large pizza with 5 topping for $12.99, you should be able to cook a large pizza with 5 toppings properly."}
{"text":"The food was good but the restaurant was so dirty it was disgusting. There was dried pop on the window frame and wall. All of the seats were also ripped.  Don't mention the bathroom."}
{"text":"This location needs to improve their quality control and care about their customers and reputation. They seriously skimped on our pizzas. Who messes up cheese pizzas or pepperoni???  Those are basic!  We bought a lot for a party and when we got home we were shocked to see they barely had any sauce on them and they did not put many toppings on them. We needed to feed our guests so we kept them. It was like eating bread.  I convinced my wife we should spend more nah get Pizza Hut instead of Little Caesars Hot n Ready. I wish we had stuck with Little Caesars. It would at least they would have had pizza sauce on them."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place. The new manager is amazing and fixed all of our problems we had before. Their pizza is nice, fresh, and delicious. One thing I definitely recommend is their Chicken Wings. I go there at LEAST once a week to get the chicken wings. Boneless bites with burnin hot Buffalo sauce, best thing I've had in my life and my favourite food. The staff are very friendly and I get perfect and fast customer service every time."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery, was told 45 minutes. After 1.5 hrs I called to see what was up. They told me the driver was on his way. Another 30 minutes later the pizza arrives, it's cold to the touch. No exaggeration. I phone the location and complain, but ask for a reasonable credit for a free pizza next time. The lady on the phone says yes of course, there is a credit for a free pizza under your phone number- call us direct or come into the store to redeem. So today I go in there to order my free pizza, and surprise, only a $4 credit under my phone number. I explain the situation to the guy at the till, and he just says \"too bad, we don't have any record of that\". I'm annoyed at that point but he won't budge. So I order the $10 online special (on my phone while in the store because he won't honour it over the counter), then he tries to tell me I can't use my $4 credit. Needless to say, I used my $4 credit. While I was waiting for my pizza another customer ordered and was charged $6 for a 600 ml bottle of pop until he realized the giant price difference from the pizza and called the guy out. This location needs new management. Terrible customer service. We will never go back."}
{"text":"Placed an order for delivery at 10:15 and the store closes at 11:00. I got a call from the manager saying he needed to cancel my order because because they had other orders before mine and wouldn't have time. The estimated delivery time is 25-35 minutes on the app which would be well before closing. He was unapologetic and when I suggested sending another worker out to finish deliveries or maybe staying open a bit later to fulfill orders, especially because right now is obviously a very busy time for business so why close at the peak? He quickly said no he can't and was obviously only giving one option. No apology, no rain check, no empathising. Just nope, we can't. Bad business and bad look on this store and its choice in management. Not being willing to stay open maybe an extra 10 minutes just shows the poor amount of enthusiasm and work ethic in that store. That patheticism probably would have shown in the quality of my food so I'm happy to cancel."}
{"text":"I was told by the cashier that we could not place the order because they were about to close. It was 10:11 pm and they close at 11:00 pm. Very upset we drove to be told that we were not able to place an order. Had never encountered that with a business. There was no sign stating that they dont take orders after certain time.:("}
{"text":"Wow, terrible..... Just bad... This is THE example of what is wrong with chains. You want a $10 pizza? In this case $11, here is what you get.  MINIMAL CHEESE  even my server was commenting on the lack of cheese on 1 side. She said they just had a big meeting about the cheese. They were told not to go over the set cheese limit no matter what. Ridiculous. Then my pizza was soaking with that pizza pan spray butter crap, that does not even taste like butter anymore. Got my kids a rootbeer, it was flat. Save your money. I was so mad because I drove 8 miles up the 303 strip passing all kinds of pizza places to go here so I could sit down with my kids.  They gave me $2 off my whole bill after an extensive complaint. Pitiful :((((((("}
{"text":"What can I say it's a Pizza Hut.    The Pizza is most likely the best of the Chain Pizza places.  Of course either either have to love deep pan Pizza or you will think Pizza Hut is way too Greasy and head over to Pizza Pizza to have card board covered with Red Paint.  Personally I find Pizza hut kind of hit and miss.  It really depends on location such as this one and the short order cooks they have that night and if they care at all.  At their best this location is good,  when they are too busy and there staff doesn't care then it's like playing at the Casino sometimes.  

The spray on butter which the other reviewer commented on doesn't bother me as they spray it on the crust which helps season the crust as well as soften it a little.  If you don't want your Pizza seasoned as such (I highly recommend you do or else you go else where) then I'd tell the server as much.  

Again you have to remember this is a Pizza Hut a chain store.  All in all I know their are better Pizza Hut's in the city but this is an OK, Good enough when desperate Pizza Hut.  Nothing great here to make it stand out."}
{"text":"Honestly had a great experience answered the phone professionly delivered food on time and it was good so 5 stars I got the stuffed crust pepperoni pizza with some wings medium it was even hot so if you like pizza hut style pizza this place will do"}
{"text":"To start, I would absolutely give negative stars if possible. I ordered a pizza from this location at 10:04pm with an estimated delivery time of 30 minutes. After 1 hour of waiting, I received a call from what I believe to be the manager. He says that he has no driver, and canceled my order. Didn't receive an offer for a rain check, or for me to come get the pizza for free. Just \"I canceled your order.\" I will never give this location my business ever again. Shocking to me that a location can receive so many bad reviews and still be open."}
{"text":"Great pizza, good delivery and pickup deals, not dining area.  Overall,  good customer service."}
{"text":"I usually don't order from pizza hut. It's expensive compared to others. Sorry I did -  what a waste of money. I ordered a thin crust that had very little cheese , was cold, looked like it sat around on a shelf for awhile. Won't be ordering from them again."}
{"text":"Our phone order had to be explained 10 times, which was two medium supreme thin crust and one large thin crust with mushroom and sausage. When I arrived much to my dismay only two where ready. I was told a additional pizza would take 1 1/2 hours. Not only was I short one pizza but the large was not what was ordered. I do not think I will be ordering again from Pizza Hut. Lousy customer service."}
{"text":"Unfortunately this Pizza Hut was our favorite... And I stress \"was\"!  My kids loved the pan and thin cheese... Always perfect under the past manager.  But the last few months since that managers transfer it's just been horrible!  First if all the employees just don't seem to care if the customer is happy and they don't want to hear requests like \"light sauce\" or \"please don't over cook\".  My kids have Sensory issues and cannot handle hard burnt crusts or 4x the sauce.

Since I'm a working mom to two sets of twins my husband is sometimes in charge of dinner time.  Normally this means it's a Pizza Hut dinner for the kids.  So He tried again last Saturday night 9/27/14 and ordered our two favorite cheese pizzas... They were both over cooked and the thin crust cheese pizza looked like it was made the week prior; cheese all dried up &/or burnt.  So he kindly asked then to remake only the thin crust; even though both should have been redone.  Well the staff got our whole family back and our remade thin crust pizza wasn't hardly cooked; it looked almost all white. My husband felt bad to complain a 2nd time so he brought it home.  Needless to say I still had to make a late dinner for the kids since they were starving after NOT eating the pizza my husband brought home; I wish he would have done the same.

He had a few slices of the uncooked pizza and spent the night passed out in the bathroom... Yep; Food poisoning!!!

So watch what you ask for; they know how to get the picky customers back.  I would have preferred  they'd spit on our pizza; at least that would have not made my husband so ill!!!"}
{"text":"This is the closest Pizza Hut to where I live. We've ordered here a few times. One time everything was perfect. The second time, our breadsticks were not the ones we ordered and paid extra for. We called and got a credit for a future order. The third time, the pizza was lukewarm and we didn't bother to call the store. The last time we ordered, our pizza was 10 minutes late, lukewarm (at best) and the breadsticks were not right. Keep in mind, I live about 1 mile away. I called the store and they gave a full credit, however there shouldn't be this many mistakes time and time again."}
{"text":"I read the poor reviews on here and I totally disagree. They charged me the correct price and delivered in 30 minutes. 5 stars baby! Plus the pizza was amazing! Don't forget to rate when you like things!"}
{"text":"They over charged me and refused to give me a refund saying I can have their advertised special next time."}
{"text":"We ordered a pizza with spinach and look what they did... Threw raw spinach on top of the pizza!!! We also called and got hung up on!!! Great service right? Not even a 1 STAR. HORRIBLE. THE WORST EVER!"}
{"text":"Worst service. I order pizza which is suppose to be delivered in 30 minutes. After an hour I call to check on it. The person who answers clearly has no idea what to do so he just hands the phone off with out saying anything. The lady who gets on the phone doesn't know anything so after I explain it to her she tells me she doesn't keep track of the drivers once they leave the store so she doesn't know where my pizza is. After I ask that's it? She decides to not say anything so I have to ask her if she is still on the phone. Great customer service you guys should really work on that considering you guys are right out side of mountains edge and have 2 stars."}
{"text":"I had to repeat and correct the order multiple times... I think the employees hired for this store must have been from the bottom of the barel.. They also couldn't deliver because the adress wasn't in there system."}
{"text":"Have enjoyed all my experiences at this location... I personally don't use delivery for the fact I live down the street, but going in and picking up my order is always good."}
{"text":"I have ordered here several times and always enjoyed 5 star pizza.  The wings are also good but I haven't ordered them there for quite some time.  I like to try wings from different restaurants."}
{"text":"This pizza hut is by far the worst I've ever tried, the orders are never right even through online orders, lack of customer service experience, the manager is completely useless like he has no idea what he's doing, plus delivery is always way later than its supposed to by hours do yourself a favor save your $ for a better restaurant"}
{"text":"My boyfriend loves this place and I don't mind it either. How can you really go wrong with pizza anyways? Delivery is always on time and never once have they got an order wrong. Don't know why there is such a low rate of reviews on here, but for a Pizza Hut it's pretty good."}
{"text":"fanny ... what can i say !!! awesome !!! on time, good personality, and fun !!!"}
{"text":"One star is too kind of a review. I wish that we could give negatives. The worst experience ever! Not professional and poor customer service. I ordered some pizzas and they were under cooked. Still doughy inside. I called and received a credit. When I used this credit the next day, it took them almost two hours to deliver my food which was cold. Never ever experienced this before! Terrible"}
{"text":"Ordered 2 med. pizzas and were delivered in about 24 mins. Sweet ! Nice and hot. Way to go."}
{"text":"This is the worst pizza hut I have ever been. Today I ordered at 12.06 and then an hour later manager says pizza was out for delivery and 20 minutes later when called back they say I never placed order. It doesn't end here.. when I checked my credit card they already charged it. So I visited store and showed them why the charged my card. They didn't even bother to apologize."}
{"text":"Luckily my mother in-law answered and paid because I would have sent the entire order back. Tey told me 50 mins on the phone and literally 1 1/2 hours later it arrived just as I was makinh some oter food for my kid cause he was starving....then to top it off they gave us the wrong order. Last time I order from this restaurant. Oh and when I oredered I was put on hold for 5 mins until I had to hang up and re call them. Wtf???"}
{"text":"Unfortunately, customer service is not tops here. I called asking for assistance with an order and was told they were \"too busy.\" However, once I arrived, the store was empty and several employees were walking around. I just wanted 6 pizzas for my students who scored mastery on their tests, but Pizza Hut wasn't able to find the time to take my order."}
{"text":"Okay, it's finally time I review this establishment. I just can't remain quiet any longer. Here goes: Pizza Hut wins my vote hands down!!! I'm a regular with Pizza Hut, ordering from this location at least once a month. And let me just say that each time I've ordered, I've been relatively satisfied. There was a couple of occasions where my order wasn't correct, but what I respect about Pizza Hut is that if and when you bring the issue to their attention, they take care of the customer by either replacing the item(s) or offering a credit. In regards to the latter, I've read reviews of various locations of Pizza Hut where the patron is upset about an error that was made with their order and how they were not offered a refund. But, I'm actually okay with that, as, like I stated above, I frequent Pizza Hut often and know that I can always make use of the credit in the future. In terms of delivery, sometimes there is a long wait (especially during one of their promotions). But, more often than not, delivery reaches my house within the time frame I was quoted. And on that note, I should mention that my daughter ordered delivery from Pizza Hut two weeks ago. It was on a Saturday, so I'm guessing that's why they gave her a 1 hr delivery time. However, her pizza didn't arrive until well past that. BUT...guess what? The next day, my daughter received an email from a manager/owner offering her a free large pizza because of their error. Customer service at it's finest!!!

Today, and the reason why I decided to get my review in, the delivery, the food, the customer service (yes, even though I ordered delivery) were all exceptional. I was quoted delivery between 30-40 minutes, and the food did arrive on time. I ordered two of their large 2-topping pizzas (sausage/pepperoni and pepperoni/pineapple) for $7.99 each, however I requested stuffed crust for one of the pizzas and so that incurred an additional $2 charge. Also, 1 order of cheese stuffed garlic knots for $5.99, 1 order of Cajun fries for $2.50, 1 8-piece  boneless buffalo wings (Only 0.60 cents each on Wednesday's!!!) and lastly 1 8- piece order of the boneless wings in lemon pepper dry rub. 

Everything was perfect. Each item was hot, the presentation was amazing, and it all tasted really fresh. There wasn't a lack of toppings on the pizzas (plenty of sausage, pepperoni, etc) the boneless wings, though some were dipped in their medium heat buffalo sauce, were so crispy, very meaty, decently sized, and moist on the inside. These wings were even crispy long after we received the food!! The Cajun fries too- very flavorful, crispy, hot, and you get a good portion for the price. Then there's the cheese stuffed knots. Those are yummy. The tops are sprinkled with Italian/Parmesan seasoning and the middle, of course, stuffed with cheese. I do wish that they'd put more cheese in the knots, but still they're good and for sure they'll always be a part of my future orders. I must say, one of the things I love about Pizza Hut's food is that all their food tastes just as good as it did when it was delivered, if not better, the next day after reheating. I typically order a large  quantity of food, so there's always leftovers, and my family and I really enjoy these.

Overall, I am just a very satisfied customer, as I usually am with Pizza Hut. The delivery driver's are usually always pleasant, as was the young man that delivered my food today. I have no complaints. Also, I want to add that I placed my order online, and I wanted to make some changes, so I called in to the Desert Inn location to ask if I could do so over the phone. The guy I spoke with was very polite and didn't seem irritated or bothered that I was making a new request to my order. Appreciate this so much because you don't always get employees/managers that are so accommodating and willing to listen and help, without giving the customer a hard time.

Anyways, so yes, Pizza Hut (Desert Inn) is my go-to!!Please don't ever change."}
{"text":"There was only one person working here. The wait time was ridiculous because of that. They either need to hire more people or put more staff on... don't treat your staff like slaves."}
{"text":"Is anyone reading the reviews from Pizza Hut????.  I use to manage one so I'm pro Pizza Hut. But the service was non existent, very dirty tables, the pan pizza was flat and soggy and not cooked, and it just sucked!!!If this was my restaurant, as an owner I would have my ass in here prepping dough, taking orders and cleaning the front of house from top to bottom before I went bankrupt! Thanks to the person who gave me half off on the food I didn't eat.   I only paid because I feel bad for the owner.   If you need consulting on how to run a restaurant I can help you.  Reply to this review and I'll point you in the right direction."}
{"text":"You guys suck!!!!! Two times I've called in to get pizzas and they were never delivered. In reading everyone else's comments a call to the corporate boss is in big order and is definitely on my to do list. The last time the kid who sounded like he was on drugs said we messed up someone else's order so we gave them yours! Really?? Totally pathetic but then again this is Pizza Hut... the only reason I buy your pizza is for my daughter. Bunch of druggies in that area!"}
{"text":"Such a horrible first time experience with this location specially from Kenny(manager) and Bianca. I just moved in a new community and it don't exist on the map. So I first called in to make sure what I needed to do since it don't exist on the map when you order online. I called and spoke with Kenny (manager) to verify if they deliver at my location by explaining to him my location and he said yes. He informed me to order online for the special and that he could change the address so order was in and called back to give current address and Bianca answered. I spoke with Bianca and informed her I spoke with Kenny(manager) about my location and now all of a sudden they are saying I'm located north of the cut off to where they deliver after confirming with the Kenny(manager). Added to that why wouldn't you listen to your customer when they are telling you and giving you directions of the location instead of looking it up on Zillow and google maps. You keep telling me you know for sure I'm located past the cut off delivery location when you haven't been here before and it's not on the maps and then the nerve you hang up on me. What a poor customer service. I always give the benefit of the doubt on yelp reviews until I've experienced this today, now I why this store has 2 stars. If I could give no stars to this location for a review that would be a big fat 0 stars. Kenny (manager) definitely needs some training for the way how you treat and talk to your customers. Kenny (manager) and Bianca you just need listen to what customers are telling you on location instead of assuming and looking it up on Zillow and google maps like you said on the phone. Also don't tell your customers to put a different address and correct it after the order has been placed and say you don't deliver to my location after the fact that I'm told a few minutes before the order was made that you do definitely deliver in this community after I told you the major cross street."}
{"text":"I was here on work from Washington and though pizza huts there are good why not.

I ordered pasta and breadstick and a large pizza

Pasta was messing wasn't cooked enough
Breadsticks look like the dough was outdated and looking like someone stepped on it. No care at all

Pizza was over loaded and soggy with grease.
This location has people who don't care about the food they are serving to their customers and this location should be shut down.

There's no excuse to send out shitty food"}
{"text":"After 9 years since the last time I ordered from this location due to POOR service, it appears that it has not changed. I thought I would give them another try due to there has been time for correction and nothing has changed. Ordered 2 medium pizza's at 05:31 and was not received until 07:01. Had called the location at 06:31 to find out the status of my order. I was told that it was there and disappeared. Thinking that my order was canceled which it was not. After on hold for approximately 5 minutes, then I was told the order was being delivered. Upon recieving the pizza's, the hand toss dough was not cooked properly (doughy and soggy). The other appear to be alright. I will not be giving my services to Pizza Hut again. I use to eat a lot of Pizza Hut at another location but this location REALLY sucks!! Poor training, poor guidence, poor management, all equals to poor location. Such a shame. Love the vairety that Pizza Hut offers."}
{"text":"Tuesday night- first of the month- the manager handled a customer on the phone complaint /request with one of the best attitudes that I have seen in the fast food industry in a long time - Def will be coming back"}
{"text":"In the 2+ years we've lived in range of this Pizza Hut, we have ordered from them almost weekly. As a rule, we tip pretty well.
You know how many times they have gotten our order right? ONCE. 
Sometimes it's little things I would overlook, like a missing sauce. 
On at least three occasions, they have left out an entire order of wings.
Once, I ordered carry-out, they forgot to put in my order of brownies, I waited 15 minutes at the store for them to rush it through, only to find out they'd neglected to put it in AGAIN.
Tonight, I was watching a show with headphones on, so I set an alarm 5 minutes before my estimated delivery time to make sure I'd hear the door. I was getting anxious (and a little bit hangry) so I kept walking to the door/window to check. My husband was watching the window from his computer. 40 minutes after our delivery time, we hadn't heard from them, so my husband called. Pizza Hut claimed it was sent back because the driver knocked, no one answered, so she called. There was no knock, and my phone never rang. Having worked at a Pizza Hut in high school, I don't exactly have high expectations. But this is either the most incompetent or most unexplainably spiteful crew I have ever heard of."}
{"text":"Boneless hot wings were good - plenty spicy hot. Almost too much seasoning, but good. The pepperoni P-Zones were undercooked and not the least bit crispy on the outside. It was good that they accidentally gave us double the marinara sauce, because the p-zones needed it. Very dough-ey. We got the food delivered and it took 75 minutes for delivery. Driver did apologize for delay and told me that they are short of drivers at the moment. Not the greatest, but the hot wings hit the spot."}
{"text":"This location is ALWAYS outstanding. I've ordered pickup and delivery from here numerous times and every time they've been quick and the pizza has been hot. Employees are always friendly and efficient. Chain restaurants aren't always my first choice, but this Pizza Hut is so convenient it's hard to pass up."}
{"text":"Ordered today and said is ready but actually not......food is as usual....but I went there like 20 mins after ready time just to avoid any waiting time on the order.....still made me stay there almost 30 mins saying need to make sure all orders are right......but it's Pizza Hut...what do we expect...."}
{"text":"0 stars!!!Worst restaurant I have ever been to the lack of customer service and the way we were treated yeah no coming back!! Rude staff dirty tables don't waste your time!"}
{"text":"Ordered a pizza by phone for pickup on a visit to Vegas to visit family. Order was to be ready at 5:36 pm.. I arrived at 5:32 pm and paid for the pizza. I sat down to wait. And waited. And waited. About 15 minutes into the wait, the register area was packed with people who were still waiting for very late orders. A young woman came from the back, hysterical, yelling at the cashier, \"I made them all! I made them! I just don't know where they are!\" 

Hilarity ensued and I got my pizza 19 minutes after it was supposed to be ready. Of course, it was cold by the time I got it back to my family's house 6 minutes away. 

I called the restaurant and, after a wait on hold, asked to speak to the manager. \"Brett\" said he would need an explanation of what I needed to talk about before he could put me through to the manager. I persuaded him to get the manager, a \"CSR\" whose name, I believe, was Sandy. She explained, \"I was one of the people back there trying to help find the pizzas and it was just really confusing.\" I declined to discuss excuses with the \"CSR\". She said that the next time I came in, she would give me a credit. Given that I live near Philadelphia, that was obviously not a great idea. She told me she could give me the owner's email address and I could tell him what happened. She then put me on hold for another 8 minutes. Then she came back to the phone, telling me \"I haven't forgotten about you. I'm just trying to get all the details right. I have to put you back on hold.\" 

I suggest another pizza vendor for my fellow Yelp users."}
{"text":"Ordered 2 pizzas clearly told the guy the toppings I wanted on them  and my wife got there to picked them up just for them to charge here before even showing her the pizzas were the correct order and to our surprise the wrong order and told her she could not get a refund and wait longer for them to fix their mistake  worse service ever will never go there again everyone make sure you check your order before you pay!!"}
{"text":"Spoke to a live person but my order never got entered, apparently. Ok no biggie. Happens. Called to check the ETA and the manager basically called me a liar saying that I never placed an order. What??? Maybe I was hallucinating ordering a pizza from Pizza Hut...."}
{"text":"The pizza I ordered was raw. The lady on the phone said I could order a new one but it would take a long time to arrive, or put a credit on my account and order the pizza again another time. I did the second option, and when I called to receive the pizza at a later date, they informed me I was not refunded the whole price I paid and just part of it. After asking to speak to the manager, they ended up giving me a brand new pizza without the extra cost. Poor customer service, a manager never came on the phone. Will not order from here again."}
{"text":"I ordered the $5 deal today. For the second time in a row I have really enjoyed the thin crust pepperoni pizza! I get the hut favorite crust which was a free upgrade.  They have a bunch of different free crust flavors to choose from   

Overall, this Pizza Hut is one of the best!

I like the sit down restaurant option as well.   I grew up with dine in Pizza Huts. With so many of them just doing delivery nowadays it's a nice change."}
{"text":"I just order for pizza delivery today and i am very disappointed with my order. First, i ordered two pasta and i only got one order of it and then when I open the pizza box my pizza taste burned( pineapple was burned ,crushed is burned too). This is upsetting I just want to enjoy my pizza now I have to wait another half an hour just to get the order right."}
{"text":"This place is garbage. If you want just grease and that's it go for it.  We just picked up our pizza honestly 15 minutes ago and it's burnt and covered in grease.  Don't waste your time. Just go up the street to Rocco's. It sucks you even have to leave a star."}
{"text":"I love Pizza Hut. I ordered a pizza and some wings around 1:30 pm, thinking it would be a nice treat on my birthday. Not at all. I waited an hour and a half for my pizza to arrive, but I figured, it's Saturday, maybe they're really busy. When the pizza finally arrived around 3 pm I opened the door to a not so friendly delivery driver. Once I open my pizza I immediately know it's old. The cheese was literally brown and the pizza was not warm at all. I called to let the manager know I would be bringing it back and expecting a full refund. He was actually really nice and understanding. Unfortunately, I had to start getting ready for work and ended up not having time to take it back. Total waste of money, the full pizza went to waste which is rare in my house. Won't be going back to this location and since this is the second time I've received an old, cold pizza from a Pizza Hut I may just find another pizza place period."}
{"text":"I love pizza hut, but the employees at this location  NEED TO FIX THEIR ATTITUDE. One complaint, that was THEIR own fault, and they give back attitude because they have to fix it, even if it was as simple as messing up an order. PLEASE let them know that THIS IS A JOB and if they're going to treat their customers that way, then they aren't mature enough to even have a job. PLEASE FIX THIS."}
{"text":"Ordered some quicky wings here the other day to satisfy my low carb diet.  They told me 20 minutes so I decided to just head over. I ordered 8 traditional wings hot.  They come in a minimum of 8 so I thought I would just split it into 2 meals.

So I walk in to pick up my order.  Immediately I was greeted with a \"Carissa?\".  Yep that's me!  He replied, \"thanks for giving us something to do\". LOL  I would imagine it would be tough at lunchtime being right next to a Tropical Smoothie, Port of Subs and a Starbucks.

The guy (I think the manager) was such a pleasant guy.  Not just because of his comment about not needing to be on a low carb diet.  haha  But it sure made my day.  I love personable people!

Got my wings back to the office.  Lots of sauce on them. Lots. Not particularly the least messiest thing to eat at work, but hey you gotta do what you gotta do under the circumstances.  The wings were flavorful and could be spicier but to the average person they were probably spicy.  It never seems hot enough for me.  

Overall customer service was amazing, the food was good and I didn't spoil my diet.  All around a winner!

BTW this is a Wing Stop located inside a Pizza Hut Delivery. =)"}
{"text":"Not even worth the one star. Literally the worst pizza I've ever had. Ordered a carry out Tuesday night around 9:15, picked it up no one came to the counter for a good 5 minutes then she came and turned around  said for me to giver her a minute and the pizzas were in the heater she turns around types something in the computer hands me a receipt to sign. I stayed to check and quickly make sure the toppings were correct and left. When we got home the pizza was so incredibly thin (we ordered stuffed crust) and hard, and to top it off the pizzas weren't even cut correctly. I will never be returning. Disgusting, and pitiful. The workers should be ashamed of themselves."}
{"text":"We often order pizza from Pizza Hut (mostly plain cheese pan crust) my family likes it. Last month we ordered for delivery. After 45 mins a white guy came. I took pizza and went to get money. When came back he stepped inside the house. I was kinda scared that moment. He was standing inside the house. I didn't like it. 
My bill was $13 and he asked how much money I want back??? 
He was really weird 
Better to pickup ur pizza"}
{"text":"Ordered online, entered cheese/peppers packets in the special instructions. App showed 20-30 minute delivery time.  Delivery took 58 minutes, no cheese/peppers packets either.  Driver acted like it was funny.  Shame.  There are way too many competitors out there to accept this poor service and product.  BTW the pizza was warm at best!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I are always pleasantly surprised by the service at this Pizza Hut. They teens that works here are all very professional and polite. We always opt
to order online and pick-up. Any dinner time order will take about 5-10min longer than the quoted time because they get so busy. 

My husband usually get a classic pepperoni pizza. I will sometime order a thin crust, with no cheese and extra sauce with veggies which is a \"lighter\" option when it comes to eating pizza."}
{"text":"Well if I would have reviewed this restaurant about two months ago it would have been a 2.  I have somebody in my house that has issues with tomato sauce and so when we order our pizzas one always has to be without sauce.  In the past management didn't care because they usually got it wrong.  Luckily Pizza Hut now has a pizza dippers which has no sauce.  We ordered it the first day it was out and the cooks weren't use to it so made it with sauce.  Luckily we did a chicken alfredo with it and my son was able to eat that instead of the pizza.  I called the manager and he understood and gave us a credit for the pizza and we were able to order it again a few days later.  This time it was made right.  The manager seemed really apologetic and that he cared.  Not the way it used to be.  So you might want to give this location another chance."}
{"text":"Wow love being told that I am wrong about getting a raw pizza.  So we decided to try the stuff crust pizza.  It appears to be raw, the consistency of when you bake rolls and take them out of the oven early.  Very doughy and undercooked.  It was also very very greasy for a pepperoni pizza.  Never had a pepperoni pizza this greasy and we only order pepperoni pizza about once a week so what do we, the customer know?  The manager said we were wrong but he would credit our account.  Guess we are eating from the competition tonight... what a shame... the manager Oscar could care less."}
{"text":"Horrible horrible experience pizza took forever to arrive & when it did delivery driver was very mean very rude pizzas were cold & very burnt tasted horrible very disgusting called to complain manager was rude also & showed no concern or did nothing to fix the problems this is by far the worst experience I've had with Pizza Hut I will never go there again & will be sure to tell all my friends & family to stay away from this place I'm very disappointed in Pizza Hut they  obviously don't care about they're customers at all if I could I'd give half a star this location is horrible. !!!!!!!"}
{"text":"We came in to place a carry out order. The manager was yelling at the cashier while we placed our order. They said 15min wait and we sat for 45 min waiting. When we went up to get an eta the 2nd manager said who are you, when did you place your order? Mind you she took our order... then she proceeded to tell us oh they forgot to make your order it'll be another 15min. Of coarse that didn't happen..... needless to say we left without our pizza, not without our refund of coarse. A little over an hour wasted sitting waiting...absolutely horrible customer service."}
{"text":"Just did a pickup order and the guy who answered the phone and took my order let me know of a deal and saved me a few bucks (always appreciated!). My order was correct and made super fast (15min) and the women working the front counter, Anita, was so sweet and friendly. I'll definitely be returning to this location. It really makes a difference when the employees are nice. People return to places with good customer service!"}
{"text":"I hate leaving poor reviews and typically will let mishaps go, but considering how I was spoken to and treated by these staff I have no reservations about this one. I ordered at 5:23p via the Pizza Hut app, after an hour, around 6:30p I decide to call to check in, get put on hold multiple times (not on actual hold though, like I could still hear them complaining about me on the phone), shuffled around to multiple \"managers\" who interrupted me as I spoke, and displayed unprofessional and borderline disrespectful behavior. They indicated that they had cancelled my order because \"my phone was off\". I had no voicemails, no missed calls, my email is listed on my order, and my home address was correct on the confirmation. I asked if there could be some compensation for the hour long mess-up (given I was not informed via any of the possible modes of communication available--including the app tracker that still said the order was being made-) and the response was \"A DISCOUNT!? OH HOLD ON.\" I was shuffled to another \"manager\" and I was told that it was my fault, because I didn't answer the phone (because I did not get a phone call) and that a \"manager called and said you didn't answer so I can't argue with a manager\". I am beyond confused at how rude and incompetent this staff was, considering I would have just waited & paid for the order again and tipped my drivers well, as I usually do. So, they lost out on profit, productivity, and now wages for their driving staff."}
{"text":"Worst Pizza Hut experience ever!!! My wife ordered online and gave me a verbal confirmation of what was being ordered - things were correct. Somehow during the ordering process it changed to two Hawaiian pizzas. I didn't notice this on the confirmation because I don't read any of the emails that come to the address it is sent to. Once we got the order and saw we had a duplicate of one pizza we called the store. We were faced with a combative manager who had no empathy to the situation. My wife was explaining the situation to the woman (Jael), who talked down to my wife to the point where I took over the call. I received the same combative behavior. Knowing I wasn't going to get anywhere with her, I requested a corporate number or her manager to call me. Allegedly, this call will happen in 48 hours. I understand that its a franchise but they are representing the brand of Pizza Hut. I can say this with a doubt I WILL NEVER order Pizza Hut again if this is how they treat their customers."}
{"text":"Worst Pizza Hut ever. Placed my order online 20 minutes early, then drove 10 minutes to get to the location, and the food wasn't even in the oven. The guy in the back making pizza not wearing gloves and taking forever to even like one pizza. 
I am at 40 minutes and still no pizza in sight.
I will never order from this location again.
Doesn't even deserve one star but had to press it to enter a review."}
{"text":"I honestly wouldnt give them no stars but i guess its not giving me a choice those people they were so rude i ordered 3 pizzas with delievery one hour later still no pizza. So i went down their they. Tried giving me cold a** pizza. And tried saying i didnt pay wen i payed over the phone with my debit card.  They told me they couldnt find my adress they didnt evn call me to let me know what was goin on! And Im still waitin on my refund! Never agian will i deal with this ghetto pizzahut! Garbage!"}
{"text":"We called up this Pizza Hut tonight because we were a little hungry, curious about the new Pizolo, and had a $10 credit on our account for an issue during our last delivery experience (we had ordered a 2-liter Mountain Dew, the delivery dude did not deliver it, the dude went back to get it but ultimately never made it back the 2nd time). So tonight we called in our order for pickup and let them know we would be using our credit toward our purchase. We ordered 2 Pizolos, 1 medium cherry dessert pizza, andThe gentleman on the phone said we would be good to go in 20 minutes so we hung out and then headed over on our 12 mile round-trip adventure to the restaurant.

This location has a convenient drive-up window so we did not have to jump down and go inside. Upon pulling up to the window, we saw a sign posted that broke down how much they CHARGE for red peppers and grated parmesan. I was shocked: those items should totally be free with purchase!!! I was even more shocked that they were not even selling PREPACKAGED PACKETS of those items, but rather were selling little cups that they measure out from a huge bulk container! I found this to be very uncool... profitting from the sale of necessary pizza condiments! Whatever... we figured we had some in the fridge from last time and forewent the cheese and peppers. 

When we arrived home, we sat down and popped open our 3 boxes. The Pizolo's looked good, kind of like golden brown pizza-burritos. The wings looked tasty but they did not come with any kind of ranch or bleu cheese dressing; we were not advised of this situation, nor was dressing offered to us.  I am positive though that they would have charged us for it had we requested it, as they do with the cheese and peppers. Ok, so no biggie, we have our own ranch dressing in the fridge too. Then I opened up the dessert pizza box. To my dismay, it was 50% incomplete! It was just a crust covered in cherry pie filling, and it did not have any of the brown sugar crumble or icing. We pondered for a few minutes whether we should call them or not and ultimately decided to do so.

I called in and waited the line as it was busy with high call volume. A girl picked up and I told her what our dilemma was. She placed me on hold again and a man (the manager maybe??) picked up. I told him what was going on and he said, \"Oh I know.\" I was wicked confused... he sent us away with our pie knowing it was not up to par?!? He offered to credit our account and I reminded him that we had used a credit on our account to pay for this order. He told me I could drive 12 miles again (now looking at 1 and a half gallons of gas dealing with all this). I told him that they should be willing to delivery it to us, given the service issues we have received lately and he said \"OK well it will be about 45 minutes then.\" I told him that was fine and in the most sarcastic tone imaginable, he told me \"Thanks and God bless you.\" I will not further comment on that... I'll just say I was a little blown away.

After 55 minutes the dessert pizza arrived. It looked amazing, but I think the delivery dude was terrified to have to bring it here because he literally tossed it in to us and bolted. Poor kid.... this must happen a lot.

While the food was tasty, I don't have the patience for these service issues and I really don't appreciate the fact that I have to pay to enjoy condiments that are intended to enhance my dining experience. Going forward, we will take our pizza needs elsewhere."}
{"text":"Pizza arrived cold and soggy and they have poor customer service as well. I would not recommend this location."}
{"text":"I prefer Pizza Hut to other brands . Here in Tempe [where I moved to from Denver, Colo] there are MANY competing Pizza places in this ASU college city. 
I have tried them all, and most are quite tasty and affordable. However-this Pizza Hut offers the BEST deals and Best service on what I consider the BEST tasting Pizza in town!
 If you want to save some money and be totally satisfied, then ENJOY this Pizza Hut pizza! [PS.-I only review/post very exceptional or very poor]"}
{"text":"We had a craving for pizza and decided to pack up the family and head over to one of the last remaining Pizza Hut restaurants in the area. We were greeted by a friendly staff member and led to a table to sit down... but that's where the good points of this review end.

We waited at the table for a waitress to come by to say \"hi\".

5 minutes pass.

Wave to passing waitress - no response.

Another 5 minutes pass.

Wave to greeter who promptly said she will fetch our waitress.

Another 5 minutes pass.

Finally a waitress comes by - but to the table in front of us. We ask her to take our order and she says \"I'm not your waitress!\" What... after 15 minutes of waiting, not a word from our waitress?!

I went to the manager and asked where our waitress was ... but no one seemed to have an idea.

Needless to say we packed up and left hungry."}
{"text":"These losers messed up my pizza, probably because it's \"trendy\" to hate pineapple on pizza. Either that, or they are very incompetent with no ambitions but to work at Pizza Hut for the rest of their lives. It's apparent now that Pizza Hut doesn't care about their customers."}
{"text":"So back in September I ordered a medium pan pepperoni for carryout. When I got home, I found I had been given hand tossed crust instead. I promptly called and spoke with a manager who informed me my next medium pizza would be free.
I just called tonight to get my correct pizza and was told by the manager that because it was a new year and more than 90 days had passed, my credit was no longer available. Had this been explained to me on the original call, I would have redeemed my credit sooner. 
While I am out the original $10 I spent (hand tossed is disgusting and I did not eat it) this pizza hut is out 1 customer."}
{"text":"(Just a pregnant lady trying to satisfy a craving) 
*According to other reviews, this place is known for always messing orders up. Don't waste your money here* When I order from other PH locations, the pizza is usually thicker and somewhat fluffy. Both of the pizzas I ordered were thin and hard to pull apart. They also looked like they were left in the oven for too long. My first pizza tasted like it was drenched in garlic. Seriously, drenched. I tried the second one in hopes of not finding the same overwhelming garlic taste. Same thing. The crust was also super sticky. ? I'm usually not one to complain about messed up food orders, but this was truly VERY disappointing. Don't know how this place is still open after seeing everyone's reviews."}
{"text":"I've been a long time customer at this location but unfortunately today will be my last day. I placed an order online at 5:00 p.m. Order number 99 to be exact. I arrived at the location at 5:15. I was greeted with an attitude right off the bat by a young lady. I gave her my name and I paid for the food. Then I asked if the pizza was ready and she said the pizza wasn't ready. I asked for an ETA and she said \"I don't know.\" Okay, I sat down and I patiently waited. 30 minutes passed by and still nothing. I understand they were busy, so I waited. An hour went by and nothing. So I spoke with my manager to see what's the status of my order? The manager asked the staff if they knew where my order was and nobody had a clue. Seems like my order got lost? The manager said he'll get my order asap and he apologies. Another 30 minutes passed by. It's 6:38 now and I asked my manager if I can get my money back. Long story short, the staff needs work and I'm sorry, I waited as long as I could. This was my second problem that I had."}

{"text":"Very disappointed.  Placed phone order and was told 15 minutes.  Thought this was pretty fast for a Friday night Labor Day weekend but was glad to not have to wait long.  WRONG!  Got there on time an was told it would be another 8 minutes.  That 8 minutes turned into 40.  Finally cancelled my order.  They were so overwhelmed they were turning dine in customers away.  Not good business.  Was told by employees they had switched to a call center for phone orders and I should not have been told my order would only take 15 minutes.  Won't be back."}
{"text":"Furious at the \"service\" given at this Pizza Hut. I ordered a half black olive, half plain cheese pizza online and discovered upon arriving back home that the entire pizza was covered with olives. 
My companion cannot stand olives, so I called and was on hold for almost 3 minutes. Finally, an unpleasant employee answered the phone and I explained the situation. She immediately offered to deliver a new pizza - but once I gave the address (quite literally five minutes away), she informed me that they do not deliver to my address and would not be budged. My pizza would take at least half an hour before it could be picked up. 
In my precious food service job, I was taught to bend over backwards for customers who have been wronged. Pizza Hut failed miserably at doing so."}
{"text":"I would say 86 percent of the time they are too busy, and or mess up my order.  Back when the Hendricks brothers ran this joint it was A list, now it's just some pizza place that I used to know!!! Lower your prices or match the quality to price"}
{"text":"This address is closed for remodeling. 16th and Thomas are taking the orders and deliveries until they reopen.  I was informed by the 16th and Thomas location. So all is not lost Pizza Hut lovers. Expect to wait a little as they are smaller. Don't call at the last minute preplan the delay and everyone will be happy. Yummy!! Pizza!!"}
{"text":"Horrible food for an \"Italian Bistro\".
The menus were wet, our plates were full of water, our table was soaked. Our personal pan pizzas were soggy. The cashier has a headphone in. I would rather lose an arm than eat here again."}

{"text":"I can only speak to the pick up service & food.  We order here frequently and tonight's experience was no different than usual.  Excellent.

We placed an order online and I left to go pick it up.  It was ready and being boxed as I arrived.  Service at the desk as always was friendly and prompt even when they are multitasking.  Pizzas tasted great.   This location is everything I want from take out pizza."}
{"text":"Ordered pizza and chicken for delivery. Upon sitting down to eat, I noticed one of my pizzas had cheese on the top portion of the pizza and none on the bottom. So I called the store and the person I talked to started talking to the manager. I can hear the manager in the background talking about they all get one cup of cheese. So the guy gets back on the phone saying there is nothing they can do. I wish the pizza hut that is closer to me was still open. I've never had any problems with my main location. I will never order pizza from this place again."}
{"text":"This is for the buffet.

It amazes me that this place doesn't have higher marks.  I work near by and visit here once in a while w/ some co-workers.  Every time it's been good.

You're always greeted by a cute girl who seats you.  Makes you wish that the Hut wasn't all you were hittin'.  Tables are always clean, even with a packed house.  Buffet rules apply here as well.   \"No matter how fat you are, there is always someone fatter at the the pizza hut lunch buffet.\"

If you like salad, you'll love it here.  The veggies aren't the best of quality, or the freshest, but much better than a dumpster at the local jail house.  Plenty of choices of produce and fixin's make you feel like a king among men.

The pizza buffet is always well stocked and the pies keep flowin' in.  Remember, I go at noon, the place is packed.  Not usually an empty chair in the house.  It's hard to feed that many hungry folks so efficiently.  

The za tastes decent.  It's not going to win any awards, but you're in a Pizza Hut and the bill is $9.47.  Do you really think you're going to have flowers and glitter in your eyes as you chomp on that piece of Badger Special?

The staff is attentive.  Soda and water glasses are never empty and the food is adequate.  No wonder the place is always busier than a fire extinguisher at a Great White concert.  Keep up the good work!!!!"}

{"text":"Wonderful service. We ordered online and when I went in to pick up the pizza, the lady that checked me out was wonderful! She went through my order, checked and made sure everything was right and offered plates, napkins and peppers. Far better service than I have ever received at any other Pizza Hut. Kudos to y'all"}

{"text":"Currently still waiting for my food. It's over 30 minutes late and I ordered 1.5 hours ago."}
{"text":"Pizza is inconsistent. Sometimes under cooked, other times cut disturbingly wrong ( sad when half of it is for a vegetarian ). Forget ordering chicken wings! It's like pulling teeth!!!! How hard is it to get \" medium bone out \"? 4 out of 5 times it's anything but! Last night was the straw that broke camels back when we found out that this time they gave us honey BBQ. After calling the manager to let her know of the mistake, she replies \"I guess some one else got your wings\". Really!? An apology would have been more appreciated then a sarcastic comment! I don't recommend going to this Pizza Hut. The service is worse then the neighborhood it sits in. I wish there was a negative star I could rate this place."}
{"text":"I have only ordered delivery from this location. The pizza is great tasting, like any other pizza hut I've been to. My issues have been regarding my orders. More often than not they forget something in my order. Once it was a 2L bottle of pop, and quite a few times it's been my dipping sauce. I currently have a credit on my pizza hut account for free dipping sauce for the next time I order. I order here about twice a month and I can understand forgetting once or twice but it seems like it's every other time now. The food does arrive hot and on time though, which is a plus."}
{"text":"Placed an order at 10:02pm online. Received a call at 11:14pm stating that they are experiencing a 2 hour long delivery time and that they turned off the grill for the wings. if i wanted them it would be about another 30min wait, but that my pizza was ready now.  The person on the phone didn't offer much else information or alternatives. We had already prepaid and it was too late to order from anywhere else- asked if we could subsititute the wings for something else. We did. According to their website and yelp, they close at 11pm..if you're busy why would your ovens/grills be turned off? And why does it take over an hour to notify someone that you can't complete their order? Still sitting here 24 min later and still have not received my order. the pizza has been ready this whole time... Excited to bite in to this fresh pizza!!"}
{"text":"Awful customer service. Placed an order for a medium pizza at 6:15pm and was told pizza wouldn't arrive until 10:00 pm. The time before this our pizza arrived cold with the cheese as hard as a rock. If you like Pizza Hut order from a different location because this one will surely disappoint you!"}
{"text":"I'm not a big fan of pizza hut in general but overall a decent place. 

have gotten this location several times and the only downside is it can be a bit inconsistent (not majorly), sometimes light on cheese, sometimes too light on sauce etc. mostly it's made normal and relatively consistent. but i'v had time were I said to myself \"you know, this is actually really good!\" and others time where I say \"now I remember why i don't like pizza hut and prefer papa johns, dominoes etcetc\"

employees were always polite never had a problem.
If you like pizza hut I don't see any reason not to try this location."}
{"text":"I give them a three, but we have had service that ranges from 1-5 stars.  We always order extra cheese, and they charge a $2 fee for extra cheese.  We decided to order two pizzas once, one with extra cheese and one with regular.  They came the same.  They charge you for extra cheese, but you don't always get it.  We sometimes get pizza that is overcooked, on the border of being burnt.  When we call and conplain, they offer to replace the bad pizza.  It is kind of a hit or miss with this location.  Sometimes good, sometimes not so good."}
{"text":"I finally get my delivery 1hour and 20 minutes later! Of course it's cold.... and all I wanted was some pizza. This place clearly lacks in delivery and customer service. I'd give negative 10 stars"}
{"text":"We like eating pizza but what we got from this place was not pizza.  The pizza had a disgusting flavour and bread sticks weren't puffy and there wasn't any parmesan topping on them.  The employee was rude and thought she was the best thing to happen to pizza since pepperoni. 

I would not suggest eating at this restaurant of you're human.  My dog was ok with it but even he didn't feel right after."}
{"text":"Do not order from this place. I ordered online and it said my pizzas would be delivered in 25 min. It took almost an hour. Tried to call them and no one would answer the phone. Pizza was cold and tasted old. Not all of the cheese was melted. 
A frozen pizza is better than the crap I got."}
{"text":"If I could give this location zero stars I would! Worst service ever! I have ordered pizza for delivery twice from this store and never received it. When I called to ask about it, I was put on hold forever and then hung up on. Please hire some decent people who actually want to work and have customer service skills, instead of the rachet people you currently have working at your location."}

{"text":"Fuck this place!!! I live about 3 minutes away, my girlfriend and I were still drunk from the night before, didn't want to drive. So we ordered about 30 bucks worth of pizza and wings online.... seriously took an HOUR AND 45 minutes to get there... pizza was SUPER cold, and the dough on the pizza already started to loose air, so it was seriously nasty... I mean, we still ate it, Cuz we were drunk still kinda... but FUUUCCK them!!! Unless there is no other option in the WORLD, don't go there...!!!!"}
{"text":"I ordered the overstuffed Italian pizza for $12.99 by phone per the operators (sounds like a African American woman) suggestion that i order this special.  So i say\" Okay, sounds like a tasty pizza, i will have one\".  I completed my order and the operator said\" Okay, that will be out to you in one hour\".     

 At this point i am very hungry because i'm working a 16 hour shift and i'm not allowed to leave my post while on duty so i have to get my pizza delivered.

1 hour 20 minutes later i call them back and ask \"Where is my order? The operator (sounds Hispanic or White) answers\" I'm sorry sir, we cancelled the order due to the fact we no longer carry that type of pizza.\" \"We also tried to call the number you gave us to inform you of this.\"  I informed her that there were no missed calls on my desk phone and i was by that phone 90% of the time in the last 2 hours.

The operator offered me a discount if i reordered another pizza and i asked\" How long will it take to get it out to me?\"   The operator said\" 1 hour\".   I said\" No thank you\"   It was already late into my shift and i could just stay hungry till i got home.  If she would have said\" 30 minutes\" then i would have reordered another pizza.

I will not order from this location again. They have workers there that ring up pizza specials that they no longer offer. lol Advice to the Manager of this restaurant: Remove menu items that you no longer offer FROM THE CASH REGISTER COMPUTER.  Then you can avoid these types of problems."}
{"text":"I received 2 pizzas that I didn't order. I give them a call and talked to the manager. He agree to make two pizzas that we ordered and delivered to us with no cost.  Superb service!"}
{"text":"Generally like Pizza Hut but this location seemed understaffed. This of course made it take forever to get food. Called our two pizza order in more than 40 minutes before pickup... Still waiting

Looks like dominos pizza next time!"}
{"text":"What university town doesn't have a glut of pizza joints surrounding the campus? You would think all the competition would motivate each establishment to vie on quality, taste, price, service, convenience--something to differentiate itself from the place down the street.

Pizza Hut doesn't seem to care about standing out on any basis except bad customer service. We ordered 15 pizzas today for lunch before a lecture. Delivery time was set for 11:45 so people could get pizza before the noon lecture started and they could eat it while listening to the speaker. 

The lecture started on time but the pizza was late. The delivery boy finally showed up and brought 10 pizzas in one trip and said he had to make a second trip for the rest of the pizzas, plates and napkins. By the time things were set up, It was too late to interrupt the speaker and ask the audience of 40 to help themselves to pizza in an adjoining room. 

I told the delivery boy I was unhappy that he was late and that I would keep the pizzas but would not pay for the pizzas since they were going to sit around for an hour and get cold before people could eat them. I told him I would call his manager and discuss the situation with her. 

He said if I wasn't going to pay for pizza, then he would take them all back. He started to pack them up while complaining that I was messing up his scheudle. I relented, signed for the them, and went to call the manager. The manager heard my story but said I could either have the pizzas picked up or pay for them. They would not comp them even though they were delivered late and our guests missed a timely lunch.

The manager said she did not have the authority to comp $200 worth of pizza. She could just pick them up or I could pay for them. It dawned on me later that if Pizza Hut picked up the pizzas, by law they would have to throw them away, so they would be losing the money whether they were picked up or if they comped them. I asked, haven't you ever had a bad experience at a restaurant and had the manager come over, apologize for the screw up and comp the meal? She said she couldn't comment on that scenario.

The irony is that this order went bad at two different times. I called the store hours before delivery and told them I could meet them on the street with a cart so the driver wouldn't have to waste time finding a place to park or getting lost looking for our building. I was told that wasn't necessary. If we had done that, I would have been happy with the order and it would have been on time. 

Later, if the delivery driver had brought plates and napkins during his first drop off, people could have started eating, but I had to wait for his second trip for the plates and napkins and by then our lecture had started and it was too late for people to eat.

So Pizza Hut got their $200, but we didn't get timely delivery or hot pizza. It ended up sitting around for 1-1/2 hours. We won't be ordering anything from them in the future. On average, we order pizzas at least once a month--Big Jimmy's or Hungry Howies, stand by for our call. Just be on time."}
{"text":"Ordered online for lunch and it said the wait was one hour. I tried calling the store to see if that was right but nobody ever answered and was disconnected. I was curious to see if someone would call about my food sitting there but nothing happened."}
{"text":"DO NOT USE YOUR CREDIT CARD FOR A PURCHASE HERE!!!!! I made an online order here and the delivery driver wrote himself a tip on my receipt. It took me two weeks to try to get it handled through their corporate office just for a representative there named Ginger to tell me one of her co-workers said it looked like I wrote the tip in myself! Why would I write a tip in myself them have to deal with them to be disrespected and belittled?? I asked her why her coworker would say this and how in the world do you distinguish how someone writes letters in comparison to only a signature?? She said she didn't know and asked me to call the store to give them my card number so they could refund me the tip. WHAT?? Why would I call the store to give them my credit card information when they already forged a tip on my credit card receipt. Needless to say, this is a warning and hopefully you have a better customer experience than I did because this was one of my worst ones yet!!!!"}
{"text":"The place is big and nice. We went there for take-away so can't say much more. It was our first visit to Pizza Hut, pizza there tastes ok, but too greasy. They spray it with cooking oil after it's done. Well I wasn't looking for healthy choice at that time, but this was too much."}
{"text":"The worst service! Wait  on hold. 45min. Delivered 1mile away. Terrible   like sat on the stove for a day.  manager she was wroud never ever will i buy pizza hut again."}
{"text":"They shouldn't call the meaty marinara by that name. There is no meat and no marinara. If you like plain dry white spiral noodles with cheese burnt on top, then this is for you.
If you want some sauce in it then don't buy this. I see why I was the only person in this restaurant. The people don't care how they make the food and it's not worth paying for. No matter how little it costs."}

{"text":"Went here for dinner one night with my sig other.  only 2 families were there beside us.  We waited over an hour for our food, a latino family came in a few minutes after we had ordered.   They sat down ordered. got their food and left by the time our meal came.  Our waitress was a young latino woman.  Not sure if that had anything to do with it.  I told them they had forgot my cookie that I had already paid for and as I was signing the check and the girl behind the counter said she was sorry and verbatim \"do you still want the cookie?\" um, of course I do if I already paid for it!! so they put in in and I waited another 10 to 15 minutes for it.  while we were sitting in the booth waiting for our meal we noticed a lot of horsing around in the kitchen area and loud laughing from the staff.  It was like a bunch of teenagers just hanging around and not doing much of anything but joking and laughing.  Im extremely dissatisfied and will never go to this store again."}
{"text":"Absolutely Awful trash service. Take forever to get to your table. Had  to ask for our drinks ourselves since our waitress never asked us. They don't use note pads and our order was messed up three times. Three not just one. The Caesar salad didn't even have sauce. Waitress was also rude since we kept asking her to fix our orders since she screwed it up. first and last time dining here."}
{"text":"I went to pick up my pizza the total was $18 and some change they wouldn't take my $50 bill so I left and didn't come back. You don't take my cash, I don't take your food. I will never go to this location EVER! They are so rude anyway. In the middle of me placing my order they placed me on hold and never came back to the phone. I had to call back. This location sucks! Bad customer service!!"}
{"text":"I swear, I have never seen anything like this horrible service I received today.  I am ordering and she interrupts me with \"phone number\", \"name\".  Ok.  I ordered, she gave attitude, then left.  She didn't come out when people came in ten minutes later either.  I ordered one other thing after I flagged down a different guy since she would not come out. Oh, those other customers simply left. When she finally came out, there were more customers who she never even approached, simply waiting there.  Wow."}
{"text":"After a long day of errands, my fiancé and I wanted an easy meal so we ordered for delivery. The wait said an hour and eight minutes. An hour and a half later, I called and was told that my order had left not too long ago. Great...we live 5 minutes down the road so maybe it'll be here any minute now. Another twenty minutes later, the pizza, pasta, and breadsticks come and they were cold. Not just warm, but cold. We ended up having to heat the food up on the microwave. I was less than pleased with this experience."}
{"text":"Probably the worst Pizza Hut I ever encounter. I am big Pizza Hut fan too. Sad. Two hour delivery too when you call. Lol how is that even allowed? Smfh then they expect a tip. Gtfo"}
{"text":"First off let me state that normally this store has provided me with great service and product.  However, on 12/18/13 we ordered several of the pzones.  The delivery service was great, and the delivery from this store has always been great.  The pzones themselves were real good.  However, the marinara sauce that they gave for the pzones was the worst excuse for a dipping sauce I have ever experienced.  The sauce was so thinned out it was like water.  Dipping the pzones in that sauce was useless.  The dipping sauce just washed right off of the pzone.  So the lackluster dipping sauce just ruined the pzones all together.  


I don't know if this is the way their marinara sauce that comes with pzones is supposed to be like, but if it is I will never order the pzones from here again.  I'll just stick to their pizza or order from a different pizza place.

This was definitely not what I have grown to expect from a National chain like Pizza Hut.

Update

Pizza Hut contacted me and gave me a credit towards future purchase due to my experience."}

{"text":"do not order from this location

i ordered a large grilled cheese stuffed pizza , i was called ad told that they are out of grilled cheese ad they only have regular cheese. i was annoyed because i wanted to try the new   product  but it was fine it happens . but this just the beginning the pizza was oily and soggy [check pictures ] . the previous time i ordered from this location the send me a pizza with the wrong toppings . this is a poorly manged location . what a waste of my money ."}
{"text":"I just read many of the reviews and will say I have always had a different experience here. I order online 100% of the time and get a 15-20 minute ready time. I also always pick it up myself, which seems to be other yelpers main complaint. I have never had to wait more than 5 minutes after arrival and that is usually just because of other customers in front of me. 

My pizzas have always been hot and taste like the Pizza Hut pizzas I have enjoyed for many years in Las Vegas. 

I guess a suggestion for other customers would be to order online and pick it up yourself. It seems the delivery service and quality control for delivery is this location's downfall. The pizzas taste better from Pizza Hut than most other pizza restaurants and I would bet the ratings here would improve if delivery service could be managed better."}
{"text":"Food is ok but Horrible delivery service. They called on the wrong number despite we have given the right one. Hence didn't deliver the food and when we called to ask if you can't we can pick up the food they said we are closed and you can't do carry out as well. Horrible horrible service."}
{"text":"Waited 2 hours for an order only to receive it partially cooked and soggy. Upon calling the store the manager offered them credit and told us the store was closed then hung up on us. When we called back the manager refused to speak to us and had his subordinate tell us the phones weren't working and to call back tomorrow. They then disconnected again. When we called back they had switched the phones off. 

0/10 Garbage. Will not try again."}
{"text":"Ordered a pizza for carry out since my room mate does this at least twice a week, I'm not a big Pizza Hut fan but thought it sounded good on this rare occasion. Online it said it'd only take 15 minutes. Cool. Get there right on time and the computer screen says I'm ready. Guy calls out name of girl in front of me, she pays, calls out my name, I go to pay but there's a problem with my card so the guy says he needs a manager. Manager comes out, not a problem very friendly very helpful very quick. Tells me after that the previous cashier will get our pizza out and sorry for the issue with my card. Problem is that cashier wandered to the back and never came back. I think he believed the manager would give us our pizza which is sitting in a pizza warmer in the front but he DID NOT. Little confused we sit and wait 12 minutes til the manager comes back and gives us our pizza looking confused as well. The place was cool until the cashiers miscommunication made me wait a little longer than expected. I'm pretty patient. But what made me knock a star off is that either the cashier or manager left the pizza warmer wide open that whole 12 minutes we waited so my pizza wasn't too hot when it was finally handed to me. Sad face."}
{"text":"OK.. So we had pizza last night. We did the $10 for any kind or type of pizza. So I ordered a stuff crust meatlover, pan crust supreme, and pan crust pepperoni lovers. Along with that, I got a double order of chicken alfredo pasta, buffalo medium bone in wings, buffalo medium bone out wings, double order of cheesey bread, and got a free order of breaksticks; just for getting the chicken pasta! It came out to rounding off $70. It was all worth it, cause them fambam ate all of it. The lady that took my order was kind enough to carry the pizzas to my car even though I said that I could carry them. WE LOVE SOME PIZZA. We get pizza at least once a week."}
{"text":"Might be one of the dingiest Pizza Huts I've ever been to. Table was dirty, place is out of date. Restaurant was freezing. Though it lists beer on the menu they don't sell any. Waiter said you can byob. Seems it functions mostly as a pick up or carry out."}
{"text":"Been here twice and had the same cashier guy both times; friendly and no attitude.  I showed up about 25 minutes before they closed; and I know restaurant workers hate that, but I needed my pizza fix.  The cashier was friendly and actually made me feel at ease going to pick up my pizza this late on a Saturday night.  Can't go wrong with Pizza Hut.  I like how online, you could choose to flavor the crust versus how it was in the past where they would automatically flavor it making it oily and more salty.  I will be going back to this particular one often as it is near where I live and everything is easy going inside when I visit."}
{"text":"I have tried several times, with out any success, to order online and I have never been successful in making that order. I would like to try the stuff crust pizza that they have as an special here during Thanksgiving. I called the phone and I get advertisement after advertisement after effort this week and that is just so irritating as is trying to get an order through on the stupid computer oh you get all the specials if you order online but you can't get through online I'm very very discouraged with this whole situation.  Nothing like having the desire for something and not being Able to reach out and get it as easily as they say you can. I'm very disappointed."}
{"text":"I wish I could give a better rating, and I would if I had received better food. I'm sorry Pizza Hut, but the bad is on you!  One star for the friendly driver and the hot \"food.\"  Yes, their new bags do work well, but what they keep hot is definitely not worth the warmth!!  First of all, the pizza. I love pizza !! Real pizza; you know, the kind that tastes like PIZZA. I ordered a stuffed crust pizza with mushrooms and green peppers. I can't believe how scantily clad my pizza was with toppings. And the sauce?  What sauce!!  Missing sauce is more like it!!  The crust tasted like it was made out of my report I wrote in 6th grade about \"Ethics.\"  It was about 8 pages long and was hand-written (no computers in those days).  It was absolutely by far the worst \"pizza\" I have ever had!!  It should've stayed hidden under the hut!!  The boneless chicken  wings I got for my three dogs were awful!!  If they were dog food they would've been recalled!! I tasted them and felt guilty for wanting to feed them such nasty  grub.  I shared the pizza crust with them and boy did they have horrible gas the next day!!
My question is:  Where are the owners?  Or, where are the managers?  To allow such shoddy products to leave their business is a reflection on them!!!!"}
{"text":"My husband prefers Pizza Hut to most other big pizza delivery chains and I do like their chicken.  This is the only reason we gave this location a second chance after they botched our order a few months ago.  

The first order was easy: one pizza and a few orders of wings.  Delivery took close to three hours. We called the franchise several times and were told each time that our food was \"on the way.\"  I've googled the distance between this location and our home.  According to Google, it takes 13 minutes to get from their door to ours in normal traffic.  Add cook time, other deliveries, and a courtesy period for (imaginary) traffic and it still shouldn't take 3 hours.  I could have driven to Raleigh, ordered pizza there, and received it faster.  The delivery guy stated that he was their only person doing deliveries that day, so I was willing to give him the benefit of the doubt and assume this was a fluke.  Additionally, the manager did credit us with $20 towards our next order, though.  While nobody was rude during this encounter, nobody seemed overly concerned with the shotty customer experience.  Apathy, now a functioning business practice.

Yesterday, we gave this Pizza Hut another shot.  We placed an online order: 2 medium pizzas with only pepperoni and 1 order of wings.  We received the order confirmation via email and 45mins later a phone call from a NY area-coded cell phone stating that our credit card was declined and then the call dropped.  So at this point, we don't know who the phone number belongs to or if someone is trying to rip us off.  An hour and a half in, I called the store and was told by the employee that our order status was fine and that the pizza had already been sent out.  No apology for the delay or the explanation for the cell phone call.  At the two hour still-no-food mark, we received another call from the bad-reception NY cell phone.  It's the manager. He apologized for the bad reception, which was because he was under the Viaduct (the only Viaduct I know close to Charlotte is in the mtns). He stated our credit card was declined, but that it was sent out as a cash order.  I asked why they'd send an order out that was declined, what if I didn't have cash, and why the store didn't ask for another credit card when I called... no answer to either question.  The manager, I'm pretty sure Drew, said our order would be free and to just tell the delivery guy when he arrived.  To recap: the BUSINESS solution was for the us to tell the delivery guy that his manager said we didn't have to pay; we quickly placed an order with HH Gregg for a new TV based on this gem - \"No no, it's cool, bring our new curved OLED right in. I know you haven't received payment yet, but your manager said it was cool.\"  Again, when the pizza came, it was cold. And again, the delivery guy stated he was the ONLY person who was doing deliveries as they were again short-staffed.  It begs the question: why was the manager hiking at the Viaduct when he probably could have been helping his staff meet delivery obligations?

Stoners of the world, rejoice, because here's your ticket to free food:  Step 1 Order 2.5 - 3 hours before you actually want to eat, Step 2 An hour into your wait, call asking where your food is (you'll be told that order has already been sent out), Step 3 Wait another hour and get baked, Step 4 Call again (because there is no chance in hell you would have received your food by now) and express your sincere displeasure at which point they will half-heartedly apologize and comp your order, Step 5 You food will arrive, tip or don't tip, that's on you, but just know the I'm-The-Only-Driver schtick has been in place for 3-4 months already, Step 6 reheat and eat your food.  On second thought, six steps might be too many for stoners. 

Will we order again? No."}
{"text":"I don't want to blame this location, or maybe it's just because I haven't eaten Pizza Hut in many years prior to coming here. I just suspect Pizza Hut in general has gotten bad. It doesn't taste like the pizza I had in my youth which was pricier than other chains, but tasted better quality than those cheaper pizza places. Still a bit pricier, but the quality, as well as flavor, have taken a dive. Nice location; looks clean; convenient; open late; decent service. They don't carry personal pizzas which is a major bummer. And even if the pizza sucks the breadsticks still taste the same. The other sides are tasty as well, but the name isn't \"Pasta Hut.\""}
{"text":"I ordered online for carry out. When I pulled up I could see they were busy, about 5 people waiting already. I waited a few and two people exited with their order. I entered but wasn't greeted. There were two guys on the bench, ronda rousey type on my right and older woman on my left. After five minutes of the loud chatter between the guys on whether someone played football or basketball in college, another group enters. A small greeting finally from the back I will be right with you. I made the comment loud enough to be heard back there \" okay but you running out of room up here.\"  a few moments and a cashier arrives, but has no clue who was here first. I gave the direction of who was here before me and that mine was ready. The ronda rousey was kind and let me get my boxes and go. The couple that came in behind me decided on chicken next door rather then wait for pizza. 
They either need hire more to keep someone up front at all times or install cameras so you can see how many people are stacking up in your little waiting room. I am sure the 7 adults and 1 kid violated some fire code for the space."}
{"text":"The first thing I saw when I sat down was that the table was not clean the bench was also dirty had to wipe the crumbs over to the other side of the table. So the waitress sat me at a dirty booth plus the bench seat had lack of padding hope you like sitting on wood. My silverware was dirty along with my glass.  When I was done eating then the waitress decided to see if I wanted a refill when I was getting ready to leave, needless to say no tip for lack of no service from her, then I kept seeing her go into the restroom I wonder if she washed her hands . My question is where are the managers to make sure that those tables are kept clean and wipe down who wants to sit at a table and see dirt. Not me. I will not eat there again."}
{"text":"I gave them one star! I called them twice and both times they picked up and hung up. I can hear them on the other end, I guess they don't care to get customers. SMH."}
{"text":"Probably the worst Pizza Hut in the history of Pizza Hut's. We have ordered from them 3 times in the last 2 months (hoping that it was just a fluke the first couple of times) but they cannot handle any order for delivery. The first time we ordered the stuffed crust pizza with garlic crust and with extra marinara- it took an hour for the pizza to get to is and low and behold, there is no garlic on the crust and only one marinara. Now, they did credit my account for the next time I ordered- how convenient that I have to order with them a second time to receive said credit. The second time we ordered since we had the credit, was the same order except we added on a 2 liter of Pepsi. Again, it an hour to get to us, shockingly the pizza was correct and we had our sauces, but of course, no soda. The delivery girl said she could go back and get it but that she had other deliveries she had to make first... An HOUR later she came back and handed me a warm 2 liter of Pepsi. By that time we had finished our food and the warm soda was useless. No apologies from the delivery girl or anything. Finally, last night, we decided to give them ONE more chance- we ordered their newest special with and asked for the garlic crust. Wouldn't you guess it? The pizza was wrong and there was no garlic on the crust. I didn't even call this time to tell them the order was wrong since their solutions to the problems are giving me money to ride NEXT time or bringing me something I ordered and paid for an hour after the fact. We will not be ordering for them again, and everyone we know also knows how horrible this place is and will not be giving business to them either. The way it's run and the attitudes/problem solving skills of the employees and management are abysmal. The ONLY reason I rating them one star is because I was forced to- because this place deserves NONE."}
{"text":"Awful customer service  and  unprofessional staff I would not recommend this place at all my order was 1 hour15 mins late and when I call to inquire my call was handled my three people they all gave me different answers moreover they didn't know where my order was the last girl I spoke with was very impolite and disrespectful !!!!"}

We ordered take-out from them on several occasions and the customer service and personnel are very pleasant and go out of their way to help you.  We ordered 7 pizzas the first time we tried them and everything was excellent.  We then ordered 15 pizzas and again, everything was great.  The pizzas were all excellent again.  We are very pleased with everything and we will continue to use their restaurant.  Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Called in 4 two topping pizzas for pickup. Asked for parmesan cheese and peppers which cook was reaching for them from under counter when cashier Hannah pushed her hand away and informed me that they were out of both. A little weird to me.

When I received the order it was minus the 24 boneless wings. The order looked complete when the order was submitted, but was a not. I was not charged for the 24 wings, but it was very disappointed that I had to reorder the wings AGAIN!

If you make an order via the mobile app or just the internet, look over your order item by item."}
{"text":"Great Pizza, friendly staff.  Tried the new mini hotdog pizza, complete with mustard.   Really a good combination.  Enjoy"}
{"text":"I would give this store zero stars if I could. I tired to order online using their $7.99 large two topping online only pizza deal. I chose to order a stuffed crust pizza so it added $2 to my order and my total came out to $9.99. When I went to checkout it said that I couldn't order for delivery because the minimum is $10 and I was a penny short. 

I called the store and at first they said I couldn't order a speciality like stuffed crust and I had to do either pan or hand tossed. That made no sense because my order total would have been even cheaper but I tried anyways and guess what? Same error saying I needed a $10 minimum. Then the person I was speaking to, Agusto, said it was their policy that it had to be $10 for delivery. 

I asked to speak to the assistant manager, Nicole, and she told me the same thing that it was their policy. I asked her why that special was even available online if I couldn't use it and she just kept saying that it was their policy that it had to be $10. I told her if they could deliver I would give her the extra penny to make it $10 but she refused, said I had to order more food, and then hung up on me. She was extremely rude and unprofessional and I sincerely hope she gets reprimanded by the store manager. The funny thing is that this same thing happened once in the past and when I called they promptly said they would deliver and then add the extra penny. Apparently in the last two weeks their policy changes??? They have just lost a loyal customer all for a penny. How sad."}
{"text":"Staff was very nice. Complimented my uni brow and my family. Treat us with respect. He didn't discriminate against us even though we walked in with immodest clothes. He took our order and was very thorough he even helped us correct the order when they forgot the sauce drizzle. He wasn't upset that we had added so much to our order and even got us a cheaper deal. Paul u a real one."}

{"text":"Ages ago, this Pizza Hut takeout location used to be a dine-in restaurant across the parking lot (which is now a Japanese restaurant). I don't think it was ever really busy enough to require so much seating, so they moved into a smaller place for just takeout and delivery. We've tried all the pizza chains, and for some reason we prefer this one. Personally, I think they're all pretty similar, but Pizza Hut does offer some good variety and some good deals and customization possibilities if you use their website. One of the best pizzas I ever had from a chain was when I ordered something through their website. That was a 4-star pizza. 
Tonight I ordered the Health Check Margherita Pizza and the Health Check Chicken Arrabiata. (Note to self: \"arrabiata\" must mean \"spicy\" because it was covered in crushed chili peppers. Should have gone with the chicken rustico instead.) The Margherita pizza was on a thin multigrain crust, and it's supposed to have less mozzarella cheese, but it seemed to have a ton, which made for a greasy and soggy, but great tasting pizza. The best part of the pizza was the tomatoes covered in garlic pesto. Which is why I went with the arrabiata, I thought the pesto would be great too, but it was drowned out by the chili peppers. 
The service is quick, the lineups are short, the food is often good, and it's close by. We haven't tried the  WingStreet wings, but there was a $15 pizza and wings special that we might try next time."}
{"text":"The first night we order pizza it took them about 40 minutes to deliver which I didn't mind. They called me saying they need to meet somewhere because the roads were blocked off. The driver ended up find a way to the apartment. (Jefferson sometimes blocks off roads because of the baseball games.) I really didn't mind the delay. I received a coupon from pizza hut the next day for two free one topping pizzas. The email said \"because we were late with your pizza we want to give you two free ones\" I thought this was really cool. So I called the store asking if I could use the coupon code if I call in and the manager said \"We can't process that, you need to do it online\" I said okay so, I did it online and it still charge me 16 dollars. I called again and a girl answered with a very rude adittude. Than after interrupting for the third time she hands me to the manager. Not a \"Hello how can I help you\" or \"HI what's going on\" instead the first thing I was told was \"I told you I can't help you with the online coupon.\" If a manager has an adittude with customers I don't want to imagine what the company managers act like. I simply wanted him to cancel the order so I could try to use the coupon again for the free two pizzas. All I wanted to ask was have him to cancel the order he says is \"OH, okay\" This pizza hut put such a bad mood that I didn't even want to use the coupon for this store anymore. We ended up getting Chick Fil A for the night and didn't get an adittude on side like pizza hut."}
{"text":"Terrible terrible service !!!  ghetto and beyond ratchet. Hair was in my pizza and they weren't apologetic at all more so rude than anything. Two mangers on shift and only one which was Aaron was nice enough to help me. Never again !!"}
{"text":"This is by far the BEST PIZZA HUT around.From the great HOT food to the AWESOME customer service. Our server Danielle went above and beyond what a server does. Checking back with us to keeping our drinks filled. The manager Mark that was running the store has this place running the way a pizza hut should be. He shouldnt be here.he should be sent to every pizza hut to fix them. Dont pass this location up. You will love it."}
{"text":"Too many problems with orders.  A few times the food that we received via delivery was not edible.  Bad taste a couple of times."}
{"text":"My experience here was so off the wall that I can barely believe it happened myself. Let's start at the beginning:
   A friend of mine had some people over and called in to order two large pizzas. The call was answered as one would expect, a greeting followed by the weeks specials. However, when my friend asked to place his order he's was told that he \"sounded like a demon.\" Then another person got on the phone and demanded that he come down and \"get f*#@cked in the @sshole.\" It was at this point that he hung up the phone.
    In disbelief we headed down to speak with the manager. When we entered we could see somebody in the kitchen working an oven with a bag over their head. Nobody was manning the register. Eventually we got to Melissa the manager. We explained what happened to her. Rather than show any kind of empathy, she defended what happened, telling us that they'd gotten a lot of prank calls that night. She also admitted to being the one to call my friend a demon. By her own admission, she then passed the phone off to a 17 year old who slew some of the more nasty dialogue. He eventually came out and stated that, \"he did not care if he got fired because he was about to work at a dealership and make more money than all of us.\"
    We requested that we speak to somebody a notch higher than melissa. She told us that she would contact Tabitha, who is the manager over 3 different locations. While we were waiting for her to get tabitha on site a man came from the back of the kitchen and started yellinng at us. We decided that this was a good time to go. While walking out the door he rushed at my friend, yelling that \"he was 28 years old\" and acting very aggressive. 
     This is where things become nearly unbelievable. He started shoving me, trying to initiate a fight. After he assaulted me melissa quickly pulled him back in to the kitchen. She yelled at him, \"if you go back out there I will fire you on the spot.\" He did not come back out. At this point they all went back into the kitchen and did not return. 
   The only person we spoke to after this point was a young man named Amon who apologized for the whole thing. He seemed to be the only half sane person in the building. 
    After about ten minutes of waiting there with Amon we eventually left, realizing that nobody was going to come back out. 
    I'm contacting my lawyer and will be petitioning for the security footage in order to pursue an assault charge on the person who came from the back of the kitchen. Please stayy away from this place"}
{"text":"Got transferred store to store multiple times trying to track down my hour late order that never came, eventually they just gave up and I got hung up on. Go somewhere else for pizza."}
{"text":"TERRIBLE!  I remember why I DON'T ever order from these cheap pizza places.  I thought I'd give this place one chance, ordered a thin crust sausage and BBQ chicken.  Delivery time was average for a Friday evening. Pizza was warm (not hot), it was over cooked and very dried out. I guess the proverb, \"you get what you pay for\" applies to this place.   I will never order from these terrible fast food places and can't recommend them for anything."}
{"text":"Was by far the worst pizza I have ever eaten in my life, no wonder there is a promo for $10 pizza each day of the week going on currently! I honestly should have stuck with dominos and pizza nova, thanks for reminding me to avoid pizza hut like the plague that it is. Lack of cheese, undercooked and lack of any toppings, this erin mills location of pizza hut is terrible.

Pizza Hut has gone way down in quality since Yum Brands took over. How about you guys enforce your franchisees to use fresh ingredients and not skimp on toppings/cheese. I will never return to pizza hut and this reminded me why I have not gone there in 2 years. 

I hope the CEO: Greg Creed, Executive Chair: David C. Novak, AND CFO Patrick J. Grismer of Yum Brands, choke on a piece of stale crusty ass pizza from the erin mills location, there is a special place in Hell where they serve pizza from store# R32816 erin mills."}
{"text":"The pizza on the buffet line is good, but not  always stocked up.  Too much wait time for replenishing.  The area dedicated for the buffet area is too small to service their customers.  They could improve their buffet by adding a salad bar."}
{"text":"The soda carrier broke and spilled my 20oz's all over. The Pizza box had grease coming out the side and ruined a pair of pants and the pizza was not cut through and had to get knife and re cut it. Had to put brownie in toaster oven to finish heating it up."}
{"text":"My wife ate here a few hours ago. She now has the WORST case of food poisoning. We will never eat here again!"}
{"text":"Ordered online, received confirmation that my order was placed, and had an estimated delivery time of an hour and a half. Almost the full hour and a half later (after 9 pm) someone named Matt called to inform me that my order had been cancelled because my home was out of the delivery range. After asking why no one had notified me earlier - when I had originally ordered the pizza - Matt gave no explanation for why it took so long to inform me, offered no apology or resolution to the problem. 

It is unacceptable that an order can be placed and confirmed only to find out at the end of the delivery time that it was cancelled. Will never order from here again."}
{"text":"I ordered my pizza and my pizza was 30 minutes late and we live 2 MINUTES AWAY! The fat delivery dude had a attitude when he came to the door when THEY WERE THE ONES THAT WAS LATE. He asked \"do you even want the pizza\" being a smart ass like we're wrong for being upset that our pizza was 30 minutes and and it was COLD. $21 dollars down the drain. We tried to call \"Gina\" MULTIPLE times and someone picked up and hung up on us. TERRIBLE customer service. I WOULD NOT recommend eating here period. They're unprofessional and their deliver boy is a disrespectful piece of shit. And if you work at this Pizza Hut and reading this fucc you and eat a dicc"}
{"text":"Where would I be without my Pizza Hut app?
I love there pizza as they have the best selection in fresh ingredients and they know how to pill them on!

Lets not forget about there pasta. 
That meaty one is the bomb!!!"}
{"text":"They get my food to me hot, fresh and generally quicker then the the amount of time they say it will take online.
The other day, the driver actually asked me how my service was and how long it took to get to me. That was odd as I have never had a driver seem like they give a crap about there own service before.
Thx guys and gals..."}
{"text":"Regular customer since they opened, until now.  Awkward phone conversation with manager revealed lack of customer service skills and exposes a generation of people who expect tips for doing nothing more than what they are already being paid to do."}
{"text":"I ordered two pizzas and wings tonight at 10:30pm. They called me after I placed my order online and let me know that they wouldn't be able to deliver because of car troubles but that they would comp $5 for my next order and that I could pick my order up at the store if I wanted. I chose to do that and asked how long it would take. They said it would take 50 minutes for my order to be ready. I head over at 11:30 only to be met by a closed door. I called the store and the woman at the register picked up and told me that they called all of the people who had orders in to pick them up by 11:15pm. I received no such call. I don't even honk that they put my order in. I've given them my business for the past year but now I will never order from any Pizza Hut, especially this disgrace of a \"restaurant.\""}
{"text":"I went when it was really busy, so my bad there. But other than that, the pizza was really good and everybody there was working hard. It loses a star because it was so crowded and not enough people were there to help the customers."}
{"text":"I ordered delivery and waited 90 minutes when I decided to call and check the status of my order.

They had not even started making the pizza yet and let me know if I wanted them to start it could be another 30-35 minutes.  2 hours for pizza? No thank you.

I never ended up receiving my pizza.  I do not recommend ordering from this location"}
{"text":"Let this be a warning::: Every time we order from Pizza Hut on Warm springs it is always late, cold, and no flavor!! I didnt realize that Pizza hut could possibly taste so terrible! I do not suggest ordering pizza from this location as the delivery drivers will show up with cold and disgusting pizza. Customer service is terrible and they are beyond rude to deal with over the phone. The Corporate Manager did give us a couple of free pizza coupons and suggested we go to a different location? That was last year. We started ordering the pizza again and delivery service is even worse , Pizza takes over 80 min to deliver! What ?  This place has lost my business. Save yourself the grief and call Dominos. Thank you"}
{"text":"Ridiculously slow delivery, it is almost 2 hours after my estimated delivery time and still no sign of them. I get it is Saturday night and all but my order was not large. Why? I literally ordered 3.5 hours ago and no pizza. I even called the store and they basically just explained they're busy and had no idea when my stuff would get here. Just the worst."}
{"text":"Customer service here is great. And issues with orders are always resolved in a good manner. Pizza tastes the same at any Pizza Hut location"}
{"text":"I debated wether 1 or 2 stars but the food was actually really good so I have to give em a extra for that, the problem was we ordered pizza and wings and drinks spent about $50 bucks. When they brought the wings out there was no sauce so I asked for ranch, the employee said we had to pay for each ranch I asked if I can't just have 1 ranch since we just spent all that money on food she said no and charged me 50 cents a side for ranch. I've never been to a place ever that Didn't at least give a couple sides of sauces for wings or a place that wouldn't have just gave me a side of ranch for free"}
{"text":"I think Pizza Hut has great flavor for the wings.. only problem is that the traditional wings have no meat. Other then that it's always been a good experience ordering from them."}
{"text":"Thank you.  My wife and I went to this Pizza Hut for our first date 39 years ago.  I went it last week to ask if I could reserve the table we sat at,  They not only reserved the table, they set it with flowers and real cloth placemats.  They also put our names on the sign out front.

Thanks to Pizza Hut for going the extra mile for two customers from the old school."}
{"text":"Ordered pizza and it was cold and a huge blob. They shifted it around so much it was almost inedible."}

{"text":"Going to start with the \"manager's\" name MONICA... so i get that i called on a tuesday night at  10:40ish PM and they close at 11PM which I thought they closed at 12AM .....BUT anyway she asks if its for delivery or pick-up so I  say delivery and she goes on to say it'll be a 50min delivery, I heard 15 so I ask if she said 15 and she goes \"fifTY\" with a very annoyed tone so i proceed to tell her she doesn't have to be rude about it.. she stays quiet and asks so delivery? 


so it ended being the wrong pizza hut for my zone and i went on to say Thank you but before i could even say that she had already hung up on me.. called back to ask for a manager to let them know how unpleasant she had been but of course she happened to be the manager soon I'll just tell it to yelp instead lol. Thanks for shitty service, Monica :)"}
{"text":"This is the first time I ordered a pizza from this place and when they delivered it was all smashed.
I call the place to let them know and they not even bother to apologize about the incident.
really bad experience from this place"}
{"text":"WORST PIZZA HUT EVER!!! Will never order from here again, last night was the final straw. Over the course of almost 3 years, this place has gotten worse and worse. We have gotten more account credits than I can count from crappy delivery experiences. Pizza is cold, orders are wrong and take HOURS longer than supposed to. Can take up to 2 and a half hours to receive pizza (that is COLD) and the store is less than a mile from me. Always have to reheat it in the oven. The only reason we ordered from here last night was to use up a credit we had but now NEVER AGAIN! Rude manager who argues with you, employees are total morons who can't even speak an audible or logical sentence over the phone. My toddler could answer the phone better. DOMINOS FROM NOW ON!! Wish this thing allowed to give ZERO stars!!!"}
{"text":"Today I ordered a pepperoni lovers pizza with banana peppers and there were hardly any toppings on my pizza my coworker ordered a pepperoni lovers pizza and it looked like a plain and pepperoni pizza barely any toppings whatsoever I like to think that I when I purchase something that it is quality I do not appreciate it at all you can do better Pizza Hut,"}
{"text":"This Pizza Hut is fast and efficient. I've never had a problem with their service or their pizza missing anything. The place always seems immaculate. The pizza, while not the bet on the planet, still satisfies my cravings for pizza and isn't so bad."}
{"text":"First of all, ordering ahead of time is a waste. I had to wait  They blamed it on the fact that five other people ordered stuffed crust at the same time I did. Then, when I got home, I realized they forgot the chicken. Worse yet, the pizza wasn't fully cooked and was floppy when I picked it up to eat. I wanted my money back and was happy to return the pizza. The manager said I didn't have to and that I would be reimbursed in about two weeks, which sucks. They apparently send it to you. The people there were very unprofessional. They people in the back cooking were cursing and it was easy to hear them in the front. When I called to ask for the manager, the stupid cashier, who was lazy and complained about being so tired to customers when I was there, screamed the manager's name in the phone. After several weeks, these people did not refund me for their raw pizza. The manager lied & took my info. for nothing."}
{"text":"Well my wife and I tried the Pizza Hut down Mcknight which was a disaster. Thinking that the one in Wexford might have better service and food, we went a bit out of our way to get carry out here. 

Granted it was peak time on a Friday, the service was terrible. It was impossible to get them on the phone and once I got there, I found out why. Easily 8 people were waiting for their carry out orders. One lady had been standing there for an hour. No one was answering the phones. I watched two people cancel their orders. Only after threatening to cancel mine after waiting 30 minutes did I receive it. Staffing was a clear issue here. The food was good and definitely better than the Pizza Hut down the road but the slow service left a bitter taste in my mouth. With all the other pizza options in the region, I have no plans to return to any of the PH locations in the area."}
{"text":"I would like to order but when I call the number it's not working. I think they are out of business at the E. Shea and 51 location"}
{"text":"Ok so I know that pizza hut doeant have the best pizza in the world but it should at least be hot right??? This is now the second time that we have ordered a pizza from this location and nos is the second time that I received a severely cold pizza when it arrived at my door and we only live ten min away at most from the stores location. The first time this happened we called and got a credit and figured everything would be ok the next time. Well we were wrong again today it happened and when we called to tell them the guy who answered the phone blamed it on the football game. (We ordered an hour before the game because of that reason) then he said I could have another credit or I could come pick it up. I shouldn't have to pick up a pizza it should be delivered hot and fresh. It wasn't hot or fresh it was cold and it was 20 minutes late. If you want to test your luck with this store good luck to ya."}
{"text":"This is 2nd time we order pizza . This time we went to pick it up . We didn't check  it because we were trusting of this place.  We get home and our pizza is  warm like it has been sitting  there .  We asked for a  pan pizza crust , we got thin crust . 
Horrible experience  it might be because of all this little kids working there and they don't give a crap  about customers  .  I guess you need to call screaming complaining in order to get good service and pizza 
Even better manager should be fired for hiring such incompetent  people .  Wish there was a 1/2  star 
No wonder they don't have such bad rating . 
This is last time here."}
{"text":"This is by far the worse place to order from. I ordered last night my order didn't get to me until two hrs later. then the driver asks me for 50$ so she could goto the store and break the change after I asked to make sure they had change for a fifty and they said yes they would.very shady in all honesty this Pizza Hut location should just close up and give it up they don't know how to run a successful business never ordering from them again"}
{"text":"I would rate this ZERO, BUT DO NOT HAVE THAT CHOICE!  I had family here for an impromptu dinner and thought I would order pizza and wings for a quick, easy dinner...well it was a disaster.  I chose to order from Pizza Hut.  Well, first of all, they told me 30 minutes.  I called an hour later and they said \"he's on his way...just minutes\".  The delivery person arrived, I gave him a $3 tip on a $20 order...waaaaay too much.  I opened the pizza box to find a burned, dried out pizza that was absolutely HORRIBLE!   It was burned, cold, and dried out.  I was so embarrassed that I ordered this for family from Madison that is used to GOOD pizza.   I called to tell them about my disappointment  about the horrible product they delivered. I called back after it was delivered to tell them about my disappointment and was asked to \"please hold\".  I did not hold and after I expressed my disappointment/concern about the horrible product and service, the person hung up!  That's what I call GREAT CUSTOMER SERVICE.  This is why eateries do NOT survive in mt. Horeb...they do not care about quality or customer service.  Good  Pubs/eateries in Mt. Horeb don't make it here...go else where - New Glarus, Verona, Madison, Spring Green...somewhere they SERVE THE PEOPLE that keep them in business. Obviously the food business in Mt. Hireb doesn't care if they stay in business...they will declare bankruptcy...the easy way out.  PIZZA HUT GO OUT OF BUSINESS...YOU SUCK.  Will NEVER ORDER FROM THERE AGAIN.  CANNOT BELIEVE HOW BAD IT WAS.  THE FOOD IS HORRIBLE!!!!  I cannot stress this enough."}
{"text":"I ordered online today and 25 minutes after it was supposed to arrive I called. I was put on hold for five minutes then hung up on. I called back and asked to speak to the manager and she was the rudest lady ever. She kept saying what do you want me to do there was an accident which caused the hold up. Then she said I'll just cancel your order. I got off the phone and 40 minutes later the delivery driver shows up. I told him our order was canceled and he apologized and told us that their regular driver did not show up to work today. So not only was the manager ignorant not even apologizing or offering to help fix the situation in any way she also lied to me! I will never use this Pizza Hut ever again!"}
{"text":"horrible. ordered online. big dinner box. now 21.99 offered brownie for 5.00 added it to the order. when you check out and place the order the price doesnt change. you cant add any coupons since its already on \"special\" so i went to pick up my order was told brownie is not for 5.00 but for 6.29 and they will not adjust the price. since you are getting something already on special. (nick) so no thank you. saved me 38.00 and will not return."}
{"text":"Never getting pizza here again. Horrible not worth the money. Hand tossed pizzas are also flat. Wonder what a thin and crispy looks like. Seriously?! What has happened to pizza"}
{"text":"First of all, I know it seems kind of redundant to review a chain like Pizza Hut, but our order was so disappointing from this particular store, I thought I would try and warn anyone considering this option. When you order from a place like Pizza Hut you've come to expect a dirty pie, an over the top cheese-fest, oozing with pepperoni grease and toppings. We basically paid $30 for 3\" thick greasy dough ball. There was hardly any cheese or toppings. You could see many areas with no coverage at all, just sauce and dough! I've had better pizza from Dr. Oetkers for $3.00!. All I could taste was the heaps of grease this pizza absorbed while cooking. 

You would think that a franchised chain with multiple location across North America would have some consistency or quality control, nope."}
{"text":"Good service. I always go there to pick up my $10 online pizza deal. Always on time. Pls don't close this one"}
{"text":"Pizza Hut is Pizza Hut. It is what it is, and what it is is chain pizza. Of the major pizza chains, it is my favorite. Most of the time I go for local pizza places, but I always have to try the weird specialty limited time only pizzas that the hut is talking about in their commercials. I tried the hot dog crust pizza and was pleasantly surprised that it was actually the perfect hangover food. We got the giant two foot pizza when the Olympics were on. The ultimate cheesy crust pizza is their special now, and I must say that it's quite good. Also their breadsticks are always delicious. I usually order delivery from here, Vs eating in. It is perfect for nights when I'm feeling socially awkward and don't wanna talk to anyone and can just order online."}
{"text":"come here when you're full, because by the time you get your pizza, you'll be hungry.

yes i am indeed implying that these people are slower than snails"}
{"text":"Love this Pizza Hut! Love it when we especially have Katy waiting on us. Everyone is friendly and really love the fact that they now have gluten free pizza.  I can now eat there again. Hopefully the will get some more items I can eat. Great place to eat."}
{"text":"Ok, I never write Yelp reviews but this got my blood boiling... Worst service ever!!! 

I called in to order a pizza for pickup, when I arrived nobody was up front.. I waited almost 10 minutes at the counter trying to signal someone to come up (you'd think if knowing someone was coming to pick up an order, someone would be at the counter). After trying to signal multiple delivery guys who were walking to no avail, I literally just started shouting to get someone to come up, as I could hear the conversations the workers were having in the back. 

When I did finally get someone's attention, two people came out and half apologized. Thanks. Never going to this location ever again."}
{"text":"Came in for the lunch buffet that starts at 10:30AM for $5.99.
The pizza was OK, nothing spectacular.
One pepperoni pizza had MINIMAL cheese on it and there wasn't any covering the painted-on sauce. This was a classic case of bread fluff painted with sauce and lightly dusted with cheese.
If you've read my other reviews in the past you know how I feel about this.

I snidely asked one of the ladies \"What's missing on this pizza?\"
She said the cheese drifts when the pizza is cut.

WELL GUESS WHAT!!!
THE CHEESE WOULDN'T TRAVEL IF THERE WAS ENOUGH ON THERE!!

I didn't feel like being a dickhead so I let it go.
She said she would talk to the cook about it.

I still had my fill of some of the other pizzas.
At least it's not Pizza Patron, who wouldn't know pizza if Mr. Grimaldi himself rammed his pizza down their throats with the butt of a baseball bat."}
{"text":"It's disappointing to me that the chain that I have such fond memories of is still continues not to please its customers.  I called the Pizza Hut on McKnight Road to place a carryout order on at 6pm.  It sounded like the call went to a call center; the lady on the other end graciously took my order, repeated it, and said that it would be available for pickup at stated restaurant at 6:19pm.  Perfect - I get to the Pizza Hut at 6:20 and when I approached the counter to pick up my pizza, I was told that the order \"just popped up on my screen and it would be another 20-25 minutes.\"  I quietly said to myself - What do you mean just popping up on your screen - I called over 20 min ago to put the order in?!?  If you don't get it together, there are other pizza places that people will go to...but don't  worry, I won't be back!"}
{"text":"I am a regular at this location and will no longer be one if I can help it....it seems to only be a problem with the night crew there as I have had ok experiences with the day crew.....all I want it extra salt on my pretzel crust with pepperoni.....without fail I am disappointed....I go in there now after waiting 30 minutes to pick up my pizza  then to come in and it be incorrect yet again I usually just take it and am posses off about it but this time I ask for it to be corrected and they tell me that it will be another 30 minutes....an hour for a pizza....I ask for my money back from a worker with the most disgusted look on her face...I myself have resting bitch face but this was not the case with her...I then hear the workers in the back talking shit about the extra salt and how they hate that shit and some other stuff about my order....don't want to hear me complain?? Then possibly make my correctly the way I asked and put it on my special request area? And since there apparently no corporate I can call about this as the assistant manager told me....I come to you yelp.....honestly what a horrible way to keep customers going to your business."}
{"text":"We have gone to this Pizza Hut in the past and were not satisfied with the service. When we first moved to our house, this location and the one at Lawyers & Margaret Wallace both argued as to which location was supposed to deliver to us! We didn't feel like leaving the house last night and decided to give them another chance. They were 20 minutes late, the pizza and wings were cold, and the customer service was terrible! I will not be ordering from this place again. I am really surprised this location has been in business as long as it has."}
{"text":"This was THE worst Pizza Hut experience I have ever had. I called because the pizzas that were delivered were not what we ordered. I asked if they happened to know they gave us the wrong pizza, or made the wrong type of crust, and the 'manager' was nothing but rude. Kept telling me he didn't know who I was and said that he makes all the pizzas himself, and if I reordered, he would make them the same way again. Why is this pizza so flat?!! There is no sauce on it either! Cmon Pizza Hut. I will never go back to this location."}
{"text":"Normally I dont have too many issues with phut.. I mean i normally js gey wings and how can you ruin that right?! WRONG! 
Ordered  wings and a personal pan pizza. I get traditional bone ouy becaise i don't like nor can I eat yhe Breading.  My food came in about 45 mins, I open the door, he goes to pull out the food,  and the wings go crashing all over the ground. Sauce EVERYWHERE. So now im hungry and had to wait for them to be remade and delivered. I don't know if it was the fact that they were about to close or what, but when the driver returned the wings were half done, the skin was soggy and breading falling apart which was weird since  i ordered traditional wings.  Waited two hours basically and still went to bed hungry.  The only reason I'm giving the two stars is because my driver (although  clumsy) was the nicest  guy ever and was really apologetic about the situation,  I felt bad."}
{"text":"The last two times I have ordered from this restaurant they have been out of a certain ingredient that I wanted. First time it was ham. Second time it was medium pan crust. Canceled the order this time.Poor management. I will never order from Pizza Hut again period."}
{"text":"So it was a World Series game night and I ordered pizza by phone. The order was taken down wrong and then I received partial of the wrong order. After trying several times to call someone to no avail I went back to the store. The line was long but I waited because I wanted to see how I would be received. While waiting I opened an online account and saw my order for pizza 7.99 on monitor. The manager attended to me professionally listening to my problem and let me know how long it would be to receive the next Pizza. I decided to wait and also received the rest of the first order. I will always use my account to do all the ordering. I feel there won't be any mistakes on there part and you get points/credit for your patronage."}
{"text":"Ordered a pizza and the driver didn't wait for somebody to answer the door and left after he said he would stay for a few minutes. Called the driver twice and he forwarded my calls. Called the store and they said they would send the driver back, waited another 20 minutes before calling the store and the store is closed right now and I still don't have my order. Terrible customer service and now my family is hungry because of their delivery driver!"}

{"text":"One server for the whole place. Service was very slow. Three guys in the kitchen. What is all the yelling in the kitchen? Why does a cook need sunglasses in the kitchen?  Pizza Hut is slowly dying when it comes to quality of service."}
{"text":"Staff is not good. They were more concerned on making jokes than making a smooth transaction. Spent 3 minutes waiting for the phone order taker to stop laughing (while taking credit card info....so that isn't worry-some). Do yourself a favor and call a different pizza place. Terribly disappointing experience. Should be a 1 star but a huge fan of the Pizza Hut brand."}
{"text":"Usually order online but decided to stop in on my way home. I was told it would be a 15 minute wait, after 30 minutes it was finally ready. Not to mention the whole time we were waiting we could here the employees in the back goofing off and using bad language. They were teenagers but should be taught how to act when customers are around."}
{"text":"This is the worst pizza two topping pepperoni and sausage sauce very thin sauce the cheese could barely be seen the taste was horrible. Taste like eating cardboard. The wing was  not completely done. Horrible don't deserve a star I want my money back."}
{"text":"Typical Pizza Hut pizza - hot and filling.  Delivery was quick, on time and the delivery person was very curteous.  No complaints."}
{"text":"Stood at the counter for immersurable time waiting for somebody to emerge while employees ranted loudly in the back, complaining about not getting TIPS theyre not even entitled to. 

Maybe i should tell them why. 

Or maybe their manager should."}
{"text":"I stopped in here to eat while waiting on a tire change at Discount Tire.  I thought this was supposed to be a family restaurant. The waitress (girl) had on shorts so short, she probably should have been working at the Candy Store instead.  SHAME on Pizza Hut for not enforcing a better dress code. Sitting in a booth & having someone come to serve you your food with their rear end hanging in your face is not very professional.  Sorry... will not go back.  Can't even remember how the food tasted because this ruined the whole experience."}
{"text":"This has to be one of the worst Pizza Hut in Las Vegas. I don't know what happened over the last year but as far as customer service concerned they just don't  give a damn. Every time I come in for my pizza it's excuse after excuse after excuse. Today they lost my pizza and they don't know where it is so do you think they would take time to tell me this no.../they make me wait in the lobby for eternity. So now they are remaking my pizza because they don't know where my pizza is. It's already been 40 minutes....and people are walking out left and right with their pizzas right now. Except me I have to wait another 15 minutes for it to come."}
{"text":"First time coming here.... lets just say I won't be back. When my sister and I walked in, there was atleast half the tables still full of plates and trash. and my concern is the place didnt look busy at all. they had two tables of people sitting and eating. The food was great and all. but even the service wasnt up to par. the waitress stopped by our table once and that was to drop off the check. I had to flag her down to even fill up our cups which were empty for atleast 15 minutes. the manager of this place needs to stop by here and see how their business is being run. either they don't have enough people working to cover or the employees don't care. I'd be more than happy to drive the extra 10 minutes to another Pizza Hut to eat. is wont waste the time or money to eat here again."}
{"text":"For lunch I went 3 times. You just wait and wait forever. It was empty and I am not only talking about the customers.  \"Please wait to be seated\"  don't wait, just get out."}
{"text":"After having a terrible online ordering experience with the Burhamthorpe location, I thought I'd never give pizza hut my business again. That said, I really like Pizza Hut's pizza, so I decided to give this locate a try. 

PHD has a really cool look to it, kind of similar to Krispy Kreme. There's a seating area and beside it, you're able to see the oven which your pizza goes into and comes out of. 

The cashiers are really friendly at this location and the pizza is quite good. I'd still avoid ordering online, but I find walking into this location and ordering to go no problem."}
{"text":"Used to be different but recently they have been messing up. I ordered food and they messed up so I contacted their DM and they gave me a $15 credit. Used the credit to order and my wings came raw. Never ordering again."}
{"text":"Terrible food.   I ordered 2 stuffed cheese crusts. .. one was made wrong,  it was suppose to be cheese only ours wasn't,  apparently when you put in certain codes it changes your order? 

I don't know how but the pizza was undercooked but dried out... made very sloppy, messy, terrible flavors.
Could barely eat one piece! Greasy cheese crust wasnt defined so there was no cheese crust really just melted all over....yuck!

Crust was so thin in the middle could barely pick up a piece yet it was doughy.

Not worth another try."}
{"text":"Disgusting... is all I can say. I was waiting for about 5 minutes  for my food. Not the problem. the problem was the drivers coming back and from deliveries and walking back NOT washing their hands. Then making salads. Gross! They are dealing with money, driving, who knows where their hands have been.  I'm just watching them continue to make salad after salad. Hands in the lettuce cheese, banana peppers, onions,  very disgusting.  My food was OK. Cheese sticks were cold,pasta  was good. Ordered a personal  pizza  with crushed red pepper flakes on the crust. Nope didn't  get that either."}
{"text":"Do nooot ever order from here they are the worst. They never answer im writing this review as im on hold waiting for an answer. I have already called like 10 times. Ive been waiting for my delivery for over an hour and yet has not arrived. I called and through a manger and she didnt do anything. Do not order from here they are the worst !!!! This dosent even deserve a one star review"}
{"text":"I wish zero was an option here. I normally don't write reviews but I've had it with this location. Ordered online at 4:17 pm and got a confirmation my order would be here by 5:02 pm, my order arrived at 5:46 pm and my toddler and I are starving. Food was cold and chewy and I had ordered crispy thin crust. Bread sticks are stale and they neglected my extra sauce for my wings which were equally just as bad. Save your money and get a frozen pizza because you'd get better quality than that. I won't even bother calling the location as I've had problems with their service in the past but after this I will never use them again. Seriously go somewhere else!"}
{"text":"I just placed an order over the phone and spoke with Haley, she was excellent! So much better customer service than I've had for really any food delivery. She was knowledgable about the specials and new menu items, made some recommendations, confirmed my order and total and forecasted a realistic time frame, all while being nice and conversational. I'm blown away with this level of service at a chain pizza place. Great job!"}
{"text":"Awesome customer service and the pizza and wings are always cooked to perfection ... the management team there v is great which makes all the employees friendly and so helpful. at his is the best pizza Hut location by far in my opinion. keep up the great service!!"}
{"text":"Well I would have to say this one gets the good choice for a Lunch Buffet.  The Lunch buffet is all you can eat and it features pizza, salad bar, pasta, and dessert pizza's.  

Good Choice for a quick and inexpensive lunch.  

Whoever came up with the idea for a dessert pizza very good call.

Like I said its inexpensive and you can never go wrong with Pizza, at least for me that is................."}
{"text":"This place is messing the name of Pizza Hut.  Horrible pizza and not even baked. Called and complained about it that the pizza was dougy and not baked and not hot either.  They were happy to get us a new pizza and that was no good either.  Something is not right at this location."}
{"text":"Wow, wish I had read the reviews before we placed our order.  What a ridiculous experience for ordering pizza delivery.  After two hours of waiting for our pizzas to come I attempted to call the store but the phone just rang and rang.  I finally got through to Janelle to find out if we even had an open order, which she confirmed that our order was on the way.  When we finally did recieve our order it was cold and had to be reheated in the microwave.  Janelle did give a half hearted apology but never even bothered to call us to follow up,  Almost thirty dollars for two cold pizzas that took over two hours to get to our house is ridiculous."}
{"text":"I'm dying..... Oh man.....

Dont try the new crunchy stuffed crust.....

Not sure if it was \"that\" pizza or something they put in it....

3 hours in washroom...

Arghhh"}
{"text":"Terrible food. Never order from this Pizza Hut. I would go out of my way to choose a different Pizza Hut location. I complained about my pizza having almost nothing on it to the manager - Lisa. I cannot believe someone this rude and disrespectful works in customer service, let alone IS THE MANAGER!!"}
{"text":"Pizza will always be Pizza Hut but this location has terrible customer service. Ordered pick up and I was waiting in the lobby for awhile before someone even acknowledged me. To make it worse, it still took awhile before the employee went out to the front and helped me. Maybe they were really busy but they should really take care of their customers right away especially when there's only one customer in the lobby."}
{"text":"The pizza from here is horrible. The pizza sauce is super tart and i got an upset stomach from it. I will never order from here this location again."}
{"text":"Solid Pizza Hut.  We like to order online for pickup and it's always ready when we arrive to pick it up at the quoted time.  Took one star off because their staffing needs work.  These guys are running around like chickens with their heads cut off.  Come on management, help them out!"}
{"text":"Ordered online and made a note to not ring the doorbell because we have a sick family member sleeping. Paid with card online and was told it would take 40 minutes. An hour and 15 minutes later the delivery guy Randy rang the doorbell and asked for payment because there records showed it wasn't paid for, despite my verification email. Shortly after he left, he called me from his personal phone saying that we still didn't pay and that he would wait on hold while I checked my bank statement . I hung up and called the store to have it resolved and make payment if still necessary with a supervisor, just to find out that Randy was the supervisor and they \"figured it out\". 
Literally only gave this place these 2 stars because the pizza and breadsticks were delicious as usual. Probably won't order again though due to the lack of attention to detail, poor management, and failure to stand by their delivery times as stated."}
{"text":"Horrible horrible horrible customer service!! Very rude and unprofessional employees.  Erica is especially rude. I Will never order from them again. My husbands work will never order from them as well. I'm a teacher and used to use Pizza Hut for all of our meetings/ parties but never again. Very disappointed in Erica's in professionalism and Rude behavior. I will be sure to make sure people know about my bad experience."}
{"text":"I recommend you avoid this location. Ordered pizza last night, when it came i should have opened the box - the box was crushed in like it had been driving around with 10 pizzas stacked on top of it - when I opened it half the pizza was stuck to the top - called to complain and they wanted to give me a 10% discount. Life is too short to deal with sub-mediocre food delivered by people who could care less if it gets to you in one piece or not. I normally don't rate a pizza delivery but this one finally convinced me to give up Pizza Hut for good. Bottom line is the food is just not that good and the people could care less."}
{"text":"Always good pizza nice and fresh really enjoy the wings as well they can be spicy even if you order mild so I just get salt and pepper, they have good deals and it's always hot and fresh! Love this location."}
{"text":"This is my favorite pizza place! Logan and Sadie are so helpful at front counter, and the pizza tastes amazing! It looks amazing!"}
{"text":"While the food here is pretty consistent, it is a chain restaurant after all, the service is spotty at best. Pizza Hut is my favorite chain for pizza. I know, I know, but it's a childhood thing so be gentle here. Every other order I get from here is either wrong, cold, or takes forever. 

Today I went in to pick up a couple of pizzas for my kiddos.  While I was waiting for the clerk to finish with a couple dining in I noticed that there were signs all over the counter saying that there was now a charge for cheese and peppers. Let me rephrase that, it said, \"Now available for purchase\". Sneaky, huh?  I don't know why exactly but this totally rubs me the wrong way. I have both of these items at home so I didn't have to purchase any but I would have been pretty ticked to pay almost an extra dollar for some fake parm! What's next? McDonald's charging for ketchup packets? They said it's because people take too many and then just throw them away. I'm sure that happens often and it's unfortunate but a part of the business. I'm going to be in trouble if Starbucks starts charging for cream and sugar.

I think I'll find a different location to use. If they are that hard up for cash that they need to charge for cheese and peppers who knows what other short cuts they're taking."}
{"text":"Made an order online, waited an hour and it was never delivered. When I called the next day i spoke with Angie who put me on hold for a manager, when the manager ( i believe his name was Chris) answered and i explained my situation and he put me on hold again. Angie then got on the phone to tell me her manager needed me to call at another time because they were too busy. This location has the worst service."}
{"text":"This location seems to dish out what Pizza Hut pizzas should be. They are good and consistent. Toppings seem fresh and the staff is friendly. This is a take-out one so they don't play around...no restaurant to go through, delivery is cheap too. Not my favorite pizza or gourmet by any means but when you're craving pizza, don't want to spend a lot, and have this so close...I order from here occasionally. As the three star rating says, A-OK."}
{"text":"I rarely eat pizza, so I gave in to ordering through the phone App because I was too lazy to go out and get a real pizza.  So basically I got what I deserved...a nasty, under cooked pizza.  I usually order from Domino's, but recalled Pizza Hut being better.  I was wrong!  Next time I'm lazy and want a cheap pizza, I won't be ordering here.  

It's definitely quick service and the driver was nice, but that's about it.  The phone App is horrible.  I had to try several times to get my order in the cart correctly because it would take me to a web page and then clear my order.  That was my first warning sign, but I chose to ignore it.  The pizza toppings are carelessly spread throughout the pizza and the dough is under cooked and not even crunchy.

I did order the dessert brownie.  That was the only thing that was decent."}
{"text":"I recently ordered from the location on S.Decatur in Las Vegas.  The delivery driver was great and the food was even better.  I normally complain about pizza delivery, yet this time I must admit no complaints, extremely satisfied!!!  Thank you"}
{"text":"What a horrible customer service experience. I decided to try my local Pizza Hut for the first time. 

I ordered online and the website froze. After calling their customer service to make sure my card wasn't charged I called the store number given to me by customer support to see make sure an order wasn't placed and to order something. 

The first person I talked to told me they had the same deal as online but that they didn't deliver to my address. I called the store she gave me only to be told they didn't deliver to my address either. I called the first store back and asked for the manager. He told me they did deliver to my address. I was forced to spell out the name of my street several times and give examples of the street name in sentences.  Then he tells me  he couldn't provide me the same deal as online and it would cost me extra money for something I didn't want. 

I decided the $5 extra dollars for Papa John's was worth it because at least Papa John's website works, they can in fact find my address, and they care about making things right for their customers."}
{"text":"One Of My Favourites, Delivery Was On time Driver Very Nice Excellent Pizza"}
{"text":"I've ordered from this particular Pizza Hut 3 times. Given 3 Chances, no more! The pizza has been 2 hours later than the given estimated delivery time. 
The first time they gave us our money back and we reheated the pizza in our oven. The second time it was 1 hour late ( on top of the 2 hour delivery time) because the driver forgot part of someone else's order and had to go back to the restaurant before delivering mine, had to reheat in oven yet another time. (We live 13 min from them) 
The third time we ordered at 8pm and didn't receive our late dinner until 10:30 pm! What? 

Today I tried just one more time. ( apparently I don't learn my lesson?) 
I tried the app and it wouldn't take my order. I called the store at 11am and they said their driver wouldn't be in until 12.. ( their website says delivery from 11am-12am btw) I called back at 12pm. They informed me that they aren't doing deliveries today.. The driver decided he wasn't working today. Sooooo why do they only have 1 unreliable driver?!"}
{"text":"Aweful place to get pizza from... I found hairs in my pizza... Hygiene is important if your making other people's food... They probably were not wearing hair nets I'm guessing. If you like hair in your pizza then feel free to go back here and order pizza from them."}
{"text":"Made a account just to right this review and I wish there was a 0 I could give. I ordered a pizza from them and didn't receive it till 1 1/2 hrs late. First off it was warm to cold and the cheese was already hardening. Why this was idk since I stay about no more than a mile down the road. I bit into the pizza and nothing but dough! I called them and asked if I could talk to the manager which was Veronica and she was completely rude once I told her what happened. I spoke to her very calmly and never once was rude. When I asked for my refund she told me she'll give me a credit and next time ask for my pizza well-done! WTF who orders a pizza undercooked for there to be a option to ask for one well-done? First of all Veronica dough needs to be cook to a certain temperature since it contains eggs which can lead to a food borne illness smart ass. Even though I already knew it was BS I called 2 other pizza huts and confirmed there wasn't a such thing. NEVER will I EVER order from Pizza Hut again. Last Pizza Hut I tried was a complete disaster as well. Pizza Hut please train these franchises a bit more."}
{"text":"Pizza was fine, but two packets of cheese and two packets of peppers for a large pizza...such a generous location. Southwest has been ordering from this spot for years. Take care of the southwest. Two star for the two packets received."}
{"text":"She took the liberty to add a tip to my visa card when I went in for carry out! Fraud!!!"}
{"text":"I just ordered from this location & I am disappointed. Both pizza's was missing an ingredient. I ordered 2 pizza's & both were messed up. One pizza had the middle missing ingredients. The other pizza was not flavored crust. The photos can tell more."}
{"text":"I got pizza from this place all the time and never had any problems. Don't know why it has bad previews"}
{"text":"Wish I could give ZERO stars. Horrible customer service. Horrible. Horrible. How do people get jobs when they clearly have ZERO customer service skills. I am shocked how this girl could be so rude and so clueless and continue to maintain a job. Management must not care. Clearly.  Wow!"}
{"text":"Ordered delivery.. Got Parmesan Garlic wings & chicken Alfredo w breadsticks. Couldn't be more disappointed. the wings were mediocre at best and I don't think they put any Alfredo sauce at all in the pasta. the breadsticks were also burned to a crisp.. not impressed. whatsoever."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I love Pizza Hut; however, I think we're going to be ordering from another business.  
   We've order three different times, and each time we've gotten wrong orders.  It's too \"common\" to have mistakes every time we order.  This is ridiculous.  The line people need to pay attention to what they're putting on each order; the cutter (who's often a manager) should be double checking that the toppings match the order; and finally (not in all stores) drivers check the orders before loading up for a run.  So, after all that which could have prevented this, all three times we've gotten wrong orders.  WTF!?   I recommend that you go elsewhere."}
{"text":"Put my feet up and ordered in. What came was a thin crust Pizza could be faxed to you and taste just as good. I also got one with everything that looked liked it could scare Jeffrey Dahmer.  So many options in Surprise why bother with this one."}
{"text":"Horrible Service!!! Pick up time was 7:40 and we didn't leave till 8:05. They told us our pizza would be out in a couple minutes so we waited, after waiting for 20 minutes the girl pulls out the same pizza that was sitting in the warmer when we got there. Idiots!!!!!! I didn't want to ask for a fresh pizza because they all looked like the type of people to spit in your food after complaining. After getting home pizza was cold. What a waste of money, I will I never go to Pizza Hut again!"}
{"text":"This was the first time we ordered from this specific Pizza Hut. The food was great and prices were ok. The woman answering the phone was nice. But the delivery took almost two hours! We live a little far away, but it's only a little less than 10 minutes ( around 8 minutes). We ordered at 6:00 and got the pizza from late 7 to early 8! We will probably continue to order from Pizza Hut, most likely just not this one. Or at least for delivery."}
{"text":"IF I COULD GIVE THIS PLACE ZERO STARS, I WOULD. This place is literally five minutes away from my house and my order took over an hour to get there! I only got the $10 dinner box! I called in and spoke to the manager, Tony, who doesn't know a thing about customer service! He said that they were low on delivery drivers which is why they were late but if they could have called and informed us about their problem, I would have understood! Do not order from here. Tony did an awful job. Never ordering from here again."}
{"text":"So I was craving pizza one night, and quickly searched on Yelp for the nearest dine-in Pizza Hut in my area and ended up here! 

You rarely see dine-in pizza restaurants these days. They're usually just take-out or delivery, but it's been awhile since I sat down and enjoyed a slice fresh out of the oven and not out of a delivery van. 

I wasn't here for the All You Can Eat Pizza, so can't really relate to previous reviews. I noticed right away that they had some creative additions to their menu: Creamy butter chicken, cheesy beef poutine, savory Asian BBQ, Smokey Maple Bacon & Grilled Chicken Club. I wanted to try all of them, but decided on just the butter chicken & poutine toppings. 

The Butter Chicken pizza was AMAZING. They should put a patent on this flavour because it is the bomb. Generous pieces of chicken, roasted red peppers & mozzarella with the right amount of curry sauce on pan crust. DELICIOUS. 

The Beef Poutine flavour was MEH. There wasn't enough cheese, and the few strands of fries on the pizza was crispy but lacked flavor. Overall, this pizza tasted too bland and dry. 

The current deal is one of the above pizza for $15 and get the second medium pizza for $10.99! I had to pack the leftovers, which were still delicious the next day for those who enjoy cold pizza. 

Our server was also AMAZING. I can tell she could carry a conversation with anyone. She seems to genuinely enjoy her job and can describe one type of pizza for as long your ears are open. I don't have pizza cravings often, but when I get them again, I'm coming back here!"}
{"text":"I live in the area and always order from this Pizza Hut never once have I had a problem. The food is always fresh and hot upon delivery or pick up."}
{"text":"Pros: Friendly, fast, professional, consistent. 

Cons: No dining in

Details: I am not sure what some of the negative reviews are about. I have had both delivery and carry-out from this location and always been satisfied. It tastes like Pizza Hut so if you like that style of pizza you get it. The staff has always been great and friendly. This location is carry-out or delivery only. Of the Pizza Huts I have been to in my life, this is one of the better ones."}
{"text":"When I want thin n crispy...please don't throw in a pan crust...if you run out of the thin crust dough tell me, even if I order online.  After about 5 times of the same thing, we're giving this location a temporary rest.  However the staff here is friendly and the grub is outstanding.  :)"}
{"text":"I've had mixed experiences in the past with this Pizza Hut but in the last six months they have been great. Prompt, accurate, and polite. They have also incorporated a rewards program through Belly. Their rewards are easy to earn and pretty good items (free drink or flavor bread sticks on second visit.) come here and enjoy pizza and wings in 15 minutes from ordering."}
{"text":"Terrible service! We ordered from the hard rock hotel and not only were they an HOUR late, when we called the restaurant they were extremely rude and hung up on us before we could ask anything other than if the pizza was on it's way. We were looking for an affordable alternative for food before hitting the clubs and we were extremely let down. We won't be doing this again."}
{"text":"These idiots put about 6 pieces of chicken on my entire large pizza, and then they proceeded to whine at me when I complained. Way to cheap out. This wasn't just once either, it happened 3 or 4 times before we completely stopped going to this location. Terrible pizza and terrible service; when I call you out on cheaping out, at least don't give me attitude for it."}
{"text":"Going to stop in store....the food got me sick on top of being nasty..i missed the next day of work.... had diarrhea and stomach cramps all threw out the nite!! Will be contacting their manager...unbelievable"}
{"text":"I've only lived in this area for a year and since Pizza Hut pizza isn't that good to begin with, I've only got food from here twice and OF COURSE both times they screwed it up.  I had been craving their bread sticks so I got them with my pizza and they forget the sauce.  Like, really???  How do you forget the sauce... That MAKES the breadsticks.  Thinking they couldn't be dumb enough to mess up an easy order for the SECOND time, I ordered buffalo chicken pizza and there's no buffalo sauce on it!!!!!  Are. You. Kidding. Me.  And fast food workers want paid $15/hr... SMFH."}
{"text":"Pizza, pizza, pizza!  That opportunity to get great hot pizza can be expected when calling Pizza Hut for pickup or delivery!  I normally get a variety of pizzas....(except meat lovers) like pepperoni, and cheese and veggie!  All very good!  A side of garlic parmesan wings is always great with the pizza!"}
{"text":"I'd give it zero stars if I could, based solely on service.  The pizza was typical Pizza Hut--I don't think it ever tastes different.  I called in my order on a Friday night and was told it would be 15 minutes.  I got there right around then, paid (wasn't given a receipt), and was told my order was still in the oven.  Okay, no big deal.  I assume they'd let me know when it was done.  that was a mistake!!  After sitting there another 15 minutes (so, 30 minutes after I had originally called and was told it would be 15 minutes) I finally asked.  They asked for my receipt--it was a different cashier--and looked annoyed at me that I didn't have it.  She reluctantly went to check on my order and brought it back.  When I told her how long I'd been sitting there waiting she said, \"Oh I didn't realize you were waiting.\"  Oh really?  You get a lot of people just hanging out here not waiting for a pizza?  I can understand it being busy on a Friday night, but to not even apologize for their complete lack of service really ticked me off.  We rarely order chain pizza anyway, but the next time I need to for some reason, it will not be from here!"}
{"text":"This Pizza Hut is not the best. It's hit or miss every time I order. There's never anyone in the restaurant but it takes forever!!"}
{"text":"I ordered at 8:10PM and received the order at 10:02PM. 
The order was missing the toppings I ordered. 
When I called the store around 9:35PM, the employee said you should have not placed the order online. However their phone system suggested that placing the order online is faster.
The Pizza looked worse than our corner pizza place's pizza.
The pasta we ordered was bland and there were no condiments included.
I hate the overall experience. Never coming back to you guys."}
{"text":"This is the location that delivers to me. They always pleasantly surprise me with delivery times. Every delivery person has been pleasant as well.

The pizza is pretty good. Better than pizza pizza. There's just something about that pizza hut taste that rubs me the right way. The best thing ever though, is stuffed crust. It is like heaven on earth, in your mouth. I love it.

The downside is that Pizza hut is pricy. My pizza usually clocks in at 32 dollars. Pretty steep. But to me it's worth it, once in a while.

If you haven't tried Pizza huts stuffed crust yet, then you have sinned. Absolve yourself by trying it at your next opportunity."}
{"text":"I ordered take out from this location several times and they have been nice and courteous from answering the phone to pick upthanks"}
{"text":"There is nothing more infuriating than ordering pizza with crushed tomato sauce and getting NO sauce at all!!! This is the last time you get my money for shitty pizza. And yes it's happened at this location before! Done with you!"}
{"text":"3 orders in a row were late and cold. 

They are the closest store to my home.  Never again. Took me 3 orders but I'm done."}
{"text":"Placed an order at 8:02pm on Saturday night and was told about 45 minutes for delivery. At 9:35pm I phoned the restaurant to see where my food was. The general manager, JoAnn, advised me she was having a problem but the food was on the way. She was curt and unapologetic. 10:00pm I phoned back because the food did not arrive yet. JoAnn was downright rude this time, mocking my question as to where my food was by telling me she has no way of knowing where the delivery man is at any given time. She seemed pissed at ME for not being more understanding to HER plight. I demanded a call from the district manager and a refund. She informed me it would take weeks for the refund. She told me the food was not sitting around getting cold and would arrive hot. 10:20pm the food arrived. It was cold, the chicken wings were bloody. No call from the district manager. Called the store back on Sunday. JoAnn told me the bad food, 2 1/2 hour delivery and all was out of her control. I again demanded a call from the district manager. He finally called back and informed me never to order from his store again, that Pizza Hut corporate office would not care if I complained, and basically tough crap that the food was awful and the delivery ridiculously slow. He said his company owns all of the Cleveland stores so, basically, piss off. NO PROBLEM. All of this is going to corporate, not that I expect a corporation to actually give a crap if they do business with franchises like this. Bottom line: Don't go here unless you like spending lots of money for very slow delivery, cold, half-cooked food and a rotten attitude if you try and complain. Go to a local Mom & Pop pizza place, people who will actually appreciate your business and strive to give you good food and service."}
{"text":"Seems every year or so I have to go to Pizza hut just to remember how bad it really is. Honestly I don't know how that can call that baked stick of butter with cheese one it Pizza. While this location was at least clean and the staff was very friendly there is no getting past just how bad pizza hut pizza really is. The pizza at pizza hut taste like it is frozen and reheated. If you have to have it this location is great. If you have any taste in pizza you will just starve yourself and drive to chicago and get a real pie."}
{"text":"Well let me start off by saying that when you first wall in the place it smells like sewer!
The lady at the counter is also the lady making the pizza , how do I know this well her hands were full of white cheese (the older lady very nice but not so clean) and when I got my Debit card back it stuck like cheese!!  Gross I will not be going there again.  I hope she washes her hands before making the Pizza.  This is the Pizza Hut on 7th st and union hills."}
{"text":"We were on hold for OVER 10 minutes and then hung up on us. By the time we got to the place, they hung up on us!! Went in and they said a 50 minute wait AND said that there would be a $1 PER TOPPING charge which is NOT what it said on the online special!! This place is a rip off!!"}
{"text":"The worst pizza I have ever experienced. And to go along with that I had to wait forever to have that experience.
NEVER again. No Way, No how."}
{"text":"The food wasn't the problem, had the buffet on a Saturday afternoon, and there was plenty of pizza, breadsticks, salad, etc. But I was unaware that I should have brought my own 2 liter of pop. The waitress, Carolynne was BAD, never came to the table at ALL. But did stop at one of the tables near by many times. Now she maybe a good waitress but if she's has more than 1 table your in trouble!!!"}
{"text":"I didn't even placing my order before the rude worker on the phone pissed me off enough where I told her to cancel it and I hung up. Amazingly enough looking at other reviews it seems everyone else has the same problem. 

Get new staff. Get better attitudes. 

Don't even waste your time with a phone call. 

Pizza Hut get this store together, obviously this is an ongoing issue."}
{"text":"They are a higher volume pizza hut getting over well 200 orders a day. They sometimes make mistakes but they do their best to fix them. Most of the people that gave the place a bad reputation have either been fired or are having an eye kept on them. I eat here all the time and have no real issue. The delivery sometimes takes a bit but, they also have like two other people before me so, its fast given the circumstances."}
{"text":"This used to be a good location but now that they have that new manager it has really gone down. We now make our twice a week orders at papa johns. The manager travis at this location is a complete douche bag and was even mean to our delivery driver. This company will no longer get our business. Travis admitted he takes food from the trash to reserve to customers."}
{"text":"Second time I've ordered pizza from this location and they have canceled my order due to non-existent traffic. When I said that I live in a high rise and can see out of my window all of the incoming and out going traffic and that it was clear...they said \"well come and pick it up yourself.\" It was unnecessarily rude.  This call came 20 minutes after my order was even placed and delivery confirmed and it was even the second phone call to me after confirming my order. Ironically, I called Dominoes less than a block from them and they were more then welcome to assist and delivered fairly quickly."}
{"text":"Never more said the raven. Customer service is bad if the delivery guy deliver your pizza and it's bad they won't refund your money. What happened to customer service what happened to customer right."}
{"text":"So I was on hold since 10:40 for 20min and the phone cuts off I call back and they say we are closed, I explained the situation with the \"supposed manager\" named \"Kre\" who sounded like an adolescent child spoke very unprofessionally I found it hard to believe she is in the position she is in, she must have landed it by luck. Didn't resolve anything. And have no pizza unfortunately this is the nearest Pizza Hut."}
{"text":"How our pizza came from delivery $22 order to have it delivered looking like it fell on the floor board"}
{"text":"Received shockingly rude service here by some guy named Steve. Pizza was very late, and when I called in, was given attitude instead of an apology. I ended up canceling the order after waiting almost 2 hours.  People that rude should not be working in the service industry. Worst pizza hut ever."}
{"text":"Service sucks especially on the phone a girl that every time she sounds stoned gettin the orders wrong. Not paying attention when u r paying with card. Love pizza hut hate this location. Please somebody do something about it!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Great boneless wings on Wednesdays.
Clean eating areas and menu, but the service was extremely slow. I recommend for anyone coming in for a night out with the guys"}
{"text":"The store hours listed on yelp are wrong. They're open much later! Open 10:30 every day and close at 12am on Fri & Sat 11pm on Sun-Thurs. Ordering online is super easy! Make sure you look for the deals to make it worth every penny. Throw your delivery driver a few bucks and you'll make their night. My favorite is the Cock a Doodle Bacon add buffalo drizzle. Yum."}
{"text":"It is Pizza Hut so it's not your gourmet, NY, Chicago or wood fired style  pizza restaurant. I will say though when we have a house full of teenagers, it hits the spot. We've always ordered online and the order has always been correct, whether it's pick up or delivery. They have never been late of their estimated time and their deals are great."}
{"text":"Horrible experience at this pizza Hut! It is in a hotel and Casino, the lines are long and the workers are completely rude! They run out of things quickly, and when asked a question they respond with rude sarcasm! Very unhappy!"}
{"text":"I ordered online and it was ready when it said it would be. The pizza was good and the manager Justin was very helpful and nice. I would definitely come to this location again."}
{"text":"Only got 1 star because I can't leave 0.  Unfortunately this is the only Pizza Hut that delivers to my house which is why I almost never eat there anymore. I have seen it all from this place, from orders that never arrive to orders that take so long I cancel it then it shows up. If you order online don't believe the lie-o-meter that estimates he delivery time. It's now 45 minutes past the estimated arrival of 8:00pm. I will never order from this Pizza Hut again"}
{"text":"The Chardon Pizza Hut does a great job overall. The drivers are very personable and their speed is incredible. Whether you like the food or not is up to you, but they send it pretty clean and consistent, and the one time it was wrong, they made it wrong."}
{"text":"I got the $10 any pizza carry out deal. Ordered online. Super fast and easy. Cool people working there. Good customer service which is surprising for a big chain. They offered to give me my pizza for free because their online system didn't alert them to cut in squares as requested. Gotta appreciate that."}
{"text":"I originally picked delivery while ordering online but it read 1hr 40min-1hr 50min estimated delivery time. Carry out was only 20 min. My husband decided to pick it up instead and he said customer service was great. Food was ready at the time indicated online. 

I ordered the garlic knots pizza, traditional hot wings, and fries.  The garlic knots were good. They come with marinara dipping sauce and I also used the garlic butter sauce. The fries were amazing!!!!  We should have gotten 2 orders cause they went fast!  It actually over powered the pizza. Overall great Saturday late night spontaneous order. Next time we are just ordering wings and fries!"}
{"text":"I think this location is incredibly underrated. The pizza is absolutely amazing. I cannot stop ordering from . since I started it's been very hard for me to look elsewhere for pizza. Probably the only downside is that it's a little on the pricey side because of taxes Karma delivery charge and of course tipping the driver. Other than that the pizza is piping and tasty . The Hershey chip it cookie is to die for. Definitely one to get it's even good a day later"}
{"text":"Not the greatest choice,people upset while waiting 4 their order.after it took 15 minutes 4 someone 2 come 2 the front as the phone constantly ringing. As know one bothered 2 answer it @ all! I don't give this a star @ all. Go somewhere else."}
{"text":"So we decided to give this place another try after a real bad experience a few years back. Pizza was hot but all the toppings had slid to one side and this is what the boneless wings look like. Soggy nasty boneless wings. Take a lesson from BWW. Stay away at all costs."}
{"text":"Horrible! Give me my old location back! Ordered two pizzas and wings. They were 40 mins late and our order was wrong! Asked for extra sauce and got next to none. The wings were overcooked too. Everything was cold! We tried to call and fix things, but you get a national call center. Once we were finally transferred, they would just hang up on us! No more Pizza Hut for us!

So I lied... we went back. This time my wife went in the store to order. She ordered a chicken and spinach pizza with white sauce. These morons cooked the pizza and then threw uncooked spinach on top. This place is a joke!"}
{"text":"Wrong order then SICK!


So we ordered from this Pizza Hut because it is the only one that would deliver to us. They show up with two pizzas. One of them was the wrong pizza and the other pepperoni pizza barely had any cheese on it.  Calling the store about the order, the guy pretends that he doesn't understand what I am talking about, until finally he understands when I practically scream, You. Brought. The. Wrong. PIZZA! Okay he says, and he says he will send out the right pizza, and another pepperoni pizza with the right amount of cheese, after making me look online to make sure I had placed the right order. He let us keep the wrong pizza, but we had to return the pepperoni so he could show the cooks. 

30 minutes later. Yeah, I know, 30 minutes later, and the store is literally 5 minutes away, the pizza shows up.  

The next day, my wife had diarrhea all day, I kept going to the washroom, my 5 year old son had a stomach ache and went to the washroom multiple times, and my 3 year old daughter,  who only ate a bit, was complaining of stomach pains. 

I should have reported this Crap Hut.  But, I think I'm doing the next best thing."}
{"text":"Right now they have an offer of a 2 item large pizza for $7.99.  The level of service is what you can normally expect for a Pizza Hut and that is some mixture of teenage kids bumbling their way through things, but I can overlook that as long as the pizza comes out correctly."}
{"text":"My family wanted wings so I stopped by this location because my family has ordered here before but this was my first time, the wings had blood in them after asking for extra crispy garlic parmigian, I called to let them know and the manager was confrontational,  I brought the entire order back to show her and she pushed my new order of boneless at me,  what has happened to customer service, how was it the customer fault the chicken was bleeding, I took a picture of the poorly cooked chicken to remind me never eat here! why did yelp require I give them any star"}
{"text":"Slow, rude delivery driver, and gave me the wrong order on top of it. I normally don't order from Pizza Hut but thought id change it up a bit. Never again."}
{"text":"I ordered my pizza from this location. They told me 30 to 40 minutes even though I'm a mile away. So I waited past the hour and called back to see what happened to my order they got mad and said I'll get soon and hung up on me. They got bad customer service and not timely."}
{"text":"Pretty disappointed. Ordered pizza for pick up a while back ago and when I went in I had been waiting for a good 20 mins and everyone was staring at me wondering why I was there, when someone finally asked we had found out they didn't even start or cinnamon sticks we ordered, so we waited longer. To make up for it the manager said I would get $10 off my next order the next time I bought from them using my number, so of course I was extremely happy until I tried to get the $10 off and it wasn't actually put in... So thanks for lying to me I would've rather just left from waiting so long and not be disappointed about the situation later as well."}
{"text":"Stay far, far away.

My friends and I were getting together to play.. a game.. (definitely not D&D or anything, we're WAY cooler than that..).  On game nights, we try and keep things simple. Not everyone wanted pizza, and the people who wanted pizza wanted different things - Rosati's, Jupiter's, Papa Del's, Gumby's Pokey Stix, Domino's... So we chose a place everyone was OK with, at least in theory: Pizza Hut. We've been avoiding Pizza Hut for quite some time, due to an online order last year that the restaurant on Mattis never received. But, hey! Second chances, right? So we make an online order for a tray of pasta, 5 breadsticks, and 2 large pan pizzas with various toppings. Awesome. Estimated time for carryout: 20 minutes. Great. We live ten minutes away, so boyfriend & I finish packing for game night and leave. I call the restaurant on the way there to make sure that our order was indeed placed and would be ready soon. I was told it was in the oven and should be ready shortly. Yay!

We get there five minutes early. We see some food in the little warmy thing, but as no one gave us this food when we paid, we figured ours would be up soon. Two girls were working the registers and seating people. We pay, and one of the girls offers us a booth so we can sit while we wait. Courteous! We decline, though, because we're there to grab and go. 
So we stand around. 

Five minutes pass. We're still awkwardly standing in the entrance. Food is sitting in the warmer. Is it ours? Maybe? No, if it was our food, they'd have given it to us, right? They know we're here.

We wait.

I ask how much longer. The girl says she doesn't know, but she'll try and find out.

We wait.

Twenty FIVE minutes, we've been standing. We're now late for game night. The girl at the counter (the same one who took our money, the same one I asked about the length of our wait) smiles at us and asks if we've been helped yet.

WHAT. THE. HELL.

As it turns out, hey, that WAS our food in the warmy thing! It had been there SINCE WE ARRIVED TWENTY FIVE MINUTES AGO. She could have handed it to us AS SOON AS WE PAID. 

So, in short: the Pizza Hut on Mattis doesn't care about their customers, and there is pretty much no communication between the bakers in the back and the ditzes working the counter. Also, the decor is butt-ugly and the salad bar looks depressing and unsanitary (trust me, I had twenty-five minutes to inspect my surroundings). 

There are a host of other, better pizza places in Champaign, both national chain and locally-owned. Even Domino's isn't bad after their whole updated-pizza campaign. There is zero reason to go to Pizza Hut. Avoid it like the plague."}
{"text":"If I could I would give this location no stars or at least 1/3. I ordered pizza and wings online last week On 12/23/15 and it came 1h and 40 minutes late and cold, you could tell it was sitting their for a while. So I called the manager and let him know. He said : \"$ 17.00 credit and it will be written in the books\". Now fast forward to the present , today \"pizza Friday\" I called them to place an order with my \"STORE CREDIT\". They had no record of my order being placed and I only had a $10.00 credit. What? From $17.00. Down to $10.... Good thing I screenshot my order and the confirmation number."}
{"text":"I have ordered many Pizza Hut large pizzas in the past, but this one rated the absolute worst one ever. Marinara sauce? Where? It was so dry I had a couple pieces thinking the next piece would be better, wrong. I kept the rest for my wife to try, and her first words were, \"Where in the world is the sauce?\" I like to have to wipe my hands on napkins from time to time because it will have the garlic butter on the crust.... no need. DRY. Need I say more... don't get a pizza there unless you like it dry."}
{"text":"Not enough staffs.  Table are dirty and sticky.  Worst thing is lady washroom doors doesn't work.  Not to say locking the doors.  The doors won't even close probably."}
{"text":"I ordered my pizza at 6:42 pm. It's 8:37 pm. No pizza. The driver called me 48 minutes ago to \"confirm my address\" and said he had \"no idea\" what time my pizza would actually get here. Their phones roll over to a horrible call center with no customer service WHATSOEVER. I can see they have horrible reviews, something needs to change. I'm never ordering from them again."}
{"text":"I have to say that I did enjoy the pan pizza from this location. However, there was 1.5 pieces of pepperoni per slice (yes I counted). 8 slices of pizza, 12 pieces of pepperoni. That was disappointing."}
{"text":"Ordered online (8:02pm). Order to arrive (9:05pm). Called the store to inquire about my order and told he was on his way (9:13pm). I asked when i should contact them back, she told me '...in a few minutes.' Called back to cancel order, twenty-two minutes after it was promised. Was told the manager was too busy to cancel it (9:27pm). Driver calls my cell phone to ask which house is mine, and I told him I had cancelled order (9:51pm). Awful service, awful communication."}
{"text":"Ordered pizza at 9:40 for the delivery, at 10:40 I started calling them since I was told that it'd take 55 min. I'd been calling them for an hour and still got no answer same as no pizza. The most awful service I've ever gotten. I guess I'll have to go tomorrow to their location to deal with them. Ask for my money back and talk to the manager."}
{"text":"The pizza is great here, they have it ready when they say they will ....however......my review is on how far beyond the call of duty they go to help out a customer. I had a large order for our church group and it was a 20 minute drive to get it to them. The manager Ryan gave us a large warmer to keep it in so it remained good and hot.!!!!!! How sweet. The pizza arrived piping hot and I returned the warmer.
Thank you Ryan for your wonderful customer service. That is hard to find nowadays. Kudos to Pizza Hut for hiring someone like Ryan."}
{"text":"This place fucking is trash. Bad customer service. Said it would arrive at 1:15 but took over an hour to get here, and when it does arrive pizza is cold af and says there's nothing they can do but give me a discount on my NEXT purchase. Worst experience ever. FUCK THIS PLACE."}
{"text":"Stopped here to pick up an order of wings on my way home from work to go along with the pizza I picked up since Pizza Hut doesn't have great deals anymore. Ordered in the car and when I got there my name was on the tv and my food was ready. 

I had stopped eating and ordering their wings cuz they were really puny and small. But I recently discovered their wings are now pretty big and tasty. I ordered a 6 piece for about $7 bucks not bad at all. Opened up my box and was overwhelmed & happy that I actually got some wings and not wings sliced in half. On top they were oh so yummy!!! I could have these wings all the time and so much bigger than Wing Stop tiny little bitty wings. 

So I'm a fan of the wings again and will be stopping by again with my greedy ass! AND ALSO.....WHY DO ALL THE EMPLOYEES PARK DIRECTLY IN FRONT OF THE STORE WHERE PAYING CUSTOMERS HAVE TO PARK FAR AWAY? This is not good customer service."}
{"text":"Decided to redeem my points for a free 2 topping medium pizza. Well of course I had to pay for the delivery fee and 1 extra topping. But man oh man can you tell the difference in the quality and taste. I think once your receipt says \"free\" or \"points redemption\" they change how they make you're pizza.

Usually when I pay regular price my pizza is always full of topping and full. But this \"free\" pizza looked worse than a Little Caesars pizza. The flavor even tasted quite different from when I actually pay. But hey that's what I get for ordering the free pizza I was entitled to. 

But the dead giveaway was the order name on my receipt. \"Free\" and \"points redemption\" I knew then that was a bad sign. If there wasn't a difference why put it on there like that anyway? And they need to tell drivers to make sure to carry parmesan cheese at all times. Not everybody likes pepper!!!

HUGE THUMBS DOWN!!!

But 1 cool thing they started is something like Domino's pizza. After you order your pizza it lets you know where your pizza order has been received, then they are making your pizza, then the pizza is on it's way. And if you opt-in they even text you to let you know the pizza is out for delivery and on it's way."}
{"text":"Hands down the worse Pizza hut. Placed order at 8:02pm, called store twice(9:08pm and 9:32pm) spoke with a guy who said he was the manager,  did not tell me him name and was unprofessional. I ended up calling the corporate office and I sent my sister up there to get the \"manager's\" information and check the order status. She got there and they were blasting music like it was a club. Finally received my order at 10:01pm. I will never order from this location."}
{"text":"It's Pizza Hut. They're my go to when I want pizza fast. Yes, I like other small non-chain pizza shops, but Pizza Hut has pretty fast carry out. I live within 2 min and they're always ready at 15 minutes. I've never done their delivery but I don't have anything negative to say about their online carry out orders. They're always perfect."}
{"text":"Every time I have ordered from this store, I have never had a problem with the food. The pizza is always hot when I get there, is still hot when I get home 10 minutes later, and tastes delicious. I use online ordering because I can make the pizza exactly how I want, I get a confirmation email, and it's super convenient to access on my smartphone when I'm on the go.

The only issue I have is that the cashiers often act like it's an inconvenience to them that I come pick the pizza up. I feel like they're in no hurry to assist me when I walk in. I don't trust any delivery service to get any hot food to me, and I would like to be treated a little better when I make the effort to come get my food. However, that only cost them one star because the pizza is still wonderful."}
{"text":"I went there in the evening on Friday. I called ahead of time but I was on the phone waiting for someone to pick up for 12 minutes.
Then I got there and saw that there phone was ringing but they were ignoring it. It's *right* next to the register. So I just stayed on the phone and let it ring.
Finally, three minutes after I arrived and partway through my ordering process, a guy came to the phone by the *other* register and picked up. Puzzled after a moment of \"Hello? Hello?\" He hung up. 

I ordered a six inch cookie. I have been waiting ten minutes for a cookie, which cost me 6.50.
Why am I doing this to myself?

2 stars because at least they had friendly mannerisms in person."}
{"text":"Tastes like Pizza Hut but they just can't get there act together when it comes to timing. They will tell you 20 minutes for pick up but I have found myself waiting an additional 20-30 minutes every time I have been there!"}
{"text":"If I could give this establishment- zero stars I would. Hardly had any ingredients. I could buy a Albertsons brand frozen pizza & b more satisfied!"}
{"text":"I'm giving one star out of pity for the few and I mean few great people that work here. 

Ive gotten so many credits for errors I am no longer able to receive them. Honestly that should speak volumes but for the sake of insight I will proceed.

I personally never order from them anymore due to theft. I ordered. A large order and paid part in cash maybe 20 bucks and paid the rest on my card. U didnt give a too because the driver rushed me and the delivery took over 2 hours and I'm 5 minutes away. Long story short the driver pocketed the 20 bucks and said he didnt receive it. The cherry on top was that they voided the order in the system and charged it again. Therefore my card was charged for the entire order as if no cash was received.

So on top pf dishonesty, theft and lying customer service is non exsistant. Quality is poor to be polite. Pizza often comes crushed in the corner, dry and void of sauce and cold. 

Pickup is quick but then you have to deal with the attitude in person. To be honest I just order from Dominos now. This place needs new staff and management before it will ever get my business."}
{"text":"Alright so...

The first time I ate here I asked for extra sauce and got a dry pizza, but it was okay they were nice about it and the stuff crust was really stuffed. So this time I call ask for the same thing but explain really make sure there is extra, extra sauce  last time it was dry. 

When I go in to pick it up the guy was friendly and helpful and when I looked at the pizza it was dry again. When I told them that what I assume was the manager a tall, light brown, with glasses fellow. Said that it was extra sauce and already feeling the attitude, so I take a bite and as I thought it was dry no where near what I asked for and told him. He then gets more attitude about how I can't take a bite and expect another pizza. And I told him again this is not extra sauce and he insisted again it is. At which point I said it is not extra sauce to my preference. To avoid more argument I just asked for a side of sauce and left.

I don't know if just because how I was dressed in my casual clothes or what that made him assume I'm some erchant trying to get a free pizza but that was not the case. The whole experience was down right embarrassing and add someone who did fast food for a couple years I get it, alot of people do try to just get a free meal and can be very rude. But this was not the case with me and I assure you I will be going to Little Caesars across the street for now on. At least there I can save $10 on the pizza. It won't be stuff crust which is my favorite but when I want that I'll gladly drive over to the Boulder Highway location. At least there they listen when I ask for extra, extra, sauce and actually stuff the crust not pita tiny bit of cheese and leave a big air pocket!

The fact that the reviews reflect others misfortune with customer service (more so on Google) should of listened to the warnings. Not everyone is bad here there are good people that provide nice friendly service in fact poor Michael did a great job and looked so uncomfortable when the situation started going bad (sorry you had to be apart of that). But tonight I saw the ugly and the fact they allow someone with such poor customer service represent their store at any shift is a shame.

Do not treat your customers like they're free loaders, do not argue that they're wrong when they bring a legitimate complaint. Extra sauce may seem silly to some to write this kind of review that I'm just over exaggerating but it ruins the entire pizza experience for me and I do not take it trivial I want to enjoy my food even more so when I could go across the street and have the same lackluster experience but save $10 doing it. 

Teach some interpersonal skills for anyone you're going to have as \"management.\""}

{"text":"Horrible! It had a hair in the chicken. Don't feel any point in calling and complaining cause who knows what you will get next. Usually disappointed in Pizza Hut cause the food is either cold or just gross decided to try again. Just won't eat here again."}
{"text":"Pizza Hut hit my car! If you've had this happen to you, well you know the ending. Last week we ordered from our beloved neighborhood Pizza Hut as we've been doing for the past 20 years. Upon receiving my fresh pizza pie, I watched as our driver pulled away hitting our parked car.  Although damage was limited to a minimal amount of rubbing compound and a bit of anguish, I reach out to the management to report the incident. With the driver openly admitting hitting the car, I found myself having a very challenging and surprising discussion with the management. First it was the \"shift manager\" who stated right off the top, \"If I pursue this any further, the driver will be immediately fired, and since she can't afford to lose her job I should reconsider this.\" Asking to speak to her manager, I was told he was sleeping and not available (BTW, she had to ask another employee what was the name of her manager) Eventually the manger called me and we discussed the matter. Clearly I was very unaware of their \"you're on your own\" policy as I quickly learned, \"not our problem, take it up with the driver\". Followed up by, \"and if you do that she will probably quit any way so your basically out of luck\" - Okay, keep in mind, not looking to make a mountain out of a mole hill nor are we seeking any compensation. Just wanted to let the management know and hopefully see a bit of compassion as we have been loyal customers for many years. As days passed, I realized there will be no call back, no follow up, no compassion. So Pizza Hut if you're reading this. Unfortunately I will not be returning, plenty of options as you're aware in the hood to choose from. But will leave you with a piece of advice. Great customer service is the utmost important advantage you can own  over the other guy and cost nothing. How you treat your customers creates loyalty. How you support your own employees is a privelidge to be part of their future success. As a fellow team leader, I'd ask that you take a step back and think about how you will treat the next customer, the opportunity to educate your team member. You never know, could be your car they hit next!"}

{"text":"Lunch \"buffet\" is horrible. Have been there on numerous occasions hoping it would get better but it never does. They are never readily prepared for the lunch rush; with barely any food out or even plates. Horrible; cannot even constitute as a lunch buffet."}
{"text":"This would have been 5 stars but they aren't as consistent as they once were. My order is usually always right..every time I get cheese lovers or extra cheese now a days it's never on there... There's only 1 delivery driver who will come into my apartment building and to my door. The others are for some reason scared and I have to meet them at the sidewalk outside! They tend to get very busy, once was told the delivery time would be 2 hours. Otherwise it's Pizza Hut, tastes the same, same quality."}
{"text":"Due to unfortunate circumstances we were staying at a hotel close to this Pizza Hut. Being in hotel a month we ordered pizza regularly. I would say at least 2-3 times a week we ordered from here. Each and every time our order was delivered with a smiling face, food was always hot, delicious and fast. I never asked for plates forgetting that I had none at hotel. The delivery drivers still made sure they added plates, peppers and cheese. I think they are all amazing."}
{"text":"1st time visit. NEVER AGAIN. Have literally been to dozens of Pizza Huts all over the country. This is hands down THE WORST SERVICE I have ever experienced at ANY pizza place. Pizza was not ready when \"estimated\" and I literally stood there for an additional 25 minutes before I got my pizza. I would have told them to cancel it, but the mgr. had me pay for it first after telling me it would be just another minute and as stated, another 25 mins. later it was done. The phone rang for 5 minutes (not exaggerating) before the mgr. came back out to the counter to answer it. I too, would give this place ZERO stars if I could."}

{"text":"Once again we thought we would give West Charleston Pizza Hut a chance. Hugh mistake! We ordered  one large chicken supreme pizza, one large regular supreme pizza, dessert pizza and BBQ wings. Delivery was the only reason for the one star I did give them, he was courteous and on time. They got the order wrong again, gave us two of the same pizza and both were undercooked.  As I have experienced in the past a phone call to the store is useless, the manager is very short and makes you feel like it is our problem for ordering. Thus we didn't bother, we put the pizzas in the oven to finish cooking and tried the over cooked, dried out wings.  At least some were the other half of the wings were raw by the bone. We threw all of the wings in the trash- not worth getting sick over.
My recommendation, the head office at PH should take a look at their stores and close this one down. Go to Port of Subs next door!"}
{"text":"Ordered a pizza at 7 pm on a Tuesday, almost 2 hours later I got my pizza cold and the breadsticks were as hard as a spoon. 

This Pizza Hut location is disgustingly unprofessional. One hour after not receiving my pizza delivery, I called the restaurant to ask about my pizza order. The employee was shouting at me on the phone saying that they cannot find my pizza order. I asked to speak to the manager, the Indian manager with the thick accent told me that there's a delay in pizza delivery tonight as it is minus 10 degrees outside. The manager said most deliveries are taking over an hour today.

Why the hell the employee didn't tell me my pizza will take 1-2 hours for delivery when I ordered through the phone ?! This location is extremely shady.

Fast forward 1 hour and 40 minutes later, the Pizza Hut delivery guy shows up at my door with the debit machine. I asked him what time is the guarantee time. He said 40 minutes has past since the guarantee time. He stood there with the debit machine shouting at me and refused to give me my pizza which I waited almost 2 hours for. 

Brace yourselves, when we did get the the triple treat box with 2 pizzas, breadsticks and Hershey cookie. Half of it was cold and hard. The breadstick was like steel and the cookie was hard like a rock. The pizza was burnt and still delivered to us.

0 stars for the horrible delivery guy
Negative 10 stars for the rock hard food 
Negative 1000 stars for the Indian manager who is absolutely useless when customers wait 2 hours for their Pizza Hut delivery and they live 1 km away

Stay away from this location and order your pizza somewhere else. You will either not get your pizza or your pizza will be cold and hard."}
{"text":"Just doesn't taste good like Pizza Hut used to. Thank god a couple other pizza places opened up that deliver."}
{"text":"Very poor service. Called in my
Order at 7:15p after taking my order the lady said my order would be here by 8:05p. 8:25p my
Son came to and complained so I decided to call and check on my order. The lady said the wait for delivery was two hours. If communication was a priority maybe that should of been told and I would of just picked up in order instead. Then she comes back on the phone and said my
Order left the store twenty minutes ago and should be there soon. Well another 25
Mins passed and I called them again. She asked a manager about my situation and came back telling me we will give you %20 off. Pizza Hut keep your $2.50 please obviously
You need too train your employees or hire better ones. Then she said it will be 30 more minutes then she put me on hold and said the driver left with my order. It is now 8:50p let's see what time it actually gets here. Sorry but I hate when people bullshit, and sugar coat stuff. just tell the truth it's much better that way."}
{"text":"Pizza taste like shit not fully cook.. and we all got diarrhea afterwards wouldn't recommend anyone to buy pizza from there"}
{"text":"Ordered wings from here in good faith a little while back. I've never been a huge proponent of  Pizza Hut Pizza, as I have always found that the sauce consistency and quantity clashed with the bar of excellence the local Little Caesar's had raised within me in early childhood. But alas, I ordered a small batch of buffalo wings- a product that I would imagine would be a safe bet from any restaurant competent enough to open a Sysco ordering catalog and operate a deep fryer. I was wrong. What arrived at my apartment over an hour later was the most repulsive, ill prepared, attempt of a rendition of buffalo wings I have ever had the unfortunate luck to witness.

Lesson Learned. Spend the extra money and order from Guy's. Or spend less money and go out to the Cuyahoga and eat a mouth full of toxic algae. Either way you'll be more satisfied than if you were to give this Pizza Hut the benefit of the doubt,"}
{"text":"A quick in and out location for me as I order the pizzas before hand for pick up. The service was great didn't have to wait and the pizza were all done as ordered, which is nice!

I like their dough its quite different then other pizza joints. Rest Pizza Hut is a franchise  so much different."}
{"text":"I ordered my pizza at 9:01. Get an email saying it would arrive at 9:56 but I no Pizza Hut takes a while to deliver. At 10:00 I hadn't heard anything yet. At 10:10 when no one had contacted me I decided to call the store. I called 4 times and got no answer so I gave up on that. At 10:19 my pizza showed up. I got a stuffed crust pizza and some garlic bread with cheese and it was TERRIBLE. Of course I could have guessed that would happen since I order it 1 hour and 20 minutes prior. I got an email to fill out a survey but it won't let me fill it out since I wasn't given an actual receipt. Worst pizza I have ever gotten. Likely will not order from there again which sucks cuz I love stuffed crust."}
{"text":"I have to say I was kind of shocked.  Pizza in Ohio is pretty much a joke.  We have tried them all: Guy's, Theresa's, Antonio's, and they are all only slightly better than frozen pizza.

Running out of places to try we ordered delivery from the Pizza Hut in Twinsburg.  We ordered a deep dish pepperoni pie.

35 minutes after ordering the pizza it showed up at the door.  I ate a few pieces and was very pleasantly surprised.  The pizza wasn't greasy and they loaded it up with pepperoni.

Overall, it was pretty darn good and we will be ordering from them moving forward."}
{"text":"THIS PIZZA HUT IS HORRIBLE. I ordered at pizza at 8:19pm.  it said it would b there at 10:05.  okay so at 10:30 I call to see where my pizza is, she tells me that it left the store and is on the way.  30 minutes later I call at 11 and she tells me that the cook left and my pizza isn't coming. what a joke, so now its 11pm and I do not have any dinner and no where else is open"}
{"text":"This review could have easily been a 1 star but because of the professionalism and the customer service I received from Carla, it is now a 5 start review. 

I placed my order this evening and was informed there was a much longer than normal wait time. That was a bit upsetting but I was willing to wait. When I ordered a pan pizza, I was then told that they were out of pan pizzas. Grant it I called at 9:30 pm and it was close to closing time, but with a $10 for any pizza, they should have been prepared and had extra dough prepared. I asked to speak to a manager so I could complain. I was expecting lame excuses and apologies but I was so pleasantly surprised! Carla, the manager on duty, did apologize but she did not try to give me a song and dance. She was honest with me and that goes a long way. She handled my complaint so well that I decided to go ahead and order anyways. She offered me a substantial discount for the trouble that I experienced and for that I am thankful. 

If every manager could learn how to handle customer complaints with the same amount of honesty and understanding as Carla did this evening, the world would be a much better place. A little but of humility and honesty goes a long way and is very much appreciated. Thank you Carla for renewing my faith in customer service."}
{"text":"Sometimes you need to stick up for the restaurant with 1 star reviews. This is just that moment.

I ordered delivery last night, not only was the service fantastic, but so was the pizza. I ordered online, which is so much easier than over the phone. I received an email that said the pizza would be to me within 30 minutes. 

Then...I started reading the yelp reviews and became nervous. So I called pizza hut and asked about my order. They knew exactly which one was mine, said it was in the oven and would be on the way to me as soon as it came out.

10 minutes before the estimated delivery time my phone rang and the delivery person said he was outside. I signed the receipt and he handed me a pizza that looked like it came from a fancy restaurant. He was well spoken and seemingly very happy to see how excited I was to get my pizza.

Writing this review almost wants to make me order another one, but if I do I will get fat and that is no good. But if I had listened to all the one star reviews I would have missed out. Don't miss out, these guys are good. Do the right thing and order from Pizza Hut because Harry B says so..."}
{"text":"Constant problems with this location. I like pizza hut, but not this location and unfortunately it's the only one that can deliver to me. Occasionally they get it right (and when they do it's REALLY GOOD) but most of the time.. problems. Today the pizza was over an hour late and arrived completely cold. When I called and asked where it was they told me it was \"on the way.\" It took additional 45 minutes AFTER HE SAID IT WAS ON THE WAY. Even getting anyone to answer the phone was nearly impossible! Absolute worst customer service. Done. done. done. done."}
{"text":"Walked in at 9:40pm to order a 14pc crispy bone-in wings with honey bbq and a large hawaiian/peperoni pizza. As I completed my order I noticed someone sitting in the corner waiting for their order, person #1, and someone walking into the restaurant to pick-up an order, person #2.

I waited outside for 23 minutes as I was quoted 15-20 minutes. I walked inside the restaurant and noticed person #1 and #2 still waiting, but person #2 was at the cashier table. Person #2 seemed unhappy as the order of wings was incorrect. The manager came out and issued a discount, person #2 paid and left. Person #1 finally got their order and was given a liter of Sierra Mist for waiting then left.

I was asked for my name when the cashier noticed me. She pulled out the pizza I had ordered and looked confused as I continued to wait so I asked for my wings. She ran to the back and asked that I wait 4 minutes as they completed my order.

As I continue to wait another person walked into the restaurant, person #3, and receives their pizza. At the same time one of the cooks came out and converses with person #3. The cook asks the cashier if she was 'really' going to make them pay for it. Person #3 was eventually given a discount for whatever reason as I continued to wait, person #3 left.

My order of wings finally came out but it was incorrect, 8pc bone-in mild? The cashier returned to the kitchen and asked If I'd like a liter of Sierra Mist. Instead I asked for the manager which took some time too. I demanded a refund of my money because I had to wait up to 40 minutes for an incomplete order. The manager didn't hesitate, but she asked the cashier for her 'tail' after this. I did not need to know how the cashier was going to be disciplined which I thought was very unprofessional. I walked out and went to another restaurant next door, 20 paces away, got my food in less than 9 minutes!

Not the cashiers, nor cook's fault. Simply no management, the place is pretty much being runned by the teenage employees."}
{"text":"I picked up pizza for my family, but with Celiac Disease, I can not eat gluten. Some Pizza Hut locations have gluten-free pizza (none nearby), so I asked the manager if this location could please have gluten free. He told me that it's all in my head. He has NEVER felt the excruciating pain of gluten on a gluten intolerant system and I have NEVER been so insulted by customer \"service.\" What an ignorant tool. I'll never order here again. Learn some people skills or take some medical classes before you start giving diagnoses, Moron."}
{"text":"I have to say the only reason I am giving this place 4 stars is because of one of the delivery drivers that work here. I still don't know his name but I will update it when I find out because I've never had a delivery guy that is as friendly and helpful as this guy. I enjoy the mild hot wings and cinnamon sticks here and order them a lot. The driver knew my name after a couple of times and always gives me coupons and info on the best deals so I can save money. I thought that was very nice of him and he deserves to be recognized for going above his job to make his customers happy."}
{"text":"We've eaten here for years. It has never been great, but it is getting worse by the week. Tonight they were out of wings. Salad bar sucks....they don't even have cucumbers or carrots anymore.  And if you want a drink refill, you'd better pack an ice chest, because the ditzy waitress sure won't do it. 

We won't be back."}
{"text":"Phone in pick up order on a Saturday night. They said it would be ready in 15 minutes and it was!

The pizza looks great. Smells amazing. Lots of cheese and toppings. Very hot even after 6 min drive home. 

We ordered ham and pineapple and a Canadian. Both pizzas are delicious. Not greasy. Crust is soft and perfect.  Boneless bites chicken honey BBQ is good. Kids loved them. 

Definitely worth our money and happy to order again."}
{"text":"The thin crust pizza is always good and is always what we get but never try the Serracha chicken. After eating a bite of it it burns your mouth so much that you spend the next three hours in agony. Whoever is in the kitchen making the sauce needs to reformulate.   Because we eat level 10 Thai food at least three times a week.  And this stuff ruined our whole dinner.  Had to throw the chicken away."}
{"text":"No wonder they get bad reviews! This place really is horrible when it comes to customer service. 

I decided to give it a try regardless of the past reviews, because it's closest to the house. The lady that rung me up, was decent. When I went back to pick up my order, I stood in the counter for a good 10 minutes waiting for someone. When one of the guys finally appeared, he asked for my receipt, which he has a copy of taped on top of the box, had the nerve to ask me if I paid for it already. 

I had to get my purse from my truck, gave him my receipt, which he didn't look at anyways, and gave me the box.

WHAT A TOTAL WASTE OF MY TIME!!

DO YOUR JOB PEOPLE!!! Look at the receipt and give a better customer service next time!!"}
{"text":"Worst place... called ahead and ordered my pizza still wasn't ready waited 15 minutes at the location and they still gave me the wrong pizza!! Manager did nothing to rectify the situation! I asked for my refund and left!"}
{"text":"Last time we'll be ordering from here. Pizza was luke warm at best, wings tasted awful and had no sauce, I literally had to take hot sauce from home and re-toss the wings. We asked for the brownie and they brought us the cookie that looked like a 5 year old attempted to cut it. The pizza was barely cut as well. Had to take our pizza cutter at home to cut it. Not to mention, the update said the pizza was leaving Pizza Hut around 9:15 and it was delivered after 10 pm. NEVER AGAIN. This Pizza Hut is HORRIBLE. Surprised Pizza Hut management does not pay attention to how awful this location's reviews are. Or maybe they simply don't care."}
{"text":"I would give this 0 stars if I could. I ordered a dinner box tonight and just came down with food poisoning a few hours later. DO NOT GO HERE!"}
{"text":"My Carry-out experience

So, I guess they think Customer Service was something that did not need to be offered.
Hmmm... Let's start with...

Not being thanked for my purchase, 
They tok for ever, 15 min turned into 25... and translates into eternity with hungry kids...
Cheese pizza was to toasty for my taste..(kids didn't mind)
When gathering my 3 pizzas they put my wings on top, 
I had to ask for a bag to put the wings in & then , I had to ask for napkins...and of course, I wanted cheese & crushed peppers...

While writing this I feel a bit picky BUT, after all I've already paid & these are things they offer for free Right????

Immediately leaving I had my review in mind..
I'm sure I will return, after all $5.99 pizza is a good deal..."}
{"text":"If I could give this location a minus star,  I would. We recently ordered a large pizza with boneless parmesan wings and it was barely edible. The pizza was obviously burned and tasted a day old.  I took one bite of the wing and the consistency was nauseating. It didn't taste like chicken at all. This store is so rundown and the customer service leaves a lot to be desired. We won't be returning."}
{"text":"The new edge pizza is a stinker, at least the one we got from Bridgeville.  First it had regular size crust ( not to the edge )  and it was like a big saltine cracker, secondly it was burnt, and lastly if by edge they mean extremely salty then they would be on target.  We were up all night drinking water.  Granted we ordered a pepperoni, which is usually salty, but you needed a 2 liter bottle to just to get thru a couple of pieces.
We also got a regular hand tossed, but this was also a disappointment because we wanted the whole grain \"natural crust\" but they were out of 
that.







Does not warrant a return visit
Does not warrant a return visit."}
{"text":"I'm a regular here and although this location is a bit older the service is good and the food is always great."}
{"text":"Don't bother. Most the reviews are negative for a reason. Called in an order and first off they no longer make some items on their menu. The guy took my number and address down. I had to repeat my credit card number at least 3 times before he got it right. That should have been my warning sign. The guy said it would be delivered around 6:50. Well around 7:30 I finally decided to give them a call. I explained I had made an order and i was calling to check up on it. They asked for my name and put me on hold for about 3-4 mins then someone comes on the line. Apparently they took down the wrong address. When they tried to call me they found out that they apparently took down the wrong phone number... The girl said sorry and that they would make me another one and deliver it. Its been over an hour and they cant even offer up a free pizza or drink or bread sticks. Anything?!?!?  I told them i was good and no longer wanted anything from their establishment."}
{"text":"I have never sat down at this location, so I can't comment on the service, but I've ordered delivery at least a dozen times. Only one time was I disappointed and it wasn't enough to warrant a call in.

The pizza is always hot and fresh. For a long time I was against ordering from Pizza Hut because the quality was lacking, but I do have to say they have stepped up their game. It's not the hardiest pizza, but definitely flavorful and worth the cost.

Not the place to order dessert (I've tried it a few times and it is usually dry, compared to the juicy-looking commercial ads) and the wings are rather small. But if you're looking for a low-effort solution for dinner, consider this a suitable option."}
{"text":"I don't usually rate anything or make any attempts to change people's perception of any establishment, regardless if the experience was good or terrible.  That said, this place was atrocious enough to provoke me to take time out of my busy day to share my experience.  

To start, one of the staff swiftly stole my spot when I was clearly backing into it.  When confronted, he called me a \"f*cking a*shole\" and proceeded to walk away.

Once in the store, he continued to accuse me of passing the spot without any indication that I was going to park in the spot.  Regardless of what happened in the parking lot, this is not how you treat your customers.  It was not the most pleasant experience, and were it not for the kids party I was having, I would have walked away and left the employee to pay for it out of his own pocket.  

To add insult to injury, there were hairs inside one of the two pizza's hidden underneath the cheese and in the sauce.  They resembled pubic hairs, but you never know if the chef has super curly hair.  Either way, the experience was terrible and food containing curly, pubic looking, hair is not what you want to be serving to your guests, let alone the fact that they are kids.  Regrettably I did not take any pictures of the hair in the food, as I was busy looking after the kids.  

If you come here, be warned that there are other better, more cleanly, and dignified ways to purchase pizza.  Other places will serve pizza that is exponentially better in quality, and will treat you with the respect that any person deserves.

This place would receive a negative rating if Yelp would allow."}
{"text":"Ordered I pizza and 16 wings and took an hour and half to be delivered.  When it got here the food was cold.  I used my digital food thermometer and the wings were 83 degrees and the pizza was 85.  I called the store asking for a  refund and after waiting for a manager for several minutes (while I could hear the employees discussing who I was since they only set the phone down and not on \"hold\"). The \"manager\" that finally answered sounded young and like he didn't care.  He first offered to send another order. I declined since I wasn't that impressed with the food as it was and definitely didn't need that much pizza and wings and also didn't want a driver to have to waste gas.  He asked for my number several times and suggested that I ordered my food from another store when he couldn't find me (when I know that's the store I ordered from since it was on my receipt) and after assuring him that it was my number I suggested that he look up my order another way. He finally did and said he'd put a credit on my account with them to be used in three months.  I told him that's not what I wanted or asked for especially since we hardly ever order pizza - especially from them.  After going back and forth he finally refunded my card but not without some attitude from him. I hardly ever order from Pizza Hut.  I only did because I wanted wings and couldn't think of anyplace nearby that delivered.  Now I remember why I don't."}
{"text":"Only ordered Pizza Hut for the nostalgia of the breadsticks. Order took over 2 hours to be delivered. When it arrived, delivery guy had only pizza, no breadsticks. Manager could care less. 

Nobody out pizzas the hut."}
{"text":"Very clean restaurant, well managed with excellent employees.  Every order has been perfect and ready when claimed it would be.  Very well done!"}
{"text":"Is zero stars an option?

Delivery took over an hour and a half. When the pizza arrived it was cold."}
{"text":"Well...... This pizza was quite bad. BLEH!!! The toppings weren't bad, however the crust was like cardboard!! REALLY, REALLY TERRIBLE....
     Don't waste your time, appetite or money."}
{"text":"I am still reeling over the fact that my pizza was delivered 10 mins late and cold. And they did not offer any coupons or discounts for delivering it late. Luckily, I do not mind cold pizza, but my better half does. Come on PH... you can do better!"}
{"text":"Welcome to the worst Pizza Hut in the valley.  I've had 3 different orders sent to me with drastically undercooked pizzas.  I called to complain once and all I got was a manager trying to explain that it's impossible to under cook the pizza cause their oven is always at a set temp.  I get it, but that doesn't mean everything is thoroughly cooked.  They are pulling them off the conveyer belt earlier for convenience.  The best part is, they won't refund your money either.... cause.... everyone loves a local thief.  

This place needs some type of adult supervision since it is clearly lacking.  Food is truly gross, and nobody working there cares.  Where's corporate?  I'm sure they'll care when someone gets sick from eating uncooked pizza dough.  Gross!!!!"}
{"text":"If I could give them negative 5 stars I would. I go here once or twice a month with my kids. It's for them. Otherwise, I'd stop all-together. The wait-staff haven't changed at all but it always seems like its their first day. Delays in everything from sitting down, the getting drinks (even when its empty), getting food out in a reasonable time, waiting for a check, waiting to pay someone. VERY white trash.

If you are into Monster Energy drinks, mullets, and waiting around for a long time for something underwhelming, this is your place!"}
{"text":"The most disgraceful service I've ever had at a Pizza Hut. Rude employees. More than an hour for delivery. Avoid if you can."}
{"text":"Pizza is ok, nothing expectacular, exactly what you would expect from a large chain. But, what downgrades pizza Hut is the HIGH prices. And to add insult to injury, they charge for sauces, even when you buy wings!!! I will never eat at any Pizza Hut again."}
{"text":"Pizza Hut has all these commercials advertising there ads & when I go online to put in a order takes about 1 hour & 30mins to arrive to my house & as the delivery man knocks on my door I go to open up my pizza boxes .... DRY & COLD !!! UNACCEPTABLE!!!!! I had to use my own gas to drive to the store myself & pick up a whole new order !!!! I chose delivery for a reason !!!! Disappointed, from now on I will be going to Little Cesar's pizza ."}
{"text":"We order pizza from here 3-4 times a month and have it delivered. Always delivered within 30-40 minutes. We have never had an incorrect order either. Keep up the great work Pizza Hut!!"}
{"text":"I have been to this location twice for lunch for their lunch buffet. I love their buffet and you can stuff your with carbs.

The buffet is decent they have couple types of pizza, pasta, Green & Greek salad, sticks and Dessert pizza which I love.

The server we had both time was the same and she didn't seemed happy and was angry when we asked for separate bills. She was the only working their but that would have been understandable if the restaurant was busy. 

It would have been a 3 star if it wasn't was the bad service twice."}
{"text":"Even though the website is having issues with ordering chicken, the guys are doing a great job.  The solid guy at the location was aware of the situation.  Even though corporate needs to give them more staff, they were kind, understanding, and professional.  The driver did a great job keeping my receipt and taking it to location, the pro working there showed me the situation and pointed out it's a tech support issue, and even though it took longer, it seemed like a supervisor came with my reshipment of chicken to make sure it was good.  Best thin crust pizza I've had in a long time.  Minor technical difficulty over ordering chicken from the website (which, remember, has nothing to do with this store), a great on floor worker, a great set of trainee delivery staff.  It was all great, just please be patient with a skeleton crew and website issues.  The staff at this location is GREAT.  Corporate just needs to give them an extra body in the kitchen and a designated receptionist to answer all the unlv college folks ordering from them.  You guys are seriously good and patient, it was a great experience!  Still our favorite pizza, even better than it was before."}
{"text":"Ok, second time to this location and second and last chance.

First time the pizza was undercooked and they didn't even compensate one bit.  It was mushy inside the though wasn't cooked properly.

Now this time, it's overcooked and the pepperoni is burnt crispy.

Won't be returning to this location again though Pizza Hut in general has good pizza -- usually it's pricier than other so look for one of their deals."}
{"text":"Tonight we placed an order online. We normally don't have issues with this particular location, so I'm kind of bummed this happened. We ordered 2 pizzas. They were both wrong. Missing marinara sauce, the extra orders of veggies we requested, and how one of them was supposed to be thin crust. My husband called them back and told them the issues, they were willing to remake them, but our kids had already started eating by then. The lady said she would call us back and try to credit us. We still have yet to hear back. Definite thumbs down."}
{"text":"Check your order before you leave. Ordered bread sticks but they forgot to give me the marinara sauce. Called the store, they asked me to come back after I just drove home. 

I asked for a raincheck and they said they can give me a dollar off next time. 

Try to eat bread sticks without the sauces... I will give you a dollar"}
{"text":"This location is HORRIBLE. My husband and I moved into the area about a year and a half ago and have maybe ordered 3 times. Every time they screw something up. Last time it was soooo bad and I ended up getting a $7 credit. Needless to say I was going to use that credit. I had to call and place the order, which I hate because I want a poet record of what I KNOW I ordered. 

Anyhow today's order was just as awful as the last time. I ordered extra sauce and hut crust on my pizza and did not receive either. The pizza was barely warm like it has been sitting there. My order was supposed to come with two marinara sauces and I PAID for two extras and they shorted me one.

The driver also forgot my pop. At least he went to get it but he was so slow. 

All in all I didn't even bother calling because there's nothing they can do to make me want to come back. We tried and are now done. Thank god for all the other many options around us."}
{"text":"Worst phone experience ever had. If ignorance was a virtue. These people would be tops. I had to spell everything out to them!"}
{"text":"We placed an order at just before 7pm yesterday. The delivery time was promised to be at 8:14pm. I did not get the email that they had begun preparing until 8:30pm - they had only begun preparing the pizza AFTER the promised delivery time. We called customer service to cancel the order as it was unacceptable for service to be this slow and we had guests over so we were going to buy some other food. However, after repeated calls to both the specific location (which led to a general line anyway) and the toll free number, the call did not go through. When it finally did go through, customer service said we could not cancel so when the food arrives, she said it would be given to us free of charge. When the pizza finally arrived PAST 9pm, the delivery man called customer service to confirm that the pizza should be free and customer service said no, despite telling us that it WOULD be free half an hour before. So we did not take the pizza. This has been one of the worst customer service experiences we've ever experienced for 2 reasons - unacceptably slow delivery and customer representatives who lie to get us off the phone."}
{"text":"Hands down the best pizza hut I've been to.
The pizza is 4 times better when you sit down and eat. Maybe the grease takes on a different quality when served so quickly."}
{"text":"Quality of pizza was about Pizza Hut standard so pretty good. Waiting time was about 20 minutes so not terrible but not great.  Employees were robotic and not personable but efficient. Few good choices at a reasonable price in the casinos. Warning at peak hours this could be a long bad wait."}
{"text":"Just had my pizza delivered by the best delivery man ever. He was very polite and had a cute smile. If he keeps that up I will have to see if he's on the menu. Thanks for the great service Bill. See you next time."}
{"text":"Surprised, but it actually was good ... yes, Pizza Hut and good. At least at 10:30AM, this is the place to be!"}
{"text":"I love ordering from this location. It's on the corner or Fort Apache and Sahara. My pizza always arrives before I'm expecting it to. The pizza is consistent in flavor as well. I recommend ordering online to get the best deals! If you don't want to have it delivered, go pick it up... There's never a line."}
{"text":"What a joke. I ordered from here today. They got all my information. They tell me it's going to be 30-40 minutes for delivery. I'm staying at the hotel next door. I call an hour later and some guy Mike that answered the phone tells me there is no record of my order. Even though it sounded like the person that took my order. This place is s joke. Save yourself the trouble and order from somewhere else."}
{"text":"Wow! My pizza showed up so burnt that it's hard and my child can't even eat it. I'm super excited to pay good money for burnt food. My cheese sticks are so burnt you can see the brown burnt cheese on top. I'm glad you saw my order was burnt and decided to send it to me anyways. That's awesome customer service."}
{"text":"Unfortunately the app does not allow me to select another Pizza Hut which is beyond frustrating so I'm stuck with this one here. Seems like time and time again they never fail to surprise me( not in a good way either)if it's not one thing it's something else. I stopped ordering for about 3-4 months and nothing has changed. I guess I'll keep wishing."}
{"text":"My husband and I occasionally order takeout from this location, and it's been great.  This time, we decided to get out of the house and try their lunch buffet.  It was reasonably priced, and the location wasn't far from home.

Big mistake.  We made it there just fine, but when we sat down to eat, yuck.  They had four different pizzas that you could choose from; the pizzas were under a heating lamp, and you could tell that immediately.  They looked like they had been out for quite sometime.  When you look at pizza, there should be some glossiness to it, which signifies the ingredients have been freshly cooked and the oils are still simmering.  This pizza looked plastic--and it tasted every bit of it.

I got past a couple slices; after that, I gave up and considered it a waste of my 8.00.  My husband loves pizza, so he didn't mind so much that it was old, but he still wasn't thrilled with the experience, either.

Is this a deal-breaker for me?  No.  I'll continue to order when we want pizza.  I'll just stick with takeout; they do a stellar job on that."}
{"text":"I had  to write a review for pizza hut, this place I give not even a star
Me and my bob were craving some late night snack, so we decided to do pizza hut. My bob was wanting there buffalo wings, they looked so good on ther website. So we ordered some. Only$ 6.99 for 8 piece which is not bad,(plus the delivery fee is$ 3.50) so we just got those. 
I called them up and they guy picked up the phone, his name was jo, he sounded he wasn't even on earth when I was talking to him, I had to keep on repeating my order. Finally about the 3rd time I told him my order he said it will be here about 35 to 40 min. I thought it was kinda long for wings but I said ok. 
55 min later, I still haven't heard anything so I called Jo up again and I asked, what is keeping our order, he said wait just a little bit longer, it should be there, wait another 15 min, if he is not there, call us back. So I said ok, waited for actually 20 min, still nothing, so I called him back, I kept my cool and I asked what is going on, he said what is the address again I told him again, than he handed the phone to his manager, I talked to her and she told us that they called us couple times to let us know that we were at the house couple of times for our wings, I stood right by our door the whole time I didn't get any knock or anything. She got a  little bit pissy at me and said well, we will make a new batch, except us in 5 min, I said ok, I walked outside with my computer and waited, they were here in less that 4 min when I got off the phone.
The delivery guy told us he was sorry about all the trouble. Than he started asking us all kinds of questions about our living situation which was not perfectionall at all. 
I didn't really answer him, he was nice though. 
As I walked in the house and looked at the order, it was the wrong order, he they gave us boneless buffalo wings. I went threw all that for them to give me the wrong order, I will NOT be ordering from this pizza hut again, they are others around our area that I will try. I wish you luck at this pizza hut. 

But at the end I just learned to put on a happy face and just the enjoy the wrong order we got, the buffalo boneless was not bad, (there sauce was watery but good). was the same price."}
{"text":"If I could, I would give this place no rating at all.  I placed my order at 7:35PM on a Monday and when I received the email, it said the \"possible\" time it would be delivered would be 9:26 at night (which I find ridiculous to begin with).  So an hour goes by, I think okay I'll just call and see what time they can quote me for.  The girl that answered the phone didn't seem she had a clue about when it'd be done and said \"ummm it should be there within a half an hour.\"  I said ok, and when another 45 minutes went by, I was starting to get really irritated.  I waited until 10 minutes PAST the time they said it would be delivered, which again mind you was 2 hours.  I called at 9:36 at night and said \"Hi, I placed an hour two hours ago and I still have not received my pizza and if the delivery driver has not left, I want to cancel my order.\"  The girl that answered the phone said ok what is your number and said ok i'll cancel your order.  I said how does it take 2 hours to make a pizza.  The girl said \"ma'am it doesn't take 2 hours, your order wasn't supposed to be ready until 9:26\"  I said yes and it's 10 minutes past that.  she goes well the driver didn't leave until 9:05.  I said okay, well this is ridiculous, I live 3 miles away it doesn't take a half an hour to get here and you will no longer be getting my business.  The girl seemed to have snickered almost and I hung up the phone.   The customer service was horrible.  Even on the busiest of days, I have never had to wait 2 hours for a pizza, let alone on a boring Monday night.  It's a shame to me because I love pizza hut over any other pizza place and I now have to go out of my way to get it because there is no way I will be going to that Pizza hut again."}
{"text":"Wait--no salad in a pizza restaurant?? No silverware? Well, the pizza was pretty good, but I won't be back...too much competition."}
{"text":"Went here for the lunch buffet, which was only available for a short duration during summer I believe.

It was not too expensive however there is not much to choose from, only four types of pizza were provided along with a salad bar. The salad bar was very small and only had one dressing, and the only vegetable was Roman lettuce.

The pizza tasted alright, albeit it boggles me that they put hot-dog sausages in their crust, which were very dry and tasteless.

Their ice cream machine didn't work :("}
{"text":"Their stuffed crust pizza was horrible and it made me sick so sad that the pizza I love the most anit that good anymore"}
{"text":"Never ordering from this location again. Terrible experience. Delivery driver showed up 30 minutes late and the pizza was completely cold. Didn't have a microwave in the hotel room to warm up the pizza unfortunately.

Still tipped over 18% even though the driver wasn't the best. He didn't have paper plates and red pepper/parmesan packets on hand like how all pizza delivery drivers should. Also he didn't even deliver to our door. He called me to come pick it up outside! What kind of service is that? Pizza always get delivered directly to our hotel door. Room number was provided and everything.

Called the location to make a complaint and nothing could be done to be compensated unless if I wanted to wait another 2 and half hours for another pizza. No thanks. I'd rather just eat pizza cold at that point."}
{"text":"The Pizza is pretty good in comparison to other fast food pizza places. The girl that answers was very nice. She deserves five stars."}
{"text":"Ordered pizza for the first time from there and never again. I should've read the reviews first. I've been waiting almost 2 hours for a pizza delivery. They claim they only have one driver and whether  that is true or not (seems to be a trend based on reviews) it's unacceptable. At least don't lie and quote 25-35 minutes. The manager crystal was extremely rude on the phone and practically yelled at me for being upset about the wait time. She was very unprofessional. I will never order from here or any Pizza Hut again and don't recommend anyone else to either. I'll just stick to GOOD pizza from pizzerias. I could've bought and cooked a meal in the time it's taking the delivery. Horrible customer service overall. I'm sure the pizza probably won't even be hot when it gets here."}
{"text":"They could never get my order right. Even after I would call the manager, they would still keep messing up my order. Last time we went I had to wait an additional 30-40 minutes after the due time. Pizza was always rubbery and never cut right. Never going back to Pizza Hut. Customer service is a joke."}
{"text":"I called to order a delivery & as soon as I gave the kid my address he says, \"uhh we don't deliver there anymore.\" Then hangs up immediately. I work in customer service & that is not how you treat paying customers. What if I wanted to switch it to a pick up. It should be part of their job to suggest switching to pick up or give other options of locations that may deliver to my location. He should not be taking phone orders & stick to the kitchen. Actually, with that attitude I wouldn't want him touching my food either."}
{"text":"Ordered for the first time online.  Everything was great and arrived hot and fresh.  I got off the $5 deal menu.  Loved the anchovies,  yes I'm weird,  but they weren't overwhelming like some places I won't mention.  And also I love the white sauce!  Best I've had from a chain pizza place - creamy,  garlicky,  and parmeseany!"}
{"text":"I just ordered the triple treat for 20 bucks and it looks like a triple mess. I can count the 7 pieces of pepperoni and the pan crust is more like thin crust. The hour that it took to deliver I could've walked to the store and both the microwave pizzas that look like the pizza they delivered. This treat was more like a trick. I always order from this pizza Hut but it looks like I'll be more on team Domino....So after I decided to call and spoke with the manager Douglas. He was great to remake our pizza order and threw in a 2 liter. This was a good recovery from what could've been a horrible pizza experience. I thanked him and appreciated his good customer service."}
{"text":"Wish I could give negative stars! This place was disgusting. Flys all over the place, and the pizza was as dry as California in 2015."}
{"text":"These guys do not give a damn. Literally watching this guy day dream while staring at the phone ringing. I few bad for the owner."}
{"text":"Pizza came in 50 minutes, not 30 like site said - however, I didn't expect 30 minute delivery time (never happens?).

Got a medium meat pizza, thin and crispy, and a pepperoni marg pizza, also thin and crispy, both with extra sauce.  Both were good.  

Was surprised by driver when I paid with visa.  Tip option was 15, 20, 25%.  Maybe it's just me, but do we really start with 15% tip for delivery now?

I'd probably do again.  Ordered two pop & two dip with it.   

$45 (before tip).  Seem pricy to you?  Seems pricy to me."}
{"text":"Nope not going to order from this Pizza Hut again . Wish there was a good pizza place around. Burn those cheese sticks . The pizza is pineapple and bacon . Or just pineapple nice cut job too guys . You really didn't want to work today ."}
{"text":"TERRIBLE service. Arguing employees behind the counter. Not informing customers about current promotions and charging them full prices. Screwing up customer orders and not taking accountability. Long line out the door. I'd rather microwave a pizza than deal with this place again."}
{"text":"Love this place! Great for family dinners out! It's never very busy when we are there, but the pizza is good and now they have wings! Bonus!!!"}
{"text":"I had not been to this Pizza Hut in several years because my last experience gave me no reason to return.  However, my daughter was awarded a certificate for a free personal pan pizza and asked if we could go. After this experience,  I will never eat there again. First, the salad bar was lousy, the ingredients didn't taste fresh and the dressing I selected was a mystery.  Second, my daughter had grease all over her hands from her pizza, which wasn't so good to begin with.  But the worst part was my chicken fettuccine alfredo.  It was mostly fake tasting, sloppy, and soupy.  The chicken was borderline spoiled. I mentioned this to the waiter and asked him to tell the manager, which he did. When I received my bill I noticed I was still charged for the chicken alfredo.  When I took my bill up to the counter I again complained to the manager my meal was not good and the chicken tasted spoiled.  He simply replied \"sorry about that, it was a fresh bag of chicken\".  Because I am not one to make a scene, and we had already received part of our meal for free, I just quietly paid and shook my head as I left. I do not recommend this restaurant.  I am shocked they are still in business."}
{"text":"This is by far the worse Pizza Hut I have ever had the displeasure of ordering from. First off, don't falsely advertise that you are open until 11:00 and the call your customer 30 minutes before 11 , telling them delivery is not available. This has happened to me multiple times. If your drivers do not want to stay an entire shift then announce delivery is until 10 or 10:30. This is terrible customer service. There is also constant issues with online orders and repeated technical difficulties and the only real discounts receivable are online. If the occurs then the stores should have call in discounts when the website is down. I have called both the store and customer service to express my concerns and multiple times wound up speaking with someone who sounds stoned to no end or a rep or manager who talks in circles offering no solution. I have also had my card charged 3 times while saying my order was never placed and a agin no offer made to compensate the inconvenience. My last order also placed the pizza was cold and looked like it was tossed around on a roller coaster. Tonight will be the last order I ever place with this company. I order from here once every 1 to 2 weeks and every time there is an issue. I also work in the customer service/F&B industry and am very understanding to mistakes but this place is out of control. Definitely fed up with this place."}
{"text":"I just placed an order online for dinner and to give Pizza Hut my business you know it's funny that pizza won't wouldn't accept my payment what a complete joke. 

I will for sure take my business some where else."}
{"text":"This pizza hut is old and grimy! It needs a facelift super bad. The inside smells and is very dark and gloomy.
My food was like any other pizza hut so I'm not going to give them 1 star based on appearance but I'll drive the extra 10 minutes to rocky river and just carry out."}
{"text":"The first time we ordered here our order was extremely late, so they gave us a free coupon for a free pizza next time we came.  Next experience was fine.  The one after that the pizzas looked terrible and the person who handed them to me looked at them, acted like they were fine and spoke to me like he dropped out of school after 2nd grade.  The next time we ordered pizza from them it was 45 minutes late with no apology and the pizza was cold.  I posted a complaint on their website and never heard anything.  We will not be ordering from here again."}
{"text":"Clean your checkout area... most disgusting keyboard I have ever seen. This is a bad sign for the cleanliness of the food you serve. 

This place has food poisoning written all over it."}
{"text":"Ordered a big pizza box deal online, the order said 35 minutes wait on delivery, we ordered at 8:20. Since I live an an Appartment complex I put in the special instructions for me to meet the car at the call box up front, 40 minutes later I go down to the call box to wait for pizza guy because I realized he/she did not have the time to wait for me at the gate. 5 minutes of waiting in the cold I give them a call and the said \"they should be here within the next 5 minutes if not we'll get credit on our order\". 5 minutes more we give them a call and they said the pizza is leaving now (mind you I only live 4 minutes away). After waiting 20 minutes out in the cold my sister calls me at 9:20 and says the delivery guy is at the door, which means he drove right past me on the way into the gates(I guess he got lucky that they're was a resident driving in front of him while entering the complex). Driver had no sign on his car and we did not get credit on that order. The pizza and breadsticks were cold and stale. Definitely will never order from here again. I would have been completely fine if I was told 1 hour wait as long as it arrived around the time they gave, also if the pizza was at least hot. Pizza on rainbow sucks don't order delivery ever from they're, from reading other reviews it seems delivery is the main problem so I can't see why this problem isn't fixed yet, I would give 0 stars if I could."}
{"text":"Order three medium pizza- 2 deep dish and one thin crust.  The pizzas where ready very fast and it tasted quite good.  Will buy from this pizza hut again in the future."}
{"text":"What can I say it's pizza hut pizza.  I wouldnt eat inside because it's not very restaurant like but the pizza wasn't bad
and neither were the boneless chicken. The pizza was ready when I went to pick it up and it was hot it's OK there are other better pizza places around but this was sufficient"}
{"text":"I literally received the worst service I have ever received from any establishment. I placed an online order at 8:17 pm. Got an email and text confirmation to track the order. Online it said it would take between 40-55 min , cool ! 9:17 hits and I get a text saying it's out for delivery. YAY !! At 9:55 still no pizza, so I call to check on the Order. After speaking with the first worker I was told my order wasn't online for carry out or delivery..(weird, since I already received two verifications on my order) the worker then placed me on hold. When they took me off I was speaking with a new female worker. Hoping she would be of more assistance I explained my problem. She told me that the delivery driver came to my building, got in using the gate code, and knocked on my door 4 times before leaving and arriving back at the store. I asked why didn't she call? She repeated a number back that wasn't mine. I corrected her and she said \"well that's not the number you entered\" how? If I got the text confirmation? Also if she entered the gate code, which btw isn't a gate, it's a door.. the number would've called directly to my phone for me to buzz her up. They persisted that it wasn't their fault. Tired of discussing my order, I said I was coming to pick it up. My encounter at the store was much like the service I received over the phone. Not a great experience."}
{"text":"I don't know any words other than unpleasant, unprofessional, and shameful for this particular store. I usually place my order and do a carry out since they are directly across the street from my residence. The one time I decide to do a delivery.....my order came to $41.70 and my order wasn't even right. Not only did I wait 1 complete hour but my pizza's were cold, the toppings were missing, and I had to scrap the pizza off the box. I called to let them know about this unfortunate event,  I was put on hold without being told to hold on then the Manager David or Dave who picked up the phone was extremely rude and said that's how pizza's are when they are delivered because the have to sit in a bag, I said no they're supposed to be fresh and I'm right across the street why would they come out the oven to a bag in a car and be delivered across the street 1 hour later. He said he would credit me one pizza off my order but not 2. I spent all that money with them just to get their ass to kiss when they messed up, they didn't even credit my account. I believe he just said that to get me off the phone. Worse experience in the world. I wish I would've never gave them my hard earned money. I know better next time to shop with another pizza parlor or a Pizza Hut down the road. At least I know their customer service will be exceptional and I will have fresh pizza and everything I paid for and the manager won't be rude and unprofessional. Shame on this Pizza Hut!"}
{"text":"Ordered food for some reason they needed to call to confirm address even though i have been at same address for 9 years... then for some reason my old number is on file even though they have called my new number for the last 2 years when they need gate code.... what a joke very irritating then again now i wont have pizza hut  so i will win save money and eat less crap"}
{"text":"I've ordered a few times from here, had decent service, last night my card was charged, I received a confirmation of the arrival time, my phone number is accurate, when my order didn't arrive I called, they were closed, I spoke to a lady from after hours she said it was on delivery. Today I called because it never arrived, they lack in customer service, but expected from kids running the place, definitely a reflection of the lack of leadership, disappointed, it's just pizza, and they can't get it right. Now I wait for my refund.."}
{"text":"I have pizza night with my children once every other week. The last two times I placed an order my pizza was never delivered. I never received a call or explanation. I waited almost 2 hours. It is now 10 pm and my kids never got their pizza."}
{"text":"Absolute worst service I've ever experienced. We ordered a couple of pizzas from them at 9:30pm tonight and pre-paid over the phone. It has now been 2 and a half hours and they have not shown up and every time we've called we get placed on an automated hold which hangs up after 10 minutes."}
{"text":"Fast service,  great food, die hard Pizza Hut lover, but common guys, please go coast to coast with the toppings not 85% of the way :("}
{"text":"This Pizza Hut has never disappointed us. Sure, \"it's just Pizza Hut,\" you may say... what's the big deal? 

This Pizza Hut makes their pizzas the way I remember Pizza Hut making their pizzas when I was a kid... perfect amount of cheese and pepperonis cooked to an ALMOST crispness so that when you bite into the pizza there's that slight crunch before you get to the soft dough. 

And they arrive that way after being delivered!

Most of the other Pizza Huts I've been to over the years have hardly mastered that in store...forget delivery! And all of our delivery persons have been so stellar! I can always hear the one driver \"It's Pizza Time!\" whenever we have a pizza night. 

We've never had any major order discrepancies and the one time that we did, they had really great customer service about the problem and were quick to take care of us. 

What it all boils down to is this: the pies are always fresh and delicious and the people are consistently awesome.

As Todd J. says: \"Best Pizza Hut on the planet, G!\""}
{"text":"Agree on worst location. The tables are dirty, it's stainless so should be easy to clean but there are stains all around. The pizza came out uncooked after waiting for more than 25mins, I also asked for a hot sauce and it cost .54cents. (Wow there's always a first time!) The employees move slow and looked like they didn't know what they were doing. I think for new employees, there should always be someone who is shadowing them for training purposes. This place needs a lot of cleaning to do! Needless to say, will never go back to this location."}
{"text":"Worst pizza place I have ever ordered pizza from.... Our pizza came 35 minutes later then the expect time. It was cold, over cooked and no cheese. We tried calling the store and waited on hold for 45 minutes. Finally I got in my car and drove the pizza back to the store myself. When I arrived they were extremely rude. We will NEVER order from here again. 
Don't order your pizza here, pick another place!!!"}
{"text":"I don't know how this location stays open- I live two blocks away and had no idea it was here since it's in the very back of an otherwise-deserted plaza. I thought it was closed until I accidentally ordered from them online.

Why go to Pizza Hut when there are so many awesome local pizzerias? Good question. The answer is portion control. Those little personal pan pizzas are $4 and one of the only ways to get my pepperoni pizza fix without eating enough pizza for a small family and hating myself later.

But the quality is lacking. Picked up my pizza right as it came out of the oven and it seemed undercooked. Wing prices are good (8 bone in for under $5) but sauces are lackluster and meat to bone ratio is low."}
{"text":"Horrible. They lied and never called us back with no pizza. The manager got busted when I called him out for lying.  Spent over 40 bucks and we got served cold food by some guy who didn't speak English ,almost 2 hours later."}
{"text":"This Pizza Hut SUCKS!!  So frustrating to be told our one pizza would take 30mins. And we actually waited an hour and a half. Then we calked to ask if the order went through ok and why it was taking so long. Only to have some rude guy tell us \" its on the way\" and hang up on us. The absolute worst experience I've had with pizza delivery. Maybe Pizza Hut isn't as great as they say they are."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery, ate a piece each.  It tasted weird, couldn't figure out why. Finally realized the damn thing had NO cheese!!! Who makes a pizza with NO CHEESE???  In Wisconsin nonetheless!!  it was cold which we just attributed to delivery but the no cheese???  It's PIZZA ffs!!!  So weird!!!  And gross.  Two thumbs down, Pizza Hut"}
{"text":"ignored my call for over 20 minutes.  Hung up on after 1st 10min and never got to speak to anyone. Immediately called back and got stuck on hold all the way to closing time (11pm Sunday night) and hung up on again.

I get it. Its late and you want to get home. ANSWER your phone then and tell folks you aren't taking anymore carry out orders OR adjust your vmail greeting to say the kitchen isn't taking anymore orders.

Will NEVER order from this location again"}
{"text":"I had to give one star but clearly no stars is warranted. Did not receive my order as I requested. I asked for extra sauce and what did I get.....a super dry ass pizza. SMH what to do? Do I call and say something,  no since I had to waste my money I plan to make sure others don't waste theirs either."}
{"text":"We have ordered here on a few occasions. The staff is rude, and food is never ready on time. It's always a wait. I've waited in the drive through 10 mins, pulled out to walk in, and still have my pizza not ready when it should have been ready 15 mins ago. This was on a Wednesday afternoon. No real complaints on the food itself, it's ok, it's just pizza."}
{"text":"Worst Pizza Hut ever. I have ordered from them a handful of times (mainly because they are literally 1 minute from my house). Every. Single. Time I order, they are WAY (15-20 minutes) past the quoted time, and they always tell me that \"the driver went on a double, and that my order left 15 minutes ago\". So, I'm literally waiting for my pizza knowing it isn't fresh. I have canceled my order on several occasions because I am not paying for cold food. I will never order from here again. I will be sticking to Rosatis down the street, better quality of food, better staff, and they deliver your food BEFORE the quotes time."}
{"text":"Customer service is awful. Worst I've ever experienced. Manager on the phone has cussed at me and hung up 2 times now. All I am doing is inquiring about specials that they have right now trying to figure out the best deal to feed my family for the night. Apparently with the deal they have right now its 2 cents shy of being eligable for delivery, I was told if \"I can't afford to spend more than the specials then I shouldn't be calling to order food... ummm I'm perfectly capable of spending more I just don't need to, or want to. So f this place. Go else where."}
{"text":"I don't know why all of these other reviews are so bad. I come to this Pizza Hut ALL THE TIME. I order for delivery as well. Their pizzas are the same every time - perfect, warm, delicious - just the way I like it. Prices are reasonable for the quality. Quick service. The staff is always happy and friendly."}
{"text":"@ 10am this morning I was given the task to order a reasonably priced lunch for 150 people at one of our health clinics due to a flooding emergency. So I immediately began calling pizza places. Josh @ Falbo Bros. on Park St. treated me like an annoyance who he didn't have time for but when I called Emilio @ Pizza Hut on Park St. he picked up the phone, ready and eager to help me even before they were open! He spent a good 20 minutes on the phone with me taking down my order and making sure everything was exactly right. He was kind, helpful and is right now going out of his way to make sure that we get this order promptly. He also helped to keep the cost down to an incredible price!! I would highly suggest ordering from this location. I will update this review if there any issues with the deliveries or pizzas themselves but I'm not worried. :) Thanks, Emilio! Keep up the great work!"}
{"text":"Hot pizza! Fast! We stopped in on a Sunday. I showed them a coupon on my phone and asked if they would except it. They said yes. Awesome! The person taking our order was on top of things. Quick and efficient. Our pizza was ready fast. It was hot and very good!"}
{"text":"Placed order and paid online, received order confirmation with estimated delivery time...order never arrived.  I called the store about 8 minutes before they closed, after giving them an extra 10 minutes to arrive in case they were running late...no one answered the phone.  While on the phone with the main customer service, the rep told me food could still arrive up to 30 minutes after they close.  My order arrived 32 minutes late and was cold--REJECTED ORDER AT FRONT DOOR, and will go to store for refund.  TERRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE--will NOT ORDER FROM THEM AGAIN from this location!!!!!"}
{"text":"Wow. I called this place three times, only to be hung up on the first two times. Driver did not follow instructions to not ring the doorbell, but to leave the food on the doorstep but found my note AND food missing, so I called the restaurant to only get attitude from the man answering the phone for him to hang up on me twice and accuse me of hanging up on him the second time. WOW. Also told me his driver tried calling me when he was outside... never happened. Not sure why I was lied to. Never had a problem with this place until tonight. Totally done with this establishment.

Clearly, I'm not the only one to that feels a one-star review is warranted. Get a clue, guys."}
{"text":"This place is a mess. It's not even clean. No one is in the front attending customers. I had to knock on the counter and shout \"hello\" for someone to come to the front. To top it all off, I submitted my order yesterday for pick up at a specific time and the pizza wasn't even in the oven. The phone has been ringing for 5+ minutes and no one cares to answer. Wankers!"}

Called location they did not seem to care. If you read this and see the delivery driver in that honda please feel free to tip as if it were your car full of kids he almost hit"}
{"text":"If I could give zero stars I would. Very rude employees and bad customer service. Hope they get new staff. Tried to cancel my order and they asked for a reason why I needed to cancel. When I told them the girl very rudely just hung up on me. I called back and asked again and she said yeah it's cancelled and hung up again."}
{"text":"Wish I could give less than 1 star.  Worst Pizza Hut delivery experience ever.  I understand I'm not spending $50 for pizza, however I live less than 2 miles away and it took them 1.5 hours to get here.  How is that even possible?  I checked in with the store after 45 min and they assured me it would be here within 10 min....twice...then I gave up.  If it was just me, it wouldn't be such a big deal, but when you have guests its matters."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery from here today and to say the least - I was disappointed, again. No idea why I even order at this place knowing their food will never satisfy my standards. 

The pizza was delivered on time but for some reason it was cold, making the cheese all hardened, and not very fresh in taste. It felt like I was eating leftover pizza from the fridge at 3am in the morning after a night of drinking. 

I have no idea why the pizza was cold even though they delivered it on time, it's like they intentionally just left it sitting out there after it was done cooking. Anyways, it would've probably tasted better if I were to get frozen pizza and bake it in the oven myself. 

Also ordered a side of traditional wings, honey garlic and burning hot buffalo, which for a fact was not the least bit spicy. They were saucy, but salty. The 3 stars is for the fact that the wings were actually more tolerable than the pizza itself."}
{"text":"Never had an issue with delivery until today. My food was soggy by the time it arrived. I had to reheat the pizza for it to be edible."}
{"text":"We order from them at least once a week.  Normally everything is great.  But the past two times we ordered they messed our order up.  The first time the pizzas were made wrong, and delivered cold and over an hour late.  I called after we got them, and was told they would remake them and send them out again but it would be another hour...so I have to wait two and a half hours or more to eat dinner.  After we received the remade ones, we found that they were also made wrong.  How hard is it to read a ticket?  The last time we ordered the same thing, not made the way it was supposed to.  Sorry to say, they lost our business, we will be ordering from another place from now on."}
{"text":"Super friendly on the phone! Walk through everything, make special accommodations and we're just as nice when we arrived for the pizza! Really nice since we are from out of town and just got in and we're so hungry!!!"}
{"text":"Always has issues. Doesn't matter when you order, there always seems to be something wrong. This location needs a serious overhaul. Disappointing."}
{"text":"Literally never leave a review ever but I'm so pissed. I left special instructions for the driver to ring the doorbell twice and instead he knocks then gets mad when i don't answer because I didn't hear anything. Even when someone does knock I can hear it because they do it a little hard. So he must have tapped on my door. He called twice and I answered, both times and heard nothing on the other side and he said I didn't answer. (No Caller ID might I add) 
Then when I called about the situation they literally did not care at all.
Seriously how is this location still open?"}
{"text":"Was just on hold for 15+ minutes trying to order pizza... no answer. Pulled up to the store (while still on hold) at 10:53, friend went inside. At this point he was told they were closed. The door was locked behind him promptly at 10:55. They finally answered the phone after that... we did not order and won't be ordering from here again."}
{"text":"We ate here for early lunch around 10:35am and as the only customers at the time our counter person was very nice and helpful with suggestions on what to get. We decided on two pizzas, one was a Supreme, the second was a split topping of BBQ chicken and Italian meatball. We liked the Supreme and the meatball, but we didn't like the BBQ due to how sweet it was."}
{"text":"Order from this Pizzahut all the time. Like the previous review says - Standard Pizza hut. 

The only thing not standard is the manager. I think his name is Robert? Stand up guy. Top notch managing. There was a tiny problem with my order and he IMMEDIATELY resolved it waaay past what I expected."}
{"text":"Delivery time right on schedule.  Pizza good fresh and hot.  Wrong drink but still good!  Would order again!"}
{"text":"Terrible management and who ever answers the phone is rude there. I ordered one pizza online with extra sauce received a pizza with no sauce? Called & the guy on the phone took all my info and somehow couldn't find my order. The manager finally says she will resend it I agreed to giving the pizza they delivered back because she said she wouldn't redeliver without receiving it and made it seem like I was lying. Waited for the second pizza yes it had extra sauce but barely any toppings and cheese. Terrible customer service here. The driver was nice and understanding though and did say when my pizza originally went through that there was an order for a pizza with no sauce they probably miss them up this isn't the first time they've done this and the fact they sent me another pizza barely worth eating I'm writing this review."}
{"text":"Yet again... because I never learn my lesson and get pulled into the cheapNess of pizza hut.  Delivery was supposed to be at 730 and now it's 805 and nothing"}
{"text":"I only gave 4 stars because each of my experiences has been different. My co-worker and I normally order a pizza once a week or every couple weeks it depends on our mood. For our delivery yesterday it was as if the driver could care less about our order and just couldn't wait to get out of here. The pizza itself, was as if it was constructed from the pizza Gods and placed ever so gently in the box for our satisfaction. Garlic knots could use some work. We had blown out garlic knots which resulted in cheese not being inside of the knot but stuck to the bottom on the aluminum/tin pan."}
{"text":"Pizza had so much salt on i couldn't eat it. It was horrible!  Don't waste your money !"}
{"text":"The food is ok , but the service is horrible. The wait time is forever and the waiters and waitresses act like your table doesn't exist. We were literally the only people in there and completely ignored. Never going back again."}
{"text":"It kind of rips out a little piece of my soul...giving Pizza Hut 1-star...but we've given this location multiple tries (read:5-6 different times) and it's ALWAYS bad.

Remember when Pizza Hut was decent? It arrived on time, with a crisp (non-soggy) and tasty crust. The toppings were actually all the way on the pizza and it looked like a human made it. Well, that's not what you get when you order delivery from this location. 

Crust...soggy all the way through and almost burnt on top. (How do you even
do that?!)
Toppings: only 2/3s of the way on the pizza...the other 1/3 was raised, tasteless bread with no texture, no cheese, a little sauce.
Service: hit and miss...at least the drivers are always polite (that's the 1-star)

The sad thing is, when I feel like pizza, I tend to want Pizza Hut (like it used to be)...pan crust, crispy and delicious, flavorful sauce, fresh (non-greasy) toppings...not this gross saturated cardboard you get now.

I can always get Rosattis or Marcos (and I will from now on)...but come on Pizza Hut...step your game back up!"}
{"text":"My local Pizza Hut store at 4708 S 48th St, Phoenix, AZ 85040 has made my lifelong love of Pizza Hut go away forever. 
As a kid, my fondest memories are of my Dad, sister, and me eating at a Pizza Hut--it was a Friday night ritual for us for YEARS. We ate at the same table, with the same waitress, and ate a Super Supreme Pan Pizza with a pitcher of Pepsi every week. We all really enjoyed that outing. I even worked for a Pizza Hut as a waitress a number of years ago. I used to love the food, and I cherished the memories. Not anymore. 
The Pizza Hut I mentioned above is the store that delivers in my area, and I have lived here for 5 years. I have had several sub-par orders from them over the last few years, but I always gave them another chance. I don't know if the quality has gone down in the whole chain, or if this store is just a blight on the face of Pizza Hut, but ALL of Pizza Hut has now lost me forever as a customer, and I will complain about them now to anyone who will listen, because I am ANGRY. 
And why? Because not only did I get YET ANOTHER bad order of food, but the customer service debacle afterwards is as follows: 

I called to complain about the food quality, and they offered to give me a credit on my account, so I took it. They warned me it would expire in 30 days, and I understood that. Now keep in mind, this was a really large order and I spent almost $50 on it. The manager said he was going to give me $45 in credit, which I thought was nice of him, so I was mollified and decided--ok--another chance for them, I guess. 
So the next week I called to use some of my credit. I was told I had $40 (not the $45 I was told I would get)--so I was annoyed but was like \"whatever\" and I placed a small order for pick-up that we got for free. So, so far, everything is okay. The problem comes now-- the following week I call to place another small order for pick-up to try and whittle down my credit before the 30 days runs out, only to be told that \"oh sorry--any credit has to be used all at once\". Excuse me? So I spent around maybe $15 of a $40 credit and the rest is just ERASED?? And no one--not the manager that gave me the credit, nor the person placing the small order mentions this to me?? That is HORRIBLE customer service guys. Horrible. OF COURSE losing money you gave someone to use will piss them off!! So I get a manager on the phone and he tells me there is no way to go back and see credit that was previously on the account. (Which is either a LIE or is a reallllly stupid record keeping system.) He offers me a measly 20% discount on the order I want to place today (when I was going to be getting it for free, mind you). Would you pay 80% of something you had been told you'd get for free? No? Me either. 
So now, I don't ever have to worry about the food being crappy ever again from a Pizza Hut, because I will NEVER spend my money there again, and neither will my roommate, and I HOPE anyone who reads this review (that I am going to post on Yelp and Google and Facebook and anywhere else I can) will at least think twice about spending money with a company that pretends to give you credit for disappointing you but then just erases it without telling you you should have spent it all. 
And besides, the food quality is so pathetic at this store, I am guessing it is a chain wide problem and you folks should be shopping elsewhere for better food, anyway. 
What happened to you Pizza Hut? You were the greatest back in the day. Good luck keeping your market share up when you don't seem to care about your food tasting good, or the value of the food for the money spent, or of taking care of an unhappy customer. Goodbye forever. You'll only be seeing me on places where I can give you this review from now on. I will never step foot in another store or spend my money with your company."}
{"text":"Ordered an Italian Trio Pan Pizza & a small order of wings online for delivery on 06/14 at 7:30pm. (ORDER - 3150614213250001183026614)  The food was delivered on time (half hour) and the driver was decent enough. He brought extra parm & peppers so that's an A+!
I'd like to thank PIzza Hut for going the extra mile and unexpectedly helping me get to my \"ideal goal weight\" with just one pizza!!! We got some serious intestinal problems due to poor food quality or handling! 
One of us started vomiting violently at 1am and it continued until 4am!!
Me, well, I got to enjoy my day sitting on the toilet.
More good news; it's going to be a VERY VERY VERY long time until I can think of eating a pizza again without my stomach doing flips. So, kudos, to helping me stick to eating clean!"}
{"text":"Note: I have only ordered delivery, and that I've ordered online.

That said, the pizza we've gotten from here has been consistently fresh, hot, and tasty. I think there's only been one time that I was disappointed with the consistency of the dough, hence three stars instead of four."}
{"text":"Never again. Stupidly placed an online order at 8:30 p.m in which the estimated delivery time would be 9:10.
9:30 rolls around, no pizza in sight. I give them a call and they proceed to tell me they didn't get the online order. I said umm okay well its been an hour this is ridiculous. He said he wont charge me and the pizza should be here within 30 minutes. I told him what toppings I wanted and he goes \"oh I know, I have the order right here.\"
haha, but I thought you never got the order??
pizza hut you suck. Thanks for reminding me why I never order from you."}
{"text":"Gave it a chance after they messed up my order the last 2 times, but they managed to mess it up again. Ordered meat only on one side & vegetables on the other splitting with a vegetarian & the whole pizza had salami under the cheese not even fixable. Worst pizza hut location i've ever been to."}
{"text":"Ordered online. Only 20min pick up time. Convenient drive up window. Easy in and out access to the main road. The workers were polite and seemed rather happy."}
{"text":"They suck too. The order is always wrong. And the pizza is not good like it use to be."}
{"text":"Although we have ordered from this particular establishment before, tonight turned into our last visit to Pizza Hut. 

We ordered three pizzas with singular toppings and stuffed crust which totaled our bill to around $50. When it arrived the level of grease was so heavy that two full napkins could not sustain the flood. Not to mention the box was dripping on to the counters. 

When we called to make a formal complaint we were greeted but a manager that only insisted at arguing with us and offered at most to give us a $10 store credit after a $50 purchase. 

After a long debate they agreed to replace our pizzas, which was all we had wanted in the first place. We wanted the delicious pizza from the past but instead we received a single burnt pizza still covered in grease to replace the three we had ordered earlier. 

In short we returned to the restaurant with burnt pizza in tow after a bout with their general manager and informed then that have lost our patronage from here on out."}
{"text":"For some reason the thought of our usual pizza was not exciting me so out of nowhere I decided to order Pizza Hut online.  My husband was so confused when he was handed box after box: sweet chili boneless wings, honey bbq boneless wings, breadsticks, new veggie pizza on thin crust, bbq chicken pizza, and some kind of chocolate breadstick that is illegal in forty states. Everything was absolutely delicious. Like, seriously, it was so crunchy and sweet and savory and perfect and all cooked to perfection. The bread ended up being a huge order which I didn't realize when ordering it but I'm in no way sad that I have copious amounts of this chocolate sin. The sweet chili sauce was phenom and I am stuffed. You have a new fan."}
{"text":"I'm not a picky person, but this place is a disaster. I placed my order online, and after waiting a full hour and a half for delivery, I called the store to check on it and was put on hold. For 19 minutes and 39 seconds (my phone timed it.) The pizza came while I was on hold and it was a HUGE disappointment. We live literally 1/2 block from the store, but we were under the weather so we planned on delivery. Our pizza was apparently last on the delivery list so it went for a long ride and arrived lukewarm. Note to driver: Use GPS to route yourself BEFORE you leave. The toppings were OK, but the thin crust was completely inedible, tasted like cardboard. Ate the toppings with a fork and threw out the crust. Go somewhere else!"}
{"text":"I'm only giving one star because I have to. The pizza tookover an hour to get to our house and it was supposed to be delivered in 30 minutes. Also nobody answered the phones it just kept ringing. Worst service ever"}
{"text":"Pizza Hut has good pizza, but every location is different. My grand daughter ordered here and pizza was just okay. Doesn't look like the pictures"}
{"text":"Wow...simply wow.  Empty store (no surprise here). New employee struggling with working register and manager indifferently not helping him.  The lack of teamwork showing big time at this location.  Come on Pizza Hut, hire managers that care about their employees......."}
{"text":"First I will comment on the pizza quality. It was great! Nothing was burnt or over cooked. The bread sticks were super tasty as well! Nothing was wrong worth the food at all. 100% delicious. 

Now for the venue and wait times. The space seemed clean. I didn't go into the restaurant section because I called in to pickup. The ladies at the counter were friendly but busy. I waited about 10-15 minutes to get my pizza after it said it was ready on their screen. The line for pick up was quite long. I'm not sure what the wait is like if you sit down to eat there but it might be a tad long. 

My best advice is if you call in wait a little longer then suggested to get your pizza. The pizza is very delicious though!!"}
{"text":"Bad customer service, even from manager. They should be up to date with the company's new offers and changes! very disappointed."}
{"text":"Called in and ask for crispy Wings cooking thoroughly. Manager, Is making all types of excuses to cover up why he didn't follow instructions from customer it was me. Then a delivery driver older guy white hair adds inappropriate remarks towards how I should order next time. Wingz make you sick from this place. If you want food poisoning go ahead and eat from this place........
First of all your a 60 year old delivery driver thats all you have dude good luck chuck."}
{"text":"So tonight I order a Pizza from Pizza Hut. So I expect it to get here at 10:30 when the email said. But instead I'm here at 11 finding out that their delivery hours were over at the time. So instead of calling and telling me they decide to let me wait for my Pizza. I never even got my pizza. I am never going to buy shit from Pizza Hut again.

Much better to go to Jake and Sons down the street. There you have a chance of receiving your food and it's correct."}
{"text":"I wish I could give less of a star, we got 2 large pizzas on Sunday, January 21 2018 at 5P.M. 
The pizzas were trash, extremely greasy (literally dripping on plate, multi paper towel used during dinner) all of 8 pepperoni on whole large, stuffed crust wasn't too bad I guess but a little undercooked...best pizza hut I know of is the one on puritas and w. 143, I'm telling you. Won't be ordering from this one. Worst part is, I won the battle of where to order pizza from(pizza hut or dominoes) but she won the war because we both agreed that it was the wrong choice, but I firmly believe that was only from location."}
{"text":"This place gave me food poisoning on new years eve. Seriously screwed up everything. I ordered about 11a.m. or so by 8:30pm I was  sick as a dog. I didn't eat anything else that day hadn't even drank any alcohol. I got the pretzel crust mushroom and jalapeño pizza dinner box. Ridiculous, they need to make sure the food is consumable, I'll never eat from Pizza Hut again."}
{"text":"We placed an order for to go and then we had to make multiple orders and the person who took out orders is toooooo rude and he rushed us out"}
{"text":"Right by my house 
Quick and efficient. 
Nice lady works there, and haven't had any issues"}
{"text":"Ordered a pizza $13 from this location , to be delivered to me.  For some reason they siezed all the funds I had left in my account, pending and holding $120 instead of $13! Although they didn't charge me the extra $107 . It was left pending for 24hrs. I couldn't use any $ they were holding from my account and had to wait 24hrs for the transaction to process and $ to return.  They were no help at explaining why this happened and refused to help me.  This hassle was not worth a pizza! How does $13 go to $120!!!!  Will not be ordering from this branch again!"}
{"text":"The service here sucks! The ready time is a laugh! 30 mins after the ready time pizza was ready. Horrible!"}
{"text":"Worst pizza ever, and they got my  order wrong and late like always, NOBODY LIKES HAND STYLE CRUST that's why they are 5 dollars, I paid extra for a pan crust but brought me the nastiest hand crust pizza ever, the pizza was \"$11\" plus $3 delivery fee +$1 tax +$2 tip....total $17 on a $5 pizza .
Never having pizza hut again."}
{"text":"Yes a 5 star Pizza Hut. This is is dine-in location with plenty of tables and booths. Inside is super clean and the staff is courteous. This is probably the only PH in town with a family feel to it. Pizzas are made fresh to order and are brought to your table as soon as they are finished being prepared. Any parmesan cheese, peppers, napkins, utensils, etc. you need will be brought to you by your server. Much different than delivery! I tried the 2 foot pizza and that was tasty and then just recently i had a stuffed crust with pepperoni and sausage, They have these flavor crusts now and the \"hut favorite\" is garlic butter with parmesan cheese and italian herbs. It's real good. They do have delivery and pick up ordering available here however I'll be dining in at this location."}
{"text":"Pizza Hut promised to have it here in 30 mins. I can say it was here in 33 mins hot and fresh . My husband loved it . The 10 dollar box which consisted of a medium one topping pizza , bread sticks, and cinnamon sticks with icing and dipping sauce for the pizza . A lot of food for two people we had let overs for sure . 

They were friendly and helpful . Delivery was also friendly and nice . I would definitely order from this location again ."}
{"text":"I like Pizza Hut. They're been in my life since time and you honestly can't go wrong with pizza. Their prices are reasonable but wish it was closer to take-out prices/deals. And I know this isn't the place to get a salad (it came with the meal) but seriously, they drenched it with sauce so much that it was weighing the lettuce down. 

The staff here aren't that great though, at least my waiter wasn't. I mean, he wasn't terrible but felt like we were rushed to order and eat because he wanted to finish up early (we arrived around 8:30 pm) but when we wanted the bill, he was no where to be found.

I will stick to ordering take-out."}
{"text":"I love Pizza Hut that's why I'm giving 2 stars. But this particular location sucks. I ordered 2 pizzas online 1 Pineapples & Ham and 1 Meat Lovers . They delivered the pizza within 30 minuets of ordering which was nice. Buttt when I open the box the pizza was burnt and the crust was thin and crispy. The manager was very nice and replaced the order. But when I got the New pizzas they were the same \"burnt and flat thin crispy hard crust. The manager explained that the pizza dough had not finished rising yet and that's why the pizzas were coming out like that. I say that to say this. I pay for percent accuracy. If your product is not up to par for sale, DONT CHEAT THE CUSTOMERS and still sell the product if you know it's not percent right. I'll order from a different location from here on out !"}
{"text":"I had sent complaints to the coupon issuer, Pizza Hut, WI BBB and the WI Dept of Commerce.  I was forwarded Pizza Huts response to the BBB.  The CEO of Pizza Hut of Southern WI stats that there is a add on fee that I ignored.  The fact of the matter was I called the store after placing an on line order  to add the 'free bread sticks' and was not informed there was an up charge.  I was charged without my permission an extra dollar.  I GUESS THAT A COUPON THAT STATES \" FREE BREAD STICKS - NO PURCHASE NECESSARY\"  COSTS $1.00.  There is a disconnect here I don't understand.

DISHONEST BUSINESS PRACTICES"}
{"text":"It's just another Pizza Hut.  Not more or any less.  We have gone there in the past because our son thinks it is terrific and we are often there for the Wednesday evening buffet.  On Wednesdays it is crowded and the servers are rushed but I have been pleasantly surprised by the level of service they provide."}
{"text":"My food is always hot and ready on time. Never had delivery though. I always find the staff and pizza to my satisfaction. Its pizza hut pizza but they cook it properly and I've never had any of the problems other reviewers have had and my office eats there almost every other week."}
{"text":"Wonderful cheery person greets you.  Found out buffet that was to open 30 minutes before will still be another 10 minutes.  I was offered a salad in the mean time.  Went to the restroom.  Trash can is overflowing.  It is noon and no one is here.  How is it overflowing?  Person walks in from outside and goes behind counter.  Apparently he works here.  Just not now.  No uniform.  Hat flipped backwards.  He takes drive through orders.  I get it.  Just don't touch the food without washing your hands. No additional napkins out for a buffet?
Again, young lady greeting and taking orders is very professional.
I won't be back.  You can take your chances.  Pizza tastes fine."}
{"text":"Update on Pizza Hut (1/25/17):

I ordered two pizzas and some boneless wings on their Wing Wednesday promotion.  While the pizza was good, the wings were a major issue.  I ate one boneless wing and thought it was a little too soft.  When I bit into the second one, it felt softer.  After opening that wing up, I saw that it was raw....completely pink with just the breading looking cooked.  I sliced open a few more of the boneless wings to see that each one was completely raw.  

Needless to say, I contacted the store to see what they could do about the raw chicken.  I was transferred to two different people, with the final person as the manager on duty.  He apologized and said that because it was \"Wing Wednesday\", they were very busy and I must have just gotten a bad order of wings.  I was given a choice of a new batch of wings delivered to me...cooked a bit longer...or a credit towards my next purchase.  While I wanted a credit back to my payment method instead of a credit towards a future purchase, I guess their machines cannot handle refunding partial amounts of an order.  

It's too bad...I love Pizza Hut, but a raw chicken experience has made me not want to order from them for quite a while."}
{"text":"Wish I could give this negative 5 stars. Online ordered to carry out. Went to pick up and there were about 5 people in front of me waiting to pick up. Paid for my order and proceeded to wait another 20 min on top of the 15 since I had placed the order. The girl disappeared and no worker came out for about 10 min. The 'manager' finally came out after customers started requesting refunds. One by one they slowly got their orders or refunds. The manager, with one ghetto forever 21 leaf earring in, finally tells me my order for half with no cheese was a 'liability' and they couldn't make it. So after waiting 45 min they hadn't even started to make my pizza yet and weren't going to make it. If it wasn't an option perhaps why was I even allowed to order it online in the first place? And why did you wait all that time to tell me? This place clearly had no care for customer service or business. Unbelievable that they're still in business."}
{"text":"Yeh this place sucks no communication skills and doesn't give updates about your pizza I've been waiting for almost an hour in store"}
{"text":"I should have read these negative reviews before I made the mistake of coming here.
Ordered a medium with mushrooms pepperoni and pineapple  and was given a small (charged for small) 
Pizza looked to be the size of a mini and to boot almost 18.00. What a rip off. Same as other reviews undercooked and very skimpy on toppings. Will not be back."}
{"text":"I ordered online and gave them extra time to make my pizza. When I showed up they took my money and said just a minute. After over five minutes I asked what was going on and the clerk told me my order was never made. After arguing, in barely comprehensible english, over the refund for several minutes my pizza came out of the oven so i took it. When I opened the box I found it was not fully cooked and was not much more than raw dough (trying to make it in a hurry to cover up their mistake). They did not apologize or offer any kind of incentive to return business there. Will not be going back there ever.s
Poor quality product
Poor customer service 
Poor language skills
Bad Location and parking lot set up"}
{"text":"Ordered online, got the confirmation, waited over an hour and ten minutes for nothing. No call or update of any kind. When I finally called they said they would void the charge, we shall see. Never again."}
{"text":"I placed an order online for my bf before the store opened on Valentine's day. I selected the time to be 12:00 pm on the pizzahut website for the Valentine's day bundle. It got delivered at 12:12 pm, looking at my phone call history.

I'm pretty happy it's not too far off the time frame I wanted, especially considering it's Valentine's. I didn't read other reviews before ordering... and I would probably be too frightened to order from that location... but my experience was pretty good.

I was also worried the heart would come out weird, with extra pepperoni and cheese on a pepperoni lovers pizza, but it came out good so I'm glad."}
{"text":"I have to say manager was professional and credit my daughter. But the cook sent out 2 orders of burned bread sticks and the asigo one had no asigo.a missing item on pizza. Weve ordered before with them but this is the second time with burned food. Will use again because they are friendly and 3 times a charm."}
{"text":"They have improved their recipe quite a bit. The last time I had Pizza Hut was when I lived on the east coast and it was as bad as Domino's during their Noid days. Now they have both made leaps and bounds with their recipes. Their sauce has gotten leaps and bounds better and their dough is decent.

We had the internet only special for a large garlic parmesan crust pizza. They are still limited on their toppings compared to other franchise pizza joints like NO banana pepper as a topping and their veggie selection is weak too.

When ordering on-line one thing that I did not like was if you were getting a pizza w/ 2 toppings you could not get 2 different toppings on each half like how Dominoes lets you do. You can also not request for it to be double baked which i like b/c these franchise pizza joints always tend to under cook their pies (imo). The other bonus is it is literally 2 minutes from our house and since Papa John's doesn't deliver to our neighborhood we've had to look elsewhere for our quick and easy pizza orders for when we're lazy."}
{"text":"Absolutely terrible. I miss the old Pizza Hut. Where quality was key for them, I'm guessing times have changed. Very thin crust and none of my toppings stayed on. It tastes like cardboard. I will definitely not recommend this to anyone!"}
{"text":"Waited almost 2 hours for our pizza to be delivered. They said they could not find our address so rather than calling us, they just decided to cancel our order.  We called 1st time after 50 mins and this is when they told us this. They apologized and said a new order would be to us in 35 mins. Then after 45 mins they were still not here. We waited another 10 mins and finally got it. We will not be ordering from there again."}
{"text":"This Pizza Hut is great. For chain pizza this location seems to make it like was back in the day. When I order pan pizza it is thick and cooked all the way through. They always have deals as most pizza places do. When they have the deals for any pizza, any size, any crust, I wish they would honor that and not charge extra for stuffed crust. Any crust means ANY CRUST. Okay... I got that out. 

The wings are bomb-diggity! if you don't know about Wing Wednesday then you should check it out. Wings are 50 cents each. I get an order of 8 buffalo burnin' hot (boneless) for $4 and it comes with a side of dressing. There is a good selection of flavors.

Sometimes I order for delivery but usually just pick it up since it is close to my home and quicker. I always order online and never have any problems."}
{"text":"Food was 20-25 minutes late beyond the over hour delivery time.  I would not have minded, if the food delivered was actually warm.  Unfortunately, it was about the same temp as the cardboard it was boxed in.  Might as well have got a frozen pizza."}
{"text":"Terrible customer service. They don't put enough toppings on their pizza which would have otherwise been forgivable abd something I'd let slide but I went there today and place my order of 3 pizzas and paid by 9:02 PM (receipt says so). At 9:30 my mom followed up with the people behind the counter to ask where our order was because at that point, others who walked in after we did already left with their food. They said 5 minutes and I told her to calm down because these people probably ordered online for pickup maybe. Finally, the only other people waiting for their order got their pizza already (and we saw and heard them place their order 5 to 10 minutes after we did). Approached the counter and asked them where ours was. Some guy (the cook?) approaches another guy who seems to be the boss and told him that the one coming out was part of our order. Saw two pizza boxes that have been sitting on the counter for more than 15 minutes to ask if those were part of our order and they said yes. We asked them but they refuse to give an explanation as to why our one pizza got left behind, made us sound like idiots for asking or suggesting that the other 2 pizzas that have been sitting there may already be cold. They were still laughing amongst themselves over something presumably funny. Eventually the one guy who seems to be the cook tells us awkwardly that he is giving us 2 creamy garlic dips for free - he made it sound like we should be grateful that he is giving us the dipping sauces after we waited for almost 45 minutes (it was 9:44pm by then) for our order. They don't grasp the idea that they have provided such crappy service and they need to do a better job of making it up to a customer who is being perfectly reasonable and in no way being a diva. I'll take a better and sincere apology with proper explanation over two damn dipping sauces any day. Go to the Birchmount and Ellesmere one instead, been there many times, better people and they don't skimp on the cheese they put on your pizza."}
{"text":"I would advise against this location. I love Pizza Hut, it's been my only choice since I was a kid. But this location really falls below the standard. Since it was the closest location to my house, I kept coming back. I came here maybe 15 times total, and most of the time there was a problem. Either a staff member was rude, the order was wrong, and item was missing, you name it really. There is a serious morale problem at this location, a few times when I've walked in, I've had employees complain about their job to me, un prompted! How unprofessional. I must acknowledge the manager Matt for trying to help fix this, he gave me a free order after I told him what happened. But unfortunately the issues kept coming. So if you're in the mood for pizza hut, I'd suggest you consider a different location.

Also - if I may add. They never give you the receipt here. Maybe I'm just paranoid... but try asking them for a receipt! I've had the manager Michelle deny me a receipt twice! Why do they keep the receipts? I'm not sure, I can only speculate. But I think they are frauding the \"survey codes\" on the bottom of the receipts. Other yelpers... help me out here... and demand a receipt when you shop here please. :)"}
{"text":"We order a lot of pizza from this place, comes on time, still hot and tastes amazing. Friendly drivers and no problem."}
{"text":"I never expect a lot from Pizza Hut but this one is one of the worst I've ever had. You'll never get a pizza delivered on time or even close to being on time. Your pizza will be ice cold and most likely be the wrong pizza. Avoid at all costs. Surprises me that they are still in business."}
{"text":"It was pizza night! I called home to make sure my kids were excited about it, and then ordered the pizza so it would be there about the same time I got home.

An hour and a half later, I called the store to check on the meal. It turns out that if you don't answer an unnecessary call from an unknown phone number while you are driving, Pizza Hut will cancel your order, not alert you in any way and act like it's totally your fault that you thought they'd bring you food just because they said they would when they took your money.

The Domino's that services the same area? it took them 20 minutes total from my time of ordering at a lower price."}
{"text":"Just got some Pizza Hut delivered.  Great timing!  Was here in less than 25 minutes!  Nice and Hot and the Pop was ice cold.  A great meal to have on a hot and humid day!  Easy to order on line service is what I chose.  Even remembers your information"}
{"text":"Love their cheesy stuffed crust pizza! And my friend says they got the best hot wings in town :)"}
{"text":"Every time we order at this location something happens.  Usually orders are  (20-30min late) late, missing food..."}
{"text":"Worst management and delivery employee. I come home to my family saying they ordered pizza and never received it. The delivery driver called my father asking for directions to get here. He sent a picture and gave directions on how to get to our location. The pizza was NEVER delivered. My father tried to call the employee who was delivering the pizza. She didn't answer the phone. My father called to speak to the manager who was apparently too busy. It's been three hours since this whole incident and still no call back from a manager. So unprofessional. The least the manager could do is callback and pretend to care. I'll be looking to contact a regional manager. It should be easier to get a hold of them."}
{"text":"It is Sunday night and I put in my order online. it said it would take 20 minutes and it would be ready at 11:51 PM so I drove there as fast as I could and got there at 11:54 and to my surprise they had already closed even though their hours say till 12:00 . I understand everyone is trying to go home BUT you can't make customers drive all the way to you even though you told them their order will be in at 11:51, arrive before closing hours and just pretend they aren't there. That is completely wrong! Either change your store hours or serve customers until your posted store hours are marked. Especially if you know a customer is coming in. I am very displeased!"}
{"text":"I was in town for the weekend and decided to have a quick dinner with my family. I love Pizza Hut, like love, love them. This one was terrible. The sauce tasted funny and the crust was kind of chewy. This did not even compare to the bad service.

I made an online order and did not receive a call to confirm my order so I called them. They confirmed my order. My husband went to go pick it up. When I got up to get mine I noticed that both pizzas were the same. I called the store and spoke to a manager, she was kind of condesending and made me feel like I was lying. I asked to have the replacement delivered since it was just down the street. She wanted to give me credit and I said no because I don't even live there. She told me it would take 40 mins for it to be delivered and that she would call when it was on it's way. 

By then it was already getting late and I was starting to fall asleep. 45 mins passed and there was no call. I was about to call back when I finally got a knock on the door. The driver told me I had a balance due and I said, \"Nooooo...\" He said oh, you paid online? I said yes. So he said there wasn't a signature line and he had to get my signature. Then he said, that's funny, there's no delivery charge. I said I hope not. He then asked me if they messed up on my previous order and I said yes, I got the wrong pizza. Then he really pissed me off because he's still holding the pizza and annoyingly says, \"Well I wish they would've told me this was a freebie!\" Why would they tell you that? Does it matter? Do you do something special to it like spit on it before it gets there because it's free? 

So rude from beginning to end."}
{"text":"Ordered an hour and half ago for delivery... Paid over the phone and still waiting... Been on hold for 10 minutes... Very disappointed!!"}
{"text":"The pizza is disgusting every time I have ever eaten it. The doe is not cooked enough and when I called to complain about it the lady got an attitude with me."}
{"text":"I hadn't ordered from here in a couple years after multiple bad experiences but tried again the other night. A tall man with a beard helped me Friday night at the window and was very pleasant. Not to mention the pizza was BOMB! I ordered it again tonight and again, its one of the best I've ever had from Pizza Hut. Fast too!"}
{"text":"We called to order 5 pizzas for delivery. After 11 minutes of listening to the recording of the specials, still no one picks up to take our order. So, we drive there. 
   We get to the counter to order the specials I heard so much about while on eternal hold, and was informed that particular special went off last month. After calling the number back and letting them listen to their own advertising of said special, they refused to honor the deal!! The guy stated that he only had one job at Pizza Hut and dealing with this wasn't it. Are you kidding me????
    Hungry and defeated, we ordered anyway. While our over-priced pizzas were in the oven, we watched an  employee eat while not only making boxes but also making other pizzas!! 
  I get that it's not gourmet or a five star restaurant, but come on, have some pride and follow the health department's rules. 
  Definitely going to find another neighborhood pizza place from now on."}
{"text":"This sunday We order 3 pizzas at pizza hut in fort apache location, I ordered differens pizzas and crust but When I picked up the pizzas 2 of them had the same crust and I ordered  spinach and mushrooms with crush tomato but the other pizza had that, reallu a was so upset about that and the crust was undercook too, we order a pizza every single week but in other location, this pizza was terrible made and very bad experience I never order in this store again.
Never I'll order in this store again!!!!"}
{"text":"This is carry out location only. I purchase pasta with my pizza. I ask for forks and paper plates. The guy at the counter said they were out. Then the Manager came to the counter and claimed they never had them. I ask him how can you sell pasta and not provide paper plates and forks. He just stared at me no apology no nothing. I should've demanded a refund but I didn't. By the time I bought paper plates and forks the food was cold and I had to throw most of it out. Never will go back there again."}
{"text":"If I could give this location NO STARS I would. First time ordering from this particular Pizza Hut. Let me just say the large pepperoni was every bit of disgusting!!!! I've had better pizza from Little Caesars & their pizzas are ONLY $5. Now the boneless wings were just as bad. I ordered them mild &  when I opened them the sauce was so strong with a tart smell I couldn't even eat them. 

The pizza for sure was NOT FRESH. Even the marinara sauce on the pizza looked super old. I can't believe that a well known pizza place would have the nerve to deliver such a disgusting piece of sh*** like this to my door step.

Which cost me $30 dollars between the pizza, wings & tip. 

I will NEVER order from this atrocious a** PIZZA DUMP EVER AGAIN. 

I think Little Caesars is definitely giving this place a run for they money. With $30 I could have gotten a way better quality pizza then the sh** I just received from PIZZA DUMP. 

Oh and when I call & complain they offer me a credit or a new pizza.  I don't want your credit, however I did accept the new pizza which I will not eat. 

Because what I really wanted to do is drive to this location & throw that nasty a** pizza & wings right in their Fn faces. 

I could have wasted my money on better things."}
{"text":"Love this Pizza Hut.    Also love the sit down atmosphere.  Try there garlic cheese bread it's great and most pizza huts don't carry this!  Employees always friendly and happy!"}
{"text":"whole family got food poisoning. id stay away. would give no star if possible"}
{"text":"Yuck! Disgusting place. My table was filthy, sticky and I swear the \"dude\" that took my order was high on something. They also just happened to misplace my order and I ended up waiting another 20 minutes for my original pizza. I would not take your kids here unless you have bleach to kill the living organism on your table."}
{"text":"Mmmmm breadsticks!

We have ordered delivery a few times from this location so it was time for a review.  Delivery time is hit and big miss.   I've received my order 10 minutes earlier than quoted but I've also waited 30 minutes past the estimated delivery time. It's a crap shoot for delivery I guess.  When you have hungry people waiting, every minutes seems like an hour.

The pizza has also been on the same level.   Sometimes they are very chintzy on toppings and other pizzas are perfectly done.  I don't know how to feel about that.  I do know the pan pizzas are so filling and usually can only eat a few pieces before I'm stuffed.  

I know how bad the breadsticks are for me, but I still love them! Since I was a child,  they have always been my favorite.  They have always been consistent and remain a guilty pleasure for me!  Judge all you want!

I'm hoping the delivery times can be more solid.  Otherwise I can eat their food every once in a while."}
{"text":"It was absolutely horrible. We ordered delivery and after two hours it hadn't arrived. We called at the hour mark to see what was going on and was told it was in the next car to go out. I then called again after 40 minutes and found out our pizza wasn't even made yet! I'm sorry but that's unacceptable. We canceled our order and are never ordering from this Pizza Hut again."}
{"text":"The staff is usually nice. The boneless chicken ken wings are fricken delicious. Fast service, within 10 minutes of ordering in store. Love this place :] sometimes, though, there is an older man working there and he's kind of loud and rude :[ other than that, great ^^"}
{"text":"Ordered pizza and wings for carry out. Got to the store, paid, tipped, received my food and left. Employee comes running up to my car and asks if I got extra wings. Dig through the order and sure enough there are extra wings. I give the extra wings to the guy and he condescendingly asks how many wings I ordered, as if to suggest I was somehow to blame for his mistake. Guy was pretty nonchalant about it too so I'm wondering how often they chase customers out of the store to recollect food. Super awkward but at least the pizza was good."}
{"text":"The location  at 4th st Ne Calgary is garbage if you try to complain Leda hangs up on you. She had the nerve to call me a racist after I defended her in the store against a racist"}
{"text":"I ordered 9 pizzas online for a staff party for work. The website chose this location because it was closest the Cleveland clinic where I work and I wish it hadn't chose this location. We ordered on a Friday for it to be ready on Monday at noon, I get a call on Monday at 10am saying they don't have a delivery driver or enough people to make the pizza and that they need to cancel our order. After complaining and going back and forth the person on the phone finally agreed to make my pizza. 

I show up at noon to pick up the pizza and there's a sign in the door saying \"Sorry we will be closed until 2pm today.\" So basically the guy that called me just didn't want to come in to work. We picked up the pizza and our order was right, besides our salad which had croutons on it, and the person we ordered it for is a celiac, so she couldn't even eat it. 

This location doesn't even deserve a one star."}
{"text":"Called to order a large pizza. After holding for a few minutes, I asked if they were still doing the $7.99 large two topping pizza deal & the woman who answered and immediately screamed \"NO\" and hung up. Later I realized you just had to place the order online. Thanks Pizza Hut."}

To my surprise the one thing that I thought was going to be done wrong was actually the only thing they did a right I'm highly allergic to tomatoes so they actually didn't put any tomato sauce on the pizza's and they cut it with a clean knife!! (So bravo for that)! My huge issue with my order!! I ordered online picked out everything double checked my order at the end of the purchased before I actually sent it.. everything was correct when I received my big boxs dinner from Pizza Hut not only was the order wrong there was something wrong with everything except for the chicken wings!!  To start...  the first pizza was supposed to be pepperoni pineapple bacon with their garlic Parmesan crust and their white sauce I received only pepperoni white sauce and no topping on the crust which they did charge me extra for the additional toppings and I only got pepperoni second Pizza was supposed to have beef bacon peppers onions and the hut favorite crust I received sausage instead of beef and nothing on the crust!! To continue my breadsticks came with no sauce 100% Unsatisfied and Discussed !! I really don't think I'll be using Pizza Hut again which sucks because I really don't like Domino's either!!!"}

{"text":"This is the worst Pizza Hut location ever!! When I called to place my order, the girl said her name was Jade. She had issues taking down my address, so I spelled it out for her. Then, with an attitude, she told me to spell it slower, so I did. I ordered a double order of cheese sticks with extra cheese. I specifically requested for it to be delivered hot because the last time I ordered, it was like warm. I literally had to reheat it in the microwave. 

So, the delivery guy calls and advises that there's no apartment number listed, which is strange since I literally spelled it all out for \"Jade\" twice. Once delivered, not only was the food Luke warm again, but there was clearly only one layer of cheese on it. I gave the guy a tip anyway because it was raining, and it wasn't his fault that she screwed it up. I noticed that the receipt had a different name, \"Entered By: Cynthia\". I called back and \"Jade\" answered again. I politely recounted all of the above, and just as rude as she was before, she said, \"It sounds like you just don't like our food, so I suggest you try another restaurant!\" 

I was appalled! I said, excuse me? Is that how you speak to your customers?! She said yes! I said may I speak with a manager please? She said I am the General Manager. So, I advised that I would contact the owner and corporate offices. I'm in utter disbelief! I had to reheat this freaking $20 \"freshly delivered\" food, and you have the nerve to tell me to try a different restaurant?! How dare you! Don't waste money or time here guys!!"}
{"text":"Word to the wise...never order from Pizza Hut. Fuck these huge multi-national cunts! Go to the local Mom and Pop store round the corner instead. Sure, they may be a little more expensive and they'd more than likely fail any hygiene test the Food Standards Agency might want to conduct, but hey...at least they'd answer the cunting phone when you call!!! Why do i need to go through an automated message and then sit on hold when all I want to do is order a tiny pizza and some boneless wings. That's right...boneless!!!
 
Anyway, let's start at the beginning. I'll set the scene. Having been at work for almost four hours (fucking around on my iPhone for the vast majority of that time, I'm the first to admit it), I felt a grumbling in my tum-tum. \"Hello\", I thought, \"I'm hungry\". And how right I was. So, without giving it a moments consideration, I picked up the phone and called the local Pizza Hut store. Well, not the store obviously. No, my call went to some random person probably sat in an empty room in an undisclosed location. A genuine halfwit whose only purpose is to answer callers demanding pizza. The woman took my order and said the food would be in my possession within 30 minutes. \"Not bad\" I thought. \"Not bad at all\".
And with that I pulled out my iPhone, and prepared to endure a simple half an hour of hunger.
 
AN HOUR LATER AND I WAS STILL FUCKING WAITING FOR MY FOOD!
 
The lady on the phone, so it turns out, was a lying bitch! Incandescent with rage, I once again called Pizza Hut. Another three minutes listening to the gentle melodies they pump into the ears of those left on hold did nothing for my mood.
\"Pizza Hut...how may we help you?\"
\"I ordered my food over an hour ago and it's not here. Care to explain?!\"
The cretinous employee mumbled and stuttered as she tried to retrieve the details of the order. \"The driver has just left\" she insisted. How fucking convenient!
 
Another 20 minutes passed and still nothing. I was beginning to understand how an Ethiopian born in the mid-80s felt.
 
Then...suddenly...the phone rang. Deep in my heart I was wishing it was the Pizza lady calling to explain that the driver had been in a horrific accident and was currently being airlifted the nearest hospital. At least that would be a reasonable explanation for why my food still wasn't here. But no...sadly that dream-come-true scenario had not occurred. No, the caller was in fact the driver.
 
Now, let me ask you this. If you're employed as a food delivery driver you have a pretty short job description. Deliver the fucking food. This has three main components. Pick up the food. Put it in your vehicle. Take it to the customer. The first two parts are pretty straight forward. But the third part needs a tiny amount of planning. The driver needs to ask himself a question as he sets off...\"Where am I going?\". That's all he needs to figure out. But, I discovered tonight, Pizza Hut drivers don't worry about little things like the destination of their journey. And so it was that I had to instruct the poor man with an apparent GPS-intolerance exactly where the hell to go. He even had the audacity to propose that I'd given the wrong address!
 
YES! THAT'S IT. WHEN I'M STARVING HUNGRY I INSTRUCT THE FOOD TO BE DELIVERED TO SOMEWHERE I'M NOT. GOOD THINKING BUDDY. WERE YOU A PSYCHOLOGY MAJOR BEFORE YOU DECIDED TO GET INTO THE FOOD DISTRIBUTION BUSINESS???
 
Finally...at 6.25pm...a full hour and a half after I ordered...the food arrived. The driver chuckled when I mentioned that it had taken 90 minutes for the food to get to me. It made me happy to think that my increasing hunger and fury had brought some cheer to his evening.
 
DON'T FUCKING LAUGH WHEN I TELL YOU THAT YOU AND YOUR BUSINESS ARE FUCKING SHIT!
 
But, I shouldn't have been so upset. Every cloud has a silver lining, and this little tale is no different. Sure, Pizza Hut may have been an hour late with their delivery but they had a little surprise for me. To make up for their abysmal service they'd taken it upon themselves to give me...now wait for this...two free pieces of garlic bread. It truly is the spirit of Christmas! And what garlic bread it was. Cold and limp, just as I like it.
 
I paid the man...oh yes, he took my money. I was amazed he could use the machine he was laughing so hard! And I returned to my desk to eat the miniature pizza and the boneless wings. The pizza was cold. Some of the wings had sauce on them...most didn't. Every mouthful tasted of misery, regret and rage. Oh, and shit!
 
I was hoping that writing this review would help my mood. It hasn't."}

Huge disappointment"}
{"text":"I hate to admit, but I'm kind of a fan of Pizza Hut but please don't confuse that with me saying it's the best pizza I've ever had. There's another pizza joint closer to my house that I love, but the hours are harder to work around unless you're eating dinner at a decent hour. So yes, at 9:30pm on a Sunday I'm a fan of Pizza Hut. 

$10 dinner box: medium 1 topping pan-style pizza, breadsticks, and cinnamon sticks.
After upgrading the pizza with an additional topping (pepperoni seems so juvenile before you add mushrooms) and the breadsticks to cheesesticks, we got out for $12 and change. Service was ordinary, but the food came out exactly as ordered and quickly. Most importantly, it was delicious (not just edible). 

I believe this joint is open until 11pm on weekdays, and midnight on Fridays and Saturdays which is the only reason it got an extra star from me."}
{"text":"One word: AWFUL!!!!!! 

About a month ago, my parents took my two little boys to dine-in at this Pizza Hut. They waited over 45 minutes (after ordering) before my mom went up to inquire about their pizza. It hadn't even been made yet (??) but soon came out, hot, with the right toppings, etc. My parents weren't thrilled, but their meal was comped, and the waitress gave them some excuse about how \"the manager just didn't show up to work\" so they were ok with it. 

Fast forward to this week- we called in a to-go order and were told it would be ready in \"20 minutes\". My dad and I drive up to pick it up. As soon as we walked in the door, this is the sight that greeted us: an empty dining room (one occupied table, three dirty non-bussed tables), a waitress who was literally running through the restaurant, nobody behind the counter, and 8 people standing around waiting to be helped. 

Talking to the other customers we were told they were all waiting on pizzas that had been ordered on the phone or through the website. A girl walked up to the register and asked if she could help the newcomers, she told the lady in front of us, \"We gave your pizza to someone else. We are making you a new one.\" then tell us, \"Yours isn't ready yet\", turns around, and walks off. 

We spent the next 40 minutes standing there waiting for our pizza. As far as I could tell there were three people working, the waitress, a cook, and the cashier. The waitress was hilariously awful, between the rude attitude, the literal RUNNING from the dining room to kitchen and back again, and her form of communication (one guy gets tired of waiting and asks if he can just get his money back; she bellows, \"I NEED A REFUND UP FRONT\" as the cashier is nowhere to be seen). 

This place desperately needs new staff from the management on down. The cooks can stay, if they can pick up the pace, because once we finally got our pizza it was hot and made just as we ordered it. 

By the way not once did anyone in the restaurant apologise for the wait or offer to discount our meal, throw in a free side or soda, nothing. Really terrible experience for multiple customers and it was obvious they could not have cared less."}
{"text":"The pizza here is subpar at best. It's very greasy and should only be eaten in desperate situations.  Sorry Pizza Hut, you just don't do it for me!"}
{"text":"I had called in an order here and everything seemed good. Just ordered some breadsticks for delivery and when the delivery person got here she was very rude and kind of a jerk to me saying next time we won't deliver with such a small order. Which if that was true the person who took my order should have told me and if that was the case I would understand but the way the delivery person said it has turned me off from ordering from this location ever again. I'll just order from papa johns from here on out. When I order from them and just get breadsticks they will deliver to me with no problem and the part that's really annoying is that the place I have them deliver to is literally right across the street. Don't order from this location!!!"}
{"text":"After 10 minutes of standing at the counter, someone hollered \"be right with you\" from somewhere in the kitchen... and then promptly forgot. When i was about to leave, he came around to the front. I ordered a drink and 8 wings. He rang up the wings, and ignored me twice when I mentioned that I also wanted a drink. The wings were ok tho.

Service was terrifyingly aweful, the food was what i expected."}
{"text":"Service here has always been horrible but I like Pizza Hut and this is the only place that delivers to my house and with two babies it a pain to leave the house so I order it anyway. 
  I have been ordering Pizza Hut for several decades and never in my life, until a few nights ago, have I ever received a pizza that wasn't cut (actually both weren't cut).
  I checked to see if maybe they hire special needs employees and I should cut them some slack but oh no, that's just the kind of great employees they hire. 
  Their rating on Yelp has always been horrible and you would think they(management/owner) would do something to try and correct it. I guess the management/owner, like their employees, just doesn't care."}

Worst pizza I ever tasted in my life !"}

The ball is in your court to Double and triple check the accuracy and price of your order!  Smarter not harder my friends!"}

Picked up pizza with my kids and when I got home the pizza was BURNED. I'm not a picky person but after paying $55 I expected it to be cooked properly. 
When I called the store the person said she will put a $20 credit on my account. That is not good enough my family is hungry NOW and I need food on the table NOW. 
I'm usually very patient but this was not good customer service. I had to convince her to send me a pizza which is not burned right away which she eventually agreed to do after a bit of shouting.

My wife placed an order for a pizza, I picked up the pizza and brought It home. As we got into eating the pizza, we noticed the dough wasn't fully cooked. My wife called them back to address the issue. the manager on duty didn't apologize or even acknowledge it was a big deal, since they have people who call and ask for pizzas to be half baked lol WHAT??? What do other people's requests have to do with your mistake on my order. She asked if they can remake the pizza on thinner crust so we wouldn't run into the raw dough issue again. Fast forward twenty mins later we go to pick up the remade pizza and Lo behold the dough isn't fully cooked again. Seriously?!!  How can they screw up a remade pizza this is insane!!  This place either doesn't care about the product that comes out of there kitchen or they lack common sense how to manufacture a decent pizza that wouldn't get your entire family sick. Not to mention the joke of the staff and managers that work there. I don't care what special this place will have on there pizzas I will take my business elsewhere."}
{"text":"2.9/5 stars - Probably the best of the national \"chain\" pizza places assuming you order thin crust or the stuffed crust pizza. Pan pizza is a  1/2 cooked pile of dough..."}
{"text":"I have come to this one a few times. Every time I go something is messed up. The last time I came, no one gave me the soda I paid for. I didn't notice until I got home. I wrote an email to them and got no response.  I just came again for pizza, let them know what happened last time and their response was a mumbled, \"well that's no good,\" and stared at me with no intention of ever fixing it. Definitely won't be retuning to this Pizza Hut. Spend your money somewhere else, even Little Caesars has better customer service than that."}
{"text":"My mother placed an order for delivery today with Pizza Hut and they told her it would be 220 minutes before it would be delivered! That is beyond ridiculous and someone should be held accountable for it taking that long for delivery on a Tuesday evening. This is the middle of the week I can see if it was a holiday, Friday, or Saturday but this here does not make sense. If I could"}
{"text":"There's always something wrong with this place. Despite giving chances over and over, every single time something is wrong. So over three months since the last time I tried this pizza place, and as always, stuff is wrong. This time my pizza is under cooked, and icing wasn't even provided for the cinnamon sticks. What a surprise."}
{"text":"I used to go out of my way to go to this Pizza Hut.  Recently, they can't seem to get an order right.  Pepperoni Lovers pizza should have spots where you see the crust.  The online app gives to a place to request special items, such as double extra sauce.  They don't read it.  I won't order online anymore.  In fact, I'm not going to this Pizza Hut anymore."}
{"text":"Worst location ever.  Took 45 minutes to make my
Pizza.  After calling in the order, I sat in their lobby for 25 minutes.  When I inquired why it was taking so long, they simply said \"well, we're busy.\"  Ever consider telling customers that BEFORE completing the phone order?  You take our name and phone number for a reason....call if there is a problem.  

I drive to the Cottage Grove Rd instead of driving down the street to this location because they rarely screw up my order."}
{"text":"Order was nearly 30 minutes longer than estimated, I call and the girl who answers says \"he's on his way, so....\", when the delivery guy finally showed, he calls and asks me to come to his car because its raining outside! Are you kidding me!  Wings box was smashed and food was room temperature at best. This place is crap and deserve to keep the minimum wage they should be earning."}
{"text":"Sadly, this is the only Pizza Hut near me. Now, the food (when you get it) is good and the delivery person is always wonderful, but there's a woman who
often answers the orders totally lacks something. She usually informs me that the estimated arrival time of delivery is an 1.5 HRS! 
 So, yeah, thankfully there are plenty of other pizza places near by."}
{"text":"If there was anyway I could give this location zero stars I would. I called and a lady name sierra picked up and from the beginning she was extremely rude. She asked me for the address of my location. once I gave her the address she told me I was incorrect. I understand there's policies that we all have to follow but she was extremely rude about it. I was already hesitant of placing the order for delivery but I proceeded to order anyway and the first thing I order she told me they didn't have ,which was thin crest. The phone call ended fairly rudely. If you check my profile I have never left a bad remark so it is very valid information I'm leaving on this young lady. I hate to leave a bad review based on one person but management needs to recognize what type employees they have working for them"}
{"text":"Ordered online. It was a cute process...moved to this location couple months ago and was trying to find pizza that appealed to me. Tried Marcos, Papa Johns, Dominos....Pizza Hut was by far the best...Love that $10 dinner box! Anyway, ordering on line was fast and interesting, delivery time great, quality of the food excellent!!"}
{"text":"Found out that this smaller location will overcharge on food.  Somehow this Pizza Hut must be individually owned or something, because other larger (legit) Pizza Hut restaurants will charge 12+tax for a Large peperoni pan pizzas (on Mondays $10+tax), whereas this location only has the $12 deal on Mondays only.   Otherwise, expect to pay close to $20 for a large peperoni pan pizza.  I don't recommend this location."}
{"text":"This place was just ok. Average customer service. I ordered a stuffed crust pizza. The bread and crust were so thin, it scattered all over inside the box. I wouldn't have expected the stuffed crust to be that thin. There was barely any cheese on the pizza. I'd come back again, but I hope the quality is better next time."}
{"text":"This place has changed over the years. The manager is nice but one of the workers is the absolute worse. I think his name is Cesar. He doesn't wait on people. I was picking up a pizza and a couple came in. They stood there waiting to be seated and he didn't bother to acknowledge them. Pizza was gross and not even fresh. Not coming back again after 20 years of being a customer."}
{"text":"I can't even with this place. 
I've actually given them multiple chances considering how close I live to their location. The first time we tried this franchise they took our order down wrong. I don't just mean that we called in. We walked over and repeated our order to the clerk 4 times. She still recorded it incorrectly. Needless to say, we were disappointed. 
In that same experience a gentleman came up to the counter to tell the clerk he just received his pizza and it was \"100% raw\". I saw the pizza and can confirm that it was raw. I don't know why, but we went back. This time we just flat out received the wrong order. 
Tonight I was walking home from work and thought \"maybe they've had training. Maybe they'll be better\". This time we were just flat out ignored. The clerk just kept sweeping while we stood there waiting for help. Guys, never go here. It's outrageously horrible."}
{"text":"I don't like mega-chain pizza.  I don't like Domino's.  I don't care for Papa John's.  I've never had Hungry Howie's because frankly on their flyers it looks horrifying.  And I will never ever eat Little Caesar's again in my life . . . but I gotta admit, Pizza Hut makes a decent thin crust pizza

There were a few great locally owned pizza joints where I used to live in Tempe.  Tessio's and Boulders On Broadway stand out, but ya know what?  Sometimes you don't want to pay $20 $25 bucks for an extra large 3 topping pizza.  Sometimes you just want something decent for only $10 $12 bucks.  Sometimes you really DO want a decent cheap pizza delivered to your door in 30 minutes or less

The three years I lived nearby, I probably ordered Pizza Hut delivery or takeout once every couple of months, and I've never had anything to complain about at this location on Broadway

PS - the boneless spicy bbq wings are dangerously addictive"}
{"text":"I was here in town this past week. Ordered the usual stuff crust pepperoni pizza online but I had trouble. So I decided to call the store. I had solid customer service and gave me a good deal.  The pizza arrived faster than the quoted time of 65 mins (15 mins faster). The delivery guy was a nice young fit man. He was polite and went the extra mile to go back to his car to retrieve peppers and cheese. (Which I hardly get) the stuff crust pizza was one of the better pizzas I had in a recent while. Not to greasy and the cheese was incredible. Next time when I come into town I'll hit this place up!"}
{"text":"They had someone new take my delivery order. She screwed it up but after an hour the manager Manny corrected it all for free plus sent me a warm and gooey Hershey's pie!!! All no charge. Ty!"}
{"text":"I would give this Pizza Hut 0 stars if I could. DO NOT ORDER FROM HERE!!!!!  I have lived in this neighborhood since 2010, and this place has gotten worse and worse over the years. Trust me- DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME & MONEY ORDERING FROM HERE!!!!  
The food is made horribly (also made wrong!) delivery takes forever- so the food is often cold by the time it gets to your house, the employees/ management are rude, and they have also charged my bank account for food that I never even received.  Take it from me- I've given them so many chances, but it's always just a huge disappointment and my family will never give them our business ever again.  Order from Papa Johns or Dominoes, even Rocco's... but not here!!!!"}
{"text":"We have order many times from pizza hut, but the last two times was a mess. Tonight we have ordered and thing were missing on the order and things were not right. So we call the store to inform them of the problem they said that they would fix it right away.... And that they would issue a credit note as a reward, time passed, 1 hour later a new delevry came to our door to come and exchange us the problem,but never brought the missing item, really what kind of service are u offering????"}
{"text":"Ordering online or on the app is quick and easy as long as you don't have to call to change your order or anything because you will be on hold for over an hour like I was and by the time they answer your call, your pizza will already be at your door"}
{"text":"Poor quality of customer service. This Pizza Hut cannot handle the over whelming amount of customers via walk-in or telephone. Open another Pizza Hut!"}
{"text":"I eat a lot of pizzas in my life, and of course I eat
bad pizzas also but a bad pizza like This is my first time !!
The pizza was as sweet as a horrible apple pie, you'll be ashamed of you pizza hot I'm not going to eat any more with you!!
in one word is horrible"}
{"text":"Could I have bothered these employees any more than I did by simply walking in the door? A question of wether or not they had salads almost got me killed with a glaring look of disgust that I was even born. That was in fact the only time she actually looked at me. She mumbled a \"nope\" and gave me my total so I guess I was done ordering. She asked if I wanted ranch with my wings and I said yes. \"That'll be 49 cents\". Um. Ok Pizza Hut. Pretty cheap to be nickel and diming on sauce that should come complimentary but it's two quarters. I probably vacuumed that off my floor last week. You obviously need it more than I do. So the girl delivered the food to the table, still looking down and not at me. I said thank you and she walked away. Haven't seen her since. Not that I'm expecting a waitress. I'm just wondering who works here. It's literally just me here. I could definitely get me 49 cents back in napkins and straws and sugar packets and no one would know or care. Food was good. It's Pizza Hut. I got what I expected. I'll still order delivery and maybe come back to dine in. It is what it is."}
{"text":"Used them to deliver pizza to an establishment for my son's bday party. They were there 5 minutes before the scheduled time, food was hot and good. They just had one minor error on one pizza but that doesn't cancel out the positive experience I had."}
{"text":"My friends and I were hungry for some pizza so I figured why not give Pizza Hut a try. 

Of course, everyone wanted something different so when we ordered online we made tons of special request. We ordered the special with a large pizza, easy on the sauce with half pepperoni, ham and banana peppers, the other half with Italian sausage and mushrooms. A side of regular breadsticks with marina sauce and a 2 liter Mountain Dew. 

We got the confirmation....our order would be ready in 30 minutes! The wait seemed like forever, but when we got there we were pleasantly  surprised to find our order hot and ready AND prepared according to our instructions. YES!!!!

The pizza was good, the breadsticks were nice and crispy and overall it was a really good and satisfying meal! We will be ordering from here again!"}
{"text":"We ordered pizza online. The website gives you a pretty exact time that your order will show up. It doesn't say approximate or estimated... Meanwhile, the order showed up about 20 minutes later than the time given. No big deal, right? Well... unfortunately our pizzas were room temperature and had clearly been sitting for a while. We have to microwave our just-delivered pizza. Gross! It was extremely disappointing and completely unappetizing. 

The delivery driver, however, was very friendly and made the transaction comfortable while my 85lb Shepard mix barked away in the background. The 2 stars are for him, even though I'm sure he knew our order was old and delivered it with a smile anyway."}
{"text":"We have many choices for pizza these days. I have not had Pizza Hut in about two years.  Today they earned my business.  Great tasting pizza!!!  Delivery within 30 minutes.  Friendly staff I dealt with."}
{"text":"I had a nice young man help me at the register today, he was so kind, kinder than all of the other employees that I have run into there, he brought out my pizza, asked if it was everything I ordered, I said I had ordered a side of breadsticks and 4 sauces, which I did not see there when he brought out my pizza. He said no problem ran to the back quickly and got my breadsticks and 5 sauces!! I was so happy I got more that what I wanted and with no problem! I digged out my debit card out of my purse to pay for the extra and he said don't worry about it, if only the rest of the employees where this kind there..

Also the same young man helped a older lady there that was upset her pizza wasn't done in time, he offered her a drink for the wait, truly doesn't get any better that that. 

Keep up the good work."}
{"text":"I always order online. My order is always ready on time and properly prepared. Checkout clerks are  friendly and professional."}
{"text":"Worst service ever. I will never eat here. Put in an order 8:26pm on a Sunday. 2 hours later still no delivery. On the 3rd hour finally get a phone call that they are in my complex, which I denied. Don't tell me that my pizza is out for delivery for an hour. I don't want any old pizza. I will never order nor recommend this Pizza Hut to any one. Worst ever. Seems like the area because all of them are garbage."}
{"text":"I will not be ordering from this location again. I ordered pizza for a staff meeting (which I do about once a month) at 2:45 and asked that it be delivered at 4:45. It was at 5:15 I realized my pizza was not coming so I called them and spoke with the manager. Apparently the driver knocked on my office door and it was locked (not true my receptionist was here till 5 and never once saw someone come to the door which is all glass) then I was told he tried to call but the phone was out of service. REALLY? How the heck am I talking to you if my phone is cut off! The manager then told me that the order was canceled and my card was refunded. Not once did this manager get off her butt and attempt to contact me or contact the driver to assure he  had the correct phone number and address. 

I was very bothered that nothing was done to rectify the situation. Customer service is everything, we all make mistakes. Next time at least act like you care for your customers."}
{"text":"Service is hit or miss depending on which staff is there. Do not use the drive thru. People park in line till their order is up. They will not pull forward for you to pick up your order. The staff is pretty unfriendly. Pizza is still pretty good."}
{"text":"One of the best PH. Locally owned and operated. Friendly staff. Pizza buffet is usually a good quick lunch option which includes salad bar, pizza, pasta, bread sticks, and gooey cinnamon sticks. There was one day that they were terrible about keeping the buffet stocked and I told the mgr and he obliged with a free buffet. The drive up is also a big plus. My fave is the bbq chicken. One reviewer said it was dirty, but I disagree, and I am picky."}
{"text":"I'm sad to leave a 2 star rating for a Pizza Hut that I've always enjoyed and used to manage when I was super young. Therefore, I'm familiar with what it means to have good service and eat quality, well made pizza.

My last couple orders have been underwhelming with my stuff crust pizzas... Which my kids love by the way...I found the dough was not rolled out properly nor were the slices even cut all the way through. When I grab a slice of pizza, the slice had to be re-cut and it would fall apart in your hand because the dough was so thin and you can tell they tried to fix it by merging more dough on top... Which never works.  So basically, we had to eat chunks of pizza scraps because the pizza dough was a mess.

Definitely need some improvement at this location."}
{"text":"Pizza affects people in two ways: diarrhea or constipation.  You can really learn a lot about yourself figuring out which one you are...

But I'm not here to review the pizza, which has remained (more or less) consistent for the past couple decades (greasy, squishy crust...yum).  I came here to try out WingStreet, which I thought was a restaurant all its own, but is basically just Pizza Hut's retarded step-brother.

There are three choice of wings: traditional, bone-in (breaded) and no-bone (fingers).  I stupidly decided to try the breaded with the honey BBQ sauce...it's basically just that; all breading and no meat.  Definitely go for the tried-and-true traditional if you go.  I'm averaging my rating out to a 4, because...you know...it's Pizza Hut."}
{"text":"i love pizza hut and im always ordering delivery with them but today the driver just made my day. Came earlier than estimated & the food was great , as usual , an i swear the drivers getter hotter and hotter everytime. cant wait to order again! ;)"}
{"text":"I actually enjoy Pizza Hut; however this one in particular is closest to me for delivery and I am upset they are the only Pizza Hut near me that will deliver. I ordered one time in person and I will never EVER do it again. 

This pizza hut is small, you can't go inside, you have to order from a window like a walk up drive-thru!! In my opinion that is un-safe (especially in the area this pizza window is located at).

I tried ordering online (thinking it be a better and safer idea); I was wrong!!! Approximate time until your pizza arrives....1-2 hours!??! Are you serious? I wanted to cancel my order. 

So I called and they said they \"if you order around 7pm...it will be a while due to high calls\" and hung up. I was upset and hour later my pizza finally came; mind you I already had ate a small snack prior to the pizza arriving. 

Just know if you order from here...you will wait a LONG time for a pizza. SMH"}
{"text":"Order a pizza online for pick up, I came a few minutes early and it was already ready to go. It tasted great just like all pizza hut pizzas do."}
{"text":"Honestly, the service here isn't the greatest. It does take quite a bit of time for anyone to come out and help. I told the server when I first walked in that we had a cake for a family members birthday as a surprise...but when I later joined the table and she took our orders...she asked who's birthday it was...without us even mentioning it...kinda ruined the surprise there. Either way, they were a help to us...but did take long. 

The pizza is always good, but what I actually enjoyed was the wings, thought those were good."}
{"text":"I am so furious how this place handled my order. She would not refund me for a pizza that was so cold it felt like it was in the refrigerator! This was my second order for the day! The first time I ordered today they told me it was an hour and 45 minute wait. They came an half an hour early and I missed them at my door. I called to reorder and she charged my card six dollars more than she was supposed to. And this was the manager handling my order. I asked her if this would take an whole hour and she told me no. An hour and ten minutes later I called about my order realizing she over charged me. They would not refund me, they said they could only give me store credit. And that didn't include the taxes! I took the offer but I get my pizza and it was so cold. I told the manager and she told me the only way I could get my money back is if I was to drive all the way to the store and drop the cold pizza to her with my receipt! What kind of customer service is this!? She didn't even offer a brand new pizza to replace my cold pizza!! I've worked for the pizza business I know what customer service is! And this is outrageous! I will be filing a corporate report and get my money back. I will never order from this store again. I'm usually always so patient but this was rude."}
{"text":"After my last review, I was contacted to have the situation fix. Not only that, I ordered the next time, and the pizza was perfect! Good service!"}
{"text":"This place sucks. 3 hours and no answer on the phone and then belligerence and a hang up. All these crappy places taste the same so why bother getting upset about it other than just incredulity at the sheer apathy? Don't keep this awful place on business."}
{"text":"THEE WORST!!!! My pizza is always late or something is always wrong with it!!! Service is rude and horrible. And this is the only Pizza Hut that delivers to my address and my kids love Pizza Hut"}
{"text":"They gave the wrong pizza and refused to give the correct one. Manager was impolite."}
{"text":"We decided to dine in.   Everything was good till this homeless guy came in sat down right behind us.  He was talking to himself loud put all his stuff on the table.  I'm pretty sure manager saw him sitting there but she didn't say anything.  I was very disappointed about her action & definitely will not go for dine in there anymore.   But she changed channel to football game on tv so I'll give 5 star for that.  Lol"}
{"text":"Pizza for my kiddos for lunch on a half day of school for $10 for a large cheese!  Yes Please!  Ordered online to pick up after I picked up the kids and it was ready and waiting.  They downed a large in about 15 mins, so I guess they liked it!  I had about a half a piece and it was indeed good, but I'm all about the veggies on mine!

Love online ordering and drive through pickup.  Not the best pizza in the world, of course, but it was fast, affordable and just right for today!"}
{"text":"Quick lunch ordering. Easy options. Pizza made fresh within 15 minutes. Reasonable price. Staff was efficient and provided all napkins and utensils with order."}
{"text":"Tried to order a pizza and wings to my hotel, we are only 1/2 mile away.  Was told that they were too busy for delivery at the time and I could go pick it up.... I was under the impression that Pizza Hut was a pizza DELIVERY business..."}
{"text":"I literally live about a mile away, but was told they wouldn't deliver to me because they don't drive over the Cactus bridge into Mountain's Edge. They told me to call one further away. I guess they are so rich they don't need my money."}
{"text":"I have been ordering from this store on and off hoping the quality would improve. However not only has the quality not improved, but now they are ripping people off. Ordering extra or double some item, does not translate into more of it. They charge you for the extra but they do not provide it. The managers are responsible for ripping people off... 

Avoid this store or Pizza Hut in general as they tend to rip customers off."}
{"text":"Based on the previous reviews I would suggest PICK UP ONLY  from this location. I always order at the location and have not run into any issues because I can open the pizza to make sure it looks okay and if I have any issues I can address it right then and there!  Overall, the pizza is not bad, when it first opened I would say that the pizza was a bit under cooked (the crust) but as of late when I order the pizza is pretty good no complaints, don't have to wait long and I get decent customer service. So if you are in the St. Lawrence area and want Pizza Hut I would just suggest getting pick up and not delivery from this location and your pizza will turn out just fine"}
{"text":"This place has delivered our pizza exactly right each time and very quickly. Great experience and great prices. The one time they didn't give the delivery guy our bottle of Pepsi, he came back 20 min later and gave us 2 bottles to make up for it. Mistakes happen but as long as the food is good and mistakes are corrected, I'm ok with that. Will continue ordering here!"}
{"text":"This is the worst Pizza Hut I have ever gone to!!! It feels that no one understands what the customer is asking for! I have numerous times ordered from this place and have asked them every time, several times in a call to PLEASE DO NOT CUT or SLICE the Pizza's cause my kids are allergic to pork.  They catch an attitude on the phone cause I repeat myself... yet when I go to pick the pizzas or get them delivered, they are cut EVERY time. It never fails! I would give them lower than a 0 if I could!"}
{"text":"I love Pizza Hut. This particular location along every other restaurant on this block has the same problem. Employees act like they don't want to be there. This location is very busy. pizza quality is good. Dine in ambiance is good and clean."}
{"text":"I had walked in here with a co-worker/friend once last year. There was an older gentleman that works here and my friend made it very clear that we were not sure if we were staying, but we just wanted to check out what they had for the buffet. The employee was surprisingly very welcoming and friendly and told us that they were about to set it up. We had actually left since my friend was craving Chinese food but then we ended up returning and staying. 

I didn't know what to expect from the buffet as this was my first and only time so far. The place had a few other people but it wasn't crowded or full. They had pasta at the buffet. The pizzas were not left overs but were freshly made varieties that were perhaps medium size and they would bring them out one by one. I ate as much as I could but my only regret was that I was too full to try the dessert pizza. The older employee that was serving us was great, very friendly and pleasant. He actually took good care of us and kept coming by to check if we needed anything. We were very impressed by him. My friend who usually said that a tip should not be expected felt that he deserved one.

I have dined here last in January and the pizzas were really good. My only complaint was that people had their noisy kids running around, but it's not the restaurant's fault! I also ordered take-out this month and the pan pizzas were oily but delicious."}
{"text":"I have been coming year for many years, mainly because of it being easy to get to from where I live as most locations are just as far. I'm not sure if the servers are mostly students from the nearby college. It used to be a descent place years ago but some other reviews confirmed what I also suspected and noticed. It appears that the management has changed and this place has become awful. 

I was dining here once with family and I had a coupon for a pair of large specialty pizzas at a good price, so we wanted a meat lovers and a super supreme. We watched as our server went to the front and asked the manager about this deal. After a short discussion she came back saying that we were restricted to only a few choices such as the Canadian pizza; basically just the few specialty pizzas with the least amount of toppings. The cheap manager didn't want to honour the coupon for the full value. 

I had also been here twice with family and a friend just days apart during the same month because of my birthday. Both times I noticed that the utensils such as the forks were not properly cleaned and I'm not talking about water spots.

This place is a disgrace to Pizza Hut and I keep getting the impression that they are trying to cut corners everywhere. Some servers are still nice and I do visit here very occasionally but this location ruined the whole Pizza Hut experience for me.  For how expensive their pizzas are and after tipping them and paying extra for dine-in, this place doesn't deliver on quality and value. I've never been so disappointed with Pizza Hut in all my life.

Update: (March 18/2015)
I was hesitant to revisit this place but I ended up coming here once more with family. Our server was nice but the hot water my family asked for was lukewarm (without lemon slices like some other places). I didn't get a straw with my cold water but I had to wait a good while till she came back with out pizza to ask her for one. At another location the server asked us if we wanted parmesan cheese and chilli flakes, but this place only had chilli flakes on the tables with the salt and pepper. The other location served mints with the bill and this one did not go the extra mile. I could care less about minor things but I ordered a veggie lover's pizza with a regular pan crust and for some reason the crust was really dry. It just felt like they were skimping on a lot of things but still charging the pizza hut price."}
{"text":"Ordered the meat lover's, especially for the price, it was very disappointed. Barely any toppings, had the feeling toppings were missing. Stuffed grilled cheese crust was not good, had to skip eating those. Wings were alright, unfortunately didn't come with dipping sauces but I should've checked that before I ordered."}
{"text":"I called the Pizza Hut on Tropicana, and I was told by James that will take about one hour and half to he the carried out ready and hung up on me. I called back and he was very rude, the worst experience I ever had, never will call Pizza Hut again."}
{"text":"Manager of this store refuses to deliver. He states they are closed at 10:15 am. The store hours are 10:00 am - 12:00 pm. Guess I'll take my business to a competitor."}
{"text":"DO NOT EAT HERE. Do yourselves a favor and shut this location down. Worst pizza literally on earth."}
{"text":"Never eating pizza hut ever again that pizza made me really sick I spent a whole day throwing up ."}

Pros:
- Good Service
- Buffet pizza gets re-filled consistently
- Well priced.

Cons:
- None"}

{"text":"Pizza Hut is my son's favorite pizza. I appreciate the ease of ordering our food online and watching the countdown until our doorbell rings. This  Pizza Hut location is courteous and friendly.  If you live in Concord or Harrisburg area it would be worth the drive to visit this location on 29."}
{"text":"Never again. Have been away a few years and since moving back decided to get some Pizza Hut. First they didn't have what I ordered using the app so they replaced it with something similar but not as good. And decided to charge me the same price for it all too. The 8 boneless wings looked like they took 4 and cut them all in half. Seriously, I'd be embarrassed if I owned this restaurant and let that order go out my door. Needless to say I drive down there to show them. They gave me a credit I had to use within the month. Perfect since I don't eat pizza too often. I decided to use it up before it expired. Ordered 8 piece spicy garlic wings got buffalo medium. Only half the wings looked minuscule this time, so although they got the flavor wrong, at least the size is improving. Not going to complain twice to people making food for me. Not to mention the cashier I dealt with last time and the guy giving me my food exchanged a few glances as I picked up my order that I'm convinced they either changed the wings on purpose or did something else to my food."}
{"text":"Ordered a big dinner box with wings. What I got was a big dinner box with wings that were hastily splashed with sauce, not really on them, but in the foil they were tossed into. Asked for hut seasoning on both of them, got it on one. Asked for one of the pizzas to be well done- they were barely baked. As I was eating the pizza I kept coming across hairs. I have a dog and the hairs looked similar enough that I just figured it was from my dog. The red flag should have been that they were in places where my dogs hair shouldn't have been able to get to since I had just opened the pizza box, such as under the pizza crust. Fast forward to the next day eating left overs. I come across more little hairs that look like they could be from our dog, until I find one really long one that is baked into the cheese/pepperoni. My girlfriend and I immediately stop eating the pizza, feeling sick knowing that the hairs now from the day before were probably also not from our dog. So the moral of this story is-- steer very clear of this location and possibly just Pizza Huts in general. But hey, I'm out $24.36 and people will still probably go to this location, so they are the real winners here. You've been warned."}
{"text":"Ordered from here for delivery at 6:30 and was still waiting till 8 pm. I had to call them twice to see what the hold up was and apparently their driver had come to my address twice and kept calling to deliver the pizzas. I was sitting next to the door and did not hear the phone ring once. Turns out that the person at the restaurant had the wrong phone number written down and the manager called me back on my number (wonder where he got the number from if it was written down wrong) and basically called me a liar. Worst service never go here because they will treat you poorly."}
{"text":"I always love Pizza Hut no matter where in the world it is from Hong Kong to Toronto!

I've been visiting this location for quite some time now. It's always been good in terms of its food but a bit lacked on the service side. Having just recently been back after 2-3 months, I've noticed they now have a Creamy Butter Chicken pizza! Sounded so tempting and exotic, my friends and I decided to try that as well as our typical go-to Canadian pizza.

The Creamy Butter Chicken pizza includes its butter chicken sauce, grilled chicken strips, roasted red pepper, red onion and mozzarella. On the other hand, the Canadian pizza has pepperoni, bacon crumbles, mushrooms and mozzarella. Because the Butter Chicken pizza was new to us, we ordered a medium of that and a large of the Canadian.

We were surprised how good the Butter Chicken pizza was in comparison. It tasted flavourful and worked really well as a pizza overall. Imagine it not rich as your actual butter chicken sauce yet it's still good enough:) The Canadian is always well made, your typical saucy pepperoni pizza! Oh keep in mind, we stuffed crusted everything haha - it's too good to not give in on cheese! Their Caesar salads are also very delicious too if you want a healthier option or for your side.

P.S. There's a really good deal going on now that if you order a medium/large pizza, your second pizza is only $5 (of course before stuffed crust).

Service overall is mediocre as it varies. I've had good times and bad times where flagging down a waitress took ages and for them returning with water or the bill also took as long. I do find this location slightly understaffed at times - perhaps this is the reason."}
{"text":"OMG. 

I recently ordered Pizza Hut to my house and was completely blown away. It never used to be THAT good, I was so floored I ate 6 slices. This particular location I ordered from is situated right down the road from my house and they just underwent massive renovations. It went from an old school Pizza Hut to a sleeker more modern venue. I am not sure if the renovations had anything to do with the increase in quality of pizza, but there was definitely an increase of something. 

4 of us ordered two mediums. One with green peppers, mushrooms and onions. The other (mine) had double pepperoni and onions. When I was ordering over the phone I explained to the kind lady on the other side that whenever I have ordered double pepperoni in the past I have always been hard chinced and I've gotten some slices with a measly 2 pieces of pepperoni. She made a note and ensured me there would be nuff pep to go around. Let me tell you, lady on the other side wasn't lying! My pizza was riddled with pepperoni and it was beyond fulfilling. 

Both pizzas was perfectly uniform and neatly prepared. Every bite was so deliciously fat it was borderline the best Pizza Hut I have ever had. I felt like I was 10 years old again and at Jimmy's Birthday party (back when they had the desert bar!) With each bite of the crust was an explosion of butter, just insanity. It was so good that I'm afraid to ever order it again because I'm afraid it won't live up to my last experience. But who am I kidding, I can't wait to order it again. 

Please keep in mind this is how I feel about this particular location. Although it is a franchise, I firmly believe there is still a variation in pizza between franchises. 

Another thing to note is that Pizza Hut's lunch buffet is only $7.99, although the slices are a bit smaller than regular, it's still ayce and an amazing bargain. 

If you're a mainstream pizza basher and are only interested in authentic style pizza, then look no further than Libretto's dt.

{"text":"ok. This one has been bad for awhile, but i said that if i got three good orders in a row from them i would write a good review.

I used to order from here two years ago, then it got bad...like soggy pizza 1.5hr delivery bad. They seem to have hired many teenagers lately, idk but the food is good, delivery is faster.  I also noticed one kid at the store will call to clarify the orders sometimes if he was unsure (I order online) I really like that, better than messing up my stuff.

The CRAZY CRUST PIZZA WAS AWESOME. I think because the stuffed crust is made with one kind of cheese, blah tasting. This pizza has a cheese blend. So good! I have a pic on my FB btw."}

{"text":"Do not order pizza from this location.  I cannot speak for other locations, but if you order from this location you risk your order being inedible and disgusting.  

I ordered a garlic stuffed crust cheese pizza and there was green residue on my pizza and it tasted like cardboard.  I had to throw it out and ask for my money back."}

{"text":"Dined in during the week last week and the service was great! There was another couple eating and other customers picking up. 

The employee was super friendly and helpful with showing us what deals they had to offer. We ended up ordering a chicken alfredo pasta, large pizza supreme, an order of breadsticks and a drink. We waited about 15 minutes for our food and she brought it all over to us as soon as each item was ready. 

Definitely will be back since the employee who helped us was nice and the food tasted great!"}
{"text":"Worst service ever! This is a Scottsdale pizza hut and they cant make an hour quote on a Sunday night at 7:32pm?

Called and cancelled and they didnt care pr apologize!  Never offered an eta on driver status or why it takes an hour and more? 

Spent $40 and no pizza! 

Dont use this place and also an note the the franchisee, hire someone other than a child to run your business and you might grow it and make a real profit! 

Crap service and no one cares."}

{"text":"Ordered for delivery and at the time I was supposed to receive my food they call and say the driver started to leave but had car troubles? So they tell me that they'll send another driver and my food has been sitting there for at least an hour and a half and I want to cancel and they don't offer to make me a new pizza after the first call about the broken car. Apparently couldn't cancel and they sent their driver all the way here for me to refuse the food. It was just a mess, won't order here again."}
{"text":"Oh lord. This star-dom is accurate. 4 stars, folks!

Occasionally, I just need a cheap, quick, greasy pizza fix! Pizza hut has delivered (laughs, anyone??) when I've ordered online and by phone. The orders have never been messed up either. Here's where the high rating comes from:

Tonight, I tried using a 10+ year-old gift card. I still swear there is a balance on the card, so I'll try it again sometime. Someone from the restaurant called me twice (the first time they were disconnected from me!), letting me know the gift card didn't go through, and my order had not been charged at all, nor paid for (ugh!). I took care of it over the phone, and they claimed my order would be expedited. Well, I took it as a nice gesture and appreciated the great customer service.

Thanks for the slice(s) of GOOD customer service, Pizza Hut!"}
{"text":"Bad experience, I made an order around 8 pm they advise me  my food would be ready in 40 mins. I order 2 larges pizzas, pasta, wings. After 1 hour waiting for my food to arrive, I called and asked how much longer for my food.  They said it was ready and ready to be picked up. First of all, I usually order pizza because its easy to be delivery and offer delivery service. I told them I didn't have a car there's no way I can pick up the food. So they deliver and receive  it around 1015pm was very disappointed."}
{"text":"I never got my pizza and tried calling several times starting at an hour after my pizza was supposed to be delivered. Then when they finally answered one of my calls 3 HOURS later the woman said that they don't deliver to my area even though I placed my order online and it gave me the store in my service area for delivery... She then had the audacity to say \"well if you had called earlier I would have had it delivered.\" I work 12 hours on 3rd shift, and can't leave my place of business. Now I'm without dinner AND it's going to take 3-5 business days to get my money back. Never ordering from here again and definitely calling customer service."}
{"text":"By reading the other reviews at first I was debating to order from here... But I gave it a try and been coming ever since people are fast and ready always with my food... Customer service is great the girl at the counter always attends me with great attitude and fast service so I say ordering from here is good I recommend it. Keep up the good work guys"}
{"text":"I would honestly give a 0.
We order our pizza at 4:10 and at 4:27 they sent me a message saying my pizza was on the way. It took them 45 MINUTES for them to get me my pizza. I couldn't even enjoy it because it was so over cooked and the stuffed crust was not even that, just a thin tiny layer on the inside and some flavoring. I'm honestly SO disappointed in this because Pizza Hut is our Go-to and we weren't able to enjoy this. It was just one pizza as well so it baffles me it tool them over an hour to get it to us.
I even called them after waiting 30 minutes asking if they were okay or if our pizza did leave, she reassured us it would be there any minute now. Waited 15 minutes more then they finally showed.
The driver told us about the survey and getting 10-20 dollars off but they didn't even apologize for the long wait or mention anything.
I won't be ordering from this location any longer. I hope this doesn't happen to anyone else."}
{"text":"Avoid this place like it was the plague.  The pizza from this location is always undercooked, and this past weekend we had a ball of hair on our Veggie Pizza.  It wasn't just one random hair, which would still be be gross, it was if someone had emptied an electric shaver on one of the slices.
Due to previous poor quality we didn't even bother to call it in, just threw it all out and ordered a new pizza from a local place."}
{"text":"Make sure you ask for bacon all over the pizza if not it may look like mine  this is fucked up and I asked for garlic butter crust on  both pizzas and only got it one  25 $ + 7 $ delivery Tip later. Booo! 

05/02/17. I ordered Pizza Hut today and I think it only fitting I Yelp my results. My pizza was beautiful and tasty. That's just the beginning, my delivery guy Scott was on top of his shit! He brought plates, napkins, Parmesan cheese, and peppers. We didn't even ask cause truth be told we always forget but good job Scott, we appreciate it!  I gave you the five stars because you earned them. Thank you!"}
{"text":"The $10 dinner box is a good deal. The pizza is square (pan style) in this situation and you usually get one topping, but I paid about 2 bucks more for all veggie style. Ten cinnamon sticks and five breadsticks also included and no way can one person eat this feast. It's not gourmet, but it arrives in 45 minutes still hot and fresh and as long as you don't over eat, it makes for a decent meal a few times a year."}
{"text":"Pizza was fresh and Hot when the driver arrived to my home.
Great flavor 
Great taste 
Pizza arrived 30mins of ordering on the phone.
Being from Chicago I use to the best of the best Pizza!
But for being a franchise brand it's not all that bad!"}
{"text":"I would give zero but then I can't leave a review. Ordered online for delivery. Ordered 16 piece boneless honey bbq wings, large pepperoni pizza and a cookie dessert. Originally told 1 hour then it took over an hour an a half. Opened the pizza and it was not pepperoni it was an everything pizza and we don't eat certain items on that pizza. I called for a refund and they told me I had to come in for a refund. It is 11 at night I'm not driving over there to get a refund. This is unacceptable. Will not be ordering from pizza hut ever again. Also the wings were not covered in the sauce I had to shake the box they were in to cover them."}
{"text":"Honestly, don't waste you or your families time by dining in here. They are happy to charge you more for eating at their booth but aren't going to serve you. Normally I wouldn't bother writing a review but it gets a little ridiculous when your the only family in the whole place and the service is so bad that they can't even find the time to bring you plates. No curteousy. No manners. And besides the bad service in general, expect long wait times for your food. And dont be shocked when you start counting all the people that order and get served before you. Once you sit in that booth, the kids running this place would rather stand around gossiping than bother looking your direction until it's time for you to pay."}

Pros:

- Breadsticks are stale"}

{"text":"Good pizza and delivery, but I give it 3 stars for the delivery driver in the red Subaru almost rear-ended me. I was driving to pick up my pizza, and at the light at 19th and Butler a car almost rear-ended me. After I turned, he followed me, then sped around me at about 50mph (10 miles over the speed limit) then jerked into the parking lot at the corner of 19th and Northern. At that point I noticed he had the delivery light for Pizza Hut on his car. As I went in to get my pizza, he kept walking past the counter looking at me. It was weird. Please tell your delivery drivers to not give other drivers heart attacks as they try to go get their pizza. And drive the speed limit. That would be good, too."}

I live in Bay Village and I have to get pizza from the one in Rocky River because the one in Bay Village only delivers to half of Bay Village. I mean I only live like 2 streets away from the one on Dover and they don't deliver to me. Absolutely ridiculous"}
{"text":"UPDATED REVIEW:

Last I went to this pizza hit, they screwed up my order so they told me that they would credit the $16 to my Pizza Hut online account..... today I check my account and find that I actually have NOT been reimbursed or credited for that day. I mean I'm not trying to get money back or whine about $16 but if you're going to tell your customers that they're going to reimburse your account .... I think they should???? I never even asked for a refund, they TOLD ME THEY WOULD refund me and credit it to my account. And now I'm sitting here with no credit and never coming to this Pizza Hut again. I don't even care that they are across the street. I'll drive to a better location... where they'll get my order right and then follow through with promises of a refund... such an annoying thing to deal with when companies can't even pull through on their end. 

********











Upon arriving, I had to wait 10 minutes while the cashier was on the phone with another customer. Understandable and not her fault, but other employees should be able to assist carry out orders while she is taking phone calls. However, Cylie, when she got off the phone was very polite and apologetic. I was really annoyed at first but I'm so happy she handled it correctly and professionally because it completely turned my experience around. Another downfall.... my order was incorrect. The person who took my order was male. He apparently input my order as \"pizza and breadsticks\" and failed to put it in as \"pizza, breadsticks, and cinnamon sticks\" AKA the dinner box. So Cylie got the cinnamon sticks ready for me, told me it would be a slight wait, which was alright with me since it's a weekend & im just hanging out with my son not doing much. 

Not the best branch but the cashier really made my experience a lot better when it could've been the worst experience ever. Granted, my order was wrong and I had to wait a long time but customer service is a huge thing for me... so I am appreciative!"}
{"text":"Great pizza when it gets to your house. The delivery time is terrible they average 20-45 min later then the time they tell you it will be at your house.
I've called and talked to a manager when they are late and he blames the workers.  That usually is a sign of bad management, even if your team is struggling you don't throw them under the bus to the customer.  You support them and focus on making the customer happy.
We are just going to pick it up ourselves since this location is struggling to deliver within a reasonable amount of time."}
{"text":"Wow. Worst customer service ever encountered. Maybe it's policy, maybe it's laziness. Either way, Pizza Hut off the map for me."}
{"text":"Ok this is the 3rd time I have order from this location and this is the 3rd time they have messed up my order. I don't understand I order online I wait 20 mins I come in and they don't have the pizza I ordered. They have the same manager but new team members we need to do better ."}
{"text":"Disclosure: At the time of this review I own a few shares of YUM, the parent company of Pizza Hut.

We wanted a quick lunch en route to Vegas from the Grand Canyon and decided to stop by here.  Overall food was okay, and service was excellent from Lindsey, who was also the cashier.

Medium thin crust veggie pizza had good number of toppings and light on cheese and sauce so you get the crispy crunch from the crust.

The breaded wings were okay - spicy BBQ was great and had good flavor, but the honey BBQ was a little one-noted.

Still, not a bad place for a quick rest stop, given the price."}
{"text":"This pizzahut is probally the best one in town, its always clean, the employees are always nice  and the Pizza is cooked perfectlly. 

The thing I dont like aboit it os that it has a small waiting area tjat is always full."}

{"text":"late, forgot 2 liter, pizza cold and tasted terrible... 1st and last time using them."}
{"text":"One word... terrible! Nothing professional about this place accept for delivery time. The delivery man continuously knocking on my opened door, after I specifically told him I was I was grabbing my cash, and taking it upon himself to even step in my house! Then when I don't give a tip, has the nerve to give attitude. Bye! No class, no tip! Don't enter my house, especially me being a female alone, that could get you shot. Pizza hut needs to fire this individual, before they catch a lawsuit."}

{"text":"My recent experience with this location wasn't the greatest Friday I ordered a pizza and pasta and from what I recall pasta comes with breadsticks... ok cool... I showered got in pajamas made a 30m phone call when I realized I ordered food over an hour ago so I called to find out how much longer would it be for them to tell me my food was undeliverable I ask how is that when you've delivered to me before with no issues he said I know......... sooooooo because not once was my door bell rung and I was not once called which he stated \"oh we would have called whatever number was on file and read my number then asked do I still want my order......... then said it'll be there in 10m that turned into ANOTHER 30m the part that gets me is they're about 0.8 miles up the street. When the delivery man finally showed up it was an unapologetic older guy who looked lost and confused on what he was doing and not only that.... I was too hungry and pissed to realize that he didn't give me my bread sticks. :/ Some customer service..."}
{"text":"Ordered a pizza expecting 35 minute wait time.  It showed up at 11:40pm, over an hour and 40 minutes later, and was ice cold and smelled like cigarettes.  I live 3 minutes from this location.  But thankfully they gave me a $5 gift card to make up for it..."}
{"text":"One day I ordered pizza hut and after one hour and a half we called wondering where the pizza was. They said the delivery driver was on his way. After another hour we called again and found out that the pizza was delivered to the wrong place. WE NEVER GOT OUR PIZZA!   And we didn't even get a coupon for another pizza. WE GOT SCAMMED!"}
{"text":"Don't go here!!!

Not only was the pizza undercooked...as in soggy raw crust, the service was incredibly rude.  My family waited one hour and 45 minutes for this inedible garbage.

I called the location multiple times while waiting with the last call being to cancel the order.  The \"manager\" that answered not only yelled profanities at me she also hung up on me.

I went personally to the store the next day demanding a full refund which I received with multiple apologies. 

I don't care how sorry you are at the way I was treated or how crummy the product was.   I will NEVER order from this establishment again."}
{"text":"What's not to love about Pizza Hut?!

This place was wonderful! It's a small location but inside was very clean and the staff was wonderful to work with. My order was prepared correctly and it was pipping hot when I arrived. 

I look forward to ordering from here again!"}
{"text":"Way To Be on the Ball 
Pizza Hut!
Love this location. 
Ordered online using coupon which I ended up not needing. Delivery time said 40-50 minutes, arrived in absolute ***perfect*** order, in less than thirty minutes!
Driver was delightfully funny. Extra impressive attitude in 108 Summer heat! Already a bunch of stuffed faces around here."}
{"text":"I used to love Pizza Hut.  It used to be my one and only pizza place, but ever since moving into this neighborhood, I've had nothing but terrible pizza, so I switched to Papa Johns (!).  The pizza ends up really thin and greasy; there's really nothing to it.  What a waste.  Plus, they don't do the stuffed crust pizza promos that other Pizza Huts do...so, this place is just a lose-lose.  Gross, awful, and expensive.  Plus, the delivery drivers ALWAYS CALL YOU BEFORE THEY'VE ARRIVED, which means they're expecting you to meet them at the door, and they're not even there yet!  At least I don't waste money on tips?

After four months of Papa Johns, I thought to myself, \"That Pizza Hut couldn't have been THAT bad,\" so I tried it again.  Someone tell me how to get this gross, greasy taste out of my mouth.

In short, even if you like Pizza Hut, stay away.  This place is the worst Pizza Hut I've ever ordered from."}
{"text":"The young man at the counter was a 5 star! Very polite and friendly. 

But the food, wow, a negative 1. I ordered online at 10pm. The estimated time for pickup was 10:35 so I arrived about 10:30. It was waiting for me, and looked as though it had been sitting there since about 10:02.  The toppings were scant and the edges burnt, and tasted like 3 day old pizza. 

The last time I tried to order, they were out of personal pan dough. And now since I've already ordered, I can't seem to access any of the freebies I was promised for joining whatever their club is. 

I don't expect gourmet from a chain like this, but I do expect decent. This wasn't even that."}
{"text":"Not only did I wait an hour and a half for my pizzas to get delivered, they were both totally incorrect."}

The best part about my Pizza Hut experience , was the driver. He was nice and courteous. At least I know where not to order cheap pizza from"}
{"text":"The one worker (I believe she was a manager) smelled and had no teeth. Her attitude was uncalled for as well!!"}

{"text":"I read the nasty reviews but risked it anyway.  got hung up on when called for delivery but in fairness,  moments before, Cleveland had won the Pennant and everyone was excited.  placed an online order special that was promptly delivered, hot and wonderfully tasty.  thanks Hut for a good job."}
{"text":"By far one of the worse dominos in Las Vegas. I've had multiple encounters with them messing my order up. The biggest problem I had with them was when I was on my way to the store and I seen a Pizza Hut  driver driving fast as hell in my neighborhood turning onto my block. I then turned around and let the lady know that the pizza was for me and that I needed to go in and grab the money. I paid the driver the pizza fee and turned back inside to go put the pizza down. As I opened the box to grab a slice for my walk to the store I realized how awful the pizza was presented. It was as if someone  just pulled slices apart and it had a piece of onion smacked middle of the pizza. I ran outside to catch the lady but she was already off of my block. I had no phone with service  to call back so I decided to use my app and just reorder the same pizza so I can get what I paid for and I can speak with a manager. The manager (Debbie) tried telling me to pay for the pizza and she will give me $20 credit which made zero sense. I explained to her that I was not paying for the pizza and that my first order was completely messed up. She then told me that I was  not Suppose to pay for the pizza because I had $30 credited towards my account due to an order that my girlfriend and her friend had placed  a few nights before which I had no clue of. I then told her that I felt that they were stealing from me so I needed my money back. I no longer have my $30 credit because of their fuck ups. Debbie lied and said my total was $15 and some change when that was also a lie. She literally argued me down letting me know that I was lying saying my meal was only $11.70 which means I still have $17.30 on credit that she stole from me once again. Just from talking on the phone I seen that Debbie could care less about customer being satisfied. I wouldn't refer the devil to that location after 3 of of 4 orders were wrong. Shoutout to Pizza Hut on nellis and Sahara they always had my order correct ."}
{"text":"I am so against pizza hut. The pizza is bad, and I don't know when drivers stopped carrying something as simple as crushed red pepper, but I hate that. Slow service,  bad online ordering site, greasy pizza."}

{"text":"My bf and I carried out last night after going to the cardinals game and we got a large any topping pizza (supreme) with cheesy garlic knots. I really wasn't impressed the last time I ordered from them but it was getting late and they had the best deal. So we picked our food up and a blonde haired girl with glasses helped us and was super friendly we gave her a cash tip and our total was 17.26 then this morning I checked my account to see that it was charged 17.26 twice. Super annoyed about it, I called to let them know and Don or Jon Stevenson answered the phone super nice and friendly and helped me solve my problem quickly. The best customer service I've received over the phone! They not only refunded me the 17.26 back but gave me a $10 off my next purchase :) also I might add the pizza and garlic knots were super delicious!! Will be coming back based off the great deals, super tasty food and excellent service! 

Update: now I've been charged for the wrong amount. Awesome. So annoying."}

{"text":"\"Fool me once, shame on you; fool me twice, shame on me.\"

~Let me start out saying... Pizza Hut is my favorite pizza. I have eaten Pizza Hut all over the country and even used to order it when I lived in Tokyo~

Today: After a two-year boycott of this branch, I ordered again and it has been over three hours and my pizza has still not arrived. I have called the branch, who said the pizza was sent out two hours and fifteen minutes ago. When I called back, I was put on hold for twenty minutes. Time to Yelp about it and contact the national Pizza Hut hotline.

History: This branch is a sore disappointment. I ordered from them for several years, 2012-2015ish when I moved to my new house. During that time, my orders were frequently late and often incorrect. I guess I'm a glutton for punishment (actually just a Pizza Hut addict) because I really stuck with them through a bunch of bad orders. The manager/s were always very rude when I called to talk about the issues with my pizza or delivery time. They once got my pizza order wrong twice in the same order. They got it wrong, make me come to the store to pick up the corrected pizza... and that pizza was wrong too!

Advice: Stear clear. I order from Domino's now for delivery and if I want Pizza Hut, I just get it from the one in the Target in Waterfront. Update: In the end, today's pizza never arrived and no call was made from the restaurant."}
{"text":"Not one star, ZERO stars! This is legitimately the worst Pizza Hut I've ever been to in the history of pizza huts I've been to throughout the country. Why you may ask? Because I called and explained my dad had a flight to catch and that we needed the pizza to be ready upon arrival and that I wanted to dine in, the lady said oh ok no problem come on in and just ask for plates, it'll be 20 minutes. Well we showed up 25 minutes later and I'm told the pizza was just put into the oven, what? So we wait, fine. I ask for a plate, the lady at the register says I can't give you a plate you're not dining in, I say yes we are and I spoke to the person that took my order. She stares at me for a minute as though she can't figure out who would allow such a thing. She hands me two plates after more explanation, one of which is dirty - keep in mind these are paper plates. Then my dad orders a drink and I want water and she states there is no water, bottled water? No, no water. I'm absolutely mind blown.

The location was filthy, the employees have no regard for their job and quite frankly didn't want to work. I'm not sure why they're still open or even a fine in facility if they don't appreciate patrons. I will not be returning and am thankful that this is not my local Pizza Hut location, so I really won't need to return."}
{"text":"I would give negative stars if I could. I ordered a couple pizzas and some wings and the order took 2 1/2 hours to arrive. Two and a HALF HOURS!!! When it finally arrived it was cold. Not even luke warm. We called to complain and they gave us a credit but in order to use the credit we had to call in the order instead of order online. 

So we just called to use our credit. The pizza guy came and asked for the full amount...no credit was applied. He didn't even offer to call in and clear up the confusion. We sent him back with some choice words and didn't get our pizza's.  

EPIC FAIL PIZZA HUT! TWICE!

These guys are seriously operating with brainless idiots. Pretty sure they are completely stoned over there. It's a complete joke. NEVER EVER order from this place EVER!"}
{"text":"The delivery guy was great but the pizza and breadsticks were not. They barely had any cheese and it was to crispy kind of like a stale chips. maybe the cook was new our they were running out of cheese. We did not complain because we did not want to be accused of wanting free food. We never had a problem before."}
{"text":"If I could give 1/2 star or minus a star I would. We ordered a thin and crispy crust with pepperoni, mushrooms, and Italian sausage. We got home only to realize we received a thick pan crust with pepperoni, bacon, and meatballs!!! Like seriously who even orders that?? Im guessing we got someone else's pizza. The ONLY reason I would give 1/2 star is because it was ready in 16 minutes. However if I had been the person who actually ordered this pizza I would be upset because remember I said they gave us a pan crust....well it was undercooked. Too bad - I had been craving a good ol' pizza and would have loved to have this as a regular go to. If this is your only take out option you're better off with a frozen pizza from the grocery store!"}
{"text":"My sister sent me to pick up a pizza on a Friday they told her 20 minutes I went and waited my pick up time was 715 my pizza was not ready until almost 8.  This was absolutely ridiculous. If you're going to run behind that is quite alright just let us know our food won't be ready for 45 minutes. The reason for the 2 stars is because the cust. Svc.  Lady at the front was super kind to everyone and she is probably the reason they have customers. One lady they lost her orde4 and she was on a time crunch couldn't get refunded unless she sent in a form requesting a refund.  Wow.  Will never return."}
{"text":"Pizza Hut more like Pizza Butt! Hahahahhahahahahaggahahahahahhahahahahhahahhahahahahahhah"}
{"text":"First off I gotta throw da wife under the table. This was all her idea! I thought sure what the heck I suppose I will give them a shot since they have been pumping up their new hand-tossed pizza on TV.

The sauce was the only good thing on there. I ordered it online and went to pick it up. I got there and paid and then waited. After 5-7 minutes they said the pizza was made wrong and they forgot two toppings. So they tell me to wait longer as they are remaking it. Ok fine.

The pizza crust was really thin and flimsy. It also seemed undercooked. Not sure if that was because they remade the pizza or what. We also ordered extra sauce. There were areas on the pizza with no sauce.

Head this as your warning. Why don't I just stick with the pizza joints I love? Uggh! The grass ain't getting greener on the other side. It looks like an extended drought is in place for Yum! Brands, inc!!"}
{"text":"Terrible. No eye contact, hit me with the card machine and didn't apologize. Waited over half an hour in store even though we came later than what the online carry out time was. People who came after us got their pizza and left and we are still waiting. If you can, do delivery or another location."}
{"text":"Pizza is ok. Any large carry out is $10. Can't go wrong with that. It's only 8 slices I can finish one by myself. Always ready in 10mins or so. Standard pizahut pizza. The service is usually great, friendly and quick."}
{"text":"Called I an order 20 minutes be ready.  Customers before ordered over the phone as well and are still waiting. They don't know what there doing here so unorganized and poorly trained. No manager on duty! Taking my business elsewhere next time!"}
{"text":"After coming here several times, tonight was the first time they disappointed me. I ordered online so I can get the 50% off promo that's going on. When I came in to pick up my order, the cashier said they were unable to give me the 50% off. She told me it's only an online offer. I told her I did order it online. Then she said you gotta put in the code to receive it. There is no such code. She told that she still can't do it she's unable to override the transaction. And to top it off. My pizza was horrible. Very dry, hardly any sauce, and the toppings were really dry. Really bad service. If you're gonna offer a deal, stick by it."}
{"text":"I ordered the Triple Treat Box to see what it was all about. Spent about $30 total and waited the \"45 minute wait time\", fair enough. 

The delivery driver shows up, doesn't follow my instructions to CALL ME instead of knocking. 

Whatever. 

So, I take my order which was in three separated boxes. I was sort of disappointed because the advertisement showed it all in ONE box. Okay, moving on. 

I open the pizza and it's cold. COLD. Not luke warm. It's cold. It was hard and dried out with little to NO sauce as if it sat out for a long time. GROSS!!!! So obviously I'm livid and called the store. 

Some girl named \"cat\" or \"kat\" answers. I inform her that i'm highly disappointed with this situation and included all the details listed above. She tries to bribe me with a gift card off my next order. Next order? I told her I'm never ordering this food again. Her reply was \"sorry\". 

I demanded her manager and got my point across. Try #2. Let's see how this goes. I work customer service. Two can play the same game. Next attempt is corporate for me. 

Happy holidays? Hah."}
{"text":"The customer service here is horrible. I placed a carry out order online and received a call that they are no longer taking carry out orders. I was then asked if I wanted it delivered and after I agreed I was told the wait would be 4-5 hours! It's a regular Saturday night and they close in 1 hour so how is delivery time 4-5 hours exactly?! Needless to say, I just cancelled my order."}
{"text":"Just thought we'd give Pizza Hut a try...DONT!!!! ordered a medium Extravaganza..and got a flat...hand tossed few ingredients ..non tasty pizza...had to wait on extra order of my daughters so thought why get back in traffic to get our usual pizza store.. What a mistake.....we will never try that again and won't be spending that kind of money on POOR example of a Menu PIZZAs ..not even a sale or special .....learned our lesson.."}
{"text":"Disappointed AGAIN! 3rd time in a row they have been 10 mins late and pizza has been warm. Not like the warm out of the oven but warm like sitting in a car. I used to order frequently but that will stop after these last visits.  Amazing that it takes an hour to deliver and I live 5 mins away."}
{"text":"There's a young black female thats manager with too much attitude and unprofessional she need not be in Mgmt very disrespectful and dont have clue on what works in store properly in store talks down to other employees. So slow I walk in purchasing 2 medium pizza they said 15 min it tool 37 minutes never again every time I call to make complaints Megan store mgr. Never there or IF you call 800_984_8488 always busy that ghetto store needs new management the 3 men at time working so hard while the management was too busy on phone will answer phones and taking customers orders"}
{"text":"My night was ruined thanks to this Pizza Hut. I got 3 pizzas, one for my boyfriend, brother and myself; at first glance they looked great, but when my brother started eating his pizza and found a hair it made me so disgusted but I continued to eat it anyway. When I found a hair in my own separate pizza it made me absolutely sick and couldn't even finish my 2nd piece. I find it repulsive that obviously your cooks don't wear any hair nets since there were MULTIPLE HAIRS in my pizza. This was my first real meal since getting my wisdom teeth out 3 days ago so thanks for ruining that for me. Its safe to say i don't think I'll ever be ordering from this unsanitary, disgusting location again !"}
{"text":"I just moved in the area and all the Pizza Huts around be were 1-2 stars with horrible reviews. This was the only one in my area that wasn't bad so I chose to order and pick up. 
The young lady I spoke with one the phone was the same I picked my order up from, very nice and had great customer service skills. She showed me the pizza before handing it over. She asked if I needed cheese and peppers and then supplied em. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Wow!  Just ordered a carryout medium pepperoni thin crust and it was TASTY!  Not only was the crust cooked just long enough to be done..the pepp was crisp..enough cheese without ordering extra.  Of course I had to freeze some and am hoping it heats up even half as tasty and it will be a good meal.  4 me it's 4 meals and tasty...can't beat the deal.

Unfortunately I didn't get the young man's name that assisted me but he was friendly, funny and efficient.  I would recommend this particular neighborhood pizza shop without hesitation.

Thank you Pizza Hut for giving my day a pleasant ending."}
{"text":"I ordered online and was given a time to pick up my pizza.  I arrived at the right time but they said it would be about 6 minutes more.  OK, not a big deal, it was a Saturday and it looked like a lot of pizza was going out for delivery.  But 15 minutes later seemed awfully long when I have often ordered at a pizza place and got it within 15 minutes without ordering in advance.  I had a pepperoni/sausage with mushroom, green peppers, and onions.  It was OK but needed more sauce as it was a little dry.  There are just too many places to get  pizza to deal with slow and just mediocre.  Can't recommend this location."}
{"text":"This pizza hut is HORRIBLE next to my house. I order 16 peice bone out half garlic half medium..  they bring me 24 wings saying \"hey we messed up and dressed all the wings with gp here 24 wings with an 8 peice of medium\" the 8 peice is flavored with mild sauce not medium. Get the fuck outta here. Ex employee who hates bad service."}
{"text":"I would give this place ZERO stars if I could !!!! We ordered online and received an email confirmation. We were told that our food would get here at 9:58. We placed out order at 9:23. At 10:40 our food arrived and I was not happy one bit.

My wife said something to the delivery driver about how it was over 40 minutes late. She just laughed and said that they are slow. What the heck is that about?

I then try to call the store to let them know I'm not happy about the wait! First call I was on the line 10 minutes and was hung up on. Second call I was on the line for thirty minutes and I finally gave up! Not before o took a screenshot of my wait ! Grrr!

Needless to say, I will never order form pizza hit ever again! Crappy customer service! I can't even do an online complaint on their website, as it keeps directing me to the mobile site !"}
{"text":"This was our first time Pizza Hut here in Arizona the pizza is Justin even tastes like pizza we landed throwing both pizzas or mine and my wife stomach hurts very much my granddaughter it wouldn't even eat it because it didn't taste good this is the worst Pizza I have ever ever had your place is dirty your staff doesn't give a damn how it looks and we wouldn't never go back I wouldn't even give it her one rating that's how bad you place is the outside his deteriorating and it seems like you don't care I would never recommend anybody to go there whatsoever if anything I would tell them to go to the pizza place down the road a little bit in Buckeye the ratings are five stars your say nothing"}
{"text":"These people are idiots, called 3 times and got disconnected all 3 times, asked about using coupons and they had no idea what we were talking about, will not be ordering from here again,  dominoes down the street from here is way better in customer service"}
{"text":"App is always down, tried to order online and that was also down, so called and it was more than double the price! Wouldn't honor any pricing. Never order from hem again."}
{"text":"Ordered online. One pizza was right, the other not even close. Ordered a supreme pan pizza well done and got a cheese pizza half done. This was their second chance. Never again. Also, 
their pizza is just not good anymore."}
{"text":"Ordered a pizza and breadsticks.  The pan pizza was flat and doughy.  The breadsticks were not seasoned.  Overall it was a pretty terrible meal."}
{"text":"The pizza was inedible. Spent 40 dollars and had to throw it out. Don't even want to call because they'll give me a credit, and I'm never eating there again. Any Pizza Hut. It actually put me off pizza for life."}
{"text":"Omg!!!! 

You have to order \"Hut Favorite\" as your crust!!! You'll thank me later. I ordered online and found out that there are different crusts, other than cheese crust, that you can choose free of charge! Same thing goes with breadsticks! I'm not sure if hey advertise this on tv or in store but they should! 

I live less than a five minute drive away for delivery. There's been a time where the bill was $13... Have him a $20 and he asked if we needed change back. That's not ok. That's RUDE! I work in the industry and I would never say that! I'm a tipper, even though I'm getting charged $2 because I'm too lazy to put on clothes and drive around he corner to pick it up myself, I still tip $2. At times I feel that it's not good enough for them which is very poor customer service."}
{"text":"Yesterday was my first time here. I did carry out, when I got to the car the kids wanted a slice. The pizza was not fully sliced through. I took it back and asked them to re-slice it. As we are driving home the kids realized that the pizza was not how we had ordered it. We asked for light sauce and got the opposite. Plus the slices were still not fully cut. Not a happy camper."}
{"text":"Ordered from here a few times now. Seems like all the toppings aren't always included and they don't always bring things you ask for. Also I had jalapeños added and they included a stem"}
{"text":"Robin and her team are the best!!!!  Everytime I've been to this location, the service has been great. Today I had an issue with my order, called the store and Robin corrected the issue immediately.... Thanks for the great customer service."}
{"text":"Pizza Hut just isn't what it once was, at least for me.  I remember coming to Pizza Hut for B-day parties all the time as a kid and loving the Pizza as well as the salad bar they used to have.  Now, they no longer have a Salad bar (at this location), and you have to look hard to find where the menu is even at.  The fod was still 'OK', but again not the Pizza Hut I grew up liking much more.  Perhaps my expectations have changed now that I am much older, but it seems like I can get better pizza at so many other places.  The service was pretty good and the place was clean, but I expect better pizza and better wings.  The wings here suck!!  I don't mind the boneless, but traditional wings are crap, they taste soggy.  I prefer a little bit of crunch to the skin, not much, but just a little would be nice."}
{"text":"I can't put half a star!!!! Ordered two medium pizzas with extra cheese and pepperoni and it had less cheese than when you get a regular pizza"}
{"text":"Great food, friendly staff and they were to my door in about 20-25min, not bad at all. I would definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"We have never had a bad experience. We have ordered pick up and delivery and they are always fast and our food is hot and fresh. Employees are always pleasant as well"}
{"text":"I'll keep it simple. Didn't expect much from Pizza Hut. We order from here fairly regularly since it's close to the apartment. Three of five times we have ordered recently have resulted in phone calls stating they are out of what we ordered. How exactly does a pizza joint *run out* of pizza?!?! This wasn't on a holiday or near closing..and it's happened three separate times. Don't waste your time here, try a local place instead!"}
{"text":"I usually hate going here but the guy Adam really helped us out and was very knowledgeable about what he gave us.  he recommended the wings we ordered and even the pizza!!!!!  Great service  Adam M. rung us up!  Just an all around good guy! And the pizza was yummy!!  Thx for the terrific customer service and professional pizza recommendation Adam!!!  5stars!!!"}
{"text":"We called them to order a medium pizza with extra cheese, and 3 other items.  They quoted us a tab of $25 plus a delivery charge.

We did not order a steak or a lobster dinner; it was plain 'ol pizza.

Although we have ordered from this Pizza Hut in the past it is now on our \"do not use\" list.  Instead, we called Papa Johns and got the same thing for $10 and no delivery charge.  We did give the driver a nice tip which was deserved.

There are many, many choices for pizza delivery."}
{"text":"UPDATE****
Was just informed when the second pizza got here that it's a visiting MANAGER making them today...aren't managers supposed to be proficient in all areas of their business?? Inexcusable my rating will not be changing 

I don't know how hard it is to put pizza topping on half a pizza but they can't figure out how to....ended up with topping in only two slices. Pizza is thin and crunchy only edible part is the crust. Offered to send us a new one it 15 dollar credit....will change my review if the new pizza is the way it's supposed to be. Very inconsistent."}
{"text":"I have ordered from this pizza hut four separate times in the past year, and they have always given me good quality food and I have never had a problem, until now. I did an  online order for two large three topping pizzas, than added breadsticks and soda for an additional 5 bucks. 
While there delivery was fast, the size of the pizza's I received was shocking. They gave me two mediums instead of larges, and when I called them to replace the mediums they said that they definitely gave me two larges. 
I used to work at a pizza place and this is not a large. Well, I went and measured the pizzas while I was waiting for the larges and my measuring tape said 12\". I went to pizza hut's website where it says that there mediums are in fact 12\".
Well, when they brought the new ones they were the exact same size. The delivery guy (who was very nice) told me that the manager said that this was their large, I told them this in fact was 12\" when I measured it and he said that a 12\" is a large....ugh...well, on the bright side they told me to keep the first two pizza's so we now have four mediums, so that's cool! lol. 

Just be careful what you order from here, usually they are good, but this whole experienced kinda does not make me want to come back. Also, I am never that person who complains, I am actually an easy laid back person, but when I spend 30 bucks I expect more then just  mediums."}
{"text":"Order is not ready at the promise times. Took an additional 20 minutes. Phone rang nonstop during pick up at the store. No one answered it. Staff did not apologize for the delay in the food. Take your business elsewhere.

The food is decent for the price, if you take advantage of the online coupons. I listened to a person place an order and the employee not give them a deal package because the person did not ask for it. Bad customer service"}
{"text":"Ordered pizza and garlic knots tonight from them online. Pizza arrived in a timely manner and the driver was pleasant. We started to eat and the pizza wasn't very warm, the cheese in the middle hadn't even completely melted down. My wife suggested we call and complain, so I called in. The person who answered the phone (Nick), said he was the manager and proceeded to argue with me that he personally recalled my order and did the quality check on it him self. Then proceeded to tell me I was full of it, but he would send another pizza. I told him I wasn't interested in having it replaced at this point and he told me that's what he will do and hung up. 

I will be contacting the store owner Monday."}
{"text":"Man this place needs some updates reviews! I've been steadily visiting this place often being as I just moved over in this area, & I gotta tell you this place is off the hook! Pizza is always hot & delicious always accurate. I got pizza tonight & I missed the galls name but I order pepperoni lovers (extra pep & extra cheese) ... MMMM she made some delicious pizza I am looovin in. She sure made sure the $2 extra dollars for extra cheese was well worth it. Excellent service even though I did order 15 min before closing time, no attitudes or crap pizza. Keep up the good service, I usually get pizza here with my boyfriend 3x a week, which is $30 every time. Keep the good pizza comin, & I'll keep the money flowin!!"}
{"text":"Great pizza. Great service. 
Tried this location for the lunch buffet, delicious."}
{"text":"You'd think they'd all be the same, or similar.

I ordered for delivery online on their site. The guy gets here 45 mins later (no biggie there, if you're busy, you're busy... but you did say it was only going to be 30, this is NOT the reason for the bad rating though), and calls me from the street. I can't hardly understand him so I tell him where the entrance to my apt complex is and give him the gate code. 

He insists I come out to the street and get it and says a bunch of stuff I can't understand. 

So I get dressed and walk all the way out there (it's a pretty big complex). 

I ask him why he didn't just bring it to my apt and he's saying something about he's NOT ALLOWED to come in here, like our complex has been blacklisted or something... lmao.

Look, it's a bad neighborhood, I'm not going to lie. But you're really going to charge me extra to have it \"delivered\", then still make me get dressed and walk all that way to get it? If you're \"not allowed\" to come in here, then how come it was never a problem in the past? I've had it delivered to my door here several times this year. 

AND TO TOP IT OFF,  IT WAS COLD. 

Last time I ever order from them again."}
{"text":"I only order take out here since the dine in is horrible. Every time we go for it the servers take forever and never get things right (even when your the only customers in the entire dining room). It's better to cut your losses and take out the pizza, for some reason it comes out good that way lol"}
{"text":"Dont order take out! I thought I ordered my pizza off of the Pizza Hut website, but what I got was NOT it. Pizza Hut normally has a crust that you want to eat, this pizza was dry and greasy. How they accomplished that, I don't know, but I was starving after waiting an hour so I ate it."}
{"text":"Dear Pizza Hut,

Thank you for that $hitty a$$ed cold pizza you delivered 45 minutes late.   At least it can be used to keep people alive.   I guess."}
{"text":"Ordered a pizza Saturday April 2nd 2016 and our pizza never came. Called 5 times with no answer. Unbelievable!"}
{"text":"Arguably the worst food spot in general I have ever been to.  When you pre order food 8 hours in advance and it is still 20-30 minutes late.  It absolutely makes no sense.  No management around to help.  Nothing was done about it and the food was late to the event it was needed at.  Never again. I would rather drive 10 miles out of my way then go to this place again."}
{"text":"Domino convert here. I've been disappointed with dominos in the past so I ordered Pizza Hut online tonight. I had specific instructions which they followed and the order was correct and on time. Can't ask for more than that."}
{"text":"Again they did not disappoint. I ordered pizza and wings and both was very good. Was able to track my order on my phone and get a text letting me know they where on there way. Was able to pay with app  and added tip at the door delivery so I didn't have to worry about having cash on me. 
Happy customer!"}
{"text":"Took 3 hours for one pizza to be delivered. I have never in my life waited that long for any food to be delivered. Also, they wouldn't answer the phone and hung up on me every time they did answer. Worst pizza hut experience ever."}
{"text":"Over the weekends I was too lazy to leave the house and wanted quick food delivery.  I ordered from their app and it arrived rather fast. There was no crushed red pepper and parmesan cheese that was brought with the pizza. The delivery driver stated that you have to request it upon ordering it online. This is a crock. I don't order pizza to be delivered that often,  but it should be an automatic condiment for the pie. I also ordered chicken wings and there was NO RANCH delivered with the wings either. WTH is that!?  It is apparent they are doing the bare minimum to provide \"customer service\" when delivering their food. I will not be ordering from them again."}
{"text":"I don,t know what happened to Pizza Hut or if I just got some bad pizzas. I ordered thin crust which doesn't mean thin toppings. I can't even taste the bacon on it.I ordered 2 pizzas and both are the same. For example, one pizza had sausage onion tomatoes and black olives. There were a few slices that had no onion. Also the crust was tough. It's supposed to be crispy. Won't be ordering again. I posted a pic of one slice."}
{"text":"Tasty but inconsistent Pizza Hut location. Every time, the food has been delivered very fresh and service friendly. The problem is that our order almost always has something incorrect. Tonight, for example, we were missing balsamic drizzle, dressing for the wings and spicy pepper crust seasoning on the other pizza. 

Here, the hand tossed and stuffed crust pizzas are the best. Pan pizza is not truly a pan(thick, raised edge). Don't bother with pretzel crust(they just sprinkle a ton of salt on regular crust). The cheddar, hut and asiago crusts are awesome. The new red  cherry peppers are awesome! Slightly spicy and sweet and we pair those with spinach. Ask for spinach under cheese or they plop it raw on top. The breaded, bone in or the bone out wings are great with either honey BBQ or garlic parm sauces. Just make sure they give you ranch or blue cheese. Everything is better with ranch. :-)"}
{"text":"If I could give less than 1 star, I would. Very real possibility this may be the worst Pizza Hut on the planet. The place is filthy, trash all over the place and just looks run down. Pretty sure it wouldn't pass a health inspection. 

To begin, they messed up the first pizza. Ok, it's Pizza Hut, I don't have astronomical expectations.  My order was for pizza, wings, and cheese sticks. Really, my entire order should have been remade, but I was generous and took the wings and the cheese sticks home to my hungry family, and was told that it would be \"ten minutes\" until my pizza was ready. I get back to the restaurant and THEY HAVENT EVEN STARTED MAKING MY PIZZA YET.  I was literally standing in the lobby waiting and watching my pizza sit @ the end of the oven while the cook is making some other order. So after waiting twice as long for my \"fixed\" pizza, I take it home only to find out...it's wrong again. I guess I shouldn't be shocked. 

No sense of urgency, no sense of concern that they're not doing their jobs. Customers came in to dine-in; employees were out smoking. No rush to get back inside, wash their hands, and take care of the customers. Staff seemed more interested in bickering and blaming each other for the restaurants shortcomings than doing what needed to be done. I'll avoid this place at all costs, and you should too. Don't be surprised if you see this place show up on the failed inspections report."}
{"text":"Worst service possible
I ordered pizza for a corporate event ordered it 90 mins early and it showed up. 45mins late the person on the phone was rude I complained to corporate got an email and never heard back after my reply 
Crappy service cold pizza and rude service 
I will never order from this location and will look at a different pizza company
Pizza Hut you failed and reading other review I am not alone"}
{"text":"This is my choice for pizza for our family get-togethers.  We typically order large pizzas, all different toppings, and they're almost always ready on time and the price is reasonable.  Delivery is always on time.  We especially love the custom-made chicken alfredo pizza.  NOTE:  Don't be upset if they are a little behind on filling orders.  I know the management, and they run a tight ship and sell A TON of pizza at this location.  Occasionally, they do get backed up like on Super Bowl Sunday, or similar times.  The reason for this is that they have sooo many happy customers."}
{"text":"I wish I took a picture of the pizza. I ordered two pizza pies and breadsticks. Only one pie delivered, they said they'd re deliver the other pie, which they never did. The pizza was cold and it just looked ridiculous. It was a stuffed crust pizza and it was lopsided. As I said I should have taken a picture. I literally cannot believe how horrible that place is."}
{"text":"So this is the second time we've ordered from this specific location. The first time they screwed up our pizza completely. Wrong ingredients on the wrong side, & didn't give us the garlic crust we asked for, good news is they gave us a $14 credit. Today we ordered half cheese half pepperoni that part they got right but AGAIN they forgot our garlic crust. Will not be ordering from this location anymore."}
{"text":"I'm so upset with the service they delivered to me. I called in my order and the lady told me it will be done in about 15 minutes. I didn't believe that so I gave it an extra 10 minutes before I drove to get my food. I get there and they tell me they don't have my order. I gave the lady my number, she then tells me someone called from your number to cancel that order. I'm immediately upset because it would've been impossible for someone to cancel MY order from MY phone when I'm the only one who had my phone. All she offered was a 20% discount which I felt was bogus because I over heard her and the rest of the crew talking and someone said no one called to say that. I will never go back to this location again."}
{"text":"This is by far the best pizza hut in Calgary , and the only old style full restaurant left. They don't chintz out on the cheese and the crust is just right. They are usually understaffed but the staff there always do the best they can to give good service."}
{"text":"They delivered my food cold, 30 mins after the  driver Logan had dispatched from the store 3 mins away, according to manager Christian. I live on shady timber, right behind the Walmart/pizza hut and Christian the manager on duty informed me he would not tell the drivers where to go first."}
{"text":"Seems weird to review a Pizza Hut...because, well...it's Pizza Hut.  But I've gotten delivery three times in the last month or so and felt like it was deserving of a rating at least.  I love the convenience of online ordering.  We always customize our pizzas and each time they have been 100% correct and cooked perfectly.  Also, the pizza (and wings, breadsticks, etc) have been HOT and the 2 liters are COLD - seems like a no-brainer, but not too many delivery places have that down.  The delivery folks are super friendly (even in the presence of my yapping little wiener dog) and every time they have delivered on time or early.  We did take-out a while back too, and the folks in the store were awesome.

For a national chain (pizza no less) where your success is based mostly on low prices and location, I have to say the customer service here is turned up a notch.  It's now our go-to place for cheap pizza delivery (oh and it really tastes pretty good too!)"}
{"text":"I have had countless MAJOR problems with Pizza Huts' website. (Its awful), but the staff at this location have always made the website nightmare more palatable, particularly Travis.

If it were not for the great staff, I would forgo his pizza altogether because of the online ordering stress. 

Thanks staff!"}
{"text":"This pizzahut gets a zero..I walk in n no one comes out to d counter..I had to call out saying Hellllo? Finally a young  guy comes out who seems out of it or high on something..acting numb or it was that he didn't want to b bothered with me..he takes my chicken wing order of 16piece wing order of 5pieces Honey BBQ n d rest Garlic Parmesan.. Close 2almost 15min later the guy comes back out asking \"what was d flavor of wings I wanted?\" I told him again he repeats d order. A few mins he comes out w/d wings, opens d box very quickly saying these r ur wings n closes d boxes with me barely getting a glimpse. I decided to open d box myself..d order was d opposite of what I had ask for..in the box was 5pieces of the Garlic Parmesan n d rest were the honey BBQ..I ask him, \"what happen d order is wrong, its d opposite of what I had ask for?\" He tells me well..it wld take another 10mins to fix it..adding that they really don't take  orders of 5of this flavor n d rest of the other..etc\" I took it but..I was upset it was wrong..n felt it was done on purpose. Once home it turns out dat d Garlic Parmesan wings had no garlic flavor just a buttery greasy taste...they were tasteless, the honey BBQ were better..I will not b ordering frm this Pizza-hut ever again. Horrible place..bad serve.."}
{"text":"Yup, this location still deeply sucks!
Would you please go out of business already so I can get delivery from another location where they actually give a crap and put the slightest bit of effort into making a pizza?
Please everyone, do NOT order or buy anything from this store so they can finally close down and not to be the store that we are forced to get delivery from at Yonge and Sheppard!
There's another one right up the street that is much much better, go there instead."}
{"text":"This review and it's ratings are mainly from one so called \"Manager.\" I used to do carryout from this location probably 1-2 times each month, no longer. The last time I was in, I ordered online like I always do, and try and be there when the expected time tells me order will be ready. I showed up 10 mins after the expected time. 

The young woman took my order out of the waiting oven thing to show me the pizza and wings I ordered. After she very quickly opened the wings and shut them I opened them again to find my wings with about as much bbq sauce you get from one small packet spread out over 14 wings. I asked her if she could please put more sauce on my wings as they barely had any. She told me I would have to pay for it. I told her that every other time I get my wings they are SOAKED in sauce, and I have never had a problem. She then said it there was enough sauce on them, had I picked up my order on time. At first I wanted to get very upset and tell her she is out of line, I am a customer and if I want to show up 40 mins late to pick up MY order I am able to, and I am the CUSTOMER, you have to be taught not to argue with who helps pay your wages. But instead I just asked to speak with a manager. She must have just been promoted recently because she couldnt wait to say, \"I AM A MANAGER!\" to which I said, ok, this is unacceptable, I show up 10 mins late for my order and there is hardly any sauce on any of the wings, this has to be fixed. She then acted like she was doing me an act of god favor by saying, \"OK, this time I will add the sauce at no charge. She was very young, (under 23) plain, short, and hair in a pony tail. The same girl was asking other co workers how to fix my order on the register a month prior, funny she must have been doing something right to get promoted to being a MANAGER so soon! LOL."}
{"text":"Ordered online and it said one and a half hour delivery time. I am 1 mile away. Hmm. I wish the website told me when i picked the store or before clicking the place my order button. Anyways, called the store and asked to cancel the order and they promptly did. End of story."}
{"text":"Not sure why all the bad reviews. I've been ordering pizza from this location for a decade and have never had a problem."}
{"text":"Wow, what a disappointment. Ordered pizza because they are the only ones that deliver downtown. Took 2 hours to get here, ordered \"double\" toppings, but hardly got any. Pizza was COLD, didn't get extra sauce side I ordered. What a disaster! Try somewhere else."}
{"text":"This place has officially the worse pizza ever! On top of that they have bad service as they would not bring me a new pizza even though it was WAY undercooked and suggested that I could speak to the manager until Monday. Please don't bother going to this location"}

{"text":"omfg. second review ever and only because i am so mad right now.

i have tried again and again to give this place a chance and they have failed me every time.

coming from a morning cook at a Pizza hut in utah i can understand how sometimes a mess up occurs, but when it's repeatedly there is no excuse.

firstly, my pizza was cold (I CARRIED OUT TOO HOW DOES IT GET COLD IN THE WARMER???) and had barely any pizza sauce, the toppings were sparse and the wings were so soggy i couldn't stand eating them. it's one ladle of sauce per 8 wings which is enough to coat the wings but not remove the crispy-ness. ugh. so done giving them a chance.

save yourself from horrible pizza and order some place else. 

(if i could give this negative stars i would)"}
{"text":"Terrible customer service.  Was told it would be 4 hours for a delivery.  Call Marcos pizza best customer service in town and fastest delivery anywhere"}
{"text":"I ordered the pizza with bbq sauce instead of the regular. Tell me why I get a pizza with the sauce on the side and the pizza was completely dry. Also the guy that delivered even tried coming in my house and asked if he can smoke weed. Foreal this is the 3rd time this has happened. Thank god I moved!"}
{"text":"The best Pizza Hut we've ever been. The manager is super nice and the pizzas are amazing!"}
{"text":"First, I cannot believe that there is a category specifically for chicken wings.  But I guess there's enough people who love their wings and places that serve them to warrant it.

Second, why is Pizza Hut trying to market this place as a separate entity?  I mean they share the same location, phone number, and workers.  There's no need for the charade.

But the thing is the wings here are pretty good.  I don't know what exactly made them so tasty (I may have been half starved or buzzed or both) but I'll give it to them.  You got your pizza, your brew, and must have the wings to complete the third tier of the ultimate greasy diet. 
Mmmmm grease.

It's too bad it took forever to get delivered.

{"text":"I've owned my house in their delivery area for 5 years I've ordered from them at least once a month for 3 years they still call me telling me they are confirming my first time order every time. When I've went in the employees where making Mormon Jokes right in front of me and I happen to be Mormon. They never deliver on time and the place when I've gone in is very dirty and the food handlers I've seen touch their face then the pizza. I only still order from here because there aren't many options in this area. Worst Pizzahut I've ever encountered."}
{"text":"I'm with Gabe A. who commented a few minutes ago. We literally just had the same experience w/ our delivery & also speaking to \"Nick\". The manager who didn't seem to care at all. (Mind you, there's no way I want a pizza replaced & sent, I know what people do.) I simply wanted the manager to know that what we had ordered & paid for, was not what was delivered. He said (big sigh) \"yeah, you're like the 3rd or 4th person to call in about this. Do you have the ticket # because my driver isn't back yet, so I have no idea which order you are. I'll try to figure out what's going on. Do you want a new pizza or I can give you store credit...\"
We have quite a few places to choose from here in surprise, for pizza. For a quick, easy weekend pizza fix, cmon! Will NEVER ever order from there again."}
{"text":"8206 Providence Rd Ste 1600, Charlotte NC 28226 This complaint is for the store at the  Arboretum.  I ordered online at 830pm.  I called them about 10pm and they said my order would leave the store soon.They said it was backed up because it was a Friday.  I told her it was Thursday, not Friday. Then about 1030pm the lady arrived and she only had one of our 2 pizzas.  She said oh no, I will be back in ten minutes.  Then I called the store about 1030 and they said she had left, but she never showed up at our house.  Finally at 11:15 I called the store and talked to a man and told him we were going to bed. So we never did get the second pizza & the first one was 1 hour and a half late. They did say they would give me a credit, but how do I know?"}
{"text":"Absolutely the worst customer service ever. After 3 failed attempts I am giving up they never come on time when you when you pick it up the order is wrong everything is left off when you finally get your pizza over an hour and a half later it is cold as smashed even though you gave a driver a $5 tip I've had enough. I then call the manager and they just keep hanging up on me 11 times they do not care. do not order from them do not tip them that you horrible horrible work. Fire these rude ungrateful employees please."}
{"text":"All I can say is wow. They sent me a raw pizza, had me talk to three different men who were completely rude. Refused to send me a new pizza or credit my account. I am writing a letter to corporate, filing a complaint with the BBB, because sending raw food to customers who are pregnant is FUCKING UNACCEPTABLE!  

Way to go Pizza Hut - hiring unprofessional, sexist pigs, who laugh at women and ridicule them for being pregnant. I have never in my life been spoken to like that and the sick part was the other employees were laughing in the background. Absolutely disgusting!"}
{"text":"Pizza was ready quickly but that was about the best thing about our order. Pizzas lacked enough sauce and was doughy. Chincy amount of toppings too. Probably will be some time before I get Pizza Hut again."}

{"text":"If you don't order ahead of time, the food is fine (as far as typical chain pizza delivery).  The low rating is because the occasions I've tried ordering ahead of time, so dinner gets delivered after work, the food has arrived lukewarm.  It pretty clearly was made too far in advance then just sits somewhere.  My pizza was basically room temperature and the fries I ordered were limp and soggy."}
{"text":"Ordered my pizza online and went to pick it up and they put the wrong toppings on it and I said it was the wrong topping and the guy acted like I was an idiot and didn't know what I was doing. I usually eat dominos but we wanted something different. Prob won't go back here for a while."}
{"text":"WTF I ordered a pizza at 9:30 it's almost 11:00 and it still isn't here. At least call and let someone know that you won't be able to deliver."}
{"text":"Since the location we originally ordered from closed this has been the location that will delivery to us. The last time we ordered 48 wings and received only 20 some wings. We called and they were apologetic and immediately replaced the order and credited the full total of the order because of the inconvenience.

It's been awhile since we ordered but we did tonight to have the exact same experience. Ordered 48 wings and we received 28. We called the location and was first told it was impossible that we didn't get all the wings. I told the Assistant Manager (she's an ignorant piece of work) that I had actually counted the wings because when I received them from the delivery guy I even said this wasn't the correct quantity. She said it would be a hour before they could replace the order. It only took about 35 minutes to receive the first order. Basically, there was no rush to fix the problem, no apology, and she actually thought the situation was funny. We decided that they could come pick up their 28 wings and give us our money back. The response was that we would have to come into the location because their system cannot do credits because it's too old. 

We drove the 6 miles to return the order and get the refund simply because of crappy customer service. When the assistant manager was giving the credit she stated \"the wings are so small now from the manufacturer that they fill up the container.\" WHAT??!!! So she is basically saying regardless of quantity you only get half an order anyway? Ridiculous. 

They obviously do not know how to count since it is clearly obvious that 28 wings looks completely different from 48 wings.

Stay away from this place, and if you order wings make sure you count them because if not you probably didn't get everything you paid for.

We really enjoy Pizza Hut wings but I'd rather drive 20 miles for those wings than deal with these people ever again. Counting...it's learned prior to preschool...smh"}

{"text":"Ordered the special medium any way, buy 2 for $6.99 each.  Sounded like a good deal.
Not so much - undercooked, very little cheese.  When I placed the order via phone they acted like they had no idea of the coupon I was trying to use.

Took the survey on the back to get $10 off a $20 order, thought I would give them a second chance.  NOPE  Code not valid at either Pizza Hut at this location or near work.  

Won't be going back there again."}

{"text":"I have had delivery from this place on multiple occasions and it always takes them at least 30 minuets to get to my dorm room even though we are literately five minuets down the boulevard from them. Last time I called for delivery they didn't have a driver so I had to go and get it myself. The most recent occasion of our bout with the delivery from Pizza Hut I ordered a serving of cheesy bread and an order of regular bread sticks, so I could meet the delivery minimum of ten dollars. The driver came about 40 minuets later with only the order of cheesy bread. He said he \"forgot\" the other order of bread sticks and had to go back. Nine minuets later I receive a call from Pizza Hut saying that the order of bread sticks were not on my receipt and they wanted me to pay AGAIN for the food I had already paid for and not received. I told them I had left my credit card in the room as I sat outside in the cold to wait. I currently am STILL waiting for the food I ordered about an hour ago. I would not order from here if you are hungry at the moment of ordering, or even if you want it in fifteen minuets from now for a party. You are going to have a way better chance going to Pizza Roma. The food is better there anyway."}

Waited 20 minutes and got them and they were all wrong again. They said 20 min and we will make again. STILL wrong!! I asked for a refund after waiting 2 hours for food at least they did that. I will never go here again. I'll drive a little farther and go to one on Roosevelt."}
{"text":"Ok. So let's start with the fact that I have been ordering from this place for at least 3 years. And I order in spurts cuz sometimes I'm lazy and pizza delivery is easy. Anyways, in the past 6 months I have had nothing but issues with this place. From the pizza being cold, to it being 45min late or to tonight's issue of never being delivered. Seriously? Now, I could have understood if there was an issue, but I called once it was 30 min late and they said oh it's there just for me to call another 10 min later to be told a story of how the guy couldn't get to my apt but 1st I was told they went to the wrong address, then they tried calling me 30 min before when the pizza was supposed to be delivered but my phone never rang. If you're going to BS me at least keep your story straight... don't bother with this place. I know I'm done."}
{"text":"Great pizza everytime! Location appears to be much cleaner then other locations. I will continue to use this pizza Hut no matter how far I have to drive."}
{"text":"bad experience at this location time and time again. if you're willing to pay $20+ on 1 pizza with no toppings (hence, no flavour) on it, this is the place with you. even after advising the employee about my prior bad experience and asking for the pizza to be generously topped, i received a pizza with double the regular crust size and not enough cheese to even contain the sauce. if you want a decent pizza joint within ajax, try pizza depot or even pizza pizza (rossland). you get what you ask/pay for."}
{"text":"Pizza is great here ! The service is good too ! And the delivery is timely. I think last time I ordered my food came in less than thirty minutes . 

I love Pizza Hut so I really have no complaints ! I will definitely order from this location again . 

They also always have great deals and coupons available ."}
{"text":"This location is terrible. Once I had to reheat the pizza when I got home just to eat it and I live only 2 miles or so from the location. The crust was breaking apart underneath the pizza. I called and they did compensate for the pizzas and the next time I went I didn't have to pay. Now this time I ordered online and 30 minutes after it said my order would be ready my husband was still waiting on the wings. So that means the pizza isn't going to be fresh. My husband says we're never ordering from this location again."}
{"text":"Very rude manager at this location. Have you ever learned customer service you little- ugh, Ive never been so insulted, i just wanted pizza!"}
{"text":"Food is better than any other local pizza place, including other Pizza Huts. We drive an extra 15 minutes from home for our pizzas because the employees are alway so nice and helpful here!!7!"}

{"text":"Sloppy attitude from the staff, very lackluster service. Placed my order online at around 2:00 PM for a 5:00 PM pick up. Wasn't ready. Really? People that put there order in as I was walking in, received theirs before mine. Very annoying. Won't be back."}
{"text":"Worst experience I have ever had in customer service.  They quoted 1 hour for delivery and it took 2 and a half.  I didn't mind waiting extra it's just the fact they lied constantly on the phone.  1st call was 1 hour and 25 in and they said it was out for delivery and will be there within 15 minutes.  2nd call was 2 hours in and the ignorant gentlemen told me it's not him fault they are not there.  3rd call I tried refunding my money because the pizza showed up literally ice cold.  Horrible service, horrible pizza and most importantly, horrible people working for them.  This place should be ashamed of themselves"}
{"text":"If I could give zero stars I would. I live 5 minutes away and I am usually waiting 90 minutes for delivery. I always have to call them and ask what is taking so long. A few times I called no one picked up the phone at the restaurant. Never ordering from here again."}
{"text":"I ordered thin crust and wings extra crispy for pickup. What confused me is in ordered online  and was told my food was ready but when I got there I was told it wasn't. Also my first and last name was in  this big computer screen announcing my order was ready... I didn't like that. Anyway my pizza was not cooked all the way and the cheese and sauce seemed cold yet supposedly it wasn't done yet when I first came in. Also they gave me boneless wings which I called and complained and they just kept telling me to bring them back. Just Super annoying  when they mess your order up and then offer no resolution."}
{"text":"I like pizza. I don't eat it often though. I like to get away from the chain food producers in many cases and find independent local businesses for pizza generally no matter where ever I live. However no one does a Pan Pizza like Pizza Hut! So I often crave the Pan Pizza crust Supreme Pizza and when I go for one or have one delivered, I am never disappointed. The crust is always consistent as are the multiple toppings I so enjoy. And i so appreciate that about Pizza Hut, which I can't say the same of other national pizza chains."}
{"text":"I absolutely hate this Pizza Hut but since I live in the area I have no other choice. The service slow, my pizza would sometimes be half cooked and the service is horrible. Make sure when you order explain fully in exact details of how you want your pizza. On a positive note order in the day between 11am-4 you might have a chance your pizza might be perfect"}
{"text":"I always order via the Pizza Hut iPhone app & use the drive-thru for pickup. I've never has a bad experience. Pizza / wings are always perfect!"}
{"text":"When you go to this restaurant you know the service is not going to all that great and that it will probably be super slow. Sadly, poor service here is a given. The pizza, though, is pretty consistent and the kids like it. I was here on a Sunday afternoon and we were the only ones in the dining room. The employees behind the counter were making so much noise, talking extremely loudly and even cussing. We could not make conversation at our table. It was beyond rude. 
I let the company know and did not hear back from them until I reached out a second time. Now that I have reached out I am getting spammed by them. Repeatedly. It seems as though the foundation of poor customer service extends to the marketing team  and corporate office as well. 
I expect very little from this restaurant but this visit was even worse than usual. I expect to be able to talk to my family and not to have my young kids exposed to that type of language."}
{"text":"The driver is super nice and friendly. The lady who works at the location needs to be fired, and she needs to find a job in a facility that doesn't rely on customer service. She is so incredibly cranky and rude."}

I get home and open the box it locked like soggy chicken wings in a puddle of sauce and it was barely flavored. Ruined my chicken wing craving at pizza hurt for life . Do not waste your money on wings here your better off going to wing stop. Horrible quality"}
{"text":"This place is 0-3. They are at least consistent in messing up every order I have ever ordered from them. Whether it's shorting us on the sauce we ordered and paid for, or when they completely forgot the sauce and when they brought it, it was ice cold. Woo hoo! Thank you for the great customer service and guest recovery. Guess that was some sort of retaliation for calling in the complaint. This time, they messed up the pizza order and I am debating if it is even worth calling in the complaint. At least the delivery guys are nice. That's about the only thing this Pizza Hut has going for them."}
{"text":"Just ordered a pizza about 8:08. ETA 9:05. 
9:20 comes up.  I end up calling the store because they're late.  I told the guy who answered the phone that I was enquiring about my order.  He responds with, \"why? Is it late?\" In a rude manner. I said yes and gave him my information.  He looks up my order and rudely responds with, \"chill out bro. It just left at 9:04. So, just chill out. It'll get there. Chill\". 

How the heck can you tell someone to chill out? Not ordering from this location again if this is they type of employees they hire."}
{"text":"As a precious yelper states, the wait time here is horrible. If I wanted to wait 45+ minutes for a pizza, I wouldn't wait in store. I'd have it delivered to the house. On top of that; every time we order a large pizza with half pepperoni and half cheese, they make the half cheese portion considerably smaller. Maybe 1/8 of a pizza. Horrible."}
{"text":"The last 3-4 times we have been here the breadsticks are always burnt!!! They are dark brown... that is not what is shown in the picture and none of the other Pizza Huts have this problem. Also the pizza is either burnt or undercooked. I think the management has changed and the new employees I see there probably aren't trained well."}
{"text":"Placed an order online, since there is no warning saying how long it could take, you don't find out until after the order is placed. Not only was I told it would take an hour and a half to have my pizza delivered, it still is not here and it's been another 40 minutes past the time it was supposed to be here. When I called to figure out where my order was, I was rudely told, yours is up next, so I'm guessing my cooked pizza has been sitting around for an hour or so. The girl who answered the phone told me reason for the delay is they are short drivers and that they can't take the time to let people know that it will be longer than expected.  Great customer service! (Please take note to the sarcasm here). Not to mention, never was there an apology for the inconvenience.

Clearly there is a management issue here, how hard is it to figure out how to have the correct number of drivers and to make sure if one of your employees doesn't show up, there is a back up plan in place? Considering the other reviews I failed to read, it really seems like a management scheduling issue! The convince of delivery just isn't worth it here!!!!  

I'm pretty sure in the franchise operations book there are scheduling help guidelines, so to the owner, you might want to read that. You could always contact your territory manager, the regional manager, or the operations team at Yum! Brands, I'm sure they'd be more than willing to help!"}
{"text":"Typically, I'm a bit of a snob and I shy away from chains.  I tend to think the local pizza restaurants are going to be so much better than any national chain.  However, I was home alone, it was cold, I was craving pizza, and I wanted it to be cheap.  So after looking for some deals I decided Pizza Hut.  Why not?  Ordering on-line was super-easy.  It has to be, otherwise who's going to order from here?  Click and it tells me 45 minutes till I get my pizza.  

Literally 20-25 minutes later, the doorbell rings and my pizza arrives.  The delivery guy was great.  Really friendly despite the cruddy weather.  So the delivery was smooth and super fast - I was impressed.

For pizza I got a thin crust with pepperoni and jalapenos.  I adore Pizza Hut's thin crust.  Crisp crunchy, super thin.  It is exactly how I like my crust.  The rest of the toppings were good as well.  Good toppings, good price, great crust, great delivery, seriously I was surprised and impressed.

So less than a week later I tried it again.  Same great crust AND same great delivery.  Again it was very fast and again the delivery guy (a different one this time) was super-friendly.

This is how all pizza delivery transactions should go.  I'm sure I'll be ordering again soon."}
{"text":"We used to order from this location pretty often, but the last time we ordered the driver forgot our side order of wings. Then when we reminded him, he said they were still in the car. He then pulled the wings from the car upside down. When we got them open they were the wrong thing! When I called the store I asked for the manager and was told that he was \"Too busy\" to take my call. So I left my name and number for them to call me back. They never called. They had an opportunity to correct my issue and instead they lost a customer! 
Order from the Domino's or Papa Johns! But avoid this store at all costs!"}
{"text":"Did an online order at 4:50 pm. Called around 6:00 to see what was going on with my delivery. The girl that answered had no idea. Put me on hold multiple times. First time I got hanged up on. Second call I was on hold over 10mins. To be told someone called and canceled my order. I never canceled or I wouldn't have called to check on my delivery. Spoke with a manager he was very rude and said someone called and gave my phone number to cancel my order. I used my pizza points for a free med and ordered numerous other items. And paid ahead with debit which was charged with no food in return. Very unprofessional and untruthful."}
{"text":"I have been ordering from this location for 11 years. Very rarely have I had any problems. Any time I have the management has always handled it quickly. 

The only reason I give 4 out of 5 is because this store is half a block from my house. I order delivery because of family with disabilities issue or I would just walk the half block and pick up the pizza myself. Not all the time but more often than normal the pizza shows up semi warm. The pizza should arrive hot as close as they are to me.This stores only problem is time management. 

The employees always shine through the managers mistakes and are always polite. I'll keep buying pizza from here."}
{"text":"Black hair in my wings and staff seemed either behind or they just hated their job. Pan pizza was good but the hand tossed was mostly crust with no cheese or toppings. Save your money and go somewhere else!!"}
{"text":"Just got charged $2.00 for \"soft drink\" for water.   According to waitress, the new policy is to charge for water.   I will never return."}
{"text":"We ordered a large thin crust pizza. When it was delivered, and we live 1 block away it was   cold and the crust was as hard as a cracker! Did not get what we paid for!!!!"}
{"text":"Terrible experience. I wish I could give negative stars or no stars. Placed an online order and paid with a credit card recently. The driver was 20 mins late! The pizza and wings were not hot. We called this location advised that our order is late and food was lukewarm. The person that answered advised that they were busy, didn't apologize and supposedly gave a $5 credit for our next order. 

Days later, looked at my credit card account statement and was CHARGED AN EXTRA $3!!!! This is CC fraud! Best believe I contacted this location very upset. Supposedly they are firing the delivery driver because we are the second caller to report this kind of incident. Makes me wonder how many other innocent people they are doing this to and other things. Businesses like this do not deserve to be open. If this is a franchised location, shame on the person running this. This is not a way to run a business. Maybe just simply hire deserving, trust worthy people that do their job.  

If anyone has to order from this Pizza Hut for whatever reason: Words of advise - check your order, keep track of the time from when your order was placed and pay in cash."}
{"text":"This is a non-dine-in, carryout or delivery only location. Some of the staff are pretty green, but they're friendly and polite. They get order correct and delivery is fairly prompt. Carryout times are a bit more than they say, but the wait isn't bad. All in all, it's Pizza Hut and you get what you expect."}
{"text":"The worst Pizza Hut ever. Stayed on hold for 10 mins trying to change an order. The manager Tiffany says it's not her problem their website had issues and because I called in and my order was wrong I had to wait 2.5hours to get my pizza when at first it was just an hour. Customer service is awful I won't be eating here ever again!"}
{"text":"Ordered delivery. Said 30 minutes. Almost 2 hours later a RAW stuffed crust (hardly) showed up....with wings that have been put into the microwave who knows how many times. Horrible. Avoid at all costs!"}
{"text":"I work at another Pizza Hut, but I visited this one as a customer. The manager was awesome and honored my discount. He was very friendly and had lots of patience with our indecisiveness. The food was awesome and super hot. My store doesn't have a wing street, so I was pleasantly surprised with the wings and fries. The place was remodeled very nicely and was very, very clean. I'm really impressed with this store!"}
{"text":"I wish I could give this place a 0. They've been a disappointment time after time.  My orders have been late (45 min to an hour) on several occasions, the delivery guy was horrible the last time I ordered. He was rude and mouth something on his way downstairs. I think I have a credit there which I will never use. Its been a while since I've ordered from this place. Pizza is sloppy, greasy, and gross. Truly a disappointing that they don't care to improve"}
{"text":"We have ordered from this Pizza Hut countless times, but this is the last straw. The pizza is never done when they say it will be and they always forget to give us the ranch or marinara that we pay to be added to our order. They also didn't know how to use a card with a chip in it!! Kept swiping two different cards and saying they weren't working. Made us go to an ATM so we could pay in cash. They were also handing put the wrong pizzas to people. This location has gone downhill fast. The food has always been decent, but the service is terrible and keeps getting worse!"}
{"text":"This location WAS one of the best and i drive out of my way to go there as I always pick up
BUT this is the third time my order has been messed up and yes, it was.
I always go back and check my order to see instead of my sausage and green pepper (how common) I got some sliced spicy something for my sausage.... It was ordered right. 
My son picked up last time no cin sticks
This order they decided we would not get our crust flavors on both, now i figured maybe not on a thin crust but we ALWAYS ask for cit in squared
Nope AGAIN... This is a common error, im trying to learn to live with it. Also my light sauce was covered
Today its almost like they were annoyed at us. Today was the first time I used my online account. Usually we use guest. Its getting that i can get the same crap at Dominos and its cheaper....
Get on your game, we order pizza once or twice a week so....

8/6/17 gave 5 today... i keep updating todays pizza was perfect!!!!! Thanks guys!!!"}
{"text":"I ordered the pizza from here tonight a large pizza and 2 liter soda which I ordered Diet Pepsi. The delivery came and the guy said that he grabbed the wrong stuff you brought regular Pepsi and not Diet Pepsi so he was going to have to go back and get Diet Pepsi for me so I took the piece and I went inside I opened up the pizza and it was horrible the whole center of the pizza had no cheese on it even it was literally just a cross with a little bit of brushed light sauce on it there was a little bit of cheese like a ring around the crust, no wonder when you order it asked you if you want extra cheese for $2 more little had I known they were going to give me no cheese I'll be posting a picture of the pizza here it was really bad and I'm very disappointed I'll probably never ever order from Pizza Hut again and I don't know why they make me do the deliveries from there when there's a Pizza Hut much closer to my house"}
{"text":"I have always enjoyed stuffed crust pizza and I haven't had it in years, so I thought, why not ?

The restaurant was pretty empty. Not really anyone eat just plenty of people working. 

Our server took our order and we received our pizza  . The pizza was greasy but not bad at all. We ordered marinara sauce as well which helped make the experience. 

I'm not a huge pizza fan but stuffed crust makes the decision easier. 

We didn't have a bad experience but we didn't really have a great one. We ate our food and left. I wouldn't come here unless I was getting stuffed crust again which I probably won't for a while but if you like pizza, I would suggest coming here. The food is decent and the service is decent as well ."}
{"text":"I wish that I could give this place half a star.  I just barely moved into my new condo in Scottsdale and wow I was excited! I ordered pizza and some special chicken alfredo. Sadly when the food arrived there were no napkins and no plastic ware. Generally comes with drive thru from Taco Bell or ... Which I probably should have done. After speaking to the manager LOGAN and telling him about my experience he immediately hung up on me. When I call back to try to rectify the situation I was on hold for 20 minutes. So I went to my neighbors house and use their phone.   Logan immediately answered and then once he knew it was me he hung up on me again. It could have been quite simple to apologize and rectify the situation. Evidently there's no management in management."}
{"text":"Gotta good deal on 2 mediums w unlimited tops. Tasty as always. Wish they baked an extra minute since so many toppings made it a bit soft in middle. Great crust. Ready in 10 mins or so. No issues!"}
{"text":"I am beyond displeased with this pizza hut. I had an order placed (a friend from Italy had placed the order) Not only did I not get my pizza, but I didn't even get a call. Now they won't replace the order. How fantastic is that? Not at all. DO NOT ORDER FROM THIS PIZZA HUT EVER"}
{"text":"Pizza Hut pizza is all the same to me no matter where you get it.  But what makes this place stand out is their friendly customer service and willingness to accept perfectly valid promotions and coupons that other Pizza Huts arbitrarily refuse.  On two occasions this location pulled through where another one failed.  Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"First time ordering from this location and unfortunately the last. My half cheese half pepperoni stuffed crust pizza came to the door as a half cheese half pepperoni with onions and olives pan pizza. I called the store where the girl seemed rushed or careless, possibly both. Anyway, I got another pizza sent out which was another 40min wait only to open the box to the same mistake. The only fixed problem was that it was stuffed this time. I felt bad for the delivery guy, he seemed embarrassed but we took it anyway not wanting to cause too much trouble. He even looked at my receipt and saw that it was right but the pizza was wrong. I hope I do get my credit but will use it at another location."}
{"text":"Good service at this location, Robert acknowledges you as soon as you walk in the door.. Orders are always correct too"}
{"text":"Picked up my order here which I placed over the Internet. It hasn't been open long so I decided to see if they can make pizza better than the one I go to which is a lot further from me. ( because the one closest to me is horrible) and I ask for extra sauce on both pizzas look like they actually gave me light sauce not even the regular regular lol oh well I tried."}
{"text":"Terrible service! Attempted to order a pizza with a side of mild sauce. She couldn't figure it out so she transferred us to her manager.  The manager never answered and the phone eventually hung up on us.  I attempted to call 2 more times directly after and the phones were never answered and eventually hung up again after 10 min each. Worst part is that the pizza Hut 10 minutes away from us is awesome but won't deliver to my house because it's \"not their zone\". So I have decided to never contact pizza Hut again!"}
{"text":"Someone let worthless employees Scott and Ashley know that a delivery driver driving around for 25 minutes in 100 degree heat with your thin crust extra sauce pizza is unacceptable. They wouldn't eat that GARBAGE yet they expect their customers to. 

You don't have to have a brain to work at this Pizza Hut, which is how Scott and Ashley got their jobs"}
{"text":"This is the second time I've ordered from them. No issues whatsoever. The pizza was a little cool by the time it got to my house but that may have been my husband not driving fast enough  The cheesy bread is my favorite!"}
{"text":"we ordered on line and picked up two pizza's, After picking up our pizza and getting it home we bit into one of our pizza's, it was so raw and nasty! I called and the manager said it was fine for us to come pick up a new one, so I said crispier please. I go and pick up new pizza and to my horror it was burnt! Black and hard as a rock! I had no choice but to bring it home. The crust was thin, which we did not order and the toppings were scarce. We had 1 medium pizza to share with 5 people. Threw them both in the trash! What a waste amd I personally ate a apple for dinner. Manager tried Ill give him that, but he should look at the pizza;s, after a complaint. Wonder if he would serve that doughy or very burnt pizza to his friends or family?? I would hope not! Never getting pizza from here again. I prefer to have gotten our money back ."}
{"text":"if i could give it 0 stars I would. Always get my order wrong, rude, pizza taste like shit. There is always some shady looking employees in there. They are always on their cell phones. The food is questionable. Dough is not fully cooked, half the pizza was almost dry and other half was dripping with sauce., my topping is almost nonexistent. I am soo over this place. Gave this place many chances got disappointed every time. I will be calling Veltre's next time."}
{"text":"OMG! Hair baked in the pizza! We ate a little over half of our veggie pizza. I was deciding if I wanted another slice and was staring at the pizza only to find a hair sticking out of it! I tried to pull it off but it was baked in! I'm mortified. I hope there wasn't any hair in the first two slices I ate. Please make sure you guys/girls wear hair nets when preparing people's food!"}
{"text":"I wanted something quick due to being too lazy to cook anything. I was craving metro pizza but I didn't feel like driving that far. So I stop here due to the fact it was close to my house. I ordered a large pan veggie pizza and I washed it down with a wine cooler. I was ok- I love pizza so it's one of my favorite foods."}
{"text":"GREEEEASY.

Some associates of mine ordered a pie from this place and within 2 hours of eating a slice of pizza, I had horrible indigestion and was nearly doubled over with cramps.

There are a lot of better options for pizza in this part of town; both dine-in restaurants & delivery service."}
{"text":"Terrible experience today. We were charged $ 14.49 each for a medium size pizza 2 toppings that was advertised for $ 5.99. Talked to Pizza Hut but they did not agree to refund the extra amount. No more Pizza Hut for us"}
{"text":"I have given this place 2 tries and they are just terrible. The sauce here taste funny and the overall pizza was not good. The worst thing about this place is the wait times. The last time I order over the phone app and it said my pizza was ready for pickup at 6:10pm. I got there right on time and watched them hand my order to the person in front of me. They then had to remake my order which made me wait there for 20 minutes."}
{"text":"Expensive compared to the  quality 
Chicken wings came hot but small and are not good quality 
I called the guy who answered me said they don't deliver to my address but my roommate she called later and they delivered the pizza 
I give them 5 stars cause i am nice"}
{"text":"Horrible.. Manager Steve is full of excuses and doesn't care about my concerns or care about customer service.. Corporate will hear what I want to wright on here.. Never ever will I spend my money here again.."}
{"text":"This place accepted and charged me for an internet order. When the pizza hadn't arrived in one hour, I phoned them. That's when they told me they were running three HOURS behind."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying that I used to work at this exact Pizza Hut as a delivery driver, so I'm fairly familiar with how the system works. Unless they changed something dramatically in the last couple years, there's no excuse for it to take almost 2 hours to deliver a pizza after being told it'd take 20-30 minutes.

All I ordered was one large pizza, and I live about 5 minutes away. Now I do understand that there's other deliveries to be made, and if there's only one driver (which it sounded like there was) it'll only take longer. However, it was a Tuesday. In the middle of the summer. At 8 o'clock at night. And I know for a fact that they would've only had at most 2-3 orders around that time. I also know that it takes 10 minutes to make a pizza and that the absolute longest delivery time is 30 mins - 15 minutes there, 15 minutes back - so most deliveries (from time of ordering to delivery at the door) is 25 minutes or less. 

So after about 1 1/2 hours of waiting, I finally called asking wtf is going on. I was told that our driver had just left a couple minutes before with our pizza and should arrive within the next 5 minutes. Half an hour later (again, we only live 5 minutes away), he finally shows up. Doesn't apologize for the extreme lateness, just smugly says \"sign here\" and left. At 9:45 pm. 

So in my opinion, the douchebag was just dicking around and as a former driver, he deserved the $0 tip he received."}
{"text":"Horrible pizza! I ordered pizza for my staff and when the food finally came, we had to go out and get it because the driver didn't \"know where we were\", nor did she even attempt to ask us where the closest entrance was. The pizza looked as bad as it tasted. It appeared to have been sitting out for a long time before it was delivered. I will not be ordering from here ever again!"}
{"text":"This place is gross! My kids were covered in ants and we had to move to another table! 15 minutes later he came to take our order. 25 minutes later her brought our drinks, we asked how long till our order would be ready and he said shortly.  20 minutes later I went up to the counter to ask if it was going to be done in the next 5 minutes because we were going to leave. The manager said we just put the orders in the over and it would be another 20 minutes.  Then he asked what flavor were the wings that we ordered.  I told he we are leaving and he said sorry!   One hour and 30 minutes of my family's time was waisted! I will never go there again!!!"}
{"text":"Always wonderful service at this location. Thanks a lot for the awesome drawing on my pizza box! Made my night just a little bit better at work!"}
{"text":"I wish I could get a negative star to this Pizza Hut. OK, we obviously know that we aren't ordering gourmet pizza when we placed our order tonight. But, my kiddos love their stuffed crust so as good, responsible parents, we make sacrifices for our kiddos! 

Tonight was an absolutely HORRIBLE experience. Not only is there no excuse for our pizza arriving cold to the touch (we live 1.4 miles from this store) but you would think that if you wait over an hour, it could at least arrive warm. Then, insult to injury, our wings were short! Maybe the delivery driver got hungry on the way over. He must have snagged our Blue Cheese and Ranch sauces (that we had to pay for!) too because they were missing. 

So, I called this store and talked to their \"manager\" Crystal. Not only did she immediately begin making excuses for her staff and their horrific service, but she then had the nerve to act put out by issuing a credit to our account for HALF of what we actually paid. Out of principal, I should have had her remake the entire order. 

Since when it is OK to accept mediocrity as the norm? Do yourself a favor, order from Dominoes (as my husband so lovingly reminded me tonight)"}
{"text":"We had a pan pizza with breadsticks for lunch and omgoodness was it delicious!!! When she opened the box the pizza looked perfect, the cheese didn't have a single burn spot!!     The store is now under new management so please give them another chance if you've had a bad experience there in the past. The owner waited on me today and she's such a nice person and she told me how horribly the place was run in the past. So if you're in the mood for the Hut call the one in Etna!!! =)"}
{"text":"Would not take my credit card even though I tried to explain that the billing address was different from the delivery address (DUH- I've been thru it many times before). Had to cancel my order, after waiting 30 MINUTES, because they refused to deliver my pizza. Will never order here again."}
{"text":"I am surprised other reviews here are less than satisfactory.  I like the pizza hut at this location.  I usually do take out or sometimes dine there.  When I do take out it is usually pretty busy..

When I went to dine it one time they made a pizza wrong and then gave it to my family and I for free so that was cool.  My only complaint is that the food is unhealthy so that is why I haven't been back."}
{"text":"Terrible service twice now, 2 Saturdays in a row we walked out of this restaurant having not been seated for over 10 minutes, then when getting seated not being approached for over 15 minutes no water or any attention from the wait staff"}
{"text":"The box says, \"make it great\", but the contents were far from it. First of all, I had pretty low expectations coming from a Yum Brands chain (Long John Silver's, A&W, etc.), but man, there were a couple of things that stood out:

1.) The buffalo nugget things were dry and no amount of ranch dressing could hide it.

2.) The pizza slices were incredibly light, indicating to me that the mass of the pizza was mostly air in the dough and that the dense toppings (sauce, cheese) were lacking.

It was funny because my roommates ordered 2 medium pizzas to deal with the stress or whatever that comes at the end of the semester. They both walked away from it feeling unsatisfied at best, grease-poisoned at worst. The upside, it was pretty cheap. If you are looking for quantity, come here."}
{"text":"It was so good. We have been lookibg for a great pizza and you hit the mark. We will order again. And your online ordering made it tease and loved the text letting me know it was on it's way was great. 
Loved the crust, cheese sauce and topping.
Delivery person was nice and friendly and professional"}
{"text":"I had a bad experience here in the past. My food was delivered burnt. I work in the food industry. Never serve food you would not eat yourself. I decided to give them a second chance. I was pleased with my food this time around. Therefore I will put my rating to 3 stars from 1."}
{"text":"HORRIBLE! 2nd time now ordering pizza from here and it was not fully cooked! The first time we ordered delivery and it was close to closing so we sort of let it slide. Today I ordered carry out and picked it up. All seemed fine until I got home. The center was raw dough. I am currently baking it in the oven in hopes of salvaging dinner on a crazy busy Thursday. This place SUCKS!"}
{"text":"I only gave this sh$@hole one star because I could not give them zero.  We ordered a large pizza, 8 wings, breadsticks and the cookie online and after waiting almost two hours had a cold pizza delivered AND they forgot over half of our order .  The idiot driver refused to give the tip back and kept tryjng to get us  to say he didn't need to come back.  Well after he left we looked  at the pizza.  It was burnt and cold.  So  after waiting two hours we drove to the store.  I must have tried to call 17 times with no answer.  The \"manager\" on duty was lucky she refunded our money.  I have never in my life experienced such bad service.  DO NOT  order from this place."}
{"text":"I ordered 2 pizzas and garlic knots take out and my pizza was over cooked, I was so disappointed. Only half of it was actually cheesy and the rest had to go in the trash because it was so dried up."}
{"text":"This review is to continue my previous review posted from service a month ago. I wasn't impressed then however even though I never heard from the company after my complaint we tried it again. The convenience and price cannot be beat! Ordering online was easy. Pizza was ready in 15 minutes or carry out. It already looked better when being picked up. Fresh and delicious. Upon tasting the pizza it was just that. The crust was its nice buttery flavor and fluffy again. The toppings were generous and fresh. Only complaint would be there was too much sauce this time and the cheese wasn't quite cooked enough. Seemed a little underdone. However compared to last time this was boat loads better. 

While I am still unimpressed there was no response after contacting the company at least I didn't get the same experience again. We will continue to order here when we don't feel like going far from home."}
{"text":"We used to frequent this location while living in the Seneca residence a couple hundred meters away.

What a terrible Pizza Hut location. It's kind of a disgrace to their name from what I've experienced at other franchise locations.

The pizza is still good though and I suppose that's all that matters if your ordering out."}
{"text":"Went there about an hour ago, my husband and I got there no one was at the counter we had to call the person out of the kitchen.  Taking our order was slow.  The menus are dirty.  I had to wash my hands.  We order salads and pizza.  We got our pizza first and the waitress forgot our salads.  Never again we are coming to this restaurant.  I was disappointed."}
{"text":"Would give a big fat 0 stars if you could. Ruined OLD food, rude manager with NO people skills or phone etiquette!! Lost future orders for sure!!!!"}
{"text":"Had a great example of good customer service tonight with Brian! Also the pizza was delicious but customer service makes all the difference."}
{"text":"I wish No star was an option.  This place was clueless.  No customer service and my order was wrong on two counts and neither could be fixed by associate at the register or the so- called manager.  Papa Johns is by far a better option if you want this type of fast food pizza and feeding around 10 teenage boys for a reasonable price."}
{"text":"The food and service here consistently gets slower and worse. On top of that it's so dirty!"}
{"text":"I guess everyone in my neighborhood goes elsewhere for their pizza, gets it delivered, or the fact that it's a carry out joint is off putting; in any case the Super Supreme Pan style is a great stand-by pizza. Just as I remembered it to be. I'm simple. The pizza was hot, well balanced topping wise and not salty (a big plus)."}
{"text":"I've order 2 pizzas from this store a week ago, 1 pizza was completely COLD, then the other pizza (for my kids) had a cockroach in it!!!!! I called and complained and they literally told me that they can't do anything about it since it was already taken out of the store. It's a disgusting place. The general manager is RUDE and doesn't know how to be a manager. I will NEVER be going here again. This place is disgusting!!!!! They really need to get there health codes up!"}
{"text":"Had an awesome takeout experience, amazing food, very fast service. Was unsure about going because of bad ratings but went anyways and it turned out way way better than I expected!"}
{"text":"Decided to order a pizza and saw a pizza hut commercial so thought yea I'll give it a try since I had not had pizza hut in ages!!!!! Called in to place my order and the women who answered the phone \"Gullian\" or something like that, was the rudest and probably had the worst customer service that I have ever experienced! When I asked what my crust options were again she paused took a deep breath as if she was irritated with me asking for the options of the pizza I am going to pay for. She got loud and rude so I  let it slip but by the second time when I asked how many topings she raised her voice and began to yell out the answer.  That is just uncalled for and disrespectful to customers. When I called back to ask for the manager she claimed to be the manager. If this place is ran by people like this, I want no part of it! Took my money to papa johns and enjoyed their friendly upbeat service.  Thanks pizza hut for that awful experience I will probably never be trying pizza hut ever again."}
{"text":"If I could give negative stars I would. PizzaHut is failing with this location, epically. We have lived with this as our closest location for 2 years and all three times throughout that period we've ordered from them our food has been AT LEAST 30 minutes late, completely cold AND incorrect. I've called every time and been told I'd have a credit on my account, yet I've never been able to use said credit when returning to try them again. Needless to say, we will NOT be giving them anymore chances. I feel like when a customer calls in this situation, something more than \"a credit\" for next time I want to order from your crappy location with cold, incorrect food should be offered. Like refunding my $25 this time and we can all part peacefully. It really can't be that hard to work here so I'm not sure what the issue is. Maybe corporate should get more involved in training and coaching these employees."}
{"text":"My favorite Pizza Hut! I nanny and I'm also very forgetful, so I'm always forgetting my lunch. My go to--this Pizza Hut. I have never been disappointed with any of my food. And the delivery driver, Matt, is awesome! He's always very friendly. And the girls I nanny for are normally very timid around strangers, but they get exited when \"the pizza guy\" gets here. His positive attitude is infectious! Great service all around here! Thanks guys!"}
{"text":"I don't normally put bad reviews on here, like seriously you can look through all my old ones but for real though this is needed. I ordered a medium pizza with three toppings, 8 chicken wings and bread sticks online at 7:30 pm and the conformation email said 8:39. My food did not arrive until 9:00 pm I called at 8:55 and they said it had just left and would be here shortly. Which it did come shortly after but the food was ice cold! I was like wow really. Like I'm mad I tipped for cold food."}
{"text":"We decided to have pizza so I got my very first personal pan pizza in my years of life.  It was delicious and then even made my special order with no cheese.  Service was ok and wait time was about 20 minutes.  I would go back to this location."}
{"text":"The food was good, but the forgot my wings and soda that I had ordered. This wasn't a pleasant experience for my family."}
{"text":"I brought my family and a couple friends. Wasn't expecting to have the extra people but oh well can't say no. So I told the manager (Anthony) that I was a little broke and he showed me a couple specials they were running. He made sure I got the right amount of bang for my buck so to speak.  I read the reviews and decided to be lenient on the whole drink situation. If you've read my reviews you will know I'm hard on a full cup. When the manager seen I was draining my cup dry long before the server came back, he comped my another cup so I wouldn't run dry. Cut them some slack. They do delivery, to go, AND a dining area. It's Pizza Hut. Pizza Hut is known for delivering pizzas. Never in my mind have I thought of going to Pizza Hut for the phenomenal waitressing. They aren't curing cancer here guys. The pizza was bomb. Drinks were good and the price was more than right for my crew to get full. Will come back for sure!!"}
{"text":"If I could I would give this place 0 out of 5 for never having enough servers. They told us to wait for 30 min for a table even though they had empty tables. The reason was because they did not have enough servers and this is the second time this has happened. Never going there again until they hire more staff."}
{"text":"Pizza was almost raw and undercooked save yor money. This place sucks."}
{"text":"Horrible. Waited 15 minutes cuz the staff was too lazy to clean tables. There were plenty if empty tables but they were all dirty and had dishes stacked on them.
Waitress messed up BOTH of r simple pizza orders. When the correct ones finally arrived they were awful. All crust and very little toppings. 
We watched a server drop a take out container on the floor then proceed to fill it with someone's leftovers. Same server then filled another container on top of a pile of dirty plates. 
Will never return to another Pizza Hut again."}
{"text":"I admit that I have gone here a couple more times than I should have, but I always come back . . not for the service, but for the convenience. I've yet to go into this location and not have to wait for someone from the back to come in ever so slowly. The people here seem to have no care at all, and are very carefull as to not show you one smile. the service is terrible, the pizza/wings are usual."}
{"text":"The thing this location really lacks is friendly employees. Lots of young people are hired for the front and you can tell they're not thrilled to be there. The pizza is your typical Pizza Hut and I'm a fan of the weekday buffet. Overall not thrilled by this location but I like PH and it's close."}
{"text":"Absolutely worst place ever how does spicy BBQ rhyme with garlic parmesean, it doesn't! ! Ordered spicy BBQ got garlic parmesean wtf called them n I  said wanted new pizza n new wings to which I was told why do u need a new pizza, to which I replied we wanted to eat wings with pizza duh!!! Dumb ass MOD ( Mgr on duty) proceeded to tell me she couldn't give me RGM OR DM name or number, total bullshit! !!! What company doest provide a second line of communication to handle dissatisfied customers, answers NONE! This dumb HALFWITT just took it upon herself to try n not get reported. This is exactly why you will never compete with papa John's or domino's definitely last time I order from these dumb ass hacks passing themselves off as a reputable business FU domino's u suck!!!!!!! Should have ordered from them instead but my son wanted pizza Hut guess he just got a lesson on how not to run a business!!!!!"}
{"text":"Son ordered personal pan pizza, cheese which was the usual fare for PH. Kids love it.

I ordered the wings (the Mild Buffalo) but was talked into the Honey BBQ by the waitress that said it was milder than the other. Ok.

So I eat 3 of the 6 wings and feel a little full/nauseous.  But feel hungry enough to eat a few bites of my son's pizza.  So we pay and head over to Tuesday Morning.  I'm there not 10 minutes before I'm asking for the key to the restroom.   OMG    Maybe the left the honey BBQ wings out too long? Maybe something else, but I was in the bathroom twice before I left 25 minutes in the bathroom and 10 minutes shopping.   I was thankful I made it home before the next wave hit.    
After that I was fine.  

I just feel there was something wrong with the honey BBQ wings because she went out of her way to get me to order them and then look what happened.  Wont be going there anymore."}
{"text":"Orders always ready on time and exactly as requested. Would be great if the staff didn't speak in another language in front of customers while they are waiting to order (seen it several times) it's just a tad awkward. However that's only a minor detail as this is literally a pick up location so you aren't really here for amazing service, you're here to satisfy a pizza craving haha"}
{"text":"The only Pizza Hut buffet in Nevada! Our server was Dawn and she was awesome! Pizza's were delicious and Dawn kept the refills coming.  Keep up the great work!"}
{"text":"This is probably the closest Pizza Hut to my work place!  Can't lose to order 2 large take-out to munch on at work.

I made my order online to be fast since I'm on a crunch for lunch.  Made my way there and my pizzas were ready.  I noticed that this location was an actual sit down Pizza Hut.  Soft drink machines and plenty of space.  I would assume that it would be great for after little league games and events like that.  

Service was friendly, she gave me a bag for the plates and condiments I asked for.  Also popped each box open so I could be sure that the order was correct.  I ordered one pep, sausage, olive; one bacon, ham, pep.  Both were wonderful, toppings were evenly spread apart and adequate.  

I'll def come back once my coworker and I get the craving for pizza again.  Always nice to save a few bucks to fill up 3 guys."}
{"text":"I wish I could give this place zero stars!!! My husband and I just ordered and when I pulled out my pizza I noticed a long strand of hair in the cheese... We called back and spoke to jade who is reportedly the general manager(horrible!!) she refused to give us her last name so we could make a formal complaint! Will never go here"}
{"text":"One of the worst Pizza Hut experiences ever. Long story short, not only did they mess my order up, but also the other 3 orders prior to me as well. And all three of them got complimentary meals without asking. But not me, maybe they felt as if I wouldn't notice. Very unorganized store. Do not go there."}
{"text":"Everything is always so good and hot when delivered plus they deliver really fast every time 
this is the best Pizza Hut ever"}
{"text":"While the food is always good at any Pizza Hut, my main beef with this location is their delivery drivers. The past two times I put in an order online, I mentioned what code they needed to enter to get past the gate. But they called me anyway to have me head down to get the pizza from them. I'm most likely gonna have my pizza delivered from elsewhere."}
{"text":"We ordered a hawaiin pizza with extra bacon and extra cheese.  The pizza they brought us looked like someone elses rejected pizza.  You could tell it was not \"freshly\" baked. The pineapple was placed on top of the pizza after it was baked, so either they had forgotten it or it was a pizza they had, that was already made and they put the pineapple on it.  There wasn't any extra cheese on it, the cheese was so thin, there were actually spots on the pizza that didn't have any on it... almost every time we have ordered from them, they have screwed up something in our order...."}
{"text":"We ordered a pizza online from here for supper, we ordered the bbq pizza to have bbq sauce, chicken, bacon, pineapple, extra cheese, and onions on half of it, with cheddar crust and bbq drizzle. It said it would be delivered in 33 minutes, 55 minutes later the delivery guy came to our house, he had a sour attitude.... our pizza was warm, not hot... and it had no sauce on the pizza.... it had the drizzle, but no sauce.. when I called to tell them they forgot the bbq sauce, the manager was not friendly at all, he sounded like my call was interupting his life.... he offered a five dollar credit for our next order.... this is very disappointing."}
{"text":"I've placed an order @7:37 pm tonight says will be here by 8:37pm, I called around the hour mark and they're now saying it will be 1 hr 30mins from now, so I've basically waited 2.5hrs for a fukn pizza, last time I order frlm"}
{"text":"Order was almost 30 minutes late.

Driver was standing outside of my building and couldn't get in, even though I have specific directions over the phone.

Rude employees and told me I wasn't allowed to order from them again. Like I would, everyone working there is a half wit."}
{"text":"This is the slowest place I've ever seen. Not even a welcome or I'll be right with you. Don't bother coming here...not like pizza hut is anything special so I would go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Pizza is okay but compared to other pizza huts in the area it was pretty terrible. We got the firery red pepper sticks and they just tasted like dry bread. We kept putting crushed pepper on them ourselves. They're great everywhere else we go. And they're supposed to be an appetizer but they were brought out after our pizza. The crust on our pizza was very under cooked. We were never offered a refill and we didn't see our waitress again until she brought us the check. She walked over and just grabbed the money and walked away not saying a word. We had to ask three times for a box for our pizza. Then we were just sitting there and every employee kept asking if we needed something else and they weren't trying to be helpful. We could tell by the sighs we got after we said no thanks. They were hinting at us to leave even though they were open for another hour. The manager then just started washing the floor as we were walking out splashing water all over our feet. We felt very unwelcomed. I personally never liked this Pizza Hut. I think all the employees are rude, but my friend likes it because it's a sit down restaurant. I will never be back."}
{"text":"TL;DR- MAIN reason for two stars- employees. Long wait. Pizza was good though, and came out correctly. 

Oh lord....
Ordered online for pickup on 3/31/17. 
Placed ordered at 6:34pm- just two normal pizzas- I got a notification saying it should be ready in 10-20 minutes. Got there at 6:55pm. There was a screen in the corner that had our name and said order would be ready at 6:49pm... and it was 6:55.... not a big deal, computers get it messed up. 
Sat down after paying. First red flag. Jared, the kid at the counter, took our money without saying more than \"what's the name on your order?\" Not very friendly or inviting. For the duration of my wait, I never saw him smile at a single customer. For a Friday night at about 7, there wasn't much going on. Me, two ladies, and one guy who seemed to be waiting for an order. Now this is the thing that REALLY bothered me-- the phone started ringing almost as soon as I sat down after paying. There was no one else there yet... Jared just would NOT pick it up... some girl came up to pay, and he took that, but still wouldn't pick up the phone! This phone was ringing for at least ten minutes before he picked it up! I feel so bad for whoever was calling. Just for no reason-he was RIGHT there- he did not pick it up. Why? He didn't feel like it or something? He was doing absolutely nothing. Also, I saw people walking around in the back who seemed to not be doing anything. And some lady (older, short, red (ish?) hair) came up to address someones concern... uh, for what I presume to be a manager, she was very unkempt. Her hair was everywhere, she kept sighing and rubbing her eyes talking to this customer as though she were tired, sick, or just sick AND tired of talking to customers. She was one of the people I saw just walking around and seemingly not doing anything.
A little less bothersome, because I have no idea- maybe y'all had a bunch of deliveries- but the wait was very long for two medium pizzas... like I said, I ordered at 6:34pm. I believe we walked out of there a little after 7:10pm. 
Look, I know you guys just opened. I think a lot of these kinks could be worked out with a change in staff, or a change in HEART of the current staff. Yeah, kids may be desperate for a job, but don't hire them just because they're not as demanding, when they can't treat customers right. Maybe there are some other kids working really hard in the back. But if so, don't keep the one kid with no people skills, who doesn't care, in the front. On a Friday night?! When there will inevitably be more business than usual?! Staffing wasn't thought through.... 
I hope that I'm convinced to update my review through more visits and better experiences.
**EDIT- Just to add! Think about putting a tip jar up front for cash tips! Might motivate front employees a little more...."}
{"text":"This is a HORRIBLE Pizza Hut location. I don't know what their problem is. I've had orders messed up five different times now. One of the times the manager gave me a credit for a free pizza, yet next time I called in the other manager said that I couldn't have it for free, but only a discounted price. THEY HAVE AN ACCOUNT FOR ME ON FILE, it's not like I just pulled that out of my A** when I called back!!

Our food has been incorrect, things have been missing, and it has shown up bone dry before. No fun, and they don't even act like they care when you call.

The latest debacle this evening was the wings. I like my wings saucy. Shouldn't be a problem, right? A long time ago, I ordered their wings and they were mostly dry. So from that point forward, I ordered extra sauce, which you have to pay 50 cents more. Yet every time I did that, the wings were drowning in sauce, so I didn't even need the extra sauce on the side. I kept paying for extra sauce for no reason. Tonight, I orders wings (no extra sauce) and just put a note to make sure the wings were sauced well. 

My order is delivered...NO blue cheese that I paid money for, and the wings have spots where there isn't any wing sauce on them at all. Seriously??!!!!!

I called and spoke with an extremely unhelpful guy, he sounded young. He wasn't listening to what I was trying to say and at one point said that I could order my wings without sauce on them. WTF my problem is that you guys don't put enough sauce on them!!! He then went on to say that my note said extra sauce and since I didn't pay they didn't put it on. Yet A) my note never said \"extra\" and B) I always got the phone call from them in the past saying if you want extra sauce you have to pay the driver 50 cents. No phone call this time. I assumed that my directions in basic English would be clear to the average Pizza Hut worker. He said it's how they \"interpret\" the note.

There is another Pizza Hut location closer to me, but for some reason this is the one that is assigned my address for delivery. Apparently the credit that they wanted to give me for the blue cheese is only good if I order from their location again. What a joke. I told them to not bother with the credit and hung up.
I guess from now on we will only be eating Pizza Hut if we want to pick up our order, since we're done with this location for good."}
{"text":"I was visiting from out of town and decided to stop in for a bite to eat. Let me tell you, this was some of the worst customer service I have ever received. 30 minute wait for a dinner box. Disgusting attitude from all of the employees. There is absolutely ZERO concept of customer service in this establishment. I expected much more from Pizza Hut."}
{"text":"An hour for delivery after being told 20 to 30 minutes when ordering. Delivery driver was friendly but person taking orders was less than happy about her job."}
{"text":"Worst series of events ordering pizza ever. First off we paid $80 with a good tip for 2 large pizzas 6 pop 5 dipping sauces. The pizza came under cooked to the point it tasted like the dough was raw. Called in and they said they will send the driver to pick up the pizzas then send new ones. 40 mins later he arrives with pizza that is burnt to the point the sauce is dried up. The meat is black I called in and the girl said \"the dough was probably frozen or something\" at which point I said no problem
I won't order from you ever again and we ordered from a place that knows how to cook"}
{"text":"Can't believe they are still in business.  Pay double and go to Cerino's across the street or Angie's a couple miles away.  Worth every penny.  Pizza Hut is dead."}
{"text":"Worst Pizza Hut Anywhere.  Pie was damn near inedible.  Crust is never cooked."}
{"text":"Great food and service every time we come here. You can't beat the price for all you can eat pizza.

The restaurant is always clean, and during lunch it's never super crowded. They manage to keep the pizza coming, we've never had to wait for pizza in the buffet."}
{"text":"I called for delivery at almost 10pm. Staff was amazing, seemed happy and jolly, and provided excellent service. Thank you!"}
{"text":"This location always offers great, prompt customer service. I always opt to order online as they make it so simple and easy to do so. Delivery is always fast with the pizza always being fresh and hot. 
Also, best delivery guy has to be Mike! He is very funny and always has extra condiments and utensils on hand. He really does go above & beyond. I've had him deliver my order a few times and its always a pleasure to see him. 

Thanks again PH!"}
{"text":"What a dump!  We ordered a special for this location from the website and we went and PAID the cashier for this item twenty minutes after it was supposed to be done, only for them to tell us they COULDN'T make the item in question and say \"what do you expect US to do about it?\"  It was one of the box meals, which included a medium pizza, small order of breadsticks and cinnastix.  The manager actually REFUSED to make these things because, get this, she didn't have the big box and didn't want to provide the additional boxes just to give us what we ordered!  Now, don't get me wrong; I wouldn't complain if when we walked in the door they told us, \"Sorry, we couldn't give you this deal.\" and NOT taken our money, but they took payment for something they didn't do!  We got our money back, but only AFTER some convincing the \"nice\" manager that keeping our money would in fact be STEALING.  Truth be told, I think they just goofed off and never made the deal and rather than deal with us (three HOURS before closing) they just chose to tell us they didn't have the right box, because who in their right mind would use such a stupid excuse?  So we went down to the Portofino's and had the most amazing cheese pizza.  So guess who's getting our business from now on?  Certainly NOT Pizza Hut!"}
{"text":"I loved Pizza Hut as a child... That ice cream bar... Wow... Is it the location? Probably. This place is just poop. The service,what the hut guys?"}
{"text":"I have become more of a fan of Pizza Hut since they expanded their offering (like the different crust flavors) and online ordering. This has been a big game changer for me. The food is still pretty good and they have good online deals. Inside is decently clean. Most places only have the small lobby and is well decorated with a TV that shows order numbers that are being served. They really try to keep up with the times.

Good service can be hit or miss. Since I primarily do online ordering my interaction with employees are limited. But, I can tell you my online order has never been made wrong yet, which makes me really happy!

It has been a long time since I have gotten chicken wings or breadsticks at Pizza Hut so I cannot comment on that but I still like the pizza, especially with the online deals that make it a good value."}
{"text":"I've only ordered online and picked up at this location so I cannot comment about the service when sitting down at the restaurant. Sending in orders online has been super convenient. It has saved me time, money and my owner has never been wrong. The online deals are really good. We get $7.99 for a 2 topping large and then an online discount on top of that. You cannot beat that price compared to other pizza places for a freshly cooked pizza. Pizza hut's wide range of combinations makes it even better. I've tried out so many. I even tried out the skinny pizza which wasn't too bad. Being able to do half and half is a great way for my girlfriend and I to share a pizza.

This location has a ton of parking because its in the big shopping center and there isn't many shops on this side. Every time I've come to pick up my pizza there has only ever been one car in the parking lot.

When coming to pick up the pizza was are always helped promptly and are in and out really quickly. Our transaction is completed and that's it, no other conversation.

Doing orders online has really changed my outlook on this place. You get good pizza without the wait or hassle of going in to order and waiting for the food. I don't see myself coming to sit in the dinning area anytime soon."}
{"text":"I wish it were a sit down place! I thought it was and I ended up taking the two kids I babysit to Nellos.  I wanted Pizza Hut! It's okay though, I'll order delivery or pick up from them later on."}
{"text":"Great delivery drivers. Even at the end of his shift one returned a forgotten side of sauce to us from the order. Ultra nice guy"}
{"text":"I looove pizza and if I need a quick pizza fix or I'm super desperate I'll order from Pizza Hut. Yesterday was the first time I ordered online from this particular pizza hut. I went to pick up inside and that was a big mistake. Seriously the worst smell hit me as soon as I walked in the door. It's was like they cleaned the floors with dirty mops or something. I looked in the back where the \"kitchen\" is and there was food scattered around the floor and I witnessed a pizza pan fall to the floor while two workers walked passed it and didn't bother to pick up, is that normal? Like I honestly would not sit and eat in this restaurant it felt very dirty.

    I still took my pizza home, like I said I really love pizza..the only reason for two stars is because the food still tasted good, and I didn't die from food poisoning. But yeah, very dirty, gross smelling restaurant."}
{"text":"Yes to the pan pizza and especially to the BREADSTICKS!  

One of the nicer Pizza Hut locations.  Right on the main Perry Highway stretch in Wexford.  It's always very clean and the interior is better than I'd expect.  I've never had a problem with the service either; the waiters have always been polite."}
{"text":"GOOD:  
Like any other Pizza Hut, the pan pizza and breadsticks are yummy.  I can't say anything about dining at this location, but I've ordered delivery from them many times because they are located only about 5 minutes from my place. 

BAD:
I don't recommend ordering delivery from them unless you're not feeling super concerned with the waiting time. Their estimated delivery time online is always way off every time I order.  Last time my food came over an hour later than the time they said it would.   This Pizza Hut location seems to have an issue with having enough drivers available because they consistently run behind schedule.  Customer service isn't great in general either... they rarely give you a phone call to let you know if your order has been delayed and when you do call them concerned, they don't seem to know where their driver is and just say it should be there soon."}
{"text":"I enjoy Pizza Hut! But the workers here are beyond unorganized. My wife and I often order Pizza Hut because I prefer the pan style pizza. This location has horrible customer service and provides incorrect orders. Messed up our order 3 times and had to beg them to fix their mistake twice. 

If you order from here you may get weird snot looking stuff on the inside of your box which is not a pizza ingredient or order breadsticks and get a nasty pasta dish instead. 
Now I have to find another Pizza Hut to go to because it's not the foods fault the employees suck! 
Bon appetite!"}
{"text":"Had an AWESOME experience with one gentleman on the phone when ordering takeout. This dude was a straight G. 10/10. Would order again"}
{"text":"Its a real hit our miss if you get the you order right and the dough could be cooked more"}
{"text":"I think it's the best pizza in town. Service is very friendly and the pizza is always fresh and delicious. We keep returning a few times per month. I have tried other pizza but this is the best"}
{"text":"ordered a pepperoni and green pepper pizza, could'nt even see the peppers, asked the girl behind the counter what happened, she said\" I don't know what they do back there\" then asked for some grated parm oh we're outta that... Very disappointed with my order... will never go back, lost a commited customer with this one, no stars would have been a better review. I hope they go out of business."}
{"text":"The Pizza Hut moved from its original location (now the site of Rice Inn) to the strip mall in between its former location and the intersection of 88 and Broughton/Bethel Church Rd. I forget the name of the strip mall, but this Pizza Hut is located near that Western laundromat and the Brusters. It is also near Golden Wok Inn (which despite the reviews that weren't filtered, has amazing homestyle Hong Kong food).

This Pizza Hut has no dining room. It's carryout/delivery only.

At first, their menu didn't specify that they had the $10 any size any topping pizza that is advertised nationally. But if you ask them, they will have it.  It's hard to beat a $10 large supreme pizza."}
{"text":"Wow, I was surprised by the negative reviews. We've gotten pizza here a couple of times, and not had any issues. I was there last night, and the staff was super friendly, pizza was ready when I got there, and hot."}
{"text":"Horrible...placed an order at 7:42pm got an email confirmation stated my order will be delivered at 8:32pm it is now 9pm and my order still has not been delivered. I didn't know I ordered by pony express....."}
{"text":"Super slow, super lazy and super inefficient staff. To top it all, they shower you with enough toppings of racism. It was a very bad experience for us.

Pizza Hut, we love your products, but not these kind of franchises. Please do something about it. It's a bummer to have a Pizza Hut at half a mile from our house, but one that we would never ever visit again!"}
{"text":"My family has ordered from this location multiple times for delivery with no issues before. Tonight my husband and I try to order delivery, and the location messed up our address, went to the wrong address, then called us and proceeded to tell us that they would not be delivering our food since they went to the wrong address. Even though it was THEIR fault they entered the wrong address. We then called the store to fix the problem, and get placed on hold for 20 minutes, just to be told they couldn't fix it and wouldn't be delivering. Both workers we spoke to were very rude, and absolutely no help. I have no idea why this location is even open and why these workers are even still employed. Definitely will be getting my refund by tomorrow night, and definitely will never order from this location again. I'd recommend to Pizza Hut, shut down this location, and fire all of the employees there"}
{"text":"If I could give this place less than one star I would. 
The pizza, wings and breadsticks are so crappy I had to throw it all out after just one bite. I called to get my money back but nothing could be done. So screwy. Won't be coming to this location EVER again. Made my whole Pizza Hut experience unbearable."}
{"text":"I ordered tonight on the online app and I give me the store. I got the wrong pasta  after waiting a long time for my order already the delivery driver gave me a free 2 Liter for the inconvenience. I opened my pasta and it is one of each one I ordered one I did not order. So I called the store which I never complain and explain the situation and was told that's what we got ordered on our menu so that's why they sent. After explaining to whoever was on the phone what happen with the order even though I order the same thing off the app went back-and-forth with me and then offer me a credit for food I have that I don't want to eat that I did not order. So this is the last time all get from the store and just drive to State Road and pick up where I never had an issue."}
{"text":"As a loyal customer I am completely over this location. Today I called to get my regular order and the rudest person answered the phone; I later found out that it was a manager, Lynda. When I call the order taker usually repeats my last order and asks if I am ordering the same; which I always do but she claimed she was unable to see past order information. I explained this to her and my last order magically appeared; I repeated the order and she repeated it back just to confirm it was correct. When I came in the order was still incorrect. 

I then explained to another manager, Dylan, that there has been an issue with every order I have had at this location. My first order was lost in delivery, last order came cold and incorrect on the night of the most major fight event in Las Vegas, and now this one. He was very apathetic and left the counter to immediately tell Lynda but then I heard him talking crap. I yelled back to make him aware that I was able to hear his negative comments and suggested that he wait until I left the store."}
{"text":"Ordered online and got a 2 hour window. Called the restaurant and 30 mins later I was told to order somewhere else and reject the delivery when it shows up. 5/5 for meme worthiness but 0/5 for overpriced pizza"}
{"text":"Friday night.  Hungry kids. Mom sick all day. Call for pizza, right?
NOT this location.
We check for the deal we saw advertised on the website.  Website says - \"this location not participating\", so we try another deal..ok...
go through the details on the website.  Get to the end (even though we started with choosing \"carryout\"), it wouldn't let us complete the order as carryout.  
We pitch the online ordering process, call and it takes 30 minutes to get the order right with the incompetence on the phone. We arrive on time.
When we get there to pick it up, the incompetence at the front desk can't find our food because the incompetence on the phone didn't put our name on it.  They tell us obviously we are at the wrong location. Nobody can find our food.  They don't call the other location for us.  Nobody checks with the guy who took the order on the phone.

Husband comes home.  Checks the phone - we had the right location.
I call back.  He's not willing to drive back out there to pay $23 for pizza and breadsticks.  
Manager not willing to take a loss because of their mistakes. 
Cancelled the order - food was wasted (for me, this is worse than incompetence).

I'm still sick - have to get up and make dinner for my kids.  My husband is late for his plans and we're both hungry. Great.  thanks.  Managing incompetence means saying your wrong and taking a loss sometimes... this was a time to take the loss... Gas costs too much for us to have to drive out there twice and then pay for our food on top of that.  Manager didn't apologize.  Expected us to drive back there and pay 80% of the cost - sorry - my time and energy and gas is worth more to me than your 20% is to you.
We order pizza about once a month.  We won't be ordering it from Pizza Hut anymore - certainly not this location."}

I just recently moved to AZ and this was one of my first meals since my big move and i was very happy. Plus the pizza was delicious, thank you noah!"}

{"text":"Pizza hut is Pizza hut right? Service and speed is great but I will say the pizza is so greasy. It drips grease when you pull a piece off. Now that there is a dominoes in town I'll probably being going there."}
{"text":"One star is too generous, never thought ordering pizza could be so dramatic. 

I ordered my pizza online and scheduled it to be delivered at 5:30 (an hour + later). 5:40 rolls around no pizza, I check my phone to make sure the driver isn't lost. They tell me that he already left so he should be there in just a few minutes. 6pm rolls around, I call again (ask to speak with the manager) as I am talking to him the driver pulls up. Driver knocks on my door. At this point I only expected to give him around a 2 dollar tip (lucky to get that much). He then looks at the cash I give him and tells me he doesn't have enough change. So driver ends up getting a 7 dollar tip. And of course the food was cold. Needless to say the driver made out like a bandit. 7 dollar tip for being half hour late and giving me cold food. 

What I find almost comedic is I was doing our first ever pizza and movie night for my family and planned to make this a monthly occurrence. That small order that they probably blew off tonight cost them a monthly order from me and my family :)

I will include that later that night I received a call from the driver, he stated b/c he did not have change the overage that I paid would be credited towards my account. It was very much appreciated however, given the fact that at this point I don't plan on returning it's of no use to me."}
{"text":"Regular pizza hut. I frequent this location. The worst day to go is on Super Bowl Sunday (Lesson learned). Angry customers. I wasn't angry, my food was correct and ready on time, but many people inside were angry (because they ordered at the last minute).

I commend the workers who worked that day, for being able to maintain their composure and continue to provide exemplary service. My breadsticks were actually burned, and I had to take them back but other than that hiccup, everything was good.

Whenever I visit this location, I never have any issues. I'll be glad when they roll out Gluten Free pizza to this location though."}

Let's begin with a useful quote: \"It is what it is.\" 

It's Pizza Hut. But! It's not every Pizza Hut. It's just this one Pizza Hut... and the Pizza Huts of 30+ years ago. (Back when \"Pizza Hut vs. Pizza Inn\" was as likely a topic of contention among friends as \"Coke vs. Pepsi.\") The rushed concoctions bulk-built in those Wingstreet regret factories made for carryout and delivery only? Or worse, the little cafes inside Target stores? Not the same thing.

We visited this Pizza Hut for the first time last month specifically to try the  buffet, something neither of us had tasted in decades but we both had fond memories of. This is the only Pizza Hut left in town that still offers buffet. The next one's in Boulder City. The buffet runs from 10-3 every day and recently was added to Tuesday evenings.

My expectations were as follows: freshly made food, more than one vegetarian option, not too greasy, decent ingredients, courteous service, and a non-skeezy dining atmosphere.

I have no idea why I'm not giving this Pizza Hut a five, honestly. They hit if not surpassed all of the above. Pure snobbery on my part, I think. It's hard to give five stars to a chain with a ripped sofa-bench by the cash register and a grim (but adequately safe and spacious) parking lot, but I'm hard pressed to find anything else to criticize. I guess I can't give it a 5 because it's not my favourite pizza in the valley, but it's in the top five.

The hostess/waitress was genuinely personable and was interested in describing to us how the pizzas were made so they wouldn't be like delivery-style Pizza Hut. The pizzas on the buffet (so many types that they ran out of room to place them) were piping hot and replaced as soon as the tray was empty. Refills on soda came before they were needed. The salad bar was neat, fresh, and beat most Strip buffets in terms of the build-your-own ingredients.

The pizzas themselves were good. I had both cheese pizza and a veggie works. There were five different meat options with varying crusts plus a dessert pizza. On the side was baked pasta,breadsticks, and marinara sauce. Nothing was soggy or greasy about the pizzas, unlike what I order online from my local PH in dark moments of being too tired to leave the sofa. I still prefer Northside Nathan's and Grimaldi's, but this held its own. 

Where else are you going to drop in for a relaxing, casual pizza buffet that lives up to wholesome childhood memories?

(Do *not* say Cici's. Cici's is a playdate flash mob that happens to serve food. At Pizza Hut you can sit, enjoy the meal, and not dodge grotty toddlers under the fluorescent lights.)

Consider this a 4.5 star review that will get evened out when my husband writes his review and gives it a 5. I know, I know: PIZZA HUT. 

Look, we're not comparing it to some eatery at the Cosmopolitan or a micropub with handwritten menus or a big chain with scripted service. It is what it is is. And, if you judge it strictly in the \"affordable, family-friendly (including families without kids) salad/pizza stop in a homey and hospitable environment, with food that, while not amazing, is solid in flavour and reflects preparation and pride in care\" category, what it is is a winner."}
{"text":"I have been using this Pizza Hut for 5 years and the pizzas have been at least good or better. I had a coupon for any pizza for 10 bucks. I called to place my order and the guy I spoke with belittled me for using a coupon. Why entice someone with a deal and then put them down for taking them up on it? I asked if he was going to honor it or not. He grudgingly took my order (I should have quit while I was behind). While driving there I was thinking I should have waited before leaving because I was going to get there and have to wait. I got there and my order was ready. I paid and noticed it seemed a little cold. When I got home and opened it I saw how little good stuff was on my Super Supreme Chicken. It looked like it had been something else and was scrapped off and changed. The cheese was not completely melted. I put a slice in the microwave and had a few bites. There was definitely something wrong with the taste. The next day I tried contacting the owner, but she never got back to me. I guess she doesn't care. I still have the pizza. I think I'll contact the corporate office and see if they give a you know what."}
{"text":"After my physique competition the only way I wanted to celebrate was with a Large Supreme pizza from Pizza Hut and man did I make the right choice. We had ordered 4 pizzas in total: Supreme, Cheese, BBQ chicken, and Mushroom&Pepperoni. I chose the Supreme pizza and added chicken and jalapeños The crust on the original pan pizza is one of the best crusts in the pizza game. The cashier who helped us out also was nice and helped us save some money with the pizza deals so big shoutout to the night time cashier located on Sahara and Ft. Apache. Pizza Hut you are great"}
{"text":"Worst service ever seen we have been to pizza hut before the other ones were so much faster and it was not busy"}
{"text":"After reading old reviews, I was a little hesitant. This is now my second order in two weeks! I ordered double cut, light sauce...I'm picky. These pizzas looked better than the commercials. The place was clean and the people were professional, courteous, and quick. They know what they're doing. Definitely my go to dinner place. Thanks so much!"}
{"text":"I don't normally review take-out places, and rarely do I eat pizza , but I did have to remark that the service and quality of this particular Pizza Hut was outstanding! The food was hot and ready in no time, and they have one menu item on their $5 dollar menu that is just the pure devil, it's that good. I'm talking about their hot and gooey brownie. Omg, it is to die for. I'm sure it's not good for you, but let me say, the taste of this brownie, especially hot is pure Heaven. Price is always right as well."}
{"text":"Disappointed . First of all I got delivery and online it said they will deliver by 8:48 pm and they didn't come until 9:15 pm I ordered around 7:45 pm. ( I live 5 minutes from this location ) 
The pizza / breadsticks very cold and stale. The chicken bites and ceaser salad was ok. First and last time getting delivery from Pizza Hut well from that location ."}
{"text":"Asked for a pizza on their menu, apparently they didn't make it anymore? Gave us a different pizza instead."}
{"text":"I've never been more disappointed with customer service. This place tried to blame us for their delivery guy calling the wrong number. We gave them a second chance and they failed us again with poor service. NOT THE SPOT TO ORDER FROM. Rude, unprofessional, and I'd comment on the food but we didn't even receive it. These are not the humans you want to trust with your Friday night appetite."}
{"text":"The absolute worst experience with any business. Went to pick up my order and the manager Terry was working behind the counter. Instead of a hello or welcome, we were greeted by a \"I'll get somebody else to help you!\". He was extremely rude and unprofessional and I feel very bad for his workers. It became immediately clear that he was not having a good night or life. He is a horrible representation of the brand, I will stay away from this location and also recommend for everyone else to also stay away. Worst experience ever and I was tempted to cancel my order and walk out."}
{"text":"I was wandering around aimlessly hoping to find something I haven't eaten in a while. I found this Pizza Hut, it was either that or the nearby Taco Bell. I should have chosen the Taco Bell. I was greeted by a pleasant young lady who's nice smile and perky demeanour earned the only star in this restaurant. 
There was a special, buy a large pizza, 5 toppings for 16 bucks. Not much of a special but that plus the twelve dollar add on for a two litre of pop, breadsticks and 8 wings. (The sign saying ten wings was covered over with a sharpie marker saying eight. Cheap out two wings because calgarians will pay more right?)
15 minutes for it to be ready, I sat down. Twenty minutes later I stood up so I don't get forgotten about. Three minutes after that I got my food handed to me. It was sitting in the warming tray, they forgot I was sitting there...
On the way home I ate the breadsticks. The marinara was tastey but the breadsticks not too fresh and not too flavourful.
The pizza was pretty good and I was satisfied.
The boneless wings were poorly put together. It was like someone took some chicken nuggets, and threw its dipping sauce in the box. (See photo ) The advertisement shows the boneless wings to be smothered in sauce, like they are tossed in a bowl to coat every bit of it. It's not a hard process, I can do it at home. When you pay 12 bucks for wings, two litre pop, and a version of crazy bread, it should taste good. Not make you wish you had gone to costco and make it yourself. 

Honestly, this negative review would not be online if I hadn't felt like they rip you off on wings and breadsticks. I mean come on, writing over the number 10 with 8. Then seeing him dump two bags into the fryer minus the two he took out by hand. (Meaning each bag is sold with five, and intended to have 5 per serving, not 4, for every other Pizza Hut in canada) plus they took no care in saucing them. 
Anyways, one day I will give this location another chance, and hopefully I will amend my review, but considering its store policy to give you less than everywhere else in canada, I doubt their generosity will increase anytime soon."}
{"text":"So the old saying that pizza is good even when it's bad does not count when it comes to this Pizza Hut. I've been there twice but this is the first time I ordered food. Let me explain... The first time I went I just went in to ask a few questions. The girl at the counter acted like I was ruining her day asking her about pizza and how long it usually take to cook an order. I should have stuck with my first instinct and never went back. But we thought we give it a try. BIG MISTAKE!!! I ordered online 2 pizzas one bacon one pepperoni, no weird order right? Well I get a ham/bacon pizza when I call back I get well we ran out of bacon. Second I have never had a pizza that I had to wait for to come out of the oven be cold by the time I get home( I live a mile away).  Third, the crust was not cooked all the way. I got back totaling to wait for it out of the oven. It was so undercooked it didn't even cut. I had to put it in the pizzaz. Didn't know my order was a cook at home special. If I could give this place and that girl a zero it still wouldn't do it justice."}
{"text":"This restaurant is very dirty. Staff is never pleasant to customers, and the food is over priced."}
{"text":"Wow... total and complete incompetence of the lady taking my phone order for delivery!!!  I was staying at a hotel literally 3 blocks away.  I'm sure they deliver there all the time.  I had to spell out every word of my order, literally spell it out.  
And had to correct her 3 time on what i had ordered.  \"Pan\" and \"thin\" don not sound that much alike to get that incorrect do they?  
In order \"garlic sticks\" she says we don't have \"garlic sticks\" only \"garlic bread\"!   Really you can't relate that as the same.  Look at them, they are \"sticks\".
I am sorry for the next caller to have to go through this pain."}
{"text":"Worst pizza I've had in a long time. Ordered the cheese bite pizza got there ahead of the time it was due to be out. Guy handed it to me out of the warm oven he opened it pizza looked like it was baked last week got it home it tasted like cardboard and was cold. A waist of $15.00 bucks. Best part of this whole order was the marinara sauce for the cheesy crust. I'll never buy from there again. BAD!!!! Papa Murphy pizza is hell of a lot better even if you have to cook it yourself."}
{"text":"The worst delivery system ever! Twice in a row. Awful! Never, ever ordering from this location again!"}
{"text":"The food at this location gave my Wife and I food poisoning in early 2015. I called to tell them this and their reply was just \"ok...\". No apology or even attempt at sympathy; amazing."}
{"text":"So its be been 1 hour and 5 min. Still haven't got my order and I only live 3.1 miles away from there location .   I called in twice for my order both time they said the guy is around the corner he is gonna be there soon.

Hey location manager u r representing a big company get on to it.  Look at ur review hire some good driver or if u can't make  delivery and make pizza in 55 min.  Sell your company to dominos  even if they r 4.5 miles away they deliver before 45 min 
Worse ever super mad"}
{"text":"These clowns are total knuckle heads. They ran our order as take out and then wouldnt change it to delivery even though it was supposed to be, even though we tried to give them money for the delivery charge, even though it was their fault. They lied about being sorry for not being able to help. They lied by saying its impossible to write an address down on paper and give it to a sentient being driving for their deliveries.  maybe thats the problem..maybe they dont have humans driving? Wow that'd be something. With the kinda dough you need to hire a robot delivery tank army no wonder they dont give a holy fuck about customer service. Total dipshits.
Anyway now Im killing time in this dirty-floored ghetto grease bucket with knappy-ass street freaks pacing back and forth in front of the windows.
Dudes name is Jacob."}
{"text":"I have nothing but empathy  for those who eat this and somehow said yes this is pizza and passes for food the deals shouldn't matter how fast it gets here or how nice the staff might be  bottom line this \"pizza\" is terrible from the pre frozen  flavorless crust to the bland marinara and the least amount of cheese witnessed on a pizza but hey straight from there ceos mouth convenience trumps quality"}
{"text":"Worst Pizza Hut in Charlotte! Ordered pizza hours in advance for pick up at 6:45pm. It is 7:15pm and we are still waiting for our pizza."}
{"text":"It's okay. I wasn't treated poorly but also not treated greatly. I had a voucher otherwise I would have went to a local pizza shop."}
{"text":"Now officially done with this store for sure and probably Pizza Hut as well. The store is 10 minutes from our house yet they can't seem to get a pie to us in less than an hour. Tonight it was an hour and a half. The crust is like cardboard and the pie was lukewarm at best. 

Avoid at all costs."}
{"text":"I always love Pizza Hut and this one is no different.  Very friendly staff, quick and courteous.  Tried the new seasoned crusts and they were awesome."}
{"text":"Food is great but customer service is HORRIBLE!!!! Their staff needs CUSTOMER SERVICE TRAINING!!!!! The girl working the front on 11/23/2014 8pm shift was beyond rude.!!!!!"}
{"text":"First and foremost, I need to acknowledge an amazing employee named Jen who went above and beyond for myself and my boyfriend. 

So I call this location on Friday 03/23 at 11:40pm to ask if they're still accepting online orders and the person on the phone says yes but only for pickup and we HAVE to be there by midnight. She was very clear about that. No problem. So my boyfriend goes running out the door while I place the order on my app. Well my dumbass makes the order for SATURDAY night at 11:45, which means Pizza Hut never got the order, which means the ovens were turned off before my boyfriend got there. 

Unfortunately, the news is devastating; there's not much they can do other than give us some wings. Oh well. That's my bad for screwing that up. But while my boyfriend is on the phone with me letting me know what's going on, in walks Jen who offers to make the order anyway. She offers to stay late (when she did not have to) just to make these last pizzas for us. Not all heroes wear capes, y'all. 

This goes beyond just exemplary customer service. This was a true act of kindness and I am so appreciative of that. Thank you so much!!!"}
{"text":"This is the worst Pizza Hut in town. They just cannot get an order right. Pizza Hut used to be my favorite spot but these people just cannot get it right.  Pizza is always under cooked. I specified in my order \"well done\" but my crust is still soft and my bread sticks are light AF. I hadn't ordered from this spot in more than 6 months but was craving breadsticks today and the F'd it up!"}
{"text":"This Pizza Hut location is awesome. The staff is fast and friendly and I'm always in and out when picking up or even when ordering and waiting. If you walk in you'll probably be walking out with your pizza in 15 min or less. Usually I order online for carryout and my order is always ready when I show up. Never had a problem with an order and my order is always fresh and tasty. Go for a large pan w/ half pepperoni and half pork sausage; which is my go to order. This is one of the better locations for fast carryout pizzas"}
{"text":"I just called and try to ordered a pizza, worst customer service. So I'm taking my business elsewhere"}
{"text":"I should have regarded the ratings. The cashier/pizza maker, had all of the documentation needed to processes my businesses order and got it wrong. He claimed he \"didnt know what that was\". 

After he thanked me, acknowledging the receipt of my tax exempt info, processes the sale as normal, I bring his attention to the tax exempt info, he's clueless on how to fix it, his manager shows up, says he's never seen one before and then blamed me because he did his job wrong. Never returning."}
{"text":"One of the best looking Pizza Huts I've ever seen. It seems like they take pride in their restaurant. The customer service is amazing. They let us 10 min before opening and allowed us to order. The staff have a smile on their face - genuine, not plastic fake grins.

The pizza was hot and fresh, although I will say that it's the greasiest I've had. You couldn't take a slice without the oil dripping all over the place."}
{"text":"The \"food\" is awful and the service is even worse. Just trying to get a seat and be served is an arduous experience. Then you have to wait, and wait for the plates of cold, stodgy carbs, I gave it a second chance, and that was it...never again.
 Honestly, I can only conclude this is a way for organized crime to launder its ill gotten gains; there is no other way to explain why it still exists."}
{"text":"After trying another pizza place recently i was left a little paranoid of trying a new place and just wanted something more familliar and dependable, so i chose to order from Pizza Hut.  Their standards and quality jive with what i like as opposed to the last place i tried.  So it costs a bit more, but its good stuff.  It arrived on time, i got what i ordered, and i was satisfied and happy, and that is all you can ask for.  Since i was looking for something to hit the spot, this did the trick.  The dough was light, the sauce was delicious, the chicken strips and peperoni were fresh, the onions still had some bite to them, so its all good, but i must say, it was just as good for breakfast the next day.  Pizza is one of the greatest foods i have ever had and customizable for any mood I'm in.  But some pizza is better than others, and this one defiantely works for me."}
{"text":"I will not be ordering from Pizza Hut ever again. After a long day of yard work my fiancé and I thought it would be a good idea to order pizza seeing as we have order from here before. After spending 30 bucks on pizza, wings, and a soda, I am very unhappy.
I ordered online and left a note in the designated area stating to park in the street as our driveway is too short to fit two vehicles. What did the delivery driver do? HE PARKED ON OUR LAWN. The lawn we are trying to grow new grass on..Then, he proceeds to hand us the wings first which are in completely smashed container. Next, he hands us our pizza which is covered in wing sauce, but forgot our soda.
Once he left and we opened the pizza and wings, the food was barely warm and as it stands, he has still not come back with our soda.
Absolutely aggravating when I spent 30 bucks on food I could have spent somewhere to get good, hot food and my lawn would be intact."}
{"text":"Gross pizza, better than pizza pizza, but still quite terrible,

its just gross. Toronto, you can do better."}
{"text":"After trying to order my pizza from Dominos and being unsuccessful, I turned to Pizza Hut. They helped me right away and I ended up getting more food for less money. They also delivered my food within a half an hour and it was hot and ready to eat when I got it. The delivery guy was very friendly and warm as well. I ordered their wings for the first time today and they were super yummy. I definitely will be ordering Pizza Hut from now on and will be ordering wings from them again on the 50 cent wing night."}
{"text":"I have to say, this is my favourite pizza chain and for a good reason. That deep dish style pizza with a crispy, fried crust and fresh white mozzarella is so distinct in flavour and texture. Simply delectable. Thank you for staying exactly the same and bringing back all of those tasty childhood memories. :)"}
{"text":"Had a really bad experience with calling in my order here. The person on the phone was rude because of his condescending comments. Comments that weren't necessary to express. When I called back to  create an additional note to the order he made a mistake, didn't own up to it, and blamed it on a different representative. It was the same representative because his voice and comments were recognizable. I understand that he could've had a bad day, or the job itself is just not fulfilling his happiness which shows through his tone of voice, but as GENERAL MANAGER of the store I would expect his customer service to be the best and to give a great example to his employees around him. 

KENNY, if you're reading this comment I know you can do better in your services for taking orders over the phone. The coupon/discount you offered and added to my order is a great start. Please strive for offering a better customer experience for the betterment of your work ethic and to show your employees the right way to take orders over the phone. If you disregard this comment then this position is not for you."}
{"text":"I would give a lower score if there was one. I'm not from around Las Vegas and I looked up a Pizza Hut near me in Las Vegas. It took me to this one with a phone number that is, apparently, not their real number. She took my order and before I gave her my cc #, she hung up. I tried to call again and it wasn't pizza hut, it was from a random woman. How could pizza hut allow google to advertise the wrong number???? Stupid!"}
{"text":"I hate the call Center I had them send me to the actual Pizza Hut and there's no answer call center takes 3 hours no thanks"}
{"text":"I receive my confirmation email as I always do and it gives me the time my delivery should arrive. Granted I always give them wiggle room. I live maybe 2 miles from this location and only getting a phone call from pizza hut 45 minutes after my food was expected to arrive is a far stretch. Then to call back with no answer I decided to call their store to be waiting on hold for 15 min & getting disconnected and the second time finally getting through after another 15 min.

The guy on the phone said \"oh, yeah we're a little backed up now\". So they sent me my food for free. It has now been 2 hours after my original delivery time and I still have nothing. Not even a phone call. The reason I ordered delivery is because I have no transportation, now I have no food. I'm so upset & starving. I have never experienced this kind of unprofessional treatment. Oh now my food arrives,  cold, wings are not crispy and the bread sticks literally were cold and nothing like they are supposed to be. Horrible quality."}
{"text":"If I could give you negative stars I would. Just got our pizza and the hand tossed is more like under done pan. It wasn't cut on half of it and the grease was out of control even for Pizza Hut. Never again."}
{"text":"Okay, Pizza Hut used to be pretty good good, but now I must say this location is pathetic.
truly, any corporate owned pizza place that continuously has delivery times of two to four hours is just sad, it's either so horribly mismanaged that they can't even simply function and do their work work, or they are a corporation that cares so little about expanding or creating new locations that they think people would actually pay money and wait four hours for a mediocre Pizza.
Here's the good news, it creates many opportunities for locally owned businesses to come in and provide a better product and service, perhaps even eliminating poorly run corporate businesses that care only for their profit and not for the their customers.
Try sub Corral, locally-owned, better Pizza, delivers within an hour every time!"}
{"text":"Out of all the Pizza Huts we've ordered from across the country, THIS location is BY FAR the VERY BEST for MANY reasons!! 

The flavor, freshness and overall quality is spot-on, balanced delicious!  Our usual orders consist of two pizzas, hand-tossed crust, regular sauce, hut favorite flavor, regular amount of cheese and one with extra pineapple, the other with extra pepperoni. We always use the app to order and there's never any difficulty doing so. Our order is usually at our door in 23 - 32 minutes. It arrives hot and picture perfect. On the RARE occasion that there was a problem, the situation was handled  professionally and quickly without question or hassle. ALL the drivers have been VERY crisp, clean, quick, professional and personable. 

It is VERY CLEAR the leadership of THIS location cares about every customer experience and knows the value of hiring and training an amazing team that is consistent and thorough across the board. 

Because of THIS location we have ordered more pizza in the past three months than we have from other companies over the past three YEARS!"}
{"text":"This place SUCKS!!! Worst Pizza Hut on the planet earth...ordered from there 2 times and both times were Disgusting! Wings were RAW!! Also pizza was not hot when it arrived! Don't ever go here."}
{"text":"Delivery order that reminded me that Pizza Hut is not the pizza place it used to be. The pizza dough was too thin. The stuffed crust was tasteless and the entire thing was under cooked. The wings were tiny. The breadsticks were cold and un-impressive. Oh and it was expensive, 40.00+ for a large pie 12 wings and 5 breadsticks. Sorry but there are so many pizza places you have to do better than this."}
{"text":"Unfortunately we got a used Band-Aid baked into the crust of our pizza. We ordered two pizzas, of course they went straight in the trash. Unfortunately we had already eaten some. You can't even imagine. We won't be eating pizza again for a long time."}
{"text":"Placed order on online. . We ordered a 2 liter pepsi with our order and sent my son to get the order. . He came home without  it. . We called and contacted the manager and she said it was not their fault because there is a cooler out front and he shouldve grabbed it even though he didn't know what we ordered.  When i said so u r blaming us and she said no i am not but it on u is not our responsibility to get the soda. She told me the call was being recorded so her corporate can listen and i said good. . Then i went in to get my pepsi and there were three guys standing at the front counter trying to intimidate me and I went in got the soda they didnt give me and left. . Just wanted what i ordered."}
{"text":"Poor customer service! I was told 15 minutes for my personal pizza, it has been 30 minutes and still nothing. I remember why I do not come here. The wait is too much. Best to place an order literally an hour before you get hungry. Let's hope this is worth the wait."}
{"text":"Less if I could. Worst management  and customer service ever!!!  Had a $10.00 off coupon code for my online order they refused to honor. Talked with Keith so called manager and he wouldn't honor it saying I was using two coupons. I said no I just ordered 2 regular pizzas and he stilled refused and wanted to argue with me. I said good cancel my entire order I'm calling dominos!!"}
{"text":"Lunch, mmm pizza.  But these guys were pretty slow.  I ordered a personal pan pizza, and it was smaller than i thought but it was good tasting, Overall, i wasnt as impressed as i thought i would be.  it was good, as far as food quality, but the service was mighty average at best and the portion sizing didnt make me think i had a deal and i kinda wished i ordered something else.  I will try them again some other time and see if i have better success or find something more satisfying.  Looking forward to round 2"}
{"text":"Ordered my food 2 1/2 hours ago called and still hadn't made my order. This is pathetic"}
{"text":"Only one star for this visit..stopped in at 9:30pm to place an order to go...wanted a small thin crust meat lovers pizza with everything on it for my wife and me. We got a Box Meal consisting of a cheese pan pizza (thick crust, no meat), cinnamon sticks and cheesy garlic bread sticks and wings. Dunno where it all got lost in translation but I'll use the app next time and forego the human face to face interaction..smh"}
{"text":"I have been ordering here for a about 2 years now. And every single time I order they make it perfectly and on time. Pizza and Wings both! Keep it up! :) Thank you! :)"}
{"text":"When I got home to eat my pizza it barely had any cheese, banana peppers and pepperoni. Next time I'll pay the extra fee for more toppings, if I ever from here again."}
{"text":"Nice staff. It can get hectic here especially on weekends. I always drive to pick up so I haven't tried their delivery. I would recommend the thin crust pizzas. They do put a healthy amount of toppings on the pizza. 

Prices are fair."}
{"text":"I have ordered plenty from the Dominos app but decided to try PizzaHut this time. Placed my order easily online and even requested 2 plastic cups w the 2 liter and they brought it! Dominos can't even remember to bring the ranch when purchased. I have ordered several times now from this location and all has been great. They were 1 hr and 15 m in getting here last time when online said 40 mins. Didn't complain about it, but next day I had an email from them offering a free pizza next time for being late. Impressed!"}
{"text":"It's pizza Hut.  You get the same regardless of the city you're in. This restaurant meets expectations at least for the delivery. I did not try to eat in the location.

One thing that pizza Hut did that is really great is that on delivery service you can track live where your pizza is at in the making process or follow the car on a map. And I was surprised but it's actually pretty accurate. I was impressed for that.

As for the food, it's what I expect from pizza Hut. It's a pizza that tastes good without being the best ever."}
{"text":"Does anyone else have an issue with them NEVER having parmesan or chili pepper flakes?! Honestly every time we go they never have them. Claiming they are all out (they even pull out the little empty brown box from under the front counter). Well got damn it,  clearly you arent ordering enough inventory seeing how you never have any. Pretty ridiculous. Oh and delivery guys never have any either. FML"}
{"text":"The meat primo taste awful and the wings tasted burnt spicy barbecue wings and they forgot the Pepsi 2 liters and manager offers breadsticks and I request wings just poor food and poor service that is it ordering from dominos here on out pizza hut can't get their shit together especially at the painesville store"}
{"text":"Absolutely terrible customer service. The staff answering the phone has no clue what's going on. Do yourself a favor and go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Pizza Hut was the best location for lunch at high school.  It was virtually a cheap pizza party each week.  We would  always compete to see the person capable of downing 12 slices, pasta, bread sticks and as much Mountain Dew as possible in a very limited amount of time.  Sure the pizza wasn't great, but it was the only joint offering a buffet of pizza... so it was more than good enough.

Since high school, I have frequented Pizza Hut less and less.  Maybe it started with obnoxious menu item, \"P'Zone\".  I think it had more to do with valuing my calorie intake with higher quality and better tasting heart attack inducing sustenance.  

Yesterday, I jogged my way back to 1993... those wonderful school days of scarfing down food in a pizza trough.  Pizza Hut!!

Gone are the days I could be carefree enough to gorge on 12+ slices of pie.  When you're in your late 30's, moderation is regrettably key.  

The restaurant is full sized (like the junk in my trunk following the feast). It was clean and well-maintained. I was seated immediately.  The pleasant server came within a minute and smiled while she paved the way to rekindling my glutinous memories of the pizza days of yore. 

The restaurant was very busy and the pizza was well-stocked with so many varieties.  Off the top of my head there was a thin crust cheese and pan versions of; barbecue, supreme, sausage and 'shroom and many more.  There was also some cheesy alfredo pasta dish, cheese bread and cinnamon and cherry dessert streusel pizza.  

The flavor of the conveyor belt pizza was pretty much the same as it ever was.  This location was better than most because the pies were hot, not rushed through the pizza assembly line (in other locations, I have been issues with goopy under-cooked dough). 

The buffet was unbelievably cheap - $7 or so.  I believe in 1993 it was $5.49 or 
$5.99, so the price point is very friendly to their customers.  

As far as my ability to eat vs. my former self... it was no contest.  Yesterday, I ended up that I was only comfortable snagging water, six slices, a scoop of pasta and no cheesy bread or dessert.  Of course the 17/18 year-old-me would have openly mocked and ridiculed me for being a wuss."}
{"text":"I'm literally going to hold this until I get my delivery, however....I've always had a great experience. I input my credit card number wrong. The driver called me and I asked for him to please hang on while I verified. He hung up on me, told his boss that he called me 4 times and I never responded. That's a lie. The manager was rude, when I immediately called back to rectify the situation. I made a mistake online. No need for the sass."}
{"text":"Stupid. Thats it just plain dumb.

So I call, place the order. He said 2 toppings on 2 mediums $6.99 each, good deal, He says \"im going to call u in 15 min. If you dont answer we are canceling the order\" 
I asked so when will it be ready? 
He says 15 min. 

Ok so my phone dies so i drive over get there just in time. He says , i called u and u didnt pick up so we didnt place the order. 
I said, but u said it was going to be ready in 15 min so here i am. 
He said well its because you were a first time customer so i had to call u first before we make the pizzas. 

Uhhh isnt the whole point about me calling to place the order because i did want the pizza? Why would u have to call me back to confirm? That doesnt make sense. 

Silence..  

I leave take my business to another pizza hut he says $6.99 each for 2 mediums and whatever toppings. Even better. 

Byyeee felicia!"}
{"text":"Great service! 

Pizza smells so good. 
Taste great. 

Just overall a good experience after the lame experience from the one down the street."}
{"text":"As far as Pizza Huts go, this one is rather meh. More than once, we've shown up shortly after the store was supposed to open and found the doors locked - sometimes as late as 30 minutes past opening. The servers are often forgetful - ignoring drinks that need refills, not bothering to write orders down and then getting them wrong, etc. And about 75% of the time, we have to send the pizza back for the crust topper that we ordered WITH the pizza."}
{"text":"This Pizza Hut is pretty hit or miss on service. Every time we stop by, we dine in. Usually, the food is pretty good, but there have been times when they've forgotten about food that we ordered. I've had my appetizer come out AFTER my food because I had to remind my waitress that I had ordered the appetizer in the first place.

Additionally, they're very stingy about the pizza sized boxes for leftovers. We've been told \"It doesn't fit in everyone's fridges\" as an excuse for why we can't have a medium box to take our leftovers home in. Um... we wouldn't ask for a pizza box if it didn't fit in our fridge."}
{"text":"Each and every time I pickup a pizza here, I feel like I'm entering Chuck-E-Cheese. There is NEVER anyone up front, which I don't know how many staff are on at any given time of day, but if you have a list of 12 pizzas on the board, 5 of which are showing READY, I would suggest maybe having someone float near the front waiting for people entering the store?  This particular night, I walked in and noticed a male worker near the front, ignored me, and walked to the back. Shortly after, I heard a, \"I'll be right there!!!\" from the back. Hmm..ok?  This was followed by giggling and bantering about how that statement could have also been said, to which said loud mouth replied asking if Yoo Hoo, Hold on a second, would be more appropriate?  Laughing afterwards again. When a human finally appeared at the register after my 5 minute wait, she asked my name and must have noticed I was not amused, and her tone changed.  I asked her to add dipping sauce onto my order and she said, no worries, gave me the same total. Ok...   I gave my card, and he got my pizza, asked if I needed anything else, and I said the blue cheese?  She started getting grated cheese, and I asked again for the blue cheese, to which she must have forgotten (giggle giggle), and got two for me. 
I don't mind having fun at work, but don't do it in front of customers waiting, and who may or may not have had a shitty day.  It's not amusing.  These workers act like children, and this is not the first time I've encountered this at this location.  I order from here because it's convenient for me from where I live and I know the consistency of Pizza hut pizza.   If these workers don't care about their customers, I can only worry that they don't care about the food they're preparing either and I'll be utilizing local, non-chain pizza places going forward. I've also sent a complaint to corporate.  Lesson?  Don't piss off someone who has had a shitty day by making them wait around and then acting like clowns.


UPDATE: I received an email from corporate addressing the issue and apologizing saying they would contact the store manager. I received a phone call from the store manager apologizing and offering a $15 credit to my account which is valid only at this location. I am not positive I will use this as I don't trust the workers there. If they see this credit, what would they do to my order?  Very generous solution, and I thanked her, but probably won't be using that credit."}
{"text":"This review should be 4 stars but i gave 5 to counter the punitive 1 stars some other patrons have left. Very unfair! 

So what do you expect when you order pizza hut? Well that's what you get, along with service-with-a-smile. The first time I ordered pickup from here, I called the order in 15 mins before close. Khris had helped me and he was still in an upbeat mood and happy to help me, even joking around some, all after their posted hours (my pickup time was 11:04). That attitude set the tone for me to order again. The first pie was a little soft, so on my second visit i got the pizza \"well done\", which made it as crispy as I prefer. Give this place a shot, they are surely not two stars- at least not in-store. I have yet to order delivery.."}
{"text":"They always do a good job.  We had an issue one time where our \"extra cheese pizza\" really didn't have extra cheese.  They gave us credit for our next visit.  I appreciated that."}
{"text":"My son's play youth football out here in the valley, and I figured for there last game of the season I would order them pizza for there after game snacks. I am at work so I had to order online and have it delivered to the high school they were playing at. I made the order online, and then called the store to ask them about how long and to explain to them which football team we were what side of the feild. The person who answered the phone was very distant didn't seem to care and seemed like I was a bother to him. When I tried to explain the instructions to him he just CUT ME OFF and said mam the driver will call you when he's there. I was like of he's like ok bye! Then the DRIVER calls me (omg) I try to explain to him the team mom is out there during the game and asked if he could walk it out there for us (he would have got a fat tip!) And he's like ummm no not really i don't want to walk over there can you have someone come out. It's not a long walk its literally right in front. Customer service was HORRRRRRIBBBBLLLLLEEEEEEEEE! Two stars because they were quick."}
{"text":"Ordered Pizza from here, provided my postal code, for some reason the system picked a restaurant location that is very far away from my house, instead of picking the location that is closer to us. After I placed the order, I never got an email confirmation, so I decided to call them and confirm that my order has been placed. After waiting on the line for 5 minutes, nobody picked up the phone at 1086 Yonge street, instead I got transferred to the call centre. At the call centre they transferred me to the \"Online Services\" department,  and told me that they can't track the online orders for some reason. \"Online Services\" department on their part, transferred me back to the call centre - this back and forth transferring happening for 8 times in a row. I feel like the only thing that call centre is capable of doing is transferring calls, saying Thank you and We Apologize! Anyway its bizarre, will not be ordering from here anymore, this is unacceptable."}
{"text":"ABSOLUTELY DISGUSTING FOOD. Will never eat here again. First off I spent 70 dollars on food, I get home the pizza is all dried up, my breadsticks are hard, and then to make it even better A HAIR IN MY PASTA. Completely disgusted with this place. Wish I could get my money back and never eat here again. SAVE YOUR MONEY!!"}
{"text":"Epic fail after epic fail. Make sure you turn on your oven to reheat your food.  Waited 20 minutes past the ready time for food. Watched an employee set it on the counter and walk away, leaving it for 10 minutes. I guess they need it to cool before giving it to you. 

These issues have been going on since we moved to the area a little over a year ago. 

I order $150-$200 of pizza from pizza hut every month for work and home. The pizza hut near my office is great so im not sure why these guys have issues. Maybe they have no internal audit procedures. 

Not recommended. Will not use this location again."}
{"text":"I'm a little torn here. I wasn't too happy with the Pizza Hut portion of this place, but I was happy with the Taco Bell portion.

Let me explain. The Hubster and I were feeling gross on a Saturday afternoon. What better way to deal with this than by putting garbage into our stomachs? We decided that since it's been years since we had Pizza Hut, we'd go for it. We came down and ordered two pizzas on hand-tossed crusts. It was a deal, so why not?

While we were waiting, we got a two chicken soft taco combo in the Taco Bell/KFC takeout area. I know. We're disgusting. For some reason, the combo was a full $2 less than advertised, but the bill was completely correct. No complaints here. Fries were just as I remembered them, and so were the tacos (which they easily made dairy-free for me). It's not the best food, but it's Taco Bell. You know what to expect. Drinks were refillable. 

We finally got our pizzas and brought them home. The hand-tossed dough was incredibly disappointing. We should have gone with the regular crust, which I recall being almost deep-fried. The crust was also super sweet for some reason. The pizza wasn't even better the next day. We lamented our decision.

Service at both the Pizza Hut dining room and the Taco Bell/KFC fast food spot were very friendly and accommodating. I'm genuinely concerned that I may have reawakened my love of Taco Bell, despite being able to fight it off for so many years.

Don't know if I'll be back, but one rarely actually plans to be incredibly hungover.

Oh, and Pizza Hut still has a dinner buffet. I mean, holy crap!"}
{"text":"I have ordered from this Pizza Hut THREE times hoping that each time they redeemed themselves, and each time was a fail! The first time I ordered they were quick and fast, but my pizza was a hot a** mess! Super sloppy, looked like it had been thrown around... The second time I ordered online and signed up for text notifications.... 30 mins after I ordered I got a text saying my pizza was out for delivery, 30 minutes AFTER receiving the text I had to call and question about why my pizza wasn't delivered! The girl who answered the phone was rude and seem to not care that my pizza was still not delivered. When it finally showed up, it was missing the marinara sauce for my cheesy bites and had the wrong drink...the 3rd time I ordered, last week, was the final straw! I once again ordered online.. Before the store opened, thinking that if I'm first I'll be getting a good fresh pizza.. WRONG! I put in the time delivery to be sent at 11:45am.. My pizza did not arrive until12:50.. I ordered Two stuffed crust pizzas with extra sauce yada yada toppings and breadsticks...my crust was stuffed but that was it.. Absolutely NO sauce was on either pizza.. My toppings was wrong, the rest of the pizza , aside from the crust, was flat as a piece of paper and my breadsticks were cold and stale! I stay TWO minutes away from this location, there's no reason for them to consistently be late, and f*** up my orders! So if you wanna pay for a trash, have it THEIR way pizza, by all means order from this location. If not... RUN!!!!"}

{"text":"Honestly wish it was possible to give a negative rate to this location. I called to complain about my pizza having a whole fly melted into it and the GM Jospeh sounded so sarcastic while helping me. He said he'd like to hear the \"truth\" in my voice because he receives a lot of suspicious calls about people lying about their pizzas. 
I don't have time to make up some story to get money back or a free pizza! I called because this is disgusting, I normally don't order from this location and this is the first and last time."}
{"text":"I could go on and on about the poor pizza but they already have lots of BAD, well deserved, reviews. The recording says you can get a credit for next visit but the employee only said to come back. They know they making nasty pizzas. Fix the oven or train your cook or geezz lock the door and go home."}
{"text":"Worst customer service experience of my life. Staff is unbelievably rude. The manager was literally hiding from me and the rest of the customers, and completely put off because after waiting 30 minutes past the \"estimated time,\" I wanted my money back. 

The staff member literally said \"I'm only here to pay for college.\" I called to try to get the manager's name but was put on a perpetual hold. I hung up after 10 minutes (screenshot below). 

Pizza Hut should be embarrassed to have this store representing their name. I don't know that I would ever return to a Pizza Hut again because of this one store, and will NEVER put myself through an experience at this particular store again."}
{"text":"I came here last week on Thursday after a loooooong few days at work and let me tell you sweet Caitlyn (I'm almost sure that was her name) made my day! She was efficient, kind and very helpful. She told me about the specials and didn't make me stop ordering when the phone rang (apparently there is a backup phone person. I also watched her handle a customer complaint with professionalism and courtesy. Cheers to her! Give her a raise/promotion ASAP Pizza Hut!!!"}
{"text":"I usually don't like going to Pizza Hut because the customer service is terrible. Tonight I received the most delightful experience EVER at this location. Jasmin set a new bar tonight from beginning to end. Jasmin YOU ROCK!"}
{"text":"I have ordered here countless times and it's always been good. Tonight was the best and I wanted to say thank you. From the ease of ordering and paying online, to all the new options and possible combinations, to the speed and professionalism of the delivery man. By the way, the pizza was delicious too."}
{"text":"I stopped in and grabbed 14 wings - mild buffalo. They told me it would be a 15 minute wait and it was about 3. So good job there. My wings were decent. Nothing near the quality of some of the local bars who turn out some quality chicken for the same price. 

I ate in the store and it wasn't the most appealing place ever. Not enough chairs for the tables, a little dingy. More like a waiting area than eating area.

I haven't tried their pizza yet but I suspect the same - tasty but slightly overpiced and not as good as some of the private shops."}
{"text":"Back in the day if you grew up in central Etobicoke you'd know this mall (666 Burnhamthorpe) as \"B-Mall\".  Back in the day this mall used to have a stand alone Pizza Hut right at the corner in a full sit down restaurant.  That was way back in the day.  

Today this Pizza Hut I speak of is now a the stand alone LCBO store, well renovated not in the same footprint but the same spot.  The Pizza Hut that inhabited this mall at the corner of Burnhamthorpe and Saturn is now part of the strip mall tucked away along the long line of shops in this rather busy commercial area on the cusp of the Mississauga border in west central Etobicoke.

They happen to deliver but I don't know what their footprint range is.  I think that they don't go north of Rathburn because I remember my brother not being able to get delivery but that was years ago.  Rathburn and Renforth is seriously just ONE major block north of this mall.  Perhaps they go as north as Eglinton?  No idea really.  This store really has no seating for dining, it's no longer a sit down place which is obvious by the fact that there are no tables, chairs but just a bench to wait for your orders etc.  Today it's rather a pick up, walk-in, and delivery storefront.

The storefront has been modernized however.  The interior has changed from the once bright  yellow to a more stony look and tone.  It's like all those new McD's that have changed from plastic to looking like many homes in Atlanta or Woodbridge... it's hard to explain really but it no longer seems so dated.  

I so rarely go to Pizza Hut but either way I can't really say I love it.  I mean they're good but can be rather greasy at times.  Pan pizza can do that I suppose.  The quality these days doesn't seem to be as it once was or at least how I remember it.  They don't seem to skimp on ingredients but it just doesn't look like it did before.  It's no longer the same type of place and this batch of pizzas were just... different.  Hard to say, perhaps the cheese was too bubbly?  Regardless there was a special going on which was unexpected.  

Oh wait I do remember the last time I patronized this place.  It was to pick up wings for Superbowl years ago.  I don't even remember which one but it was at least 4 or 5 years if not more...  I remember their wings being good which is why I came this time, to buy wings.  I just happened to buy pizza too because they had the 5 bucks special which is buy a medium or large at regular price and get any medium pizzas (up to 3 more) for 5 bucks each.  That's not a bad deal.

The wings have a variety of sauces to select from and while they come in a variety of ways (naked, original and breaded) the sauce can all be ordered on the side.  I had ordered 22 but regardless of the 3 sizes available the prices are about a buck a wing which seems kind of like a lot but these days I suppose it's acceptable.  

The wings were good.  I mean for a pizza place their wings are probably better than the other pizza places that also have wings like Domino's or Caesars.  Years ago they used to be called \"Wing Street\" for some reason.  Today that's no longer the case but I think back in the day (the last time I had ordered them) they seemed better.  

The bottom line is I don't go to Pizza Hut often.  These days I mostly go to Domino's because it's closer and Caesar's is closer too.  Pizza Hut is ok and the deal is ok and really looking at the menu their every day prices are competitive too but I can't really say they're better than any of the other pizza places nearby, chain or not.

The food is decent but not better than average IMO.  Looking back I think it simply was better back in the day."}
{"text":"Yeah...no.

I ordered one lone pizza and it took nearly TWO HOURS for my delivery. As my stomach slowly consumed itself during the seemingly perpetual wait, I grew desperate and began to look out my window at the sound of any car, hoping it was the delivery guy. Finally, after what seemed like forever, he had arrived. I opened my door eagerly just as he approached the porch. He seemed taken aback and said, \"Whoa\" and looked at me like I was crazy. Yeah, I've already waited for two hours, I'm not going to pretend I don't see you and wait for you to knock then wait a few more seconds feigning making my way to the door. Ugh. 

Long story short, ordering from this location was regrettable and I'll never do it again."}
{"text":"This place does not honor the 50% off offer for ordering online. I was trying to order online but since I live in a new community (less than 1 mile from their restaurant) our address doesn't show up on their system. What a bad service...I'm sure there is a way to honor the 50%off on their register but Manager said they can't! Amazing how they'd rather loose business. SMH."}
{"text":"This will be my last Pizza Hut order in this life. If u order spinach on ur pizza they throw fresh spinach on too b4 they close the box. Also if h order  a 8 piece wing order for $7.00 u have to pay for dipping sauce really!!! Never again!!!"}
{"text":"I dont know why I let Pizza Hut trick me into ordering their pizza with their 'new crusts' their pizza still sucks as bad as it did when my parents used to force that crap down my throat years ago. Havent eaten it since then and dont know why I ever bothered to try them now they STILL SUCK and probably always will."}
{"text":"I placed an order online at 7:47 PM. this store literally called ME at 9:06 PM to \"see why the order was taking so long.\" of course I had no clue why because I'd not been an employee of theirs ever in my life. we get off the phone. my pizza was just delivered at 9:44 PM. the delivery man says, \"they told me to tell you it was just made fresh for you.\" this pizza is cold, the cheese isn't melted and there is a hair on it. where do I post pictures for proof? I was honestly very nice and very patient the entire time. I have no clue why this was done to me. they couldn't have known I was black so I don't believe it was racially motivated. and I know this review won't do much, if anything, at all. but i thought I'd at least let others know of the crap going on over there. Will never order from them again. it's unfortunate because I do love pizza hut. the delivery man was a sweet guy. I just don't understand how this happened or why it happened."}
{"text":"Not my place I would order from again. Wanted to some pizza and wings to eat while watching the Cardinals game. I ordered online and not the easiest thing to do from your phone with the App. Went to their location to pick up our pizza and wings. Took a while for them to find out order and our wings want done didn't take too long for them to make her wings got home in the pizza look like this."}
{"text":"Im very surprised with the low reviews and that is why I've finally decided to write a review. I've been coming to this Pizza Hut for years and I've had a great experience every single time. I haven't tried the lunch buffet its always for dinner. I love that you can sit down and enjoy a restaurant type atmosphere at a pizza place without the games and annoying singing characters. The staff has always been friendly and I've never seen it messy even on a busy night. The pizza is typical pizza hut pizza its tasty but obviously its not brick oven caliber. The salad bar is what keeps me and my family coming back. The salad always seems fresh with a variety of toppings and dressings you just can't beat it."}
{"text":"We ordered delivery for two pizzas and an asiago cheese bread. The pizzas were fine but the cheese bread was totally burnt. I can't believe they delivered it to us. This was 8pm on a Friday, so it should've been prime pizza time.

Would not order from again."}
{"text":"Pizza hut is not my favorite pizza spot but the pretzel crust pizza sounded like something worth trying so we ordered.  Shortly after ordering the manager called us to say they were out of mushrooms so we substituted tomatoes.  When the driver arrived she told us that they had enough mushroom for one pizza, but when they opened the bag to refill the shrooms they were not happy with the quality of them and did not feel comfortable serving them.  Pleasant driver and honesty are a plus.  Also they apparently care about the quality of the product.  Upon opening the pizzas there was no pretzel crust they were both asiago.  I called the manager and he offered to remake the pizza or a $5 credit.  We took the credit because we already had the pizzas.  The corporate office also emailed me and is sending coupons for 2 free large pizzas.  
The quality of pizza hut seems to have improved slightly.  The sauce still is not my favorite and the crust is greasy.  The honesty and sincerity of the employees I had talked to was good.  The customer service was very good.  I am going to give an overall rating of 3.  2 for the food and a 4 for the customer service."}

Took my business elsewhere after being a loyal customer since 2004! Rudeness will not get you my business ."}
{"text":"Let me preface this by saying I actually felt compelled to make a Yelp account just to prevent other people from suffering the inexplicable ineptitude of the particular staff I dealt with during my visit to this location. My regular store is on 19th Ave. & Indian; they have never done me wrong, and I will never again go astray. Let me also just say that I have worked in pizza (in a real, from-raw-materials pizza kitchen), so I am not fooled. I know how pizza works, and my standards are the product of that experience.

During the dinner service on Saturday, August 29th, I visited the 43rd Ave. & McDowell location with three friends. I placed the following order for dine-in, and paused between requests to allow the crew member to input my orders: \"I would like three large pizzas. The first will be the Giddy Up BBQ Chicken with a stuffed crust. The second will be the Pretzel Piggy on a pan pizza crust, but the order is for a vegetarian, so please make sure no bacon is added. She would also like to switch the standard Balsamic drizzle for a barbecue drizzle instead. The third will be the Garden Party, extra sauce and no cheese, please.\" The crew member read back my order, to the letter, and I went to our table to wait.

It goes promptly downhill from here.

First Incident: A server comes to the table with my friend's separate chicken wing order and drops her fork. She kindly offers to replace it, but when she does, she leaves the dropped fork in the middle of the dining floor. I'm sorry, why?

Second Incident: A second server come to the table to tell us two of the pizzas are ready to come out, but the third (my Garden Party) is being remade because cheese was added by mistake. Because I know that \"no cheese\" is a curveball request, this doesn't bother me too much, but now they have to trash a whole pizza, and that sucks.

Third Incident: My pizza arrives and, to my severe disappointment, I realize it is completely wrong. I hate being the complainer, but it's wrong enough that I need to address it. I approach the counter and explain to the same crew member who took my order that my pizza is incorrect. She says, \"Yeah, you ordered the Garden, it has no meat.\" Perplexed by this response because it is wrong on so many levels, I say, \"I realize what a Garden pizza is. I ordered the Garden Party, extra sauce, no cheese.\" To be clear, the Garden Party is defined as a Garden (Veggie) pizza to which three things have been added: a crust flavor edge, fresh spinach, and a Balsamic drizzle, all of which are what makes this a $15.49 item. I go on to say, \"The pizza on my table lacks the crust edge I paid for, the spinach I paid for, and the drizzle I paid for. Thus, it is not correct.\" The crew member seems confused by my complaint and says, \"Do you want us to add the stuff to it?\" As calmly as I can through my annoyance because, no, you can't just add a new crust edge, I say, \"Yeah, I suppose you can.\"

Not a moment later, I realize this process is not worth it, and I flag down the manager to request a refund. The manager, Daniel, was very polite and showed the appropriate level of remorse while making sense of my issues and processing my $17 refund, for which I was grateful. He also offered me a store credit, but because it would be specific to that location, I declined.

Fourth Incident: I return to my table and realize they've brought out my \"corrected\" pizza regardless, which I decide to consider a small victory at this point. One bite in, however, I find that they have managed -- once again! -- to drop the ball. The featured sauce drizzle for the Garden Party is the Balsamic. They used barbecue. I take a deep breath, process my First World Problems, and move on.

Fifth and Final Straw: As I eat my pizza with no more enjoyment left to spare for the meal, I am tasked with experiencing one final aneurysm. Now, when I placed the order for our table, I specifically requested two separate pizzas that have no meat on them. I even specified that one of us is vegetarian (I felt no need to mention it, as my pizza was inherently vegetarian, but I also do not eat meat), so I thought it would be logical to assume that the staff would take extra care to ensure no meat made it onto the pizzas by mistake. Apparently this was far too lofty an expectation, because I plucked a chunk of bacon fat the size of a dime off of one of my slices.

At this point, so baffled I was nearly crippled by the sort of laughter one only experiences when sanity dies, I resolved never to return to this circle of Hades cleverly disguised as a Pizza Hut.

Now, the carryout/delivery only location on 19th Ave. & Indian? You still have my heart."}
{"text":"Very poor customer service experience.  I ordered & picked up 2 pizzas.  When I got home I opened the boxes & saw that I had been given the wrong order.  I called and was told that my pizzas would be remade.  I brought back the wrong pizzas & tried to pick up my correct order.  They tried to give my my original pizzas that were old, dried and burnt.  The manager agreed that they were old.  Who does that?  I understand things happen but they didn't even try to redeem themselves.  I asked for my money back.  This was the 2nd try with this location.  First experience they charged my card twice.  Never again."}
{"text":"As Pizza Huts go, I was pretty impressed with this location. No, I haven't lost my mind.  

I was looking for a salad bar buffet, but found something better, Wing Street. Wing Street offers Buffalo Wild Wings type, quality boneless and regular chicken wings. Pizza Hut has been rolling it out nationally. 

They're very good, and incredibly large (see photos). Plus my Scottish heritage just loves their price of just $0.60 each on Wednesdays. Nice!

When I mentioned this was my first time at this location, the Manger here went out of her way to update me on all their specials and handed me a discount flier. Nice effort!

Besides the $0.60 Wednesdays for the chicken wings, there's also a 35% off Pasta Tuesdays.

I know what UR thinking, would Georgie actually buy and eat pasta from Pizza Hut?  Well no, not really, but was a nice gesture which I appreciated. 

The reason I'm writing this review is due to their outstanding Bone-Out Chicken, which is very reasonably price and worth the trip. Really!

Btw, there's no salad bar here. So much for good intentions. LOL

So Three Stars, \"A-Okay\"!"}
{"text":"The manage for one year is a very rude! I felt like I was one of his mma opponent. I could tell he is because of his cauliflower ears. His customer service as a manager needs improving. He makes the situation worst because of the tone and attitude! The manager of the summerlin sides needs to train customer service. I will not waste my time with this Pizza Hut."}
{"text":"I was really feeling pizza hut today & i love pizza huts usual hot fresh cheesy amazing tasting pizzas.. 
So i decided to get delivery from the only location close to me.. 
They told me 45 mins bcuz the weather 'really bad' . The weather was fine. No snow on the ground either.. 

1st off, I live in a building so at 45 mins i went downstairs expecting him to get there by then considering deliveries usually come WITHIN 45 mins, & i didnt want the guy to be waiting for me for too long.  
I wait for 25 minutes downstaires, i call them , the guy goes 'sorry, the guys already on his way he should be 10 minutes. The weathers REALLY BAD. The roads are bad' 
.. Im like i live 5 minutes away from u. 
Hes like ok sorry sorry. Sorry. 
The guy comes 'sorry mam sorry, it suddenly got really busy.' Im like its ok i jus came down 25 mins ago so u didnt have to wait. 
So was the weather bad or it was busy? 
Im a human being, so i tipped him well, we all know the struggle. 

ASIDE FROM ALLA THIS. 
I was then ready to go attack this fresh cheesy goodness.
My stuffed crust pizza was a hard, gross pizza which seemed like they stuck REFRIGERATED solid cheese sticks in the pizza . 

Killed my entire view on pizza hut. 
The stars for my boneless bites :)

Never ordering from here again."}
{"text":"Horrible experience, I called and placed the order at 7:43, I called Pizza Hut at 8:51 to check the status of the order and was told that the driver didn't have the room number to deliver the ordered pizza. I was also told that the driver called with no missed call or voicemail on my cell phone. I am staying at a hotel for business and if the delivery driver arrived at the hotel with no room number listed and couldn't contact me a simple conversation with the front desk would have cleared up any confusion about my room number. I was then told that because the driver couldn't deliver the pizza to me the manager on duty canceled the order. There was never a call placed to me to let me know that my pizza was here for delivery nor did the manger call to inquire about my delivery. I will NEVER order from this or any other pizza hut again. How difficult is it to provide customer service."}
{"text":"Food is tasty, but every time something is omiss. Either dip missing or pizza is left unsliced. Owners seem quite nice though and since my complaints are trivial I have never brought my issues to them. Enjoy your meal!"}
{"text":"Avoid like the plague!  I called on Saturday night and asked how long it would be until my pizza would be ready, before I placed the order.  I was told it would be 15 minutes.  As I concluded the call, the employee said it would be 30 minutes.  Strange that it would double in the two minutes it took me to place my order, but I live very close by, so no big deal.  I arrived right at 30 minutes.  It ended up being over an HOUR, from the time I placed my call, to the time I got my pizza.  I get that it was busy, but they should train their people to be able to provide semi-accurate estimates so customers don't have to wait around and waste their time.  Also, when I placed my order, I had asked if I could leverage a specific promotion that I had seen online, and I was told that it was available online only.  While I was waiting for my pizza,  a man came in and provided that same code, which they honored. (!)   I could have saved 50% off the price of my food.  After all that, I did not get a single apology or any sort of empathy.  At least I would think they would offer a simple \"I'm sorry for your wait.\"  To top it all off, the pizza was terrible (according to three starving teenagers, who for the record eat just about everything!).   My kids love Pizza Hut but this experience was very disappointing, and I will never frequent this location again."}
{"text":"I placed a large pizza order for 2pm. Tried to pay for it ahead of time & wasn't allowed..."}
{"text":"I hate how I place a order online and I come into the store and my order is wrong always never fails the manager doesn't even care he brought out my pizza and half of the pizza was burnt the other have wasn't cooked all the way I don't understand do they not read their online orders or what?? So annoying that I have to stand her for another 20 mins until my food is done!!!"}
{"text":"The 2ft pizza was pretty good but what got this Pizza Hut a two star rating was the fact that my pizza was not delivered hot when I was in the neighbor next to the pizza hut. If I'm less then a mile away from the Pizza hut, I expect my pizza warm."}
{"text":"Third time just literally a few minutes ago 8:42 PM January 6, 2017 got my pizza it was cold it also took over an hour to get here. Never order from this Pizza Hut if you want to hot good pizza delivered in a timely fashion"}
{"text":"Simply the worst pizza I have ever had in life time. Oily( like drowning in cheapp veg oil) thick fat uncooked crust, which was sagy and did not have much toppings. Delivery was late 1 hour though estimated delivery was 90 minutes initially. How do people eat this????"}
{"text":"I ordered carry out and mentioned will pick pizza at 8.15 pm


I reached there sharp 8.15pm and they told me my pizza will be Available in 10 mins. They actually started making pizza after seeing me in the store (supposed to be ready at that time)


I waited 20 mins and thought of typing this in the free time."}
{"text":"My family orders from here every other week at least. There's only been one problem in 3 years+ ( 1/2 jalapeños wasn't in the pizza). Delivery times are always within 20 minutes, I live 5 minutes away. Pizza is always hot, wings always fresh. The $20 dinner box value cannot be beat by anyone's delivery. 
I'd give 5 stars but hey, it's not the best pizza I've ever had."}
{"text":"When I came in it was full. But the staff are nice! And they are working hard to please guest. I took a lot of pictures but the staff didn't seem to mind. The place is very very clean. The staff are very respectful and its a nice lil family spot. I'm not into their wings but upon today they were very good. Pizza Hut is famous for greasy pizza but someone is doing something right at this location because the food was perfect. I'm hard to please but this location went above the bar and I will return ASAP. I even sent the husband a text message show case N the pizza. Enjoy the pictures and go visit them soon! I hope it is as good for you as it was for me. People this is a location where they don't offer waiter service but they did on this day. Its so nice to see people cater to you when they don't have to.  And they did it with a smile :) The food was not over cooked was not under cooked....OMG PIZZA-HUT GOT A CLUE AND HIRED A REAL CHEF I BELIEVE."}
{"text":"Order 2 medium pizzas and a chocolate chip brownie for carry out. When I got there to pick up the pizza the gentleman was outside and started to help me as soon as I exited my vehicle. He was very helpful and extremely friendly. He found my order quickly and provided plates, napkins, and packs of crushed red pepper and Parmesan. I was pleased with the service.  When I was getting in my vehicle the same gentleman was helping a lady and her small child to her car with their order. That is great service."}
{"text":"Pizza Hut is one of my favorite places to grab some pizza. We decided to order a medium three topping pizza. We were able to split the toppings on half of the pizza, so technically in total we got 6 toppings. The pizza was delicious we were able to mix the chili flakes into the sauce to make it spicy. 

We didn't have to wait too long to get the order, approximately 10 mins. The serve was quick and the order was just the way we wanted. Well most definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"Today we ordered from Pizza Hut as we have a thousand times in the past. It seemed like a different pizza company altogether. The crust was totally unlike the usual.  it felt like I was literally eating cardboard. So dry. Switching to premade? Switching vendors? Not liking it."}
{"text":"Ordered online. Computer says it will be ready in 20-30 minutes.. I arrive to pick it up at the 30 minute mark and I have to wait an additional 15-20 minutes. Idk if it's the establishments fault or the computer but 50 minutes is pretty ridiculous even for Sunday night football.



Update: not only that but we ordered and paid for extra for cheesy bread and we were given regular garlic bread that was cold."}
{"text":"This place is like a typical pizza hut place like the one found back in India. They offer average pizzas with a little expensive price. I tasted only the vegetarian pizza so my review wouldn't be a complete one."}
{"text":"Wife and I went to have lunch and try their pizza buffet that they recently reintroduced. While the pizza was pretty good and on-par with their normal pizza menu offerings, we were still disappointed. They do not have salad now (which they used to have) and their pasta is very similar to their pasta offerings EXCEPT that their is no meat or chicken in the pasta offerings. If their was any meat or chicken, it was in such small quantities that you could not see it or tell. They do have a small side salad for additional cost, but that too is very, very small. While their pizza is normal, the rest of the buffet is substandard. For the price, CiCi's is better, even if the pizza is of lesser quality."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I used to order from this location at least once a week until today's experience. We definitely will not be coming back here again. 
The pizza we ordered was completely undercooked, so undercooked that the staff asked if we ordered stuffed crust. Instead of the manager asking to remake it, she was trying to justify the fact that it was soggy by saying it was because of the extra sauce. After the manager left to the back for who knows what, we specifically told the cashier that we did not want another pizza just wanted our money back. Apparently there was no communication there because the manager remade our pizza and said the cashier did not mention we wanted our money back. In the 30 minutes that we were there they managed to mess up 3 more orders. The whole situation was handled very unprofessionally and the manager refused to give us her name. She actually ended up giving us our money back and walked away with a free pizza but only after my boyfriend mentioned he was going to contact the owner.
Worst customer service ever!"}
{"text":"Extremely bad! The worst ever! Please go somewhere else cause their food is always cold and they always give the wrong items, then say they don't do refunds."}
{"text":"Tiny location. Pick up and delivery only. Clean and friendly. Pizza here is always worth the money"}
{"text":"I got food poisoning from here when I ate the chicken wings, it was terrible! The only time I eat it is when my boyfriends mom orders pizza . Their butter garlic crust is pretty awesome."}
{"text":"This review is only for the lunch \"buffet\". We have tried it a few times just in case we hit a bad day. Nope. Same situation each time. Basically they have a few slices of pepperoni, a few cheese, and maybe a few 
Hawaiian or sausage, but they are all rock hard and stale. They don't keep it stocked at all worth other items either. There were no breadsticks the whole time we are there, and I'm guessing they didn't feel like putting them in.  I probably would only eat the buffet if it was a dollar... But since it is actually expensive compared to what you get.... I'll just"}
{"text":"This is a great Pizza Hut location. The pizza comes out on time, it looks and tastes great every time, and they're super friendly in there.

They even gracefully handled an issue with my order that was entirely my fault. No extra charge to fix it, no bad attitude, just good service.

I've been to some *really* terrible pizza places, including Pizza Hut locations, that will never get my business again. I'll be coming back to this one for sure though.

Of course, I'll update my review if this proves to be inconsistent."}
{"text":"This by far has been my worst experience with Pizza Hut. Never visited this location and I highly doubt I will come back. Poor customer service. Pizzas where not made as ordered. I ordered extra pineapple and ham on one and extra pepperoni on the other! This is what I got pizza with no cheese on some slices even no pepperoni. Very upsetting ! Pictures speak for themselves."}
{"text":"My coworkers and I order pizza here often.  We had delivery a few times and they're pretty quick.  Today we decided to carryout.   We ordered 2 classic pzone pizzas and 2 garlic butter dipping sauce for only $11.87.  It was ready within 20 minutes.  Upon arrival, I got confused as to which door to enter so I opened the delivery only door and immediately shut it and went to the door to the left.  That was the right door!  There were no signs telling me where the entrance was, so beware and read the signs.

Overall, pzone was delicious!"}
{"text":"We generally get our pizza from here, BUT on more than on occasion they've been \"out of crust,\" which left us out of luck.  Not only was that the case more than once, but they seemed completely unconcerned by the admission and did nothing to make up for it on future visits."}
{"text":"Food was cold when it got here....also took over an hour to her here and to top it all off...my order was wrong too....wasn't to happy about it. However, the manager did give me a credit on my messed up.order"}
{"text":"Is it possible to rate a zero?  I will try...

We came here tonight because the kids wanted some pizza...  The hostess (a middle-aged blonde -haired woman with a lot of miles on her face) looked at us, and immediately looked away.  She then commented to the kitchen worker, \"I don't believe this crap!  I just cleaned out the buffet!\"  She refused to wait on is and continued complaining, \"Don't these people have homes!?\"  

Umm, yes, we have homes, but enjoy a meal out from time to time...  What a terribly managed restaurant this must be to allow a waste of oxygen like her to have a job...

We walked out and went to Red Robin where the experience was 180 degrees in the opposite direction!"}
{"text":"Called in an order for carry out. Bobby was super polite and helpful even with my picky order. I arrived 10mins later and the order was almost done already only had to wait a couple mins. Plus they got the order right which most places screw up. Super happy that this is the location near my new place."}
{"text":"I like pizza hut from time to time this one is only a couple miles from my house and a quit late night stop. I really like this store the ppl that work here are great. The drivers are really friendly I've spoke to them a couple times as well. Managers are always friendly as well."}
{"text":"This place sucks! The delivery is so slow, and when you call to find out the ETA you get the run around! Then the jerk manger Scott gives you attitude because your upset that your pizza's are late. I'm sorry but 55 min is not acceptable especially when you were told it's going to be 30 min max 45. Best part is my pizza were room temp not hot. Never again"}
{"text":"Well its hot & fresh. I like it thin with mushrooms olives onions & sausage. The wings are cool as well. Long as they are Bbq. I enjoy this location most because they are close to home."}
{"text":"I am a first-time customer. I ordered regular french fries and had them delivered along with some wings and a pizza.There was no ketchup for the fries. I called the store and was told they do not carry ketchup (Seriously?). I asked them to take the french fries off of my order since I don't eat fries without ketchup, didn't have any myself and they don't serve catchup.

They refused and hung up on me.

Never again. Scum bag on the phone and I will be contesting this credit card charge.

Update: I had the charge taking off my credit card, but only the amount for the fries and the tip. As far as the so-called \"manager\" hanging up on me? His manager has been notified, as well as the parent company. If I could give negative stars I would. Despicable behavior.

As for the food; mediocre. Just about what you'd expect."}
{"text":"We are staying at the Westgate resort and had walked by this small Pizza Hut a few times on the way to the elevator. It's just inside the north tower doors on the 1st floor. There is ample seating available if you want to eat there. So, Westgate does a \"Go green\" deal where you get $10 towards any restaurant/food place in the resort if you forego housekeeping services that day (you get the coupon the next day). We got that coupon which made for a sweet, cheap deal at Pizza Hut. We ordered the chicken Alfredo pasta, meat marinara pasta and 3 breadsticks. Holy cow, they get a star just for the breadsticks. I might have to go back for those. Our total with the $10 coupon applied was only $7 something! We weren't able to finish it all with 2 adults eating and a toddler. 

The service was fairly quick and the employees were friendly. They have personal size pizzas. Not sure if they do bigger ones."}
{"text":"Methinks not is right.
LONG story short...
Pizza was 1 hour late. Area Supervisor was not willing to do a dang thing about it except say, \"I'm sorry.\" I asked for our pizza and a refund and he said he'd give me a refund but he was also going to take my pizza back. I don't think so.
Bottom line is we got our pizza and a refund. A cold pizza. We lost our lunch hour waiting for this cold pizza.
Please do avoid this store. At least until they have better management..."}
{"text":"Order 30 mins late. The phone line doesn't work. I'm wondering if it's coming or if I should make a quick meal for my very cranky and hungry toddlers. This is a total nightmare."}
{"text":"Great small Pizza Hut! Nice staff and very efficient.

I like that there system remembers your previous orders so it makes ordering very quick. 

The one item that is memorable is that I ordered online once and under special instructions I asked them I wish my son a happy birthday and they really did it! My son was so happy they drew a cake and all on the box!"}
{"text":"Clean, not too busy. The waitress, older Caucasian lady, seemed to be manager with the way she carried herself was a bit weird. She just stood there and leaned against the counter and watched us eat. Made me extremely uncomfortable. I don't know maybe she just wanted to be on top of things but I thought it was odd. I just wanted to get out of there. She was a decent waitress but not necessarily welcoming."}
{"text":"If I could give a negative 5 stars I would. The sauce on the pizza was sour like it was spoiled and when I called to express my concerns about it. All I was told was well it was a new bag of sauce and we haven't had complaints from anyone else tonight. The sauce was so bad we couldn't even eat a whole slice of pizza. Never ordered food from here. The people that answered the phone have no customer service skills at all. Worst pizza I've ever had in my life just disgusting. Again I say don't order from here. You will be throwing money away."}
{"text":"Well, after earlier giving this place a 5-star review, tonight's experience was the exact opposite. When their online system bizarrely lost my order for the first time ever, I wasn't upset and didn't complain. Before I could even respond the woman at the counter seemed quite irritated at me, and rather accusingly said I either choose the wrong store (nope) or didn't hit the checkout button (also confirmed to be incorrect.)  No offer to take my order, and zero effort to double-check whether it had come in and was overlooked. All she was interested in was being rude.  

I turned and left without a word.  They don't get many glowing reviews here obviously, and clearly they can't hold on to the ones they do get."}
{"text":"Food is terrible and has been delivered cold to me the last two times I have ordered. The last order took 1 hour and 45 to get delivered, even though the email promised it within an hour. I will never order from here again!!"}
{"text":"Ordered their wingstreet bone in lemon pepper wings and I was very surprised at how good it was. Very comparable to wing stop and other chicken wing places. Would highly recommend."}
{"text":"Great service! Austin is a Rockstar. He took care of my order. I called as I was driving to pick it up. It was ready about 5 minutes after I got there. It was perfect just like I ordered!! Thx"}
{"text":"This is the best Pizza Hut we have near our home, they don't deliver so I always have to come pick up. It's usually delicious and I don't have any issues however, I did have an issue with them about 2 months ago that I forgot to yelp about when they told me they were out of a certain dough so they said they had to charge me extra for stuffed crust because that was all they had. Smh. I didn't ask for that so why charge me more!
Fast forward to today, I'm sitting here while they remake my pizza because I came to pick up and they one they were attempting to give me was burnt all around the crust and the cashier told me that's the cheese and the next one will look like that too. Ummmm, I've been eating pizza for 30 years I think I know what the crust is supposed to look like and it's not burnt.

I posted a picture of the new one.. it looks much better."}
{"text":"We decided to try this location since our closest location was grossly sub par. We ordered two thin crust large pizzas with three toppings, one large stuffed crust pizza with 3 topping, 24 wings, and a chocolate chip dessert cookie. EVERYTHING tasted great. Topping were accurate, stuffed crust was appropriate, cookie was moist and not hard. Only thing that prevented us from providing a perfect score was (1) double pineapple looked more like 1.5 pineapple and (2) we were not offered cheese and peppers. Other than that, our order was FANtastic and we WILL be returning."}
{"text":"Worst ever! Been ordering from other pizza huts forever this is the worst ever. I will no longer order from this or any other Pizza Hut ever! They keep hanging up on us after  we were trying  to relieve the problem of not getting  our pizza at all are you kidding???bad bad bad bad........"}
{"text":"This location won't take your order unless you do it online.  Staffer made me get on my smart phone to place my order since \"there was no way\" he could help me otherwise.  He did offer to assist me if I had a question though.  My son really wanted the stuffed crust pizza so I powered through the 20+ questions rather than being able to place my order with the worker behind the counter. Needless to say, I will not return...with numerous other pizza places that want my business, Pizza Hut Summerlin can kiss my a$$."}
{"text":"2 HOURS FOR COLD PIZZA! Called at 6:09 for 8 minutes and spoke with Steven. He verified my address was deliverable. At 7:39 I called again asking for my order. He spoke with his manager and confirmed the order was on its way. At around 8:00 I got into my car and drove to the location on Google that matched the phone number I called. No Pizza Hut there. So then I called the restaurant- again. While on hold, my fiance informed me the food had arrived. Cold. They must be very busy because they hung up on me after 10 minutes as I drove back home. 
Their address is listed as 18440 N 7th St., Phoenix and the number I called is 602.863.1224. I am absolutely livid that I spent over $30 on an order of cold, chewy pizza that took over two hours to arrive."}
{"text":"Delivered wrong wings.  No big deal, but employee was rude, never offered an apology,  and asked if I ate the wrong wings, with a nasty tone, adding...\"they will need those back\".
Of course, I didn't eat their wrong wings, as a matter of fact, Pizza Hut won't have to worry about me eating their wings or pizza ever again.  Lost a customer of  decades."}
{"text":"This Pizza Hut kiosk just open this past week and already my office is their main delivery order. Well I guess they needed to find another place besides JJs. 

The secret of course is that they deliver, just like JJs. What's interesting though is that they're willing to offer the same weekly specials that the sit-down Pizza Hut offers over on Arizona Avenue does: Tuesday's is Pasta, Wednesday is bone out Chicken and Thursday's are Wings. Nice! Though I don't believe I'll ever be brave enough to try their pasta. LOL

I came here on Friday assuming that had a small sit down area. They do, minus any tables. I had the eight piece Boneless Chicken for $7 and a Meat Lover individual pan pizza Combo for $6.00. It wasn't bad, in fact it was pretty good and hit the spot.

Three Stars, A-Okay."}
{"text":"We use you guys for our delivery service in our hotel non stop and we keep getting complaints. Last two times I've ordered it has taken 1.5 hours to be delivered and tonight was no exception. Pizza is cold and tastes old and is not ok! Just look at the photo and you can see the sauce all dried out"}
{"text":"The pizza is better than I expected and the specials are very good. You get a good pizza and a very good price. On the weekends to get a little backed up and you might have to wait an extra 15 to 20 minutes."}
{"text":"Kathy (our regular server) makes this local Pizza Hut the best!  We often eat here after church on Sundays. The buffet is always fresh and delicious, and Kathy makes our experience perfect every time."}
{"text":"The pizza here is very bland. Ordered the 10 dollar box and it took about 25 minutes for it to arrive at my house then got the box inside and saw there was no dipping sauces for my bread sticks or my cinnamon stick which is almost pointless to have order them."}
{"text":"I normally do not write reviews, but holy crap! It took almost 2 hours for 2 pizzas and a couple of sides to be delivered. Estimated time was 55 to 63 minutes per their email. The Pizza Hut location is literally right up the street, less than 1.5 miles. 2 hours....it seems to be a trend at this location, either f'ing up the order or taking an excessive amount of time to deliver. Honestly, I do not understand why we keep ordering from this place. I guess we will try the carryout method next time and if this is a fail too, then Papa John's it is. The one star is only because they actually got the order right, otherwise I'd give them a zero. My recommendation to the store.. close your store for a day and retrain your employees and management to be more efficient. Something is broken in your system."}
{"text":"My family and I used moved here and this is our local pizza hut. The first time we ordered and had it delivered, everything was awesome. The second time, our wing order was short a wing. The MOD told me that he didn't have \"math majors\" working there so we're sorry. OMG, really? You need \"Math Majors\" to count to 16? This third time our pizza was 45 min late (quoted 30 min, but it took 75), both pizzas were luke warm as a result, no seasoning in the sauce or the dough, and we didn't get our stuffed crust. Paul, the MOD, apologized as said to ask for him to ensure it is made right next time since he has a lot of new people there and training has been challenging. Umm, NO. We wont be returning. I will drive a little further to another location."}
{"text":"Ok, nothing exceptional. Order was ready on time. Food was just ok."}
{"text":"First time coming to this location and the pizza was horrible. Usually when I ask for hand toss the ENTIRE pizza is nice and fluffy this time it was flat and only my crust was fluffy. Plus the garlic on the crust is not my fav. Second, what location doesn't have plates to dine-in so we had to eat our pizza on a to-go box  oh and no water cups? wow smh."}
{"text":"Don't waste your time ordering here!!! We placed an order online and it was delivered 30 minutes later than the quoted time. My husband called the store and they said they couldn't hear him because of static and hung up. Yet, he called via WiFi so how couldn't you hear him?!? I called back to the same rude person who said the pizza left and gave no reason for the delay of over 20 minutes. If you are hungry use Uber eats, grub hub, or another pizza place."}
{"text":"i ordered online from here for delivery. i wound ordering the 2 sets of wings and 2 waffle fries meal deal thingy and 2 sets of chocolate dunkers (sooooo yum!).. i really thought u just can't beat that particular deal, esp compared to dominos lol.. however, i think what i ended up w/ was just 1 waffle fries ;/// (it came in just 1 box, if it was 2 sets in 1 box, then ok, but otherwise, i think i got stiffed) .. while the wings didn't taste horrible, they were definitely just avg and barely decent honestly. the waffle fries kinda lacked flavor and gave me dry mouth even w/ the ketchup lol... i think if i order from pizza hut again, i'm gonna try for the pasta instead and get a bunch of chocolate dunkers (i'm a chocoholic).. but idk, is the pasta even any good here? lol.. maybe at a diff pizza hut?"}
{"text":"I order from the app and the pizza is always on time and never a problem. Very consistent and they put like a garlic salt on the crust....oh, its so good!"}
{"text":"The wings were crispy and the sauce was perfect! The pizza we got was great too! Good job Pizza Hut"}
{"text":"I ordered from here last night online. I had ordered 

-Large Pizza
-8 Bone-in Wings
-Cinnamon Sticks

The pizza was good, but greasy also. The bone-in wings did not look very appetizing, because they weren't even fully covered with sauce. We always have a problem with the wings, because of the size. I won't be ordering from here again. Papa Johns is about the same distance, and they have better food."}
{"text":"Constantly figuring out ways to disappoint.
Food quality has gone through the floor also, not very customer oriented i've noticed many times if you order within an hour of them closing they will call with an excuse to not bring your food. Random excuses. You have done it to me many times change the delivery times dont lie to us, were just hungry !!!!"}
{"text":"Terrible!! Nasty!! 3 times in a row we had late  delivery and wrong order! Shouldn't even give 1 stars."}
{"text":"So I've never felt compelled until now to Yelp a complaint. This location has the worst service I've ever experienced. I phoned in an order ($50+) for delivery and was told originally 45 minutes, then quickly retold \"we'll be there in 30\". Cool. Well I get busy and notice 90 minutes later, still no pizza! I call to see what the status is, and I was told that my order didn't exist. I literally called it in so there wouldn't be an online snafu. I was told that I must be lying because it was only her (a manager supposedly) and another \"manager\" working at the time i called. I told her I spoke to a man on my order placement so Timmy is full of crap, if it's only you two working at that time. I have the time stamp and length of call to your location, genius! She continued to stress that I was wrong/lying and said \"are you like just looking for something or start a problem?\" Are you f'in serious? A note to the owner of this franchise, if Timmy and the female \"manager\" working 12/23/15 3:56 PM to 5:30 PM for your location are responsible for your business, I would be wary. You just lost a repeat customer because of them. If they would've said \"we made a mistake and lost your order\", I could've worked with that. But to call me a liar? Done."}
{"text":"So dissappointed when i tried to substitute a garlic bread with cheese instead of bread sticks on the combo in restaurant, two items of equal value on the menu, and was just given an outright no. no reason offered, even when i brought up that they were the same price.

Also, ordered extra cheese, didn't get it. And checked the bill, and the waitress didn't put it in right.

Food was as expected, so so pizza, Yada Yada Yada."}
{"text":"If I could give them zero stars I would. We waited for over two hours for our pizza to be delivered and called twice only to receive inaccurate updates. I do not know how they are staying in business. That was our first and last order at Pizza Hut."}
{"text":"I would not order from this location again. The pizza delivered was not what I ordered. \"We ran out of your ordered size.\" So I got a different size with the right toppings, but wrong crust and it was cold. It seems more like they didn't want to make another, because the \"wings\" were a joke. A greasy pool of TINY chicken nuggets. Not at all what I ordered. Don't waste your money unless you can pick it up and verify you are getting what you paid for."}
{"text":"We ate pizza hut last night. Placed an order for pickup. Now my husband and I are sick at home vomiting and diarrhea  pretty sure we got food poisoning. Don't get this sick often. Not trashing Pizza Hut and Not saying you will too but just wanted to let you know. Any food service/restaurant we go to we are taking that chance of getting sick. Just so happen we were the lucky ones last night."}
{"text":"This is a review for the dining in experience. We usually go as a group and order 2 extra large pizzas (one from the meat selection and one from the chicken selection) as you will get a discount on your second pizza. I like pan pizza over everything else. Thin crust is OK. But stuffed crust and hand tossed are terrible."}
{"text":"Just your basic pizza delivery. The pasta is good. It's a solid place but occasionally they have mishaps with delivery. But overall, a solid pizza place."}
{"text":"This Pizza Hut is the worst! I placed an online order and when I arrived they told me the breadsticks were barely going in the oven. When I finally got the order the pizza was cold and the chicken wings were the wrong ones and even the count was off, what a joke! 
I did call to talk to their Store Manager to complain and was quite shocked with the level of customer service with this person, didn't catch her name, but she was rude when she pulled up my order information. Time to find another pizza place, how unfortunate!"}
{"text":"On July 8th we ordered a large pan pizza with bar-b-q wings, we frequently order from this location and we normally get great service and fast delivery. 

But this time, the pizza crust was RAW! It tasted like it needed a few more minutes and it would have been decent.  

I called back and spoke to the manager on duty whose name is Kyle, explained the pizza dough was still raw and he asked if I would like a replacement pizza or a refund, the replacement would take between 30 - 40 minutes, I'm said we will take a refund and thanked him. 

Well it's been 10 days and still no refund, I called back and got the manager on duty who copped an attitude and said they don't refund money but will put a credit on my account, I said that was not explained to me when I spoke to Kyle. She was extremely rude and said well if you don't like that you could speak to the owner or the district manager, I said ok what's his name? She says Eddie, I say what's his last name? She slams the phone down and yells to the other employees, what's Eddies last name? And then comes back to the phone and gives it to me. I say can you spell that for me? Then she goes on to say why am I upset over pizza?? I said cause that's not what I was told!  I wrote an email and also called the corporate office, hopefully they will speak to this rude woman, your salary depends on it!!!!"}
{"text":"One of the worst customer service experiences ever. I called to check the status of my delivery order since it was getting over the hour mark to find my order was lost and the attitude of the person on the phone for their mistake was atrocious. Tried speaking to the manager and was left one hold for 5 minutes and just gave up. Contacted customer service."}
{"text":"Horrible horrible! Driver is super rude u would think since ur a paying customer they'd treat u somewhat reasonable. No! if you have change he might have to count it's not worth it to him (he literally said that). I was a 2x a week customer! Not anymore I'd rather starve lol.... Nvr again! Plz give that job to somebody that needs it!"}
{"text":"If I could give this place a zero I would!!! Online order said it will take 30 to 40 minutes. Called at the 50 minute mark and they said oh the driver left with two orders, he delivered one already and he's on his way. They said call in to minutes if he doesn't get there. I called at the hour mark now!!!! And keep getting the same story. So if u have to deliver only 2 orders and one of those is ours, WTF is taking so long. I will NEVER ORDER FROM THIS PLACE AGAIN!!!! Hence, I'm here at the hour and 10 minute mark waiting. Do yourself a favor and get uber eats, dominos, or anything else!!!!"}
{"text":"Yeh when you think pizza hut. You think good pizza but i was wrong. It looked cooked... well the topping were cooked burn a bit but the dough was under cooked a bit doughy. How do manage to over cook the top and under cook the dough.


I also had meal box with cinnanon stick add with cheese... yeh not a good combo. Only redeeming thing was the boneless bites the sause was good. Jisy need morr and chicken was cooked fine.

The fact it was delivered in 20 minutes and the bite were decent. Why it doesnt get a one star. But i probably stick to pizza pizza right across the street."}
{"text":"I wish there was an option of a big zero.
Very rude staff, no proper phone etiquette !

Couldn't believe it was Pizza Hut"}
{"text":"Really understaffed! Waited for our server too long. Didn't have utensils, pop was flat, my cup was leaking, tables weren't clean. Was uncomfortably hot inside! Bathrooms were OK. Waited about five mins before anyone came to greet us in the front. On the good note....pizza was good."}
{"text":"OK, so we ordered pizza for delivery and we made a mistake on our address, we just moved and have an incorrect apartment number.  After we realized our mistake we called pizza hut only to find out the driver had attempted to deliver the pizza but could not due to our mistake.  After calling the store and correcting our error we waited for our new pie to arrive. We waited, and waited and waited.  After more than an hour our pie was delivered and it was... Horrible!  I am confident that it was the same pie they attempted to deliver more than 2 hours ago.  Called the store and spoke with the manager who was less than friendly and was assured that a driver would be by, sometime tonight, to pick up the pie and give us a refund.  We shall see...."}
{"text":"If it was possible to give minus one star I would give it 2 stars. Worst possible customer service experience in the history of customer service. We ordered wings as appetizer and the waitress came and left the wings on table. No plates, No forks or knives, no napkins no water. I called her to ask if we can get plates, she said oh sorry and brought us plates still no utensils. She didn't give ranch dipping sauce with wings for celery and carrots had to call her again for that. We ordered stuffed crust and she forgot about that. She charged us for stuffed crust even though a huge sign in front of store said \"try stuffed crust free\" . Then she brought someone else's salad and left at our table! We told her we didn't order salad. My daughter counted all the mistakes 11 altogether!!! We didn't get forks and knives till the end and we are pizza with hands and just left never to go back again!"}
{"text":"this is crazy this store called me back to tell me to go to dominos for my pizza... WOW they said they will not delivery on main street after dark, what the hell are hiring little children or something??? people it doesn't  matter where you delivery the world can be dangerous anywhere, this is a business near heavily populated businesses even at night, what a shame to lay such prejudice policies on a street and losing  me as a customer, beside that the last pizza you sent me sucked, it was undercooked and the meat was chewy. I would pick up a slice and it was like a wet noodle. I do not recommend this place to anyone they might thing you home is in to spooky of a place to delivery to. not to mention the extremely doughy crust..... beware now, if you walk outside into the heat you may exploded into a loaf of bread"}
{"text":"I called ahead and ordered a large pepperoni pizza.  If I picked it up, it would be ready in 15 mins.  If I needed delivery it would be an hour.  I picked it up.

The store is on the SE corner of the intersection and part of a stripmall facing Indian School Road. It isn't necessarily easy to find unless you are looking for it.  The store was super cold, they have GREAT A/C.  I only had to wait a few minutes since it hadn't been quite 15 minutes yet.  The pizza was hot and delicious and the staff was friendly and more importantly, exact on their time frame of when my pizza would be ready.  Will be ordering there again soon.  Wish they had a dining room there so I could eat on the spot instead of driving it home first."}
{"text":"Most of the reviews for this location are terrible. I've tried to order from this location before but every time I call they would immediately tell me they had a 3 hour wait. I obviously chose not to order. However I called this time and there was no such disclaimer. So for the first time in 3 + years living over here I ordered pizza hut!! Oh Pizza Hut thin crust how I've missed you. The girl who took my order was a tad on the rude side. Nothing implicitly rude, just a general blah attitude, in a hurry up and order your wasting my time kind of way. Once I ordered she said to give them an hour to and hour and a half for delivery. I think it took a little under an hour and the driver was at my door. She was very nice and pleasant and the food was very hot, (as it should be since I don't live far from them). It was pizza hut as I remembered, except the marinara was a bit runny. So overall I will give them a shot again sometime. I don't even try to order from them usually since their online/app ordering doesn't work for me. It tells me that no stores deliver to my address even though I live a few blocks from pizza hut. They seriously need to update that situation. I am all about convenience and calling my order in just isn't as convenient as being able to order electronically. Yes i'm one of those people who would rather text than talk... sorry just who I am :)"}
{"text":"The best thing was the quick delivery.  Other than that, it was overpriced, limp, soggy, and pretty much flavorless.  I've ordered three separate times, and they were all losers.  No more."}
{"text":"If I could give it negative starts I would! Horrible customer service! Sometimes they dont even answer and it seems like they don't even want to talk to anyone! ?"}
{"text":"Having a Corporate Family Holiday Party???? Want it ruined!?!? Then you've come to the right place. 
Order was placed day before and told it would here by 11:45am the next day. 
At noon No pizza. Called and we were told it was on its way and would be another 10 minutes. ONE HOUR LATER!!!!!! Here comes the pizza. More than half the people had left because they had small children with them and they were hungry. 
What a horrible experience!!!!! They said they knocked $60 off the order which was almost $400. Oh, thank you for your kindness and lack of apology. 
NEVER AGAIN!"}
{"text":"Received our pizzas just fine but no marinara for the breadsticks. Asked the delivery guy if he had forgot it in his vehicle, he didn't but told us he would be back with it shortly. Waited over an hour and still nothing. Called them and asked what was going on and they gave attitude and said they were sending it and hung up. Very rude. Shouldn't have forgotten it in the first place but the rudeness was entirely unnecessary. Thank you to the guy that delivered it though, at least he was polite."}
{"text":"Pizza of crap!!! Called this restaurant while I was staying in the Marriott on business. Mind you I haven't ordered from Pizza Hut in years but decided due to a long business day, I would go ahead and order some pizza. 
Well when I called and placed the order through the reservation line, the lady told me it would be approximately 30 minutes. After 45 minutes I called the local restaurant the manager told me that the driver would be leaving shortly and said that the people in customer service did not know what they were talking about because his drivers were busy and they should have told me 45 minutes to hour. 
When the pizza arrived, not only did the Driver put the bag with the pizza in it on the ground while he had me sign the credit card document. Then of course to my surprise opening the box the pizza was completely cold. 
Mind you this pizza was not cheap... Full price thin pepperoni pizza for $25. 
When I called the manager and explain to him that this pizza was cold and he proceeded to tell me \"the pizza is not cold\", I explained to him I am here with the pizza and yes in fact it is very cold... Then the manager yet again  insulted me by telling me I did not know what I was talking about. So again,  I would not recommend this restaurant at ALL!!!!"}
{"text":"My partner and I love Pizza Hut and we feel they are still among the tops in chain pizza despite the less than stellar reputation they now have. That seen we've seen a lot of inconsistencies in food quality at various huts around Northeast Ohio and the one star reviews made us wary of this one - that said we had enough points for a free pizza and we tried it. 

The food quality is superb compared to a number of other area franchises. Properly portioned and perhaps more critically properly baked. This goes for the breadsticks as well. There was also none of the infamous delays, long waits or poor service other reviews note. The cashier was in fact very friendly and prompt at greeting me the second he saw me. 

Granted, we did order and go on a Monday which I do realize is a slower business day, but that being said, we're off to a good start."}
{"text":"Awful customer service. The pizza was horrible. Order was wrong. The pizza looked like the delivery driver flipped his car all the way to deliver. Don't even know what else to say..."}
{"text":"Wanted something quick for dinner his evening so we decided upon the new cheesybite pizza which come with marinara sauce to dip the cheesy crust bits. We ordered the pizza with ground beef and green peppers. 

Service was good and the pizza came out quick.

The pizza looked good when I picked it up.

Once I got it home and sat down to eat I saw the crust was pretty thin so the slice would flop around (just not use to thin crust pizza). The flavors were good and had plenty of toppings. The cheesy bites were very good and when dipped in the provided sauce even better. Not sure how the three leftover pieces will taste when reheated. But we will see.

I can't complain much as a pizza to go is always middle of the road. Could go either way ;)"}
{"text":"Sucks! 2 hrs for an order? Poor mgmt, poor service! Had people waiting for food and all i got was \"oh sorry we got swamped.\" And I  called them after an hr. Never order again. F U PH. Thanks for nothing."}
{"text":"If you are really in the mood for a cold and soggy pizza, boy do I have the place for you. The new Pizza Hut on Lake Pleasant Pkwy will surely deliver.  When I break my diet, spend hard earned money, and I am rewarded with really poor quality, it will kind of screw up your night. 

Funny, my memory of Pizza Hut pan pizza WAS buttery crunchy crust. 

Note to PH: Hot Pizza = good.  Fast pizza = good. Hot Fast Pizza = Really good!  Fast cold Pizza = SUCKS!

All that said, wings were very good and driver was very pleasant (although not prepared, no Parmesan or pepper flakes)."}
{"text":"I just called this Pizza Hut to simply ask to speak to Customer Service.  The employee man simply keeps asking me, \"What is this is regards to?\"  I don't like his attitude in asking me this.  He simply needs to just transfer me over to the Customer Service.  Or say \"I can give you their number.\"

My reason for asking for the Customer Service is I want a pizza that is near 2000 Eglinton W and when I called Pizza Pizza and told them I need meat items that are non pork, she politely asked me, \"Do you want me to transfer you over to Customer Service?\"  It was very hard for her to help me when I told her I wanted no chicken or steak.  Wanted a beef pepperoni or a beef salami, etc.  So she just transferred me to Customer Service.

And then I thought to call this Pizza Hut and ask to be transferred to Customer Service.  And the employee keeps asking me, \"What is this in regards to?\"  I simply don't need to give a reason and he simply doesn't need to speak to his customer like this, \"What is this in regards to?\"

I simply tell him, \"I need Customer Service.\"  And later I get tired of the employee asking me. \"What is this in regards to?\" I tell him, \"I was speaking to Pizza Pizza about non pork meats and they very politely handed me over to Customer Service. So I am simply asking you to do the same. Transfer me over to Customer Service, please.\"

And now the big time.  HE HANGS UP ON ME  AS FAST AS HE CAN WHEN I REVEAL MY REASON.  MEANING TO SAY THERE IS NOTHING WRONG.  I JUST WANT A CUSTOMER SERVICE.  SOMEONE WHO HAS THE TIME TO GO OVER THE OTHER MEAT ITEMS WITH ME.  (This was at 12:55 pm on Wed Dec 20, 2017)."}
{"text":"I'm not sure if it's because the management has changed at this location or if I just have good luck, but my order was perfect.  I ordered online for delivery, and I received an email shortly after confirming the details of the pizzas as well as a delivery time.  I was honestly doubting my choice with ordering from this store due to so many negative reviews, but I hope mine will change someone's mind.  I received both pizzas in 25 minutes, and they were hot.  Hut estimated 30 minutes.  Tasted the way they looked, which is a bonus."}
{"text":"Estimated delivery time 45 minutes actually delivery time 120 minutes.

Pizza Hut , a pizza of last resort."}
{"text":"So it was New Year's Eve and we were going to finish our binge watching of The Crown - Season Two, with only three episodes left. 

Now what to munch on, while watching Princess Margaret, Prince Philip, PM Harold MacMillian give agita to her Majesty the Queen?  As she said in real life, she dreads reading the morning newspaper headlines. LOL

To the Tower with the lot of them, I say. But what to eat and not get agita ourselves?  WELL... we chose some pizza, boneless chicken and breadsticks.  Everything was tasty and good. 

This Pizza Hut isn't bad and Paul the Manager, makes you feel welcome, while double checking your order before you go out the door. Nice

So Three and a half Stars \"A-Okay\", bordering on being a \"Fan\"."}

I called to let him know only to find someone had already order pizza..... I called to cancel my order with no issue.... I tried to cancel online but I screwed it up... somehow my credit card processed my order 7 times (I am sure this is my fault).  this pizza hut took care of this without a lot of fuss.  greatful    and so enjoy their pizza.  (we order a lot on 3rd shift at the hospital )"}
{"text":"Had pizza, wings, and bread delivered to our hotel.  Food came fast and hot.   Only complaint, which is a BIG complaint, NO plates or napkins.  Guess they thought we had are own in our suitcases."}
{"text":"My order was supposed to been delivered at 11 AM at the Courtyard Marriott. they didn't get to me till 12:. They first called me to tell me the driver got in a wreck at 11:23. I get another phone call at 11:51 telling me the new  lady manager inside gave him the wrong address. I got another phone call at 12:04 from the delivery guy that he's still lost. He finally gets to the hotel at 12:09. ITS GETS BETTER. THEY DONT HAVE MY ORDER RIGHT. 

This has to be the craziest service I have EVER received. I should of known this seeing that they have 2 star rating. Wow!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"How does a Pizza Hut run out of garlic breadsticks & medium crust? Love Pizza Hut crust.  I'd like to know who the ordering manager is.  I was on hold for over 20 mins supposedly my pizza was going to be done in 5 mins next thing you know after 20 mins on hold - they had run out of both garlic breadsticks & medium crusts.  I then requested large pizza only to be told that my order would now take 1.5 hours to be delivered.  Isn't the point of Pizza Hut that it is quicker then going to the local Harris Teeter & grabbing a take & bake pizza?  This location has now failed me 3x in delivering in excess of 60 mins each time it has been delivered online.  How is this allowed to happen?  This has soured me on Pizza Hut.  I will attempt to receive delivery from another location but will not go to the South Blvd location again."}
{"text":"Ordered garlic knots pizza and wings, ready at the time it said it would be and Sayed the guy working the front was really cool and helpful!"}
{"text":"We opened the pizza box and a cockroach came flopping out and scuttled across our counter.  Needless to say, we won't be ordering from this location again.  We have NEVER had a cockroach in our house and this grossed us out.  They need to check their boxes before they send them out to people's homes!  So nasty and a waste of $23.00!"}
{"text":"Order at 2:22 pm pizza never arrived, called at 3:18 pm was told he's on his way. What a joke asked to just cancel and to give me a refund, will see if the lady does. I'll wait her 3-5 business days like she stated but I will never order from here again."}

{"text":"I like Pizza Hut pizza, but this place is slow and often gets my order wrong. I've only ever done delivery and have never received my order in under an hour. I've been digging the balsamic drizzle, and 50% of the time that I request it, I don't get it. Same goes for soda. The drivers are always nice, though."}
{"text":"THIS STORE IS AWFUL! Twice when I have placed a DELIVERY they have called me to tell me they are no longer delivering even though it says on the site that they are delivering and have asked me to come pick it up. Then when I respond with that's why I got delivery, they tell me sorry and tell me they won't deliver it. The few times I have been able to get them to deliver, they take forever, which at least I can get them to deliver it then. Plus when they do cancel my order it takes forever to actually get a refund. Whoever, runs this location needs to either seriously reevaluate how they manage their store and their rude employees (PS Good luck calling them and getting through) or they need to be reevaluated for this position as it is clearly not a suitable fit."}
{"text":"Came here to try it out since the remodel. Horrible service, ordered specifically 2 medium pizzas, Motz sticks, Cesar salad, and wings. Never got the dressing for my salad, asked for plates said they will be right back and never returned. Never got my Motz sticks... Asked for refund, been sitting for over 30 min waiting for my refund since according to the staff they never had it on the menu. But I paid for it... hmmmm? Very disappointed, not coming back. Zach was cool, that's probably the only plus.."}

I ordered take out Pizza Supream
First I got no special even was on TV 2 med. 3 Toping $7.00. Than when I got the delivery 1 he and 30 min later and we live just 3 min away from thwn. Pizza was cold and Burned tasted very old I spend $27.00. Without the top they automatically add $5.00 on for delivery when I contacted them Manager said we can't do nothing about it we are closing in 5 min. 
I will never go back to them.
It is such a SHAME. I like ordering from PIZZA Hut. 
I hope someone check into this plus their store remote very clean. 
I seen them wear no hair net and not wash their hands after they moped the floor."}
{"text":"Terrible service! Walked in, stood at the take out desk for exactly 7 minutes, before I had to make a call (pretending to be a take out customer) so someone could come to the desk to serve me. 

The staff let my food wait on the desk for about 5 minutes before letting me know, and once they alerted me, they greeted me with \"hey buddy, don't you want you p'zone.\" Yes I do, now if I'm there for take out, why not bring it out to me.

Avoid this place at all costs."}
{"text":"Everything was as I ordered... One reason why it was not 5 star... I was curious as to why my pizza was \"separated\" and not a \"circle\""}
{"text":"We've given this location SO many chances, but each time our experience is terrible. We visited their buffet twice (thinking we may have just hit it on a bad night the first time) during their Wednesday night buffet deal, but regretted it both times. Both times the service was terrible (waitress was unfriendly and never checked in with us-got no refills), the pizza looked and tasted like it'd been sitting under the heat lamps all day, the topping selections on the buffet were uncommon toppings that my husband nor I liked, and they brought out one fresh pizza to add to the buffet the entire time we were there (again, an odd topping). We both got sick from the buffet both times we tried it. We ordered delivery from this location this weekend, as we wanted to take advantage of their $5 menu and had guests who like Pizza Hut pizza, but sadly, our experience wasn't much better. The breadsticks tasted great, but our pizza looked like it'd been sitting out forever, was cold, and had very little cheese. Again, my husband nor I felt well after eating the pizza. This location has many issues they need to resolve before we will be giving them any more business."}
{"text":"From 12/17/2016

12:45PM - Placed order to be delivered to Monte Carlo. Order was supposed to be delivered at 1:16PM.

1:15PM - received a call from a woman thinking that our order was downstairs and ready to be picked up. Instead she called to inform that they're out of grilled cheese stuffed crust. So our pizza wasn't even made yet, awesome. I asked her how much longer it will take, she said within 8-10 minutes and make sure to wait downstairs by the valet because delivery guy can't go up. So down to the lobby we go. 

1:30PM - No sign of pizza guy. Called Pizza Hut, a man said our delivery guy JUST went out the door. 

1:40PM - still waiting out in the cold, delivery guy finally calls and confirms location.

1:50 PM - PIZZAAAAAAAAA

Way to take over an hour to fulfill our order and be completely inaccurate in ETA, Pizza Hut. Only an extra star because our delivery guy, Ermias, was very polite and apologetic even though I knew it was probably not his fault. He even gave us one of his own plastic bags from his trunk to help us carry our food up to our room. Thanks Ermias!"}
{"text":"Omg!!! By far the worst location I have ever been in... I placed an online order and I knew it wasn't ready yet but I let the young man know I wanted to pay now.. his response was \"oh yea you got a minute on that\" none of the employees are in uniform, they are loud and ghetto.. I mean yelling at each other while there are customers in the lobby.. the young man was even yelling at   Co-workers while checking out guest!! Consistent yelling.. he constantly said \"PAPA JOHNS WANT ME! I'm not for this Pizza Hut life!\" I have no idea how this location is in business with so many other pizza places..the experience alone is enough for me to never come back.. I'm currently watching a worker handle cheese sticks for the stuff crust with her bare hands.. no gloves..you would think they would try to tone it down with a customer sitting right here.. just goes to show you never know who is watching!!  P.s. The kid who checked me out just walked to the front door, opened it and SPIT!! The GM Needs to get in here ASAP."}
{"text":"So I ordered yesterday a large pepperoni pan pizza. Simple yes? The delivery girl was nice even though the pizza was a little late than they said, but pizza places get busy and that's fine. It happens. Whatever. When I opened the box it looked like it was a tad overdone and they barely put any cheese on it! There were spots where cheese was missing! I'm not paying to get extra cheese as a topping for them to get it right. It's ridiculous! It's a crime to leave bald tomato sauce patches on a pizza unless it's Neapolitan style pizza from a fancy pizza restaurant. 
I had to eat so I ate it anyway and it was all right, but I felt a little sick afterwards, but this was probably due to pepperoni pizza has a lot of grease that didn't agree with my stomach. This is normal for me, but I love pizza. Will not order from here again, but maybe give it time and try way later down the road. Maybe."}
{"text":"I tried this place twice.

First time my order mysteriously got canceled and nobody notified me. When my pizza never showed up I called and found out. I had to resubmit my order, it took me close to four hours to get one pizza.

I decided to give them another shot. It took two and half hours to get my pizza delivered and i was told 45 minutes. I received no apologies or explanation as to why it took so long.

There are plenty of pizza places in the area. Do not go to this one."}
{"text":"Ridiculous- I ordered my pizza more than 1 hr ago for delivery - nobody showed up!:-/ very irresponsible management.  So disappointing.  I find this unbelievable.  I try not to leave bad reviews for any business but this one is so bad that I have to let ppl know."}
{"text":"This pizza hut is only delivery or carry out.  The pizza we ordered was supposed to have extra cheese but we definitely did not get what we paid for.  The only reason I scored it with 2 stars was because the person, Lucas,  who helped me was very friendly and polite."}
{"text":"This is the second and last time that I will be disappointed by this establishment. I had people over for the NCAA basketball big 12 championship game and was hoping for better service.. I paid extra for sauces and parmesan, which I did not receive, and upon arrival of my order was given a price ten dollars over what I was told when I completed my order. I will never again order from here, nor would I recommend anyone to frequent this restaurant."}
{"text":"Everything is perfect as far as service and prices, but the menu is getting a bit old. We should also be able to change/add engredients onto items like sandwiches. Pizza Hut allows you to delete and add engredients or add extra or less, and you can add mushrooms or banana peppers (for example), even though they weren't originally on the sandwich. 
Very speedy delivery and courteous drivers!"}
{"text":"After having been a customer here,  for over 15 years, tonight was the last time I'm ever setting foot in this establishment. 
I think the restaurant has new owners and management,  and it shows in a really bad way. Gone are all the familiar,  cheery and welcoming staff.  I made an online order at 8pm, was told to pickup at 8.26pm. I arrived just shy of 8.30pm and paid for my order.  My pizza was nowhere to be seen because it wasn't even made. I waited till 8.45pm to  get my pizza.  I requested green peppers on half and obviously it wasn't that way.  The manager accused me of lying and said,  look at your order,  it does not say that anywhere.(in a very accusing and bad tone).  He then says,  I'll make you another one.  I said,  do you think I want to wait for ANOTHER pizza?  He didn't even apologise for not making my first pizza,  then wanted me to wait again.  This place has a terrible manager with no customer service skills and the other staff aren't any better.  A sorry would have sufficed,  my daughter could pick the peppers off but his attitude was terrible. I understand orders can get missed but his handling of the situation was bad.  I'm used to Chinese service that isn't very polite but at least  they're competent.  People here are rude and incompetent.  The food,  by the way,  was fine."}
{"text":"Pizza was more than 45 mins past the 1 hour promised delivery time. Called store repeatedly (7 times over 30 mins period) to see what was going on and was hung up on. When pizza finally arrived I advised the driver that I didn't feel it was fair for me to pay full price - she said fine and took the food back.  Finally got through to manager and he advised that it is a Friday and 2 hours for my food is to be expected. He said I should have insisted she leave the food and then he would have given me a $5 credit.  He advised that it was my fault because I did not insist she leave the food?  He was upset with me because now HE was out the product for my $12 order??!  This is not the first ridiculous experience with Lawyers Rd Pizza Hut. But it will def be my last."}
{"text":"The manager has a terrible attitude! Not helpful and does not care whether you buy pizza here or not! So... I won't. Now driving past this Pizza Hut to the one on Eastern Ave. Very friendly and service is quick for take out. Worth the drive when the local guy doesn't care!"}
{"text":"If I could give this place a 0 I would.  Anthony is a terrible manager.  As a manager when someone on your team messes up and gives a customer the wrong order as a manager you should own up and say sorry and immediately give them a New pizza and or give them a coupon to order another day.  I will never order from this Pizza Hut again and if you want to keep this place up and running I would look for new management.  These people definitely need training."}
{"text":"I been going here for years, to me seems like they get better Everytime nothing bad to say about this deep pan pizza place..."}
{"text":"Hawaiian pizza was yummy. Will have to order it with extra pineapple next time though, there was just not enough pineapple for me. Mushroom and bacon pizza my Mum created was outstanding! Hersheys Chocolate chip cookie pie rocks! Delivery guy was sweet and friendly. Delivery time was ten mins past what it said online but the pizza made up for it lol"}
{"text":"If 0 stars were an option, that's what they would get. The wait time for delivery is absolutely ridiculous. When they give a coupon for a free pizza to make up for it....another two hour wait. This location is either understaffed or staffed with incompetent people.  Gives the franchise a bad name. I grew up on Pizza Hut, and now I'm done. Way to drive away a lifetime customer."}
{"text":"I would give this place negative stars if I could...

My friends and I were guests at the Vdara hotel and wanted to have a quick dinner before lining up at the ridiculous hour of 8:30 at Marquee at the Cosmopolitan.

Pizza seemed like a great solution. Affordable, delicious, and able to be delivered to our room while we got ready to go out.

WRONG! First warning sign...the guy who answered the phone did not know where the Vdara hotel was. Mind you, this pizza hut was only 2 miles from the Vdara and part of the new CityCenter complex. How could you miss it? You can see it from the 15! To add to that, it took me more than 20 minutes to give the dumbass the address and our order. The genius on the phone must have asked for the hotel's zip code 6 or 7 times. Yes. I spent more time giving this incompetent excuse for an employee the hotel's address rather than giving him the actual food order. After all that, we were told that the pizza would be there in 30 minutes.

After an hour, we called to inquire about the status of our order. I was informed that our order could not be found in the system using our name, phone number, or address. After our order was placed only an hour before! Again, the employee on the phone was rude and extremely incompetent and could offer no explanation as to what had happened to our food. Rude employee wouldn't even apologize.

Absolutely terrible. Worst Pizza Hut experience ever."}
{"text":"I only gave them 3 stars because they are on time. We ordered from them today and once last month. We loved our old Pizza Hut in peoria. But this one is down the street and the pizza is cold and EVERY SINGLE TIME THEY FORGET OUR SODA!! I'm not one to get upset over something that is not that expensive only $3 but that's the key to the meal. Last time I called to let them know the driver forgot it and that the driver said he would go back. They said they could credit $3 ( I never received the credit and the soda showed up an hour later after we already ate).This time I just waited for the driver to come back with the soda and again an hour later. By the way it's only 10 min from our house. So they lost a customer who just moved to the area and loves Pizza Hut"}
{"text":"Order my pizza at 9pm got a delivery time of 11:03pm and my pizza never came! The store is closed and I have no one to resolve my issue till the next day. Meanwhile my family is going to bed hungry."}
{"text":"about 2 weeks late :) we ordered about 7 pizzas online for my daughters birthday. They could not have been made any better. Perfection! Crust was crispy and yummy. Just the right amount of sauce. 5 pan pepperoni, 1 pan supreme, and 1 stuffed crust pepperoni. Made and fresh out of the oven at the exact time I selected. May have ordered to many BUT they were great reheated in the oven after school for the kiddies! Really enjoy Pizza Hut. definitely a loyal customer!"}
{"text":"The food is pretty standard for a PH, but the service is sub par. I usually have to call several times and/or wait on hold for 5-10 minutes before someone takes my order (even when they're not busy). 

Then I also spend another 5-10 minutes waiting in the store. They need to up their customer service significantly."}
{"text":"If i could give 0 stars, i would. I had a coupon for a free medium one topping pizza with the purchase of a large. I ordered  a large for 18 dollars and for the medium, i only got HALF with toppings. They would not give me the medium for free! When I questioned this, their explanation was that i got a veggie and thats too many toppings for free! I only got HALF of the pizza with toppings??!  The coupon had NO stipulations whatsoever. I know it is only a matter of a few dollars but that is definitely NOT adequate customer service, by any means. I get pizza every friday and they just lost a customer over a few bucks."}
{"text":"This is the absolute worst Pizza Hut I have ever had the displeasure of ordering from. If I could give it negative stars I would. This is the 2nd time I have ordered online and gotten to the store and had to sit in the drive thru forever. Today took the cake! First, when I arrived there was a car in front of me. It took 10+ minutes for them to get their order. You would think the employee would stay at the window since there were other cars in drive thru. Not! I pulled up, the bell rang and no one came to the window- ever. I finally had to call inside the store after sitting there for at least 10 minutes to ask if anyone was going to come to the window. Finally that cook comes over and gets the manager for me. What a waste of time that was. She gave me some poor excuse about having to take care of something in the back and there only being  one person up front. Ok if you you know that, then as a manager, YOU should be available to help out. I told them to keep the pizza because who wants a cold pizza?? Never once did she apologize or offer to make it right. I will never ever go to this Pizza Hut again. Save yourself the headache and go elsewhere, trust me."}
{"text":"Both pizza was cold and one was cold and burnt smh it taken them 1hr45mins plus to bring it! call the first time and they say it was on its way that was at 6:45 call back again because still no pizza it's 7:30 now no pizza and i stay less than a mile away from them... the lady just felt out lied because when I called back at 7:30 my pizza just had went out at 7:15 when you told me my pizza out for delivery remind you that she say my pizza was already out for delivery at 6:45 smh long story short just don't get any thing from here!!! I ordered here again to see if they get it right!! nope they didn't they say it will be a 1hr wait and it taken them 3hr.... And when we call them the Manger try to make it seem like it was our fault and  going to say why I didn't order before dark, we did it was 4:10 when we order... Little do she know I was recording the whole time when we was on the phone and  I will be putting this on YouTube and sending to the corporate office"}
{"text":"Ordered online to be picked up via carry-out. Ordered from this location because it was closest to Case Western, where I am currently a student. This Pizza Hut is a small storefront, with only 2 seats available to wait for your pizza. No sit-in dining. It is located in the plaza that also houses Family Dollar, a grocery store, a DMV, and Dollar Mart. Also across the street from the CVS at Euclid and 79th St.

Price: Ordered the online 7.99 large two-topper with a variety of vegetables to my liking. Had to pay in-store however. Weird.

Pizza: I ordered a half-and-half pizza, customizing each side for my friend and I. The website said it would take about 40 minutes for it to be ready. I was willing to deal with that wait time since the last I ordered pizza in Cleveland was from Valentino's and that was a horrible experience. Even though my place is only 10 minutes (driving) from the Pizza Hut, by the time I arrived home and bit into my first slice, I realized the pizza was cold. I was starving, so I gobbled the rest and accounted the cold slice to the blizzard that was occuring outside when I went to pick the pizza up.

However, the second time my friend and I ordered from this same place (this time via delivery), the pizza arrived stone-cold once again! And this time cold weather was no excuse, as the delivery guy took it out of one of those heat-conserving pizza bags. Something sketchy going on here.

Conclusion: Until I find a better place for pizza (I really pray that I do...sigh) Pizza Hut will have to do."}
{"text":"Drove by and saw a Pizza Hut restaurant so we decided to check it out. Excellent service.  Good pizza! Good wings!  Nice to have a sit down Pizza Hut!"}
{"text":"Pizza Hut has a large with 2 toppings for $7.99 when you order online!  I was craving that crispy buttery crust that you can only get from Pizza Hut.  

Ordered my large with mushrooms and sausage with a 2 litter and my total was about $16.  My pizza came hot and fast and just the way I like it,  well done!"}
{"text":"Been there a few times and continually disappointed in timeliness of both carry out/delivery."}
{"text":"This Pizza Hut is the worst!!  I ordered the Big Dinner Box option online because it said it was available, only to find out that it was not available after they canceled my order and did not notify me.  I called back and they told me what happened, then they charged me the same price for three medium pizzas as I would have paid for the big dinner box!!  When I called today to order another pizza they had me on hold for over 10 minutes!!  Do not order from this Pizza Hut take your business elsewhere!!"}
{"text":"I've been a long time loyal customer to a rival restaurant, but recent negative experiences led me to Pizza Hut.
I ordered online. Website clear, simple, easy.
You got my order correct & complete.
Your estimated delivery time was spot on.
Food was delicious. Even the picky toddler ate everything.
Priced just a little more than rival, but service & quality make it worth it.
Thanks.
Will be back."}
{"text":"Note to pizza stores, your peak time is Saturday night. Have your staff ready for a lot of orders. If you tell a customer to come pick a pizza up in 30 minutes, you better have it ready in 30 minutes. This was not the case with this Pizza Hut tonight.  I'm sitting in a parking lot with about 15 cars all waiting for pizza pick up.  I understand that things may be busy on a Saturday, but set the right expectations with me. If it's going to take an hour, tell me to come in an hour. Don't tell me to come in a 1/2 hour.  I went through the inconvenience of picking the pizza up, it should be ready upon arrival!!!"}
{"text":"We get the big box deal often. It's two smaller pizzas, breadsticks and sauce, and a pasta for $20.00. It's a quick, cheap deal for the family when we need dinner and it don't have time to cook. I always order online which is a great site, and quick and easy to do. I always do pickup the pizza because it isn't a far drive.  We've learned that even though it states that our breadsticks come with sauce, they NEVER included it. We check before we leave now to make sure we receive it. The store is always busy and full of people. When I was there a few days ago there was water leaking from the ceiling, which looked gross!  The good news is, my pizza and toppings are always correct, and my order is always ready when I get there.  Better customer service and a cleaner store would help this location out!"}
{"text":"I have loved Pizza Hut pizza, almost my entire life. When I was in grade school, there was a book club button that allowed us to earn stickers toward a free pan pizza. Free pizza?!?! Heck yes! It wasn't hard to get me to read the school books with free pizza on the menu.
That said, the Pizza Hut in FM isn't the best on service. Late deliveries, incorrect orders and forgotten pizzas, is INCREDIBLY common. It seems so simple with technology today, but you'd be amazed what you can screw up. 
Ultimately, I still love the pizza itself. The ingredients coming to a finished product of bread, sauce and cheese....can't be beat. Just wish the service was better. It's been several years I've ordered from this location and it doesn't seem to change. C'est La Vie"}
{"text":"We ordered carry out. The screen said ours was ready as well as two others. There was clearly a bunch of orders that you can see behind the counter but the employee couldn't seem to find any of our orders. Finally pulls our order from the back which is fine but amazing to see all those pizzas just sitting... Maybe for delivery? The employee was very nice and this location is so close to home so we will be back as they do have good food."}
{"text":"On May 19 at 10:00 am I placed an order with Pizza Hut at 2835 N 16 st to deliver $180.00 order to AZ State Veterans home for our assistant directors last day going away party. I spent Monday Tuesday Wednesday Thursday Friday getting money and card signing done .She had to leave 12:15 that day At 11:20am called Pizza Hut at 2835 N 16 st and ask when is the  pizza and pasta going to arrive a young woman at Pizza Hut said at 10:00 AM they had 100 pizzas ordered by a school nearby they had to take care of their order first. When I asked when our order would be delivered she said our order was being prepared don't expect it before 11:30 called again at 11:45 was told the order would not be there until 12:00 called again at 12 o'clock girl said order was being packed in to the truck for delivery and order would be at Az State Vets home  at 1 PM. We canceled the order and was hung up on. I was so embarrassed when I had to find all the people that gave me money and give them their money back. I was in tears because I knew everyone was very hungry. Our assistant administrator and her 9 year old daughter gave me a hug and said don't worry about it's pizza huts fault.

         THANK. YOU. PIZZA HUT!!!"}
{"text":"You always know what your getting with Pizza Hut... nothing fancy or special, but they are usually consistent.
Pizza was the same, delivery was quick, and delivery lady was very friendly."}
{"text":"Multiple horrible experiences from this location! I have placed a delivery order and 20 minutes later they call me to tell me I have to pick it up because they don't have a driver. This time I placed an order for carry out and when I arrive they claim they never got my order and that they only have medium pan crust pizza available, nothing else! The location is falling apart, door handle literally hanging off. Any time I was able to get delivery it takes over an hour every single time and I live one mile away. Managers need to make some serious improvements because this location is a disgrace to the Pizza Hut brand!"}
{"text":"Seriously... 7 people working here on a Tuesday night and it takes 45 minutes for wings?? I used to work at pizza hut, and those bitches take like, 10/15 minutes to cook, sauce, and box up.. mind you, I'm ordering for carry out, so drive time is not included in this wait time.. I friggin love Pizza Hut but guess where I won't be coming back for my wing fix?? Shameful work ethic from these people.. just pitiful.."}
{"text":"Very friendly staff and very clean! Pizza was good too. Good service makes the world of difference :)   New to this area so I'm happy that it's within walking distance and I like that they have order on-line specials."}
{"text":"Had unexpected guests kids and they all wanted Pizza Hut (wouldn't have guessed in a million years!). 

Quickly check the website and it showed that on Saturdays there was a medium veggie lovers on sale for $10. Good price for PH, but expensive if compared to other chains. Absolutely no changes were allowed even for changing from green peppers to say hot peppers or any changes period. 

Ordered and drove straight to the location and lo and behold the pizzas were ready. I was literally there for 90 seconds including the payment time. Wow!

Needless to say the kids loved it. The pizzas seemed a bit overdone, but kids did not seem to even notice!!"}
{"text":"Once again, worst Pizza Hut in North Las Vegas, besides MLK/Alexander. My office ordered from this rotten place last week, they showed up an hour and a half late and were unprofessional! So we decided to give them another shot & ordered for pickup, my order was still NOT ready. The manager had nothing to say nor was she even concerned about us as customers. If I could give them 0 out of 5 stars I would"}
{"text":"Horrible!!! I was told by a manager that they would replace an order that they sent me cold and with mushrooms that I did not order after I throw away the pizza and callback for the refund, they say it's nowhere to be found! Shady business! Someone is stealing there and they take it out on customers. TERRIBLE OPPERATION!!!!!"}
{"text":"I received my purchase and I received boneless wings instead of what was ordered which was traditional wings. I contacted the franchise and the young lady told me they would bring the rest of the order right away. That wasn't the problem, I was actually pleased about the customer service but when the delivery driver brought the traditional wings one of the wings was outside the container in the bag. I'm very upset with the way these mistakes occurred. I'm sure someone noticed a wing in the bag. Furthermore the container didn't have sauce on the outside so someone had to have placed the wing in the bag. This is very disturbing. This was my first time ordering at this location and I don't see myself ordering again."}

{"text":"We have had pizza delivered every Friday night for 2 years for us, our kids still at home and our grandkids. Never had one problem with them or the food that was delivered. They will periodically give us free items and will call us if they are out of something we order, since we use the Pizza Hut app. Delivery Team is always friendly and speaks to our kids and our dog Molly.

{"text":"Always deliver way past the estimated time. Food never feels fresh, even when I pick it up. Today I got my food and my order wasn't even correct.. Won't be ordering from here again. I feel as if I waste money every time I order from here."}
{"text":"Have only stopped in for take out.  If you don't order ahead it will take over 10 minutes.  The staff is not overly friendly but not rude either."}
{"text":"I wasn't impressed.  I ordered online.  They called me to tell me they were all out of sweet chili sauce I wanted on my wings.  Delivery took 20 minutes more than the time it showed online, and the pizza was not fresh.  When I order dominos, the pizza is always hot and fresh when It gets here.  That is funny because Pizza Hut is way closer to my apartment than dominoes.  Surprisingly though, the wings that I got instead, garlic Parmesan, ended up being my favorite."}
{"text":"Ordered wings and pizza. Delivery time good. Delivery person WORST EVER. I paid on CC BUT I always tip cash,  when driver looked at screen his comment  was what no tip for driver. This infuriated  me and I informed  him he wasn't getting one and I showed him the $3 in my hand.His reply I was just joking. NOT FUNNY. Food was 
actually  good.
It gets better I called customer service was asked my phone# and major intersection. Was told  no order for my number and we don't deliver there? I called the 310-1010 # he said i should call main number. 
I finally called a # which  was in the US. That was the only person who was empathetic. 
I have ordered many times from this restaurant  but never again. There are 5 pizza restaurants  at least  between  my place and store.
One star cause I couldn't  give mone"}
{"text":"The pizza was decent and was ready at the promised time, but I was not satisfied with the fact that they did not provide us with paper plates or utensils. If I was eating at home or if they were delivering to my home, it would not have been a big deal. However, if I am ordering 2 large pizzas for carry-out, please have some paper plates and utensils on hand. They gave us approximately 15 napkins... Other than that, the pizza was satisfactory (although I do prefer other pizza places) & didn't make anyone sick, so that's a positive. I'm not going to say that I wouldn't go here again because of the paper plate issue, but if I am ordering pizza on the whim to eat at the park, I would not choose this place."}
{"text":"This Pizza Hut is a newer one thus it's a little nicer inside. They have a salad bar and a lunch pizza buffet. Waitress was friendly and the place was clean."}
{"text":"This place is so weird. First time we ordered we got the fried pies. They were all dumped in together and they were not even cooked right. So I called, complained and they gave me a $10 credit to my phone number. I figured it was late, stuff happens.

I go to order again today and my pizza is so greasy, tastes weird and has so much cheese on it that they had to cook it extra to melt it or something because the pepperoni is burnt to nothing. I mean this is insane. I don't know if it is management, or if it is cooking staff. But this is definately the last time I will be ordering from this place."}
{"text":"ordered online, then an hour later they said it was going to take an additional hour.  Ruined our panthers football game!!  Never ordering from pizza hut again."}
{"text":"HORRIBLE Customer service. This is the third time I have ordered from this store for delivery after having gone to pick up many times before that. The first order, they gave me the wrong flavor. The second time, I told them I wanted to pay by credit card and they hung up on me before I could give them the number. The third time, last night, was the worst though. I placed an order through the internet. The site told me I out get my pizza a half hour later. After a full hour I called to find out what was wrong. They told me my order was canceled because I was a new customer and they had to confirm my number before they could deliver. Two problems, with this, one, I'm NOT a new customer and two, noone called my phone (which was next to me charging at the time in question). The employee that answered the phone even remembered talking to me when my first order was incorrect. I have used the same phone number and address each time and it was in the system. Their solution? Just replace my order and make me wait again for the pizza. Oh yeah and recharge me so I'd have two pending charges for one pizza. I told them that it wasn't acceptable. That it was the stores mistake and they needed to fix it somehow. The Manager on Duty finally offered me a discount and then proceeded to tell me it would cost exactly what I was already being charged. It's not a discount if you are charging me the same amount!! People need to learn to do their jobs correctly (call if you say you called for example) or get out of customer service."}
{"text":"Tried the pizza and salad buffet because we used to love going to those in Vegas years ago. Pizza was sitting under the heat lamps not looking very appetizing. We tried a piece and it was barely warm. They brought out plain cheese pizza which I love but the crust underneath was pale - totally undercooked, a big no no for me. Pepperoni pizza was very salty. Salad bar was blah, lettuce was starting to turn rusty. This place not even worth a 2nd chance."}
{"text":"I called for a delivery order. I ordered one large pizza and the lady said it would take 45 mins to 1 hour. I said ok and hung up. I ordered at 3:54pm and i called again to see where my pizza is at 4:00 pm. The lady who picked up said arrival is for 4:15pm. I told her that the lady who took my order said 45 mins to 1 hour. She said she couldn't do anything about it and was so rude. I asked for her name, she wouldnt give it, i asked for her first name only, she wouldnt give it. I called customer service and they filed a complaint to this store and said I should be receiving a call from the manager. This store is just so rude and knows absolutely nothing about customer service. Her tone was unacceptable. My pizza ended up arriving at 4:20 pm, still later than the \"arrival time\". Never go to this store.

Update: Pizza Hut still hasn't called me and it's been 4 days already. I ended up calling the store and spoke with the manager. She was rude with attitude. I asked why she didnt call me , no answer. I hung up and callrd customer service again and complained. I dont understand why it takes so much to get a sincere, genuine apology. The customer service at the store is terrible and unacceptable. I was told I'll be hearing back from the store- we'll see about that. 

I'm really in awe. This is a franchise store of one of the lrgest companies. Im disappointed and will never ever order pizza hut."}
{"text":"If I could do a zero rating I would!  Placed an order online and after doing it was telling me it would be two hours! Well its too long to wait no problem just CXL the order  Well that's were the fun happens after being hung up on 5 times when you call it just goes to some awful music and then after a 15 to 20 hold time it hangs up on you.  .  I will never go again to this place!  Finally talked to a rep who I explained to him what happened and he says you need to calm down!!!!    WHAT!  ? He instead of hearing what I'm saying to him he says we record these calls So what!  What are you going to do  call the police!  I did not make threats to him,  I JUST WANTED TO CLX THE ORDER!

{"text":"Ordered $50 worth of pizza and the wait was 1 hour and 30 minutes. After waiting forever, I heard a loud thud but didn't think anything of it at the time. The delivery guy drops our pizzas!! He didn't apologize when I answered the door. (I would've been understanding if he apologized and try to make up for it but he acted like nothing happened.)
I called Pizza Hut back and told the manager what happened and accused us of dropping it. He offered for remakes BUT I had to give back the bad pizzas and wait another 2 hours!!! Obviously I wanted our money back but he couldn't do that but give us \"credit\". 
Because of their unintelligent staff at this location, I am no longer a customer."}
{"text":"THEY MESSED UP MY ORDER... But resolved the issue! I ordered two pizzas and a 8 wings for carry out. When I got home I opened the wings to find that they gave me the wrong flavor wings. I called the store to see what could be done, they were nice enough to have one of the delivery drivers bring me the correct wings at no extra cost! Very cool! Thanks!"}
{"text":"Had a Pizza yesterday,not the same quality and delivery service extremely rude.Will do my business with Dominoes or a frozen pizza from supermarket and avoid this place forever."}
{"text":"We are located a block away from this place and it took an hour to be delivered. We ordered stuffed crust with marinara sauce. We got a lukewarm badly made pizza with no sauce. We decided to warm it up when we realized the pizza was raw. The pizza was just dough in the middle. We called to complain and the manager and he did offer a 5$ credit and the marinara sauce be delivered. But the fact that we have to cook our pizza after getting it delivered is ridiculous. The pictures are before we cooked it at home. You can't really see the raw dough you have to feel it. But I took a closeup anyways."}
{"text":"Our pizza was good, but the service was slower than slow. Our server disappeared for long periods of time."}
{"text":"This location is take-out only. The service is what you expect from Pizza Hut at this type of place and that is \"good\".

Parking is adequate it is easy to pop in, get your order and then leave. Because I order pizza well-done it almost always takes longer for them to get my order ready than the estimate given on-line. I have only ordered from this location on-line."}
{"text":"Pizza was awful. I waited over an hour for the pizza to be delivered, expecting it to be FRESH. But no, the pizza tasted like it was sitting on a counter for a long time, the cheese was hard and not melted, and the breadsticks were stale. Never again."}
{"text":"This is a great little Pizza Hut. I have been here several times for carry-out and have received good service.

One odd-ball experience that I had here awhile back was when the place was robbed. I wasn't at the location when it was robbed (thankfully), but I received a call when I was on my way telling me that my pizza wasn't done. I guess the thief stole it.... Anyway, I waited a little more for them to make my pizza, but they did give me a free 2-liter and were completely apologetic."}
{"text":"It's a shame this place has terrible review because the service and food I have received from this Pizza Hut have always been to the highest of my expectations.

I order on my iPhone for carrry-out and it is ready in 15 mins! Love that.

Food is good too. Pizza Hut beats all chain pizza restaurants, in my opinion. And, this restaurant does a good job."}
{"text":"We're not happy with the Braeside location for the $7.99 lunch deal on weekdays, so we went to the Shawnessy location today.  There was the same manager that we've seen in Braeside.  Not good.  Got there at 12:30 - no food.  Lots of hungry people waiting.....No good.  They brought some pizza out, it went in a couple of minutes, and again we were waiting....  There weren't that many people there, but only one waitress who thought they were very busy and that the weather must have brought the business.  I overheard the big managerial man say that the price is not $7.99 anymore and that they're not providing free pop refills anymore, either.  We got the bill and the price was changed to $8.99 but the pop was only one time charged.  The sign outside the building says $7.99 for lunch pizza.  I was not impressed.  Give it a miss, folks.  Not worth the trouble dealing with liars and cheats.  Everyone wants to scam you one way or another to make their fast buck, I guess."}

The walk up counter is filthy, not a menu in site and the staff left me standing here for over five minutes without greeting me even though two employees walked right by. Was told 15/20 mins on my carry out pizza order and 35 mins later... nada, and same problem again trying to get attention of the staff. You can hear personal convos from the back perfectly clearly and yet no one seems concerned in actually helping customers. Honestly, just go elsewhere, this place is a MESS!"}
{"text":"One of the better Pizzahuts in Calgary.
Servers were courteous and service was quick. Dine in is always better than carry-out.

Good place to dine in late."}
{"text":"Had the worst ever Pizzahut experience of my life.

Pizza hut advertises on their every invoice that fillup an online survey at pizzahutlistens.ca and get a special code to avail buy one get one free offer (BOGO). So like last several times we called the call center (only way to redeem) and availed the offer and arrived to pick our pizza.

They refused to honor the offer saying they don't have any such offer. We showed the older invoice (from 5 days ago) with the offer details. They still said they don't know about the offer and that the stores and call center are not connected even when they got the order from the call center.

On calling back and spending 20 mins on phone, pizza hut couldn't figure out how to honor their customer appreciation offer!

At this point we decided to give up the free pizza, and went to a different place. I guess Dominos is the way to go now on!"}
{"text":"The manager Nathan is very rude and doesn't have the first clue about customer service. As a regular Pizza Hut customer if this were my regular store, they would have lost a customer today. The next time my store has an issue I'll order Papa Johns instead of coming here."}
{"text":"First time ordering from this location. First the \"expected\" delivery time went from 30 min to over an hour on a Sunday afternoon - placed at 215. I ordered 2 pizzas and cheese sticks and their 5 dollar 20 oz where you pick 4. After an hour and a half, the delivery driver finally called to say they were here. At this point over an hour over where the original \"expected\" stated. When I met him at my apt he said they were out of the Soda (sierra mist) I ordered and just replaced it. Then the pizzas themselves were cold as dirt. The \"grilled cheese pizza\" was so cold it had practically hardened. Will now drive to huntersville for Pizza Hut as this was the worst I've ever experienced. Wish I had bought a digorno instead."}
{"text":"I have been to this location twice. The first time...no complaints. However, the second time they messed up my order. I gave them two stars instead of one because they gave me a free pizza in order to make up for the mistake they made with my original pizza. The reason I gave such a low rate is because while waiting for my pizza, I saw something that made me throw out all three pizzas as soon as I left the store. The guys in the back were eating wings and one of them was picking the chicken out of his teeth. After he got it out, he went back to making pizzas. Ever since I saw that...I think about this place and it makes me lose my appetite. Sucks because it is in walking distance from my house, but I will go out of my way to avoid this place and give a different pizza place my business."}
{"text":"The worst Pizza Hut in existence. The rudest employees and manager I have ever experienced in my 45 years of life. They are ALWAYS late. They never get the food right, and they attack you when you ask for it correctly or on time."}
{"text":"Staff very rude . Ordered Two large pies for pickup. Arrived to counter where nobody would greet or service me. Only one staff member there that looked at me and turned head to never acknowledge me. Another staff not on clock ask other to at least greet me but she refused . When I said hello I'm here and my pies are sitting in my eye sight she still refuse to say anything . I then had to leave without two pizzas. Another customer watching also left without pizza. Horrible !!!! Service."}
{"text":"I have not had an issue with this location. Pizza is always fresh and ready when I arrive for pickup. App ordering has made the process so much easier. There is a taller/young guy that works there who is always very nice - I don't recall his name."}
{"text":"So we had a very lazy Sunday decided to order Pizza I am disappointed with the size of a large pizza these day's. It looks more like a medium. I am disappointed with the quantity of ingredients placed on the pizza. Margin on the Pizza to the sauce area is more than an inch and a half, more like 2 and a half to three inches of exposed crust. I asked for extra cheese and it just doesn't look like the pizza I have had a million times before. So I called to the PH we got it from. Spoke to Andrea. I told her that I thought the pizza was weak. her response was \" We measure everything\" meaning I the customer was wrong, I have no issue I should not be concerned about the value for my money. She offered to remake or apply credit to my next order. My problem with that is that I will get the same result according to Andrea because they MEASURE EVERYTHING. How do I resolve this issue. I am a Pizza Hut fan who may have to look some where else. Shit! Fucking Andrea I wish you could see my face right now.  When does quality start to be important to maintain customer base. When does customer service go beyond trying to shut me up and actually address the problem. I could have gotten the pizza I had for 5 dollars at Little Cesar's."}
{"text":"Driver forgot the sauces and I waited over hour and a half for my delivery. I'm pretty sure he was on drugs cuzz he had blood shot eyes. ... I'm probably never ordering pizza from here ever again.."}
{"text":"I wish Yelp allowed a different rating for companies that process orders via an app, web site or by phone. 

www.pizzahut.ca was how I ordered my pizza and meal deal. 

The web site for Canada uses postal code to determine the nearest location.  However the postal code has to be split up. A0A 1B1 if not then the search seems to take for ever to process.  The web site also doesn't let Firefox so I had to use Internet Explorer.  

So I get the Game Day meal, 2 medium pizzas, 10 chicken bites, two dipping sauces and a litre bottle of Pepsi, Diet Pepsi or 7 Up. 

You select your first pizza from a list of set orders; meat lovers, Hawaiian.. Etc or you can create your own.  Then you click next and pick your second pizza.  However, if you need to change your pizza order the \"Back\" button had me back to square one.  So I had to reorder both pizzas again.  After you get past that, you select the dipping sauces, then the bites either plain or coated.  A decent selection of flavours for the bites.  I did wish that they offer the sauce on the side for the bites.  

However, after confirming everything I received an error message that the server had issues.  May be it was peak time, but really at 3:50 pm?!?  If that is peak, the web servers need to be replaced.  So I tried again and still got the same message.  Error.  So I tried to find the store number to place my order.  The web site prefers on-line orders not call in.  So I used Yelp! plus the Yelp! Reviews for this store were 3/5 and not 1/5 for the Pizza Hut Delivery across the road. 

So I called the store.  To my surprise they received the order even if I did not get an email or on-line confirmation.  Thankfully I called them.  Had I not I would have been surprised when the person showed up to deliver my order. 

So back to the review.  Pizzas were hot and tasty. The people I ordered the food for loved the dipping sauces and devoured the honey garlic bites.  I could have done with a little less sauce - the bottom bites were drowning.  The bonus item ordered, that was not part of the deal, was the Hershey cookie pan.  Also consumed with reckless abandon.  So with three hungry teens who are picky pizza eaters, it was money well spent."}
{"text":"I've ordered delivery multiple times from this place over the past two months.  They always arrive within 20-25 minutes, which is more than I can say for Pizza Pizza or Pizzaville.  

The thing I love most about this place? Butter chicken pizza!! so creamy, yummy and taste. Also very filling."}
{"text":"I have been going to this location for 13 years and I have received great service each time! The location never seems to get my skinny beach, right though. They always put different ingredients.  Still worth five stars because one time mistake is forgiven!!"}
{"text":"Done with you Pizza Hut. 

I order from this location somewhat regularly and I'm now just beyond over it. More often than not, delivery take 1-2 hours (if not more), and you can guarantee when it does, it will be cold. No discounts, apologies, free pizzas - zero f*cks given by this store. And if you call their location, you'll just get transferred to their general 1-800 number, where you'll sit on hold for 20 mins then get transferred back to the store, where they won't pick up. Pathetic. 

Done with you, your terrible service and your mediocre pizza. Would much rather give my money to any of the other 5769049202 pizza places in this city. 

Do yourself a favour and go anywhere else."}
{"text":"Probably the worst pizza I have ever ordered. I order pizza regularly I used to really really love Pizza Hut by my old apartment but since I moved I hate ordering from Pizza Hut. The quality decreased and I can honestly say I'll never order from this Pizza Hut again. My family didn't even eat the pizza we ordered. It was undercooked, greasy, and just disgusting. The delivery guy didn't give us his name, the pizza looked like it was thrown around, and I would honestly like to have my money back. This is a huge disappointment."}
{"text":"I now see why this place has horrible reviews. After a long day at work my son wanted his favorite meal pizza. Mind you we ordered Pizza Hut a few days before and they gave me the incorrect order. I called to get it replaced and it is as the employees were humiliating me. I ordered a hand tossed pizza with extra sauce because that's how my son likes it. They sure did give me EXTRA SAUCE. They actually put the whole fan of sauce on the pizza. Who in their right mind would even eat this? It's disgusting and disrespectful. I will be getting in contact with Pizza Hut's corporate office. This is absolutely unacceptable and ridiculous. The young lady that answered the phone was very nice and showed lots of empathy. But whom ever made this pizza did this on purpose because they messed up my prior Pizza. As I mentioned I will contact corporate"}
{"text":"This was one of the worst dining experiences I have had in a long time. Mind you, I know this is just a Pizza Hut, so expectations were low going in, but the wife & I were looking for a cheap, quick cheese pizza.

First, the table was not clean, nor was the entire floor. Well worn, and not sweopt up recently. Again it's a PH, so not terribly surprising.

Serevice was slow, the salad bar was nasty, and looked like it had been out a while. The kicker was the pizza. It looked puffy and inflated. When we cut our first piece, we realized it was still warm gooey dough and not cooked at all. I went to the waitress and asked if we could just pay for out salads and leave, which she said was fine. The manager ended up not letting us pay, since we had a bad experience. I wasn't looking for a freebie, but that was a good call on his part.

We ended up ordering a pizza near home and picking it up on the way, and ate our dinner way later than we wanted."}
{"text":"OMG!!!  This was the WORST pizza I have ever seen or tasted.  This was supposed to be a large hand tossed veggie pizza.  The crust was maybe 1/16 in. thick (maybe 1/32).  There was practically no sauce or cheese on it, either. The ingredients that were on the pizza were arranged for a medium size crust so there was like 4 inches of bare nothingness on the outer arc.  

My mother even tried to call customer service just to mention how disappointed we were and we got transferred out of the country for customer service!!!  WHAT'S WITH THAT???  She insisted that she wanted to talk to the Parma Heights OH location.  When she finally got through the manager was rude.  He said the pizza was fine and he even made the pizza himself.  My mother told him he need to go back to school!  lol  

They didn't even offer to make another pizza for delivery.  We will never order from this Pizza Hut again.  And I think the manager should be reprimanded for his awful customer service."}
{"text":"Great service, friendly staff and amazing food. I discovered my local  Pizza Hut after checking their website and noticing not only their great online specials, but their wide selection of flavors.  With great prices and the ability to place an order online and either have it delivered or pick it up in person, when it comes to quality and service, Pizza Pizza does not even come close to this chain.  On a few occasions, the staff made up any unintentional problems with my order by providing me with a alternative solution that shows their great customer service. For example, one time I ordered four extra large pizzas and they only had enough boxes for three.  For the fourth pie, they substituted the fourth pie with two medium pies.  That's great thinking and sold me as a loyal customer.

Staff and drivers are friendly and helpful, Food is great! What else can I say?

HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!"}
{"text":"This is the worst location I have ever dealt with. The last 2 times our orders were completely messed up and when you try to call back the phone rings forever or is busy. Don't bother with this one."}
{"text":"Ordered 2 pizzas, breadsticks and cookie desert... After 1 hour and 45 min of waiting for my food I called to check up on it and was told they were backed up. When I asked to speak with the manager, I was told she (Shelly) was too busy to come to the phone. Completely unacceptable. Poor poor customer service. They offered me a $20 credit on my next order... Lol save the credit because I won't ever be ordering from here again. Ever."}
{"text":"This Pizza Hut is fairly standard.  They have an okay buffet during the week at lunch and some weekend evenings.

The menu is the same that you will see at just about any Pizza Hut across the country.

The service is generally fine - again, nothing above and beyond, but this is Pizza Hut, you are getting exactly what you should be expecting."}
{"text":"Not really a chain delivery person...I love bakery style local places but the one by us is awful. So we figured we'd try here and get one delivered to table instead of house, gotta say makes huge difference. Very good, well made pizza that we all enjoyed! Another good review that was earned by \"Annie\" lol"}
{"text":"This place literally always messes up my order. They always mess up the wings and desserts. I ordered garlic Parmesan before, they gave us regular. Ordered the cookie pizza and got brownies. Irritating workers"}
{"text":"Horrible horrible customer service. I called to have the time changed on my order. The call center wasn't even in the state. Then i go to the Green Street location only to be greeted with the worst customer service. They wouldn't let me change the time of the order. And im not talking like 15 minutes. 45 minutes later.  This is carry out for goodness sake..  Anyway there is much better options. Please be prepared for slow processing times and horrible customer service. Food is the same crappy food pizza hut always is."}
{"text":"Accidentally ordered from this location at 9225 Mentor Ave when I usually order from another store(which is awesome). Walked in and no one around. Finally, a little punk came around and said, \"Juuust waaait  one minute. I'm helppping sooooomeooone.\" Then Shaggy came up and finally gave me my order. And the pizzas were poorly made and not even cut correctly."}
{"text":"Since our previous review, we have ordered takeout here several more times. The food was always delicious and ready right on time. 

The restaurant is clean and the staff is very friendly. 

We wish they had seating. But that's not a deal breaker."}
{"text":"Nothing wrong with the taste of the food. However, every time I order from here there is an issue. Either the food is late, my toppings are wrong, or they forget to bring me something in my order. Ordered today and the driver didnt bring my sodas. Last time I ordered a 12 piece wing to only have 8 wings. Prior to that I ordered half and half toppings and the entire pizza was the wrong ingredients. I will not order delivery from here again."}
{"text":"The Pizza Hut central customer care line is abysmal. There was an error with the order I placed via their app, and when I discovered it upon receiving my pizza, I called. This was not a store issue rather a central issue. Reporting the problem led to me being told that it would take 3-5 days to resolve when I needed my pizza's tonight. I was then told to call the franchise for a central error. 
This took 24 minutes and pizza gone cold. 
I called the store who directed me to customer care. I explained the above and the ludicrousness of this customer service. The store was understanding and have rectified the order. Yes, I am sending back the original order as my purpose is not to scam extra pizza. This specific store understands customer service."}
{"text":"I ordered the 2 topping medium pizza for 6.99 deal. I was a bit disappointed. I don't remember the mediums size pizza being that small, I don't know if those are the size of the \" 6.99 pizza special\", but remember ordering the pizza from \"the hut\" not to long ago and didn't remember them being that small. I guess I'll just stick to my Rosaties , Venenzias (sp?) and Barro's pizza! Seem to get my money's worth on there \"non specials\" pizza's..... Pizza is still good at Pizza Hut, but just very unsatisfied with the size of the pizza's!"}
{"text":"Best pizza hut pizza i ever had till now .Big Thanks to chef and management . Really liked it and will visit again."}
{"text":"I ordered 2 pizzas and garlic knots at 4:50pm. It said the food would take about 65-75 mins. The food didn't arrive until 6:30 pm, but we weren't too mad bc we figured they were busy because it was a Friday night. As the delivery driver was pulling the food out, he dropped our garlic knots on the ground and marinara sauce spilled all over our front porch which I ended up having to clean up. The driver said he would go back and bring us more. I live less than 10 mins from the store so I didn't think it would take too long. After an hour of waiting, I called the store and the girl that answered said there wasn't anything she could do and all of the delivery drivers were making deliveries so there was no way for her to tell me if he was actually coming back or not. After another hour of waiting, I called back to get a refund and spoke with the manager (at this point it was 8:30pm). The only way I could get a refund would be to physically go to the store and have them swipe my card which is ridiculous. He was able to credit me the money back for my next order but unfortunately I won't be ordering from Pizza Hut again."}
{"text":"Ordered for delivery. Email confirmation said it would be at my house in 30 minutes.  After an hour of no pizza and no phone call I finally called them. (the woman who answered the phone was a huge B***h. She had mega attitude. If you are so miserable working at pizza hut go back to high school and get your diploma.)  Only to find out my order had never been started.  I then I had to place my order again because it was \"lost\".  After another hour of waiting I finally got my cold pizza.  Later I discovered I had been charged twice for the first and second time I had to place my order.  

I will not ever order from this pizza hut again."}
{"text":"36th street Thomas, on the North/East corner. Completely remodeled. I did not go inside but they have a drive thru for pickup, nice! I could see through the windows it looks very nice inside."}
{"text":"The only reason I am rating this so high is the fact they have such quick delivery service. I am from Chicago so the pizza is just ok. Counter people and delivery drivers are always super pleasant."}
{"text":"Would give it no stars if it would let me ! Ordered from them only because they were open and delivered after 10pm.  Should have taken the other reviews to heart as I had a similar experience!
Ordered about 10pm - waited an hour .... no pizza, no call. Called the store ... No answer... Out of the blue about 1115 they call - can't find me - what hotel? They said it's on the way...Nearly 30 minutes later it finally arrives .... Cold, and not exactly what  I had ordered ! Ate it anyway - nothing else open and no transportation....Got sick as hell a few hours later in the middle of the night!  Don't patronize this place...You've been warned!"}
{"text":"Stopped by for a quick pick up. First time at this location. Must say Alicia provided excellent service, reviewed specials and made my special order since I like my pizza well done. I didn't want to wait to long since I was next door at FexEx but Alicia was so sweet and informative I did. It's a small location for pick up. The strip mall can use additional parking space. I suggest ordering ahead of time, unless your like me who decided at the last minute you want pizza."}
{"text":"This location is so effin horrible. First, the lady took our order took effin forever!!! Why are you still in effin business? We were waiting for a pickup and no one checked up on us at all. We heard screaming and effin around at the back. They must close this location right now!!! You don't even deserve a one-star you bunch of lazy, irresponsible, inconsiderate a-holes!"}
{"text":"Only can review on the wings which are amazing! Boneless with honey bbq are the best, made to order on time and friendly staff."}
{"text":"Greasy and burnt. Pizza way too greasy and mushroom are burnt. I waited over 30 mins for  digusting pizza. Quality of pizza are getting worse. I remember eating pizzahut down mississauga was so much better. This is my 3rd time here and service is always slow and they dont even seem busy. You can get better pizza for less at other chains. This place will be a disappointment. Avoid."}
{"text":"Went there for lunch buffet, what a disappointment. For 5.99 you get pizza breadsticks and pasta. They will give you one small bowl of salad for an additional 99 cents ( what a deal ) I guess if you've lived in Phoenix your whole life then this is what you expect from their buffet. The pizza hut buffets we are used to for 5.99 include pizza, breadsticks, salad bar which includes salad, cold pastas, fruits,deserts and pretty much what you'd find on most salad bars plus 2 hot soups. All this for the EXACT same price! Wow.. Guess if we ever get a craving for pizza hut buffet we will wait until we go back to IL. to visit because it's a scam here."}
{"text":"They didn't have an option for zero stars.

I want to make it perfectly clear that I have gone through the trouble of creating a Yelp account to say how much this place sucks.

I did an online order only to find out that after I did it, I forgot that it was supposed to be white sauce, not marinara sauce. Oopsie.

I called the Pizza Hut not even two minutes later to make the change, however the manager Tim refused to make the change, saying that it was already made and in the oven. This was roughly two minutes after I sent the order online. His response was essentially this: you ordered it, I'm not touching it, and it's your fault. I think at that point he may have opened his shirt and started to rub his nipples in glee over all this as the cable company in \"South Park\" does.

He handed the phone back to the REALLY nice girl who took my call in the beginning who apoligized to me. I asked if he refuses to change it, would I have to wait for the pizza to arrive, say it was wrong, send it back and remake it. She didn't say no, but she didn't say yes either. The delivery guy arrived and I told him the situation. He called the restaurant and let them know that I was \"the guy\" they talked about and Tim got on the phone. I said that the pizza was wrong, but once again he just flat out refused to remake it.

I gave them money, asked for something to be changed, and they refused. The cost of making a pizza on hand tossed, then frozen dough is not a lot, believe it or not. 

Thanks for the customer service, Tim. I'm making this Yelp review and calling all levels of management (regional, corporate, etc) above you because of your demeanor."}
{"text":"Standard Pizza Hut. The deep dish pizza was great. No seating. Great for take-out."}
{"text":"Last night, I was craving pizza so my boyfriend and I ordered from this Pizza Hut. We ordered a medium hand tossed cheese pizza, 2 personal pan pizzas with pepperoni, and an order of QuePapas. We ended up extremely disappointed and generally unsatisfied by our meal.

The QuePapas did not arrive at all. We were told that the store was busy and it could be up to 45 minutes for them to come, separately, so we should just call and request a refund. All three of the pizzas were cool (not hot or even warm), and the crust for all of them tasted old/stale. There was barely any sauce on the medium pizza and the crust under the toppings was thin and chewy, like cardboard.

My boyfriend doesn't care for Pizza Hut, but he will eat there for the QuePapas, and because I like the pizza, but we will be unable to order from here, again, as we cannot expect a level of pride in the preparation of our food, or detail in the manner of delivery."}
{"text":"Super skimpy on toppings. We ordered three stuffed crust pizzas. A large hawaiian that came with maybe five of the smallest pieces of ham (basically was a pineapple pizza). Also ordered a large canadian and a large supreme which both barely had any meat on them. So tasted like a plain cheese pizza and a plain cheese with green peppers pizza instead of what they should have been.

Total was $90, for the size and skimpyness of the three large pizzas and 2 tiny garlic breads ($6 before cheese add-on), wasnt worth it at all.

But nice delivery guy and it also took less time than the estimate given."}
{"text":"Worst pizza, i order chicken lovers pizza and all i got was onion and hardly you see chicken pieces. paid 20 dollars for medium size and not worth even for 5 dollars. Cheap cheap, wonder why people order food from them."}
{"text":"Overall it was a good experience delivery time was under the estimated time. And they always get my order correct."}
{"text":"Pizza sounded good after our driving around so we decided to eat here.  It was a nice, updated Pizza hut with the stone facade all around.  Bathrooms were decent ( You have to get a key to use it).  My only problem was the only server was attending to a birthday party and it took some time to get drink, food order, and served food.  She did however apologize for the wait and thanked us for our patience so it made the wait much more tolerable.  It was your standard Pizza Hut food which is what we were looking for."}
{"text":"i always eat at pizza hut but this was not a good location me and my friends got pizza chicken and cheese stiicks and one of them got really sick and whats makes this even worse we came back to complain and we saw a roach that was it for me i would never come to this location ever again i have no idea how they got a safety award for 2013 must have been a mistake stay away from this pizza hut location."}
{"text":"Made my order online waited almost 30 minutes more from the expected delivery time. Called lady on the phone really nice said the food was already out for delivery. Finally 45 minutes after the estimated time I get my food, not happy food was cold the pizza was missing ingredients."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery and they said they would be about 30-40minutes. Next thing you know in 20 minutes I hear a knock on my door and it's the pizza delivery man! Super fast delivery and I live at yonge/sheppard. We got the stuffed crust pizza and it tasted great and it was still warm! So Awesome!"}
{"text":"Service was horrible!!! The waiter was rude and gave us an attitude when we kindly asked for a refill and when she came with the water, it was filled all the way to the top to the point it spilled all over our pizza when she sat the water down!! Not to mention, our order was wrong!"}
{"text":"The one star should be negative. First of all, we ordered and requested the wings well done and extra crispy. They were just normal, not crispy. We showed up for carry out 8 minutes before the order was supposed to be ready. One member of our party added brownies to the order because they said it would only take 5 minutes. It ended up taking 15. By the time the brownies were done the pizza was dried out. I told the manager ASHTON about all of these issues  and he said \"there really is nothing I can do for you because you're having an attitude\". How is telling him the food is not cooked correctly giving him an attitude? He told me the owners name is Ken Howe so I hope Ken sees this and does something to correct this awful service. Ashton did NOT follow the policy of remaking the order, remaking it later, or giving a refund. Ashton also stated at different times in the conversation they cooked them for 12, then 15, then it became 20. He is a liar and a joke of a manager. He also looked like he was high on something because his eyes were red, slanted and his speech was slow and incoherent at times. UPDATE: we ordered 16 wings and only got 14. WORST PIZZA HUT ever, and I think it is all due to the person who told us he was the \"general manager\", Ashton!"}
{"text":"Ugh. Just ugh.  I think I'm done with Pizza Hut for a while thanks to this location.  

Ordered a pan crust.  I wasn't thrilled with the 1.25 hour delivery time, but I figured it was a Friday night, so...not a huge deal.

The problem was when the food finally arrived.  First off, it was the flattest pan pizza I'd ever seen, which was unfortunately predictive of the quality overall.  Second, as soon as I chewed my first bite, my tongue was coated with uncooked dough.  Pan pizzas are described as \"soft and chewy on the inside,\" not wet, gooey, and totally disgusting.  This was a huge waste of money.  If you like pan pizzas and want something similar that isnt awful, hit up Romeos in Twinsburg."}
{"text":"Absolutely the worst pizzas I have ever ordered in my life it was totally A crappy pizza it was like eating a bad McDonald's double cheeseburger that was a day-old the crust was ridiculously hard to cheese has to be the cheapest cheese on the market. Took almost an hour to deliver and the pizza was cold that will be the first and last time."}
{"text":"So disappointed in Pizza Hut. I ordered for delivery at 8pm, and should have had it delivered by 8:35. At 9:25 I called because still no pizza. I was told that they ran out of dough and canceled my order! How does a pizza place run out of dough???? When I asked why no one had picked up a phone to call, they said they were just about to call you. I work in customer service, we were about to call you is code for oh shit we dropped the ball. This is the second time I've had issues with this same place. No more chances. I will be taking my business and my $$$ somewhere else."}
{"text":"Absolutely the worst delivery pizza and cheese sticks I've ever received.  I only went with Pizza Hut for their $11 any toppings online deal.  I decided to give Pizza Hut one more chance before I wrote them off completely after receiving a cold pizza before, but I will not be making that mistake again.  The pizza was barely warm and the dough wasn't cooked through.  With each bite we could taste raw dough.  Only two slices were eaten before deciding we wouldn't eat anymore of it.  The cheese sticks weren't cheesy at all, and were cold.  We had to heat them up in the toaster oven before eating them.  What a waste of $22.  I'll be ordering Papa John's or Domino's the next time I decide to get delivery."}
{"text":"Worst service ever!!!!! Made me wait almost 2 hours for my pizza!!! I asked the guy about how much longer for my pizza and he said 25-35 minutes.
I'll never come here again!"}
{"text":"When we ordered our pizza they told us it would be delivered within 1hr after 2 hrs we called and they said they cancelled our order because they ran out of hand tossed, so we then ordered thin for pickup and went to pick it up. At which point when we went to enter the building they told us they were closing early and we wouldn't receive our pizza and we would be refused. May I add when we arrived there was an employee with about 5 pizzas dancing in front of her car because she was going home with free pizza. Just unexceptionable and very poor costumer service and management. I will never go to this Pizza Hut ever again."}
{"text":"First and last time ordering from here.  Place order at 5:00 and received it at 6:14 and place is literally less than 3 miles.  So ready to eat and open boxes 1 pie burnt, breadsticks burnt and pizza poorly made.  I'm going back to Tony's best pizza all around."}
{"text":"I  was in Las Vegas for a business trip and needed a pick me up and had the BEST pizza I've EVER had in my ENTIRE life. It was SO good that I had to recognize the person who made it... So THANK YOU Adam! You seriously made my crappy day better! Thanks Adam for being so friendly and helping turn my day around! :-)"}
{"text":"Whoever is the owner of this franchised Pizza Hut should just simply close down. Their service is a joke! In my experience with ordering delivery with most establishments, online ordering is cheaper and faster. However, I ordered 2 pizzas online at this Pizza Hut on Milton road at 7:45 pm and it's now 10:15 and we're still waiting on our delivery. I've called twice and was told the 1st time I called that they're sorry but they only have 2 drivers. The 2nd time I called they said they only have 1 driver and that it would only be 15 more minutes. It's now 10:18 and we're still waiting. 

Fast-forward to 2015:  I started writing that review last year and ended up never finishing this review. I think the pizza finally arrived while I was writing. Anyway to continue and finish, I have since moved from that neighborhood and no longer have to deal with that type of service. But to others, beware. It is a poor excuse for a Pizza Hut and in serious need of new management. If they have changed and gotten better, then good for them. But I doubt it. Establishments that are close enough to \"the hood\" tend to have horrible customer service and poor quality product."}
{"text":"On two occasions I specified extra sauce ($1.00 additional charge). To my disappointment there was no extra sauce. Why do they charge for this when other pizza chains offer this option for free. Pizza Nova's tomato sauce is damn good and you don't see them charging extra. Stick to their pan crust,  and ditch the thin crust. The thin crust was horrible. It tasted like cardboard. This place is a disappointment."}
{"text":"Service was super slow, pretty poorly run in-house. I dunno about their delivery, I don't like Pizza Hut pizza, so I usually get wings carry out. I wish there was something nicer nearby where I live but the truth is it's just convenient. I would never come here otherwise."}
{"text":"Worst possible food and service ever.  They can't follow simple instructions like lite sauce or crust toppers or even the right toppings. I f yuo go to pick up you have to put up with unprofessional staff that clearly don't want to be there. If you don't want a crappy minimum wage then being horrible at it isn't going to help."}
{"text":"I love Pizza Hut but this one is really horribly run. They're \"okay\" if you do carry-out but delivery is a joke. I've now ordered from them twice, the second time giving them the benefit of the doubt that they were having a rough night the first time. Apparently they weren't. 3 hour wait the first time, and the second time going on two hours. Called in to see what was going on and the best they could give me was \"it should be there soon.\" An hour later and it still wasn't there. Shame on me for giving them a second chance and looks like I wasn't the only one. So irritating."}
{"text":"quick fast service. good pizza. workers are nice and friendly. this place is for TAKE OUT and DELIVERY ONLY."}
{"text":"Delivery was late, terrible service, and we payed $2.99 for garlic bread that ended up being ONLY 2 PIECES!!"}
{"text":"By far this is the worst pizza Hut location I had ever been. I went over there with my wife. 
To begin with our waiter kept us waiting for more than 15 minutes just to take the order. After we ordered we waited more than 45 minutes to get our pizza. When we got our pizza it was cold. We called the waiter to explain all the situation and then the manager came and apologized for the whole situation. We didn't see any reason why our pizza took so long to be served as we where the only ones in the restaurant. 
I don't recommend this location, very bad customer service"}
{"text":"Stayed in today, and decided on pizza.  After checking a few, I chose Pizza Hut for delivery. Order on line, and got the pizza in the time they said. It was hot and prepared nicely. The delivery driver was very nice. Will do this again. Thanks to the crew that made my lunch happen."}
{"text":"Had a large order today of pizza, chicken and bread sticks. The staff did a really good job in getting it done on time. Food was great!"}
{"text":"They deliver to us and today I'm doing take out. It's good :) always is. Try the white pizza!! My fav."}
{"text":"Horrible dine in experience. No body came at the table to take orders. Took us more than 40 mins to be attended. Avoid this place"}
{"text":"If I could give them ZERO stars, I would.

I online ordered a small pizza and boneless wings at 11:30am over this past summer.
I received email confirmation that my order would arrive in 1 hour.  About 1.5 hours went by, and I heard nothing.  When I tried calling, someone kept picking-up the phone and hanging up on me (over and over and over again).
Finally, around 1:45pm some kid delivery driver called me and said he was lost.
I told him exactly where I lived (cross streets and all).
(The location of this Pizza Hut is a 5 minute drive from me)
He finally showed up around 3pm.  He stunk of weed and his eyes were extremely bloodshot.  The food was cold.

I will never order from here again.

Also, last week a co-worker ordered from them, and it took them 2 hours to show up.
They also kept hanging up on her when she called to check on her order."}
{"text":"Normally we love pizza hut and their stuffed crust pizza, this time will probably be the last time we order pizza from them. We chose to do a staycation with our family at a hotel and decided to order pizza. It was 1030 when we placed the order so I know it was late, but they close at 12 and it was a friday night so I figured we would still get quality pizza. The pizza arrived on time, however when we sat down to eat it the pizza was squished in the box. Wasn't fully cut, and wasn't fully cooked. The middle of the pizza was raw, their was an off taste to the cheese. The breadsticks we ordered were burned though. Not sure how those two were complete opposites. The pepsi however was cold. When I went to call the store no one answered the phone. This was at about 1130.... the store should have still been open for another 30 minutes. Very disappointed and will not be ordering again."}
{"text":"Food wasn't bad, but it was difficult to enjoy because all of the furniture was sticky. Needs a good cleaning for sure!   Bathroom was  too."}
{"text":"I ordered two pizzas and three things of wings. Wings were fine but my pizza's both had large bald spots without almost no sauce and absolutely no cheese at all. Pizza should be checked before  they go in the oven and after when it get cut. On a side note my pizza wasn't even cut all the way, I had to grab my own pizza cutter and do it that way.
I will be finding other pizza options."}
{"text":"Great customer service didn't catch the girls name working the front counter but she went above and beyond! Will be back! Visit at 4/23 around 650p"}
{"text":"Placed an order with a gift card about 5:40p today (saturday) for some hot wings and a p'zone.  Was quoted a little over an hour delivery time.  Got my order within 25 minutes, food was hot and really good.  I'll be ordering again, very happy.  Didnt get 5 stars because I don't hand those out like candy."}
{"text":"Picked up our pizzas, sat down to eat dinner to find the crust on our pizzas was almost completely raw. Doesn't make sense since we had to wait several minutes for them to finish after arriving a couple min late. Now we have to wait even longer to eat because we need to bake our pizzas so they are edible. I think I'll drive to to Kings Dr. Location. Went there for years and had great quality every time."}
{"text":"The ONLY reason I order from this particular Pizza Hut is because it's the one who delivers to us and my younger son is so daggone picky that he will only eat Pizza Hut and Papa Johns and I don't like Papa Johns. 

I rarely call in because even under normal circumstances, it's just easier to do things online and plus, the introvert that I am, I really don't like dealing with a whole lot of people because my temper can't stand other folks attitudes..I have no patience for it (oxymoron right?). When I do call in, the people are polite enough and sometimes, I do get nice enough people who seem to actually care. But the last time I called about my order, I don't remember all of her response but I do remember her telling me \"there is nothing she can do about the wait\" etc...basically, an \"I don't care\" type of attitude (that end up taking 3 hours to get to me...then by the time it got here, they left off my wings, that they did bring and still forgot the blue cheese..which, is strange that all they carry for wings is blue cheese and not ranch but it is what it is I guess).....

Now, mind you, I am not quick to complaing about customer service because as someone who worked in customer service for some years...I understand what it is to work with customers, especially the nasty ones who think that they can talk to you any old kind of way and that the customer is always right(let me stop here and say, as an employee AND a customer...No the hell you're not always right! Especially when you are mistreating people! Then want to get in your feelings when people mistreat you! hmph!)....

I digress....

I try not to complain too much because I know how hectic and stressful dealing with the public can be (especially the above mentioned)...so I try to be understanding but sometimes, that understanding has to shut off and I complain, well this time I did. When I emailed Pizza Hut, they sent us coupons. Whether they made any comments to them or not, I don't know. I have been in Charlotte for almost 29 years and that is the pizza hut we always went to for a long time and they used to be really nice (this was during the time Walmart was in the parking lot and a somewhat nice one and also, a lot of other popular stores were there and it was always busy . Things change....drastically...

I have had issues before with Pizza Hut (this one) where I have made orders with them, charged card and I didn't get my order for whatever reason. I don't remember the exact details of the situation but I know I was pissed and stopped dealing with them for about a year at least until my son just started complaining about wanting to go back to them. I still get nervous every time I order from them that something is going to screw up. And sometimes, they still do. One example, they tend to not always have drivers or only have one. And I have had to wait 2+ hours to get the pizza. I will wait many times because I am generally extremely tired and/or not feeling well. 

I agree with the other posts on here and think they need to get it together. Seriously."}
{"text":"For real? My latest experience with this Pizza Hut was almost something to laugh at. 

My boyfriend and I called at around 9:20 for delivery on a Wednesday night. The girl answered the phone, and we stated that this was for delivery. Her first response was that \"we're on an hour and a half wait for delivery orders.\" Really? A primarily delivery-based pizza place is an hour and a half on deliveries? What in the world...? 

Anyhow, we changed our minds and stated that it was for pickup. We decided to order one of the specially advertised $8.99 dinner boxes, but she immediately responded that they were out of the boxes. Ok, really? For a nationally recognized chain to be out of an advertised special is a little ridiculous. 

So, thinking that third time would be a charm, we tried to order the cheese lovers pizza (or whatever it's called) and a side of cinnamon sticks. Needless to say, we were turned down again because apparently they are out of \"all rectangular dough\" meaning the rectangular slices to make the garlic toast and the cinnamon sticks. 

Pizza hut has a mere 4 different things on the menu (excluding variations). HOW ON EARTH CAN YOU BE OUT OF 3/4?! After going nowhere for five minutes, we decided to tell the girl to forget about our order and that we'd consider elsewhere. Just a note to this particular franchise owner, stock enough product and hire enough employees to keep up with demands."}
{"text":"I just moved in next door. Didn't want to cook and was craving pizza. Walked in to make a take out order and they told me they have no dough. I was told the dough will be ready in approx. 20 minutes. They also told me that there were about 13-15 orders waiting for dough as well, therefore it will be a long wait.

Come on... what pizza place runs out of dough? Didn't end up ordering, but I love Pizza Hut. I will be back for a food review."}
{"text":"To bad-so sad---there internet isn't working so if you don't come with cash... your out of luck...
They tell you to go to an ATM then come back and order. I asked are they doing anything for the inconvenience, the young man said he would ask his supervisor and she said NO...I said thank you and called Little Ceasars..."}
{"text":"This Pizza Hut is consistent and good! Fast delivery and always comes hot and fresh! Thank you guys!"}
{"text":"We used this store for carry-out for the first time tonight and had great service. We ordered our pizza and wings online and when I went to pickup, I waited a few short minutes before they brought it out to me. Wings and pizza were delicious, and we are very happy with this store. We will be back!"}
{"text":"This place sucks. Ordered a pizza BEFORE they were closed, got an email confirmation and everything, they never showed up. Never called. BUT THEY MADE SURE TO CHARGE ME!"}
{"text":"There app for Android sucks! 

Even when I had a coupon for a free pizza because of a problem, they still screw up! Get a clue, fix it!

 We paid less for a sit down dinner with full service."}

{"text":"Recently just racked up enough \"HUT\" points from getting pizzas delivered and what not; we all know that there's a 10$ minimum fee to even get the order delivered to you; which is perfectly fine, but what's not cool is after being a valued customer; giving \"Pizza Hut\" business consistently, and gaining enough points to get a \"free\" pizza you still have to order other things to get that minimum fee up to 10$...YAY; \"FREE PIZZA\"... Anywho, so I call the store regarding the issue I had online, and he doesn't come up with any alternative as to ways he can work around the issue I'm having;\"He doesn't have nothing to do with the online ordering, ok cool; but what you can do is take my order over the phone, and get the pizza delivered to me that way; and easily open my account, with my permission of course to say I \"walked in\" and got the free pizza; that way my \"HUT\" points will be deducted, as if I used them online. Anywho; is what it is, pizza is great; love Pizza Hut; just wish that there wasn't only one way to get your \"free pizza\"; who's to say that; the person ordering has a disability or doesn't own a car... that's not cool; why even earn points."}
{"text":"Absolutely horrendous. The first time I ordered from here, I got a build your own pizza. Half supreme, half meat lovers. Ignorantly, when it was delivered i trusted it was the right order. I opened the box, and it was a plain cheese pizza. I called and told them I was sent the wrong order, innocent mistake... right? I get it. They said they'd send the right pizza out. Then two minutes later i got a call back from them and they said that I ordered this cheese pizza and they'd have to charge extra for the toppings.... except, I didn't order a cheese pizza!!! I paid $25 in cash to the delivery driver... we asked for our money back instead. 
But that's not all! I'm forgiving, i believe everyone deserves a second chance. So tonight I ordered my pizza, same thing, half supreme half meat lovers. They got it right!!! I'm pretty stoked about the pizza, right? So I open it up and grab a hot fresh slice, and it falls apart in my hands... i mean, really falls apart, everywhere. The dough is undercooked and goop is all over the place. The veggies are shit, the crust is even goopy.... I am livid. Luckily, the shit was 50% off... instead of calling and dealing with a bunch of children who's parents failed to instill pride in good work and integrity in knowing you did what was right (you can't tell me you asshats didn't give them instructions), I'm just going to throw away this bullshit pizza dough and uncooked veggies and leave this review. Two stars on this terrible place is a lie, one star is a damn stretch. Please heed to my advice and DO NOT ORDER FROM HERE!!!!! 
Managers, you should be ashamed of your staff... owner of the chain, why are you hiring managers that clearly do not care about the image of your company."}
{"text":"Since my original review we have hesitantly ordered from this location a FEW more times. Long story short, please don't waste your time because they don't like to \"waste their time\" on you."}
{"text":"I believe this location to be one of the best, if not the best. I always do carry out and they have it ready when they say unless I order online - it starts a 15 min. timer and sometimes when they are busy, I end up waiting a few minutes. The staff is always friendly. The food is always exceptional. They will even honor coupons over the phone if the online ordering states \"this store does not except that coupon\"."}
{"text":"This place used to be good but last few times I've been there the service has gotten really sloppy!!! And so has the food!!!! Management needs to do better, cause who ever is running this Pizza Hut is doing a very bad job!!!!!!  Won't  b going here anymore until I hear or c otherwise."}
{"text":"I was thoroughly impressed with the employee I believe to be named Hagar. He was extremely nice and helpful. Very few business have employees like him... Very professional and everyone with me felt the same way. Thanks Hagar!"}
{"text":"This location is wonderful. The food is prepared perfectly and the employees treat you like family. Hands down best Pizza Hut!"}
{"text":"Gross is an understatement. Greasy pizza. No meat on several slices. I will not be back."}
{"text":"Hadn't ordered Pizza Hut in a long time thought I would give it a try again because it was close and I had three teenagers to feed. Ordered online and waited extra time to pick up because this location has never had any pizza I ordered ready on time. Arrived and my order was ready but incorrect. Plus found out that even if you order two orders of wings they charge you 50 cents for each ranch. They don't give one or two anymore. Everywhere else does. Guess this is how they have to recoup money plus some for all the $10 pizzas. 

My options for the incorrect order: wait 10 minutes for another correct pizza while the rest of my order sits or 2) a credit for next time. Considering I was reluctant to order to begin with plus had to pay for ranch I opted for neither. I can get a $10 pizza from Oggies thanks to yelp. Better pizza, same price, and I don't pay for ranch. 

In business little things become big things in regards to customer perception and \"sorry I don't make the rules\" even in an apologetic and innocent wish i could help way, doesn't make me a repeat customer."}
{"text":"I order today at 1:07 for 2 medium pizzas and they said it will take 45 mins. I like 7 mins away. They ended ringing on my door bell at 1:20. Thank god I have so many kids in this house they were getting hungry."}
{"text":"3 stars for the time in which this was delivered. Right on time 30mins. The pizzas were just warm and overall PizzaHut pizzas lost their taste.  Very bland and unappetizing."}
{"text":"Pizza is life. 

We never used to order from Pizza Hut but they recently got a lot better. Their hand tossed pizza is amazing & the Wing Street + Hershey's collaboration... Genius. 

We are so guilty of ordering here more often than we should but man, it's always so good! 

Pizza is fresh. They always show up on time, or earlier. The company itself always sends good coupons & we never have a problem redeeming them. 

Most recently, I ordered Pizza for my fiancé who was studying hard. I asked them to write a note for me, if possible & they really went above & beyond! They drew a whole picture on the box!!! 

The customer service & amazing food is gonna keep this location going. Very pleased."}
{"text":"Website ordering is cool. You put in your credit card. Delivery person brings receipt for you to sign.  No imprint needed.  COOL.

Yes to the wings.  Website ordering allows you to add free drizzle on your pizza.  Yum."}
{"text":"If I could give a 0 that's what this place would get. I ordered a large pizza, chicken wings and cheese sticks. The pizza was raw in the middle!!! The order took 1 hr 15 min to arrive. I will never order from this place again. Go to the one on Nellis & Stewart instead."}
{"text":"Pizza's order at 7:30, phone call made @ 8:30, to say \"hey, where are my pizza's?\" I was told some lie about only having one driver, but my pizza's were on the counter and up for the next delivery.

Really?!?!? This is not the first disappointing experience with Pizza Hut @ Lake Mead and Hollywood, but it is the last. We will never order pizza from this location, again. Terrible customer service, they clearly have no clue how to run a business.

Today I went in and Rosalinda helped me and completed gave me attitude when I told her that the debit was my dads and that I had my ID with the same last name. I hate going to places when not everyone is on the same page. Manage your team correctly. I will never go back to this place"}

Manager has an attitude, saying the instructions didn't come in, not my problem if is doesn't work why have the service. Driver to lazy to walk to the front desk only can use the phone to call. Her excuse is that we don't waste the drivers time and gas. Will never order from here again"}

{"text":"Guys.  GUYS.  It is never EVER the customer's problem that you can't staff your store adequately.

A 3 hour wait? Never ok.  

Giving customers attitude when they decide to cancel their order and take their business elsewhere? NEVER OK.

Get a handle on your ish, guys.  Seriously."}
{"text":"Apparently, these fucktards can't use a phone. If your cellular phone number is, say, Indian Springs, where they'd have to dial the area code, they can't figure that out. So, they go ahead and cancel your order without communicating with you. 

I will never, ever, ever, ever use this Pizza Hut again.

And why did they need my number? To call and confirm my order. 

HERE'S A TIP, DIPSHIT: If the order is already paid for, and I placed it over the Internet, it's because I don't want to TALK to you slack-jawed Taco-Bell rejects. If I was looking forward to a phone conversation with a pizza place, I'd have called in my order. I would have gotten a GOOD pizza from a local place. I wanted to order over the Internet to AVOID talking to you. 

So, fuck this place. You've lost my business forever."}
{"text":"They get one stars because they keep hiring these rude, untrained, unprofessional, employees. I refuse to order from this one again,even though it is literally right by my house. It's cool I will take my money to dominoes where they won't constantly argue with the customer. Or they won't bang on the door like the police and refuse to announce who they are, I mean do they not train their staff on professionalism? Knowing the slogan the customer is always right, and the manager David sounds like a robot and needs more classes! They need to get their lives together, no one wants to deal with this mess at all."}
{"text":"How is it that they always run out of parmesan cheese and red peppers? Seriously they should always have that in stock. Or maybe the delivery driver just lied to me about not having any so he wouldnt have to go get it from his car."}
{"text":"This is a carry-out only location and they always seem to be away from the counter... I'm not saying they take forever away from the counter but for a tiny place I'm always wondering where they could be... anyways, the staff has always been friendly during my pickups. The previous review is correct in that they don't take anything over a $20; I think part of that is that they are not in the best area... I use a debit card so that doesn't matter to me at all. The new pastas they have here are very good so give them a try."}
{"text":"The last few times ive ordered its been really good. Sometimes they cut the pizza wonky,  but overall pizzas always get here hot and fresh, wings are always on point."}
{"text":"If I could give them something lower than 1 star I would. Absolutly a horrible experience! I don't like dealing with stand people coming to my house so I place my order online & pick it up myself. Well right was really bad service. Just to give an example for those who don't know, once you place your order a count down time starts for 15 minutes. My order was placed at 6:12pm, when I got to the store they had me pay right away with a time stamp of 6:32. I didn't get into my car with my order till 6:56pm. I ordered 3 pizzas & a cookie. They kept telling me 20 minutes after my order was supposed to be ready, \"we are just saying in the cookie.\" No apologies, not even a care in the works that they were running really behind not only on my order but others as well. When I got there the board to list everybody's order even stated that my order was ready. I think this dyad really needs to be retained & learn that a job is something that you have respect for & appreciate because it puts food on your table. If you are going to work in a field that deals with customer service, pretend you care, even if you haste your job!!! GET IT TOGETHER!!!"}
{"text":"Just came from here. The entire experience was shockingly bad.

Before I went I called to check how late their dining room was open. Was greeted \"HithankyouforcallingPizzaHutpleasehold\" in pretty much one word. I wait for about 4 minutes. Someone picks up again and it's \"HithankyouforcallingPizzaHutpleasehold\" before I can explain I've already been put on hold and have a simple question. I checked my phone and I had been on hold for 9 minutes before someone was actually able to speak with me. I should've taken that as a red flag and stayed clear.

We arrive and stand at the empty hostess desk for just under 5 minutes before we're greeted by anyone. The restaurant seems very busy with everyone running around stressed. We're told we have to wait for them to clear a table which is fine. We wait just over 5 minutes when they take us to the one empty table that isn't full of crap from the last guests. Literally every other table desperately needed to be bussed. This was a table I'd seen from the door that was empty the whole time. And they did not replenish it with side plates or cutlery, until we had to ask later when we received our appetizer.

After ordering, it took WAY too long for us to get our pizza. I was starting to get impatient when the waitress comes over and tells us it'll be 5-10 minutes more. It had already been at least 25min since ordering. I timed it from the point she gave us this 5-10 minute warning and it was an additional 14min until we finally got our pizza. 

Oh and a dine-in medium pizza isn't the same as a normal medium pizza for some reason. It's more expensive, smaller, and square slices for some unknown reason. 

Server didn't check on us for about 10 minutes when we needed to ask for drink refills (she took our old ones which still had a few sips less and then we had to wait until she brought us new ones. Hardly a big faux pas compared to how terrible they were at everything else but still not at all proper serving standards)

Literally every step and every aspect of our dining experience was absolutely terrible. I don't expect much at a Pizza Hut but the way this place is run is actually remarkable."}
{"text":"After an exciting evening celebrating my granddaughter's graduation about 10:30 pm in evening on June 4, 2013 I decided to take my granddaughter and a friend to get something to eat. The choice was Pizza Hut that happen to be around the corner from where my granddaughter lives. We ordered 4 wing orders and a couple of drinks, the total was $35.00 in which I thought was a little high for wings but it wasn't that important. The young lady taking my order was Laura Pierson. I gave her my debit card and for some reason the card didn't take and was declined, instead of her calling me to the counter and telling me in some sort of private, discrete way, Laura announced out loud that my card was declined, using my smart phone i pulled up my bank account and showed Laura the numbers in my account and asked her to run it again. Laura ran my card again and the charges was excepted. When I told Laura before announcing to the entire resturant that my card was declined she should of ran it a second time. Instead of her trying to satisfy the embarrassing situation she proceeded to be rude. At this point I became worried about what Laura might do to my food after my complaining about the announcement of my declined card, so their was another employee I think was named Amber or Amy, she was very nice and asked her to please watch my food. In worrying about what Laura might do to my food made my entire experience stressful, upon receiving my order could not enjoy my meal worrying about what might have been done to my meal. After that experience I would not recommend  Pizza Hut to any of my friends ever."}
{"text":"Worst Pizza I have ever had. Ordered 2 of the triple threats at 5:50 pm for delivery. We waited over an hour for the delivery to arrive and when it arrived the pizza was completely overcooked. The breadsticks were overcooked and hard and finally the smores cookie we ordered was hard as a rock. I called and spoke to the Manager and explained that when I spend $50 for dinner I expect the food to be edible - and it really wasn't. I will not be ordering from Pizza Hut in the future. Be very careful!"}
{"text":"The pizza and service has really gone down hill. Seems like they don't care about quality and only think about the quantity they can sell. When you call to tell them there was something wrong with the order they become rude."}
{"text":"If I could only give zero stars. 
First of all, I love Pizza Hut.  This one is close to my house, so we use it. We are consistently disappointed.  Like, every other time. It is so shoddy. And their managers are a joke. We are going to start driving to our old neighborhood because this location is absolutely clueless and have zero customer service skills. It's like it's run by monkeys."}
{"text":"This is the best place to get boneless wings. Online ordering is fast and simple. When I do go in to pick it up Deniece is always smiling and very friendly. Wednesday is the best day to order wings 50cent each."}
{"text":"I figured I would take a break from pizza pizza and go for some stuffed crust. Unfortunately I was extremely disappointed with the quality of my pizza given it was $20. The crust was great, but the slices were extremely thin and dry.

I'm not sure if it was this location or Pizza Hut in general but I certainly won't be returning anytime soon."}
{"text":"Worst Pizza Hut ever I hate it's the closest one to me because I actually like Pizza Hut a lot the store is 6 mins away and I still took over an hour when my window was 25-35 mins I was almost late leaving my house because it took so long"}
{"text":"tldr

I mean, what's more clutch than the $10 dinner box on a Sunday night?
This location prepped the order crazy fast.

Got:
-dinner box (1 topping rectangular pan pizza w/ BBQ drizzle, breadsticks and cinnamon breadsticks): breadsticks were kind of over baked, cinnamon breadsticks are always on point."}
{"text":"Ordered online. Pizza came cold and over cooked. Bread sticks were stale. Sauce for the bread sticks was cold and only half full. We threw most of it away it was so bad."}
{"text":"So when I order my pizza from here I always use delivery and everything is perfect and on time. This is the first time I chose to do carry out because I was shopping near by. I placed my online order (because I didn't want to go in the store and order it then wait, also because I don't want to talk to people and it's just all around convenient) anyway .. placed my order online, got my confirmation and quoted time. They quoted me that pick was available at 7:22pm. Now for me I know how things work so I gave them an extra 20 minutes just to make sure everything with my order is right. Arriving at the store at 7:44pm and my ORDER IS NOT READY FOR PICK UP. We paid (they gave no receipt) and they said it'll just be a little while more. It is currently 8:11pm as I'm typing my review and still no food. Sitting outside the store in our car watching these people laughing and just walking around ... I am very unhappy and will not be ordering pick up from here at all. *Update. Manager spoke to us and said they need to remake my order due to SOMEONE TAKING IT!! Very disappointed."}
{"text":"I don't understand why there's good reviews about this place! The customer service is horrible!! Tonight I ordered online carry out and when I got there no greeting at all what so ever and there was several people behind me. Come on people!! It's not like that location is big and you can't see us walking through the door!! I remember the manager he was prepping food and he told one of his associate frank to get the orders. I told frank my name and it said it was ready on the screen, then he was looking for my order and the manager yelled out to him \" ITS NOT READY!! ITS NOT READY?!! DO YOU NOT UNDERSTAND ME DOES IT LOOK LIKE IM CHINESE!\" And as an CHINESE CUSTOMER you might want to shut your mouth about making those comments!! I know he wouldn't of stop but his associate said something and I saw him glare up at me and just brushed it off like it was nothing!! This is NOT how customers want to be treated!! I will be contacting corporate because we don't need another racist severing us food!!"}
{"text":"Ordered pizza from there on line sight. Arrived to pick it up pizza was just coming out of oven on time. The staff were all very friendly and greated me as soon as i walked in. I also had my daughter with and was carring her. After paying for my pizzas the staff without asking picked up my pizzas and told me they will walk me out with them. They even opened the car door so i could put her in her car seat. They asked if they could put the pizzas on the seat as i was still buckling my daughter. After they sat them down they came around told my daughter good by and opened my car door and told me to drive safe (becouse it was raining) and said to enjoy our pizza and come back again. Very out standing customer service and pizzas were very good made just as ordered."}
{"text":"Always quick with their deliveries! And pizza always come nice and hot and never messes up my order like a few other locations! Thanks for the speedy and reliable consistent service!"}
{"text":"Let me tell you how disgusting this location is when it comes to service. We've ALWAYS had delivery issues with them ranging from the wrong order to excuses that they don't have a delivery driver. Well tonight we've had enough! They got our order wrong so we called to have the order replaced. They said no problem. The delivery driver who says he's also the General Manager (named Jerry) called to let my husband know he was outside. My husband said \"ok thank you\" grabbed the wrong order pizzas to give back to them as requested, goes outside and Jerry the \"General Manager\" drives off as soon as my husband opens the door. My husband calls him confused as to why he drove off, no answer. He calls the store, no answer. So we get in the car to drive there to see what is going on. As we pull up they are locking the doors. \"Jerry\" claims that my husband laughed and said \"F#%k you\" and that is why he drove off. So I asked him where our pizzas were then and he says he put them in the cooler and walks away. MAKES NO SENSE. This is the boiling point of the BS we've been through with Pizza Hut. We called to put in a complaint with corporate and I guarantee you if we don't get a call back from corporate in the 1-3 business days Pizza Hut is going to have a legal issue on their hands."}

{"text":"POOR Service, a Zero Star would be too high of a rating! We were told we could not place an order without providing a phone number, for an order we were picking up in the store, we asked why we'd have to provide a number to order a pizza, then told it's been a policy \"FOREVER\" mandated. An Attitude and HORRID EXAMPLE of Customer Service! All we wanted was something to eat, having picked up my son from school, truth be told i was being REFUSED SERVICE, not trying to be embarrassed, to top things off the last thing we wanted was ATTITUDE!!!!! Mumbling words under his breathe to add insult to injury, completely and utterly RUDE!!!!!! NEVER AGAIN....!!!! Sad because Pizza Hut is a great company to be represented sooooo poorly by a manager named Dan!!!!"}
{"text":"Surprising that this location doesn't have any reviews yet, it's a bit hidden in it's own little small plaza (currently no other business around it) has a decent amount of parking spaces, and it's pretty busy, there is always people inside when I visit.

Because of the lines, it slows down the food production a bit, they answer the phone and make you wait forever to place the order, the website ordering is slow (I found it quickest to place the order on the mobile) 

The wings are pretty good and the individual size personal pizzas are very cheesy. The stuffed pizza or cheesy bites are not cheesy enough."}
{"text":"Spoke to Shaina over the phone carry out. I asked if there were any single order pizza carry out specials. Shaina said no however if I donate $1 to the literacy program she will provide me with a $10 coupon. I asked her if it was for this order or the next one & she said for the next order. She then asked me if I would like to donate more than $1. I offered to donate $5. When I picked up my pizza I was told that there was no coupon for future use & that they gave me a $10 any item special. If I would have known that I would have ordered more then one topping. I explained what I was told over the phone. The lady who I spoke to on the phone as well as the manger & person ringing me up stated that they no longer offer $10 coupons but if I do the survey then I get a $10 coupon emailed to me for future use. This is not what I was told over the phone and I feel it was  way for the restaurant to get money for people to donate. This is unethical. I don't mind donating  but I was lied too so the restaurant can get a donation is not fair. 

My pizza was good but service was not up to par."}
{"text":"I made a to-go-order and went to pick it up. When I first walked into Pizza Hut it had lite smell (it could have been a dirty mop that someone used). It was lite BUT WAS THE FIRST THING I NOTICED WHEN I WALKED IN! The staff was nice I was greeted be at least two employees when I entered. 

THE FOOD:
I ordered 3 pizzas two med and one large. My pizza with the veggies was not cooked fully. Yes it was fresh and hot but it could have stayed in the oven another 5 mins."}
{"text":"Slow service, but the cajun dry rub wings are fabulous! A little pricey though. I'll wait for a coupon for next time. Make sure you check your receipt. If it's not right your food won't be either. Otherwise, this is a decent Pizza Hut."}
{"text":"Dear Pizza Hut,  your dough is just horrible please take a page from Dominos and scrap what you're doing and get back in the game.   Tonight's pizza was just a mess.   Half went to the trash.   And that's only because we were so disgusted that we shared it with a less discriminating friend.  I can't believe I actually like this stuff as a kid.   Was it always this bad?  I'd like to think not,  but seriously, just stop it...jokes over.   I'm giving 2-stars only because the employees seemed to be on point and I had no issue there."}
{"text":"This place sucks! We ordered a medium pepperoni pizza... what'd we get? a medium pepperoni pizza.... barely any sauce and extra EXTRA extra cheese X3. It was loaded with so much cheese, it was disgusting. I never thought I could hate cheese so much. I guess next time i'll have to say \"add sauce... light on the cheese\" (if there is a next time). Just thinking of that pizza makes me gag. ugh."}
{"text":"Terrible service. I called to have a pizza delivered at 9:40pm, it is now 10:26 and we haven't gotten a call nor did we receive our order from this location. Worst service in the world!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"So the pizza came super fast so initially I was impressed UNTIL I realized the stuffed crust was so light that it couldn't be done. I tried it just to confirm the dough was not cooked thoroughly. Disgusting. What a waste of $18. NEVER ordering from this Pizza Hut again!"}
{"text":"Pizza Hut cheese LOVERS is Capital NASTY. Don't order it unless you want something nasty."}
{"text":"Worst tasting pizza in town in a downtrodden Hut, I challenge everyone to stop by just for the laugh. Everything about Pizza Hut \"cira 2013\" is just a joke, with this location being just ridiculous. 

You look up and there's this 1, 2, 3 menu system, no pictures, no common sense, just a butt ugly meaningless board. After starring for a while the 16 year old behind the counter suggested we look at an equally stupid plastic menu. Wow, has it been this long since I have been to a Pizza Hut.  We felt like we stepped into a parallel universe where everything is dumbed down & boring. No beer, no salad bar, no desert, nothing but frozen dough pizza options and self serve soda pop. 

Soylent Green anyone!

We decided to ordered the once familiar Pan Pizza Supreme, what arrived at the table was just nasty. While the toppings tasted vaguely familiar, they where a mere shadow of there former glory.  The crust was beyond nasty, we all stated laughing and poking the thing with a stick. (OK it was our straws but you get the idea) 

The 19 year old store manager finally stopped by to find out what was so funny. I was pounding nails with my crust when she arrived. Got her laughing too, she said while all their crusts arrive frozen, its shouldn't still be rock hard at the table. She offered a refund but we declined laughing our way our the door ... stupid menu, no beer, what were we thinking. 

We re-grouped a block down the road at Flancer's, good beer, good pizza, good times. 

Lesson learned!"}
{"text":"Avoid this place! We've been getting delivery from them for a while. And the last time we've ordered a pizza, we've found a strand of hair net in the pizza, never again!! So gross!!"}
{"text":"Brand New location. I was so excited when I saw that one was opening and I was not unimpressed. We've had a few deliveries to our house already with no mistakes. All the delivery people have been extremely nice and didn't freak out when our fur babies were barking like savage beasts. Our orders were complete with no mistakes and arrived within the time frame they gave, if not earlier. Pizza Hut has so many options now from the different sauces, crusts and toppings. They always have some kind of deals going on, which is awesome. I can stuff myself with a pizza I like and Mike can stuff himself with a pizza he likes. 

It's a Pizza Hut so don't expect it to be a gourmet authentic Italian pizza. Like I said earlier, prompt and friendly delivery with no mistakes. Can't beat that from a Pizza Hut."}
{"text":"ordered on-line Alfredo pizza at 8p and they called to tell me they needed to thaw more out and it would be an hour.  We decided to get the red sauce instead.  After arriving 30 minutes later they claimed out pizza was taken out for a delivery and a new one was in the oven.  waited 10 more minutes.  When we got home the dough was raw.  This is  the 2nd time in 6 months they have messed up our order.  I think domino's can get our business since they seem to get it right."}
{"text":"The last few times I have order a pizza for delivery the pizza has not been done! The order is sent out like 6-7 minutes after ordered online. The toppings and cheese is melted but the dough under is not done AT ALL! I understand fast delivery but I want my pizza cooked and well done!"}
{"text":"After watching ninja turtles, the craving for pizza arose.  This place satisfied that craving - pizza was delicious.  This is a takeout location, but they have a few chairs.  Employees seemed bored though, but it's not a fancy restaurant and as long as the pizza is decent, I'll return."}
{"text":"DO NOT ORDER FROM HERE! If I could give them a no star I would. I haven't ordered from this location in over a year due to their incompetence. I figured I would give it another go. FAIL I ended up calling them after they were 20 mins late and with no information about my address or my order the girl insisted to me all the orders were out for delivery. After an additional 30 mins I called back still no food.  Same girl insisted to me that all orders went out. Well no one would want food that sat in someones car for over 30 mins and the only option I was given was to have my order cancelled. so I took that option and called corporate."}
{"text":"Great spot for lunch. Took my daughter here for the buffet hers was $4.99 and that included the drink mine was $6.99. New pizza was always coming out nothing seemed stale our old. Nice salad bar as well."}
{"text":"Zero stars is not an option.  They said they called us multiple times but they forgot that we don't live in 2014 and can call them on that. I'm not a huge fan of the franchise. But when a girl needs pizza, a girl needs pizza. A late night option is MISSING in Ohio city and Pizza Hut cannot fill that with the delinquents currently in charge."}
{"text":"I decided to have a little get together and have a few family members over. We all decided to order pizza and wings. I placed my order at 9:16pm and around 10:46 we all wondered why our food wasn't here yet. I called to the restaurant and a lady by the name of Sandra answered the phone and stated that she tried to deliver the food and that no one answered the door.  With a house full of people it would be ridiculous that \"no one\" heard someone knock. The woman said that she would call me instead the next time she tried to deliver the food. About a minute after we hung up she calls me right back because her manager told her I would have to re place my order since it was marked undeliverable. I spoke with the manager sierra and she immediately began getting defensive as to tell me that Her driver came to my apartment knocked and called me to let me know she was there. Well all would be fine if she didn't lie to her manager about her calling me when she didn't. As I proceeded to tell the manager that she never called me and tried to tell her that I was here the entire time, the manager began to raise her voice at me and my family members could hear her yelling at me trying to contradict what happened when she wasn't present. I began to ask her for her corporate office phone number because I didn't appreciate her yelling at me and she said that Pizza Hut doesn't have a corporate office so I asked her for her managers info and she told me that his name was josh and that he was the general manager. I asked her for Josh's phone Humber and she refused to provide it to me and advised me that he would be there on Monday and I could call back then. I asked her to re order the food because everyone was hungry so she replaced the order. When the delivery guy came about 20 minutes later, he didn't even give me a receipt. I will be calling Monday and speaking with josh to let him know how horrible their customer service is."}
{"text":"Online order came 40 min later than told, pizza was cold. Their credit card machine wasn't working either...worst experience ever."}
{"text":"The girl working here was quite rude as if she didn't want to be there. Like if you don't like the job, don't do it. Anyways, the  pizza is like any other pizza hut but I just don't recommend coming here just because I can get better service at a pizza hut else where."}
{"text":"I have made several orders to this Pizza Hut. Not only are they expensive, they have never gotten my order correct. Relatively frustrating when you are ordering delivery and have to wait another hour to get the correct order. They never offered to refund my money or anything, we just had to wait for the correct order to get there. Horrible customer service."}
{"text":"Very very slow delivery. Not a happy customer at all. We love the pizza but the service is quite lacking. Multiple times now we have been quoted 45 minutes only to wait an hour or longer for the food."}
{"text":"**Rating based on Carry-Out Experience**

Placed our order online to be picked up at 6:15pm. I arrived at 6:05, desperately needing to use the restroom. The men's room was locked and indicated \"for customers only.\" I walked over to the counter and the keys were already out and ready to go. 

I gave the cashier my name and she told me it would be a couple minutes. The restaurant is decently sized. It looks and feels like you're in an older McDonald's or Taco Bell. I do appreciate the option to sit down, and might take them up on that during a future visit. 

About 6:13, the pizza came out piping hot. It smelled great too. They handed me our 2 liter bottle of Pepsi and I was on my way. No complaints - quick service, though not altogether remarkable. This location isn't situated in the fanciest part of town, so I can understand the reviews unsettled by the poor cleanliness. Though, when I was there, it looked fairly kept up and inviting.

FYI - they've got special deals for first-time online orders, which ours was not. 

Pizza hut, ladies and gentlemen."}
{"text":"Uncooked crap & just a reminder on why I rarely eat junk food. Ended up with horrible stomach pains!!"}
{"text":"Their wings are terrible! They are fat balls deep fried with a disgusting flavor.   Definitely do not order those.  The pizza is fair."}
{"text":"So... last night I had some people over at my house and the guests got a bit hungry so I went online and ordered us two medium hawaiian pizzas (regular crust) and some wings. The wings were good BUT the pizza... that's a whole other story. It was DRY, one to two pineapples per slice and it was ALL crust and bearly any pizza and some of it was burned. Even though it didn't even looked delicious I gave it to my guests... I was so embarrased but they were hungry and that was all I could give them, unfortunately. I seriously ALWAYS buy pizza hut but it's been my second time buying it at this location and it SUCKS. Paid $40 and it was the worst pizza ever.  Never buying there again."}
{"text":"It's been years since we've been here bc of how bad it's been in the past. We visited on 6/10/17.  Our server was very nice & the food was great! The remodel & newer management really flipped it around.  Worth a second chance for those apprehensive from past experiences."}
{"text":"I went to this Pizza Hut to get carry out pizzas for years.  In the past six months I've gone twice.  The place kind of smells, I'm not sure what it is but it isn't good.  Yesterday I went in and ordered the new Big Dinner Box.  While it was cooking I went next door to get some groceries and returned about 15 minutes later.  I was standing in the front waiting for the pizza to come out of the oven and I noticed the guy & girl working in the back.  They were getting pizzas and breadsticks out of the oven and cutting & boxing them.  While doing this I saw both of them pop some food in their mouths.  Then even worse I saw the guy lick his finger and keep handling the food.  Then he rubbed his nose with the side of his hand!  I stepped up to the register and requested my money back.  After I explained what I had seen the cashier gave me my money back promptly and said that she would speak to them.  I probably won't go back, ever.  There are lots of other pizza places within a mile of this place, I've heard that Bella Pizza a mile south is good, I'll have to try that."}
{"text":"Let me say first that when you call the number for Pizza Hut and expect to talk to the actual store to place your order, think again.  What happens, even though the number is a local number, you are redirected to a call center.  Yes a call center, it's not bad enough that telemarketers use a call center, but why do I need a call center to order a pizza from a shop up the road?  To make matters worse if your address does not show up for them they will put you on hold and then attempt to transfer you to the store.  What happened to me was that each time they transferred me (which was three times) I was hung up on.  Each time.  Then they acted like it was my fault this was happening, one time when I called back and was explaining my situation the gentleman on the other end interrupted me and said if I wouldn't cooperate he would end the call.  If you want my business you will make this work, not threaten me.  It is not my fault that I want to talk to someone in this store to place my order and not talk to a third party placing my order.  What is so difficult about making this happen?  Once again, why do we need a call center for a Pizza Hut order?

When I finally did get to talk to the girl at this location it was like I was inconveniencing her. Placed my order and waited.  The only good thing about this experience was that after twenty minutes on the phone placing the order the order actually showed up earlier than what they quoted me.  However, the food was cold by the time it was delivered and the pizza was kind of put together lopsided.

Another thing they do not list on their site or tell you over the phone is that there is a $3 delivery fee.  

Lesson learned here, you want good, fresh food; order from a local shop and not a national chain.

**Note: this is a delivery/pick up only location, no dine in available here."}
{"text":"I would rate this a zero if i was able to.

I ordered 2 medium pizzas and 2 orders of chicken wings for delivery.  When the food was delivered no chicken wings were delivered I called the store and told them of the mistake.  I was referred to a manager by the name of \"Venegas\".  She apologized for the mistake and asked if we still wanted the wings to which we replied \"yes\".  Venegas said she would get it to us as soon as possible.  Fast forward one hour and 5 minutes and we still had not received the wings.  So, once again, I called the store and asked to speak to a manager.  This time I talked to Jessica.  It turned out that the wings that were supposed to be delivered were never made or sent out for delivery.  Jessica apologized, said she was not aware of the situation and put me on a brief hold.  When she got back to me she stated that she could get us the wings and a $10 credit (which does not cover the actual expense of the 2 orders of chicken wings).  If you were to look at my order history with your company you will see that I am a frequent customer (I would assume more frequent than most).  But, after today that will no longer be the case.  I am the type of person who hates to complain but to actually just ignore my first complaint and do nothing about it is inexcusable and just plain bad customer service.  It is one thing to have an employee make a mistake and not follow through but to have a manager fail to deliver as promised shows poor expectations even above management level.


Fast forward another 25 min.. we received the wings but not the voucher as was promised."}
{"text":"This location is really bad. Customer service is poor. Ordered some pizzas online and they were 30 minutes behind for carry out.  Not too much of an issue. I saw some pizzas go in their warmer and until I came up about 5 minutes later to see if they know what happened to my order, they went to pull it out. I brought it home later to a party just to realized their dough was undercooked and didn't rise. It was hard as stale breadsticks. I called to tell the store manager the issue and he said he could remake it now or let me order the same thing another time with the order saved in their system. We decided on the later. Called in tonight just to realize they cannot offer to remake it because that deal wasn't present. I asked if I could order it online and apply the credit that they spoke of when I got to the store and they said no, and had to order over the phone. They also did not honor online deals. Ordering a pizza with the same reproducible quality and understandable customer service does not have to be this difficult. There's a lack of communication and accountability."}
{"text":"When in a pinch for a quick pizza, this Pizza Hut location serves up some great grub. I've had better luck getting carryout with them as opposed to delivery. Their delivery people seem to run behind schedule quite often. When I do get carryout, the staff is friendly, and the location is kept clean. Highly recommend getting the Meat Lovers in the thin crust...yum."}

We called back and they lady on the phone said \"well what do you want me to do about it\" I told her I wanted sauces for the food I ordered and she was rude and said, \"well do you want to drive here to get them\"  Are you kidding me! How about use some customer service. We called back after they hung up on us and then said they would put us on hold to talk to their manager. Well 15 minutes later still NOTHING!!!!"}

{"text":"They messed up the first pizza, no cheese on one side  (how that happens is beyond me). So we waited for a replacement which was even worse,  barely any sauce and less cheese than the first one.  They did give us both pizzas for the price of one else, but it should have been free."}

But today it was 15 minutes late and when I called to check the status of my driver, the girl who answered, Shaniqua (something like that, she said it so fast) was SO RUDE! Was huffing and puffing when I asked to check the status of my order. She was unprofessional, full of attitude and obviously bothered that she had to do her job. They were out of the soda we purchased, the pizza was lukewarm and by the time we did get it, I was so irritated with how I was treated that I couldn't wait to get done so I could write this review. I don't think we will ever get pizza from here again."}
{"text":"Wow! These are some downright brutal reviews! 

I am not a huge Pizza Hut fan, but it is pretty cheap. After having Rosati's a lot lately, we decided just to throw something different in the mix. A large pizza was less than $10, which was substantially cheaper than the Rosatis's equivalent (as much as I love it).

We ordered online and the pizza was ready right when it was scheduled to be picked up. When I went to pick up the order, the lady working the counter was polite and friendly. I honestly can't believe this is that same place that earned all these scathing reviews! 

As for the pie its self, well, it's a Pizza Hut pizza. It is what it is. It's doughy and thick and always seems to be a bit too greasy. It was alright for a quick fix for our little party for the night. One thing I will give them is that there were copious amounts of toppings on the pie. No skimping out there!

I was undecided between 2 or 3 stars for this review, but for what it is, Pizza Hut is okay. Don't expect to be blown away, but it is cheap pizza.

This can't hold a candle to some of the other Pizza places in the area (Grimaldi's, Rosati's, etc), but it is serviceable for a chain pizza. Honestly I don't see this being a regular destination for me.

It is what it is. Which is just a-okay.

3 stars."}

Fortunately the Hawaian and Barbeque chicken pizzas were both excellent and served piping hot.  The girl at the register was quite friendly with the kids in our group and had a great attitude."}
{"text":"Pizza Hut on Mc 85 in Buckeye has great customer service and there pick up time is excellent. The food is ok ."}
{"text":"It's 7:06 right now, we havent ordered our drinks, and we have been here since 6:10. It's been nearly an hour and nobody has come to take our order. Its not even that busy in here, half the restaurant's tables are unoccupied. Im hangry"}
{"text":"DO NOT MAKE ONLINE ORDERS WITH A CREDIT CARD!! The manager Paul King told me and I quote \" I don't have time to deal with your issue.... were extremely busy\" Then he says \" I know exactly what happened... Your bank processed the transaction but it will cancel out when our system closes tonight at midnight and then it'll process back to your account cause this happens all the time and the order never goes through on our end\" I explained that it took the monies from my account for (2) transactions. He says \"that's on your banks end and you'll get your money back after midnight\" I have never had such a BAD EXPERIENCE with a manager. We order every Friday from them... not anymore!!! I will never patronize this establishment again!! I would of expected at the very least for him to process my order... he was not the least bit concerned that I had paid for 2 pizzas yet won't receive anything..."}
{"text":"I love Pizza Hut because you know what you're getting every time! 4 stars because the wings aren't all that wonderful (chewy, slimy), but the pizza always taste how I remember it. I like the hand tossed crust and/or the stuffed crust pizza. This location has always been reliable and delivers in the amount of time they say they will. I've ordered from this location More than 5 times and always get exactly what I ordered. I love how convenient it is to order online too. Some days I'm the Epitome of lazy so online ordering and Pizza Hut delivery rocks!"}
{"text":"Very disappointed in the customer service at this location. Not only is the workers rude they have no respect for there job or the customers food..
I have ordered here 2 times now last time they completely forgot my wings. This time my pizza looks like the driver was doing donuts in the parking lot the pizza was all over the box slices upside down. My bread sticks are burnt and have no cheese on Them when I payed for extra cheese if I could post a picture of this meal I would.. So to top it all off I called to speak to the manager and the person who answered the phone was trying to very funny and answered it in another voice and laughing then hung up on me so I called again of course after I spent my hard earned money on pizza of I am upset I have worked for pizza hut in the passed as a driver and in store worker and never have I seen this behavior toward a customer. I asked for the gentleman name he wouldn't tell me his name as a customer I know I have the right to ask for there name I will be coming in the morning to speak to a manger in person I will never order from here again thank you I'd rather drive 5 miles out of my way to pick up at another location"}
{"text":"I was planning on having a movie night, so I decided to order some pizza and wings. They have a special right now, $10 for any size pizza with any toppings, so I ordered a large pizza with half pepperoni and half mushrooms, peppers, sausage, and onions. The 8 wings I got were an extra $6.99. The total came out to about $21 because the delivery fee is $2.50 and it specifically states, \"This does not include the deliverer's tip.\" I placed my order at 6:20pm and the expected delivery time was 7:02pm, but it didn't come until 7:14pm, which was a very long wait for what I ordered. If I knew it was going to take that long before placing my order, I would've just ran down to Little Caesar's to get some Hot-N-Ready pizzas. Nonetheless, the pizza and wings were decent and the delivery lady was nice. If she didn't give me free dipping sauces I probably would've given this location 2 stars."}
{"text":"I am just not a fan of this place.  This location is near a friend of mine that I stay at and we have ordered from here 3 times now (why we keep going back, I don't know but not anymore).  They have consistently messed up our order or over charged us, they always forget either my drinks or dipping sauces,  the food is consistently sub-par sometimes almost to the point of seeming stale and they are not quick to offer solutions to fix their mistakes.

I say go to Dominos instead, but that's me."}
{"text":"This is a Pizza Hut/Wing Street. i hate to review chains unless something really stands out, but i figure there should be at least one review saying it's not a shit hole. 

Pizza Hut is an old family favorite, surprisingly for their spaghetti, so with my mom in town we tried the local Belmont location. Some locations have different bread sticks then i am used to, but this one had the delicious, garlic covered ones. Spaghetti with meat sauce was good as expected with excellent garlic bread. 

It seems like a smaller dining room, i'm not sure what was around the one wall, may have been more seating. Service was friendly enough, no complaints."}
{"text":"Like others say, the customer service here is horrible. When you're standing at the cashier they will just look at you and pretend to be busy. They do not answer phone calls even though they're not busy. As for waiting for your order, well you're going to be waiting a long time! Then they will continue to tell you just 10 more minutes everytime you ask. Doubt I'll be ordering from here again."}
{"text":"Ordered a four topping pizza.  Too much garlic, either in the sauce or in the crust, really overpowered every ingredient. No blend of flavors, just garlic."}
{"text":"The last three orders from this Pizza Hut delivery have been incorrect. The first they forgot my 2 liter. 2nd was pizza not well done as requested. Then 3rd Was Tonight, forgot an order of breadsticks, I ordered two. The first order was a half of order. I also did not receive the sauce with the breadsticks. 
When I called and complained that this was the third time they screwed up my order, the manager was able to send a free food item this time when I asked. It took an hour for both breadsticks and free item to be delivered because they were down again to one driver.
Overall food tastes like normal Pizza Hut. Make sure you check your orders."}
{"text":"The most pathetic pizza hut I have ever seen, this location clearly run by some non experienced folks. The phone just places you on hold for 10 min and then you get hang upon the afro chick who one time somehow picked up the call the only thing she was able to say is that she is kinda new. What a joke! Shame on the management...I ended up going to the Rainbow location ;)"}
{"text":"Such a traditional place for me. I'd go as a little kid and just today I took my own kids. This establishment has withstood the test of time starting with \"Lou\" back in the 80's and 90's and continuing to the present day. It's iconic murals lining the parking lot is such a Norwin landmark. The only thing I wish it still had was the Ninja Turtle arcade game right next to the checkout. Good pizza. Good service. Love it!"}
{"text":"First time I called I was hung up on. Called back and put in my order. I picked up my order and asked for cheese and peppers. I was given 1 cheese packet and like 4 pepper packets for 2 large pizzas. The guy said that's all that they had. Are times really that tough? Also I got breaksticks and no marinara sauce. 3 strikes your out pizza hut."}
{"text":"Typical pizza hut...I don't like watching all the kids that work here sneak out back for a smoke though...sometimes I wonder how clean the place is."}
{"text":"Great reliable Pizza Hut. When I want it quick-this is the place. Great staff. Not sure about the bad reviews. It's fast food pizza-people! What do you expect for 5 dollar pizza. If you want great pizza go to grimaldis and pay for it. If you want good Pizza Hut pizza get this place. That's all I got!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"My family and I ordered dinner tonight for the 4 of us. The pizza was great. My boneless chicken was a different story. I had 6 out of 8 pieces that were dry and the size of popcorn chicken from KFC. My kids ate them. Wasn't even enough for my husband and I because the pieces were to small. Next time I order (if I do) I'll remember not to order pizza hut's 8 piece popcorn chicken, I mean boneless chicken.smh."}
{"text":"Called on 7/11/2017 the worst customer service & the manager is a real twit! Very unprofessional rude & very sarcastic, ordered a lot of food, received a call stating what's your address \"it's was on the receipt\" but didn't get any response they said they called me, after they cancelling my Order, tried to talk to the manager but of course they think your lying when you tell them what \"they did wrong\" the manager crystal got very disrespectful with my girlfriend & was very rude once again. So beware they asswholes there & they will fu*k up on your toppings I bet you."}
{"text":"It's Pizza Hut, so it doesn't taste better or worse than anything I've had from other locations.  I used the online ordering system, and thankfully  I did because it seemed like they were running behind on calls when I came to pick-up my pizza.

Online told me the pizza would be ready at 7:10ish, I arrived at 7:18 and it still took a few minutes for it to come out, not a big deal, but I thought I was safe coming later.  Other than that I'll order from here again, it's close and they have stuffed crust pizza!"}
{"text":"Pizza is very hit or miss in Vegas so when I wanted a sure thing, I came to Pizza Hut.

In my opinion there are few things which can top a stuffed crust pizza.  Normally I don't even eat the crust, but having the unique cheese filled crust is something I really look forward to.

I ordered using the online feature and requested extra sauce (I wouldn't have even thought to ask if it wasn't on the site).  The advantage to online is no need for coupon clipping as they have many online specials.

Pizza Hut is a definite \"go to\" when it comes to my at home movie nights!"}
{"text":"Jus got salad from here they chanced the dressing n over cooked the chicken I'd rather go to queen street their salads on point"}
{"text":"Waited an extra hour over projected delivery time, called store to ask why and encountered a very condescending woman who was reluctant to give me managers info... re received order and it is incorrect. Ugh. Done, just done!"}
{"text":"This is the worst Pizza Hut on the planet. I walked in and stood there for 10 minutes without even being acknowledged. The guy was literally 2 feet from me and saw me but totally acted like I wasn't there! Another guy saw me from the kitchen, but not one word!! I just walked out, got in my car and left. I couldn't believe that that happened! This place doesn't even deserve 1 star."}
{"text":"They took my order and my money then just decided not to deliver EVEN AFTER I confirmed with these people that they would indeed deliver to the strip. Waited an hour for my pizza and nothing. You have failed us miserably Pizza Hut. Shame on you!!! I'm so effing angry right now."}
{"text":"These guys have the worst customer service. The \"customer service manager\" was rude and practically called me a liar saying they don't offer these codes when it was emailed to me from Pizza Hut, then I read her the email and she said oh\"you must have to order online\" which I had, that's why I was calling because i was ordering online and did enter my code yet at check out, even though it said Free Large Pizza, it was charging me hence why I called the store. Useless employees make your business awful. I feel bad as I generally like ordering from here and PS I was still paying for the rest of our order it's not like I was just ordering the free large. After not getting my issue resolved I asked that they cancel my order then received notice that all codes had been redeemed and could no longer be used so I got doubly screwed. Oh well. Their loss. I'm an easy going customer who ordered at least two to three tones a month and a great tipper. No more. I'll take my business elsewhere where they don't call you a liar and they honor their deals and actually try to resolve customer issues instead of escalating them. I can now see why they have such a poor rating. ?"}
{"text":"Why am I not surprised that this place has a 2.5 average star rating?  My experience was pretty dismal but fortunately a customer service oriented employee did her best to make things right.
I placed an online order and showed up to pick it up. It was ready to go but upon showing me the pizzas it became clear that one of hem was done wrong. I'd ordered a tomato, onion and bell pepper pizza but got one without the onion but with added mushrooms. I hate mushrooms but told the girl behind the counter that I'd just pick them off. Then I realized that it didn't have onions. I love onions, guys.  Like a fat kid loves cake.  I kind of just stood there, not wanting to make a huge deal out of the onion situation and the young lady behind the counter could tell it was, in fact, a huge deal to my onion-loving self and offered to remake the pizza.  Of course, I did have to wait an extra 15 minutes but she was very apologetic and once all was said and done offered to allow me to take the incorrect pizza - which I did cause...hello?  Free pizza!?!?
So while the order was wrong (and incidentally, there was a lady picking up just after me who's pizza was also incorrect and she told me while waiting for hers to be corrected that she was actually getting it for free because the last time she ordered they had messed up her order so this was a freebie.  Eeeeek...Pizza Hut?  If you're messing up your make-up pizzas for a previous mess-up, you gotta do something about that...)
I realize things happen and we're all human.  I appreciate the apology and generosity shown me so they saved themselves from a 2 star rating.  But 3 stars is all I'm gonna go!  And that's me reciprocating the generosity."}
{"text":"We like this store, they have a goodcustomer service . I'm giving 4 star for the store because we ordered pizza no onion and it comes out with onion but since Jonathan  shows an excellent customer service ,he make sure to informed us  about the  delays ( no worries) and he's very accommodating and apologetic, and offers us some perks while waiting. The place is clean and organized.  There pizza are  well prepared and the chicken wings are juicy and tender , they cooked it the way we wanted.,Perfect! Good job Jonathan"}
{"text":"So I wanted to give this a 2.5 start really just for a few reasons.

- there is only one server working.. cleaning all the tables and taking drinks and orders. From what I was informed she is the only one that works here and works very hard. She caters to the customer I guess for the time that she started working there she got to know what all the customers like ( if some customers don't eat meat she would put a order of veggie pizza) for the buffet. Even if you requested a type of pizza like the basic Hawaiian, pepperoni etc she will ask the cook to make it.

-service is a bit slow but again be reminded that there is only one lady but the time I went with my family which is lunch time it's very quiet.

-Tuesday kids eat free with a purchase of an adult meal so I guess it's best to bring the lil ones on Tuesday especially it's pizza which kid doesn't like pizza right.

-they have a good selection of pizza. Vegetarian(deluxe. Meat lovers, Hawaiian, cheese, pepperoni and one had sausage and tomato. The pizza are of for buffet not over cooked but I always found pizza huts pizza even in the Philippines to be very greasy guess it's they way they make it.

-They have Romain lettuce dressings are ranch, French, Italian and Ceasars and croutons so I don't know if you would want to call this a salad bar. They also had some pasta salad which lacked flavor guess you can add some of their dressing or just salt.

- there was also garlic bread slices and tomato sauce pasta which you can add more tomato sauce which they have on the side usually used to dip pizza (don't worry they have small containers to use to get your own sauce) there's also a dessert which looked like a cinnamon rolls pizza style dish unfortunately I did not try it so I can't really give any feedback but it did look good.

So.. of you want quick pizza just the basic though I can say it's òk to go here especially for the lil ones if you have any. It's very quiet and for my first time going to any pizza Hut restaurant in canada at least I can say its different and sad to see its quiet. Service does take time but they server is very friendly."}
{"text":"Had a coupon for a large two topping.Would not allow paying for a third topping? \"Computer would not accept\"?!.. Tried the Jack Nicholson \"5 Easy Pieces \"approach; ,give me a side of black olives,charge me separately for them,then put them on the pizza.. Nope, did not work either..Darn computer..Oh well so much for trying to give extra business."}
{"text":"Craving a thin crust Pizza Hut pizza last night I called this place at 8PM for a delivery..They were out of pizza,yes out of thin crust pizza...I said that's like McDonalds being out of cheeseburgers,and was hung up on!? Unbelievable!"}
{"text":"This location is closed now and they're diverting all of their calls to the location on Greenway. Bummer!"}
{"text":"One of the worse experiences with pizza ever! Waited 90 minutes for my delivery. Box was soggy, minimal cheese, burnt onions. There was no sauce for the breadsticks. When I called them, I was immediately placed on hold."}
{"text":"Awesome buffalo wings!!!!  Ordered a large pan and wings.  Pizza could do with more toppings - obviously they are skimping big time on toppings here.   The wings were good though.  Totally great wings!  Its shameful of you guys to skimp so badly on toppings!  Corporate should check u out!  I should only give 1 star but the wings were so good I am forgiving them for the pizza incident..."}
{"text":"Tried to call location for 15+ minutes straight to place a carry out order.  Finally got through as I was less than 5 minutes away from location.  I informed Justin, the manager, that I've been trying to call for over 15 minutes and he claims that he didn't hear the phone ring.  I walk in and the only order on the Carry Out screen is the one I just called in.  Very disappointing overall experience."}
{"text":"Alright, let me be honest: I never liked Pizza Hut. When I was 16 I worked there (and from my Domino's review you can catch a glimpse into what that was like) for a hot second and I have never, ever been back willingly. In fact, the one and only time I went willingly was when a then friend allowed us to stay after hours and the manager signed off on us getting free beer. We all called the place Pizza Slut. 

I know, we're so original.

Folks, we live in a new era. Pizza Hut has swayed my cold, black, franchise pizza hating stomach. I don't know who got hired and who got fired in their PR department, but hot damn whoever is in charge now is doing great. They should be hired to make North Korea look like heaven or cat vomit a delicacy. 
Ok, that's taking it a little too far, but you get my drift. 

It all started with a random StumbleUpon. The Australian contest to make your own pizza, name it and enter to win crap. Not that I can win anything here, because I live in the ol' US, but it was kind of entertaining to come up with combos. Also, they can get duck on their pizza. You hear me? Duck. 

So, I did a little internet searching and lo and behold a few months later Pizza Hut US rolled out a new menu. It was missing the duck, but that's aside from the point. It looked delicious. It promised new things. Sriracha was involved. 

Lest you think I order pizza all the time out of laziness and love, let it be known that I actually enjoy making my own and the boyfriend usually has to beg me or piss me off to get me to agree to getting delivery. I like to cook and most of the pizza places that deliver in my area think, \"Charred Crust, half a mushroom and ketchup tasting sauce\" constitutes pizza. 

Not Pizza Hut circa 2014! (and '15 now, I know)
The new menu is pretty awesome and the combinations are seemingly endless. Adding extra balsamic or sriracha drizzles or the long list of crust flavors for free is a great touch. The website is easy to navigate (I hate calling in delivery orders) and gives you a countdown that has never failed to be almost COMPLETELY on the dot accurate. The $11 ANYTHING YOU WANT (size, toppings, crust, etc.) online deal is awesome for people like me who can't make up their mind and want like 10 toppings. My pizzas used to cost a small fortune. There is an added charge for the stuffed crust, but it's a measly 2-ish bucks and I can't blame them. 
So, for the second time since I discovered this new menu, we ordered some last night. Our pizza was on time. It was tasty. They even followed my orders to make the stuffed crust pizza extra crispy. The toppings were plentiful, the sauce was excellent. I always get the creamy garlic parmesan, but they have buffalo, BBQ, honey sriracha, classic marinara and premium crushed tomato. 

tl;dr? 
Pizza Hut doesn't suck anymore. 

Also, search the internet for their newest Japan commercial that involves a bunch of cats running a store. Because. Why not?"}
{"text":"AVOID AT ALL COSTS.

Called to get a pizza delivered. Said it would be an hour, an hour and a half rolls around so I called to see if it would be faster for me to just pick it.  They said \"oh your order was canceled\"... \"My manager called you to verify a new customer profile and you didn't answer\" WHAT. No one called me. Are we not in the day and age of caller ID?!  Anyways still ordered a pizza and went to pick it up, asked to talk to the manager about how this could be avoided in the future.  (going on 2 hours of hangry now). Was treated like an idiot and like it was my fault that they took the wrong number (apparently. I think they forgot to put my order in). Absolutely THE WORST customer service I've ever encountered. DO NOT GIVE THEM YOUR BUSINESS-YOU WILL REGRET IT."}
{"text":"First, we walked in sat ourselves. We waited without being attended for about ten minutes, no menu, nothing. We order our pizza and find a hair, we get the option to get our pizza replaced or order paid for, we reorder a pizza, it comes in a to go box with the receipt ready as if we are finished eating. No refills, never dining here again."}
{"text":"This location is a hit or a miss. I don't know why sometimes they get my order wrong or give me different toppings than I had ordered. I always order through online so everything is clear but most of the time its a disappointment. Not sure if ill be ordering anytime soon unless they got a really good promo going and im craving pizza."}
{"text":"We ordered from this Pizza Hut at around 10:45 when they weren't open so we expected to wait from them to start around 11:15 we have waited an hour and tried to call multiple times. No answer and on hold for most of the time. 10 minutes later someone finally answer and was very confusing. They told us the card didn't go through so we tried the same one again and it was fine. He said they tried to call us and no answer. All the info we gave them was correct. They said they would get it out to us on the next delivery after they have kept our pizza in the warmer for up to 30 minutes. Not pleased with the service and we are still waiting on our pizza"}
{"text":"When people wonder why Pizza Hut is doing so poorly, I think of this location. Horrible. The person who took my order wasn't even capable of speaking or understanding English. I had to repeat my order at least 4 times, and it was just for a large pepperoni. The pizza took way too long to get here! I actually called the store to find out what happened! When we got our pizza, the delivery guy forgot the dipping sauce and drinks. The pizza itself was hardly even cooked around the edges, and the centre was completely uncooked. I called to complain and was told they could remake it, or take a store credit. It had already been so long that we decided to take a store credit, but I doubt I'll ever use it. Save yourself the trouble and get your pizza at the place across the road."}
{"text":"They have the worst customer service ever.  Thank god for our delivery person who got things taken care of.  We ordered 3 med pizzas - 2 the same and 1 different - and 2 orders of the apple pies.  Got 3 pizzas all the same and no dessert.  Delivery person went back to get our desserts.  Right after he left I realized the pizzas were wrong.  I spent the entire time he was gone on the phone trying to reach the store so we could catch our delivery person so he wouldn't have to make a third trip.  No such luck - they don't answer their phones.  Even the order call center couldn't get thru to them!  So our delivery person comes back with our dessert, we tell him about the pizza mistake and he said he'd use his personal phone to reach them and would be back with our pizza!!   Delivery person made his third trip - which was appreciated - but it was wrong again - made with a flavored crust - not what I ordered!!  All and all - not a good experience - and it'll be a long time before I forget it!!"}
{"text":"Amazing!!! Ordered 2 pizzas, and 24 (4 6 piece wings). Fast delivery (came sooner than quoted), fast and friendly! I am sold!!! Opened an account and tipped the driver double I usually tip. Thanks sooo much!"}
{"text":"Loved my experience!!!! I ordered online, got quoted 1130am. Arrived exactly on time! Really friendly delivery guy. Gave him a massive tip for it :-) pizza is delicious and the wings are like a screaming O in my mouth!!! Thanks!"}
{"text":"OK, finally tried them again! Over a year later, since wife was cooking our thanksgiving dinner. Yes, it's an early dinner since her and daughter had to work on thanksgiving!! I didn't feel like to shell out 70-80 dollars at a sports bar! I order two pizzas and wings. Pizza was much better, and the wings were good to. will have to try again, to see if they make our good list again!!"}
{"text":"Terrible customer service!! The self proclaimed Manager April yelled at me and refused a refund or a credit toward next purchase. She lied to us twice about our delivery being out. We ordered at 8:54 and at 10:32 it still had not left and she would not tell me that and kept yelling at me. I will NEVER order from this location again. Delivery estimate was 35/45 minutes. I had a friend call because she kept hanging up on me or just not answering and ask for the GM name and she asked her if she wanted it for me and gave out my info. WTH. Some ppl should not work with the public and April you suck!!!"}
{"text":"Excellent carry out pizza. At first, I was hesitant due to the fact that Pizza Hut is not what is used to be in the 90s when I grew up. But, I was very surprised with what I had. I ordered the \"Canadian\" pizza which comes with mild sausage, bacon crumbs and pepperoni. Fresh flavour sauce and ingredients.
Totally recommended"}
{"text":"Exactly what I expected for the price and for pizza hut love the food and the wait staff was friendly and there when I needed them I sat for the entire buffet time and was not bothered or asked to leave I like that :) ad for the decor meh again about what youed expect the same as any other :p over all I had a peaceful time with some good and greasie good grate if u got a hangover :)"}
{"text":"I decided to order a carry out, when I arrived was immediately greeted by customer service. Since this had the WingStreet option, I ordered an eight piece bone out wings with a p-zone. Said it would take about 15 mins. Notice they were busy, it was Friday afternoon. But the cooking area seemed to be having a lot of fun. The manager was one of them, their drivers were standing around waiting for their orders to come out. I did get my order with in twenty minutes, no problem.  Since their competitor Domino's is across the street from them, you would think they would do all of the little extras to keep their flow of customers? Inside of this place looks like the surrounding area! Just because you live or work in the ghetto doesn't mean you have to act like it? Clean the place up! Replace the missing panels in your lowered ceiling! Put some coats of paint on the wall, spruce the place up? I have always enjoyed Pizza Hut, and I will continue to use them. But next time in this area, I just might go across the street?"}
{"text":"Worst Pizza Hut ever. Phone wait time are 15 mins,and the employees have bad attitude. I live very close,but I avoid this Pizza Hut."}
{"text":"Right around the corner on the strip. Pizza took an hour and a half to arrive and was cold."}
{"text":"Really disappointed with the quality of the food and management. Just now received my order of Buffalo Wings and a Pizza. The wings should be named Burnt Wings.. Yes because I received 8 charcoal looking Burnt Bone out wings. And when I called the store the female who answered my call didn't even apologize and she said she is the manager. She said she can send the replacement .. I said No.. Thanks, and she will receive few pictures from me very soon.. A restaurant can't serve burnt food to its customer.. Don't they do quality check. This was my last order from this store . This store is in a serious need of new management or they should shutdown."}
{"text":"My husband and I placed an order for pick up and we're given a time the food would be ready. When we got there the pizza was done but the wings hadn't even been started. We noticed our pizza wasn't even in the warmer. The employees wouldnt even acknowledge us. By the time we finally got everything home the pizza was cold and the food was just OK at best."}
{"text":"Normally I wouldn't make a bad post about a business, but this Pizza Hut has consistently been horrible when it comes to delivery. The website rarely updates, so you don't know if they got your order.  Then the update isn't correct (such as updating an estimated  time of arrival, or what you actually ordered). My main concern is with the delivery. In the last 6 months,  I'd say I might have ordered from them 5 times (because I love their pizza and where I live now I can't find a decent pizza). I have had to wait probably 4 out of those 5 times for the delivery driver to return with the rest of my order  (tonight they forgot my wings and a 2 liter of diet pepsi. Most often it's the pop, or they'll send regular pepsi which my gf can't drink because she's a diabetic). They'll say the manager handed it to them wrong and they'll bring the rest out. I wait for up to an hour for the rest of the order. It's just ridiculous because if you can read...(which I sincerely hope they all can do), that you'll see a large pizza and  breadsticks doesn't cost $42 and perhaps you're missing something! I give them one star because most of the time my food is good and/or still warm. Pizza hut please get it together so people like me will still order from you!"}
{"text":"This place has come a long way over the last few years. Until recently, the service was dreadful and the length of time it took to get a simple pepperoni pizza and breadsticks could be as early as 45 minutes if the place was empty and as far as refills, forget about it. So we just stopped going in and would order for pick-up before making the 30 minute drive to get it. 

About 6 months ago, one of my kids insisted on eating inside the restaurant. I was shocked to see a full staff and the server was attentive and the pizza was delicious. I was so surprised that it tasted like the Pizza Hut pizza I enjoyed so much when I was a kid, 400 miles away. 

Overall, I give it a 4-star rating. The server we usually have is great but some of the other staff I've encountered aren't as friendly."}
{"text":"So my husband and I ordered a pizza on Saturday, & when we saw it was going to take an hour and a half, we tried to call and cancel it. Nobody at the shop would answer the phone, even when the Pizza Hut regional call center (?) tried to contact them. No one at the call center could cancel the order. I was told that if the shop doesn't answer the phone there is no way of cancelling a pizza, so it was delivered anyway. It's now Wednesday and I still haven't heard from Pizza Hut customer service about a refund for an order that I tried to cancel 5 different times."}
{"text":"What a place . They never answer the phone. Went to get pizza and the internet did not let me put the code in for taking the survey. Counter girl said she would let me slide. This place is a joke . Will find another place to get a simple pizza. Don't take the survey because it is a waste of time you don't get a 10$ credit on specials . A lot of other places that make pizza"}
{"text":"Worst Pizza Hut location ever. Stay far far away from them. Never dealt with such rude people before. Extremely unprofessional."}
{"text":"The Fountain Hills Pizza Hut has horrible customer service and pizza.
The last time we ordered a pizza from there, we had 2 medium ones, both were bad, but one was not worth eating due to way too much sauce and toppings that were too few, plus the crust was burnt. I called upon opening the box and was told that they had a new person making the pizzas and she understood. She would credit me for a medium or I could drive back to get another one. I choose the credit, but offered to return the pizza so they could see how bad it was. She said she knew, so not to worry. Today I tried to order another medium pizza and was told it would cost $11 on top of the $5.99 credit they gave me for the same pizza. 
A medium pizza is a medium pizza, but they wouldn't honor it. Honestly, their pizzas have gone downhill anyway. The manager said her name was Mercedes and didn't care or want to work anything out. Only a few doors down is Papa Murphy's anyway, which is MUCH better."}
{"text":"Absolutely horrible, delivered my food to the wrong house, insisted that I don't know my own address, and refused to fix the problem."}
{"text":"I am done giving this place a try, three or four times I ordered and got stale old pizza crust. The pizza dough was disgusting in taste. I used to work at a Pizza Hut, so I know what the quality should be like. This place is always lacking. Lacking toppings, and lacking cheese. The company that owns the Pizza Huts in the area should be fined from Pizza Hut Corp for being so awful!"}
{"text":"My review of Pizza Hut kind of reflects Pizza Hut as a whole. The pizza has gone downhill drastically. I've been to this location only a handful of times and was never impressed with the quality of pizza or the service. Slow responses to requests and very few well like pizzas placed on the buffet makes it hard to like. 

There carryout service is quick and orders have always been accurately placed."}
{"text":"REVIEW ON DELIVERY:

Haven't done Pizza Hut in a while. Ordered in recently one night with a friend when wings sounded like a good idea. Explored local joints (Venezia's was one) online and they looked good, but Pizza Hut online won us over for the price and the 20% off coupon they give for your first online delivery order.

Popped our collective PH delivery cherry with a 20 bone-out wing sampler (honey bbq, American, buffalo mild, & garlic parmesan). Total before tip was a little over $13. Took nearly an hour to deliver. Delivery person was friendly during our brief exchange. I just wish they'd been a little closer to the 30-min estimate. 

We learned bone-out wings are simply stunted deep-fried chicken fingers drenched in sauces. Maybe you knew this, but we didn't. Unpleasant realization. I could've purchase a bag of frozen chicken tenders myself, chopped them up and added sauces for the same effect. 

Anyway, garlic parmesan was by far the tastiest. Honey bbq was (surprise!) too sweet and almost teriyaki-ish. The American and buffalo were nearly indistinguishable and fire-red, salty, and sour. 

More than filling for the 2 of us but this first time is probably my last with these \"wings\", though I'm sure \"bone-in\" is probably better. So 2 stars for convenience/price, and plus 1 because they actually have a download of their nutritional info on the website. Full disclosure deserves extra props in my book."}
{"text":"Super fast food delivery!
I've ordered online from them several times and only on the busiest of holidays is the delivery time estimate even close to correct. Normally it will say 45+ min and I'll get my pie in 20. 
Hot and fresh (as Pizza Hut gets anyway) and the delivery drivers are always kind and friendly. 
Only negative, they sometimes skimp on the garlic flavor for the crust, which is super delicious if you've never tried it."}
{"text":"Favorite Pizza hut by far! New in the neighborhood and absolutely loving it! Great fast service! Not like most places I've been, they provide you with crushed peppers, Parmesan cheese and ranch dipping sauce Free of Charge. Not only that, but they ask you if you want more than what they have given you. I will most definitely will be coming here more often!"}
{"text":"Haven't had a Pizza Hut pizza in ages, but had a coupon for 2 pizzas with 2 toppings for $6.99 each so I thought I give them another chance. In the past we found the Pizza Hut pizzas too greasy and soggy in the middle. This time the pizzas were spot on. The hand tossed crust was soft around the edges with just the right amount of sauce and ingredients and no soggy middles!
Parking is easy and the staff was friendly and efficient. The pizza was ready exactly when they said it would be."}
{"text":"I know people will still come and eat here even after reading all the horrid reviews.. But seriously though, this place has a bunch of dumbasses working here. I called around 10:35 at night no one picked up... I called back in ten minutes... No answer... By the way, all this is happening
Ehile driving there...I end getting  there and see all the workers outside smoking.. No one was inside at all! The phone was ringing off the hook. Customers were waiting for their pizza also. This will be the last time I ever come here ever. 

Dear Management if you are reading this, I advise you to fix this piece of shit location. I am currently typing this as I wait for my pizza in this crap establishment, my pizza better be good."}
{"text":"2 Words sum up my experience of the food I ordered, one is SALTY, the other DISCUSSING. Sorry but I am being brutally honest here, The person who answered the phone for this delivery order was extremely nice, helpful and above average customer relation skills. The food however was salty and discussing.

Our thin crust cheese was cooked OK but salty as hell and I mean really really salty beyond the point of being edible, The order of Chicken wings was also salty beyond the point of being edible, One good point other than the phone guy would be our 2 liter Mt Dew was cold!! 

Seriously over rated or we were completely unlucky, Never again but then I should of known better than to put faith in Pizza Hut in the first place.

My 9 and 11 year old both told me it tasted good, this worries me that our youth is being fed food like this and think its good!!! LOL

Whats with all the salt I mean Come On really??"}
{"text":"Pizza Hut added more ingredients and this was delicious. Amanda was very friendly. We carry out our food and it was on time. Thank you."}
{"text":"Quick and friendly service! They also have a lunch buffet from 1130-130, but I am not sure what it consists of, as I missed the cut off time. I miss the old Pizza Huts with the salad bar and great wings!"}
{"text":"Fast and friendly lunchtime service. In and out in less than 30min. Food hot and fresh! The staff make you feel as if you are important and even remember regular customers and what they order. There was a postman that arrived after I did, the waitress greeted him, and told him his regular order, and he said it was correct. I will go here whenever I am in the area and want Pizza!"}
{"text":"I just placed an order with this Pizza Hut and the driver couldn't find my location so just went back to the Pizza Hut location with no voicemail left or anything. I work at school and today is pizza day so now my kids have to miss out on eating after all their parents paid for it. I'm really disappointed and Shame on the manager for not being apologetic or helpful. He didn't offer to resend the pizza out or anythjng. SHAME ON YOU GUYS!"}
{"text":"I placed a delivery at about 5:00pm, it's 6:30pm and still no pizza, I live three blocks away and the \"driver got lost\"...why not be honest and say you're backed up or a tad busy?, that's understandable, be honest, then the young lady over the phone says \"we'll give you ten dollars off your next order...really?, ten dollars?, that's the best you can do?, unbelievable...now I'm HANGRY, you disappointed me today Pizza Hut, I guess I'll do Blaze Pizza today, the drivers there never get \"lost\"...and its always hot and fresh with no excuses or \"ten\" dollar discounts...

{"text":"The employees are very rude. This Pizza Hut does not know the meaning of customer service. There is a manager named Miranda on first shift. I believe it's her goal to work as least as possible so she is rude to customers so they don't come back. I called and they were rude on the phone, I went in they were rude in person. While I was leaving very unsatisfied there was a customer coming in with complaints. I would say pick any other Pizza Hut, even if it's out your way. You will thank me later"}
{"text":"I placed an order online for the large two topping pizza, went to pick it up (i had a gut feeling to check it before I left) when I got home I opened the box and there were 8 burnt slices of disappointment. I will not be revisiting this location again."}
{"text":"I know I'm being generous with my vote o'five stars right now because I'm  super hungeeee... But thank you for being open this late and for delivering my goodness to me!"}
{"text":"The fallowing morning Eddie another store manger called & gave me a $15 credit... We order a stuff crust & breadstick with our credit and everything was fine. Me and my boyfriend still agree \" NO more pizza from Pizza Hut\" lol"}
{"text":"Really horrible customer service. Pizza hadn't been delivered after an hour so I called. Took another hour to get through to someone. Employee called me \"nasty\" for wanting a refund after being hung up on twice. Don't order from this location. Really unprofessional behavior."}
{"text":"Deal right now. Buy any medium or large pizza and get the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th medium $5 (equal or lesser value to the full price pizza). Got that. All 4 mediums. Pre-set seems to be $16.99 (regular price).

Had:

Grilled Chicken Arrabbiata - Not bad, but not my favorite. A tad bit more of a kick than I thought there would be from the chili flakes on the tip. This one has chicken breast, roasted red peppers, green peppers, red onion, and basil pesto marinated tomatoes. I had one slice of this. I could be wrong, but I think the toppings were in small bits. I prefer to be able to tell what toppings I'm eating, instead of having what looks like big sprinkles. I didn't completely detest this pizza, but I doubt I'd order it again.

Smokey Maple Bacon - At first glance, I totally couldn't tell what pizza this was. The toppings were blanketed by cheese. I saw mushrooms and meat (bacon) bits. Maple bacon strips were invisible. This has alfredo sauce, not tomato. It made things a tad oilier than the typical pizza. This one I'd order again.

Super Supreme and Supreme Lover's - between the two, if you're into toppings, supreme lover's is a lot better deal (at least at this location). The supreme lover's has fewer individual toppings than the super supreme, so I assumed that that would mean more of each individual topping. I was wrong. Not cool. That being said, the super supreme had black olives (which I really like) because the add a little salty kick to my pizza. 

Service: I had to give the lady at the counter my name three times before she got it. When my mother and I both thanked her at the end, she did not respond at all..."}
{"text":"I have a bunch of issues with this Pizza Hut location, primarily having to do with their service.

Came on Saturday night around somewhere between 7:30 and 8:00. There was (unless I didn't see the rest of them for the entire night) one waitress for the entire restaurant. 

Issues:
1) It took about 20 minutes after we ordered drinks for us to get them...and all of us just ordered water.
2) Half of our party of 8 got their cutlery. The rest of us just didn't... We ended up having to take cutlery from the empty table next to us.
3) One of the two stalls in the girl's washroom had no toilet paper. The other one was locked from the inside. When we informed the server, she didn't rectify the situation immediately. My friend eventually gave up and ended up using the accessible washroom. Um...what if there had been an accident somewhere? That seems...unsanitary.
4) They have a stuffed crust promotion going on. \"Stuff your crust for free\". The fine print says that it isn't available with any other promotion or offer. We got a family combo. To my knowledge, this is neither a promotion or an offer. We were told we couldn't stuff our crust. Um...what? To make things worse, they didn't let us know until about 10 minutes after we had ordered our food. 
5) Did you know that changing your sauce base counts as a topping? Pizza Pizza, which isn't a sit down pizza place, lets you do that for free.
6) The fettucine alfredo was one dimensional. It tastes like its frozen TV dinner equivalent. We asked for parmesan cheese and were told they were out of it. 

Taste-wise, the food is alright. It's stomach-heavy food (or well, the pizza and the breadsticks are).

+ 1 for real bacon in their Caesar salad.

I won't voluntarily be coming back."}
{"text":"Decided to write this review while waiting for my carry-out that is 25+ minutes overdo. This is the third straight time I've had this same exact experience at the same location. Will definitely drive the extra miles to find a more professional pizza hut. Signing off."}
{"text":"Good service via delivery. Time to delivery was good. Food was good.

Was disappointed when I drove there for the first time. Only problem was that there wasn't any seated areas - it was a grab 'n go kind of Pizza Hut. My wife and I were looking for a sit-down restaurant."}
{"text":"This location is officially a Wing Street now. Which means more, better, wing options, wedge fries, mozz sticks, and sandwiches. This location has been one of the better Pizza Hut's Ive been too. As along as you go in before or even after rush hour you'll have  great service. If you want pizza for dinner be sure to order before dinner. As silly as it sounds, you'll avoid having to wait an hour or more just for your pizza no matter if its carry-out or delivery. Ive learned the hard way thats theres no way Im going to get fed in 30 mins. I had a mix up once with my order, the cashier didnt know what to do about, I assume they were new. But one of the waitresses stepped in and took care of the situation for me. Got me a fresh pizza made with the correct toppings. She even offered me a store credit for next time if I didnt want to wait for another pizza to be made. 

The dining area has greatly improved since the first time I ate here a few years ago. Now they even have flat screen tvs up. I stopped in to pick up a pizza for the super bowl and was surprised the dining area was completely empty. I think for next year I'm going to skip on inviting ppl over to my house and just have the super bowl party at Pizza Hut. Heck! If we can the place to ourselves and not have to clean up, why not?

And be sure to sign up for their rewards program!!"}
{"text":"Terrible pizza, terrible customer service. The manager Crystal was arguing with me for about 15 minutes on the phone about the quality of the pizza, saying \"So out of 40 other people who ordered tonight you're the only one who thinks it's bad.\" Them she went on to say that she had no idea how to resolve the issue. Then she said she would only refund up to $20 of my order, which was $33. She said it's not like they can just give food away. I told her all I wanted was my money back. She said they couldn't do that. I said send me edible pizza then. She said pick the 2 you want to replace. I told her everything or I was coming down there to talk to someone who knows what they're doing. She said her boss was going out tonight so she had to hurry and ask if she could replace the order. Apparently the boss is competent unlike Crystal and ordered her to replace the mall. All in all, Crystal is a moron and should not be manager of anything. Pizza was terrible both times but I give up. Simply won't order from that place again."}
{"text":"One and a half hours to wait for ice cold pizza. If I could give no stars, I would. Pizza was pretty flavorless, too."}
{"text":"Whoever works from 3-5PM Saturday. You guys are complete morons. I don't know why I even bother ordering anymore when they've messed up my last 3 orders! Come on guys. Check to see if the order is right before delivery. Don't jip on the quality of service. And when you hear a girl saying the in background \"what is she complaining about?\" It just totally puts you off to even wanting to do business with this location. Completely unprofessional. You guys are the ones who messed up on the order and forgot a whole entree! And the driver tried to have me sign and tip him before checking the items telling me that forgotten entree was in the pizza boxes. How is that even possible? It's not a dinner box. Like seriously, your guys' job is not that hard. Basic and common sense. Hello. ? If management wants to contact me feel free. This issue needs to be addressed."}
{"text":"It's unbelievable to me that a place with historically bad service stays in business. This is unfortunately the one that delivers to my house. Well at least until this last last last straw. They rarely get the order right as it is (I like light sauce but, they slather it on and pay no attention to the option I select online almost every time) but, tonight I waited over and hour and 15 minutes before I called them. The person that answered says my order will be delivered as soon as the driver gets back!! Why in the world wouldn't someone call me and tell me so I could make other arrangements?! I'm so tired of this pizza hut I just can't say enough bad things about it. It's a travesty that it's still in business. Tonight I cancelled my order - got dressed - went out and picked up food even though I don't feel well. This location is the worst and has been for years."}
{"text":"I cannot believe how horrible their service is. You can't get through and when you do they put you on hold again!!!! It's so irritating. This is not the first time but enough is a enough!!!! I will never call them or get pizza from there again. Papa johns it is!!!!!!!  0 STARS"}
{"text":"Just ordered a pizza from this location and I promise I will never return here. Had a horrible experience there is this guy named Christian who treated me with such disrespect it was disgusting. The attitude, the way he was talking to me and how he slammed my pizza on the counter was horrible. This guy needs to find a better job. He has no customer service skill and would be better off washing toilets and some office building at night."}
{"text":"confused as to why this place only has two stars? Jordan is an AMAZING  manager & so young yet so ambitious. I have never been treated with anything but complete respect and top-notch customer service. C'mon guys this is our local Pizza Hut and everyone that works here is phenomenal time to bump up their rating!!! I love how they give me the latest specials when I call and Jordan always says have a wonderful day:) xoxo keep it up guys!"}
{"text":"I ordered a pizza through the app tonight, and was extremely disappointed in the service and quality of what I received.  I showed up to pick up my pizza, and it had been made incorrectly.  All the employees said was that I would have to wait another 15 minutes while they re-made the pizza.  I waited and when the new pizza was ready, they let it sit for another 5 minutes until I finally asked for them to check on the pizza.  The re-made pizza still was not correct, but I did not have another 15 minutes to wait.  Again, the employees did nothing to try to make things right.  i will not be back to this location!!!"}
{"text":"Customer service is terrible.  Wanted to charge me 15$ for a medium pizza, when a large is 7.99.  Manager actually hung up the phone on me.  Place is a dump, and they have screwed up orders in the past"}
{"text":"Ordered daily special. More than half the pizza was the crust. The owner must be really cheap. Avoid this place at all costs!"}
{"text":"I order online on Valentines Day this year. I ordered the special heart shaped pizza with extra pepperoni. I was excited and couldn't wait. Once the delivery guy came by. I opened the box my pizza was looking right. It was pretty over cooked by looking at the crust. I just brushed off. So I ate the pizza. Later, my throat started bothering me. The next day, I got a sore throat from it. I got sick eating this. Thank you for getting me sick whoever did something to my pizza."}
{"text":"Amazing service! I had pre-ordered for the wrong time. Call the Morning of pickup and let them know what time I'd be in. Walked in at a minute till my pickup time and it was still cooking. Great fresh pizza, exactly as I ordered. Smiling customer service, friendly atmosphere, clean pickup. Thanks guys:))"}
{"text":"Ordered the $7.99 on-line special.  Go to pick it up, girl-in-a-daze can't find the order given my name, phone number, or e-mail.  Guy walks over, finds the order in two seconds, gets the pizza in 4 seconds.  Girl just stands there stoned.
Pizza was OK but too salty."}
{"text":"Great job last night on my order I got it hot fresh and tasty. Bread sticks where spot on too. Love hand tossed! Will be ordering again!"}
{"text":"This place was the most horrible pizza hut I have ever been to.
First there was no one to greet anyone when I walked in, and there were already 2 people waiting, I asked if they have been helped and they said no.. Seriously someone could have walked out with the register and no one would have noticed...
Finally after 10 mins..( seriously) a girl walked out and instead of asking who's next, she just helped whoever was standing I almost walked out...she went Togo help me and I spoke up for the other people saying you should ask who was here first... Horrible servIce, just horrible, my chicken wings looked like they were deep fried in acid.. My pizza cheese looked like brown spotted burnt cheese, service was the same as the pizza terrIble! Never ever going back there, you can't even pay me Togo back there!"}
{"text":"It's close to home and cheap. All I can say.  Being a pizza fanatic, its not even in my top 15."}
{"text":"I am an avid lover of Pizza Hut wings. I usually always order the Hawaiian Teriyaki wings back home in the states, but unfortunately it's not on the menu over here, so instead I ordered my second favorite option, Honey Garlic. 

The delivery time was pretty fast, I will give them that. Around 20 minutes. 

The wings on the other hand, were kind of a disappointment. They were so small that the box was only half way filled. They don't give more to compensate either, so I got 22 small wings instead of bigger juicier ones that I'm used to from other locations. The honey garlic sauce was decent, though. 

Just wish they gave more wings for the price, since they are so much smaller than usual."}
{"text":"What a cluster****. I have ordered from this location so many times with zero problems. I ordered delivery for my family tonight using the online app, and it said it would be delivered in 37 minutes. One hour goes by, so I call them. They claimed that I called in and cancelled the order....Um, no. I told them I had the email and the text from Pizza Hut, why TF would I call and cancel? They probably just didn't make it or see it, but were too stubborn to fess up. So regardless of the situation, I said I still wanted my food...they claimed they already refunded my credit card so I would have to pay again (another lie).  Finally I ask to speak to the Manager, and the guy claimed he was the manager. I asked for his name so I could call Corporate and complain (which I did). He claimed his name was 'Rock'. I kid you not. Of course he refused to give me his last name/employee number...probably because 'Rock' doesn't exist. The good news is the guy at Corporate was super apologetic, but I am not optimistic anything will get resolved. I know people say this all the time, but I will never order from that Pizza Hut again, and you shouldn't either."}
{"text":"Not friendly at all.... Pizza Hut is not what it use to be the quality of the pizza has dropped big time."}
{"text":"This is the worst Pizza Hut I've ever been to. They've messed up my order twice.

Occasion #1: I ordered a 6 piece BONE OUT and they gave me bone in. No big deal, it was 9pm and everyone makes mistakes.

Occasion #2: I ordered an 8 piece BONE OUT and they gave me a 6 piece bone in. At this point I'm upset because they messed up twice. With the amount of pizza places in the area I'll be taking my business somewhere that won't consistently mess up my order. If I could give 0 stars I would."}
{"text":"This place has a low rating for a good reason.

Everything in my order was wrong. I ordered delivery for garlic knots and a pizza with onions, black olives, tomatoes, and the hut favorite crust. I was highly disappointed to find that the garlic knots had literally no garlic or any form of seasoning on them. It looked like they threw pain dough into the oven. How do you bake that, look at the end product and decide, ehh I don't think any one will notice? These disgusting dough gods were completely inedible.

Also, the pizza had no hut favorite crust on it and was extremely sparse when it came to toppings. 

This was in no way worth what I paid. There are plenty of other pizza huts nearby. Save yourself the annoyance and go to a different one."}
{"text":"I venture to this Pizza Hut once or twice every couple months, when I get a craving for some oily deep pan pizza. Their specials are not bad, though I wish they had the same specials that the US Pizza Hut locations come out with!

They have a lunch buffet, which is pretty amazing at the price they have it for, and it is usually pretty busy every day during their lunch buffet. If you order for pickup or delivery, they are pretty good with keeping the wait / delivery time to a minimum - much better than other pizza places I've ordered from.

The staff is pretty friendly, and I always get one of two servers, and they tend to somewhat remember me every time I dine in.

Best deal I've ever got at Pizza Hut? 5 bucks 5 bucks 5 bucks. Yeah you all know what that's about!"}
{"text":"This PH constantly gets our orders wrong. The manager even reached out to us in the past but there was no follow through on what she \"promised\". We will stick to ordering at Rosatti's down the street."}
{"text":"I've had so many ups and downs from this pizza hut. Just like every other one, you pay for extra cheese and still get the same amount of cheese, less than any other company. It's damn near impossible to get a normal amount of cheese or more from this place. Secondly they almost ALWAYS forget the dips that I order and pay for. 

So I'd say 8/10 times the pizza I get is dry, overcooked and cold, and the few other times it is decent but only slightly warm.

Last Friday I put an order through the Pizza Hut app for delivery like I normally do. I got a call from the store a few minutes later saying that my house is not in their delivery range.... Note that I have been ordering from this store since I moved in 3 years ago. My place is less than 10 minutes from the store, about 3.5 miles up Mt Royal Blvd. 

They eventually called back and said there was a driver coming up that way anyway and they delivered it. Mind you after this time it had been like 30 minutes out of the oven by the time it even left the shop. I told them I'd pick it up if they made a fresh one but refused. They made sure to mention any further orders through the app would not be delivered."}
{"text":"Waited 3 hours for a delivery. On a Tuesday. This place is run by hood rats. Trust me, go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Came into the location for a pickup order and wasn't even greeted.  The cashier was counting down her drawer and barely looked up at us.  The cook or manager (not really sure) came up and bagged our order and gave us the wrong change back.  He corrected himself when I said something but then we got home and the food was also inccorect.  Not a good experience from start to finish and have had bad experience at this location before.  Will not go back."}
{"text":"By far, the worst pizza hut I've ever ordered from. It's bad enough that Pizza Hut is making smaller pizzas, and giving fewer toppings these days, but this place is just horrible, even by that standard. Nothing but kids working here, and the pizza you get has barely any sauce or cheese or toppings on it. I will never return here again."}
{"text":"RACHEL SAVES THE DAY!

Second time ordering from this location. I ordered online tonight at 7:45. An hour and a half later haven't heard anything about my cheesey goodness..... I called in pretty ticked With the service, come to find out the driver delivered my order to someone else.... I was really surprised with ms Rachel. Very well mannered and kinda made me feel like a a$$ for being so heated. She apologized, and took care of me for the slip up. This review is only on Rachel's behalf. Someone pay her a little more! Thank you Rachel for your professionalism:)"}
{"text":"We are regular customers to this pizza hut... and time and time again we are soooo disappointed !! They can not seem to put what you order on the pizza.. nor do they cut or bake it properly at all! Tonight, they delivered the pizza as they were closing- so the one pizza that was supposed to have veggies had none! And of course since it was delivered after they closed, no one would answer the phone.  So sadly enough it was a bare pizza... at least at little Caesars you know the disappointment you will have by ordering there... here you pay soooo much more hoping for a better pizza and they can not even seem to EVER get your order correct! This is the 4th mess up in less than 4 months!!"}
{"text":"Wow!!!! Terrible service!! I placed an order online and after 35 minutes of waiting, I called for the status and they said it'd be out for delivery soon. ONE HOUR AND TEN MINUTES LATER, I call back and they said uh actually your card was declined so that's why it's sitting here. And they claimed to have called me 45 minutes prior to that. I CALL BS when I didn't get a call and even so I had called after that alleged call and wasn't told there was a problem. So the guy chuckles and goes did you want to put a new credit card on the order? NO. CANCEL IT. Won't be ordering from them EVER again."}
{"text":"I'm in the store now. 30 mins for a pizza carry out that I ordered on line. Waiting 10 mins. Phone has rang non stop and no one answered it once in the 20 mins. Lady walks in on her speakerphone and says I've been trying to call for 25 mins (pizza hut hold music voice over in the background. ). Waiting space is the size of a trash can and big kids play table takes up most of it. Feel bad for the counter worker, Curtis, maybe the owner Tom H (whose photo is inside) should hire some more help. Revenue would go up and your average yelp review would not be 2 stars. Got my three pizzas after 40 mins after ordering. Said it would be 30 but that waiting area is enough to make me never go back. And answer the phone!"}
{"text":"ONE star given for the young man that took over the Phn call after 10 mins of the gaL not knowing how to add toppings and charge ---other wise a big fat ZERO. 

UPPER management needs to step in. 
It was Wednesday evening and not a single event was taking place in town... This place was a wreck from the initial Phn order placement. 

Your workers don't know the physical address of your place. I wanted to verify or double chk (as an out of town guest) which store I had called and needed to pick up at ... due to delivery times being quoted at 1 HR 45 mins. 

Your business is 8 mins from my hotel (per Google GPS) and it took @45 mins of standing at your counter to receive my InCORRECT order. Thank goodness Starbucks was Nxt door the kids had dessert before dinner. 
The gaL at the counter is quick to collect the money but should check the boxes immediately and NOT after I waited an addiction 25 mins for an add on of MiLD Wings only to find out that my original order to include a personal pan pizza was made incorrectly.

I don't have any good things or kind comments to say about this business and my first experience with them ... and could write more negative ---but I think you get the point. 
***did I mention that folks before me (3 orders but who's counting) were given free wings for their \"wait\" 

They offered to remake my pizza (there was a 25 min turnaround time) 
My reply was; um... No thanks. 

I was told my card would be credited for the personal pan pizza mishap. The misMADE pizza wasn't given to me ... And the Exact dollar Amount to be credited was NOT stated."}

{"text":"My experience here was overall amazing so many bad yelp reviews but I was extremely happy the food was delicious and fresh and the employee were super friendly and nice good work guys"}
{"text":"I had a house full of hungry kids. Several times I have tried to order, but have been told they do not have a day time driver. REALLY! I have called months apart from each other hoping that someone would have been hired. I can see why no one wants to work for them. RUDE and unprofessional employees and management. They have no concept of customer service. The kids love Pizza Hut, but I will NEVER order from the FOREST HILL location AGAIN!!"}
{"text":"Delivery usually doesn't take too long. I order from this location from home and from work. 

My only complaint is that THEY ALWAYS FORGET THE FLAVOR ON THE CRUST
Like come on.... every time? So annoying"}
{"text":"Awesome service! Answered using their automatic service with my name. Gentleman answering phone was super accommodating and helped with my order. Service took a little long for delivery, but no longer than they said and delivery guy was very friendly!"}
{"text":"Quick, Inexpensive, and Convenient

Pizza Hut is always a good choice when your looking for something, quick, inexpensive, and convenient. 

I usually opt to pick up my order at Pizza Hut rather then have my pizza delivered.  However, I had a group of kids at the house and decided to go with home delivery. 

I ordered from the website and was given 45 minute ETA on a weekend  evening.  The driver was friendly  and showed up 25 minutes later. 

The pizza was hot, my order was correct, and the entire meal was inexpensive.   What a great way to feed a bunch of kids without leaving the house."}

I wish the staff at Pizza Hut were a little more customer service oriented and cared about the product they serve.  It always seems like you're putting the staff at Pizza Hut out when you ask a question or have a concern about an order.

I prefer the Pizza Hut located at 107th and Indian School Road they make a better pizza and are much more friendly with customers."}
{"text":"Good for a quick I expensive bite to eat.

I have always ordered take-out  from this Pizza Hut and have  never had a problem. My order is always ready for pick up within 20 minutes, and the pizza is always served hot and fresh.

The staff is friendly and accommodating  and make sure Im getting what I ordered,  what more can you ask for."}
{"text":"FRIKEN AWESOME!!! Pizza arrived right on time! Hot and Crispy! The delivery guy was nice eye candy too ;) ;) !!

I haven't had Pizza Hut in a very long time and it has gotten SOOOO MUCH BETTER!!! I got the $5 deal pepperoni pizza and brownie dessert and the 4 pack of soda, 16 boneless wings and the Hershey's s'mores cookie. The Pizza was loaded with pepperoni and so good! The wings were awesome and the deserts are gonna last me a couple of days and SOOOO WORTH IT!!"}
{"text":"This is only a review of the buffet (8.99$ AYCE). For what it is (greasy, delicious, American style pizza), it's fantastic value, and great pizza. You will feel incredibly guilty afterwards, but you'll probably be back some day if you live anywhere near it.

The place was crammed [with good reason] by the time we left at around 1:30 (it was a Friday, but I'd imagine it's always pretty busy for the buffet), and occasionally you had to wait for a pizza you want, but the counter-point was that everything was constantly hot and fresh. I keep kosher and so am effectively vegetarian when it comes to pizza, and I was delighted to find that they had a little under half the table dedicated to veggie options. They switched it up, too, throwing out different varieties of cheese pizza, different veggie combos, etc. There were generally 2-3 veggie options, which is better than I was expecting, and occasionally 4. They had a pretty basic salad, some sort of plain breadstick-y things (not bad, but they couldn't really compete with the pizza!) and a couple of veggie pasta options. One had a bunch of pizza-mozzeralla baked into it, which was a nice touch. They even had soup, which I didn't touch since I had no idea what it was (and was pretty happy with the rest of it). 

Service was good too. Not that it's too demanding to serve at a buffet, but they refilled my soda within a couple of minutes of it running low, and spirited the plates away fairly often. I even heard one of the cooks advising a customer (possibly a kid? I wasn't looking directly at them) not to worry, that another cheese pizza would arrive in about a minute. I definitely won't make a habit of eating here for health reasons, but if you ever want some AYCE comfort food, this is the cheapest (and as far as pizza goes, probably best) game in town."}
{"text":"I will never bother ordering from this store. I was put on hold and after 10 minutes they hung up. Goes to show how they do service. I guess virtual service is better who knew"}
{"text":"Ok, first off I love Pizza Hut pizza . What I don't like are the inaccurate delivery times I get from the store . I'm still waiting for a pizza I ordered 55 mins ago . . When the ETA is 35 mins . I'll could have drive for that matter . Don't get delivery from here . If u do don't tip ."}
{"text":"Ordered pizza from here today and i must say the food was decent the only reason they got 3 stars is because of the service the cashier was not very clean looking and the the restaurant felt packed with only 3 people in line . The place is tiny."}
{"text":"So I'm here at your Pizza Hut at around noon. And me and my best friend order a large stuffed crust pizza and drinks for dine in. When we get our pizza it isnt even cut the pizza all the way through. I just feel like this is pathetic because i used to run a pizzeria and this is unacceptable especially for someone like me that has a lot of passion for pizza and the pizza industry. So i will definitely never return to this location. And will gladly take my business elsewhere. Definitely not worth $16.19."}
{"text":"I ordered pizza to pick up here and it was ready on time not like other places that make you wait for ever all the toppings where the want that we wanted ,the service was awesome!"}
{"text":"If I could give this place 0 stars I would! Listen to the reviews and DO NOT come here. As we were eating I observed an employee wipe his nose with his bare hand and then proceed to box and cut pizzas with no gloves on and he did not wash his hands. Another employee that was building the pizzas was not wearing gloves. Employees would handle cash and credit cards and not wash their hands before going to handle the pizzas. Just overall so bad."}
{"text":"Ordered a couple pizzas and a bottle of water for delivery from the McKnight Rd Pizza Hut. My husband paid in cash and when he came inside I saw that we didn't get the bottle of water and the pizza didn't have all the ingredients on it that we asked for. When I called to have it fixed, some Pizza Hut operator told me that he couldn't get the McKnight store to pick up the phone and that more often then not they stop answering after 9PM because they don't want any more orders because the store closes at 10PM. That's fine except I wasn't placing a new order I was just trying to get the order that I already paid for! He told me I should try to call back the next day. Seriously? Ridiculous."}
{"text":"Several times I've ordered with this location... problems every time. Preciously waited ove two hours for delivery, called to check on it and was told it was en route. Called back an hour later and they told me I had called and canceled the order. 

Yesterday the pizza arrived not fully cooked with cold chicken as a topping.... soggy dough, cheese not melted. Wings (if you can call them that) barely had any sauce on them. It's better than delivery, it's Digiorno. Do yourself a favor. Order anything else from anywhere else and you will be happier."}
{"text":"Very dirty looking store delivery drivers hanging outside in in front of store all visiting talking smoking and making it difficult to get in not making it feel welcome pizza was raw and cold Mark is extremely rude and disrespectful and very un- helpful stay away from this location"}
{"text":"This Pizza Hut is terrible. I called and was on hold for 10 minutes, then they just hung up. Happened twice.  Their service couldn't be worse."}
{"text":"This is my first time at Pizza Hut. Shocking, I know! This place has been hyped to me on and on... to the point where my mind believed it was the most magical place on earth. So of course for my past cheat day, I picked this spot! Ordering is easy, as all pizza is. We ordered online and at this point I could already predict this is a place I wouldn't eat probably more than once a year. They offer tons of options that will lead to human depletion. 

We picked this combo that let us have a medium pizza and two sides. Of course we opted for our own toppings and I bombarded my side with pineapples of course. As for the sides, we chose boneless chicken bites and the Caesar salad. We went to pick it up and we were pleasantly surprised to see it was ready in 10 minutes! In and out, I drooled all the way home with the warm pizza in my lap.

It's very rare for me to eat pizza nowadays so I dug right in and yes it was delicious. Soft, warm and exactly what I expected. It was good, but did not blow my mind especially with all the hype I hear. The salad was insanely small for a regular- I don't know how this is a share dish. The dressing that came with it was probably heavier in grams than the salad itself. Thank goodness they don't mix it in for you.. the boneless bites were good. Nothing more to say than just good. After 2 slices (keep in mind these are the small square slices) and a bit of salad, I felt a huge stomach ache as it felt like my stomach was clogged. I felt super sick and heavy and couldn't continue on. 

Pizza Hut? Definitely overhyped in my opinion. Maybe it's because I don't eat this stuff often but I've never felt such pain eating pizza before so I don't know.. of course the food wasn't bad.. only the aftermath was."}
{"text":"Called to order cheese sticks for carry out...

They were currently out of cheese sticks, so I asked if they could make me a medium pizza with cheese no sauce and Carlos bread seasoning over it. As I was placing my order I was placed on hold twice. I arrive shortly after placing my order understanding I would have to wait. As I see the manager running back and fourth answering phones meanwhile making MY order herself. After paying I realized she ALSO gave me half off my order for the inconvenience of not having the original cheese sticks. 4 stars for being unprepared, but incredible accommodation for a first time customer. Goes to show was a great manager can do!"}
{"text":"Not sure where all the bad reviews coming from.... I've been ordering from this location for a very long time and I've never had an issue with them. I feel bad for all the rest of the people cuz my pizza was bomb!"}
{"text":"I have ordered delivery from this location several times over the last few years and it's not very good.  I used to love Pizza Hut Pan Pizza when I lived in Alberta, it was my favourite but since moving to Ajax I find this location seems to overcook everything.  The pizza and sides are dried out and over done.  I wouldn't mind so much if it was reasonably priced but it's quite expensive.   I hope they can turn things around but in the 4 times I've tried it's been quite poor each time."}
{"text":"Ordered the pizza online.
Email confirmation on the price was $29.92 and when the food was delivered found that my card was charged $32.92. So the driver decided to steal an extra $3.00 from me. Tried to call the store and inform them of what happened but the store clerk put me on hold until I hung up (well over 9 mins). Tried calling head office but they directed me to call the store as every store handles their own customer service. LOL...Do yourself a favour next time you find yourself ordering from this store...don't.

Sincerely Disappointed"}
{"text":"Sunday is all about Nascar in our house, been seeing their Pizza Hut commercial over and over for cheesy bites pizza! 

1:53 PM My boyfriend called in a carry out order for a large Pepperoni with creamy garlic sauce and cheese stix. We had a wait time of 15 minutes. Kiara was our server and she was new.  We were told they were sold out of cheesy bites pizza. So  I guess they cancled our order, nobody called.   Had to reorder the food.  Manager said they'd make us a cheesy bites pizza.  Our order came out wrong the second time.  They had to remake it a third time.  Third time was the charm and it took 50 minutes to get our food.

However even though we were hangry, I did see the cheesy bites pizza and cheese stix tasted great.  I appreciate the cook who loaded up the cheese stix with fresh cheese and seasoning. I could of ate the whole box, but didn't. :)

We live ten minutes away, the food was still piping hot.  Very delicious and they gave us a credit under the account for the next visit."}
{"text":"9:30 PM 3/1/15

Walked in to find it not busy. We're the only people here. It's dirty to me, there's mud everywhere & I had no place to wipe my foot walking in.  It's been raining all day, I doubt they mopped.

Alexis our cashier was not friendly.  I could not understand her at all, she was covering her mouth. Had a miserable tone & held no eye contact.  I didn't even know the total.


$15.12 for a Stuffed crust EXTRA cheese ($2).

Perfect location. Hated the service.  Food was hot & delicious when we got it home. 4 out of 5 rating for the taste.  I hated the service 2 out of 5."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery and was charged for our order. An hour and a half later the pizza wasn't here. Called four times no answer. Called help line and they couldn't get the store to answer. They checked and someone just cancelled our order and they didn't have the decency to tell us or anything. Thanks for charging us for nothing. All the help line could do was say call tomorrow and ask for the manager."}
{"text":"I would give this place NO stars.  My family and I were staying at a nearby hotel to this pizza hut and ordered a few pizzas.  The driver who took my order said I was the only order and it would take 60 minutes for 2 cheese pizzas.  Worst of all, when the pizzas arrived, they looked like they were dropped on edge a few times.  One of the slices on one pizza was folded over.  The other pizza had half of the pizza slide over to the other side so the cheese was missing from half of the pizza and the stuffed crust was wedged over.  How bad do you have to be to deliver 2 easy cheese pizzas?  Worst service I have ever had from ANY pizza establishment.  I am afraid to eat the pizza now.  I would warn all others to stay away from this place until they seriously make MAJOR changes.  The owner should be ashamed."}
{"text":"Told me a 25 minute wait,waited 40,still wasn't done. Finally got pizza,very hot and very disappointed. It was very sweet and just awful. So upset"}
{"text":"In the past, there were spans when I would order pizza WAY too often. Lately, I've been eating a lot healthier...though, I'm not made of stone.

Of the delivery pizza places, I like Pizza Hut the most. Their on-line ordering feature is extremely intuitive, allowing you to visually customize your exact order.

This particular location just so happens to be the one assigned to deliver to my location. In the short time I've lived here, I've always had pleasant experiences with the delivery people. They always seem to be happy, and are decently engaged. Also, they always seem to arrive early or on-time...which is kind of important.

All in all, the Via Linda Pizza Hut is a reliable choice for a decent pizza in my opinion.

If you're looking for a tasty break from the normal pizza, try a Thin Crust Chicken + Jalapeno...but be warned...I think Pizza Hut harvests some of these peppers from the center of the sun. Not ALL of them...but there are a few that make you sniffle something fierce."}
{"text":"Sheesh I've read all the horrible reviews that this particular location has received and honestly I've never experienced any of the following things other customers have thank god or else my reviews would be the same! Normally when I choose a Pizza Hut location I go to whichever one the Pizza Hut app sends me to! This location happens to be the best are closest to my parents home. Every order we have placed has been for pick up because I do believe they require like a 2 mile or more rule in order to deliver to your house or business. Once you place an order online it gives you a time when your pizza will be ready and everytime I've arrived at the time it's done, no complaints so far I hope they keep up the good work and customer service when I place my orders!"}
{"text":"A Brand new Pizza Hut literally down the street?! What more can a fat kid at heart ask for? This can either be a really good thing or really bad. I guess I will have to muster up an abundance amount of will power huh? I saw it during the construction phases and thought \"Yes God\"! However I am late with actually being able to give them a try due to this strict dieting I WAS on. I have to say that I was a bit apprehensive to visit due to the amount of negative reviews! I'm guessing they are still working out the kinks of being a new location. My experience was actually pretty good! I had a coupon that was sent to my email for 25% off an online order so I decided to use it. Placed my order online and received confirmation that my order would be ready at 9:59PM. Now I was testing them and showed up early (9:55PM) JUST to see if they would be on time and they were! In fact my order was already ready prior to me even arriving. Two employees working and both greeted me when I walked in, very friendly. My order itself came out exactly as I wanted. I will be back!"}
{"text":"I have this Pizza Hut a \"re-do\" because if I would've left a review after the 1st time I came here it wouldn't have been very nice.. However after having the bad experience I did I called the manger and explained that this particular location has to be one of the worst on the southwest part of town. I received a credit on my next order and decided to give them another chance since after all it was on them! Now even though my experience last night was better than the first I can't say that I would use this location unless I absolutely have to. My pizza's came out just how I asked and although I feel like they were extremely cheap on the cheese it satisfied my hunger! I think that most of the other bad reviews that you read about how slow the service is and the quality of pizzas that they prepare are 100% accurate! I will continue to use my favorite one located on Durango and Peace Way :-)"}
{"text":"I have had multiple cases of poor customer service from this location. Today I ordered a pizza that was made incorrectly. I called and informed the restaurant and after 5mins they offered to remake the pizza and deliver it. I was pleased with that solution. Moments later I receive a call from the restaurant offering a $5 refund on my next purchase instead of bringing me the pizza I ordered. I asked how a $5 refund would cover the cost of a $9 pizza and was told that actually the toppings that were missing would only cost less than $2. I found this to be a completely unacceptable response and informed the restaurant I no longer wanted the replacement pizza because who knows what they would have done to my food. Pizza is a dime a dozen you would think there would be some form of customer appreciation but since not here so they won't be getting any other business from me."}
{"text":"this Pizza Hut is great and definitely no worst then any other . their food is always ready, hot, and as ordered. We have ordered pizza from thislocation in Middleburg Hts for many years.  Very satisfied!"}
{"text":"Friendly Staff, Good Food, Hot Delivery; Rate This Among the Quality Pizza Places in the Area!"}
{"text":"I'm giving the place 2 stars only because the gluten free pizza isn't $20 like most chain pizza joints. Otherwise it's worth two stars. I didn't think it's possible to both under and over cook a pizza. The outer crust was burnt while the Center was so undercooked it was sopping wet. I ordered extra cheese, pepperoni, green peppers, and black olives. There was more sauce than cheese. And I counted only 6 pieces of pepperoni. And to top it off, the pizza want cut into slices. I was left ripping off chunks of pizza. Not a recommended pizza."}
{"text":"I was working nonstop and needed to get lunch.  I decided to order Pizza online and got directed to the Pizza Hut on N. Green Valley Parkway in Henderson.  I ordered the Large 2 Topping Pizza for $7.99.  I selected the Deep Dish Pizza with Tomato and Garlic Sauce. I skipped the Topping Drizzles but got the Parmesan Cheese Coated Crust.   

Delivery Time was quoted at 45 minutes to 1 hour but the driver got to my house in 30 minutes.  Pizza Hut charges a delivery fee of $2.50 but it does not go to the driver so I tipped him $2 in cash after I signed the credit card receipt.  Out the door the Large 2 Topping Pizza cost me about $13.72.  In my world it was SO WORTH THE MONEY.
This is one of the BEST PIZZAs I have had in a long time!  The crust was excellent. I
requested it slightly well done and it was cooked to perfection. The toppings also 
tasted super fresh....not like they were out of a can.

The only thing that seemed strange was that their website kept crashing as I was ordering online so I eventually had to call the store to order the pizza and make sure they had not double billed my credit card.  The Store Employee knew VERY LITTLE ABOUT THEIR ONLINE WEBSITE so I started from scratch with him and he gave me the online price.  

ALL IN ALL, AN EXCELLENT EXPERIENCE and will DEFINITELY ORDER AGAIN."}
{"text":"I went in for the all you can eat buffet lunch and spent over an hour and a half there. The pizza was about what I'd expect, but it was pretty slow coming out and there wasn't much of a selection."}
{"text":"Order to go all the time here, always good food from here. The manager that runs this store is awesome and very friendly."}
{"text":"DO NOT GO HERE. My friend had her phone stolen and we tracked it down to this establishment. We could clearly see her phone in one of the workers pockets but the management refused to help us. Don't plan on ever going here again!"}
{"text":"Me and my husband got the kids to sleep and decided to order some hot wings. Well they sure came. I ordered 20 hot wings just regular hot wings and they came fire wings. They burnt the inside of my mouth. I was starving and I had to eat some but it was the most uncomfortable dinner I had in years. So I call this location back and talk to the manager and he was rude to me and better yet, he did not set up to pick up the intense little package of wings and change them for me. So I will not order here again. Pizza Hut ruined my whole night and the manager made it sound like I was lying just to get more food. That was a terrible experience. I hope he dont treat others with that attitude. He needs to be demoted. Rudeness of a man. Sorry folks but if you want to burn your mouth literally do not order hot wings cuz they were sooooo hot even my Mexican husband could not take the heat. And it made our stumochs burn for atleast an hour. Just be very cautious about the type you want. They didnt say anything to explain how hot they were or they used the hot sauce that was old. Something went wrong and it was extremely intense. I work too hard to have such bad luck. Pizza Hut is failing. Ake care everyone!!
Love Mary"}
{"text":"Fist time getting food from here. Never again. We ordered a dinner box. The pizza was substantially smaller than I  have ever seen. All crust and no Sauce. Hardly any cheese at all.  one slice didnt even have cheese on it. And the bread sticks were cut at different sizes. Thanks puzza hut...."}
{"text":"We ordered our pizza at 11:22 and didn't get in until 12:22 and we ordered a thin crust and got just a normal pizza screw this place I intend on calling the store tomorrow.

{"text":"Ordered pickup online. Food was ready to go. Friendly staff and great customer service."}
{"text":"Never had an issue with a Pizza Hut before until the last order. It was a Sunday and presumably a busy one due to their special that day. We were taking advantage of their 50% any pizza special. Like usual we ordered 2 large stuff crust pizzas from online. They give us a pick up time which is usually on the ball or ready earlier. Pick up time was a little bit longer this time 20-30 minutes which is not a problem. We show up in 30 minutes to pick up the pizza and ended up waiting 30 minutes in the store for the pizzas! Another angry customer before us had waited 20 minutes and when he asked how much longer and was told another 20, he actually walked out on them. So we finally get the pizzas. Take them home and begin eating and the dough is hard and dry! Usually I have to dab the grease a little before eating but it was dry as cardboard. My husband was poking fun at the pizzas and comparing it to naan bread pizzas.  We called up this location to complain and the manager offered to either have the same order delivered or give us credit for the order. We opted for the credit as there were a lot of people in our party who had already eaten the pizzas we brought home and were full. The manager said he would save the 50% off deal so we could use thay again next time. That was great. Much appreciated.

Fast forward a few days and the credit hasn't shown up in my account online. We call back and speak with the manager and he says it is saved on the computer. It has to be used in store...ok...

Fast forward another few days and we call in and try to order pizzas again. We figure lets just repeat the same order, same deal. And here is what finally tipped me pver the edge to prompt a negative review on yelp. Different manager says we can't utilize the same deal of 50% off and states he has no idea what the other guy told us. Now we are stuck paying in store prices because we can't use this credit online. After a bit of debate they were willing to honor the online prices because of our ordeal. We ask about the $7.99 two topping large pizza deal that is online. They said they are not a participating location for that promotion. Um..yes they are?? I had my iPad right on front of me! We ended up paying extra for our order to just use up this credit and definitely never will use this location again even though it is the closet one to our house. They don't deserve our business. Sometimes big chains forget how to provide good customer service. About to leave to go pick these up and they better at least taste like they should!!"}
{"text":"The pizza was overcooked and had a funny taste to it. This is the worse Pizza that I have ever brought at Pizza Hut. Ate two slices and threw the rest away."}
{"text":"This is a pick up location only, there is not restaurant here. 

Being that you can only pick up your food here and not eat there is not much to say. This review will mainly be about the food. I have ordered many times here and find that the pizza is usually consistent in its quality, so is the pasta. Two if may favorite things to order from here. The best thing to do is to order the food through the app on your mobile phone and them come pick it up. This will save you some time. 

The staff can be friendly if you want to engage them in some small talk while you wait, however, I recommend you use the app on a mobile phone as the transaction is much faster."}
{"text":"I decided to give this Pizza Hut a second chance and they did much better the past couple of times.  Was having work done on the house and ordered pizza for the workers.  Asked for a specific time for the delivery and both times they delivered just before or on time.   The delivery staff was friendly and brought the pizza warm and undamaged.
   The new pizza with the choice of crust and drizzle are very tasty.  The Buttery Garlic crust and Balsamic Vinegar drizzle are my favorites.  The pizza is pretty standard but the Buttery Garlic crust and Balsamic Vinegar drizzle make the pizza pretty special.  Pizza Hut's prices are easy on the wallet also so I got to give it to the on the new style pizzas - definitely knocked one out of the park."}
{"text":"I wish I could give this place 0 stars. I live right around the corner and this place can't figure out how to deliver my order in less than 2 hours. The only reason I've ordered from here more than a couple times is because they are literally the only pizza place that delivers to my new-ish apartment complex.

On one particular occasion, the delivery guy hands me my pizza, huffing and puffing like he just ran a marathon and I say \"you know it's been 2 hours since I ordered...\" His only reply was \"We busy.\" ...clearly.

Tonight, I tried again. It's been over 2.5 hours now. I've called twice. Never got a person on the phone. Listened to the automated hold message for about 15 minutes total. Ended up grabbing some Taco Bell. Never received a phone call, still not sure if a pizza will arrive tonight or not."}
{"text":"I will rate it one star because I ordered a box on a Thursday night it got here in 45 mins that was a good thing the only problem I have with them is that when receive the pizza it was cold and the pasta was barely room temp.  warm and when I called to speak with the manager I was on hold for 16 mins and when he answers the phone I started to speak and asking him questions as soon I start telling about the pizza he couldn't hear me anymore idk what's wrong with them and playing these games"}
{"text":"Im sorry but the lady mamager who works there had the audacity to tell me only 1 of my pizzas i order was wrong. Who the fuck are you tell a customer that only 1 pizza is wrong. Im not fucking blind i can tell when my order is wrong. But no she just kept saying only 1 was wrong if anyone knows her name please let me know because her corporate bosses are about to get an angry worded letter."}
{"text":"Horrible customer service they don't know anything about customer service. They let people cut in front of you when you order online. It doesn't matter if they had already paid with in store or online order. The pizza is good but the service sucks I will be ordering from a different Pizza Hut such a shame since its only 2 minutes from my house."}
{"text":"I saw an ad boasting pizza huts new menu, sort of like Dominos' overhaul a couple years back, which was needed and I liked.
So I wanted to give Pizza Hut a shot having not liked them compared to Papa Johns and Dominos. I ordered 2 mediums 2 toppings for 20 bucks, delivery, including tip. I got a chicken and bacon pizza, and a pineapple ham one, hand tossed style, with the new flavored crusts on each, cheddar on one and garlic bread on the other; new idea. Poor execution, the pizza is just flavored wrong, all I tasted was the sauce which is too tangy/garlicky. There's hardly any cheese and the dough still is more cardboard than it should be. There was hardly any bacon on my pizza, it was more like bacon bits. I was disappointed. 

It got worse an hour later when I was restricted to the toilet for about 47 minutes with uncontrollable diarrhea, and then had some puke spells at the same time. My buddy had only one slice of the chicken bacon pizza and texted me that he also was experiencing a similar stomach disaster. 

I waited about an hour and called Pizza Hut. Asked for the manager and waited for 10 minutes to talk to some guy who could barely speak English. I didn't want a refund, I really didn't want a new order, I only called to let them know there was possibly an issue with their chicken or something. So this guy who could barely speak english and claimed to be the manager, hurries me through my little anecdote about pizza and my butt and stuff, hehe, and then tells me to send an email. An email? To who? Idk, he didn't or really couldn't explain, language issues. And so I'm trying to make sure he knows there could be an issue with a product in his store, and he just keeps repeating \"email, email\" . 'Uh um, whatever then' . He hangs up on me. Hmm, I was laughing to myself after the phone went dead. 

My pizza ended up in the trash, and so will this Pizza Hut location if this is how they conduct their business regularly. 

Avoid this place, trust me, even despite my experience here, I realize that's something that could possibly happen and is unusual, but just based on the pizza quality. It's shit compared to any other pizza place there is, including Little Caesars, for real."}
{"text":"Each thing here is a struggle. I was here 10 minutes before someone took my order. They only have two people out front. Waited 25 minutes for one personal pan pizza. Just. So. Slow."}
{"text":"Pretty good. This have a nice buffet and good food. This location has done in if you wished. Also has a separate room maybe for parties and larger events. Delivery times are quick"}
{"text":"What can say...this place sucks..let me counts the ways.

Order was over 40 minutes late...waited one hour and 40 minutes...

Of course the food was cold when I got it, bread as hard as a rock. pasta was dry and crusty. Any experienced driver or staff member would of noticed this and re made it...says allot about what goes on in this store. 

The driver got lost, seriously...hire someone that speaks ENGLISH and knows how to use a GPS.

The receipt said I was a new customer been ordering from here at least 7 years via my earlier reviews since 2008.

 Took me a week to get a hold of the manager who would give me a credit for the shit service and the shit food. Used the credit for pick up, gave it to a homeless person...never eating here again."}
{"text":"Worst pizza I've had. They don't make it like they used to. Everything looked like it it was slapped on with out care no pride what so ever.  no parmesan cheese & peppers"}
{"text":"This is absolutely the worst place to order from. They have extremely long wait times for delivery. I called at 8:40 to ask where my delivery was, the woman who answered the phone lied and said ' the drivers car broke down'. Mind you I placed this order at 7:18 pm. Then I called back at 8:50 and a rude man answered the phone and verified my address and said that the driver rang my doorbell (which he did not) and my phone number on file is wrong. That is why it was taking so long. I was absolutely livid as the woman who answered the phone before lied and said his car broke down. After I exchanged words with the man on the phone he hung up on me! I called back and told him where to go. They are a bunch of liars and I will never order from them again!"}
{"text":"Pizza was decent. Service was excellent. Very friendly. I even asked to change my order a few minutes after and they were more than happy to do so. Excellent CS by the staff at this location."}
{"text":"Horrible.  Perhaps Canadian Pizza Huts are different?

Took over an hour to deliver pizza to my hotel room located 200 yards away.  When it arrived it was cold.

Went in a few days later to order carryout and it took forever.  A couple came in to order a pizza, nobody came out to help them, they waited about ten minutes then left."}
{"text":"This was definately the worst Pizza Hut I have ever had delivery from. First of all, they were out of pan pizza! I'm not sure how Pizza Hut can be out of pan style pizza but I guess they were having a bad day! We ordered a hand tossed instead and it tasted like it has been hand tossed into the trash, pulled back out and served! The pizza was cold, the crust was extremely dry and the toppings were dried and terrible. I don't know what they did to this pizza but it was horrible! The funny thing is that it didn't even take very long for it to arrive and the breadsticks were hot. Maybe they bake the pizzas a couple hours in advance in anticipation of a rush!"}
{"text":"I ordered dinner online last night, it was supposed to be delivered at 635. Around 7 it was still not delivered. I called  to ask where my order was, the woman i spoke to told me it was on it's way, when i asked if there was a reason its almost a half hour late  she replied with ' yea there is, we had 14 other orders\" to which i replied, well it would be nice to let your customers know. Around 730 when my order was STILL not delivered, I called back (which took  4-5 phone calls for someone to pick up) to cancel my order. I got the same woman I said since my order still isn't here i want to cancel, she said no problem, to which i replied it is a problem she said it was canceled and that was the end of the conversation. No apology or anything. Very Very rude service, this pizza hut has always had bad service but our son loves their food and it is the only one that delivers to us,  Needless to say we'll be taking our business elsewhere."}
{"text":"Ordered a large Meat Lover's w/ jalapenos and onions.  Delivered late (by an extremely apologetic, polite driver), grossly under-cooked and a rude woman on the phone when I called to check on the pizza's status.  You'd think I'd learn."}
{"text":"Classic Pizza Hut. Good if that's what you like (luckily I do) but this location is horrible. I've ordered several times and live 8 minutes away via driving. Every time it has taken over an hour. This last time took nearly two hours from ordering. 

Probably won't order from here again."}
{"text":"Gotta love 50 cents Wing Wednesday...smothered in their signature sauce of your choice. I love the spicy Buffalo Burnin' Hot wings. It's so spicy it will make your head spin. Just the way I like them. 

We also ordered the Super Supreme and Meat Lovers pan pizza which was loaded with toppings. Great Pizza Hut locations."}
{"text":"The worst pizza hut in town! I've ordered from this place for about 20 ,yrs the last couple years the service has been worse and worse they are under staffed and under I.Q'd ! We decided to get pizza delivery tonight after about a year I couldn't remember why we quit ordering from pizza hut, now I remember...2 hrs later no pizza so sorry only  2 people here on a Freakin Sunday night?!?!? Pizza Hut SUX!!!!!!!NEVER AGAIN!!!!!! For the record, ZERO STARS !!! NEGATIVE FIVE STARS! Just wanna say when we cancelled our order we orderd from Dominos it got here IN 20!!!!!! And it was FIRE!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I ordered the 8.99 special for a medium pizza for my little cousins. The special with two toppings, Medium pizza. (online only) 
And when the guy came, he was supposed to give me back my change. for a 20$ 
he explained pretty clearly that he'd grab some from the car, and ended up driving off. 
Worst experience. It was my first time ordering from them. Absolutely disgusting behaviour. 

Will not order from Pizza Hut ever again."}
{"text":"Worst Pizza Hut for delivery, even if you live close.

I called the call center at 6:57 pm and finished the call within minutes. The nice call center rep told me it should arrive in about 30 minutes. At 8:10 pm, I try calling the location I know it comes from directly and they didn't pick up after 10 rings. I call the call center back and let a very lovely customer service rep what happened and she puts me on hold to call the store and a few mins later, a nice woman from the store picks up and she asks her manager wtf is up and where the driver is. The pompus manager takes the phone and tells me that they received my order at 7:30. I tell him that's impossible because I called at 7. The pompus manager insists that they received the order at 7:30 and asks me to give the delivery guy 5-10 minutes and I accept that like a chump. He got here a few minutes afterward and it was fucking cold. I know it's cold outside, but the manager was clearly full of shit. $42 later with a good tip (don't think the delivery guy was to blame here, rather the awful management), I'm done ordering from these people. No discount, nothing. This was the second time they screwed me. Never again."}
{"text":"Ordered the personal hawaiian from this location. Meh.  I've had better at different locations.  The cheese-dough ratio was not upto par.

Ordered 8 boneless bites and I've never been so disappointed.  For $9 I expect it to, you know, taste good. But it didn't.  You could literally taste the flour that was mixed in the chicken part.  My advice to you would be to stick with the regular wings. When I order burnin' hot sauce for my wings, I still expect some sort of flavor too, is that really too much to ask?

Pizza hut use to be a much sought after, rare commodity in my life when I was a child.  My parents would never buy it cuz it was so expensive; and they were real estate agents. In 2007, I got a job and purchased a calzone/panzerotti from them, and it was garbage.  However, I discovered that the personal hawaiian was spectacular.   There was like, no sauce in the panzerotti; it was very inappropriate.  The cheese-sauce-dough ratio was not upto par. It fell short, and then fell into the garbage can.

Serve me right for going there after a workout.  I wasted $16 for this  foolishness.

3 stars!"}
{"text":"If bland, cold pizza delivered as much as 90 minutes after you order it is something that brings you joy, by all means give this place a call for delivery. If you also like tomato sauce sporadically slopped all over the place with neither it nor any cheese existing in random spots on the pie, you're really in luck.

It's a sin that this one of the only pizza delivery places in the downtown Phoenix area so far. Thankfully it's not the only one."}
{"text":"Where do I begin with this awful, awful restaurant?  The problem with these combo restaurants is that one of yous can ruin the customer experience for all of yous.  And that's exactly what happened today. I wouldn't set foot in this combo restaurant again.  Today I wash my hands of KFC, taco bell and all of their affiliates; except Pizza Hut. I can't quit pizza hut; they're too next level.  If you ask me, they should cut all ties to inferior restaurants like KFC and taco bell.  

I purchased the BLT zinger with a fries supreme. It came to over $10. I expected a succulent chicken patty with lettuce, spicy sauce, bacon and relatively fresh bread. Instead I received breaded chicken scraps with a pale tomato slice and one measly slice of bacon (likely from an underweight baby pig) and some sauce carelessly squirted on the edge of the box.  There was no lettuce and barely any meat at all.  $9 people. That's equal to 4 junior chicken sandwiches at McDonalds and 790% more meat than this stupid sandwich. The bun was untoasted yet, very crunchy Cuz that's what happens to super old bread and the \"chefs\" did not seem to care.

Also when I got my l fountain beverage cup, I went for the Pepsi and it was all syrup.  The place was so messy and everything was sticky.  I told the cashier that there was no lettuce in my sandwich and he was not surprised.  His eyes said what his lips could not: \"I know and don't care.\" 

This place killed all interest I'll ever have in KFC.
Before i consider returning, I demand restitution in the form of an actual chicken patty with lettuce on a bun that has a trace of moisture in it.

Like, I can't even believe this is acceptable for a well known franchise.  Avoid this location at all costs.  Get the questionable street meat at dufferin station instead of anything from this KFC.  Also, the fries supreme lacks everything that justifies calling anything supreme.  \"Fries average\" or \"fries Meh\" is a more fitting title for these lack luster potatoes.  There was really no meat on it.  If your a vegetarian please feel welcome at this establishment as there is no meat present in or around the facilities. 

No one gives a damn

{"text":"If there were a way to do NO STARS then, I would choose it! They are some of the most clueless unorganized people ever. The last 3 attempts to order something there, they have been out of stock, gotten it wrong, or taken forever to deliver it! I wrote the corporation, and the then so-called \"manager\" reached out to me and gave me a $15 credit. I just tried to call and redeem it tonight, and they don't have any recollection or documentation of my credit. They are just absolutely terrible and I am NEVER wasting my time there again!"}

{"text":"Ordered a pizza last night for pick up and they said 20 mins. We live close by so we left right at 20 mins. Get there and they try to give us the wrong pizza. The next guy had the same thing happen to him. As they are trying to figure out what happened they realized they never made our pizza. At this time like 3 other people came in and their pizza was made wrong or order messed up too. We waited there almost an hour for 1 darn pizza. Like 6 people were waiting, one after the other order after order, messed up. We were like the 2nd ones there but the last to leave. For the inconvenience, they did give us the pizza for free. I would consider ordering from them again in the future. Oh and they did call another guy to come in to help because they were slammed. Points for quick thinking however!"}

{"text":"The triple treat box is DOPE LIT 1HUNNA BANGING etc. For 32.99 you get 2 medium pizzas, 8 boneless bites, breadsticks, 2 dips, and a Hershey's skillet cookie. I came here with 3 squad members and we left pregnant. PLEASE for the love of all that is good upgrade your crust to cheesy crust because trust me girl shit b mental. We got the super supreme and grilled chicken rustico. Despite my love for all things supreme, i personally liked the grilled chicken rustico better. The pesto tomatoes were fresh and you know homegirl is trying to get fit for 2017. Overall the food was alright, but I really can't nitpick anything negative because of what a deal it is. Moreover, the man who waited us was a middle aged Asian man who I suspect is the manager/owner who provided terrific service--overall super cool A1 kind of dude."}

{"text":"IDIOCY BEYOND BELIEF. 

First and last time I will ever go there. 

Went to pick up a pizza that I ordered online. I was a little early and while waiting I noticed a sign on the wall that said if I was not satisfied they would either 1) Make me a new pizza right away or 2) give me a credit right away or 3) refund my money from (owners name,which I don't remember) next to a picture of a smiling owner. 

Evidently, The owner has to be there, in the store to physically give you the money from his pocket.  Completely stupid experience followed. 

The pizza was brought out from the kitchen and it was wrong. I did not want to wait another 20 min so I said \"Just give me my money back and we'll call it a day\". The employee got the manager and I said the same thing and he said he could make me another pizza  or give me a credit for another time but he can't give me my money back. I pointed out the sign and reminded him that he was the manager. This went back and forth way too many times. Now I'm getting annoyed and I told him to phone the owner. He went to office and came back to inform me that he had phoned the district manager who would try to contact the owner and if they phoned back with approval, he could then give me my money. I told him to phone again and get this issue settled, to tell his boss that he has an angry customer that is insisting on his money. He made another phone call then returned with a vendor pay out slip for me to fill out with my name etc and then gave me my money. ridiculous."}
{"text":"Sorry wish I could rate the food, but three strikes and you're out. Tried to order online through the app and it wouldn't work (kept asking me to agree to the terms but there was no where to select that) then tried calling, couldn't get them to answer. Then just showed up at the store and waited five minutes but couldn't place our order and we noticed the in store prices were different then the pricing online. Didn't know ordering a pizza would be such an ordeal. So were taking this as a sign that the pizza Gods are intervening and we shouldn't have a pizza tonight. Probably will give papa johns our business tonight instead."}
{"text":"OMG!!!  Here we go Again. Another one of my bad experiences.  Maybe I should just review \"ALL\" of the bad places here in  Clark county.  We drove to B.C. Last week to go get some rock gut Pizza Hut pizza. What a giant mistake that was. First off, we were the third couple in and within five minutes the place got a ill packed. The waitress took our drink order first and never seen her or the drinks for over five minutes. I almost  walked the six feet  and served our self's.  Mind you, this place/room is only the size of a 7-11 so, you can get from one place to another in 2.3 seconds. The waitress was nice but,  she was the only one running so I can't  blame her. The real big problem that we had was with the \"where's Waldo\" punk kid trying to be chef boy rd. ( we did notice Waldo screwed up the other tables pizza that they sent back ) I need to back up for just a sec. We ordered bread sticks as a appetizer hoping that we could kill the hunger pains for just a few Min's but....no!!  I made a bet that the bread sticks will show up with the pizzas.  Guess what?? Yup, I won that bet.  When Waldo brought out all the food I said: wow, it would have been nice to get the bread sticks before the pizzas.  Waldo looks at me and says: SORRY. I said: sorry? That's all you got to say?  Wow...hey Waldo, SORRY, I forgot to pay the bill...or sorry, I forgot to leave a tip!!  I was trying not to look like a dic* let alone be one but, hey. Really??  Sorry is all you got?   What a let down.  I know from now on, I will never step foot in this place again.  No wonder the good ole dine in pizza huts are almost extinct. It's from crappy service that we received from Waldo the wanna be pizza maker.  Way to go Waldo....your gonna probably close one of the last sit down pizza huts.  ( I  will try to upload the pics of the cardboard they brought out to us to eat. )"}

I called at 2:10 and hung up at 2:12.... at 3:10... still no pizza so I called. The \"manager\" said the guy came and nobody was home.INCORRECT as my husband is sitting inside waiting and nobody rang the doorbell (yes my doorbell works... I checked!) when I informed the \"manager\" that we were here and waiting he said he would send the guy out again to redeliver. At 3:30 pm I call back very frustrated and the \"manager\" informs me the driver left again. However nothing shows up... later still my husband calls and the \"manager\" informs him he cancelled my order because I said one swear word when I was frustrated.  Never ever again will I order from this establishment. Worst decision ever... should have stayed with Dominos ... I will be contacting corporate tomorrow about this horrible franchise. So much for pizza for lunch  on Mother's Day."}

It's 108 degrees out, we called to see if we could have the pizza delivered out to our car so we didn't have to take the kids/toddler out into the heat.... not to mention we were ordering a large order and that's hard for one person to carry with babies..... so we call and ask, can the pizza be brought out to the car.... the answer... YES! So we order... $50 in pizza.... go to pick it, call like they said too when I arrive.... pizza hut says sure we'll be right out.... as I'm waiting my husband calls me, he's the number on file for the order.... says Pizza Hut doesn't want to bring it out to you now.... so I take both kids out, go in.... two young girls standing in there.... I sign for the pizza and proceed to struggle carrying it out.... as I try to open the door carrying 5 pizzas with my toddler and young kids.... they proceed to laugh! Didn't offer to open the door, apologize for not being able to do what we asked when we ordered..... I'll drive he extra mile for papa John! I'll never give this location any business..... way to go Pizza Hut!!!"}

After wandering on the streets for a good five minutes I got scared and decided to walk to Pizza Hut to asked the employees if they would be so kind to take me in. They said yes with open arms. Everyone was very nice, one guy even offered to take me back in his Charger... But I politely declined.

5 stars for keeping me safe and warm. I'll never forget you guys!"}
{"text":"This pizza hut is horrible! I've had a couple of bad experiences with being called out of my name by delivery guy. Another incident a delivery guy brought me a pizza that had been dropped and all smashed together. The last incident, which I only was ordering because the little one wanted it, I was told they don't deliver out where I live, since they moved across the street. Which was a lie because I had been ordering from there since they moved across the street. Pretty soon they will have to shut down. Horrible!"}

I just had an order of their hottest wings and they were not really hot but the garlic Parmesans did not disappoint . Pizza was cooked to perfection, no dough spots at all, perfect portioning of toppings and cheese. Wings and pizza for 5 for $22. Obviously we have all had a better meal , but for the money the quality is great. Value, convenient, courteous , and free plates and napkins to go with it, win!"}
{"text":"I've ordered here before without much problem. Honestly, I've become more of a Pizza Hut fan lately, so, good for them for winning my business. Today, they showed absolute failure. 

I ordered a pizza at 12:21 for delivery at 2:15. (I think that is a reasonable request)
I have no problem with the online experience and I've have pizza a few times from here and I've been happy. 

Like I said, I ordered a pizza at 12:21 for delivery at 2:15 which I think is pretty reasonable.  I was called at 1:49 that they we unable to deliver the product. Specifically they could not deliver that kind of pizza. I was told that they could not deliver a pan pizza because they ran out of pans, and if I want something else. - Now some times this may be OK but when you have guests expecting a certain kind of crust it isn't.  I asked the person on the phone \"how does this happen?\" I then received a scoffed, condescending, and most unintelligent response of \" uh because we ran out of pans\"  - That was not the right answer and clearly he isn't the right person to be representing the brand. My response was to ask for the manager and this is where I understand the root cause of the issue here. 

The manager, who took a very defensive and very un-apologetic tone, begins to tell me (paraphrasing) how I can't get product that I gave them hours to take care of.  I tell her I'm not happy and then stop her, re-introduce myself, and tell her we need to start over. I tell her let's make a way to do this right... and before I can finish she HANGS UP ON ME.  I've been now apparently black listed, AFTER we had to call back to confirm if indeed the food would be delivered or not. A young male stated that I had a \"bad attitude and didn't understand what it means to run out of something\" after claiming he \"didn't like my tone when I called\", when in fact the store called me. Quite frankly they couldn't get their reasons straight, which I now believe are excuses. First he said they ran out of pans, then crust, then product, so WHICH WAS IT??. I can only imagine I was not the first to receive this type of service today, from people who were disrespectful and unbecoming. 

I expect an apology from Pizza Hut and strongly recommend that the employees be fired or severely reprimanded for purposely and negatively representing your location and tarnishing your perceived standard of service and excellence. If not then you can expect public protest at this store and constant social media outreach. I feel after giving multiple chances to this store to make it right, I am justified in this anger. BBH FOOD Game on!"}
{"text":"Consistently bad service. I'm done giving this place a chance. It takes at least an hour and 15 minutes to get your food (most recently clocking in at 1h40m). They WILL screw something up. And they will NOT show any remorse or do better the next time."}
{"text":"Called to see what the specials were and left a pick up order. Was told about 15 minutes. Once there, realized that this place is for pick up or delivery only. They person at the counter was really friendly and my pies were ready. 

Pretty inexpensive at only $14.00 for 2 pizzas loaded with toppings. Great deal after moving from California where one pizza is easily $ 25.00.

Pretty good pizza too. Give it a try if close by."}
{"text":"If there is a no star option, I would give it a NO Star!  So I have ordered twice at this place from to be delivered at my job so, we can enjoy Papa John's. At first I thought the pricing was a little bit much with a 30% Off Large Specialty Pizza. I get there is a delivery charge and paid almost $25 with tips included.  I called to ask for a prize and it was way less than the one I ordered that had supposedly the 30% Off.  I spoke to the \"General Manager, Tim\" and asked why would they send fliers of discounts if there are really no discount.  I wanted to speak to someone who is in charge of this location and he said that they are in the east coast. I ask if there is someone who is in charge in their region and said no one is in charge of their region...BOLOGNA! Needless to say, I am never ordering here ever AGAIN or possibly not even eat Papa Johns EVER as well!"}
{"text":"After a long debate, my tired girlfriends and I decided to order pizza hut for a late lunch/early dinner before hitting the strip. Terrible mistake in choosing Pizza Hut for delivery. Called and asked if they had any deals with pasta (one of my girls waned chicken alfredo), and they offered the $20 Big Box deal, which included 2 medium pizzas, breadsticks and the pasta. Delivery was estimated at 45 mins. Everything sounded great! 

Or so we thought. 1 hour 45 mins, still no pizza. We called to complain - the manager offered us a sorry $10 off our next purchase coupon as compensation. When the delivery guy finally arrives, he has no pepers, no parmesan and NO UTENSILS/NAPKINS, even though we had a pasta!! Unbelievable. The pepperoni pizza and mushroom pizza were not what I envisioned - we had no idea it would be this weird square pizza, and for some reason the crust was unusually greasy. The breadsticks tasted off - hard, stale and flavorless (and came with no marinara, of course).

In short, this was a horrible idea and I advise you never to make the same mistake I did. Stick to Dominoes for delivery!"}
{"text":"Freaking pick up the phone! I call many times no one is answering!!!! What's going on?! I understand there is ahead of me that you are helping  but waiting for half an hour this is not acceptable!!! And drop my call two times!!! Really!!! Worst customer service!"}
{"text":"Bad service, didn't bring us plates never asked if we needed refills on our drinks. Nothing but kids working there they were just talking with they're friends. Didn't have one care for us as paying customers"}
{"text":"Horrible ! The delivery at this place takes forever and my pizza is never really that good . I ordered delivery yesterday evening . I was quoted 40 mins , my pizza didn't arrive until a hour and half later ! Called the Pizza Hut to check on my delivery 24 mins after my quoted time was over, I told them my pizza is going on almost 30 mins over my quoted time , he said it's actually been 20 mins , that was so rude smh anyways by the time the pizza delivery guy came it was indeed 34 mins over time ! The guy didn't really seem that concerned but hurried me off the phone stating that they will give me a free pizza in the mail , YEP , and click . Customer service needs a lot of work . Will not be ordering from this location again ."}
{"text":"Our delivery order came quicker than expected, order was correct and perfectly delicious!"}
{"text":"ordered from this location sunday to pick up since was at john c lincoln hospital. when i got there smelled and saw this delivery drivers car. one was a cocky kid and this big guy whos car was being held together with tape and lights was off heard arguing in the back. so i walked out and canceled order horrible customer service."}
{"text":"I haven't ordered in a while but felt like pizza tonight. I do order from this place because it's convenient. But I think I'm over it now. I ordered tonight and after waiting for over an hour I called to ask where the driver was. They ended up canceling my order. I ordered online and it's been a while so I didn't update my card and it declined. They called before payment but the problem is, they must have called the wrong number because whoever answered said they didn't order a pizza. Before you cancel an order, you should probably check the number you dialed especially when the person claimed they didn't order a pizza. I double checked my number on the account and it's correct so I have to guess they dialed wrong. Thanks Durango Pizza Hut."}
{"text":"This is the worst Pizza Hut I've ever had. Every time I order from here something is missing or they don't arrive for about 2 hours every time  n my food is cold. When I call n complain they say they will reimburse me on my next order..just to make another order for the same thing to happen n they say they don't have anything saying they owe me anything. So far they owe me two 2 liters of pop. And a whole new pizza considering it was cold when I received it. And i still have not got reimbursed. Never order from this location. Horrible horrible horrible. Plus the service gives u an attitude when u call n complain. Like look u need a whole new staff Bc they all suck at their job!"}
{"text":"Just wanted to update my review from a 2-star to a 4-star. I'm thinking maybe this place just has an issue with deliveries. Just ordered takeout and the stuffed crust was perfect. The wings were piping hot. The girl that gave me my food, Jamie, was the nicest person ever. Will recommend."}
{"text":"I'm not a huge fan of chain pizza places, but after having bad luck with some of these Mom & Pop places in this area, I ordered from them, and I've done so about 10 times now.  I've only had an issue with slow delivery once, it was only about 15 minutes past when they said it was supposed to arrive.  But I ordered once again today.  The pizza was decent.  I got some wings, which were good.  I've never had an issue with the food not being hot and fresh.  All their delivery drivers seem nice and friendly and none of them have ever called me having issues locating the place as others have.  They've also honored any coupons that I've used (most of them on-line deals I've found).  I'll never say Pizza Hut is the best pizza in the world, or is anywhere close, but when you need delivery pizza and consistency, I'll take them over Papa John's or Domino's any day of the week.  By the way, I've used the on-line ordering every time, and have not had any issues with incorrect orders."}
{"text":"Just got two of the new pizzas with pretzel and a chess are crust. Also,Parmesan garlic wings...and the chili wings. There was more,but these items stood out. The pizzas were the worst I have ever had from any Pizza Hut,and the wings had little flavor. Whoever owns this franchise needs to do something about this pathetic food."}
{"text":"Use to always like Pizza Hut. Recently poor experiences here...

1. Ordered online, arrived at store and paid, proceeded to wait, front desk clerk went in back, came back and took orders and gave out pizzas to people behind me according to the order chart, asked, repeated whole process, about 20 min later told me they never even made my pizzas!!!

2. Delivered to house last week, delivery guy didn't have any change...nothing!!! Might be a tactic these guys utilize to make sure the tip is larger. Regardless, didn't feel like messing with paying with credit so just left with a large tip....but also in turn left with never getting my business again

Pizza is standard pizza hut, but service here is lacking on a consistent basis"}
{"text":"We ordered a pizza a little after 5. Paid by credit card and got confirmation of the ordered. They showed up 2 hrs later and said that the machines are down and we have to pay cash. Oh and they won't take a $50. The manager Terry or something was a rude and unable to help us. So we waited 2 hrs for nothing. We will never order from this place again."}
{"text":"The pizza delivered was warm not hot as you advertise in your commercials. The cheese was really thick and lumped together so I had to put it in the oven and cook it a little more. I ordered the meat lovers pizza and it looks NO WHERE like the pictures you advertise. I can count the pieces of meat on the pizza. I haven't ordered from Pizza Hut in a while and now I remember why. I think you need to take notes from Jets Pizza!"}
{"text":"Their customer service is awesome! I usually order carry out since I live pretty close and I just get great customer service every time I've gone. Their food is what one should expect, it's Pizza Hut, so it's as good as that goes. They always have me check out the pizza before I walk out with it to make sure it's correct, and are good about offering their sides (Parmesan cheese, crushed peppers, napkins, etc.) This is a great location! Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"do not order wings from this location. I have order wings 3 times and they taste like chemicals with no sauce. I have order wings from other locations and they are always covered in sauce. The service is average for a Pizza Hut but if you ask for a refund because the wings have no sauce, they will argue with you and not give it to you. The manager even said to me \" do you want to see our measuring cup for the wings?\"  Poor service and poor wings."}
{"text":"Received an email after placing my order online stating a 38 minute delivery time. After an hour I called the restaurant only to be told there was a problem and my order could not be processed. There was no effort made to contact me and no apologies offered. Manager of the store was \"too busy\" to get on the phone and discuss with me. In a city with many choices when it comes to pizza delivery, Pizza Hut has lost a costumer."}
{"text":"Brings back so many childhood memories! Pizza Hut should really build more of these, because who doesn't love a buffet of every kind of Pizza Hut pizza??!!"}
{"text":"Ordered the garlic knot pizza.. There was no effing garlic it was just crust type balls stuffed with the nastiest plain cheese so pissed and disappointed. The manager was a total douche bag he insisted he cut and boxed the pizza himself and that he personally added the butter and garlic with the Parmesan on top.  Then said rudely next time I'll slather it in butter if you want. See the picture there was not a trace of garlic. No smell nothing and that Parmesan?? I will be contacting corporate for this rudeness and lack of customer service. I've been a loyal customer since the 90's and have never been disappointed no matter the place, city or country. But this is ridiculous. Oh, I should mention he offered store credit. Why the hell would I want to return to a place where the customer isn't right. I would appreciate my money back!"}
{"text":"Update, we called the corporate number to try to get a refund. Because this event happened on a Sunday, I had to leave a message. A week later no one has returned our call. I cannot believe a popular chain such as this provides this despicable customer service. Will not be doing any business of the sort with this pizza chain again."}
{"text":"Ordered online from here because the good places were closed. I was hoping the pizza would be at least hot and edible, but wrong. They were about 20 minutes late delivering the pizza, which would explain why it was cold. unfortunately it was also somehow dry AND undercooked as well. Sweet! I ate half a slice before I gave it up and threw the rest back in the box. 

My boyfriend will likely finish cooking the damn thing and eat it for lunch tomorrow.

Breadstick were a little soggy but edible. As another reviewer noted, the breadstick sauce was the \"best\" part, and even that wasn't all that good. The only positive thing about ordering from here, was that they had a special for $12, with $1 going to the Shade Tree, for a large any topping with breadsticks. Too bad they suck."}
{"text":"I learned a big lesson!  I should have steered clear of this place.  20 minutes late with a pickup order is horrid.  

When is the management going to get it.  Your restaurant's service is less than average.  

When I called the person who answered phone played stupid."}
{"text":"Shelly here is awesome! Every time I go in with my son she is so friendly and interacts with him. Even when we only go in to get his free pizza for being a good reader in school. She'll never rush him, engage him in a conversation and is generally very friendly."}
{"text":"I don't know how this location does it, but they have the best lunch buffet of any Pizza Hut I have ever been in!  Keep everything replenished and hot!  There biggest problem is running out of plates because they are so popular!  Look forward to eating here every chance I get!"}
{"text":"Called in for a pizza delivery said they wouldn't deliver because we were too far and too call the closest Pizza Hut. Told them that the closest Pizza Hut has run out of dough. Asked if there's any way they could deliver as we were having a party. They said no and hung up on us."}
{"text":"Undercooked pizza, can't count to 8 for boneless wings - then you call for a refund and what happens?  The first time, they hang up before you even say a word.  Second time, ask for a manager get placed on hold for 8 minutes and 49 seconds to have someone pick up.  No apology and after nicely explaining the issue he hangs up.  Call back and have a (finally) very nice person answer (Melinda I think) who said she will get the GM because she was told the call dropped.  Jerry/Gerry/Gary the GM gets on the phone.  At first, he won't tell me his name and then relents.  He goes on to explain regarding the hang up that \"now a days\" they have to coach the staff and he will try.  Asked for my credit card number to refund me and when I said I ordered online he exhales - I said Sorry Gerry I know it's tough on all of us...he goes on to complain about how he has 25 pizzas to make, he's been doing customer service for 50 years, etc. etc.  This place is terrible.  I won't bore you with the other details of the food problems and phone call.  Just stay away.  So many other places - why did I fall for the coupon.  Let this place CLOSE!"}
{"text":"When I tell you there is not a worse Pizza Hut in the United States of America, I am being 100% serious. 

After ordering a carryout order consisting of 3 pizzas and breadsticks at 11:00am, and patiently waiting until 11:45am to pick up the order, I expected to be able to go in and out of the Pizza Hut and happily enjoy a pizza.

But this Pizza Hut was on a mission to ruin my day. As I walked into the Pizza Hut to pick up the order, they claimed that they could not make the order due to a lack of bacon. Yet, only ONE of the pizzas had bacon on them. They chose not to make the ENTIRE order because of bacon bits. They made no attempt to call, and I was forced to sit there for 40 minutes as they made the rather simple order.

If there was less than a 1 star rating I would give it."}
{"text":"Always fresh and on time and never been sick. No place is perfect but never had w problem"}
{"text":"Worst service times I have ever heard of. I have had to cancel my last 3 orders due to service times of 2-3 hours. An honest question... in a booming economy would it not make sense to have more than one delivery driver. Their driver totaled his car on the way to our house 30 minutes late. While this is not his fault the least they could have done was call and inform us our pizza was not going to make it. I called in and was informed they only had one driver and they could get the pizza to me in 2 hours. Absolutely ridiculous. Horrible management."}
{"text":"I never order online but I alway order in person and the wait time is always been 15 mins., my order have been right so far so my experience is great and on time. I have been here for the twentieth time and no issues, I will be back again."}
{"text":"I will never order delivery from here again! Called and they put me on hold without a \"hello\"! Called back and they couldn't even find my order & when they finally did they said it was on the way. No it was not! It took over an hour to get my pizza and they are just down the street! I am immobilized at home after right foot surgery. I hate ordering food for delivery for this reason!"}
{"text":"I love thier pan pizzas so much. They do make em great."}
{"text":"My coworker got us pizza from here. My cheesy pizza was good but his pepperoni pizza gave him instant food poisoning :( I love pizza but cant say I feel comfortable returning here."}
{"text":"Staff here are very professional and fast! They are always busy at this location and seem to handle the pressure very well. 

The manager here is super nice and will to do what ever she has to ensure the customers satisfaction. 

They always have great specials that they offer here. If you like to either pick up or get your pizza delivered you really cannot go wrong with these people."}
{"text":"Having grown up with Pizza Hut, I was hopping to get the same taste as I had when I was a child. Made an online order. Order was ready when I arrived, but service was not so good. I paid and then the guy didn't say anything. So I thought my order wasnt ready. So i stand to the side. Then he calls me loudly and puts the pizza forcefully on the counter, with the box opened and the contents about to spill out. (Box had many contents inside. 

Ordered a box with half a panoromous pizza, chicken bits and cinnamon roll. 

Pizza toppings were not spread out evenly. Most of it was just dough and cheese. Overdone/ burnt. Found a hair in it as well. 

Also while waiting and paying at the counter, since the kitchen is open. I could see the employees throwing things/ utensils around the toppings area and fooling around. They didn't seem like they cared.

Other than the food being ready when I arrived, not the experience I hoped for."}
{"text":"customer service helped us alot and they really fixed the problem thank you for the great assistance and really changed my pov about pizzahut as a company thank you!"}
{"text":"So this is our neighborhood pizza hut.  Been ordering  food from this location for a really long time and like a tradition,  always on wing Wednesdays. Today we get one of out orders wrong. They delivered a wrong wing type.  Called the store to inform them of the mistake and to request the correct item. Now this is where my opinion of customer service and \"taking care\" of a customer comes in.  Any other establishment would have apologized and either offers a partial refund,  a notation for a discount on the next order, or offered to redeliver the correct item.  The manager,  Alberto, instead decided to have a tone as if I was trying to pull a fast one and lying.  Kept reiterating that there needed to be exactly 8 wings or I couldn't exchange them even after being told that we didn't even open them.  We already had another pizza orders and coming so he sad he would send the replacement wings withe the new order . The delivery person arrived and inspected the wrong wings and counted each one and took  the wrong ones with him.  In all my years of customer service,  in a service industry,  had I witnessed this type of customer service. I'm just blown away. And it's not the fact we didn't get to keep the wrongly delivered wings its the way he decided to handle it. Definitely left a bad taste in my mouth.  Good thing the pizza and wings didn't.."}
{"text":"Received my food cold and hard as a rock ten minutes after I posted the review. Apparently the driver \"grabbed the wrong bag\". Upsetting and I probably won't order from here again. Pizza Hut has really let themselves go over the years."}
{"text":"STAY AWAY ! I ordered a simple dinner box. It never got to me. I waited for an hour I called the lady said it was on delivery and I waited 10 more minutes I called back and a guy said they cancelled my order because I never answered. They never called me to even try and notify me. Bullshit fuckers made me waste an hour of my life waiting for a pizza That never came. FUCK YOU."}
{"text":"Since this is the nearest pizza hut to our place we( me and my frnds) keep opting this when we like to eat light and a different tasty food. Buffalo chicken wings are too good. Even hot burning wings cudn't make me feel enuf spicy :P ( trust me my frnds were craving for a pop while they ate these , so better go with medium) but these are really good along with a pizza. Sometimes they give some deals which will be very worthy and the delivery time to house is jus so perfect on time.

But if u go to the business, u dont have much place to sit and dine. Very small place. So opting for home delivery is a better option. 

I wish this pizza hut wud provide ketchup along with pizza .And only pepsi products will be served for pop which I dont like as I dont find my fav coke in their freezer.

Pizza options are very limited. I think boston pizza has more varieties than this place."}
{"text":"This was the best pizza, but in the last 6 months something has changed and not for the better. The last two times we ordered the pizza was not good at all. I doubt we will ever order from them again. We are disappointed to see such a great place close by take such a bad turn in a short period of time."}
{"text":"Literally 3 min away from our apartment complex and they don't deliver. Bull shit, we are drunk college students and need delivery. Still good pizza tho"}
{"text":"DO NOT EAT THIS !$@#. $40 worth of two specialty pizzas and they cant get the crust right and leave off the bacon from a pizza that has it as a main ingredient! 
 Lovely. Thanks guys. The pizza was a request from a customer I was trying to impress. He specifically asked to add extra bacon. I specifically asked to add extra bacon. I paid extra for the extra bacon and confirmed that I paid for it on the reciept. Not a shred of bacon on a pizza that has bacon as a main ingredient. Thanks a lot, assholes."}
{"text":"I would give 0 stars if I could. 45 minutes after placing order online I called to find out what happened to my order. After the phone being answered directly to hold and being on hold 5 minutes I got a human. She aked to put me back on hold. When I said no I'd already been on hold 5 minutes she put me on hold anyway.  Don't expect to get anything from this location"}
{"text":"The amount of incompetent demeanor and general negative interactions I have had with this pizza hut are insurmountable. The entire staff of this establishment are rude uncaring self entitled people with no work ethic to be heard of just bad business practice. Stay away"}
{"text":"Horrible service, I ordered a carryout pizza at 6:47pm I did not get my pizza until 7:55pm. The waiting area was full of other people waiting as well. 

A guy that came to the front area said it was his first day training as a \"manager\" and that their was no manager there to train him, he also said that a few of the workers came into work late. WOW, I would not recommend this location to anyone. Go someplace else."}
{"text":"Every time I grab a pizza from this location (because it is so close to my home), the service is very poor.  The last time I ordered here one manager lady was eating and must have been on a break, and only one other girl was making the food and cashiering.  It took five minutes after being seen for me to be talked to.  I ordered wings and barely any mild sauce covered them. When I asked the girl to put more on, she rolled her eyes and went in the back. This was right after she handled my money! No hand washing occured.  Today I went in to get a pizza and the same girl was handling money and going to the back to make food. Time to call the health dept..."}
{"text":"C'mon - who doesn't love Pizza Hut. Still really good pizza fast, just the way you want it. At their price point now you can get a whole pizza for the price of a combo meal at other fast food places. This location is always on the ball and is quick."}
{"text":"Well placed an order and was told irt will be ready 15 minutes. It was a personal pan and an order of cheese sticks. Very small order. 30 minutes later and it still is not ready. Seriously. Not to mention not getting an apology for the wait either."}
{"text":"Every employee that works at this Pizza Hut needs to be fired. They give you long quote times to keep you from ordering (2 hours!) and then keep you waiting longer than that (I waited 4 hours!!) I never got my pizza because they lied and said they came and called me 3 times so they left. I went up to the store to get my pizza and they screamed at me saying that I was trespassing and that they would call the police!!! What?! They never made my pizza, they were hoping I'd give up because of the wait time. No apology or anything. When the police got there they made them refund my money!! They wouldn't even do it voluntarily. It's rediculous that you have to get the police to get them to refund your money. All over a freaking PIZZA! DONT GO HERE. Because if you do, you're going to end up calling their corporate office because they're horrible. Hopefully their corporate office will fire \"Kissie\" and the other woman with dreads and an ugly attitude!!"}
{"text":"The pizza itself is pretty good,  but the delivery service is terrible. They are always late showing up.  Last week I ordered 2 pizzas for my family an hour and a half before we had to leave the houseand was govern an eta of 45 minutes.  1 hour and 5 minutes later they finally got there.  I called to complain since we had enough time to pay for the pizza and set it on The counter before leaving. No one had a chance to eat. I was told they were short handed and they were sorry and would credit my account so I could get free pizza next time. Fine. 

So today I called at 1030 to order my pizza and was told they would be here at 1145 - probably giving me a long estimate because it's Friday and they know they were late last time.  This time they show up at 1205...unbelievable.  we're never ordering from pizza hut again."}
{"text":"This Pizza Hut used to be on point delivery times were on time or very close to the promised time ordered pizza at 3:41 I was told 30 to 40 minutes here we are an hour and 15 minutes in still no pizza I called to ask when my pizza left it left about 10 minutes ago I literally live 5 minutes from this Pizza Hut location if it's going to take an hour say an hour if your backed up say your backed up then I the consumer can make the choice if I want to wait or not straight garbage customer service and the prices now are outrageous I'd order online but your online ordering is horrendous not all options are available and if you call in to order it it's double the price or more ridiculous"}
{"text":"This place is awful dont waste your money go somewhere else. delivery took almost two hours and pizza was cold. Not to mention my order was wrong. I used to work here many years ago i hate to see this franchise go down the toilet. DO NOT ORDER FROM HERE!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Almost at a loss for words with this review.

Ordered pickup. While waiting inside a person from business next door slams the door open and goes on about needing someone to come next door and make people leave their bathroom. Most of the crew leaves. Keep in mind I haven't been greeted yet. Ten minutes goes by and apparently the situation was resolved.

The manager (?) finally acknowledges me. She, while nice, shouts everything. Not sure if it's a hearing issue or something else, but definitely annoying. Most of the crew returns to standing around.

Destiny, a crew member (noticed her name for the following), was the saving grace here. She was upbeat and very nice. Made sure my order got rushed along and was made perfectly.

Got home and the disappointment continued. Hut has gone \"gourmet\" in the recent months. I encourage this normally. Problem here is that the food had zero distinguishable flavor. I mean I know I was eating pizza, but everything blended together. No toppings stood out, nor did the sauce. 

With all the competition around this place, we won't be back."}
{"text":"I no longer will ever been going to this Pizza Hit again. I ordered my pizza and they said it'll be done around 10:15. Okay great. We order wings, bread sticks and a large cheese pizza. We get there to pick up order. Wasn't even done. I was standing at the front and a guy named Alex (older gentleman) looked at me a couple times and didn't even come to help. Totally ignored me. It happened about 4 times all from different people. So I was getting really annoyed. We waited for another 20 minutes before our pizza was even done. The lady who helped was a total waste of time. She has no idea what to do. So I paid finally for my pizza. Left. Got home and the pizza was just terrible it was cold the crust tasted like crap and the bread stick were absolutely disgusting. Never will I ever be going to this Pizza Hut again. Every time it has been a horrible experience."}
{"text":"It's good pizza, my favorite is the stuffed crust. Nice treat every now and then. The store is one of the smaller locations, no sit in, but I usually order delivery anyway. If you order delivery in the note section you can put please bring cheese napkins Peppers all that and it's free just make sure you note it though, they don't usually bring it unless you put it in the notes section or apartment section. Out of all the major pizza chains I like the dough at Pizza Hut it's consistently good. Papa John's is pretty good, but for some reason their sauce gives me heartburn. The Pizza Hut sauce is nice like a normal marinara sauce it's really good. For the most part, the staff here is good. I signed up for the rewards program the email thing and I get a lot of good deals on the app and online. For some reason the store doesn't have the same coupons online if you call them or go in person, so order online and you'll save a lot more money. Plus if you order it online it counts it and after you order enough you get a free pizza. I like the price of free, who doesn't lol"}
{"text":"Worst service and pizza!!!  Just ordered Chicken BBQ and I got something totally not Chicken BBQ.  So I called them to let them know we got the wrong pizza and they keep hanging up on me.  I didn't even get to tell them.  I just said I got the wrong pizza and they keep telling me to hold then hangs up.  My favorite pizza is Pizza Hut but not this location for sure.  If I can give -star I would."}
{"text":"Horrible customer service! I ordered pizza and quepapas and when I sent my friend to pick it up they told her they didn't have quepapas which i understand not very location has everything but instead of calling me back and telling me that they made me pizza rollers. I did not want pizza rollers. Worst case scenario they should have told her when she got there and said they made pizza rollers IF she wanted that. They charged me for something we didn't want and they didn't give us a choice if we wanted it. They without my knowledge charged my cc for something I didn't order. Bottom line they stole from me. I have called them over and over again for the past 20 minutes, 10 minutes after it was picked up and they have not answered when there are 4 people working right now. HORIBBLE!"}
{"text":"If I could give this location 0 stars, I would. I had ordered the $20 dinner box and was told my order would take around 40-50 minutes. Checked the website and it had said my food just left. I live literally 6 minutes away. I didn't get my food for ANOTHER 20 minutes. Once I had received my food I noticed I did not get my wings. Called the store 5 times, and counting from 2 different phone numbers and finally they picked up. The lady who answered the phone was rude and told me they would get my wings to me ASAP. End of the story, I was NEVER given the wings I had paid my money for. Never ordered at any Pizza Hut locations since, and will not be ever again."}
{"text":"Pizza as always, predictable good Pizza Hut. Need to find the deals or can be expensive. Good, friendly service for pickup."}
{"text":"Firstly, I want to say how much we had once enjoyed the great taste of Pizza Hut pizzas.  Although, for a pizza joint, they are extremely overpriced. To feed a family of four you are looking at spending between $30-$60; basically you could get better deals for pizza elsewhere. 

On our most recent visit, we ordered a pizza with pepperoni and pineapple. The order came with pepperoni and ham bits instead. We didn't realize the error until we arrived home. As a result of this error, we called the store to convey the error that was made; the employees seemed disconcerned and resorted to blaming us, the customer, that we had made an ordering error. Based on this experience, we decided that it was going to be our last time that we gave pizza hut any business."}
{"text":"I hate this location; the employees are so unhelpful  and rude. They refused to help me; 10/10 don't recommend"}

{"text":"This is the best Pizza Hut in town! I love the Wednesday night buffet. Food is always brought out hot and fresh, and most of the employees are nice. Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"This location was just the cause for an argument with my husband and I. I just ordered pizza waited for about 3 hours with alerts telling me the pizza was being delivered waiting and waiting and it never showed. So naturally I called the store the guy Who answered proceeded to tell me that my card was declined and that he tried calling me to let me know mind you I was right by the phone waiting for a call because I noted to call when the pizza arrived and not ring the doorbell since I have a newborn I never received a call also worried about my card and it being declined I decided to check my bank account and the first transaction was a charge from Pizza Hut as soon as I was about to call back and demand my money back the transaction reversed and they credited me the money back. This was all so unprofessional and I do not recommend this location if you can pick another."}
{"text":"EPIC FAIL for a business. I ordered online for delivery - 2 pizzas and wings. The pizzas arrived, but no wings. The driver said he'd be right back. Fine. But now I see one pizza is completely wrong. I call the restaurant. NO ANSWER until the third attempt. The girl on the line tells me my pizza is correct (despite me reading my order as stated on the receipt). She finally agrees to remake the pizza and send it with my wings. My wings arrive, but no corrected pizza. I wait. I call the restaurant back FIVE TIMES WITH NO ANSWER. She answers the sixth time after I *67 block my number. She then tells me I'll have to wait 90 minutes or pick it up myself. TERRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE. RUDE BEHAVIOR. DO NOT ORDER FROM THIS PIZZA HUT. 
(For measure... I ordered from a Pizza Hut in Corpus Christi, TX shortly after Hurricane Harvey. I had zero problems with accuracy or speed of service.) This Mattis Ave Pizza Hut is a disaster."}
{"text":"Christine is the best! I moved here in 2016 and occasionally order pizza, and when I do I prefer her to help of all the others that work there. The pizza is always correct and they keep my order on file, it's wonderful, for long days when I can't cook."}
{"text":"Today, October 28, 2017 (between 2:25 pm and 3:00 pm), I ordered a large pizza online but when I went to pick it up, my order wasn't done right, so the manager gave me a free small cheese pizza, which made my daughter very happy. Thank you.

{"text":"Waited 15 minutes longer than expected. Pizza, breadsticks, and chicken was cold had to reheat in my oven. While waiting for my order another customer returned three pizzas did not know why until I got home. I will not be ordering from here again."}
{"text":"I wish I could put negative stars because this Pizza Hut is beyond gross I went to the woman's bathroom was out of order I had to use the men's with my 3 year old the toilet had dried up poop on it the men's urinal had been filled with pee the smell was of sh*t and piss and the sink was coved with plastic bag over it I ripped it open to wash my hands I saw an employee go into there made me think they didn't wash there hands"}
{"text":"This Pizza Hut is nothing but disappointment. I believe it's the people that work there that really brings down the quality. My family and I will order pizza around the same time and day every time. Every time we would get pizza that is not made correctly. There is not a time when the toppings were on there that we ordered. We have gave many chances to them, but we have came to the conclusion that fast food chains plane out are a let down, and Pizza Hut on McKnight is not an exception."}
{"text":"I live 7 minutes away from their location. I've been waiting for over an hour and a half! The worst pizza delivery so far. I called the number they provided on Gmaps 5 times - no response. Emailed through the main website-nothing. Next time I'd rather walk 5 miles to the closest diner and it'll still be much faster... Minus 5 starts!"}
{"text":"I really wanted one of those heart shaped pizza for Valentine's Day so I decided to grab some for dinner for the hubby and I. I Placed my order online and it said it would be ready for pick up in 30 minutes. When I got there I was expecting to pay, pick up and go, however the food wasn't ready yet and they said it would be a few minutes. 25 minutes have gone by so I ask the guy working the front if my order is ready, he looks it up on the computer and tells me my order hasn't even been started. Of course I was upset , this is why I placed the order for pick up and not carry out because the wait time was longer. The guy told me that they will make it right now. Phones were ringing and not being answered and all the carry out orders were super behind. I blame management for not staffing correctly on a holiday and I know the workers were doing their best to get all the pizza done. However they could have done better too. It took 10-15 minutes for someone to help the people that came in to pick up their food, and I felt that the workers were trying to avoid the people coming in because they knew people were upset. Finally after another 25 minutes I ask if my order is ready and the guy says it's been ready. No one told me that it was ready and on top of that, I just got a regular pizza instead of the heart shaped pizza. I know the pizza is the same but I specifically came for the heart shaped and if they ran out, they should have mentioned it to me when I was paying for my food. If I wanted a regular pizza I would have went somewhere else instead of waiting almost and hour for my food. 
I also noticed that the workers don't wear any gloves when preparing the food. Is that normal? 
I was bothered by the fact they were making my food without gloves on. I'm hoping their hands were clean.. 
on the flip side, the guy who helped me did give me credit for waiting so long which I appreciated.
But I don't know if I want to come order food. Our pizza was super greasy, wasn't even cut properly and the pizza was blah."}
{"text":"I really love this place. We had a break and now we made up and it's better than ever. The storefront is clean, manager and employees have always been nice and helpful. A while ago I received a pizza with no sauce. And I've never had that issue again. I emailed corporate vs. calling the store, which was my mistake. I think if I would have just called they would have handled it beautifully. Corporate never got back to me. -.-

Be sure to use your pizzahut.com account to accumulate points, for every 3 or 4 orders you will gain enough points to get a free medium or large two topping pizza. Really worth it to me! Use that along with wing Wednesday hookup to get pizza and wings for about $5! You can't beat that anywhere. 

There will be your handful of homeless stragglers around, just enjoy the scenery and get your pizza."}
{"text":"I thought this Pizza Hut was fine. It's a smaller one. No eat in dining which is no big deal. Haven't eaten my food yet, but the girl on the phone was awesome. She was very patient and helpful. My food was ready when I got there and hot. I think some people just need to check themselves. A positive attitude goes a long way. I'll be using this Pizza Hut from now on."}
{"text":"Pizza is decent, price is o.k. but service is TERRIBLE and it's not just one or two of the employees but most of them.  I'd only recommend if you have a lot, emphasize a lot of patience and don't have a lot of $."}
{"text":"Have only been to this location once. Ariel was extremely friendly and provided excellent customer service. But the pizza was not quite up to par... couldn't quite put my finger on it but it seemed to be \"missing something\" which made it seem unlike the Pizza Hut pizza I know."}
{"text":"Really grungy and sad-looking Pizza Hut. We sat down to order but the server's BO was so distracting that we had to leave."}
{"text":"I like Pizza Hut but I absolutely HATE this location and I only live 5 minutes away from it. The store is always dirty, my order is almost always wrong and the food is completely inconsistent, you never get the same tasting Pizza or breadsticks which I don't understand. As much as I love Pizza Hut I actually started going to Domino's because this location is just too consistent and too filthy, I cannot justify giving this location my money when they refuse to correct any errors that they cause and or when there's an error with every single order and I ordered the same exact thing two to three times a week."}
{"text":"THE WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE EVER! They've gotten my order wrong every time!(6x) And then when I call to tell them, they try and argue with me! CUSTOMER SERVICE 101: never argue with a customer!!! How rude! And the wait time for 1 pizza is literally over 90 minutes and the pizzas not hot anymore. HIRE NEW PEOPLE PIZZA HUT THIS IS TERRIBLE"}
{"text":"The general  manager here should definitely get fired for his shitty customer service. I believe his name was Robert Harris.  Plus last time I got food from this location it was horrible and I found hair particles. Don't come to this location horrible customer service and very rude employees!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Pizza Hut is very convenient as its right around the corner from me. The Hut Lovers deals are also pretty sweet cause it gives me that urgency to order again. Delivery seems to be an issue if you pace an order after 8 pm it seems, there have been plenty times I never get my food, and I can't get through on the line to cancel. Pizza Hut is definitely serviceable though!"}
{"text":"Some of the RUDEST WORKERS I have ever encountered. If i could rate LESS THAN ZERO i would. 

Because I live in a new complex I now have to call in as opposed to ordering online. The workers are rude and abrupt on the phone. One lazy teenager hung up on me so that when the delivery driver got to me he expected we were going to pay in cash when I thought my credit card was on file because the kid never asked for payment. then my order was completely wrong. 

As a result we got a card for a free pizza in the mail so I again had to call to get my order. The girl on the phone couldn't get my address yet again so she gave me the manager who actually sent me the card. When I asked for my free pizza he was insanely rude and once we agreed it would be sent he said 'alright' and hung up on me. 

The kid who delivered my pizza was equally rude. As a former delivery driver who worked for tips and knows that my tips were often based on how pleasant I was I find being this rude to be insane.

It's pretty clear the people who run this store don't give a shit and I'm so annoyed that the only way I can get a pizza is to call them and that i can't order online.

\"GET YOUR SHIT TOGETHER CHERYL!!!!\""}
{"text":"I ordered Pizza Hut when a visiting friend friend mentioned it as a preference. 
I tried the pizza, wings, potato fries and brownie desert.
Each of the entrées was extremely salty and the desert was sub par to say the least. 
I did not care for the taste of any. 
I will happily continue to order Dominos."}
{"text":"As we leave this Pizza Hut today we will never be returning... we have lived in the area for around 4 years and have gone to this location many times as we love being able to dine in. 

I can honestly say that over the years this location has gone down hill and we are done! This is the second time coming in that the server greeting us is putting the disgusting YELLOW sanitizer towel back in the bucket from cleaning the table we are about to be sat at. Working in the restaurant business for years I at least know that anyone with common sense should know to THROW THAT NASTY THING AWAY! 

The last few visits we have been greeted with an annoyed \"are you dining in?\" My question is why would I walk in with my husband and 2 children under 3 and stand at the \"please wait to be seated\" sign for a few minutes if we weren't wanting to stick around!? Then after being seated we are expected to know what we are ordering within minutes of sitting down. 

Today after telling the server our whole order and hearing her yell at her co worker that the computer never works! She comes back to us to let us know that they are out of every single crust but Pan & Thin crust... on a Saturday night!? How are you out of almost all of your crusts on a Saturday night!? We politely tell the server thank you but we will just pay for our drinks and go elsewhere and she looks at us with a really confused and annoyed face. 

We love going to Boulder City for the amazing hospitality and food service that the City brings and this Pizza Hut used to be amazing but I feel no longer fit! Chilly jilly, pit stop & Foxs BBQ will be our go to! 

Pizza Hut you really need to do something about your Dine in locations or just shut them down and stick to delivery"}
{"text":"If I could persuade my husband to eat any other delivery pizza we would've stopped giving our business to this Pizza Hut years ago. 
Every time I eat here it's like dating an ex. I can't believe it really was as bad as I remember.
Today was one of these times. All my food was cold, my fries overcooked and my wings undercooked. This location is less than 3 miles away. 
The drivers are always kind and ordering online is fast and easy so I gave them two stars for that, but honestly, that is being very generous."}
{"text":"It had been several year since I have had PH Pizza. Especially IN an actual restaranut. 

The pizza was hot and fresh. We had a 3 cheese white pizza and an everything pizza. The alfrado on the white was too much for me. The everything pizza was good. Seemed better then I remember PH to be. 

The server was really cool. She joked and had fun with us. 

The prices were good. We had a coupon and she gave us a discount for a birthday that we were celebrating. Yeaaaa for me."}
{"text":"Terrible service. No one knew how to place an order including the manager Pete. This place needs new staff or better training."}

{"text":"Try disappointed. I have been ordering the same order for over a year from them. And some man on the phone said they could not do it.

I wanted all the veggies and chicken and he would not do it. Will not go here again."}

{"text":"So disappointed. I keep seeing the commercials on repeat advertising the new pizza and Spider-Man movie. And I tell you the marketing worked. It got me to order. But never again. It was like eating day old pizza. The mozzarella cheese bite crust had no cheese in them. They where hallow holes Bc the cheese ran out all over. Because the pizza was cooled down by the time it arrived it missed the mark completely."}

{"text":"I dont have a review on the actual pizza since my wife, my 2 children and I walked out after It took 20 minutes to even get a menu. We walked in and stood near the counter for about 5 minutes before we were greeted by someone other than the girl at the counter. they seated us and and we waited almost 20 minutes before we even saw a server, let alone a menu. Several other families were seated and orders were taken all around us  during this time, but we didn't get so much as a ,\"we'll be right with you\". Finally someone came to our table and asked us what we were having for drinks, but we hadn't even seen the menu yet so it's anyone's guess what drink products they carry here. We ended up walking out and down to the Marco's pizza just a few stores down and got a great pizza and awesome service. Best part about it was that it took less time to order and cook my pizza than it did to even get a menu in a nearly empty pizza hut. Too bad there's not an option for 0 stars."}
{"text":"Stay away from this particular Pizza Hut, way understaffed and the online order times are are way off.  You can expect at least a 30 min delay past your online quoted time.  Food was cold when I did finally ask about it. They just don't give a crap, other pizza places nearby with HOT pizza and better customer service."}

I understand that call volume and the number of orders is a factor, but I shouldn't have to wait an hour and a half for what is supposed to be \"fast food\". I will be sticking to Papa Johns for now on"}

I don't say any of this to knock this place as I will return again but probably not until I get a craving for a pan pizza which is Usually every 6 months"}
{"text":"I wish I could give zero stars. I had a credit for two pizzas which were made incorrectly on out last order. Pull up to the window to get our order. New GM who \"claimed to be the owner\" would not honor the credit. Said that it was over 90 days ago so he didnt have to. Extremely frustrating and then on top of that he was extremely rude and condescending. So, then after I pay I'm so angry I change my mind and want to get my money back and he says \"read the fine print on the back of your receipt, no refunds\". What a dick.

I told him I would never come back and he could care less. Total asshole, I hope his franchise goes out of business. Should never talk to customers that way."}
{"text":"It's a typical pizza hut except they have superb customer service. I've had my order messed up a couple of times where I shouldn't have waited (because I order online) and they've comp'd me pizza, drinks, and other stuff because of it. I appreciate the effort they put in to make sure everyone is happy."}

{"text":"So I made my order 7:15 PM for a medium pizza. The gentlemen said it was going to be 15 minutes. So we waited and the crazy part of this wait was everyone who orders after me was getting their pizza. I went and asked the gentleman what happened. He started to talk to the ladies in Spanish not knowing I spoke it. I over heard them say they didn't make it at all. So they said it'll be another 15 minutes by the time we got our order our food we ordered from the other place was cold. Wouldn't come back again! Made us wait 1 hour for some damn pizza. HORRIBLE SERVICE"}
{"text":"The pizza taste ok, cheese good Sauce good, how ever the crust and dough are just like break plain as can be and the pizza ordered traditional didn't ask for it the second time now paper thin, really trying to make their money I have prob 1% of the pizza I paid for."}
{"text":"Came here and got personal pizza,  it was very good, theres barely any seating like 3 stools"}
{"text":"Let me just say that I've never really been a Pizza Hut fan.  Their pizza is way too greasy and the bottom of the crust is always weirdly greasy and kinda reminds me of a fried sponge (not that I've eaten a sponge, fried or not.  But that's what I imagine it would look like... just soaked to death in greasy but crispy).

We went to Pizza Hut for brunch in Sunday before bowling.  Ordered a medium pepperoni and a medium supreme, a small order of wings and a few drinks.  This came to almost 50 bucks!  The pizzas there are very small for what you pay so I don't know how they can charge so much for such mediocre food.

The pizza was okay, I mean, I was starving so I can't really be that objective.  The wings were okay... nothing I would go back for.  I was really disgusted that we had to pay extra for a tiny little thingy of ranch to dip our wings in.  That's retarded.

Pizza Hut is just way over-priced for the greazzzy junk they serve.  If you like it I guess its worth it to you, but I won't be going back.  Morgan likes it, so she can go but I'd rather hit up Burger King across the street, or better yet, that Mexican market with all that grilled chicken they cook outside!  YUMMMMMMMM!

If I want pizza I'll pay extra for Riccobono's Pizzeria in Gilbert, where you get the extra bang for your buck!"}

I attempted the order online and it said that deal was not available at that location. I called the location and was told that they can't sell that order because they don't have the cookie. I asked about a substitute and was told that I could not substitute. I decided to order anyway so I went back online and ordered the two medium deal for 6.99 and added breadsticks. Once I got the confirmation I was told that delivery would take 2 hours! Are you kidding me? No I'm not going to eat at 9pm. Needless to say, once again I am not a Pizza Hut customer."}

{"text":"This location is great for having their AYCE lunch special, TV's, large dining area & good pizza, pasta & salad selection. 

On the food podium you will find Hawaiian, pepperoni, ground beef & vegetarian pizzas that are all pretty darn good if not greasy. 

When you are feeling like something sweet they usually have on hand 2 types of dessert pizzas. Apple cinnamon or cranberry \"pizza pie\". 

This time when I went, my favorite dessert pizza was absent...the Apple cinnamon :-(

The wait staff are attentive & friendly, the only thing that was missing from this lunch session was the Apple cinnamon pizza pie. Otherwise everything was well & in order.

Great all you can eat lunch in the 10 dollar range."}

Pizza Hut is the worst.
Methinks not"}
{"text":"Yes, it's a 4 star Pizza Hut.  I have ordered a few times from this location.  Somehow, the pizza is always made fresher or with richer ingredients than some of the other locations.  I love the Super Supreme, deep dish, and this location makes it perfect every time.    I made the mistake of ordering the same pizza from another close location one time.  it didn't taste as fresh, and the texture of the pizza was not as good.  So, I'm sticking to this location."}

I ordered carry out and it said it would be done in 25 minutes, so I show up and it wasn't close to done yet I had to wait another 20 minutes.
Normally I'd be pissed, but ANITA was amazing!! She communicated to everyone who waited and was working her butt off for everyone!
She gave me plates because she knew I just moved into my place.
The pizza was good. 
But my review isn't about the pizza it's about Anita who made my night less angry when I was tired and starving from moving all day.
Give this lady a raise most employees at pizza places are rude and I never really have many stand out experiences at any chain pizza restaurant.
Because of her I'll order again."}

Coming back much of it hasn't really changed, except for the fact that it looks small (perhaps I just got bigger lol). In addition the place was clean.
My buddy and I decided to have their \"2 can dine\" special.  This included salad, garlic sticks, and pizza.
Portions was sufficient and price was reasonable at $25 minus the soft drinks we ordered.
Overall, pizza hut is about the same everywhere. The service was good, and the staff is very customer service oriented."}

{"text":"The worst Pizza Hut we have ever been to, with the worst service. I came in to order a pizza and the person didn't seem to understand the order but said it will be ready in a little bit. I LITERALLY waited about half an hour for the pizza to be ready before they came out with the completely wrong order giving me a completely different pizza. It turns out that the person didn't even take the order right. They didn't really seem to care and made me order all over again even attempting to charge me again. After I re-ordered, again I waited about another half an hour with a different employee coming to ask us what pizza we ordered again and again. Throughout the almost 30 minutes we waited for our re-ordered pizza, all we saw were employees in the back playing around and not giving a care that they got our order wrong and made us wait so long. There was literally nobody in front checking up on us while we waited for our re-ordered pizza and instead kept asking us which one we ordered. They didn't even apologize for getting our order wrong or making us wait almost an hour at ALL throughout the whole time. A very poorly run Pizza Hut with absolute horrible service."}
{"text":"I honestly can't believe they have so many bad reviews.  We don't order pizza often and normally it wouldn't be Pizza Hut but this location is wonderful. The ladies are so friendly and the pizza is really good. Like good good not just good for Pizza Hut. Once they made a mistake on our order and just gave us a free pizza and re made another for us.  I like veggies in my side and they always load it up. Honestly it's the only pizza I want to order."}
{"text":"I have ordered from here multiple times and once the pizza man left after not even knocking on the front door. They went around the house to the back door, knocked, my grandmother walked to the back door but before she got there he left, then called my phone and asked if I ordered a pizza. I said \" yes \" and he mumbled something then hung up the phone. He ended up giving us our pizza after leaving then coming back."}
{"text":"One of the only dine in Pizza Huts left in Calgary, its flaws stem from low volume. It always closes its dine in way too early, before the advertised time, and we've had the server vacuum while we were trying to eat.

{"text":"My one-star rating is mainly because the wings from Pizza Hut are god awful and I want to warn people before purchasing them.  If you want to get a pizza from them, go right ahead, but steer clear of their selection of wings! 

A night or so ago I was having a craving for wings - and let me tell you Yelpers, it was a terrible craving.  I ordered Pizza Hut's medium wings and lemon pepper wings.

The first thing wrong with both types, was how they make/prepare them.  The wings that I drool over and always end up craving later are the kind that are fried or baked until the skin on the outside of the wing is crispy.  Then, obviously, they drown these wings in sauce and bam you've got yourself something to die for. 

Pizza Hut's wings?  They actually coat the wings in a very, VERY thick cake-like batter and cook them that way.  They then coat the wing in a select type of sauce (that is poorly made as well).  You go to take a bite and the majority of what you get is batter!  If you're lucky to get meat off of the bones, which I barely was, you get a thick flap of wet (not crispy) chicken skin and what appears to be STEAM cooked meat. 

The sauce they coat the batter in is anything but extraordinary.  The medium-hot wings I got had a super strong smell of vinegar coming off of them but little to no heat/spice level at all.  My lips didn't burn while I ate them and my tongue wasn't crying for a time-out.  Yes, yes, I know!  I got the MEDIUM ones but generally they have SOME heat to them, right?  Wrong.  Perhaps my taste buds are growing immune but the level of heat on the medium wings was just downright criminal.

I had high expectations of their lemon pepper wings, as those are my favorite kind of wings, but I turned out to be sorely disappointed.  They were horrific and this is what made it or broke it for me.  Clearly in the name of the type of chicken wings, there should NOT be a level of overpowering sweetness, correct?  I took a bite of a wing covered in what appeared to be a gooey sauce with specks of pepper in it and I was totally turned off.  The sauce was SUGARY.  I've never tasted lemon pepper wings anywhere where it tastes as though they put honey in it or some form of sugar.  I could barely taste the kick of pepper.  To be quite frank, I don't think they put any sort of pepper in it because all I tasted was the sweetness.  It tasted like someone slathered a battered up piece of meat in syrup.  If I wanted something like that, I would have gone into a reputable restaurant and ordered chicken and waffles. 

Needless to say, I am thoroughly grossed out and never touching anything 'wing' related by this company anymore.  Truthfully, I don't even want to touch anything Pizza Hut makes at all because this experience has not only left me feeling physically sick from the poor quality of the food, but it was expensive and a complete waste.  Never again."}

Not only is the delivery NOT arriving on time but the pizzas haven't even been MADE yet. Hey, Pizza Hut -- it's totally NOT okay to call your customer almost 30 minutes AFTER expected delivery time to notify them about something you should have immediately known when the order was placed over an hour ago, especially if you don't even attempt to apologize or rectify the situation. We were forced to cancel the order because of time constraints and my family wasn't able to eat dinner before my husband and I had to leave for work. We won't be back...ever. Fortunately we have a better pizzeria down the street that we will be ordering from from here on out: http://www.linospizzavegas.com"}
{"text":"The buffet is horrible!  They kept running out of food and had very few options. Waste of money."}
{"text":"This is the one and only Pizza Hut that I have been to that doesn't make pizza like every other one in the world. That being said, I have given them numerous chances to do better thanks to their proximity, $10 pizza price and lack of any other good pizza in town. 

The last time it was worse then horrible and they even had a offer for their new pizza stating that you would get a free pizza or money back, don't know which if it wasn't right. I ordered once and asked for no green peppers. Green peppers are something that even if you pull them off the flavor stays. I let it go because I seriously am so tired of having to complain. All I want is a decent meal. So, the next week I ordered again. When my pizza showed up with no black olives I called. I told them about the previous results and that I hadn't complained or requested the meal free as advertised. The manager told me that he would credit our bill by $10 and he never did. 

The time spent on the phone when all I wanted was the meal I ordered and for it to taste like every other pizza hut....

I ordered from the Pizza Hut on Watsons and picked up. Their pizza, while really over cooked, I was so happy with because it tasted like a normal Pizza Hut! 

I really wish they would allow you to contact the owner and let them know. They loose a lot of money by loosing customers. I went so far as to contact corporate only Pizza Hut about a year ago about this same Pizza Hut. They didn't bother to answer so it's pretty clear that they just don't care.

I remember back home, we would go 20 miles out of our way to go to the Pizza Hut and eat... Such a shame. You can not just get take out from the other location even though it's six miles from us because the website defaults you to the other location!"}
{"text":"We ordered my kids favourite pizza - Hawaiian with the home style crust from the Royal York and Lawrence location. We were beyond disappointed when my husband came home with a burnt pizza!! My kids came home from school and were hungry and had no choice but to eat the burnt pizza. They usually would have 2-3 slices each but that night they could barely finish one slice because they complained about how burnt the cheese was and how the crust was hard and dry. 
It's hard to believe that 'Pizza Hut' can't get their pizza right. The guy didn't give us our receipt or else we would have left them our feedback on the Pizza Hut listens survey. Won't be going there again !!"}
{"text":"This has to be the worst experience I have had with this location. I walked in to pick up my order and was told my order wasn't ready. Cool no biggie. I have now been here over 25 minutes when I placed my order online over an hour ago. The people they have working are letting the phones ring without answering and I haven't seen anyone since I came in. But I hear them in the back laughing and arguing. I haven't heard anything as far as an update to how much longer I have to wait. I hope the pizza is worth it."}
{"text":"At a local hotel. Called for a delivery and was told the wait was 2 hours minimum, because they did not have enough drivers. At 5:00 on a Friday."}
{"text":"First and last time I'll be ordering at this location. Rude employees. Hoping the food would make up for the terrible customer service but they messed up my order too."}
{"text":"Worst employees ever! They no joke messed up my order that I had delivered in some way or another 4 straight times! I called after the first time and was given a credit for my next purchase which they again screwed up. I've come to the realization that it is simply impossible to get a correct order from them, their brains just can't handle making cheap pizza. I will never order from them again and continue to tell everyone how horrible Pizza Hut is. Don't go here, just pick somewhere else.  Barro's delivers to this same area and it's delicious. Or go to Peter Piper Pizza which is right down the road."}
{"text":"My hubby and I used to order pizza every month from another location and when we moved to mountains edge, well we started ordering from this location. From day one the pizza was way late like an hour and \"cold\" what's with that? We live across the street!! We eat frozen pizza now can't believe tastes better than this Pizza Hut!"}
{"text":"This location did a much better job as far as the dough being thoroughly cooked. I got a veggie pizza and cheese sticks for the night, both were good, but for taste I enjoy DiGiorno more. Everyone was friendly upon entering, which I always like."}
{"text":"It would have been perfect except for the fact that my veggie pizza had raw dough. It came to be $27 and some change plus $5 I tipped the delivery guy, who was very nice, for a dinner I had to throw away. So my meal consisted of only the cheese sticks. Not ordering from here again."}
{"text":"Gross... just gross...
Pizza Hut was on my way home and I was hungry so I just ordered it. Came in and picked up my order, it was ready on time. Came home to find I had picked up someone else's order.   I want to be clear that it appears that the manager who was male picked my pizza order up.  It was not the cashier checking me out, it was not her fault.
I know I really should have checked before I left the parking lot but I was tired and on my way home from work and they were absolutely not busy, zero people there so I figured it was my order.  This lack of customers should've also give me a hint as to when I was about to get.   I decided just to eat what I had picked up because the toppings were OK but the quality of the food was just gross, like the worst quality.  No flavor, just blah.  I don't know if they have been going downhill since I don't here here often or it's just this one in particular but I will not be returning.  Ever!"}
{"text":"This facility is not the cleanest but the workers here are usually nice to me. I ordered a personal
Pan pizza and ate at the store. The tables needed to be wiped down and the dishes looked slightly dirty. I don't think i will be returning because of the state of the store. It desperately needs to be updated."}
{"text":"I ordered my pizza online at 7:30, got the confirmation via email at 7:35. All I ordered was one pizza, breadsticks and soda. At 8:40, and no pizza, I called them to inquire and they said \"We only have 1 driver, it should be any minute\". Pizza arrived at 8:50, but no breadsticks. I called back and was told \"sorry, we only have 1 driver, I can those out to you in 40 minutes\", and the pizza was slightly burnt. Cheese sticks came at 9:45. How do I get a bad pizza & late service because of their employee problems? Back to Hungry Howie's."}
{"text":"delivered on time and the wings (boneless, traditional) were great but the delivery guy looked like a hobo...no uniform, unshaven, holes in his shoe....I still tipped him but geez....at least dress the part...."}
{"text":"It's pretty ridiculous when you order a pizza and it takes an hour to show up. And it is pretty rude when you call and ask about your order and the employee just responds with \"They are already on their way.\" and guess what, it has been another 30 minutes and I still do not have my order. . . Horrible service."}
{"text":"Did you want a good pizza? Aaawwwwe...sucks for you then. We never have gotten a good pizza from here. They skimp on everything, especially cheese! We only order from here when we need delivery because the other (better) one is too far (on Pearl). If you have an option, go with pearl rd...or perhaps somewhere all together different."}
{"text":"Very greasy pizza, first time ordering from Pizza Hut, and it was so bad we couldn't even eat it. Service was good and fast delivery but the pizza was terrible. Will not be ordering again"}
{"text":"Either the server forgot to put in my order or the chef forgot to make it.  After several reminders asking her to check in my order, she finally told me that it was just then being prepared.  I cancelled it and recommend that customers avoid this location."}
{"text":"I couldn't really decide what I wanted to eat but I needed to get something. I was looking around on Yelp and decided on pizza. Since I'm by myself tonight I didn't want to spend $20 - $30. I decided on this place. I did a quick Google search for coupon codes and found that they have a 3 topping medium for $6. I placed my order online for a thin crust with pepperoni,  Italian sausage, and mushrooms on a garlic parmesan base with salted pretzel flavor crust. The website said that my order would be ready in 15 minutes. 

I arrived at the store 15 minutes later. When I walked in the guy at the register was counting cash but no other customers were around. He kept doing whatever it was for a minute or two, finished,  closed the register,  and walked to the back of the restaurant without greeting me. He seemed young but that's no excuse when a simple hello,  smile,  or I'll be right with you could make a customer feel welcome. Instead I felt like I was bothering him. When he came back to the counter he just stood there looking at me. I took this as a subliminal offer to help me. I explained that I had placed an online order and was there to pick it up. I gave him my name. He immediately went into a speech about the website and that it should have told me that there would be a 30 minute wait. I told him my pizza was confirmed ready for this time. He went back to his speech about needing 30 more minutes. I pointed to the screen on the wall behind him. It displayed my name with the word ready next to it. Upon seeing this, one of the cooks who had came from the back asked for me name again and grabbed it from the pizzas that were ready and waiting to be picked up. The cook opened the box so that I could verify that my order was correct. He even made a joke to try to salvage the interaction. This is the type of employee that should be dealing with customers. The current cashier needs to be retrained or replaced. 

The pizza was okay.  It was very greasy but I was able to blot it before eating. The only reason I come to Pizza Hut(about once a year) is the pretzel crust. It's delicious and the salt adds to the overall pizza flavor. 

Pizza from a corporate store isn't the best. The service at this location makes it even worse."}
{"text":"Not a good location
Customer service is *SHIT*
Food comes semi stale and lukewarm 
This is not the first time
Now please fix this you are losing customers fast and will continue to lose more."}
{"text":"Ordered pizza today and initially, I was bummed that their menu changed.  Surprisingly, both pizza's we got were better than any other pizza we have gotten lately."}
{"text":"Pizza is good most of the time. It used to be better about 7yrs ago. It is hit or miss when it comes to quality of the food. There have been times I got lots of cheese and toppings, times with the wrong toppings,  and once the whole center of my pizza was sauce only( looked like a circle of cheese was cut out of the center) delivery is usually between 30 to 45 min. Drivers are friendly. So it is your average pizza hut."}
{"text":"Let's start with I order Pizza Hut 5 days a week for work. I do sales and bring pizza with me daily. Pizza Hut is easy to order on the app and super affordable. I've been to at least 100 stores. Today was my first time at this spot. The customer service was awesome. Michelle is fabulous. Never let her go. Your reviews are NOT stellar but she can help them. She acknowledged me as I walked in the door, asked me to wait. Met up with me and took my payment. She asked if I needed plates.  I said yes and she added napkins and peppers without me asking. Huge help and made a huge difference in service. It's that smile & acknowledgement I enjoy in a good experience. Thanks Michelle for making my experience awesome. I'll be back to location as often as I can."}
{"text":"I have been a loyal customer at this Pizza Hut for almost 5 years. I am very picky about my pizza and have several special requests! Andrea and Josh are so helpful and I always get it the way I asked! And they always help me out finding codes for the best price! They go above and beyond!! Thanks to you both!! *But beware, there are 3 others there that are extremely rude!!!* I will only order from Andrea or Josh! You're the Best!"}
{"text":"I came here to try their new crusts.  And it was definitely a poor decision. How does TV marketing pull me in like this??? Ten crusts and drizzles!  Wow!  Affordable? New? Tasty? Nope.

I chose the Asiago crust. Rather than get a great flavor, I felt like it was just a pile of salt on the crust.

However, I must admit this is Pizza Hut, I should not expect a great deal. The rest of the pizza was fine, average per usual. And why three stars?  The staff is always friendly and I appreciate it."}
{"text":"People really nice and the food is great. However, the wings have too much sauce cause my mouth burn. They should ease on it."}
{"text":"Surrounded by dirty tables, the family waits. Waiting for what? A waitress perhaps? A bus boy? Someone to clean the filt surrounding them. 30 minutes have come and passed. 6 tables await. They have been dirty since  the family arrived."}
{"text":"The worst pizza hut franchise. Ordered pizza two hours back, haven't got it delivered. No one picks up the phone at the given number and when I called at pizza hut customer care, first I had to wait for 20 mins n then the lady who picked up the phone said she can't help as it is an online order. I can't imagine such a big company has such a pathetic customer service and such horrible franchise."}
{"text":"I ordered some pizza because I was sick and didn't feel like cooking, I got one of the most disgusting looking pizzas, u went to the store and was told if I wanted to wait 15-20 minutes for them to remake my pizza, I asked for a refund and was told to fill out a form and I would get my money back in 3-6 weeks! I knew Puzza Hut was going under, but damn...I WILL NEVER ORDER PIZZA HUT AGAIN!!!"}
{"text":"Took over an hour and a half to deliver. All we ordered was a pasta, breadsticks and desert. Received a phone call if I still wanted my order then arrived cold without any plasticware. Terrible."}
{"text":"Though I'm rating this a two star, it might be unjust being as we've only ordered from here once --just a disclaimer.

This location is only a takeout shop; there is no dining in.  It's a convenient quick-in, quick-out location.

We've ate at many Pizza Hut's and as most chains always do, they taste almost identical at every location and every visit.  The pizza here; however, didn't.  Though it looked like the typical Pizza Hut pie, the sauce had a remarkable taste of ketchup!  I'm no chef or franchise manager, but I'm thinking perhaps someone may have been running low on sauce and made a quick trip to Harris Teeter on the way to work that day :)

Besides the odd taste, the kids certainly didn't hesitate to devour the pizza --must have been the secret sauce."}
{"text":"Quick, kind service. Food was delicious! I love pizza hut, so this place was not a disappointment. Great for pick up!"}
{"text":"We've been ordering from this pizza hut for awhile now and it's pretty good! The pizza can be pretty greasy (because of the pepperoni) but we just ask to go light on the pepperoni and it helps a ton! Their food is quick and always hot when I pick-up. I would highly suggest this Pizza hut, I don't understand the low rating."}
{"text":"Good old fashion pizza place!!  Just wanted to say that it was such a pleasure eating at this restaurant with friends today.  The service was very good and the guy who help us was extremely attentive.  The food was good for a pizza place, not greasy and the crust didn't wilt when you pick it up.  Just saying...I am giving it five stars because the food was tasty and on time, the management seemed really nice to us and the waiter was over the top friendly.  Unlike a lot of fast food places it seemed like they wanted our return business.   :-)"}
{"text":"I felt highly satisfied with the customer service of this Pizza Hut. We ordered two pizzas on their website shortly before a Penguins game would start. From the time of the order to the time of delivery to our door was only 20 minutes. Super fast, especially with the thousands of fans creating bad traffic outside. The delivery driver came up to our door and made friendly conversation. The pizzas tasted good.

UPDATE: The delivery driver this time was lazy and had an attitude, so I removed one star from my original rating."}
{"text":"I went here for lunch. I bought a personal pan pizza for a few dollars plus a drink. The food took about 10 minutes to be ready for pick up. The cashier/cook was nice."}
{"text":"I hadn't eaten at this Pizza Hut location is over 10 years. I honestly didn't know there were any left in town with seating inside. I have seen them in other states and even with the lunch buffet, but sadly they have disappeared in Vegas. There isn't a salad bar or tabletop Pac-Man game like they used to have however the pizza still comes out piping hot and just tastes better than when you have it delivered or pick it up and take it home to eat it. Inside is spacious and it was really clean. Booths are spacious enough to fit the family and they have smaller tables as well. On the walls they have a few TV's mounted and the decor is cute and funny being themed around the wings they sell and pizzas. 

It was almost 10:30 at night (open until midnight on Saturdays) when we pulled into the parking lot and I figured hubby and I would be the only people there since there wasn't anybody inside but employees. Walking in we were greeted by Vanessa. They have a TV screen that shows how many orders there are and I noticed a couple other customers ahead of us. Vanessa took our order and let us know how long it would be. After picking a table and getting our drinks, it really started getting busy inside. There were customers picking up orders, placing dine-in orders and as well to-go orders. We beat the late night rush! 

Our pizza was ready in the time promised and plates, silverware, crushed peppers and cheese were brought to the table. We ordered the \"Big Flavor Dipper Pizza\" priced at $12.99 and our choice of 2 different sauce sets. One of eh sets just being 4 cups of marinara, we decided to chose the \"explore\" option which gets you 2 cups of marinara, 1 cup ranch, 1 cup BBQ and 1 cup honey sriracha. The pizza is almost 2 feet long and cut into 24 strips. Each strip had 3 pieces of pepperoni. Like I mentioned before, the pizza just tastes different when it's brought to your table piping hot and right from the oven and I like that. This pizza reminded me more of an appetizer since it's smaller than your average slice of pizza and being easily hand held with dip. It was far from any appetizer though for just 2 people and we had plenty to take home. The pizza box is also about 2 feet long, so I wonder how the delivery drivers have been doing with that?! Speaking of that, they do offer delivery here."}
{"text":"So I ordered a pizza and some bread sticks from here....seems reasonable enough right? 

Order came pretty fast which was fantastic.... however when I sat down to enjoy my meal.. I realized they had given me the wrong pizza! 

I know it's only human error but come on how hard is delivering the right pizza to the right house! like that's your ONLY JOB!!!

I wouldn't have cared so much but I was really HANGRY!!! The pizza was even bigger than what I had ordered.. too bad I don't eat meat! I opened the box and there was bits of cow on my pizza... not cool because I almost took a bite and I'm a vegetarian! 

Called and he said he would call me back.... ten minutes later I called him back and asked if the pizza I ordered was coming... haha what a joke.

....Room mate got a free pizza tho ...lucky him."}
{"text":"Cold pizza, an hour for delivery and the staff is either brain dead or stoned...could be a combination of both."}
{"text":"New Pizza Hut location in my area! 

Went in for a carryout order tonight. The employees were very friendly and prompt. 

Pizza was kinda off, but I was super hungry so I ate it anyway haha. I'll be back I'm sure."}
{"text":"Called the corporate number to order our pizza and ordered at 7:20pm. The rep said it'll arrive in 45 mins. It is currently 9:15pm and no pizza. We've had to call three different numbers to find out where our pizzas are and we were given a crazy amount of run around; first the order didn't come into the store, then the store didn't put paper in the printer(?). 

Starving and so pissed I didn't just order dominos instead. 

GET IT TOGETHER PIZZA HUT!"}
{"text":"All you can eat pizza is probably the worst thing they could have possibly done. Just another way to fatten up the Toronto population. Have you ever seen the people that come in here to eat the all you can eat pizza? Jeez. You'd think that if you need to walk sideways through a door, you probably shouldn't be eating pizza. 

Now that being said, I do like the all you can eat pizza and I do indulge in it every now and then. (probably once or twice a year because they only do this during the week days). No, I do not need to walk sideways through the door. I actually am 150 lb of pure rock hard muscle.

Regardless, I still like to eat here for lunch just for the all you can eat pizza. But onto the reviews, the pizza is decent. I never really fell in love with the pizza at Pizza Hut. The dough that they use just doesn't appeal to me and it kind of seems like they leave the pizza in the oven a little longer to burn the dough a little more. There is also a ton of grease on the pizza too which is not very healthy. The only saving grace is that they do serve salads. However, if you are craving pizza and lots of it, Pizza Hut isn't bad. Do not try the pasta's. They are terrible. Whoever decided to start selling cheap disgusting pasta's at a Pizza restaurant should be shot."}
{"text":"I usually get pizza here but today it was dry, overcooked and barely warm. Highly disappointed, I'll probably switch locations."}
{"text":"A lot of whiners on here.  One bad experience and they think its the end of the world.  I have been coming to this Pizza Hut for over 5 years.  Only had a couple of issues and all were minor.  Love Pizza Hut pizza and this one has been the most consistent in quality compared to many other ones I've tried around the valley.  Even though the staff changes frequently the service has almost always been quick and friendly."}
{"text":"After ordering online, the estimated time for delivery was 75min. That didn't bother me too much (maybe they were busy). So I called 10min after the order just to check the status. TWELVE MINUTES ON HOLD and then I got hung up on!!! 

80min later my 2L soda ended up being a 16oz, there was no cheese on my COLD, underdone pizza, and the wings seemed underdone as they were soggy and NOT spicy (as described). 

This is our closest Pizza Hut location and I wish it wasn't. We received poor tasting overpriced food."}
{"text":"I called this place to place a delivery order. They charged my debit card like all places do. 

The next day my same card had 2 unauthorized purchases from Barnes and Noble online. This was the only place or person who had my card numbers. 

Seems fishy someone was making purchases the next day!

I called and spoke to as manager and they said there was no way they could determine who took the order. That's a lie, because the top of my receipt said the name of whom checked me out. 

SKETCH!!!"}
{"text":"We stopped ordering from pizza hut. Even after talking with the manager we received horrible pizza. It was obvious that they were taking a premade pepperoni and then putting our toppings on and reheating.  We will never order from them again. We found Little 
 Sicily a couple weeks ago and it is wonderful.  It's on bell and grand and it is worth having to pick it up yourself."}
{"text":"I'm sitting inside of Pizza Hut st the 7000 block of west Ann Rd. How do I say this? This is the 3rd time calling this Pizza Hut. Each time I hung up because the message was everyone is busy please wait. This time I decided to come into the store. What do you think I found? There's only one (1) person working this carry out. This is totally unexceptable. I've had Pizza Hut before so I'm going to say that Pizza is/ was ok. To operate with only 1 person making the Pizza and working the register is totally out of line. I really wanted Pizza Hut but I will never ever bring my business to this store again. Customer service at this store is in the sewer for this store. Placed my order at 4:17 PM. It's 4:45 PM an the phone hasn't stop ringing. The guy on duty can't answer because he's trying to fill the 6 pending orders."}
{"text":"Unfortunately this location is a hot mess. 2hrs plus wait for your delivery order and an incredibly impossible manager who will never contact you to follow up on any complaints (It's been a year. Lol)... but judging from the other reviews, it's clear that his/her call back list is their entire delivery area, so he/she might be very busy. Disappointing from a chain that use to be one of the best.
Food quality is hit or miss, on slower nights it's good but incredibly oily & salty... on a busy weekend the food quality is subpar at best."}
{"text":"Fast service. Fast pizza. Thin crust made any way you want for cheap. Enjoyed a salad too. Plenty of food
 Great for family and kids. Wine and bottled beer. Will have to go back!!"}
{"text":"I think it's better to order and wait in the store than to order online or call it in. Not that it was faster at the store, but the wait time is less - about an hour less. So, we called the store to check on our order and was informed that it would be arriving at 8:15 PM or so. Or so. That's scary.  Indeed. It took over an hour and a half for the two pizzas to arrive. Would have been done with dinner and already at home had we gone out to eat at a restaurant. It might have been more expensive but less inconvenient. Talk about paying for convenience! Anyway, girl that delivered our pizza said they were busy when we asked what was going on. I mean, really?! Our order wasn't complicated. I don't understand how others can deliver a similar order in half the time. No, not even half the time! It's less than half! Good news, our order was correct and the pizza was still hot enough to be enjoyed. That's what the two stars are for."}
{"text":"I have given this location a few tries in hopes that there would be an all around good experience. Tonight will be my last time coming to this location. Placing my order was fine. I deliberately asked if they had red peppers, because the last time I ordered they didnt have any. I was told yes they have red peppers. I ordered 2  large pan pizza. I drove to Pizza Hut to pick my order. As I am pulling into a parking, there is a girl wearing a Pizza Hut uniform dancing while a guy was holding up his cell phone making a video or taking pictures of her dancing. I pick up my pizza and ask for red peppers. The guy said they didn't have any red peppers. I was disappointed but paid for the pizza. I get home and open the boxes, the pizzas were small. I called to Pizza Hut spoke to the manager, Jacob and he was not even helpful. He lacked professionalism. His customer service was terrible. His attitude was a reflection of his customer service, very poor. Jacob over talking me, he was rude. I asked for his name, I said I would like to call corporate tomorrow, the manager Jacob hung up on me!. I took the pizzas back and requested a refund. I took my business somewhere else for dinner. Never again will anyone of my family members order Pizza from there. I rather spend my money at a place that values my business."}
{"text":"I will admit, the pizza was just okay, but the delivery guy was so nice that I had to write a comment.  His name tag said \"Thor\" but I think his name was Jesse. He was so nice and prompt. Everyone in customer service should take after this young man.  I give him 5 stars!"}
{"text":"I love eating pizza Hut over dominos any day,But not anymore. I'm going back to dominos well or atleast till I get to a better Pizza hut. This one takes forever no matter if it's a slow day or pack day. They can never get the order right either. Sorry three tries is good enough. Wouldn't recommend this pizza hut to anyone unless if they like to wait......"}
{"text":"My wife and I have been talking about Pizza Hut for some time now. We typically go to Dominos or Little Caesars because they are peanut free and we have a child with a peanut allergy. Long story short we ordered online for ourselves and were surprised they are doing flavored crusts since we haven't had Pizza Hut in some time. We ordered two mediums thinking we would have leftovers and a little something different on both pizzas. I went to pick up and the girl working was really friendly. When we get home we realize the hype of the flavored crusts was just that...HYPE, because it was just the regular pan pizza. Still not a deal breaker. Everything looks and smells great. After a few bites I am thinking the middle part of the pizza seems a little flimsy. Upon closer look completely doughy. I kinda feel like calling the store and ask how long and what temperature should I put the pizza back in to cook it. We now have another reason to go to Dominos instead. Nothing is worse than when you spend you money on a inferior product and a bad experience follows. If you read this Pizza Hut please flag my account because I won't be back and if I do...please tell me to go across the road instead. *side note-this should be a 1star review no clue why its rating it 2 stars*"}
{"text":"Wow. Ive been ordering pizza from this location for a long time. I expected my order to take a while, but it came within 30 minutes of my online order! And it was hot! So unexpected! I don't know what happend, but thank you! Please please keep it up! I am not a Domino's fan nor A Papa John's fan. I will always be A Pizza hut fan.. thank you for making my night!"}
{"text":"I don't give many reviews for Chain Restaurants, I figure everyone pretty much knows what to expect. However, with how bad my local Dominos is, I felt it would be helpful to give a counter review for my local Pizza Hut, as I believe it is a much better option. I only order from here once every few months, but in my experience it is always a quality choice. The food is always good, the service is friendly, they've never messed up my order and even though I don't live far from this location, delivery is always prompt. All in all, I don't think you can ask for much more from a chain pizza place."}
{"text":"Avoid this place at all cost.  Probably the worst customer service I've experienced in my entire life."}
{"text":"LOL, my wife ordered pizza from this place before I got home, they screwed THAT order up too.
She and I get very different pizzas and mine always has the extra sauce, of course they put the extra sauce on her pizza, so she couldn't eat it because the extra sauce makes the pizza too spicy for her, and mine of course is too dry for me. Wasted money on more WRONG pizzas...... 
I've said it a million times, the wife will never listen to me no matter how much money it costs me....
I ate Ramen Noodles and Tuna instead.
WORST PIZZA HUT EVER, wrong pizza 4 out of 5 times. Totino's is better, at least you know for sure what you are getting and paying for."}
{"text":"It was ok. We tried a few of the new specialty pizzas. Ordered pan crust, only on delivery did they say they were out and had substituted hand tossed. Which was soggy in the middle. They tried but it bugs me immensely. 

For $60 in pizza, it's inexcusable.
They did hook us up with a coupon for wings though. It takes the sting away a bit."}
{"text":"Pathetic.... The staff is insanely rude , I called the store to complain about an order and the girl just said \"k thanks\" and hung up !! What kind of service is that !? Nothing but young kids that work there , plus there pizza made my family sick ! Dirty store , save your money and go somewhere else that cares for there costumers"}
{"text":"I'm very disappointed with my last 2 orders- toppings fell off the pizza.  Overall the pizza was flavourless, ended up throwing the leftovers out, instead of packing them for lunches. Never ordering from this branch again.  Quality has dropped immensely."}
{"text":"Horrible service. I ordered breadsticks, just breadsticks. It took 45 MINUTES! And the cook was eating while she cooked. Not secret snacking, she was chomping away at the food she was making!!  
I was not asked size options, is there only one size? My sticks cost $4.50, which I thought was steep, and after, yes after I had already paid, and been given my change,.. she said \"it's going to be 15-20 minutes, is that ok?\" Well considering you've already taken my money do I have a choice? SO I said yes and waited, tried my damnedest to be patient, when 40 minutes rolled around there was 5 of us standing at the counter saying \"come on, this is ridiculous\". Because it was!! 

Pizza Hut was a childhood favorite. I hadn't been to a Pizza Hut in YEARS, and I will NOT be going back :("}
{"text":"The food is fine, but every time I have ordered out they have gotten the order wrong or forgot something in the delivery. Mind you, I have only ordered from this restaurant 3 times. When they would try to deliver the forgotten items it takes a few hours even though the restaurant is less than half a mile away from me."}
{"text":"I love you guys. Never a bad experience. Here's my question: Years ago you guys had a spicy and a pretzel crust option. The spicy one went away, then later the pretzel crust went away. Now the second option for red sauce has gone away?? And the peruvian peppers? Every time I come back, a different option has gone away! Why? Please pass this on to higher. The options were great. Please bring them back."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I order from here regularly and every time the food is awesome and the service is great! We will definitely continue picking up from this location as we love the food and the staff. Highly recommend 10/10"}
{"text":"The pizza was good however the service was less than to be desired. I originally ordered over the phone the delivery time was 50 mins. I called right back and said ill pick it up. When I arrived the person that took my order Acoya did not change it to carry out. I ask did he correct my pricing to the $10 carryout price. Instead of fixing the price being lazy he offered me a soda that I did not want or ask for. Its called customer service ..... definition showing you value your customers."}
{"text":"Normally I would give Pizza Hut 4-5 stars but today I am just not happy. My food was delivered on time but I didn't appreciate the fact that I had to warm it up just to eat it. I don't expect it to be hot like it just came out of the oven but I would appreciate it if it wasn't cold, especially when the store is less than 2 miles from my house! Hopefully when I order from here again this review will have been read and my food will not be cold. Maybe then you will get a 5 star rating..."}
{"text":"I called to get a pizza delivered to palazzo hotel. The first thing the guy asks was if I had ordered?? Umm no I'm trying to order. Then he tells me it will take \"2!! Hours to get delivered. Wow!! And I said that's fine. Then he puts me on hold. Ok I waited and then it lasted more than 20 min.. Are you kidding me!! then they answer and click. This is ridiculous."}
{"text":"No more salad bar, what a joke. It would be nice to see new owners for this place that cared for customer service. Hate to say it but must, typical Buckeye."}
{"text":"Maybe the other reviewer was at this location on an off night because we had a completely different experience.  We had a limited amount of time and weren't sure if we'd be able to get out pizza and still have enough time to have an enjoyable meal but we did.  The service was efficient and friendly and also informed us of the various deals they had going on (including $10 pizzas).  
The pizza came out in about 15 minutes and was prepared exactly as we had ordered and tasted wonderful.  It had the perfect amount of pepperoni and the crust was done just right.  During our time eating, the server checked back on us several times to see if we needed anything else and refilled our water and pop.

Bottom line - this is Pizza Hut, a chain pizza \"restaurant\"  Don't go expecting gourmet food or five star service and you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I ordered a cheese pizza and cheesy bread at 5:45 online. The pizza was supposed to arrive by 6:30 but by 6:35 I didn't get any text and when I would check online to see it said it was still being made. I called and the girl asked for my name then she went \"oh no\" under her breathe, finally she said it was out on delivery and hung up fairly fast. Around 6:49 I got a text saying it was out for delivery. The pizza finally around at 7:01. The pizza was extremely oily and when you would hold it up it was soggy from the oil. Normally I would have called and said something but I had three hungry little boys. I probably won't be ordering from this location again."}
{"text":"I didn't give this rating based on taste because I frankly hate Pizza Hut pizza. I think it's gross. The sandwiches and wings are great though. My fiance loves it all though. I like it because it is right next to our house and the staff are always friendly. I pick it up on my way home and if I get there early they try to get it for me as soon as they can."}
{"text":"Until recently I would have given this place one star because of absolutely horrible service.  Their delivery was bad beyond words, often taking hours, if at all.  Recently, they have changed managers and are improving. Their pizzas are pretty standard Pizza Hut fare, but prepared according to the menu, with good amount of toppings.  Quality is actually quite good.  They are reliable for pick up and recently reliable for delivery as well.  Worth a try."}
{"text":"Not to sound like a complete nit picker, but the service was perfectly fine. Charging for extra sauce is a little annoying and the main issue was the yelling in the back of the store. Again, I'm not one to make mean reviews or what not, but I wish they wouldn't charge extra for small things"}
{"text":"I arrived a few minutes after the pick up time given and they told me it might be 30 minutes because they ran out of pan and hand tossed ( ok would have been good to know before I left my house with a quick call). The female at the counter went back to see if \" my order had been started\" ... Ok, good to know now that I here. She came back to say it should only be 10 min @ 7:45 ( pick up time 7:42). My name on the screen has changed from 7:42 to 7:52 - still waiting. They only have one person for the counter and phone... Lobby full of people, screen full of \"ready\" and we are all waiting. I hope to get my food before my kids bedtime"}
{"text":"When I went, customer service was top notch, and the pizza order was good quality. I am so thankful for the pleasant experience!"}
{"text":"Had the pizza delivered and it has been quite some time since I had Pizza Hut. I ordered sausage but had to look for it on the pizza. The cheese didn't even cover the entire pizza. So this is how they make pizzas now? Quite disappointing."}
{"text":"I have ordered at 9 PM and they delivered at 11:10 PM after 130 min. When i asked them to cancel my order they kept on giving reasons. Irresponsibility, Negligence, No punctuality never ever order from this place. Charged for garlic sauce but didn't deliver it although added a meat piece on a Veg Pizza."}
{"text":"We ordered the triple treat box. The price was good. Like $20-something for the 2 medium pizzas, breadsticks and giant chocolate chip cookie. My disappointment came when I went for the dessert cookie and found a brownie, which I do not like and did not order. I checked the receipt and it was ordered correctly. And My kids wanted the fun box that it is suppose to come in. Instead we got 3 pizza boxes. Not a big deal but just added to an already disappointing experience."}
{"text":"This is the last time I go to this pizza hot, because the service is bad when you call and in person they say that it's going to be a 45 to 50 minute wait and they don't pay attention if they even took your order when you call , you get there and turns out that they didn't even take your order. No wonder why this has a bad review ...Don't go to this Pizza Hut."}
{"text":"do not order from here!! i ordered my pizza 2 hours ago for 2 pizza's! only for the tracking system to say it was being made for an hour and a half! we called and got put on hold for almost 10minutes!! we personally went down there only for them to tell us our delivery driver canceled our order! we were in the living room next to our open bay window waiting for 2 hours and nothing. they told us he tried to call, no missed call. they said he probably tried to ring the door bell no one did. awful service do not order from here if you want to be left waiting and have to wait even longer for our money back!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Stoughton PH is as fine an example as any other. Could you get \"local\" elsewhere, yes. Marsala's, and Famous Yeti, or go to Oregon for Maria's. That said, sometimes Pizza Hut is the thing to get, and the specials will often drive the decision. Staff has been friendly every time, the food is fresh, and we've never had an order made wrong. Well done Pizza Hut."}
{"text":"Worst $5 pizza ever! We ordered 2 pizzas ... A sausage and pineapple , both were dry , burnt and just plain sad!! The sausage pieces looked like dry kibble , that's the first thing that came to mind when I opened the box... The pineapple pizza wasn't any better ... Granted they were only $5 but nonetheless we would've been better off with a store bought frozen pizza !! Nice customer service but not enough to go back , even if it was $5 per pizza !!"}
{"text":"Ordering online was very quick and simple. The employees working are there simply for s paycheck and nothing more. It appeared they had a cooler filled with pre-made pizzas. The pizza was ready at the time promised online. If you are looking for low quality ingredients at a low price then Pizza Hut is the answer. If I had to guess, the dough was frozen and has 20+ingredients. The pork is from commodity pigs and the tomatoes are not organic. Not the worst tasting pizza but we won't be back."}
{"text":"Smells

Good service, good food but the place smells like an old, musty motel room. I'm local and have been there several times and it always smells. There's almost a \"needs cleaning\" public bathroom tinge to it as well. 

You'll know; stop where the little foyer ends about 15' inside the front door and inhale through your nose.

It's an old place so it's time for renovation or replacement."}
{"text":"Last couple of times we ordered from this locatin as it was close to the house and figured it would be faster.  Wrong!! took over an hour for 1 lg pizza and wings.

food was cold and pizza sucked with little sauce or cheese.  Toppings were rather light too.  Guess they are trying to cut food costs.

Location - Do you really want to buy pizza from a store thats right next to a bikini wax shop?

Bottom Line (pardon the pun) - Look for other options like Marco's Pizza."}
{"text":"Ordered 2 pies for Delivery with multiple different toppings and crusts. They obviously have no concept of what 'Light Sauce' is. The 1 pizza has so much sauce, it drowned the toppings. Had to throw it away. There was so much sauce, the pie was bright red, couldnt even tell there was cheese. 
The Thin & Crispy was not even close to crispy!

Terrible waste of time and money!"}
{"text":"Today was the fourth time my order was messed up.
A few days ago I was eating in and we ordered a pizza and a salad, we never got our salad and when we went to ask for it me and a few friends saw who we believe is the manager move from putting  pepperoni on a pizza straight to sticking his bare ungloved hand into the vegetable bin. After that we ordered pizza and they completely messed up our order by not bringing the correct pizza. Then we went back thinking \"ohhh everyone makes mistakes.\" Long story short our pizza was under-cooked and doughy. Today, while I was in the restroom my little sister payed for our pizza. The total was $12 and she gave her a 20. My sister asked for change and she gave her 2 dollars back. Their driver effectively ripped off a little girl and smashed our pizza on the way."}
{"text":"First of all, I never eat at Pizza Hut but the only reason I did was because I had a gift card. How hard is it to get an order correct when you order only 2 pizzas? Their pizza is decent, but the service and the people they get working there better learn to pay attention or they have a long life ahead of them working in the fast food industry. When do the machines take over?"}
{"text":"Does anybody know corporates number ??? I ordered one large pizza.. it was already an hour that I hadn't received it so I called to ask about how much longer it would be.. \"cristina\" the manager on duty answered the phone and Sai it was on the way barely. I told her I hope it wasn't cold because I was not going to pay for a cold pizza after waiting an hour.. she said that iw wouldn't recieve the pizza then so i asked \"so is my pizza cold?\" & she so rudely said \"ok i will call the driver and cancel your order\" & then she clicked ! Worst experience ever I can't believe someone could be so rude!"}
{"text":"Order online, call to see if I can change the ready time and I was told I cannot due to it being an online order I had to call corporate. Hmmmm don't they make the pizza tho?! Kid was rude, we'll see how the pizza is. 2nd time we've had issues with this location. We won't be using them again."}
{"text":"I think first of all that pizza hut is the best pizza you can buy for the price you pay. I was very happy when they re-opened the location on 36 st and Thomas as is my closest one. First time I went inside it looked like a sports bar as they had at least 5 big screen tv's playing different games (I love sport bars) also the food was amazing as always. We usually get the meat lovers pizza with pan crust. I paid $15 for 2 medium pizzas and I think that is a great deal considering all the toppings you get. Everything was cooked perfectly. I went back yesterday and this time I used the very convenient drive thru so if you don't feel like getting out the car or have many kids with you or just in a hurry then you can definitely use that."}
{"text":"This was my first visit here because I just moved to the area. I live two minutes away and they said they can't deliver to my house which I thought was very odd. So I ordered for pick up. I ordered at 12pm and scheduled the pick up for 1pm. I got there on time and paid with tip. The guy told me it's almost done. Twenty minutes later I still didn't get my food. A person came in and ordered right after I paid and still got her food before me as a walk in!! I wanted to walk out but I had already paid, regretting even giving a tip. I finally got my food and drove home to discover that my cheese bread was cinnamon bread with cheese on top. It was disgusting and a waste of money! There was no point of me going out of the way to order ahead if I could have gotten my food faster as a walk in. Advice to those who work here... If people order an hour ahead they should have their food ready at the time they expect it. Never going to go here again!"}
{"text":"Absolutely terrible service.they botched the pizza,did not brief us with the specials, so my wife and i paid thirty dollars instead of 15.00$ ..not recomended"}
{"text":"Got two personal pan pizzas today ... had better ... not very tasty and we don't plan to return here when we are in the area which is pretty often ... not sure what is happening at Pizza Hut but we have not been impressed lately"}
{"text":"It's no doubt your ratings are so low.  I was picking my husband up from work (in a gated residential community) Thursday night 6/13 when a silver jeep commando (with the Pizza Hut hat on its roof displaying the telephone number of (702) 253-9011) sped by me.  As we were driving out of the gates, the same silver jeep commando was riding our butt and then started beeping his horn at us WHILE WE WERE WAITING FOR THE GATE TO OPEN!  I then called the 253-9011 number, was given the run around by the telephone answerer, I asked for a supervisor who advised their store does not deliver to 7885 W. Flamingo, he offered the telephone number of the store that would deliver to that address.  I dialed the number and got a recording that said they were closed.  I then called several other pizza hut stores asking if they delivered to 7885 W Flamingo, they all pointed me to the store I originally called.  I hope this review gets to a person with integrity & authority so action might be taken to avoid unsafe, impatient drivers possibly taking a life."}
{"text":"Absolute worst. 2 hour delivery time, called to check and see where order was and was told it was on the way. 30 minutes later no pizza, called back and was on hold for 10 minutes. I ALWAYS order from dominos but my location was closed for renovations so I had no choice but to order from Pizza Hut. Never again"}
{"text":"Horrible. My pizza and wings were under cooked, the service from the employees was horrendous. And when I asked if i could get the pizza cooked a bit more, they were extremely rude telling me I was holding up the line. 10/10 would never go back again."}
{"text":"Met Rand out here for the buffet lunch.  The place was 3/4 full when we got there about 11:30.  Started with a basic salad of greens with some add ins and choice of about 6 dressings.  Then a couple of pizza trips with some pasta and bread sticks.  The pizza was ok, but not great.  The pasta was kept in small tins in a warmer and the pizza was under heat lamps.  Nothing stayed out for long so they have a pretty good handle on how much to have out at any one time.  Plates were another story, they ran completely out for a short time.  I had noticed the server running around asking if people were done with their plates as we got there so I would guess they don't have enough.  It has started thinning out by the time we left an hour later so they apparently have an early crowd for lunch in the area."}
{"text":"I am giving this location 1 star for usually the pizza is good and another because I had a terrible pizza. I ordered pizza and the pizza was not fully cooked. I tasted the dough, which was so gross. When I called customer service to get another pizza, she forward me to the store. From there he asked me what happened to my pizza I explained that the pizza was not cooked. He wasn't very polite on the phone and said you have to return the pizza to us and we will send you a new pizza. I said okay when I received the new pizza it still was undercooked. I couldn't eat the pizza and so the next day we try to put the pizza in the oven to cook it again and the pizza was so bad. I'm not impressed I'm hoping that they will improve their service. I don't think the people that were cooking this time did a good job usually the pizza is great. I won't be having pizza hut for a while."}
{"text":"Listen to other poor reviews. This is the worst Pizza Hut I've ever gone to. The lobby closes at 8:30 and they make you pick up through a drive thru which gets backed up quickly.  The service is extremely rude.  The store is very sketchy.  I contacted Pizza Hut corporate 3 times regarding an unsatisfactory experience but not once got a reply from the store.  This store does not care about customer satisfaction or making things right... They just want your money.  Do yourself a favor and stay far, far away from this specific Pizza Hut location.  Unless they begin to turn things around, I expect eventually they will be forced to shut down this store location."}
{"text":"Preordered online 3 hours in advance for a scheduled pickup time.  Upon arriving, was told the pizza was not ready.  Waited an additional 10 minutes until they handed me my pizza.  It only got worse from here.  The two pizzas I ordered were terrible.  The crust was too thin and hard, barely any sauce or cheese and the stuffed crust were definitely not stuffed.  More like stuffed with air and a tiny bit of cheese.  Avoid this place.  Will never return."}
{"text":"This is the location that delivers to my home. I have ordered several times and gotten great service. I only had a problem once and it was made right asap. If you haven't ordered from PH lately, you need to check them out. They have some amazing and creative food. This isn't your grandfather's pizza."}
{"text":"Delivery forgot an item. When I called to have it redelivered, the pizza hut employee made it like I was inconveniencing them to get my item redelivered. Props to the driver who had a great attitude! This isn't the first time they haven't forgot to deliver an item."}
{"text":"Can't believe this place has not been reviewed.   But then, does anyone even eat here anymore?
You will be safe if you just order a salad.  But do not order a pizza of any kind, do not get the pizza buffet, do not order any cheese sticks or garlic bread.
We stopped by here a while back knowing they had gone downhill but figured that maybe a different place might do better than others.  Nope.
The pizzas are no longer the wonderful treat they used to be.   Pizza Hut was once one of our favorite pizza places.
The crust and ingredients are cheap copies of what once was.   The bread is puffy nothingness.   What a shame.
One year later....
We no longer eat at Pizza Hut but they were brought in as a lunch item where I work 12/187/2012.  There was a thin layer of cheese over some sort of \"wonderbread-like\" crust that puffed up.  A scattering of flavorless meat and pepperoni. What a bunch of crap.  Nothing like the good ol' days when Pizza Hut was the place to go.   All it would take is for a new pizza establishment to come in and drive these shells of \"what once was great\" out of business."}
{"text":"The pizza was hot and taste very good,  and I ordered medium spiced wings that were very good the only problem I have is that when I order online and they tell me it'll be ready in 15 minutes it's usually 25 minutes.  So I will make sure to wait 20 or 25 minutes before I go and pick up my order online and that will solve the problem.  Four stars for the food and less for the ordering system at least the staff is friendly."}
{"text":"I don't normally order pizza from pizza hut but I figured why not mix it up a little bit? I am sorry that I did. I ordered online for carry out. Upon arriving, I was told to hold On twice after saying I was there for pick up. The cashier was conversing with someone off to the side. Someone else asked me if I had been helped and had to make the girl help me. Annoying. To add insult to injury, the bacon that I ordered was NOT on my pizza once I got home."}
{"text":"I kindly asked if they could de-bone my pizza. (Boneless) but they said no. I choked on a bone and ended up in the ER. The pizza was tasty, don't get me wrong. But I choked on a bone. Personally I don't think it was worth it."}
{"text":"Placed an order online for pick up, received an email confirmation and noticed my order was incorrect. I tried calling the store immediately to confirm, but was left on hold for 10 minutes on two phones before being hung up on. I called back again and was placed on hold once again before someone picked up. When I spoke to them I was informed that my order was already done. I told them about the hold situation yet they weren't able to correct my order because they were \"out of pan dough\".  I chose to cancel my order and have the sale voided. When I asked if there was going to be any email confirmation of the voided sale the employee basically told me to take his word. I decided to drive to the location and have a physical copy of the voided sale printed for me. All in all, complete lack of customer service. I will not be placing any future orders at this location!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend ordered a pizza for delivery 50 minutes ago. Pizza never arrived. He called to confirm and find out what was going on. They told him that the delivery drivers car was stolen. They asked multiple times if he wanted to cancel. He asked why no one called to let him know that the driver would not be delivering and the employee said \"his phone was in his car\" ok... I guess no one in the store knows how to pick up a phone?! Anyway, I ended up driving here to pick up instead of waiting for another delivery driver. Ive been here 20 min and the phone has been ringing non stop. I would avoid this place!!!! Nothing but problems almost every time we order."}
{"text":"I don't know why they chose to convert this into a lunch buffet but okay, I remember when the majority of Pizza Hut's used to be buffets. When you come in you have to wait to be seated even though the place looks like your standard fast food joint. Maybe it's like my partners mother said, they are just trying to exert some class into the place. or something..

Service was friendly and the pizza is pretty standard for a Pizza Hut which is pretty good since we all know what to expect from a Pizza Hut, we just want them to deliver that standard."}
{"text":"I like being called boss lady a lot, and my fiancé likes to be called boss. We heard a lot of this while dining here after an exhausting day of moving decades worth of accumulated belongings. The waiter took awhile to get us any menus but the place was busy in all fairness. The pizza and fries were actually pretty good compared to the locations in Chandler, does Chandler really suck that bad?

Service was friendly, as I mentioned we heard a lot of, \"what can I get for you boss?\" etc. This location was also a lot nicer than what I am used to for Pizza Hut. Although I hear a lot of aggravation over wait times. A lady coming out as we were going in was grumbling to herself about how she had to wait 40 min to pick up her order. I don't know about you, but when I see people grumbling to themselves I have to think they are supremely pissed off about something. Maybe not the best location to eat if you are shell shocked starved or in a hurry?"}
{"text":"I placed an order for a personal pizza and an order of wings. I ended up with two orders of wings, no pizza. Called the store, spoke to the manager who isn't willing to do anything about it because \"it says you ordered two orders of wings\". That will be the last time I order from Pizza Hut!"}
{"text":"Worst experiance here. Called to order but staff was clearly preoccupied/ did not hear the order after repeating ourselves multiple times. My 72 year old aunt then called to complain. When asked why the staff was unable to take our order correctly the manager became rude insisting my aunt was 'insulting their staff' and that he 'wouldn't tolerate it' .... For asking a question? Terrible. My aunt was so upset. Never even considering eating here again. Spreading the word as well."}
{"text":"Super Bowl + snow storm I thought I would have to wait forever for delivery. The website said 70 minutes. I received my order in 30. I love the new choices for crusts! I got the hand tossed crushed red pepper crust and pepperoni and jalapeños for toppings. Yumm!"}
{"text":"No wonder you have bad ratings.. Brought my daughter here to get her free pizza for having a good reading level at school and as we were waiting for this pizza all I hear are the two employees in the back complaining about anything and everything of the restaurant and all the employees that work here. Not to mention they are comparing salaries and pay what they think they should be paid and what other people are being paid that work here. Not exactly the conversation I want to listen to while I'm waiting for my pizza."}
{"text":"HORRIBLE service.
HORRIBLE food.
HORRIBLE experience.
and I should have know there was a problem when I got a side of Marinara----he could have told me there was NO SAUCE on my pizza."}
{"text":"Yummy!! It was my first time ordering the veggie pizza, it actually turned out to be very delicious.  They got it to me quick still hot.  Thanks!"}
{"text":"Since the Pizza Hut brand brought in their new pizza's and crust options it's been better and not to mention the delivery service. I am a fan of their pretzel crust because it has that fantastic taste. Still I was not totally satisfied because I am from Chicago, but not a fan of deep dish like everyone thinks I like New York style."}
{"text":"This is my maybe 7th time picking up and receiving a delivery, with delivery they almost never bring my sauces I pay for. Then when ordering and picking up which I thought would be easier... it's not, I come there to this location I receive an email that my food is ready and it says it's ready on their screen but surprise it's not ready usually takes 35-45 mins even though I'm quoted 10-20 mins via website and app and even told it's ready. I'd give zero stars. They usually have a little girl running the front who is rude and always claims she doesn't know and it'll be just a sec. it's really bad service here folks. I don't recommend it."}
{"text":"I go to this Pizza Hut for carry out frequently. They're always prompt, accurate, and friendly!"}
{"text":"Just avoid going here. They are guaranteed to mess up your order, as well as lack any form of professionalism, but when you staff a location with nothing but teenagers, I guess that's to be expected these days. If you're really craving Pizza Hut, you'd be better off just finding a different location."}
{"text":"Awful service, crappy overcooked pizza.  Rude, immature workers with totally uncaring management.  I only go here when Pizza Hit has cheap deal.  That is all the pizza is worth.  The only good thing is the place is clean."}
{"text":"Terrible service better off ordering home. took 20 min for water and over a hour for the food."}
{"text":"So I ordered 2 large pizzas and some bread sticks the other day, since the sale was still going on. I ordered a bacon/pineapple and a pepperoni/pineapple pizza for myself and my boyfriend. While the bacon/pineapple was for myself (with leftovers of course), my boyfriend exclusively ate the pepperoni/pineapple.

A few hours passed and my boyfriend starts complaining about a stomach ache that felt like he was being stabbed. And just an hour later, he was vomitting up a storm. It turned out to be food poisoning when he went to the doctor the next morning.

Never ordering from this Pizza Hut again. You mess with my boyfriend's stomach, you get no business from moi."}
{"text":"Alex the pizza  delivery person was absolutely fantastic in his delivery. He was friendly, courteous, and helpful. I called to inform his manager, Rainbow, of his accomplishments, but she was less than enthusiastic. I would absolutely compliment Alex, but not so much Rainbow. Rainbow sucks."}
{"text":"That 4-star comes with a grain of salt: it's Pizza Hut, so the food is standard across the board.

I give this one a 4 star because I have ordered from them thrice without a mistake! (that's good for any chain pizza joint in my experience). 

I live within driving distance, so I pick up the pizzas instead of delivery. I have had my pizza within 20 minutes of ordered every time.

Also, we once ordered a half and half pizza and it came out correctly, a big risk in my opinion. 

As I mentioned, the food is exactly the same in flavor as any other Pizza Hut, which is fine, but the service here really sets them apart from the others."}
{"text":"Customer service was awesome for me. Pizza was about an 8. I gave an extra point because the veggies were really fresh. If I had to go off of the lady on the phone taking my order alone...10s across the board!"}
{"text":"I have lived in Vegas for 2 years and NEVER had as great of customer service like I did tonight from this store. Freddy had greeted me when i entered the store and I let him know my dissatisfaction with the new salted pretzel crust my husband ordered. He promptly , showed his concern and quickly made me a new one AND threw in a drink for the troubles...  I think every restaurant needs someone like Freddy :D 

\"You should never be forced to eat something your not satisfied  with\" - Freddy 

Great employee Pizza Hut !!"}
{"text":"I called in for delivery and waited an hour for them to deliver my pizza which yes they might have been busy I understand but when they drop it off I didn't take a look at the pizza because I was working and put it in the back in the break room as soon as I went to go get a slice the entire pizza was burned and it looked old. I waited an hour at least you guys should have made sure my pizza was not burn and at least somewhat fresh. It's so mess up. They wouldn't even give my money back."}
{"text":"I know Pizza Hur (REALLY?!?!).....

BUT, This is one of the only last standing Pizza Huts around in CLE where you can walk in and sit and eat the delciousness of piping HOT Pizza. And, YES it is STILL served out of that black serving pan. Obviously we ordered the breadsticks as well as a Large pepperoni and green pepper pizza. I must admit that they skip you out on the pepperoni, but it was still delious. Unfortunately, we heard that the 117th will be turning into a take-out only by the end of the year. So make sure you go and EAT IN before it turns- It's WELL worth it!"}
{"text":"I am glad that there are still a few Pizza Hut dine-in restaurants.  It is just feeling good to enjoy a freshly baked pizza in a pizza restaurant with comfortable seating.

I love Pizza Hut's pan-crust pizza.  It is just delicious!

I hope Pizza Hut pays more attention to well maintain its dine-in restaurants.  The carpet floor was always full of food leftovers and papers, etc.  The staff sat at a guest table to wipe cutlery.  Hmmm...I don't know what to say.  I just know I don't want to see the Pizza Hut restuarants disappear!"}
{"text":"Actually a 2.5

Came here with some friends for their lunch buffet. We arrived at approximately 11:50am. After we were seated the server told us the food would be available in 5 mins and ask if he could bring us some water. He came back with our water but there was some...stuff that was floating on top..yuck. 

The salad and pasta were ready but the pizza came out slowly one after the other. I kind wished they all come out at the same time cause pepperoni came out first and the Hawaiian/Meat Lover (the ones I wanted) came out much later. They also had an apple pizza available for dessert but it was pretty good. It was like a mix of a donut and apple pie. All we're missing is the ice cream. 

No one came to clear our table even though the plates were building up. Also needed to go up to pay."}
{"text":"Omg. We picked up a pizza from an online order, and the only good thing about it was that we only paid $8 for a large two topping. We ordered the \"hut favourite\" crust, which made it only on 3 of the slices- the rest ended up, not on the crust, but on the actual pizza. On top of that, when they sliced our pizza, they didn't slice it all the way....what the heck? This was not yummy. I would avoid this PH."}
{"text":"The pizza is always hot. The pizza tastes fresh and my order is always correct. If you sign up for the rewards you get like 20-50% off online all the time. The estimated times are pretty much on point every time and the staff and drivers are always friendly."}
{"text":"Terrible pizza. Im not sure how Pizza Hut came to be known as a \"great pizza place\", but this place is terrible. Over priced, no flavor, and small.

I honestly think a frozen pizza would have had the same quality, if not better than a Pizza Hut pizza

Never again."}
{"text":"If I could put no stars I would! I ordered 1 pizza and it's been over an hour and it's still not here. Not even a phone call to notify it's running late. 
This isn't the first time either. I've stopped ordering from Pizza Hut a long time ago, but my kids just had to have \"stuffed crust\". This is just Terrible."}
{"text":"This place usually does pretty well, but I'd recommend going somewhere else when it's busy. Pizza was ready 15 minutes after they said it would be ready and the quality was not up to the standard they usually have. Check out all that crust, where's the pizza?!
One star for this visit, but I gave them three since they generally have been good."}
{"text":"I order two pizzas one thin pepperoni one pan they are large. They did not deliver until10:15pm and they were out pan and told me they were delivering two medium pan instead. They only deliver one medium pan one large thin. The driver lied to the manager and said he deliver three. I did not receive these pizzas but my boyfriend only received two. I called up and she said I was lying and they deliver three. Before all this happen I called to ask how down load the app. Very rude. Very appalled to be call a liar."}
{"text":"Just called at 9:20pm on 11/27 and they told my brother they had an incident and can't take orders. I called back 5 minutes later and asked for delivery and a gentleman told me the system was down. And to call back in 20 minutes. I stated won't you be closed soon and he said yeah. Sounds like he just didn't want to make an deliveries. I will call corporate in the morning. They are so ridiculous. What kind of mess is this? If these people don't want to work they should just quit and look for work elsewhere. Absolutely absurd. Went to papa johns instead. Won't be going back and will make sure I let my friends/family know not to order from there either."}
{"text":"Well, this will be the last time I use this location of Pizza Hut. For the second time in a row, the order was late, food tasted nasty, and to top it off this time, I was treated to the staff yelling at each other and carrying on about other orders they screwed up. Be a little professional! The last thing that a customer who is waiting for their screwed up order wants to hear is you yelling about all the other orders you have gotten wrong. Ugh, my stomach still hurts!"}
{"text":"As soon as I walked in, there was two guys complaining about their order being incorrect.   I should had trusted my gut and checked my pizza before going home.  To my fault I trusted the employees, bad call.  I usually ordered the supreme but this time I wanted more so I decided to order the super supreme with an extra topping of sausage and the bacon with the cheese in the crust.  Well what a surprised.  The pizza I ordered and I counted, 9 green peppers, probably 3 sliced were covered in like 10 little bacon cuts. No olives whatsoever, like 12 mushrooms and 5 onion slices.  Instead of driving 20 minutes again to get my pizza , I decided to call.  They said they could re-make it or give me a 10 dollard credit for the next time.  Not only did they get my order incorrect but I was extremely angry that there was no damn olives, I chose the credit but for a fact, I would check the pizza next time and go to NYPD pizza."}
{"text":"This review is only for delivery service. I ordered from here a few times; my pizza arrived hot and just as I ordered. I don't think the Pepperoni Lovers has enough pepperoni on it - compared to other locations - but it still tasted delicious. I took off one star for this. 

My favorite is the Pan crust, but stuffed crust is a close second. Love the $5 special, as it makes the pizza more \"affordable\". I find the pizza quite pricey normally and the pies seem to be shrinking in size, but man, is it ever good :)"}
{"text":"Wife placed order for dinner for grandkids as we gave our AZ Cardnials tickets to daughter & son-in-law.  Wife called to check on order after it was 15 minutes late. She was told \"order going out door as we speak.\" After another 15-20 minutes she called again and this time was told \"remaking our order as it was given to another customers.\"  Finally showed up over hour late with nothing but a weak apology.... Piss Poor Customer Service if you ask me....."}
{"text":"Used online ordering system.  Had to wait 1:15 minutes  for delivery and then it was cold.  Called restaurant and they were not concerned about their service.  Will not buy from them again."}
{"text":"Cold pizza that arrived 1 hour 20 minutes after we ordered it. Never again will I make the mistake of ordering Pizza Hut in Madison. So many other, better, local choices."}
{"text":"I still don't  understand how Pizza Hut is still open!   Between the ore-fab cardboard known as a crust, the bland sauce and low quality ingredients I would have to be coming off a long fast to eat it... And then I would probably throw it up!

There are a lot of frozen pizzas that are better!"}
{"text":"WHAT A JOKE LOCATION! We called after no confirmation email about our order, and found out it was canceled. Was told they weren't allowed on the Westgate property, and was then told that they could deliver it to the gas station across the street.
 We were already charged and was told to resubmit the order and put our card down again. We did not get an email or a phone call still to update or say our order was canceled and refunded. Wasted 30 mins, save yourself the time and don't even bother with this place."}
{"text":"Came here tonight and got the most friendly service by an asian lady on thanksgiving sunday.  There were two servers in the restaurant and I was really hoping we'd get her.  Luck was on our side and we did get her.

Service was quick and she was good with suggestions.  They forgot to put pepperoni on our meat lover's and put beef even though we wanted chicken.  

I never got our server's name but she fixed it right away and kept checking to see if everything was ok.  Very talkative and I'm thankful we had her.

Thanks alot Ms!  You were great"}
{"text":"I always ordered and picked up without any problems.first time ordered for delivery bc didn't want miss the final game.anyway,had to wait like a hour and half to get the food.tried call them like 10 times but nobody answered!!!"}
{"text":"We got the worst delivery driver ever. He had our address & still didn't  have enough common  sense to use navagation, he called us for directions & when told to turn left he turned right then wanted us to meet him to pick up our order. UHh NO! That's why we wanted delivery. Domino's  workers are perfectionist compared to pizza hut."}
{"text":"We always get Pizza Hut from this location. 
It's always good, but a little skimpy on the toppings. Some pieces had no ham, some had one piece."}
{"text":"Typical Pizza Hut fare here. However, what compels me to write a review, (besides the power of christ) was the horrible customer service. 

I ordered a pizza at 6pm. I showed up at 625pm and paid for it. Apparently it wasn't done yet, even though I was quoted 15 minutes over the phone. So I waited in the store...............and waited and waited. Meanwhile every muthaF'er in Sun Prairie came in there and picked up their pizzas lickety split. There were even a few walk-in orders taken at the counter that came out before mine did. 

The young lady at the front desk was clearly a dipstick. She seemed not to notice my standing at the counter and glaring for several minutes. She also didn't seem to notice when I started to verbalize my dissatisfaction out loud. 

She just kept on moping around the front desk area with this dopey grin on her face handing off pizzas to anyone that walked in or drove up to the pick up window...............everyone except me!!! 

There were a bunch of sweaty dudes working in the back, and they were yelling at each other, and dropping the F bomb repeatedly. Obviously, there was a screw up of some sort going on, and I was the unlucky recipient. Booo. 

After 55 minutes of waiting she finally calls my name. No sorry, no thank you for waiting because we are retarded here, nothing. To top it off they were cold. They had been made up long ago and instead of shoving it up front like they did all the rest of their pizzas, mine was shoved off to the side. 

At first I thought I was on one of those MTV shows like Boiling Point, to see how long they could piss someone off before they exploded, but it wasn't anything that cool. 

Just a bunch of jerk offs with zero customer service skills. 

Next time I go slummin' I'll go to Lil' Caesars instead."}
{"text":"Around 8 PM my roommates and I are hungry, not wanting to cook, so we decide on pizza. This Pizza Hut is a stone's throw from our house and we have a coupon, sounds simple enough.

WRONG.

After ordering online, I pull up to Pizza Hut around 8:30 and walk up to the door.It's locked. Confused, I try the other door. Locked. There's a boy inside sweeping. He looks at me, I gesture to the door, and he then continues to sweep. Huh?
I walk back to my car and look up the phone number on my GPS, there is no answer, so I drive home. I get to the house and tell my roommates what happened, so we pull up the online order and see if we were able to order due to a glitch, since they were obviously closed. 9 PM closing time. It's now about 8:45 or so, and my phone rings as we are still looking at the computer. 
\"Hey this is... from Pizza Hut.. are you going to pick up your pizza?\"
Um...
I tried..
\"Okay.. so how long will it take you to get here?\"
Um...
5 minutes I guess...

I drive back and walk up to the door. The door is still locked, that kid in the corner is still sweeping. I knock loudly on the door and three people appear from the back kitchen area. 

\"Sorry about the mix up, we upgraded your order for you.\"
Open the box- instead of the Supreme Pizza Mia we ordered is a very old looking pepperoni stuffed-crust pizza.
Huh?
\"So the total is $16.25.\"
What? Is this happening?

.. Um I'm not paying for this...
Everyone looks at everyone awkwardly, but the kid in the corner keeps sweeping.
\"Oh.. Okay..hold on.\"
The man in a tie, who I assume is the manager goes into the back and grabs one of their new pasta dishes, and puts it on top of the unwanted pizza.
\"Tell you what- Dinner is on me today, miss, have a great night.\"
Um.. okay.. Thanks...
Never got an explanation for the bizarre first trip and more importantly never even got the pizza we ordered.

Drove back home."}
{"text":"Hit up this Pizza Hut and had a great meal.  Pizza was perfect and came out fast."}
{"text":"First pizza order in several years, aaaand it'll be the last. Ordered online & gave instructions to put pepperoni on top. They blatantly ignored it. Called just to let them know their employees did not fully read the ticket (i didn't want/ask for a credit). The girl argued with me then overtly lied by saying they made it properly. They don't pay attention to orders, have zero customer service skills, and management clearly doesn't care, as they only have 17 reviews and 98% of them are bad. Looks like they've had these problems for years now. Wish i would have read their yelp reviews before ordering."}
{"text":"I've haven't felt this finessed since I lost all my money in a Ponzi scheme. I paid 30 dollars for some room temperature \"hand tossed\" pizzas that were basically thin crust and a very mushy brownie that just fell apart that I had to wait for since they thought my name was something else yet they didn't bother to call it out since it is on the screen. I have worked at both dominos and Pizza Hut and I recommend you go to dominos every time. Ken, if you are reading this I would highly suggest you check in on your stores more often I'm sure you would be stunned at what you see."}
{"text":"I love the taste, quality of pizza huts ingredients. This is why I choose Pizza Hut every time. I work hard for my money too, so that I am able to eat at Pizza Hut. My orders are always more than $20-30 TOPS. Yesterday, customer service at this location sucked, and the employees here at this Glendale location ( 58th & bell) need reminder classes on customer service. If you messed up, own up to it and make it right. When I placed my order online after a hard day of work. I was excited to come back home, chill , watch a movie while I'm eating. But yet I had to wait an extra 15mins longer bc my pizza was not ready on time bc you guys gave it away to someone else. Not only that I had two orders so now that I'm waiting for the pizza to bake my other order is staying in the oven DRYING OUT. It wasn't the waiting even though it was an inconvenience to my time. It was that after I get home the rest of my order is dry and hard as if they left it under the oven. My teeth are sensitive and to bite down on rock is not enjoyable and not acceptable. I called in asked if they could bring me another one with a cookie for this whole messed up order. I was told no. Are you kidding me?  I live on 79th & union hills. Y'all are located on 58th Ave & Bell. I was tired, drained, and hungry. Y'all messed up my order. I didn't call in for this. Anyways, I'm done with Pizza Hut. I'll take my money somewhere else."}
{"text":"Place was out of everything. cups for water, paper plates, crush papers, Pepsi soda....
When talk to the manager he said \"look around we are too busy\" Well....4th July...off course you will be busy...need to place right order of supplies....he should attend some training."}
{"text":"Pizza Hut, what can be said?  When you're in the mood for Pizza Hut pizza, nothing else will satisfy the cravings.  This location has its problems, but so far I've always had a good experience with both the food and service (Note: I've always placed my order at the store and waited).  All in all, the place looks clean, food is good, and service is ok. I recommend a visit if you happen to be in the area."}
{"text":"The pizza was delicious. I ordered the hot dog pizza  and  veggie lovers pan pizza. The service was fast and friendly. Will come back again."}
{"text":"They're so slow. I ordered a pizza at 6:30 that said it would be ready by 7:20, by the time I go there it was 6 people waiting, one lady had been waiting for her pizza that she ordered at 5pm. I ended up leaving and had to cancel my order, was told that  my points would go back on my account so I could get my free pizza, once canceled I was told it would take 24-48 hours before I could get my points. So now I have to reorder pizza from a different location but this is terrible I will never order from this location again. The worker also dropped ingredients on the floor and picked them up to use them."}
{"text":"I can't remember the last time I ate at a Pizza Hut.  Minimum 15 years ago.  I decided to go with this choice last night because I wasn't in the mood to cook, and I'd remembered seeing commercials about Pizza Hut serving pasta and thought I'd give it a shot.  I jumped online (very convenient) and placed my order for chicken pasta alfredo and some parmesan wings.  I was surprised to see that the pasta came in two small containers instead of one large one as depicted in the commercial and on the website.  It looked smaller than as advertised.  It wasn't good.  Tasted like Pasta Roni.  Pasta Roni might be better.  The wings also weren't great.  I was kind of expecting them to taste like BW3's parmesan wings, but these had a bit of breading on them and weren't \"buffalo\" style at all.  I'll never make the mistake of eating at Pizza Hut again."}
{"text":"We frequently order pizza from this location. about a year ago the experience wasn't so pleasant. However, in the past year it's definitely turned around! Very pleasant staff and our to go order is always correct and ready on time."}
{"text":"Placed order for carry-out via web, order confirmed at 7:19pm to be \"ready for pickup at 7:35pm\".  Arrived at restaurant around 7:30pm, told it would be a few minutes. OK no problem. Pizzas weren't ready until 8:00pm!  Awfully slow service, and pizza's were under-cooked. Will not be going back. Way too many better choices for pizza in Charlotte."}
{"text":"I think this is the best Pizza Hut we have been to. The pizza was hot and fresh and not greasy. The skinny Club is rally good, the crust is perfect and buttery. We will come back here again for sure. Tiffany was nice and helpful."}
{"text":"The staff just doesn't have it together.   Good food but much better experiences at the Losee location."}
{"text":"My name is Matt and I am from new York, also I have a handsome profile pic.  Being from new York you could say I'm a bit of a pizza snob.  That's why I choose pizza hut.  Their sauce and stuffed crust reminds me of everything I miss back east, but sometimes I wonder if pizza hut may be better."}
{"text":"worst service in AZ i used to work here but quit after i saw employees drop food on the ground and still put in on the pizza... horrifying i know, ive seen if first hand since i work there, they cheat you out of deals and sell u old food do not go here"}
{"text":"This place does not deserve one star but Yelp makes me put a star but this store is so unorganized?? Why there's a line of people and everyone in the back is just talking anf forgetting about helping people!!! I order my pizza for a carry out and they told me 15 mins I wanted over 20 mins I left the store to use the restroom and came back by then it was already 30mins and my pizza wasn't done.... I ask the guy what was talking so long and he said my pizza was coming out and once he looked in the oven he said they haven't made it I was this is ridiculous so I left but this was the 3 time this has happened to me!!!! I will definitely not be coming back to this place this place can go to crap!!!!!"}
{"text":"Just close this one down. It is actually terrible. I have never made a yelp review before or even had an account. But i felt it was my responsibility as a fellow Toronto resident to warn all others.... 

2 Hours+ waiting for deliver. No one picks up the phone. Main pizzahut line tried to transfer us to the store 4 times, no answer each time. Even the main customer service hotline said it was ridiculous. Apparently this specific branch handles its own customer service, which is apparently none, since they don't pick up. 

This isn't even the first time they've been late. 
Never ordering from this store again. 

Do yourself a favor and NEVER order from this specific store.

Edit: 
So it finally arrived 130 minutes after the initial order. Customer service pizzahut told us it should be free, but the delivery man refused and said no free food. 
Just keeps getting better."}
{"text":"Great pizza with plenty of money saving deals and I've never had a problem with my order which has always been delivery. They tend to deliver within the specified timeframe and they always have a smile."}
{"text":"Wow, I wish I could give them 0 stars....

Last night, my boyfriend and I put in an order at 4:40 to be delivered at 7:00 pm. 7:00 arrives...no food. 8:00, 9:00...no food. Put in several phone calls and reached employees who told us again and again, that our food was just coming out and would be on its way. Finally got through to a manager, who said he would either comp this meal or the next order, and would drive the pizza and wings out himself (which, I do appreciate) immediately. Finally at 10:00, we have our food, 3 hours late. Too bad we received neither a comp for this meal or the next order--and no receipt!! We opened the pizza to find it swimming in grease. We ate it anyway, which was a huge mistake. What was supposed to be a nice evening was dampened by a dinner that didn't start till 10:00, and was absolutely ruined when I had to run to the bathroom an hour after eating to throw everything up. Never, ever ordering from them again. I'll stick to Papa Johns...."}
{"text":"Not satisfied with place at all, they were out of half there menu and we ordered beers and they weren't even served till our food was out. Asked to have the channel switched to the ball game and the guy said if I wanna watch go change the channel. 

Won't ever come back here"}
{"text":"Order 2 large pizzas, just got one ready after 20min, 2nd pizza was not put on the system even tho I pay both pizzas at the same time. I waited a total of over 45min for 2 pizzas. What a service, worst I ever gotten in a Pizza Hut location.  Look elsewhere for pizza and avoid this location."}
{"text":"Ugh! This place gets worse by the order and the customer service is horrible!! Whoever the pizza maker is clearly is not a cook or chef. Presentation is low quality and taste doesn't exist.  Latest experience..realized they burned my cheese stick order and I called back and the rude employee made it my fault for not checking the box. Needless to say I'll be headed to Weddington location and will spread the word."}
{"text":"over thanksgiving break, I received food poisoning from this location. I was told I would have to wait  to talk to Ashley and to hear 
back from the RGM (following monday)?????  still have received no call. with an outbreak or food poisoning this place takes no pride in cleanliness or food service.  whoever the manager  is, you should be fired including your management \"staff\". it appears you have no knowledge of the safety concerns of your guest."}
{"text":"Terrible service!
I came in with my daughter, sat at a table and waited for someone to take our drinks order. Finally someone comes after a while but tells me to \"hold on\", walks away to the kitchen without taking our order. So we left. As we were leaving the waitress comes out saying she will now take my order. How long does one have to sit around to even get a refreshment? 
They weren't busy. Only four tables with customers."}
{"text":"Called today to order a pizza was told they won't deliver to me. No reason why. Nothing. I wont order from them again. Their loss. Funny they used to deliver here. Scoffs .. Guess my money isn't green enough for them."}
{"text":"Brought the girls and ordered a meat lovers on thin crust to go. 20 minutes later we had a great large pizza and we ate the whole thing! Customer service here is great."}
{"text":"Placed an order for delivery and what I got was nothing like what I actually ordered. I don't see why pizza hut gives you the option of different toppings of each half of the pizza, when in reality they give you what they want not what you order.
Very upset with my order, I should've given the pizza back to the driver but he was gone by the time I opened the box.
I was able to eat one slice and had to get rid of the rest of the pizza :("}
{"text":"On two different occasions in the past three I have attempted to have a pizza delivered and have been told that \"we are not taking any more delivery orders to night. Both time I called before 10:30pm. The last time I finally got pizza delivered it took over 2.5 hours. The only explanation is piss poor management."}
{"text":"I get weekly emails form Pizza Hut offering me some kind of deal. Including this time, the last two attempts to use the coupon codes from the  emails this location refused to honor these codes. What's the purpose of me getting weekly emails with my local Pizza Hut doesn't accept the deals offered? Don't waste your time we Pizza Hut go to Jets or Marcos...better food better price."}
{"text":"Horrible experience! We just bought a new house so our address did not populate into the Pizza Hut online website. I wanted delivery, I called the store and explained that we wanted delivery but our address would not come up in the system he said he could take the order and he advised me that he could not honor the online prices over the phone, asked him for the manager Andy and he stated the same thing. I asked them how could I order online if my address won't come up? He said he couldn't help. I asked him for the persons name who answered the phone originally and he said I don't know.. how do you not know the person who answered the phone for your store? Bottom line customer service is horrible! I can't help that your system does not have an address of a new house that was built."}
{"text":"The Pizza's I ordered were terrible. Not at all what you would expect from a Pizza Hut. They seemed to be light on toppings and overcooked. The service was poor as well."}
{"text":"I ordered a pizza from this location last night. 30 minutes after the quoted ready time, I received the worst pizza I have ever eaten. Clearly no use of rings as there was a good 3 inches of crust at some points. As a former employee, it's a shame to see what management has done to this place. Start with the GM, work your way down, and replace everyone at this store, until then I will stay away from this store."}
{"text":"Very understaffed.  Disappointing. Pizza comes dry and very bad, feel sorry for them.  Pizza Hut HQ should address this."}
{"text":"Carlos just delivered our delicious pizza and let me tell you, that guy made my day! He was so happy and friendly and I wish I had more to tip him because like I said, he honestly made my day! You rock Carlos:)"}
{"text":"It seriously takes you a damn hour after my pizza is supposed to be delivered for you to call me and say you haven't had a delivery driver since 10pm? This entire store needs to be restaffed, remanaged because THEY SUCK AND MAKING PIZZA,CANT KEEP THEIR CUSTOMERS UP TO DATE OR HAPPY!!!!!! CLOSE THIS LOCATION AND START OVER."}
{"text":"This is a no dining area Pizza Hut. They have all of the familiar Pizza Hut items you know and love, but no seating area. They do a good delivery service and they have a speedy pick up counter. This is what I enjoy the most. Call or place an order on the internet and it's ready by the time you get there. I like to order via the mobile as I'm leaving work, by the time I am passing this place, pizza is ready! Easy squeezy."}
{"text":"I bought 2 medium pizzas (meat lover's and a custom) and both were received cold, barely any cheese or sauce, and the  toppings were stale-tasting. On top of that, the Pepsi I ordered was very warm. Lastly, the fodd didn't show up until 45-1 hour after ordering when given a 20-30 wait. Never gonna order from this location again."}
{"text":"Hit or miss. Sometimes we get the best and softest crust. Other times we get hard and under seasoned crust with barely any meat.

Amazing garlic crust.
New garlic and cheese rolls or knots are to die for. They are bite sized and covered in parmesan and garlic with a tad bit of cheese inside. So light, fluffy, and FLAVORFUL!!"}
{"text":"Ordered pizza for delivery, 40 min goes by and get a call from an employee saying our drivers car broke and we had to wait for another driver. Which okay I understand but then you leave my pizza sitting around for another hour instead offering a fresh pizza. Unprofessional and bad customer service. Then we called to cancel for how long it was taking and told us we couldn't cancel a cash order. So I sent the driver away with my hour old pizza and again no offer of an actual fresh one like we were going to pay for. The management and employees need some training on how to deal with situations like this. I was not rude or anything either."}
{"text":"If I could give a  negative star I would. Ordered pizza at 1 this afternoon and at 2:20 something I called to check up on the pizza cuz I got a text message it was out for delivery at 1:35 p.m. they said they canceled the order because they were out of garlic knots and that they tried to call us. Never received a call. They said it wasn't sent out for deliverly. So why the hell did I get a text saying it was??? Complete and udder bull."}
{"text":"Je sais que je ne devais pas m'attendre à de la grande gastronomie ou de la pizza fine en allant au buffet de pizza hut. C'est ma première visite à ce restaurant et le prix du midi etait raisonnable. Sur le buffet il y avait 5 sortes de pizza genre pan pizza, une sorte de pâtes, de la salade,et des desserts. Tout etait frais mais ça reste de la pizza à l'américaine sans trop de goût avec beaucoup plus de pâte gonflée que de garnitures. L'accueil et le service du personnel etait amical et professionnel. Restaurant propre et stationnement facile."}
{"text":"My sister ordered a medium pizza online with an expected wait time of 25 minutes, but after an hour and a half it still wasnt here. She calls down and they say it's on its way like they were just then sending it out, worst pizza hut in town."}
{"text":"This is clearly the best Pizza Hut, I don't know why it has such a low rating. They are always on time with my order and also the only Pizza Hut that actually gets all the sauce on the wings!!!"}
{"text":"This was the saddest Pizza Hut lunch buffet I've ever been to. The salad portion is strictly lettuce and 4-5 dressings to choose from. No toppings like cheese, croutons, vegetables, etc. Just lettuce. When it came to the pizza, the selection was poor, only hand-tossed (no thin crust at this location), and undercooked. Also, no cinnastix, really no breadsticks either, just more of something that resembled cut up crust with no real flavor. 

Definitely a sad afternoon for me, as Pizza Hut's buffet was a happy childhood past time. Thankfully, that wasn't at this Pizza Hut, or those memories probably wouldn't have been as bright."}
{"text":"Pizza sans sauce au tomate. Très sec.... Goute l'ail. C'est pas une pizza c'est un biscuit a l'ail. Dommage"}
{"text":"This place is horrible!

I had placed an order one day and they had messed it up the pizza was soggy and just disgusting to eat. So I called the store was put on hold for a while and never got ahold of anyone so I emailed the survey in and a few days later the management team called me from the store and tried to claim that it was MY fault for the order being messed up and I should of paid more attention to it and this and that. But after a while of going back and forth they credit me a Large one topping pizza. 

Fast forward....

My wife and I were lazy and figured we'd use the deal, so I called in placed the order and we waited. After about an hour our pizza guy got here and he hands me the pizza. On top of the box was the receipt and he snatches it off the top and crumbles it up (at this point he still hasn't said one thing to me) he then turns around throws the receipt on the floor in yard and storms the hell off. I mean what the hell. Not sure what his attitude and deal was maybe he hates his job? I don't know. 

The pizza sucked anyways waste of time. And the management is horrible at this place. I'll stick to dominos."}
{"text":"Worst Pizza Hut ever.  Management hung up on me after I called to let them know the pizza they had just delivered to me was not what I ordered. Manager told me I couldn't have ordered spinach on the cherry bomb pizza because it didn't come with it. I told him I had the confirmation email and then his story changed to they were out of product so I couldn't have ordered it.  After going back and forth for a minute he finally begrudgingly said he would credit my account for the next time. I said that would be fine if there was a next time because every time I order a pizza from this store it is ALWAYS wrong. He then hung up on me. How unprofessional.  Order from Napoli's instead. I thought I would give pizza hut one more try due to the new menu. NEVER AGAIN.  Oh yeah and the pizza tasted like cardboard. Steer clear of this one."}
{"text":"Terrible! Holy cow the delivery service is the slowest I have EVER experienced. Online said 25-35 min and it's been 90 and still no pizza! This is not the first time this has happened. I guess I just want to be optimistic...never again. I call the store and he says that the pizza is on the way, and should be here any second. It's been 30 minutes and still nothing. Ugh! Update: I called the store again and they said my pizza should have been delivered. They don't know where it is! My options were to either wait another hour and a half to be delivered or come to the store to pick it up. NEVER AGAIN!"}
{"text":"This is not a place that I would ever go again, at least not for a sit-in. I had gone to this place a few times to get take-out wings and pizza on several occasions, but that was about it.

Then one day I decided to have the bar on a night out with my boyfriend. The salad bar was great but some of the toppings were hard because they had been sitting out for too long. The waitress we had was openly flirting with my boyfriend, talking to him in a seductive voice, and even came over to chat with him when I left to go to the bathroom. On top of it, she hardly paid any attention to me when I would ask for her assistance or talk to her, and when she talked to me it was in a harsh voice and she wouldn't even make eye contact with me. It was very rude and disrespectful.

Furthermore, It was almost closing time and I wanted to take two slices of pizza home with me so I asked for a to-go box but the waitress absolutely would not allow it, despite the fact that they were closing the bar and would throw everything away. So not only did she fail to give me time to finish those two pieces of pizza, but she took the plate from me without even asking if I was finished.

I've never been back to this Pizza Hut after that occasion and I never will be."}
{"text":"This Pizza Hut location has really gone downhill over the years. In the past two years, they've started skimping on ingredients. So much so that I've gotten several pizzas that looked almost bare due to the lack of cheese and sauce on them. I keep complaining, and they keep giving me free pizzas, but it's just not worth it to spend my money there any longer. Please go somewhere else!"}
{"text":"I came to this one cause the one on 35th ave and camelback never had my pizza ready on time. I ordered it online and it said it would be ready by 5:13 I got there at 5:20 just in case, it was not ready and the guy that greeted me said give it a few more minutes. It took another 15, they must have put it in the oven as soon as I got there. No Parmesan cheese and not even an apology!"}
{"text":"Pizza Hut is one of my favourite pizza places. The service at this location is great, the staff is really friendly. Come here usually once a week with my family. Loved the $5 deal that Pizza Hut was having."}
{"text":"Not even worth this one star. The service is completely slow and the restaurant had no customers whatsoever. There was also so many flies it was hard to eat inside. I will never visit this location again."}
{"text":"I have a BIG issue with this site on Charleston and Bruce. That problem has to do with customer privacy and confidentiality! I ordered my pizza online so I could pick up my pizza, which is convenient because I didn't have to wait, but right when I walk in I see my wife's full name plastered on a big screen tv hung on top of the right corner of he wall behind the counter.. you never know what kind of person could look up your name to possibly create identity fraud or harassment situations.. besides the fact that it was the first thing I saw coming in, they had no menu displayed anywhere which brought my attention immediately to my wife's full name. 

I would definitely recommend taking down the person's last name which will prevent everyone from seeing it and protect their privacy. An alternative way to do it is by using First name only and last initial, or last 4 digits of phone number. 

Please find new ways to market your product more conveniently"}
{"text":"I ordered a complicated order and its late on a Friday. Order was delivered quickly and accurate and it was really great. First time ordering from here and I gotta say best pizza I've had from a Pizza Hut ever. Thanks guys!"}
{"text":"I love this Pizza Hut!! I've been going here for over a year but this is my first check in. I went last night. I absolutely love the customer service. Mainly from the manager Lane and the cook Gena. They always make me feel welcome and make sure my order is to my specifications. I am a picky person too. LOL!! I have been there so often I call them my \"Pizza family\". I just love this Pizza Hut!!!! I highly recommended this place."}
{"text":"The delivery in Pizza the Hutt is always slower than I'd like.  However, the pizza is freaking delicious.  Hot, cheesy pepperoniness of awesome with crust of cheesiness of awesome.  I cry while eating it, thinking of the poor Gamorrean eaten by the Rancor in Return of the Jedi.  He did squeal like a pig."}
{"text":"Theyre okay, but tonight after working 5 days in a row i didnt feel like walking to get anything so i decided to get delivery. This place was open til 11. I gave them a call i wanted the personal pan pizza meal which comes with a drink, and 3 bread sticks. Well the guy didnt know what that was i needed to tell him what that came with when i dont work there. He then told me after i put my order in that it was 5 bucks and i needed 10 dollars for delivery. So i said i wanted the personal pan with extra cheese, a drink, and an order of 5 bread sticks. The guy asked if i was paying with cash or credit i told him cash he told me that its $13.49, and that it would be 35 to 40 minutes. Which it was 40 minutes, and the guy showed up which he gave me my personal pan pizza, and then gave me a large box, but no drink. I didnt ask for a large bread stick i asked for the 5 piece and a drink.which they didnt give me. I usually get good service but the person tonight was rude might be awhile before i give them my services again"}
{"text":"This place is horrible. I do not recommend them at all. We ordered our pizza, pizza delivery man got to our address, he said that our gate was not open. I told him that the gate is open until 7 o'clock and he insisted that I was wrong. I double checked, and the gate was open. Then he butt dialed me accidentally, and said, \"what a bunch of effing a holes, this is effing stupid.\"
He's not realize that I heard that, but I did. And I was highly offended. I cannot believe that they pay these drivers, and allow them to go out and deal with the public when they have such an attitude. Then, I called to complain about this, and was not even offered a refund on my meal. At the end of the night, I decided take a bite in the my cookie, that was completely burnt. Please do yourself a favor, call Sardella's for pizza"}
{"text":"I will not order another pizza from this location.
I ordered a pizza online at 7pm and was told that it would take 1hr and 30min to ready for pick up.
I get there before 8:30pm (I should have checked the pizza before I left too trusting) picked up my pizza, got home, got comfy, opened up the box and was disgusted. The pizza looked like it has been sitting in the warmer for hours. it was dry and tasted like the cardboard. 
It was a waste of my money.
The only good part was the chocolate chip cookie pie that I ordered. I ate that and called it a night. I work 2 jobs and was too tired to call or go back up to the store seeing that I had to be up that night in another 2hrs  to go to the next job.
I won't order from them again.
I work too hard for my money to be wasted."}
{"text":"This is horrable.I called and asked if they were open 1 minute before we arrived,and they were closed,all the other pizza huts were open."}
{"text":"I do not care for this Pizza Hut. The restaurant always feels tired and dirty. I only stop when I need a quick bite to eat before running some errands in Macedonia or seeing a movie at the Cinemark, so I usually only have the lunch buffet. There is a waitress named Nicole who has worked there for years and is so unfriendly she makes me uncomfortable. She never smiles, and she always makes it obvious that anything she does for you is an imposition. As a matter of fact, she rarely even speaks. Unless you're in a group of really handsome men, forget receiving anything other than her abrupt, unfriendly attitude."}
{"text":"First visit, dine in. Very clean, nice waitress. Much larger than it looks from the outside.Food was good, but wish they had a salad bar. I am much closer to the Stow-Kent location, so this was probably my only visit."}
{"text":"This is the best Pizza Hut in Northeast Ohio. All the servers are friendly and helpful. The lunch buffet is almost always tasty and hot. Always love the salad bar. The best thing about them is they're consistent. If there's an off day, you don't mind because it's normally excellent. I'm there 4-5 times a month."}
{"text":"Order took over 1 hour to deliver. Pizza was cold and tasted stale. Asked for refund, manager is an idiot. DO NOT GO HERE!"}
{"text":"I ordered a pizza on the web. Was automatically given this location for delivery. In fact, I've ordered delivery from them many times in the past 4 years. 2 hours later and the pizza hasn't shown up. I call the store (even got the number from my confirmation email) and they try to tell me that 1) they \"never got the order\" and 2) they don't deliver to my house. Absolute B.S. The young lady I spoke with was rude and dismissive. She tried to tell me that the Lake Wylie store delivers to my house. That store is 13 miles away and IN ANOTHER STATE. I can only assume that 1) Pizza Hut hires incompetent web developers or 2) the local staff were too lazy to do their job and canceled my order. Either way, I will never be eating from here again."}
{"text":"Only speaking of the Saturday dinner buffet they have at this location because we normally don't eat Pizza Hut anymore. The salad buffet was pretty messy, all the foods mixed in together. The pizza on the buffet sat there for at least an hour. 2 of the pizza where there when we got here and the same 2 are still sitting there so they may have been out longer. It took forever to get drinks and when we did we had to flag down different people to get them. Our plates stacked up on the table until we left. They must be really understaffed or have pour management with their employees."}
{"text":"I am giving this location a two start strictly because they answered the phone and got my order correct and delivered on time.

However the cheese pizza was awful. I don't know what made it so bad maybe it was over cooked but I could barley eat one piece. 
I will not be ordering from here again."}
{"text":"At 8:30 on Friday night, after holding for almost 10 minutes and being hung up on, I was told they were not taking any orders at that time.  Their ovens were running behind as were deliveries.  W H A T?
So let me get this straight, Pizza Hut made ALL the money they needed to make today so they just not going to take any more orders.  UNBELIEVABLE!!!!!  Pizza Hut just lost a 30 year customer."}

{"text":"All I wanted to do was order pizza. I called one location based on MapQuest trying to find the closest Pizza Hut next to me. The guy on the line was very nice and courteous and sent me to another Pizza Hut location. After that I was transferred to a female at another location and gave them my address. She said they don't service my location and transferred me to another location. I was then transferred to a third Pizza Hut location and the guy over there told me to contact another location which was in fact the second location I was transferred to before the third one. At which place point he was going to find another location for me when I told him the number he gave me was the one I was transferred from. He hung up. Pizza Hut PLEASE get your act together and realize where addresses are on a map. It's not complicated or hard to find my address or to look at where an address is and if you don't know or have the ability to service.  At least have some proficiency as to where the addresses lie.  I don't know what's going on and think the robots will win...."}
{"text":"My fiancé went to watch the football game on January 10, 2016 at a friends house, so my 4 yr old and I decided to order Pizza Hut. I haven't had Pizza Hut in years because it was not that great the last I had it, but the little boy wanted some. I did an online delivery order off their $5 Flavor menu. I got a med pizza with pepperoni, two orders of boneless wings (BBQ and garlic Parmesan ). There's a timer on their website that countdown and your food should arrive by that time. It was 45 min and they delivered 5 min before that time. The driver was very polite. The food was very hot, fresh, and good quality. Very delicious. So delicious we ordered again this past Saturday the food again was very good. We did the same menu($5 Flavor menu), but this time we got two pizzas one pepperoni and one with chicken with honey Sriracha drizzle sauce, boneless wings (BBQ and Sweet Chili), and chocolate chip cookie pie.  The food again was very delicious top quality. We did carry out this time around."}

Spent $80 and half not delivered. Asked for refund told no!  Bad service all around !  Called the DM pat Breem and he hasn't even called back. Shame we love their food however not good business at all. Give me my money back. Have filed a complaint with visa"}
{"text":"Honestly I hadn't had Pizza Hut in a long time and I really like their pizza. Particularly the Hawaiian despite any debate about whether pineapple belongs on pizza or not, it always has a place on my pizza. Good for takeout."}
{"text":"Just came home with my carry out pizza, took a bite and found a piece of plastic. Called and complained and the worker is stating that there isn't any plastic around the work area. Well I guess i happen to produce pieces of plastic wrap from my damn mouth. Thanks, you just lost a customer not because of your food but the attitude of your workers."}

{"text":"Food is ok but be careful they rush and sometimes mess up your order.  Also the place is disgusting, the tables are all metal and dirty, the restrooms are filthy, the girls restroom sink and toilet looks like someone puked in it and they don't want to clean it when I told them."}
{"text":"I have being coming here and it's been a pleasure until you get rude service. Plus I tried to pay with $100 bill and she points to the sign saying we don't expect them. I then pay with my card (no pin btw) and she never asked me for my ID. The same  sign saying no $100 bills also say \"Please show a valid ID on all credit and debit card transactions\" so not only are they rude they also don't know how to do there job."}

When the driver arrived he didn't have my soda saying they were completely out. No one called to inform me or let me know when I called them. Then the driver still charged me for the soda! Needless to say the pizza is Luke warm. I tried calling back to speak to the manager and someone picked up the phone and left it sitting then hung up on me. I will be contacting them tomorrow. Totally disappointed!"}
{"text":"Pizza Hut \"Express\" inside Excalibur.  Not really \"express\" since nothing was pre-made and under the warmer.  The upside is that my breadsticks were cooked fresh so why am I complaining?"}

{"text":"I used to come here a lot. Since I've been trying to eat better, I've avoided this place like the plague. 

The food is good; the wings are pretty much perfect and the pizza is good. 
My complaint, though, is that the pizza is ridiculously greasy. I could probably soak it up into 5 napkins for one piece of pizza.

Every time I have ever been here the staff has been really nice. They are pretty good about keeping it clean in there. They really should refill their tea urn more often."}
{"text":"After my atrocious experience in January, I spoke with the store's new manager. She assured me that if I gave them another chance, I'd have a different experience, and offered me a credit. It took me a month to even consider the idea, and another couple of weeks to warm up to it, but today we caved and gave them a shot. And I was pleasantly surprised.

I called in my order rather than placing it online, because of the credit, and the person who took my order was friendly. Delivery time was quoted at 30-40 minutes, and it arrived promptly. So maybe they really have made some big changes. The pizza itself is, you know, Pizza Hut pizza; if you've had it before, you know what to expect there. I do like the garlic parmesan sauce option, and the new crushed tomato sauce is more to my taste than their traditional marinara.

So, there you have it. The Etna Pizza Hut seems to be under new management and you will probably actually get your order, and not be accused of lying by the staff."}

The first time they were running an hour behind which left my delivery at now 2 hrs....the manager said \"I don't know what to tell you....its on its way\" did not even offer a discount. If there were any other pizza joints around here I would choose them over this pizza hut! Service here is HORRIBLE!!"}
{"text":"Long hours and exams are strenuous to the mind and body. Good food replenishes the energy needed for the long days. At the start of my winter break, my friends and I decided to order takeout from Pizza Hut and St. Louis. At Pizza Hut, we ordered a pizza with mushroom, sausage and pepperoni as toppings. The pizza was dry and was bland. My friends were disappointed with the pizza. Pizza Hut was did not impress. With dry pizza, the final score is 2 out of 5 stars. I would not recommend this to anyone looking for pizza to eat."}

It's just pizza - How do you manage to get the order wrong 3 of the last 4 times especially when i'm entering the information online?  This time, when I went to pickup my order it wasn't there. A delivery driver took it to someone else. I got a very insincere 'sorry' and had to wait 15-20 minutes while they remade it.  Check your order before you leave!"}
{"text":"i wouldn't normally review a pizza hut, but this one seems to need a review. when i walked in, the place stunk. not like bleach or other cleaning supplies, but stinky in a way i cannot adequately describe. it was bad. it seems they forgot that even though this is a takeout/delivery location with no sit down dining room, customers still have to go inside sometimes - like when they pick up their pizza, but i digress.

we order from this pizza hut once or twice a year. the pizza is very consistent, and definitely not the best in the valley. not sure what's going on with the cheese, but it never gets stringy and just kinda stays in globs on the top. weird. this weekend's pizza was overly saucy. overall i guess it was about what i expected and i'm not sure why we ordered it. i'm not looking forward to returning anytime soon. on another note, i was entertained by the sign on the door that said the results of a recent area audit revealed they needed to remind delivery drivers that they aren't allowed to have passengers when making deliveries. +1 star for entertainment value - and that's being generous."}
{"text":"Super fast, efficient, Hard working team.  I haven't ordered from a Pizza Hut in some time.  I decided to get a personal pan in both supreme and Parmesan with chicken & spinach.  Both pizzas were delicious.  At a later time, I used my survey coupon for medium pizzas from my pervious order.  Not disappointed.  Highly recommend.  I like the tv screen inside which tells you when your order is ready (like airport style)."}
{"text":"I used to hate Pizza Hut... but my wife convinced me to try it.  I am now a regular patron of this establishment; I have never had an issues with it.  The crust is tasty (unlike back in the day), the ingredients seem good and its not overly salty (like Howies).  Nearly every time I order I can get a free side for a small amount of due diligence.  Hardly amazing but never having problems with a place like this is a sight to behold :)"}

{"text":"It's a Pizza Hut. Service may be slow much of the time, but it's generally friendly. I've yet to have a BAD experience here, and that says much in my book.
The dining room is almost always clean, and that means even more than speed of service! After a week of feeling like every public business experience has made me want to punch someone, it has been a delight to stop somewhere where I was acknowledged from the moment I walked in the door and when my meal took longer than expected, the server keep me updated.
While I can dredge up reasons to complain, they are more than outweighed by being a pleasant way to start a new week. I am glad this has become my nearest Pizza Hut so it is the one I have most reason to frequent!"}
{"text":"I've been to many pizza huts and this one is the best one hands down. The staff is super friendly and i've only had one problem where they didn't put the right toppings on my pizza.

Management is definitely doing something right! Keep up the good work!"}

{"text":"We have been very pleased with the quality of the food, timeliness and outstanding customer service at this location. We have never had to wait longer than twenty minutes for an order to be prepared, and the employees care a great deal about your satisfaction with the pizza. They are always friendly, professional and courteous. Just yesterday I arrived a few minutes early to pick up my order and I went in to pay, asking if the gentleman would wave out the window to me when my order is ready since my baby was in the car. Instead, he brought the order out to my car for me. Little things like that really score customer service points with me. Would definitely recommend this location."}
{"text":"Horrible service! Called them 10 mins after my order was supposed to arrive. They said they couldn't find my name at first then all of the sudden, they found my name and order. Was told I was at the top of the list and my order would arrive any second now. Waited another 15 minutes for it to arrive."}
{"text":"We went to this Pizza Hut for lunch while shopping in Ross Park. My daughter had a free pizza coupon from a reading program. I was disappointed in this one.

On the plus side our server was very nice and helpful, and the pizza was decent. It's basic chain-style pizza, so nothing too exciting but PH Pan pizza is not bad. It's at least a little different. They have a new menu which seems pretty good with a lot of new options, including \"drizzles\" for the crust. My issues is that the hand-tossed crust now automatically comes wth garlic drizzle which I didn't see mentioned. It would've been nice if that was mentioned before I ordered it (especially since it is a \"new feature\"). The drizzle was not that good.

The place was nearly empty but they managed to mess up our order and the order of a table next to us (we ordered at roughly the same time). Apparently they were \"slammed\" with orders at the same time but based on how many people were there 

The actual restaurant is in bad shape. It looks like the interior hasn't been refreshed since it opened years ago. And it is just not particularly clean. The bathroom was  disgusting with flies all over it. Even the brand new menus were sticky with sauce already. Clearly they don't value cleanliness at this location. It makes me wonder what the kitchen looks like. On second thought maybe I shouldn't think about that. 

While I may be back to a Pizza Hut, it certainly won't be to this one. It needs a lot of help."}
{"text":"I was really craving pizza one day at work, so I decided to try this pizza hut one more time. I ordered by 10am,they said pizza would be there by 10:40, but pizza wasn't there until 11:30. 

Avoid this place if possible."}

The female in a rude tone of voice said they take orders til they close.  Okay good.  I said I wanted two pizzas.  She asked for my info and where it's going to be delivered to.  I mentioned it was going to be at Sunset Station Hotel and Casino.  She said I don't know the address.  I said ok, I'll look it up for you.  (Keep in mind, if you walk out the back door of the restaurant, you'll see a giant hotel tower that says Sunset Station.  The casino is literally on the same block.) I gave her the address.  She asked where I would be for the drivers info.  I mentioned I could wait in Valet.  She said we don't know where that's at.  Finally I cancelled the order.  The female on the phone did almost everything in her power to not take an order.  Her tone of voice was very rude.  I would've accepted her telling me that it was late and she would not take on any more orders.  Won't ever bother this female again."}
{"text":"This Pizza Hut delivers quick and the food preparation is on point. I order here normally once a week and the only constant issue this particular Pizza Hut has is remembering to bring dipping sauces. 9 out of 10 orders arrive missing these vital additions. Trying to remedy this problem by ordering additional sauces just results in a waste of extra money on sauces that will not arrive."}
{"text":"Other Pizza Hut's have made me dairy free pizzas with no problem and the pizza was delicious, for some reason this Pizza Hut can't get it right. Also charged me for extra sauce and my pizza barely had any. I gave them a second chance to make the pizza right and ordered another pizza and they couldn't.
Very disappointed"}

{"text":"Wow... who would've thought ordering a pizza could ruin your night. Called in to order a pizza and \"James\" (at least that's what the \"supervisor\" said his name was) answered the phone. You would have thought I was his long lost enemy. I cannot believe how rude he was just to create an order. I NEVER leave reviews and I am fairly patient person but WOW. What a jerk he was. I asked to speak with someone else. The supervisor came on and said I could call back Tuesday to speak with her boss about it... really? You can't handle it.. just sad"}
{"text":"Got my order wrong. When we went inside to get it, it smelled like stinky feet. The stench didnt go away the whole time we were there waiting for them to remake the pizza. If i had had to eat there, i coulda lost wt cuz i woulda lost my appetite from that smell. So, we waited 15 more minutes, again...while they made it a 3rd time. The manager came out and explained that there were 5 new ppl being trained, and they had made it wrong again the 2nd time. She and the cashier apologized up and down--even offered to comp our meal, which we had already paid for, or get a credit for next time, or a bottle of pop. I chose the pop. I would have only given it 1 star if the manager and cashier hadn't been so apologetic. But, they did waste almost an hour of my evening waiting in line to get my food, then waiting while they tried to figure out what to do, then waiting for them to remake it twice."}
{"text":"This express location was super fast. I was on my way home and had the fiancee call in an order. The pizza had just been boxed when I walked in the door, about 5 minutes faster than had been estimated over the phone. There was no line and I had paid and was on my way in about two minutes. Great service."}
{"text":"This location has PH's modern look and very clean and in good repair. There was a little bit of a line when I arrived but the staff moved everyone through quickly. The were also very courteous. 

As for the pizza, well it's Pizza Hut, so you know you're going to get some good eats."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery for the $5 specials way better than little Cesar's and Dominos. Med 1 topping pizza and order of the boneless wings way better than the other two. Thank you will order again soon"}
{"text":"This pizza hut is just horrible because they always burn my toppings on the pizza which I don't understand why? so, I decided to order pasta instead but found a hair inside my pizza which is disgusting. I am not ordering from this location again....."}
{"text":"Tried to order 48 wings and was told I could only get one flavor of sauce with them. Apparently that's the new policy. I hate to say it but this policy may be the down fall to Pizza Hut. I know everybody at the office was up in arms when we tried to order lunch today and will not be calling Pizza Hut anytime soon."}
{"text":"Sat here and patiently waited 2 hours for a 45-60 min quoted delivery time. Finally called and was told that they contacted the police because my credit card was reported stolen. Um no. It was not. And somehow, they managed to charge my \"stolen\" credit card. Second time this store has messed up my order and left me waiting without a call. First time it happened I called to check up on it and was hung up on by the so-called manager. Get your shit together. Will not be ordering again."}
{"text":"I should have stayed home and made pizza myself. Would have been faster. Online order for pickup said the pizza would be ready at 8:06PM - it is now 8:45PM. It is total chaos and there are 10 other people standing around while the employees hide in the back so they don't have to admit to customers the pizza is late. Once I hailed them down they said 13 minutes. It has been 20. I'm not optimistic this pizza ever shows up."}
{"text":"Horrible customer service and delivery. I ordered a pizza over an hour ago, Called about 40 min into it to check up and said it was on the way tried to give current phone number but dumb guy kept insisting this driver has \"15 yrs of experience\" and knows the ins and outs of this city. Yet this moron couldn't drive around the corner and get the right apt. Manager did not try to make it right at all, very un satisfied. Pizza Hut is my favorite pizza but I will def not be getting it for a long time if at all."}
{"text":"If I could give zero stars I would. Nothing better than not fresh, cold pizza, wings and dessert, right?! Not to mention the not received breadsticks.... so I just got home to eat my food I ordered an hour and 45 minutes ago. Get to the store after my order should be ready, and one of my pizzas had been burnt. So, I waited for it to be cooked. I got a drink for my trouble. Then, the pizza gets done....the lady (holding my receipt with everything I ordered on it) brings part of my order. I remind her I had dessert, another pizza, and a 2 liter. Get those and leave....forgot about my breadsticks. Almost home; go back to get them. No breadsticks. \"We'll credit you the breadsticks.\" Oh thanks.....credit for what I paid for and didn't receive. Above and beyond. Also, at least 3 other customers were having problems with their orders being right and timely. Ridiculous"}
{"text":"Got a large hand tossed cheese lovers wth garlic flavor crust and basalmic drizzle, and the smores brownie. The pizza was probably the best pizza I've had in months. And I eat a lot of pizza. The delivery man was prompt and the food was warm and perfectly ready to eat. The only complaint I have is that the smores brownie had zip toasted marshmallows. The marshmallows were there. And hard. Like stale. But not toasted. The brownie is very difficult to cut and very sticky and messy to eat. I won't be getting it again. But otherwise happy with this experience"}
{"text":"I am so disappointed after purchasing pizza from this Pizza Hut. This was our first time ordering from this location and our last. We placed our order online and when we arrived to pick it up, it was wrong. We ordered a medium pan pizza and they gave us hand tossed. They offered to remake our food but we didn't have time to wait 20 minutes. The cashier blamed the cook and said he read the order wrong. I'm ordering from Papa Johns. They get my pizza right."}
{"text":"First time at this location and I was pleasantly surprised!  Despite the bad reviews from other people, this was a really nice experience.  The pizza was ready in 14 minutes (that's fast for pizza!) and the counter guy was very friendly and polite.  He even checked to make sure my order was correct before I left.

At home eating now and the pizza is just super yummy!  The cheese sticks aren't the best, but it's just the side.  The cinnamon sticks are rather good as well.  But I'm rather happy about the pizza since my Pizza Hut experiences are rather mixed."}
{"text":"I placed an online order for 2 pizza I received them in 35 minutes. pizza was hot, fresh and tasty I enjoyed it. I have ordered from them in the past with the same results. However time frame varies on the weekend  closer to an hour."}
{"text":"Just ordered 2 medium pizzas I WILL NEVER ORDER FROM PIZZA HUT AGAIN. No words needed see pictures attached of a MEDIUM pizza! It's literally the size of a personal pan, it was sliding around in the box! Just ridiculous!"}
{"text":"this particular pizza hut is the worst one we've ever ordered from! They always mess up our orders, either delivery OR carry out!!! They NEVER remember to give us our sauces that we PAY for, and last night (halloween night) we ordered our pizza and bread sticks at 8:13pm and at 9:50pm we finally got our order delivered..We had to call twice to see where they were...the first time they lied to us and said that the order had gone out and should be there any minute..so we waited about 20 mins (note the pizza hut is only 5 mins away..) and called again..this time a different person answered and said that the order had been over looked and was \"coming out of the oven right now\". well they got here about 5 minutes later and ALL of our food was cold! not even the slightest bit warm...COLD and none of the sauces were delivered..and we ordered extras. This is not the only time these mess ups have happened..this is about the 4th time and we are now DONE with ordering from them. NOT IMPRESSED!"}
{"text":"HORRIBLE! DISGUSTING!  Horrible service! Waited 10 mins before having to ask for a menu! Then another 10 mins for my drink order to be taken! The table was sticky and filthy? The washroom was ABSOLUTELY ATROCIOUS! Puke in the urinal that has not been cleaned. Overflowing on the ground, no soap in the dispenser and smelling stank as all heck! NEVER coming back here again!"}
{"text":"Came to pick up 12 pizzas for an event. Staff welcomed me and made small talk while we waited. Pizzas were hot and fresh and the place was immaculately clean. Good specials too."}
{"text":"This Pizza Hut is by far the worst I've ever been to. Called in an order, my husband goes 20 minutes later to pick up and they haven't even started it yet. Even though the wait time was 20 minutes. Then tonight I do an online order for breadsticks and personal pan pizza. The breadsticks are hard as a brick. They were def not freshly baked. They have been sitting out ALL day. Even my dog had trouble trying to chew it. We are done with this location."}
{"text":"Rudest interaction of customer services I have ever had . I always call Papa Johns as they are closer. My husband likes Pizza Hut so I said \"what the heck\" and went on line set up an account and placed and order . First I placed the order at 6:00pm on a Sunday .. It said I got free breadsticks but wouldn't allow it as I ordered a special.. No biggie... So I place my order on line and get a receipt saying my pizza would be here at 11:59pm.  I thought \"ok I'm sure they're busy with it being a big football night but this is a mistake\".. So I called I waited a while and finally a girl got on the line who was the rudest person I have ever spoke with .. ( I deal with people on the phone all day so would rather give praise than a complaint any day) She rushed through her greeting, not that I could understand a damn thing she was saying ... All I caught was some slurred , ghetto half asses attempt at saying \"pick delivery, carry out? \" I said hey I know you're busy but I think there is an error I placed and order on line and it says my food won't get here till 11:59pm.. She said \"that's because delivery has a 3-4 hour wait ... (REALLY WTF? Who would order a pizza at 6:00 and be cool with getting it at midnight)  I said, \"well an hour I get but can you please cancel my order \" .. She started yelling to someone in the background and said \" your orders void, there ain't no charge on the card\" ... I said ok great as long as I wont be charged ... She said \"there ain't no charge... And hung up on me .. Well fuck you Pizza Hut .. There is a charge and I will be calling your manager tomorrow to make sure it's removed (as I get its a Sunday) and then your corporate office to compliment them on their half assed shitty customer service... Who the hell would order a pizza at 6 and want it at 12:59pm ? Why would you even place that order ??????I don't eat pizza much but i will choose Papa Johns any day over that shitty service ... Get it together !"}
{"text":"Delivery review time!!
Great super wonderful!!
Thank you for being a great delivery person!! It's a playoff night but you made it here in great time!!
Idk your name BUT you delivered a great pizza and we are happy!!"}
{"text":"Just another pizza hut but i like the service this place and they are quick and friendly..."}
{"text":"I miss our old Pizza Hut in Henderson. This location can never get it right. Once ordered a pizza with light sauce, and got no sauce. :("}
{"text":"Was disappointed for the 3rd time in a row. There will not be a 4th. Ordered 2 hand tossed pizzas and a few other things. The crust was like a pizza stone. The driver also couldn't be bothered to even pull the items out. He just opened the bag and stared at me. Horrible pizza as well as service."}
{"text":"The pan crust here is the BEST.  I always get a half meat lovers / half cheese lovers with extra sauce.  Fantastic."}
{"text":"This place's service is so bad it's beyond my imagination. I have been a pretty loyal customer for the past couple years despite the extremely slow delivery. Lets just say that this place never delivered my pizza according to the time estimate given online. So for the past few times, my pizza will arrive on average an hour and half after ordering. This isn't a total deal breaker for me because the pizza made here is usually good.

I ordered a little late today so instead of ordering 2 hours ahead, i did 40 minutes and chose carryout. The online time confidently estimated that i will be able to pick it up after 18 minutes. I know its BS so i didnt go there until 40 minutes after I placed the order. When I got there, no one was at the front so I stood there and just chillaxed for about 5 minutes. In that 5 minutes, i could hear these two workers just went berserk with cuss words. It was actually pretty funny but that just shows you the quality of the management here. 

This girl finally showed up. She obviously didnt want to be there. After i gave her name for the pick up, she literally went silent for an extremely long time. I was like, soooooooooooo, then all of sudden, she said to me \"your pizza is either not yet cooked or cooking, 18 minutes.\" I didnt know what to say so I was like ok? Then she proactively said to me did you want to cancel your order. At this point, i have lost all my appetite. I told her yeah cancel it. I guess I wasnt expecting an apology and surely there wasnt one. 

I was really speechless. How can a franchiae business be this mismanaged is simply beyound my imagination."}
{"text":"This Pizza Hut is average. However, the delivery is always super fast and friendly. 

So if you're in a pinch and need some food quick and need it delivered I do recommend them. Using the website works really well actually. 

As far as \"Wingstreet\" goes, well those wings are pretty weird. I believe they are actually factory brined because they have this weird salty meat flavor and odd texture throughout. They're not terrible, just not what you want when you want wings."}
{"text":"The most grossly rude and inappropriate staff I have ever been in contact with.  Not a single one of the drivers have managed to find my house, the manager was rude to me then hung up on me.  I will never eat at this pizza hut again."}
{"text":"Not happy with this go around of Pizza hut..
Not sure if they got a new cook .. 
But it taste funny .. 
I ordered Orginal pepperoni ..
It taste sweet and it's thin and the end of it had like some sort of garlic taste to it ..
I didn't ask for all that. 
Hmnnn 
Not a happy camper ..."}
{"text":"Wow they need to retrain their staff on how to speak to adults on the phone. The female had so much lip I hung up on her mid sentence."}
{"text":"I give this place 1 star only because the pizza was still edible and because you wouldn't see my review otherwise. I ordered the two medium deal, along with an order of fries and brownies. I am highly disappointed in the quality and appearance of the pizzas I received today. It seems the cheese on my cheese and pepperoni pizzas migrated to the middle of the pie, leaving both pizzas nearly naked of cheese except at the tips of each slice. Is there no quality check before delivery? Should I have to inspect each item before letting the driver out of my site?My 3 young children were eager to dig in as soon as it arrived, so I couldn't return the pizzas or have the driver come back with replacements, without at least one child having a melt down. As such, they all just had to suck it up and eat what was in front of them, no matter how pitiful its appearance. So sad!!! I only hope that you'll reconsider having food delivered by this location...unless naked pizza is your thing. At the very least, look over your entire order to ensure quality is up to your standards before your delivery driver leaves your door."}
{"text":"So we order wings and pizza, take a few bites of the wings and we find them bloody and raw on the inside.  Hey, mistakes happen - no big deal.  I call them up and they offer a refund/credit to be applied to my next order, and state it will be credited to the account that is my phone number.  
Later I place an order, go in, and even present the email confirmation for the previous order that was undercooked, and the manager makes the brilliant decision not to honor the credit, saying it was too long ago and they have no record of it.
Of course I walk away without wasting any money on the new order that night.  
I would hope the manager had the brains to know no one in their right mind would patronize a restaurant that serves bloody chicken and then flat out lies about crediting money back.  Smart move, Pizza Hut.  I am sure it was worth it for you guys.  Next step for me - hammer them with the survey with corporate."}
{"text":"Well, they blew the order. That may have happened online, but when I called, they promised to send the rest of the order. 90 minutes later, I called to say just forget it and the guy on the phone was smug and chuckled a little. Go over your receipt before the delivery guy leaves.. oh, they charge you $2.95 for delivery."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! So clean and tasty.  Best customer service! Mike is amazing!! And really fast so perfect for our stop during our road trip.  Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"This review is for the delivery/carry out service of pizza hut.  This location is run by experienced management and their kitchen is clean.  Delivery can sometimes take a while since this place services a large area however its good to know that its a competent adult managing this place and not some zit faced high schooler.  The food here is the same as any other pizza hut and they do have wing street and lunch buffet as well."}
{"text":"This location has the worst customer service I have ever experienced. Pizza Hut needs to retrain every single person at this location. You will end up waiting hours for your pizza and when you try and call to check on your order you will be put on hold for over 15-25 min. This place is beyond ridiculous. I'm livid with my 2 experiences with this place."}
{"text":"The staff at this Pizza Hut was very friendly and very efficient. They had my pizza done even earlier than they said and it was actually very very good. It looks wicked take pride in their work at this location. It is very clean and everyone is very personable."}
{"text":"Service was mediocre the last time i went. Waitress was nice, but took a long time to get our food (more of the pizza makers fault, not the waitress). Not the best pizza either. It was alright, but ive had a lot better. 

I've had a better experience at this location, but the last one really kind of hurt my opinion of this Pizza Hut."}
{"text":"The pizza was decent but when I walked in I asked if they have a personal size pizza she said yes but it's very small and showed me the size with her hand. I said what else do you have she said the next size up is a medium I said OK I'll have that. It was $12.99, As I was picking it up another customer walked in and said what specials do you have and she said two medium pizzas each $5.99. I asked the cashier so I could've gotten two pizzas for the same price? She said yes but technically my manager told me not to tell people the specials and less they ask if we have any. So if you were going to get pizza from this location... MAKE SURE TO ASK WHAT THE SPECIALS ARE!"}
{"text":"With so many other pizza options around - and even Pizza Huts, if you prefer this brand - I highly recommend opting for one of those and steering clear of this location.  This was the first time we've ordered pizza from this Pizza Hut, and it will be the last for sure.  

We ordered online and used the 7.99 online only deal, which includes a 2 topping large pizza.  We like different things so we always get our own pizza and then live off left overs for like 3 days, lol.  My husband just wanted double pepperoni.. as in, 2 regular sized toppings worth of pepperoni.  There's no option for that when you order online, and there's no place to leave comments or notes, so I just clicked the \"Extra\" button when I chose the topping, and figured I'd call to clarify what we were ordering.  When I called the local number for the location, I was directed to an automated answering service that gave me some options, to which I chose to \"order or change an order already placed\".. I was on hold for 4 or 5 minutes when I decided to hang up and call again.  Went through the same prompts the second time, only this time I was on hold for over 12 minutes by the time someone finally answered.  The time I was quoted when I ordered my pizza was 10-20 minutes.. so by this time I assumed my pizza had (hopefully) at least been started, but I stayed on hold anyway because at this point I was annoyed and sort of mad.. I was already on my way to pick up my pizza and was about 2 minutes away when I finally spoke to someone.  The man who answered was friendly and apologetic, and assured me that my pizza would be made the way I had hoped.  

So I get to the store and there are 2 people waiting inside in front of me, with 1 person working (that I can see).  We're all three waiting and not being acknowledged at all for the first few minutes, then finally the young guy working turns around and says \"I'll be with you as soon as I'm able\".. and continues working.  Now, this isn't entirely his fault - this is HORRIBLE management.  But I'll leave that there, because I could go on and on about that.  Anyway, he finally is able to get caught up with what he's doing and comes to the counter to wait on all of us.  I'm the last to be served, and when I ask about the pepperoni pizza, he opened the box and showed me.. and it was practically bare!  I told him that didn't even look like EXTRA pepperoni, much less the equivalent of 2 toppings worth.  He was nice, but told me that just because I chose the 7.99 2 topping deal, didn't mean I had to choose 2 toppings (basically saying he had no reason to know that I wanted my 2 toppings to be double pepperoni), to which I explained that I had called and spoken to someone and was assured that it would be understood and made that way.  He offered to add toppings and put it back through the oven, to which I agreed and took a seat while I waited.  By the time I finally left the store, it had been 40 minutes since I ordered, and when I got home with our pizzas, the second pizza we ordered turned out to not even be cooked fully.  The ham was cold and flimsy, and the dough was very soft, pale and sticky.  


Extremely disappointing experience, and one that will definitely opt for a different pizza place next time we order."}
{"text":"So I have 2 very different reviews for this Pizza Hut, and I'm basing my star rating only on our experience with food, because we have never been disappointed with that, and that's really what it's all about.  

So, the food.  First let me say that, I'm pretty sure that if everyone in the area stopped ordering pizza from this location, it wouldnt matter because we are basically keeping them in business.  I mean, we order here a lot..... a lot.. like, at least 2 or 3 times a month.  We're remodeling our home and both working full time, so there are a lot of nights that we forget about dinner until we're both basically starving, and neither of us have the drive to cook or clean, so guess what, pizza it is!  And I'm so not ashamed.  Anyway, we dont always order the same thing, but whatever we order is always good.  We get exactly what we ordered and always in a timely manner.  Our pizza is always  hot and fresh, and when you're reliving your college diet and pizza is your main source of \"nutrition\", that's really appreciated!  So there's that.  (4 stars rather than 5 because, c'mon, it is just pizza).

Now, on to the staff.  I don't want to generalize because I'm sure they're not ALL a bunch of unprofessional, vulgar, ill mannered people, but, the majority of them actually are.  I've had quite a few experiences there with the staff being loud and rude, but my most recent really topped them all, which is what prompted me to finally write this review.  I ordered carry out online, and when I got there, there were 4 or 5 employees standing outside of the door being pretty obnoxious (loud, rude, swearing, etc), but I ignored them and walked by.  From the counter, you have a clear view to the doors and out to the parking lot, and while I was paying, the one girl (I've heard her introduce herself as a supervisor before, not sure if that's true) was facing the building with both middle fingers in the air, yelling \"F*CK this place!\"....... now, I understand that sometimes you have bad days, and there are times when you're just fed up with your job for whatever reason, but, show a little professionalism and respect, and control yourself.  GROW UP.  I can't imagine ever standing outside of my workplace, during operating hours, while there are customers coming and going, and act that way.. I just can't wrap my mind around it."}
{"text":"I was almost done placing my order online. When they suddenly they don't deliver anymore because they are closed. So now they kept my money and I have no food.  I called the location that the website gave me. They say it's not my store. So I call the other location. And they say there are not my store. So now I have to call tomorrow to cancel my order but thy don't even knw what store I belong to. So who do I call to get my money back. No food no money. Good thing domino's pizza is still open. I think that will be my choice of pizza every weekend from now on."}
{"text":"Ordered from here for the first time. I ALWAYS order papa johns but today I decided against that and decided to order pizza hut instead. First off, they told me my order would be here by 430. At 440-445 the driver pulls up, he doesn't even have the correct receipt for me to sign so we had to sign the detailed receipt without a tip or total. I thought that was weird so I figured I'd just call and give a tip over the phone. Well when I opened the box I noticed the pizza didn't even have spinach on it (which I paid extra for.) There was hardly any sauce on it.. it was pretty much just bread. The breadsticks were completely black and burnt, and there wasn't any Marinara sauce that it usually comes with. The wings were completely dry without any sauce. I've never in my life have had to complain about poor quality food so this was my first time. I called and talked to a manager, he explained it was due to new hiring which i understand but i dont get how you could screw up this bad. He could only give me a credit next time I order which is fine although I probably won't ever order from here again. So just beware when you're ordering from here...."}
{"text":"came in at 10:30 waited 10 minutes for someone from the talkative crew in the back to take our order. 
a pissed off manager by the name of Alicia comes to the front insisting they've stopped cooking and I insisted we came in 10 minutes ago but no one was willing to even acknowledge us.... while profanity is heard from the kitchen regarding their teenage angst. 
 honey I've ordered from pizza Hut five minutes before they close,  I'm familiar with the drill. 
after a brief argument which she lost  she was the utmost reluctant to take my order. bad service and rude faces."}
{"text":"Wish I could give zero stars. 

Pizza was late and cold. No discount. And when I called to ask where the pizza was I was hung up on 3 times.  And mobile ad sucks.  

Pizza pizza is cheaper and has better customer service. I just wanted to try stuffed crust :("}
{"text":"If there was an option for zero stars, I would have picked that. Ordered a pizza and breadsticks online.....pick up time said 12:03pm. I arrived just about that time, order was not ready, I was told just a few more minutes. At 12:25pm (22 min after my promised pick up time) I was given a half cooked pizza with about 6lbs of cheese on it. I ordered a pizza with light/easy cheese mind you. The breadsticks (I have a picture) were so nasty looking and when I asked what was that sauce all over the breadsticks I was told it was butter. Well, the breadsticks were so old and cold....the butter didnt melt. Sadie (the manager on duty) showed ZERO compassion or empathy and never offered a solution to the problem.....just asked if I wanted a refund. No offer to remake the order and have it delivered or even apologize. Nothing. Just take it or leave it buddy. 
While I was there, the phone never stopped ringing because nobody working there would answer the phone. A few other people showed up to pick up orders and left without their orders too because they didnt want to wait another 15-20min on top of their promised pick up time.
Its sad that in a town built on the service industry there is very little quality service to be had. This Pizza Hut is no exception. Just stay away."}
{"text":"I've ordered from this location several times, with average results, until tonight. Tonight they delivered a RAW pizza that was stone cold, after an hour and 20 min of waiting. I also received another customer's receipt. So I have some random strangers personal info, and someone else must have mine. I called the store to speak with the manager. The manager screamed at me! Spoke over me! Interrupted me! Said, \"girl please\" and hung up on me. I ended up calling the corporate offices to let them know how I was treated. They were thoroughly embarrassed... As the manager of this branch should be. If you don't know how to treat customers then get a different job!"}
{"text":"Order pizza tonight. Pizza and wings both cold. Ugh I guess this is what I get for ordering at 10pm"}
{"text":"Excellent service! Despite what the other reviews on here say about this place, I had a very positive experience. The employees were very polite. My food was made exactly the way I wanted it and was ready when they said it would be. I just wish the shopping center this place was located in wasn't so run-down."}
{"text":"These guys can really make a good pizza. Great customer service. It shows that sometimes its about the people that work there. Definitely Coming back."}
{"text":"Still sadly disappointed in this location, I've never been so let down. I even spoke to Donna the manager and my stuffed crust pizza still came out a limp soggy mess. I know for a fact it isn't supposed to be this way! I've ordered from this location three times and my pizza has always come out soggy. I've posted a picture if you're not convinced. I'd rather drive a few miles to pick up my pizza from the Broadway and McClintock location than have a soggy pizza that I can't even pick up with my hands."}
{"text":"Not that good when it comes to their service. I always complain about their service when I am here. The service on this place really sucks.

Food was undoubtedly good, love the pepperoni pizza."}
{"text":"These people don't even deserve 1 star because they are so unprofessional. I've never been so dissapointed in my life."}
{"text":"If I could do zero stars I would. We ordered a couple pizzas and wings and when we got there it said on the board that out pizza would be ready at 9:05 and we got there at 9:07 after about 30 minutes our pizza still wasn't ready. When we asked they said they didn't have the ingredients to make it and that we could either get a refund or wait and make the pizza when different ingredients. Fucking unbelievable."}
{"text":"I wish I could give a zero rating. I was treating my team to pizza for lunch today and ordered $150 worth of pizza. We ordered on-line for delivery. Timing was critical as part of our group had to be back in court for a trial. We waited and waited, but the group from court went to eat somewhere else because they were tight for time. The pizza arrived 40 minutes late. The driver said the manager would call me back and adjust my bill. When I called them, I couldn't get through. I finally got through and they hung up on me. Not only was the service bad, the pizza was no where near what I remember from Pizza Hut, skimpy toppings, very little sauce and not much flavor. DO NOT patronize this place. Many better local places. I made a mistake. Everybody does pizza better than Pizza Hut!"}
{"text":"I came her after work to get pizza for the family for dinner. I called ahead @ 5:45 to place my order for just 2 large pizzas to be ready at 6:15. I'm there at 6:05 and its not even close to being ready. 

I don't know what the policy is, but I should be compensated some type of way. The wait time was crazy. Plus there was at least 3 cars behind me waiting for their orders. 

The mgr., Lance, finally gave a portion of my bill back to me after I insisted something needed to be done. 

My slowest experience at Pizza Hut ever. Next time I may be going to the Dominos less than 5 min. away. 

Only positive is they have a drive thru."}
{"text":"I order from here all the time, and for the most part my order is always correct and tasteful. But this time I experienced bad customer service. I ordered and PAYED for extra cheese. So you can imagine my surprise when I receive the pizza and see that there is little too no cheese on it. I called to complain and the girl over the phone said they put extra cheese on it and I told her if she wanted me to send her a picture or bring it back to show her how little cheese there was. She replied with a smug attitude about it and said too bring it back. I did not appreciate the attitude whats so ever. It would be an inconvenience for me to go back and show her. All I wanted was a credit on my account but instead I was treated rudely."}
{"text":"There seems to be a lot of bad reviews on here, and I'm not sure why honestly...

Service-- so I ordered carry out because I'm not lazy. I followed the timer and got there a minute after it went off. Pizza was waiting for me hot and fresh. The staff was friendly and quick, can't argue over that.

Food-- it was stuffed crust pizza, do I need to explain more?!? It was pretty good, little on the greasy side, but I don't mind it one bit.

Overall--- not sure why so many people are hating on Pizza Hut lately. I loved it and will go back."}
{"text":"Pizza Hut, Bartley Bull Parkway. Never had theirs before. We did the 5 bucks, 5 bucks... special. Ordered a large Triple Crown with a Homestyle crust (almost 23 bucks before tax. For that alone) & 3 med. Each with 3 toppings. The triple crown had a super THIN crust (the box it came it was thicker, no joking). This apparently was Homestyle. I'd HATE to have ordered a thin crust! OMG! Each of the $5 mediums had more toppings than the large (again, no joke) with at least a proper crust. Disappointed. With all kidding aside, buy a frozen pizza & stick it in the oven you'll get more toppings. Will take about the same time. Taste was Ok\". Won't go back. Regret not getting a party pizza somewhere else (with wings) & saving a few bucks."}
{"text":"2 hours for delivery, ice cold when it got here and smashed to one side of the box. $30? I'll just order from dominos or papa John's"}
{"text":"We order from this place often and find it to be a typical Pizza Hut.  We always get the triple box to feed a family of four and have leftovers for lunch for $50 (we add salad and drinks and fries often as well) so price not bad for amount and quality of food.  Tastes great, delivery fast (30-45 min on a Friday night), service quick (we order online) and delivery driver always friendly and leaves with a nice tip.  It's our go to for a lazy night."}
{"text":"We ordered pizza and wings and two pepsi at 515 pm....said it would be delivered by 545..at 610 i call and they say my order out the door next. 15 minutes more...it arrives minus one pop and i showed the driver it should have been two..he said he would bring one and he never showed up. Pizza was cold but the wings were fine.we will not be ordering from this store again."}
{"text":"I've always liked the crust overall. But I ordered the Buffalo pizza (comes with buffalo sauce). I've tried this kind of pizza at 2 other places and it was about 7x better. The buffalo sauce tasted more like a tangy syrup or something similar of. I hate to say it, but I wont be back to Pizza Hut for quite a while. Threw my appetite off!  

Best case: Don't try their buffalo pizza."}
{"text":"Horrible service I do not recommend.  Only get one star because they force you to give them one"}
{"text":"You guys seriously moved to this place from the old one that was less than 5 minutes away from my house?  Seriously?  What happened, did you replace the good pizza pie makers as well?  It's on the same street!  The pizza should stay the same!  Horrible.  Horrible!

On a Friday night, at least once a month the family & I stay home and order a pizza and watch movies.  Save some money, watch some flicks you know?  But being that the Pizza Hut that was nearest our home now moved to way WAY up the street near the 215 freeway, I now have to drive nearly 20 minutes each way to get my fix.  I wouldn't mind it if Pizza Hut kept the same consistency to their pies!  You're a chain, they should stay the SAME!

So I ordered online, and I will admit that I'm a P.I.T.A when I order because when Pizza Hut runs their special of a medium pizza for $6.99 each with unlimited toppings I go nuts.  There are three of us in the house, and each of us has different tastes.  So what do I do?  Improvise with toppings on each 1/2 of the pizza!  You figure if it's offered online then it really shouldn't be a big deal.  So for each 1/2 we all get what we want.  I've done this multiple times and our old Pizza Hut didn't skip a beat.  Nor was my pizza ever made that bad.

With the order online in, we all take that long drive up the hill of Cheyenne Ave. to find this new fandangled Pizza Hut.  Turns out it's in the same shopping center as the Neighborhood Walmart.  We get there and park, and whaddaya you know it's busy!  Friday night!  Just got paid!  And here we all are, probably near broke, eating Pizza Hut.  I'm OK with this, as long as the pizza is tasty!

Unfortunately our first round of pizzas was not.  There were some missing toppings from one of our pizzas, and the other one had the incorrect crust!  Not to mention, the crusts were looking way flat, like they didn't have enough time to proof.  I was not taking those home, so the manager came by and told me he could make me two new pies but it would take at least 20 minutes since they are backed up.  I agreed and waited.  And waited.  Finally after nearly 30 minutes I stood up and asked the gal behind the counter if my reorder was done yet.  It had been sitting in the warmer!  Couldn't someone have called me back up right when they were done?  Geez.

Took a look at this round of pizzas and the crusts still looked flat.  I did not order thin crust folks!  Then on one of my pizzas they forgot the crust seasonings as well as my balsamic sauce 'drizzle'.  They managed to fix this but rather sloppily.  Then on my other pizza, the crust did not look like a pretzel at all!  It should be darker brown along the crust with the sea salt sprinkled on top!  This was some weak @$$ pretzel crust I'm telling you.  But I didn't want to wait AGAIN for another set of pies so we left to trek back home.

At least this time with the pizzas the toppings weren't as scarce, they shouldn't have been because I ordered like 5 toppings for each 1/2!  But man these guys need a lesson in placing spinach on a pizza.  Can you guys please, please make it look a bit more presentable?  Looks like it was thrown on there from a Bryce Harper lob at midfield.  Too much power!  Not enough finesse.

Pizzas were OK, not what we usually enjoy with our movie night at home.  And it all ended with the CRUST.  Toppings were good, fairly fresh, and the cheese wasn't lacking.  It was the horrendous crust holding it all together.  It was too thin, and in some parts underbaked!  Ugh!  It had less crisp crunch and too much chew.  You could say it was because of the toppings, but I've ordered lots of toppings on our pizzas from our old Pizza Hut before and they never came back with uncooked crusts.  It's the DOUGH.  Wasn't pulled from the freezer long enough and set to proof so it could rise like it's supposed to before baking.  I know because I used to work for a Pizza Hut express back in college and had to proof crusts daily.  I'm going to venture and guess they didn't make enough crusts for the day because they weren't expecting that big of a crowd.  So some of the crusts they pulled out at the last minute didn't thaw enough (yes Pizza Hut uses frozen dough).  But come on, it's a Friday night!  Stoners & poor people alike will want to be ordering pizza!

Sorry guys, your new location is killin' me.  Won't be back there for a while until you settle in.  I'm gonna go with my other pizza place that's less than 5 minutes away...DOMINO'S.

Get it together folks!"}
{"text":"My personal experience with this location last time. Phone wait time 20 minutes. Where I was told your order should be ready within 20-25 minutes,
Arrived at the store to pick up my order after 20 min where on the order status is written my order was ready 4 minutes prior my arrival (awesome right) yeah you would think so,
Cashier- sir I do apologize for the inconvenience and for the wait time if you would like I can give you a free soda with your order.  Your order is not ready yet, it should be ready in about 15 to 20 min, well I guess I'll wait right. Total wait time amount 65 minutes. Cashier goes back and get my order ready without even washing her hands , are you serious!!
Then accidentally she drops something on the floor and without hesitation she grabs it and grabs my pizza with it. This is just ridiculous, 
When I asked her if she washed her hands and regarding dirty dish she denied it.
Places like this need to be shut down and not serve to public, I had other experiences with other location pizza hot but nothing like this.  Also cleanliness is disgusting, food all over the floor, see pics"}
{"text":"I've given this Pizza Hut several chances but they're just terrible. Super long delivery times, soggy uncooked pizza, and they never pick up the store phone. I'm never ordering from this location again."}
{"text":"About once a week, the husband convinces me that we need pizza.  Ideally, we would get a real one made by people and not a chain.  But, this is often motivated by laziness and downtown Phoenix is the black hole of good pizza.  We would have to drive somewhere to get a good pie, and we're just not having that.

I have a confession to make.  Even though I'm from Buffalo, NY, a city with as many pizza joints as Phoenix has Circle K's, I like Pizza Hut.  It was always the excursion for us growing up.  Sure, we could get a $5 large delivered from the place down the street, but Pizza Hut was an evening out.  A restaurant for pizza, complete with the low-hung light fixtures and the red plastic glasses, it was a special occasion.  And although their pizza was nothing like normal pizza, I developed a special fondness in my tummy for the pan pizza.

And, I'm about to write a review for Domino's as a comparison to this debacle.

We ordered online + 1 star. The website said that it would take 90 minutes - 1 star.

They have blue cheese + 1 star.  The restaurant called to say that they no longer carry blue cheese - 1 star.

We ordered wings that were actually pretty spicy +1 star. They were breaded and had something sweet and sticky on it - 1 star.

The marinara sauce was watered down - 1 star

The delivery guy got lost, forgot the credit card slip and forgot the soda we ordered.  Then he had the nerve to ask me if we still wanted it.  Then he said it would take him an HOUR to return with the pop. -1 stars.

The order was delivered in less than the estimated 90 minutes (minus the pop), he did come back to deliver the 2 liter in less than 30 minutes, and the food was as mediocre as I expected it to be. + 2 stars

I would give a zero if I had to leave the house for this kind of service, but since dinner was delivered they earn 1 star."}
{"text":"Horrible experience! Took 1-1/2 hours to deliver a pizza and a couple other basic items. Really? And you charge extra for that? And it was cold and didn't even taste very good. Not like the Pizza Hut I remember. I tried pick up a few months ago at another location and had a similar bad experience. I guess this location is kind of new because they deliver to my house. Well if you are willing to wait 90 minutes for a pizza that is. On top of that when I called after 45 minutes to give them my gate code I asked for an update when it would go out and the guy was rude and wouldn't give me an update. He basically said that they are backed up and I'll get it when I get it.  It was 3:00 in the afternoon, not even a normal rush time. When I placed the order online the estimated delivery time was about an hour, which was long but I decided I could wait an hour but they didn't come close to meeting that estimate. . Had I known it was really going to be 90 minutes I wouldn't have gone through with the order. 

Going back to Dominos. They are always fast and the food is actually really good these days. Not your Daddy's Dominos."}
{"text":"The worst Pizza Hut I have ever had.  Delivery consistently takes forever.  I understand they have a large service area, but if it takes too long, it is just not worth it.  The quality of the pizza here is also very poor compared to other Pizza Huts.  I would say avoid this one."}
{"text":"Not sure what happened to this place but the employees are not friendly, you are not greeted with a smile but treated like your an inconvenience.  The food is awful, pizza always taste like the cardboard it came in and the breadsticks usually taste like a cinnastick....This place needs to remember that we have a lot more options today than we used to and if you really want pizza hut, run to target and get a personal pan...always taste the way it should."}
{"text":"I live nearby and probably order from here at least two or three times a month. I usually pick up my order and order online. I have never had a negative experience and have actually had great customer service every time. Maybe they have made some changes as I see others have not had as much luck. Either that or we reap what we sew I suppose..."}
{"text":"I've ordered the personal pizza and wait for 15 min' for the order, paid extra for the pizza souse on the side. When the pizza was ready i find out that this is a \"baby size\" pizza. Very tiny pizza. All of the pizza was fill with oil and it was not a nice taste. Overall it was A decent time of waiting but the pizza was awful. I can't say that I'm going to order again but i hope things will get better over there."}
{"text":"Just order elsewhere. 

Ordered a pan pizza online( says it on receipt),  what arrived was thin crust.

Tried to catch the delivery lady on her way out the door. By the time I went to grab the phone and give them a call my family had already started away at the (1) Pepperoni Pizza. 

Notified the store, I was interrogated first 48 style by 3 different employees. Was told I couldnt get a refund and would have to send back what was left of the pizza. A picture wont suffice? NO! they want it back to show the cooks that they defrosted the wrong crust...

Okaaaaaaay."}
{"text":"I was glad to see a Pizza Hut open up right next door to me. Unfortunately, my first (and what will be my only) experience with them was terrible. It took an hour and a half to get the basic pizza I ordered at noon, which is double the time I was quoted and it was cold when it arrived. I literally live RIGHT NEXT DOOR. So disappointing. The driver was extremely brusque and this is certainly not an experience I wish to repeat. I'll be taking my business elsewhere for sure."}
{"text":"Worst Pizza Hut ever!!! I've been waiting for my pizza for almost an hour after the guy said it would only take 15-20 minutes. There was a family here that had ordered delivery and waited for over an hour and their order never got delivered so the decided to come pick it up themselves. Got a cold pizza so they complained and it took turn about 40 minutes to remake the order. The cashier disappeared for a while so we all decided to call the place to get guy's attention and nobody answered. Wow!!!"}
{"text":"Rude rude rude. I get pizza once a week from Pizza Hut. The last two times they screwed up and didn't get my order to me and I had to call. The manager Stephanie was very rude and treated me like trash. I did contact customer service and file a complaint."}
{"text":"Ordered pepperoni pizza and brownies. So good. Perfect pizza. Nice and hot. Brownies were amazing. I hope my next experience is just as good."}
{"text":"It's so funny that they have zero customers and are able to keep track when people park there for ten minutes to tow them. How about worrying about your fucking food than towing families who just needed to grab their kid and leave. Your an absolute joke and I hope your business fails. Trash."}
{"text":"The service I got here this evening was exceptional! It was very nice, pizza was done right on time, I was in and out of there."}
{"text":"Pretty sure this was my worst experience at restaurant ordered food over phone at 9:17 PM and was quoted 10-20 minutes...arrived at 9:50PM they had no order for me to make matters worse when I assured them I ordered at this location showed cashier my call log redialed to double check while in restaurant they offered me $5 off but I tried to explain to them I couldn't wait 20-30 minutes for my new quote time my wife was waiting on food to go to work had to quickly go to rascal house and ask them for a pizza as quickly as they could they quoted me 10 minutes it was done in 9 so I won't be returning this Pizza Hut anytime soon and will encourage my neighbors not to go there either luckily my wife stayed in car in driveway I gave her the food now I'm still hungry I never do these type of rants since I work in a restaurant and I'm very understanding of situations but the manager told me there is no corporate number so until I find one this is the best I could do"}
{"text":"Rude! Rude! Rude! I was placing an order online and selected a coupon, but it disappeared when I signed in, so I called. I tell the woman who answered the phone what happened and she asks me to hold, which is no problem. After a short time, a man gets on and asks for my address, which I give, and I'm back on hold again without being informed. Finally, a man picks up, possibly the same one, possibly not, who tells me that they don't deliver to any addresses with four digits in them?! He then asks me what my cross streets are. Since they've delivered to me before, I ask when this changed. Instead of answering my question, he asks me again what my cross streets are. I finally told him that I knew where my other Pizza Hut is, which I did. I gave them a call and got the order placed with no issue and the correct pricing."}
{"text":"This is by far the worst Pizza Hut in town. It is a shame I always give this location another chance after many let's downs (ex: uncooked pizza, stale chicken wings, and cold cheese sticks), but after tonight I will for certainly never come back.

I call to make a carry out order, but after a ten minute wait I hang up and call again only to be on hold for another fifteen minutes. That's when I decided to go to the location only to see and find out that they weren't busy at all. I'm greeted by a woman in the back then she comes to take my order and once I give her my credit card/ID she says she needs to see a valid ID...I thought she was kidding when I just showed her my Nevada state ID, but she wasn't. I just walked out and didn't even bother arguing with her, because there really was no point."}
{"text":"As I waitied over 15mins for a personal pan pizza as a walk in, I saw the cashier handle cash, cards, and the register then would go in the back and help make pizza without washing his hands!!!! And 3 more employees who were working did the same. So disgusting"}
{"text":"After a long day of emotional pain and getting in touch with our inner feelings did not at all feel like cooking at all. The search for something fast, delicious, and inexpensive were details in searching for the perfect answer to our meal decisions. The answer was simple pizza the cure all to our dilemma. Deciding on Pizza Hut was simple too. 

Delivery was a must since already home and comfortable for the evening. Ordered from the Pizza Hut app which was quick and easy. The prices were inexpensive and was able to combine two different offers when placed the order in the app. 

The order was delivered within such a short amount of time it seemed like they waved a wand and the pizza was here by fairy deliver. The order was correct and still hot when I enjoyed the first piece from the box. I ordered the special 2 topping 2 medium size pizzas with regular crust for $5.99 each. One of those medium pizza had pepperoni and bacon, the other was sausage and pepperoni. The app offered a large 2 topping pizza for $7.99 which I upgraded the crust to stuffed for $2; with sausage and pineapple for the toppings. 

The delivery driver was very pleasant and took the time to ask how our evening was. He verified the card and asked what the last four were of the card we used. With driver was old school too and even verified the signature asking for the card to reconfirm all the information we gave him. In today's day of heightened security was glad to see that the drivers care enough about the customers security and reliability of their customers."}
{"text":"After eating a nice healthy dinner salad with blueberries it just did not fill me up. I wanted to be good and said life is too short not to go to bed fulfilling the simplest of desires. The twins said they would no issues sharing pizza with me either! I ordered delivery via the app on my phone. Delivery was a must and after ordering the pizza my phone even gets updates making sure the order was received, and when it's out for delivery. 

The Pizza Hut app is extremely simple to order from, plus they offer a rewards program here that rewards the customer for buying pizza. Their rewards program adds up dollar amounts that can be used towards free pizzas starting with mediums and the point values go up from there. I believe that it is worth it, and I am getting close to a medium in points.

I ordered a Large Stuffed Crust pizza with sausage and bacon. At $9.99 that is not a bad deal, this price includes the up charge for the stuffed crust. I also took advantage of the 2 medium 2 topping pizza for $5.99 a piece. Both mediums toppings were the same mushroom and sausage. The cheese bread sounded so good too! So we had this too! 

The pizza was delivered within 20 minutes of when they received the order. Their pizza ovens at the store must make those pizzas instantly: it seems. The pizza was hot and fresh when I took it too the kitchen and checked it. The pizza tasted so good and really hit the spot. We sat and ate our pizza in front of the tele and with delicious delivery!"}
{"text":"They left our breadsticks and refused to send anyone up to deliver them. Do not order from them."}
{"text":"It smelled bad. Really bad! Like old dirty socks. But service was pleasant and the food was even better! Easy cheese, well done, xtra sauce thin perfection! Timed for 20mins or so due to the well done request but the pizzas were fresh & hot. I would go back to this location. Only thing it's take out only people."}
{"text":"I understand that this isn't a fine dining restaurant but the female cook that brought out our food was extremely rude, she practically threw it on to the table along with the plates. For this reason I will not be returning and they need to work on their customer service."}
{"text":"THIS PLACE IS TERRIBLE!
I placed an order over the phone and my husband went out of his way to pick it up on to find they'd LOST THE ORDER.  Customer service was terrible.  the restaurant was very noisy....lots of yelling back and forth from the front of the store to the kitchen.  couldn't imagine actually eating in the place.  If you're in the Brunswick, OH area and want pizza, DON'T GO HERE."}
{"text":"Pizza was ordered at 4:17.. currently 5:04. still no pizza. PS im picking up and been here since 4:30 on the positive side was given in-store credit so thank you Management! Really good for making it up!(:"}

{"text":"Don't order from here. Gina who says she is the manager which I don't believe because this would have been handled more correctly just told me I can't get a refund after they bought me a undone pizza last night and again this morning. I asked her if u can get a refund and give them the pizza back she said no. What I never been to a pizza hut so inconsiderate they always remake it no matter how many times till they get it right it's not like I ate the pizza I still have it I'm gonna get my money back one way or the other happy I paid with a credit card and I can charge it back and I can't wait to talk to corporate tommorow and report this fake general manager"}
{"text":"I am not normally one to order food online, but I did for the first time a few weeks ago. To my surprise, it said that delivery would be 25 minutes and gave me an exact time for delivery. Order arrived somewhere around 20-22 minutes. Yeah! I then received a coupon via email for $10 off my next order of $20 or more. It was good for 30 days. I decided to use it today and ordered online again. All went smoothly and again my order arrived a few minutes before the scheduled delivery time. 

My only complaint is that I couldn't use the $10 off promo code with any specials, such as their $6.99 for any medium pizza deal. Also, there is a $3 delivery fee that I did not notice the first time, which is not to say I wasn't charged. Meh."}
{"text":"Took 55 minutes for delivery on an average thursday. On top of that I ordered 24 dollars in pizza was going to give the guy a 6 dollar tip but he didn't even have 20$ I'm change! Un acceptable service... if you know ahead it's a cash order... What's the excuse. Won't be ordering from here again."}
{"text":"If I could give zero stars, I would. A delivery time of 4 hours? I don't understand what the issue is with this location. Also, I shouldn't have to call back 3 times after being put on hold and hung up on to cancel an order. Do not ever order from here."}
{"text":"This Pizza Hut is the absolute worst!!!! I have had an issue with them every single time I have ordered from them and the ONLY reason I am a return customer is because it is the only pizza place that delivers to my address. The delivery drivers are always a minimum of an hour late after the estimated delivery time. The staff that answer the phones are horrifically unprofessional and are completely rude.

Three deliveries ago I wanted over two hours for my order. When I called to check on my food I was informed that the delivery driver wouldn't be able to get to me for an additional hour and a half and by that time they would be closed. After explaining that not only was I upset about the long wait time but also that no one called to let me know I would never receive my order I decided to drive there for pick up. After a total of almost a 3 hour wait time,  I arrived to speak to the \"manager\" on duty, who spoke with the intelligence equivalent to a 5th grader. The gentlemen had zero sympathy for the poor service I received and expected me to pay for my pizza! 

Two deliveries ago I ordered a pizza with the bacon stuffed crust. When my order arrived, again extremely late, it was traditional crust. When I called to inform them they had sent the opposite of what I had order their excuse was they didn't have the stuffed crust I had wanted. Instead of calling me and apologizing for the inconvenience and asking me what I wanted in place of the bacon stuffed crust they decided to send me whatever they wanted. 

My most recent order, placed tonight was over an hour late. When I called to check on the status of my delivery I remained on hold for extended amount of time just to end up speaking to a women who was completely rude, and made it sound like I was the ridiculous one for calling them to find out when someone would finally arrive with my dinner. 

In conclusion, I am absolutely disgusted with this Pizza Hut location. I am utterly surprised they have stayed in business this long. SHAME on this business for continuing to allowed the people of this neighborhood to receive absurd wait times, verbal abuse on the phone lines, and most importantly extremely poor service."}
{"text":"Wow....Staying at hotel less than 3 miles away and called for a pizza. After several attempts of finding the address in their system, I gave the address three times, I was transferred to another location across town that does not deliver here so I just gave up on this place....SMH"}
{"text":"Like a reviewer said. This place is a blast from the past!!!! It's a bit worn down and tab bit dirty. But, reminds me of the 80's  Their pizza is Pizza Hut quality and wait staff is good to go.  Recommended!"}
{"text":"We have tried this location twice and I'm sorry to the workers that care but this location royally sucks!!!! The first time pizza was undercooked and pretty cold now this time the pizza was room temp. they forgot the chicken wings and it was 30-40 minutes later then they said now I can understand the problem with the delay of time because of the construction on Eastern and the time we ordered at (5:00 rush hour). They did replace the chicken wings (that were forgotten) by delivery but guess what they got here in 20 minutes piping hot. Why can you get me something you forgot in record time but cannot get me food to my door when you say! The things that make you say hmmmm! Anyway my family and I will go back to supporting the mom and pop pizza joints around here that care about people! Support your small businesses Las Vegas forget about these corporate people that don't give a crap about any of us!!!!"}
{"text":"We were delivered the completely wrong pizza. I only noticed it was the wrong pizza after I flipped it over. Yes. I had to flip the pizza over to see what it was because it got folded over during delivery.  I called the store and they offered to remake and redeliver the pizza, in 35 minutes. I'm not sure what happened or why they didn't just call delivery guy and tell him to deliver my actual pizza.

Update: 
New pizza delivered. Absolutely no sauce, and no crust flavoring. Called for a refund  and the manager wanted me to GO TO THE STORE to pick up a refund. No, thanks."}
{"text":"I've never had such a bad experience at a pizza establishment. Especially formerly working for a pizzeria myself, I am familiar with the goingson and the way the \"manager\" decided to treat us was totally inappropriate and rude. We ordered our pizza approximately around 9 pm, got our pizza about 25 minutes late without our dipping sauces and pop. To preface we have ordered 3 times before and EVERYTIME they have forgotten our dipping sauces. 30 minutes later no dipping sauces, called again and the driver is not even on his way. The manager gets on the phone and is LAUGHING at me. Telling everyone \"what do I want?\" I clearly told him what they should've done is taken someone that is in the store that's a driver to send the dips instead of waiting for the driver to come back (that's what they told me they were doing for 30 minutes). Manager still proceeds to laugh and say I'm threatening him when I'm saying they need to do something because this is ridiculous. Keeps saying well what do you want. When I say fine a large cheese pizza he says \"I've never heard of that before but fine\" I've never been more disgusted with my experience."}
{"text":"This pizza hut has the absolute BEST STAFF! Everytime I go to pickup an order I get someone new that has a smile from ear to ear and is very helpful and friendly. Pizza is always great too! For me my experience on a place starts when I pick up my order, give good customer service and I'll be happy :)"}
{"text":"Cheap price but pretty whimsy  pizza.  Hardly any toppings The staff was really nice but I just don't understand why they were so skimpy on the toppings"}
{"text":"Every time I try to order a pizza from there they tell me that there will be a 2-3 hour wait. Rally? It's pizza, if you can't do it right just give up at life. 
Not only that, when I ask to speak with a manager they have hung up on me as when I call back and identify myself they put me on hold for 20 minutes until I just hung up. Their customer service is the worst and I can't in good faith ever order from there again. 
My suggestion is to go to Hungry Howie's right down the street. Their very close and all round better, both service and quality.  
 This is the Worst Pizza Hut in the nation!!!"}
{"text":"Tried pizza hut again today. This time I decided to try ordering in the store. I got there and the first thing I heard was a girl yelling at a co-worker that she would not go to the front to work and take orders. Another few minutes passed before anyone came to the front or even acknowledged me. Came back to pick up the order a phone was ringing not being picked up, a worker passed me and another person and did not acknowledge either of us. Very bad customer service....food is OK though"}
{"text":"Order delivery over the phone, was given an estimated delivery time of 30 mins. Been waiting 1.5 hours, and still no pizza. Guess it's karma for ordering from a place that has one star as it's rating

Oh update - now they \"lost\" the order and can't find it, and refund the money becaUse they can't find it. Yet there is a charge to the credit card. Shut this place down."}
{"text":"Well now I know not to ever order a spinach pizza from here ever again ... Next time I'll go to the grocery story & buy a frozen pizza & a bag of spinach & just throw the spinach on top .... Or stick with dominos where they actually cook the spinach in / with the pizza. On top of that .. The pizza is dry !!! I'm upset because I was really craving this."}
{"text":"We must be a glutton for punishment.  We decided to give them another try on 3/21/14.  Once again both pizzas came without wax paper.  They were so greasy they had soaked through the box!  The Meatlovers had barely any toppings.  It used to come loaded up similar to the picture online.  Several slices didn't even have toppings.  We also ordered double sauce yet it had barely any sauce on it.  The other pizza we ordered, the Cheeselovers wasn't bad although it had soaked through the box also.  Never again."}
{"text":"I first tried ordering online but after several attempts I realize they were having system issues, I decided to call. I get a pretty helpful cs by the name of Jade. She was very patient with me. I was made to feel she understood what I was asking for as I repeated several time what I was looking for. Now I don't order front Pizza Hut often and can say today will be my last! 
The young lady Alya delivering was kind but I know well enough better to check my food. Before I can do that she asked to see my card that was used for the order. I grab it and she tells me \"sorry, this isn't the same card used\" I come back with well is this even the right order. She has a puzzled look on her face and says \"you know what, your right...I have the wrong card receipt but your order should be correct\" Before she walks away I asked to see my pizza and guess what...they are made wrong! Alya leaves with one of the pizza's. I decide to call them as I notice the crust is wrong on the pizza. Jordan who reports he's the manager comes onto the line lacking empathy and apparently is not full trained in all areas of his job as he did Not know how to refund my money. I have a new pizza but terribly afraid to eat it. 
Alya returns back with the correct receipt and the correct pizza. Thanks but no thanks. I'll reach out to upper seasoned management on Monday! 
I am so done with Pizza Hut!

Update: I call and speak with Ashley who reports she is a manager. I inform her of the incident and my interactions with her staff. She went to complete radio silence! I asked if there was a plan in place as I was not the only customer who had issues with this location on Saturday night. She came back with a generic response which is fine. I asked for corporates info and she claims it gets kicked back to her! She offers to leave my name and number for her boss which I believe she reports he's a district manager. I do let Ashley know I'll be requesting a refund and she offers to take care of that. She checks her Saturday receipts and tells me \"your card was declined so you were Not charged for your purchase\" Ashley please don't insult my intelligence, if my card was declined Pizza Hut would have NEVER made the delivery! So yes please and thank you...have your manager call me!"}
{"text":"Giving it two stars now. My last three orders have all been a failure. Ordered bacon cheese stuffed crust, each slice of pizza were literally 3-5 bites, so yes, the pizza slices were incredibly small and the crust was way too much. 2nd complaint. Ordered pasta, took nearly an hour, for ONE pasta. Week later, ordered another, same exact situation, except they didn't bring me my entire order. Really disappointed. They can do better. They have done better. They need to get it together."}
{"text":"Your review helps others learn about great local businesses.

Please don't review this business if you received a freebie for writing this review, or if you're connected in any way to the owner or employees. I have been ordering here for years. Since it opened. Let's face it, these are young adults with a manager. I am very happy with the pizza and the service I recently ordered pizza and they forgot my soda. He ran right back and got it. A++++ from me to you"}
{"text":"I happened across this location while passing through  the area and although the 2.5 star rating was somewhat offputting I was craving a greasy pizza...I'm happy to say that it did not disappoint. The location is decent but parking is a bit tight. Based on the small seating area, I imagine this is more of a takeout/delivery place.  
Unfortunately I had to pee and was met with a \"there are no public washrooms here\" line ... which, if you're a restaurant that has a dine-in option is a little strange...now, not only was I hangry, I was also growing a urine baby...bad combination. 

The service - nothing to write home about - I wasn't met with a smile or a scowl..but a neutral face.

Overall, if I'm in the area again, craving a greasy pizza and have an empty bladder, I'll stop by.

2.5 stars is accurate, but I'll round up to a 3 because I'm feeling generous."}
{"text":"We don't order delivery from the Carrick location anymore, we drive out to Brentwood when we want Pizza Hut.  Yes it's inconvenient, but it's better then taking your chances with what you'll get from this filthy, unorganized, slow location. 

Since the health department hasn't gotten around to shutting them down yet may I suggest calling your doctor to make sure your current on all your shots before you bite in. That is if you can get sold of anyone to place an order in the first place. 

Years from now we are going to learn on the news that the reason why they never took orders was because they only delivered to their friends who called them on their cellphones.  When they dropped off the pizzas we are going to find out they were dropping off drugs! At least this scenario makes sense."}
{"text":"No complaints here! Did not have to wait long to order on the phone [even for a Friday night!] and customer service was efficient. The only downside to the ordering process was the mobile app [in Safari on the iPhone, no-I did not download the app-I got flustered] did not allow me to change the location for pickup, it only had a preset location [near my office, not my house] from a previous order. Moving on....the food was great, I mean Pizza Hut is Pizza Hut, so you can pretty much anticipate the end product. The one thing everyone raved about was the boneless chicken wings, they were good even being plain [kind of upset they cost as much as they do and still do not include ANY dipping sauces]! BUT definitely will return."}
{"text":"The service at this Pizza Hut is horrible.  I live two blocks away, spelled the name of my street several times and they said I was out of their delivery area and she didn't even know where I lived. The Manager has no comprehension of customer service. Their online ordering has more glitches than a new Windows launch.  Eighteen dollars, it wasn't worth eighteen cents.  The pizza dough was old, so it was soggy and when I asked Zach, the manager of it was old, he said yes, two days old. I thought pan dough was fresh made every day.  Well, so if you like pizza, don't get it from here."}
{"text":"This place is horrible donot order from here worst Pizza Hut ever. I ordered some wings and they can 1:30 later and I love literally 5 min away. I know it does. It take 1:30 hours to bring me some wings nor does take that long to make. Another great surprise was that the delivery boy came here with an attitude when I questioned him why did it take so long. Then he gave me the are you serious face and straight up said no it's not late we made it within the quoted time I dono what your talking about. 
First of all who the F**k are you talking to me like that and second of all you are lucky I didn't smash those wings in your face! Better check your people who work at this location comping at people's houses like that with an attitude. Again worst place to order anything from. Pizza Hut should really do something about the people that work at this location because honestly little Caesars would of been a better place to go!"}
{"text":"I think the deals Pizza Hut has is the best value for the buck of all the chain pizza places.   I often order from this location and as far as getting orders correct and them tasting as expected, they do a great job. Where they suck is getting the pizza ready when they say they will. They are typically nearly double the time they email you it will be ready for pick up.  

Ratings are based on value for what you're charged and thus three stars"}
{"text":"An anomaly occurred last night at about 8pm.  My wife said \"let's get some wings, does Pizza Hut have good wings?\".  

You need to understand that this is an incredibly rare thing.   So rare that I'm not sure it's ever happened before.   And it may never happen again.     

Pizza Hut / Wingstop does indeed have tasty wings available for delivery.  I jumped into the Pizza Hut app on my iPhone, ordered 24 wings in a trio of flavors (8 Cajun Dry Rub Boneless, 8 Lemon Pepper Dry Rub Bone-in, 8 Honey BBQ Bone-in).   They were delivered in about 25 minutes, were freshly prepared and hot, and we feasted away.  While all 3 flavors were great, we both agreed the Cajun Dry Rub Boneless was the best of the 3.  

I think the Pizza Hut app deserves some attention as well.  They've done a great job of making it easy to order.  Don't bother calling an order in.  Get the app, set up an account, and it really becomes a breeze.   One thing I really, really like about the app is that it tells you what the estimated delivery time is going to be BEFORE you even begin placing your order.  So, if you fire up the app and the estimate is 2 hours, you can look into another option for your meal before you blow your money.   

As pizza (and wing) delivery places go, Pizza Hut (and this location) are leading the pack."}
{"text":"I have not ordered Pizza Hut in a long time.  When it's busy it can take up to two hours to get some food delivered.  I decided to give this place another try and order for lunch hoping it wouldn't be as busy.  I was actually impressed.  The food came when it was supposed to arrive.  I did not get a single call from a delivery person crying to me about being lost either.  Get this, the food was actually hot enough to burn my tounge, just how I like it.  I never expect my delivery food to be hot, no matter where it comes from.  This may not be the place for dinner because it is just so damned busy, but lunch, not so bad.

Update.  This must have been a fluke because I ordered again for lunch thinking I'd get the same decent service, but sadly no.  I ordered and was given a thirty minute time frame for delivery.  An hour later I called the place and was told the driver was allready gone.  Fifteen minutes later the guy shows up, even though the place is less than three miles away.  Nothing was hot or fresh.  Again it was 2:30 on a Wednesday, they should not have been busy.  Epic fail."}
{"text":"Probably the worst pizza experience of my life. I ordered two pizzas online. I usually have no problem ordering online but this was just ridiculous. My ready to pick up time was suppose to be 7:12pm. I ended up getting to Pizza Hut to pick it up around 7:20 and it wasn't ready. So I waited and when they showed me, one of my pizzas had the wrong toppings. The first girl who helped was very nice about it but still I was pretty annoyed that i waited longer than I should have. Girl#1 tells girl#2 that they made the wrong pizza and girl#2 says well what does she want us to do? And girl#1 says she wants us to make her the correct pizza (girl#1 is way nicer by the way). So they keep going back and forth and girl#2 is just not understanding that I just want another pizza to replace the one they messed up. I'm very annoyed at this point because i shouldn't have had to wait this long in the first place, so I go up to girl#2 and tell her I just want what I ordered and then she tells me I'm going to have to pay for another pizza. I'm very irritated and confused at this point. I ask her why I have to pay for another pizza if they are the ones who did not get my order correctly in the first place. We go back and forth for a few minutes and I just tell her what I wanted on my new pizza and she says that they're just going to make me another one. At this point I'm over it. I just want my pizzas and to go home. And after I walk away girl#2 asks girl#1 which pizza I wanted!!!! So I am livid at this point and I walk back up to the counter and tell the girl what kind of pizza I wanted. I had to show her on my phone what I had ordered even though she was holding the receipt in her hand and I had to remind her of the wings I ordered also. When I finally ended up getting both pizzas, the first one was already cold. There was a lot of people complaining about how their orders were not ready on time also. Most likely won't return to this Pizza Hut location anymore."}
{"text":"Ordered their new pan pizza with stuffed crust.. Once delivered, my family started to eat and had complete dough in their mouths. Everyone was disgusted and spit it out immediately. I called Pizza Hut, the first guy I spoke to was extremely kind and had great customer service. He apologized and asked if I could be placed on hold to speak to a manager. Immediately upon answering the phone the manager was annoyed, as he had been given a heads up. He first decided to tell me that \"no one else had complained about their pizza tonight.\" I find that not only extremely rude to tell me - but pointless, quite frankly I don't care - I paid money for dinner for my family and we received something inedible. He asked if I would just like a regular pizza. Seeing how I ordered a specific item and that item cost more - I'd like what I ordered, simply to be cooked. He said they would remake it and send it out for delivery immediately. Awesome. Thank you. Once the remake was delivered, the driver acted flabbergasted I wasn't tipping again. I'm sorry.. I work in a tipping industry, I tip and tip well. But when I'm charged a delivery fee and tip the first time - I'm just not forking out a second tip.. Come on though, I'd be tipping nearly 100% of what I paid for pizza.. Wasn't sure if he was ever going to leave my door. Open the pizza and it's half black. Burnt to a crisp. With a folded up receipt inside the box - disgusting - that as you'll see said \"WELL DONE!!\" I didn't want charcoal. Simply a cooked pizza!! I'm so frustrated with this experience and I can honestly say I will not be back to this location. It took almost two hours to finally feed my family when all was said and done. A few pieces were inedible and had to be tossed. And there was literally NO cheese in the \"stuffed crust\" after baking the daylights out of it. AND everyone has a stomach ache to top it off. I could've got double the pizza - and edible -getting Little Cesars stuffed crust."}
{"text":"This is a great Pizza Hut location!  On our first couple nights in Pittsburgh, my husband and I ordered from here online.  They delivered it to our hotel--the pizza was hot (and delicious, compared to most Pizza Hut locations), the delivery was quick, and the drivers were friendly.

Now I'm sure there are better local pizza joints around, but we needed dinner and we needed it delivered--Pittsburgh streets are scary!  I would recommend this place to anyone in a similar situation, or Pizza Hut lovers near Shadyside..."}

{"text":"this store lost its credibility to me! the actual store manager was smoking a blunt just outside the store!!! i ordered a pizza for carry-out!!!! when i got to the store, i parked next to a car with 5 people hanging outside smoking weed! the smell was so overwhelming! as i got out of the car, i saw this lady wearing pizza hut's shirt, pizza hut hat and a name tag that says \"ashley\". she then joined the group of people that's smoking weed and a guy handed her a blunt and she smoked it as well. i went inside the store to pay for my order then 5mins later, that girl ashley went inside the store using the other door for delivery drivers, i was surprised! she is literally under the influence of marijuana while on the job!!!!! that was so unbelievable!! dont go to this store!!! the people that are preparing your food are high as fuck!!!! 2 thumbs down!!"}
{"text":"We ordered carry-out from this location using their website. What I really liked about the order process was being able to place order without having to create an account or enter an address. Email, name, phone.

We placed order at 11:58pm, received email confirmation, that did not include pickup time estimate, but that was ok. We picked it up exactly 12 minutes after ordering, and the pizza was great! 

Parking was easy, as there is a huge parking lot behind the store."}
{"text":"Terrible pizza, terrible staff, terrible delivery. They specialize in the terrible everything. We've had 2 bad experiences in a row with this location. They make the wrong orders and wont follow simple instructions. For the money they charge, they clearly have no management or concept of customer services whatsoever."}
{"text":"Yikes the reviews are terrible and I do know why, my delivery experience was horrible. Charged for a drink I didn't receive was told they don't to \"to go\" drink orders. Ok no big deal I get it but I was told otherwise specifically when I ordered, and charged for it. The estimated delivery time was 40 minutes and in reality i waited 1 hour and 30 minutes, this resulted in my pizza get cold. So cold pizza, double the wait time and no soda which was paid for and fully anticipated. For a starving pregnant woman this is problematic. The only reason this is not 1 star is because management was super cool. Alex, the manager on duty gave me several options to rectify the situation, and genuinely seemed to care about me being upset, it seems he puts up with a lot. He was pleasant over the phone, everyone I talked to was really nice. I appreciate how he handled the situation."}
{"text":"Ordered from this location again tonight. This is the last time.  The lady at the front literally did not care that they were completely behind. Ordered my pizza at 6 and still not done by 8. After not seeing my order, said she found it and it was in the oven then came back later to say it wasn't even in the oven and two people were still ahead of me. Another guy came in to pick up his order and was told 20 people were still ahead of him with no time frame of when his food would be done and she completely could not have cared less that it was supposed to be done. Staff does not wear food handler gloves. They eat while they work and scream profanities while the customers are coming in and out. There were no less than 50 dirty disgusting pans stacked up that were falling all on the floor while they stood around in a group of about 5 guys just laughing at the one that actually picked up the mess. This place is gross and i wish i would have found this out earlier. They lost 2 customers in the span of about 5 minutes. Great job! Not."}
{"text":"My first time ordering from this place and I ordered Chicken Alfredo and breadsticks and online it said it would be delivered in 40 minutes. I receive a call almost an hour later, asking me if I received my food. I hadn't... She then said something about someone taking my food and I then get told they are going to investigate and get back to me. I call 30 minutes later and she says that the food was never made, someone said they made it, but they couldn't have because they are out of chicken Alfredo. At this point my friends and I are starving so we just order a pizza and breadsticks. I get told we will have it in 20 minutes. I call 30 minutes later and they ask for my address... Seriously? Is this real life... I ordered food at 7:45 and now it is 10:15 and I haven't received it yet."}
{"text":"Miserable and I repeat MISERABLE experience at this location. I placed my order at 6:45 and it was supposed to be ready by 7:22. So I arrive to carry it out at 7:20 hoping it would be done early. It in fact was quite the opposite. I remained seated by the counter until almost 8:20, am hour after I had arrived for \"carry out\". When I complained to the manager she told me that they ran out of crust and a million other excuses for why I wasted essentially an hour plus of my life. To her defense, she did give me my pizza and a 2 liter for free, but there needs to be a serious employee overhaul at this location, since aside from the manager all the other employees seem to have their heads firmly planted between their butt cheeks."}

{"text":"Called in my order at 10:30pm on a Saturday night, and I arrived 15 minutes later to two fresh piping hot pizzas with my name on them. The service was fast, the pizza tasted as I expect Pizza Hut pizza to taste, and the staff was friendly when I needed to change my order and while I picked up my order. I will definitely carry out again.

Note, most the complaints are for guests that had delivery, I have no experience with this Pizza Hut and their delivery service"}

{"text":"I called in to this Pizza Hut just about 5 minutes ago and upon the first words of the \"store manager\" I was appalled at her profession. I was asking to hear about prices and specials however she would not inform me of anything until I Gave her my address. I did not know if I was going to order anything so I asked to just hear prices and her answer was \"no.\" I work in the customer service industry I can understand how busy things may get however no possible customer should hear a no to a request. Bad business. The manager should be trained more for customer service not speed of service. Do not recommend until she gets training"}
{"text":"This place is trash!!!!! Had a roach in my pizza and damn near threw up I was so grossed out. They acted as if nothing happened. I have never had Pizza Hut from this location ever and I've had Pizza Hut with friends once since.  This place ruined my experience and I'd be careful from messing with this place"}
{"text":"Gave them 1 star because I can't rate them zero. I don't know if they changed management recently but the new \"manager\" sucks. She LIES for no reason. This used to be my go to Pizza Hut but she ruined that experience for me. They messed up my pizza and gave me a credit for next time. Turns out there was no credit given. Tried to make me feel like I was in the wrong when all I wanted was to get my pizza with the credit that was given to me. I didn't come off as an angry customer either. She shouldn't have been qualified to be a manager. The way she handled the situation was unprofessional. Before these two situations that happened back to back, I was fine with the customer service. It only takes one to ruin it for everybody."}
{"text":"I ordered a pepperoni pan pizza with mushrooms on half, regular on cheese and sauce. It was very bland tasting. They were heavy on the cheese which muted the flavor of the pepperoni and sauce. My taste buds screamed for some hot sauce and I regretted not requesting buffalo sauce on the side. That would've made it better."}
{"text":"I don't usually order pizza as much as I used to, but this Pizza Hut was right across the street from my house and they are actually much friendlier and quicker than most other Pizza Hut places I've ordered from.

Granted, this is a chain so you're going to get chain pizza.

Will it break the mold and make your mouth water? Probably not, but it's convenient, it's fair priced (always take advantage of coupons), and fast."}
{"text":"Your usual Pizza Hut, plus Wing Street. Buffet lunch and on Tuesday evenings. Wing specials on Wednesday. They have a drive thru window for carry out which is nice. Deliver, and quickly, throughout town. Clean inside. Nothing wrong here. Only thing bad I have to say is they don't participate in all the national promotions. For instance, the $10 any pizza promo recently was not offered here."}
{"text":"Great customer service, I will be coming back to this pizza hut. The food was also delicious :-)"}
{"text":"I have ordered from this location on numerous occasions for work lunches. I had started to get bad experiences such as employees arguing with me over not wanting to order extra meat on my pizza, getting the order wrong, and even having it delivered to a different location. Yesterday was the first time in a long while I ordered from them and it was because my manager really wanted it. I ordered online as I usually do. This time the ordering was very annoying because it kept adding crazy quantities and changing the sizes when I would go to check out. On a side note, the offer for two mediums at $6.99 each is still offered on the menu but when you try to order it it states that the location doesn't honor that coupon. I've tried at home and work which are across town and neither accept it. Why have it offered if it won't be honored at any location? Anyway, I ordered what I thought was two medium pizzas. When the pizzas came I was sure they had gotten something wrong because it looked like I had gotten a small pizza and a medium. That would have been only one wrong size. When I looked at the receipt I realized that I had actually needed one medium and a large because of the way the ordering kept changing at checkout. So what I thought was small was the medium were actually what they considered a medium and large now. I tried calling the store and was put on hold. After 8 mins I hung up. I called back once I took the pizza back for everyone and was again on hold for over 10 mins before hanging up and just leaving a comment on their site. I took a picture of the small plates we were using so a comparison could be seen. I spent $35 dollars for these two pizzas! I am so upset that these could be passed off as acceptable. The only reason I gave two stars is because the pizza itself was done correctly and was decent tasting. The delivery person was polite. But once again they never have peppers or cheese on hand. I'll post the pictures. If you are in this area try Mama DePalmas."}
{"text":"Ordered 2 large pizzas and when we got the pizza it was all crust. The slice was half crust and half toppings. They went cheap on the toppings as well. Ordered a supreme and they cheated us on the toppings. I don't think we will be ordering from this Pizza Hut again . The last time we ordered from this Pizza Hut they didn't cut our pizza. We always ordered from this Pizza Hut but lately the quality has gone down."}
{"text":"I ordered $28 in pizza from 6671 E Baseline Rd in Mesa. I ordered it well done as I always do, because usually it's pretty doughy. I also asked that it be cut into at least 10 pieces. When my daughter got home, one of the crusts was so dark brown that it was inedible already, let alone reheating in oven. Also, in each pizza were about 5 slices about 1\" wide. I called the store and asked for the manager and spoke to Chelsea. I explained this to her, and she asked me if I wanted them remade. I told her yes, and that I would have my daughter bring them along back to the store, 5 miles away, and she said ok. No form of apology. My daughter picked them up the second time and they looked good. I then called Chelsea and let her know this, and because of the experience, without so much as a coupon for a few dollars off our next pizza, we would not return, and she said \"I'm sorry about that\" and hung up. Evidently our plans, time and gas mean nothing and if this is the type of service that Pizza Hut gives, then I won't be returning to any of them. The fact the pizza was burnt and the extra pieces were one inch wide, seriously? The LEAST that should've been done is to deliver the corrected pizzas. I emailed a Pizza Hut Corp office regarding my response, and they didn't even acknowledge the email."}
{"text":"This location is awful I'm not sure who's running the establishment but I ordered two Canadian pizzas yesterday, they skimped on the sauce, cheese and every single topping. I use to order pizza hut all the time years ago from the other location before they moved and it was never this bad. Two thumbs down !"}

Delivery drivers always seem very friendly, pizza seems to be constantly fresh and hot. If you use the Deals***
when ordering online they always have great deals."}
{"text":"Terrible!! Where do I start, the crust was disgusting undercooked and each piece of my large pepperoni pizza had about one and a half slices of pepperoni on it, if I would have known that I would have ordered double pepperoni, and what very little cheese there was on the pizza was a very, strange rubbery consistency, not even sure if it was cheese ugh. I wasted my time and I wasted my money, won't catch me in there ever again!"}
{"text":"My husband ordered pizza over the phone for delivery tonight and the price was a bit high. I called back n asked for the online special and the gal said we had to either have a coupon or order online. I had her cancel the order, told her it was no trouble n that id order online, and requested that the pizza be fresh cuz last time it wasn't when I ordered online. It was cold and gross when it was delivered. Tonight the pizza arrived early, super fresh, and it was delicious! Using the online specials I got 2-large pizzas cheaper than the 2-mediums."}
{"text":"I'm not sure why this location has bad reviews, as I've only ever had great service and good food at this store. 

Pizza Hut is a pretty standard chain, and everything should taste the same from store to store. I know this because I worked at one for 2 years in high school. (Boom. I know. Your mind just exploded.)

I love their breadsticks with cheese dipped in ranch dressing. Zomg. Love the herbs they use. You want comfort food? Here you go. On a PLATTER. I've gotten so many people hooked on this combo, it's hiiiiiilarious. 

I also like their stuffed crust pizza, garlic bread, and caesar salad. Not fussy on their pasta's at all though, tres bland. Dessert pizzas and Chocolate Dunkers are good though. And that new giant cookie pizza thing too? I've gotten it burnt on the bottom a few times now that I think about out. Hmmm....."}
{"text":"Dean was great, even on what was obviously a crazy busy night. Customer service was fantastic, we ordered online and picked up the pizzas which where nice and hot! Got home and everything was perfect, crazy half pizza toppings on both. 
I would definitely recommend the crushed tomato sauce over the traditional style, it reminds me of how their sauce was growing up.

Thanks for a great pizza Friday!!"}
{"text":"Ordered a medium pizza online @5pm for pickup @7:15 pm. The pizza wasn't even ready and my wife had to wait additional 15 minutes! When she brought the pizza home it looked like it was pulled from the trash and was beyond salty. So salty in fact you could see the salt crystals on top of pepperoni (see attached pics) ! Pizza Hut is  world's worse pizza. Stay far away from this portal to hell. You have been warned."}
{"text":"Not Impressed!   Stopped in to order a Personal pan Pizza,  was told they were out of them.  So I ordered a small order of chicken wings.  It took over 30 minutes for me to get them & I had to ask.  After that long wait the wings were cold.    On a good note the staff was pleasant."}
{"text":"I always order from this location, they are awesome! Usually on time or early and always get my order right! I order from here quite a bit and they've only messed up twice, which is impressive considering how often I order, and they've fixed it right away with a great attitude. Great customer service, and great food!"}
{"text":"I haven't eaten at a Pizza Hut, or ordered from them in about 5 years! With theses new 2 for 1 places Pizza Hut is really not worth the price. I ordered delivery from this place, and it took 1 hour before it arrived. I was really unimpressed, the pizza was cold, so i had to put it in the oven to heat it up.

I got really sick after eating, total heart burn kept me up all night. I only ordered from here because I had a 10$ coupon. I will stick to my 2 for 1 pizza places from now on.
Pizza hut isn't what it used to be."}
{"text":"Called for delivery at 8pm and and after 1 hour and 30 minutes we still haven't received our pizza so we called and asked the status. They said all of a sudden it would take 2-3 hours for delivery and they NEVER told us. When we asked to speak with the manager (James) he was very rude and said, \"I can only apologize so much\" - the funny thing was that he only said \"I'm sorry\" once but regardless you can tell that all he cared about was getting off the phone. Very poor customer service. When customers call to place and order for delivery they should inform their customers of how long to expect and if an unforeseen situation came up where deliveries are going to take longer than expected they should let the customer know. Management really needs to learn some manners and talk to their customers in a polite and professional way- had that happened it would have diffused the situation at LEAST..."}
{"text":"Because I can't give zero stars. WHAT HAS HAPPENED TO PIZZA HUT??? It used to be my favorite pizza. Now every time I order it is under cooked or the wrong pizza. Good customer service is not to be found anywhere in this place. When I told the \"manager\" they they delivered the wrong pizza he acted like it was my fault because the kids already ate some.  Then I told him the pan pizza was undercooked and cold and doughey, he told me that is impossible, our pizzas are cooked on a conveyor belt. Then was like, we can pick it up... the kids already ate half of it I told him, they don't know any difference... they see pizza they are going to eat it. Now I hope they don't get sick from eating under cooked dough. 
What a mess Pizza Hut has become, I guess you get what you pay for now days and $7.99 for a pizza that sucks isn't a good deal."}
{"text":"This location would not honor my online coupon. The manager, Jill, is extremely unhelpful in resolving issues."}
{"text":"They are ALWAYS out of personal pans. Always. The last time I tried to figure out a solution for this issue they hung up on me. Lol. I was just trying to help because clearly no one else is..."}
{"text":"Order the chicken and red onions pizza WITH the hand tossed crust and NO drip or flavor added (to crust). Excellent."}
{"text":"Always just the worse. Whether it's waiting 1 hour in-store for my pre-ordered pizza pickup, or it's a destroyed cheese pizza from delivery. Always terrible."}
{"text":"They dont answer the phone. We had to go directly there and order and wait what seemed like forever to get our food. Lucky they have stuffed crust or we would never order from there again"}
{"text":"I hadn't had Pizza Hut in years!  My dad just had knee surgery and this Pizza Hut is next to his PT facility.  He suggested my husband and I pick up pizza and wings for the 4 of us.  I was pleasantly surprised!  I was expecting greasy, thick crust pizza.  I'm sure you can order different types of crust but their standard crust is delicious, thin and crispy.  We ordered half sausage, mushroom and onions and half pepperoni and tomatoes.  The pizza was so good!  I know I tasted some really good garlic and their sauce was good too.  We ordered the garlic and parmesan wings....also very delicious.  I'd definitely go back for pizza and wings!"}
{"text":"I was happy with this place. I had bariatric surgery and can't eat bread but really wanted pizza. I called them and asked if they could make a crustless pizza. They seemed a little confused but were willing to try. They put the toppings, sauce and cheese in a tin pan and sent it through the oven. It melted the cheese and gave me a good pizza taste. I appreciated their willingness to meet my needs and would go back."}
{"text":"4 stars for cleanliness, friendly and helpful staff. If you like pizza hut this is a good location to go to."}
{"text":"This location stated that they were too busy for deliveries and suggested a try one of their competitors... Really?"}
{"text":"Every time we order from here it's never done on time!!! I can see why they only have 1 star! The customer service is horrible!!! My husband is there right now and still waiting on our pizza to be done and he told the cashier that it's never don't at the time it says it will be and the cashier response was \"Ok\". Not \"I'm sorry sir we will get it out as soon as we can\"!!!"}
{"text":"Good service, I was in and out in 10 minutes, as cashier told, only reason why not five stars, I though it was pricy, large pizza, 16 chicken wings, and a 2 liter drink $28.65."}
{"text":"I live 30 seconds away from this location and the store says I cannot order online and they tried to upsell me from the online deal that they have. Do not go to this location if possible. Just another way for Pizza Hut to try to scam people into buying something that they don't give the right order for. 

I'll never go back to this location again."}
{"text":"Not a huge fan of this location. My past experience has been delivery and carry out. The first time I ordered my delivery was 45 mins late. My food was cold. The driver was nice he just was lost and instead of calling he was walking around the complex trying to locate our office. The second time I did carry out. Well my food was prepared in a timely manner though I did not realize it until I got back to the office that my full order was not there. I was missing several wings in which I paid for. I did call the location and they credit my account for future orders. The location was super busy though holding a very professional demeanor in serving everyone who walked through the door."}
{"text":"I had minimal communication with the fat ugly mexican delivery girl and she was very unprofessional. Wouldnt take the pizza all the way out of the bag and i came outside, she had thrown my receipt on the ground"}
{"text":"Worst service ever. I walked in and was yelled at from the back  \"hey! I'll be with you in a min!\" The manager came from the back and asked me if she was making my order. Like I knew what she was doing before I walked in. She then informed me they couldn't make our stuffed garlic knots because they were out I asked her if she could make my pizzas stuffed crust instead since it was the only reason we ordered Pizza Hut  and she told me that the knots were like 5 bucks and she couldn't do that. I told her I didn't want the order anymore and she seem offended so I told her it would have been nice if she called and told me that they couldn't make my order and she seem speechless and was trying to come up with and excuse which she could.  Try libbrettos next store. Much better pizza and customer service"}
{"text":"This is my neighborhood Pizza Hut. I've ordered from here since I moved to Mesa, 7 years ago. I always preferred Pizza Hut over any other franchise pizza place. The last time I ordered from there, they really dropped the ball, TWICE!

So, I ordered last Saturday, and I upgraded my meal from breadsticks to cheese sticks for an additional cost. My meal also came with cinna-sticks. When the food arrived, instead of cheese sticks, I got bread sticks, with a heavy sprinkling of cinnamon and sugar. I called the location, and after being transferred 3 times, and 2 reps basically telling me I didn't exist as a customer because my order had been delivered, so I wasn't in the system, I got to speak with a manager. The manager offered to have someone come back out and bring the cheese sticks. So, I agreed. 15 minutes later, an unhappy looking delivery girl shows up, shoves a bag of bread in my face, and says, \"here\", and walks away. No apology, no have a good day, nothing. And do you know what she brought? BREAD STICKS! Not cheese sticks that I paid for, and waited extra for, but bland and unflavored carb sticks! 

Sorry Pizza Hut, but I'm done with you. This location failed so hard that day, that I will no longer be doing business with you. This economy sucks, and people don't like to spend money on eating fast food. You should treat your customers like you care, and actually appreciate their business. I have many pizza choices in my area, and now my choices have been narrowed down because I won't be ordering from you guys anymore."}
{"text":"A local favorite of mine. My favorite thing about this Pizza Hut is the lunch buffet. No wait to get food! It's perfect for a quick lunch break at work. They even offer to go buffet! The price is decent enough. I don't feel like I have to eat to much to get my money's worth. The plates and silverware are always clean. The salad looks fresh and the lettuce crisp! The pizza is always piping hot and they offer a good selection. The pizza pizza bar always has breadsticks, garlic bread, pasta and a dessert as well. Always cheese pizza available for vegetarians and young kids. The kids always enjoy the kiddie area with a tv and toys. It's a good bet for all family members"}
{"text":"I left on Google map, too. Don't order any pizza here. I ordered 4 times to make sure that they are truly careless. Every time I ordered they miss ingredients. Pizza is always cold. The worst thing is the manager. He is young boy, really arrogant. It seems that he is looking down customers who don't complain right away. What a shameful business mind."}
{"text":"I have had this store lose my order, take three hours to deliver one pizza and if you call to order within an hour of them closing, they will literally hang up on you half of the time. I love pizza hut but i can't stand having to deal with this store. I wish there was another one I could order from but everywhere I call says I have to order from this one because it's closest to me. So I guess I just can't order pizza hut anymore."}
{"text":"Pros: Consistent quality. I like the pepperoni pizzone and my sister likes the Hershey chocolate sticks. 

Cons: Why would I bother to place my order online hours in advance, if its not going to be ready when I arrive? They didn't even start making it till I got here. Additionally, they got my order wrong! Scary neighborhood and parking lot full. I had to park in the shopping complex next to this one."}
{"text":"I made a phone order for a basic pepperoni pizza while visiting my family.  

The girl on the phone was the meanest, miserable sounding person I have ever heard. She gave me attitude and was very quick to cut me off when I had wanted to ask what the estimated time would be. She didn't even say \"would you like anything else?\" Or say Thank you have a good day. Just ok and click. Now I remember why I left PA, the customer service stinks!! 

When I got the knock on the door, he hands the pizza over so my hands were full from the pizza box, and the delivery guy just shoves me the receipt to sign and the large bottle drink. So what happens?? I end up dropping stuff obviously. Are you stupid? You didn't even say sorry or try to help lol. Give me like two seconds to put the box down GEEZ. 

Never ever ordering here again. I'll just stick to those Italian ma and pa shops if I visit my fam again. Good riddance."}
{"text":"Tried again tonight. Three hours and 15 minutes to three hours and 25 minutes for delivery. What? What is the issue here guys? I tried calling the 1-800 and was on hold for 20 minutes before I gave up. Worst delivery Pizza Hut hands down."}
{"text":"I have ordered from this place two times, and both times my order was wrong.  How does a pizza place screw up a two topping pizza? Not only was it wrong, it was cold and tasted so bad that the teenage neighbor boys wouldn't even eat it.  Yuck!"}
{"text":"If you like your pizza late everytime this is the location to order from.  Minimum 10 minutes late.  I've had times where they were over an hour late.  Each time you call it's the same \"oh the driver left already and should be there soon.\"  Heard that excuse 3 times when they were over an hour late.  If it's bad weather then sure, I understand.  It's like they don't care if it's late cause you still have to pay."}
{"text":"This pizza hit makes great pizza. Way better than dominoes. If ur looking for a fast delivery option of this style pizza, this location is one of the best. The thin crust is very crunchy and good."}
{"text":"I wish that I could offer a less than 1 star rating. This is the worst pizza establishment I have ever encountered. I ordered via the website 10 minutes prior to opening, expecting a prompt delivery. More than 2 hours later and no delivery is here, the manager called me a liar when I said I didn't receive a call from the driver seeking help with directions and told me that the GM was too busy to call me back. Do yourself a favor and NEVER order from here!"}
{"text":"Service was great, pizza was hot and good. Reminded me of Pizza Hut back in the day. We had kind of forgotten about Pizza Hut but this surprise visit was so good we will be back to eat here again."}
{"text":"BELIEVE THE REVIEWS! This place was just as it is reviewed. I ordered a large pizza and some wings. When I went to pick it up, the place appeared dingy. One employee was scratching his head and did not wash his hands before touching the food. When I received my food all seemed okay. However when i went to eat a wing, I came across a long brown hair. After just about throwing up, i threw out the food. I will never go back."}
{"text":"PIZZA HUT!! After the whole $10 for any pizza promotion my boy and I started using Pizza Hut.  It is the BEST!!!!!  The thin crust supreme is so good.  we are totally addicted.  We always get the spicy boneless wings, and two large supreme pizzas (so we have left overs) and it comes to about $30.  Staff is friendly and English speaking.  The delivery is fast."}
{"text":"I went here with my friend Abram today to try out their Saturday all-you-can-eat buffet, which is held from 11:00 am to 2:00 pm. (Reservations are not required.)

First impressions: we were seated in the western-facing pièce à côté. We both immediately noticed a slightly off-putting musty smell in that area of the restaurant. We were left to wonder if we had been relegated to the stinky room for some reason beyond our knowledge. 

Our waiter offered us drinks and invited us to help ourselves to the buffet. We started with the salad which was uniquely unoffensive. Just like a normal salad bar. One strike against the salad bar, though, was that the dressing situation left much to be desired; there was no blue cheese dressing to be found. I ended up using oil and vinegar and Abram used ranch. So far, okay. 

However, when we approached the pizza buffet, we found cause for concern. One thing that struck me as being suspicious was that none of the pizzas were missing any slices. However, isn't this logically impossible? Do the patrons all take whole pizzas? Or does the staff replace the slices one at a time? How do you figure out which is the old slice, and which is the fresh slice? Later I observed staff replacing a full meat lover's pizza with a newer meat lover's pizza. Apparently, absent my and Abram's pizza consumption, this buffet would just have been full pizzas being replaced by other full pizzas, periodically throughout the afternoon.

The pizza, itself, was pretty groty. It didn't really taste like Pizza Hut pizza. Instead, it tasted more like a shittier version of something you would buy at Copp's that was like a frozen pizza in a Pizza Hut-branded box. Something we noticed was that all of the crusts had been brushed with a groty fake garlic butter sauce. I call it \"the grote coat.\" I opted not to eat any of my pizza crusts. Abram noticed that some of the older pepperoni slices had particularly arid, crunchy pepperoni on them. It also bears noting that the buffet featured the ghastly, unholy phenomenon of the taco pizza, which clearly had been sitting there for hours, untouched by any patrons.

However, none of this offended Abram as much as the appearance of the mutant dessert-pizzas on the buffet. At the end of the buffet were several sugary items meant to be consumed at the end of the meal as a sick sort of dessert-substitute. Abram was particularly displeased by the cherry strudel-like pizza dish they served. I, myself, partook of only one cinnamon stick. It was like a normal Pizza Hut breadstick, except it didn't have the garlic and Parmesan stuff, and instead it was covered in what appeared like a creamy, sugary jizz. 

The place was well-staffed with pleasant-natured people. They checked in on us periodically, but Abram noticed that they never asked us how the food was; instead repeatedly inquired whether we were ok. As though they were mainly concerned for our well-being.

All-in-all, I had four pieces of pizza and Abram had five. When we returned to Abram's place, he felt as though he needed to take a walk to burn off all of the dirty, gross calories he had at Pizza Hut, but was afraid if he went for a walk, he might have an accident. Instead, we stayed in and made a spreadsheet of Madison bar drink specials, and Abram had to use the bathroom three times.

We are giving this place two stars because, in Abram's words, \"It was cheap; and it was close; and we should have known better.\""}
{"text":"Received wrong pizza. Called the store and was told I could come back and pick up the right pizza, no problem right? When i got there they wanted to charge me again and tried to blame me. Poor customer service. Avoid this place!"}
{"text":"I orderedonlina one of their vegie pizzas. When I opened the box at home, I found  a burnt pizza with a shred of cheese.. so bad"}
{"text":"Didn't even pick up the phone went to order online. The had no stuffed crust pizzas for maybe the sixth time in 3 months when I have tried to order."}
{"text":"It was great the first few times I ordered but recently it's  just been awful. Today I ordered a pizza, it took it and hour and a half to get to me. I called after 1 hour and the manger just said sorry even though it was promised to me at 3:20 and if was 3:45, when I ordered at 2:30. He acted very \"oh well\" about it.  I called again 30 min after that and I was told to call back when the manager came back. When I was about to call back at 4:05 the delivery  boy showed up. He was really polite and all, but i hadn't thought that they only took cash  (my bad I know ). Delivery  boy called the manager and they offered me $5 off my order, but since he was already dispatched they couldn't give me any discounts. So they offered me $5 off my next order.  After all that was done, I opened my pizza and they delivered me the wrong pizza. I ordered pepperoni and got onion and pepper. I called back and the manager said that he'll remake the pizza but a large this time and reminded me that I have $5 off my next order. I don't think I will be ordering again."}
{"text":"Consistently terrible.  Last pizzas didn't even have enough toppings and cheese to cover the surface of the pie.  One pizza had smashed misshapen crust, too.  Every time I order, it reminds me why I haven't ordered in so long!"}
{"text":"Clean store. Well cooked delicious pizza every time! Friendly staff. Wish they delivered to my home but it's worth going to pick up! Repeat customer. Never an issue."}
{"text":"Why the hell do they let dogs inside of this place...that's disgusting..what goes on in the back?!!.. .I'll be getting a refund soon"}
{"text":"Got the pizza after 45 minutes , the pizza was cold I had to put it in the oven for another 10 minutes. 
Taste was very bad . The pizza was way too much oily I felt like I eat oil and not pizza . Will Never order from them again ."}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised.

We were looking to get a pizza, and quickly. It was too hot to go out, but we debated on whether or not to get Pizza Hut. What we don't like about it is that the pizza never seems to be baked long enough for our taste. We like the cheese to be a bit browned. The cheese on their pizzas always seems to be just melted and warmed through. 

Anyway, we saw that they had new flavors, and chose the 'Flavor of Now' Cock-a-doodle bacon pizza, hand tossed. Silly name, but the ingredients sounded good. Creamy garlic parmesan sauce, grilled chicken, hardwood smoked bacon, diced roma tomatoes and toasted parmesan crust.

The sauce was great, very flavorful. I love tomatoes on pizza, the taste changes a bit to make them tangy. The chicken did not seem to be grilled, but more like frozen strips of chicken that were thawed and heated through. However, the crust was excellent with the toasted parmesan.  I would prefer that the crust be more of an artisan thin crust, and the cheese baked a bit longer...but this was a pretty tasty pizza. I would definitely order this again. 

Our delivery guy was great also. Very pleasant. I placed my order online, using my credit card. Although I was told to show my card at delivery, this was not necessary. There was no place to add a tip online, but he brought the receipt for me to sign, and there was a line to add a tip on this."}
{"text":"We r getting pizza tonight carry out of course. 1 pizza 2 orders of wings and a side of bread sticks. This place is a carry out only and they r pretty fast. The people working in here r pretty nice. I placed my order on line and now there is a count down on the computer telling how long ur order will be we left like 45seconds BC we r really close to this pizza hut and by the time I got here my order was not ready. It was ready."}
{"text":"Awful. Just plain awful.  Service and food. Yeah pizza hut is not the greatest, but sometimes you crave it out of nostalgia. My pizza came out under cooked and soggy. Plus the employees were just rude and super ghetto!"}
{"text":"Not a bad place to have pizza. They remodeled the place and it looks a lot better than it used to."}
{"text":"I've gone thru this pizza hut for the most part they're ok. Quick an easy. Not really digging them tonight usually you get marinara dipping sauce for the garlic knots, and got nothing."}
{"text":"Pizza Hut's $10 deal of the day is great! Just be sure to order through online

Pros: 
- Price: My recommendation would be to get the $10 deal of the day. You can get large or medium for the same price! This offer is only available through ordering online. Keep in mind that if you order regular price, you will be paying higher pricing. 
- Parking: Tons of parking in the lot! 
- Wait times: The wait times are pretty good if you order online. My order is always ready and you can always see it on the large TV they have hanging up. You can always go the other shops in the plaza to see whats available. 
- Food: The food is very consistent for every time I've ordered. 


Deals of the Day (All of the pizzas are Pan pizzas, so yummy!): 
Sunday: Triple Crown - Pepperoni, mushrooms, crisp green peppers and  Pizza Mozzarella
Monday: Hawaiian - Ham, Pineapple, Mozzarella.
Tuesday: Pepperoni 
Wednesday: Canadian - Pepperoni, bacon bits mushrooms and mozzarella
Thursday: Supreme Lovers - Pepperoni, mild sausage, beef topping, green pepper, mushrooms, red onion and mozzarella.

Saturday: Veggie Lovers - Mushrooms, green pepper, red onion, ripe tomato and pizza mozzarella"}
{"text":"When in to order a pizza at 11pm and was standing there for about 15 mins just to order 1 pizza. I've called out hello multiple times and no one can hear me. I can see the employees standing around talking to each other and not pay attention to the from. I didnt even get a sorry or a hello. Hands down the worse customer service ever. And please stop taking about your personal life, if you want to then make sure the customers aren't hearing you cuss up a storm about your personal life."}
{"text":"I ordered a pan pizza, which I had to pay extra for (got hand tossed), and breadsticks (didn't get marinara). They screwed up both items in my order. I ordered online, so I don't see how it could have gotten confused."}
{"text":"Just ordered for my children.  Not only was the pizza doughy and undercooked, but there was a hair in the chicken.  I tried calling the store several times and when I didn't get an answer I called the help line.  The first time the call mysteriously disconnected, the second time I couldn't got through, the third time I was told to hold and got disconnected again.  I will never order from here or any pizza Hut again.  This is horrible customer service, terrible food and an absolute waste of money."}
{"text":"Very disappointed with this location. 2 out of the last 3 times, my pizza was not made correctly nor was it fresh when it was delivered or picked up. The \"manager\" (who immediately claimed to be the manager as soon as I said I would like to complain about my order, sound fishy at all?) was totally disrespectful when I called to complain and told me that I did not order the pizza correctly. I  asked for extra sauce on my pizza, I clicked on it online. how is there a wrong way to do that? He then suggested that I click it twice for extra extra sauce when in reality that marks and unmarks the box for extra sauce. He told me that he had been back there making all the pizzas all day and that he made it just how I ordered it. He then proceeded to tell me to have a nice day and hung up on me. Unbelievable. If I could give them no stars, I would."}
{"text":"Just moved to the area so we ordered online delivery which is delivered from this location.  We ordered a stuffed crusted supreme, breadstix w/marinara, 2 liter soda and according to the website u get a 2 liter pepsi max free. Delivered order earlier than expected which is good and it usually is BUT missing soda. You gotta have soda with your pizza.  I dont care that they didnt have the free soda but they should have called me that they coudnt complete my order.  Was disappointed!  I love pizza hut but NOT delivery from this locaton."}
{"text":"Ordered on the app and got a call 1 minute after ordering and was told the delivery driver's car broke down. Twice before they missed their delivery time and forgot a drink and had to go back and get it. I don't know why this location can't get it together. I've never had a problem with Pizza Hut until this one popped up. Previously my roommate's experience was so bad they sent him $40 in free gift cards. I can't say I'd recommend this location when the Papa John's a block away is always consistent."}
{"text":"I would give this place 0 stars if I could. Terrible customer service. I ordered delivery a few times and every time the driver takes close to 2 hours if not more! My food is always cold and doesn't taste fresh at all. I am a fan of Pizza Hut but I would suggest that you do not visit this location."}
{"text":"So we ordered a white cheese pizza with spinach and was COMPLETELY DISAPPOINTED. Every pizza place I have ordered from has always melted their spinach within their cheese. Below is what I received . I will not recommend ordering a spinach pizza from here. They just threw the spinach on there"}
{"text":"Makes really good pizza but unfortunately their delivery time is so late you might as well drive down and pick it up yourself--not that they make the pizzas in a timely manner either."}
{"text":"This was a horrible experience. We ordered takeout and I was going to pick it up. They said it would be ready in 30 minutes............ well that definitely was not the case. I actually showed up 45 minutes later so I could be in and out, and my order was not even filled yet. I waited for another hour which I should not have but I am a pretty understanding and patient person. When I finally get my whole order a hour later it was no apologies, no comp, not anything. I received a poor attitude when I received my order and what's even worse was I found out who took my order and she was sitting down waiting for her ride because she was off the clock. SHE WAS THE MANAGER!!!! Wouldn't recommend this place to my enemies."}
{"text":"Horrible please if your buying pizza on a budget just settle for lil ceasers. The pizza is horrible here the wings are greasy as hell. And the customer service sucks!!!!!!!!! I ordered a pizza online 7:40ish it said it will arrive in a hour....... ok and hour goes by I call check on it someone nonchalantly picks up and says it'll be here soon here comes 9 at this point my kids haven't ate dinner there sleepy avatars I don't even want it anymore so I call to get a refund. In the middle of me talking to them they hang up. I call back they hang up. Then they tell me you have to go to the store to get a refund. Then 9:50 Pizza Hut calls in in the lobby. We go ahead and get it anyways the pizza is cold ass hell the wings are greasy like they were never drained just thrown directly in to the bowl. Just horrible don't waste your time or money. And this isn't the first time they took over an hour to deliver  but this will be the last time!"}
{"text":"pizza is trash ! bell peper and onion cut like for animals! pizza was stock in to the box no deli paper ! it was my first and last time i order ! very dissapointed with costumer service ! never order again !"}
{"text":"Rude!!! Worst first experience. Called to order a pizza the guy who was gonna take my order said the wait would be and hour and 40 mins, okay cool places get busy but that wasn't the problem, once I had said yikes, let me see what my husband says the guy just hangs up!! 
Didn't even say bye or anything. 

Never calling this location!! Awful."}
{"text":"I go to this Pizza Hut location all the time and I have never had an issue until today February 24, 2017! My order was suppose to be ready at 5:40pm I understand being a little behind but to let me stand there and wait for my pizza and not tell me until 20 minutes later around 6pm that you ran out of stuff crust and my order has not even been started yet is ridiculous! I heard the cashier tell someone before me that they ran out of stuff crust and they would receive a credit for the price of their pizza and I was only offered $2 credit!!!"}
{"text":"Heard about their deal on medium pizzas and their flavored crusts, so I stopped by around 5:30pm. I put in my order (no limit on toppings so I got two and three for each) and chose their classic crust and their Asiago, the two most popular. I added the Hershey's dark chocolate pie, since they advertised that on TV and in the store as well. Steve told me it would be ten minutes, so I drove across the street to Fry's to buy a few things. By the time I came back, my pizza was being cut and it was almost ready. I had a pleasant experience here and I enjoyed my pizza. The dessert was excellent, very chocolate-y with chips that melt in your mouth. Convenient location and good deals, I'll be back."}
{"text":"This place is horrible. Customer service is awful!!!! Pizza is always cold. They offer you a credit on your next order but then when you want to use your credit they can't find it. It's awful!!!! If I could give 0 stars I would!!!!"}
{"text":"When they say two topping pizza thats what they mean! Two pieces of pepperoni and two pieces of olives! What s rip off! Not a good value! Go somewhere else
Well made a huge mistake and ordered from here again!i paid extra this time for black olives an pepperoni got screwed again! This place needs a new owner!They are incompetent and don't care!
Never again! Do not go here !they will screw you too!"}
{"text":"Excellent pizza and wings! Super fast service very friendly delivery person!
Thank you!"}
{"text":"A little slow, understaffed. We were there just for the Wing Street wings tonight. We ordered 24 wings and waffle fries from the menu . they said they no longer had waffle fries so we said regular fries were fine. The fries turned out to having a breading / coating on them they did not mention  so only 1 person could eat them . we had   plain wings ( for allergen reasons )  but 8 mild as well.  The  mild was very very mild . they were cooked OK.  and oh my gosh for the price , just shy of a dollar a wing these things were TINY. Could have been from Cornish hens .  an standard order of 8 is not enough for a grown up.   So all in all 3 stars at best. We definitely felt ripped and they only tasted \"all right \" at best."}
{"text":"I ordered a large pepperoni pan pizza togo. I normally like pizza hut but for some  reason the pizza seemed way to greasy and didn't taste that great. In fact I got naseous after eating 2 slices."}
{"text":"If I could describe my experience in one word it would be: Hassle. 

I saw the commercial for $5 items if you buy 2 from the menu. I placed my order for delivery for a medium pizza and an order of honey BBQ wings at 12:06PM. I didn't receive my delivery till 2:35PM. Hold your gasps - it gets worse.

After placing the order, my expected delivery said 45 minuites to an hour (which is understandable seeing as it was the lunch hour). However, after about an hour and a half of waiting, I called the store. The person answering the phone was not in a great mood. I asked what the ETA was for my delivery and she said very bluntly, \"it's out for delivery now\" and quickly hung up the phone. Not that I was expecting a full conversation or anything - but there was no explanation, no apology, no sympathy whatsoever. 

An hour after that phone call - I finally got my pizza. Sadly, the pizza I waited so long for was cold and the wings were soggy. 

I tweeted about my experience and they DM'd me and apologized. They refunded my purchase and offered another pizza on the house. I appreciate their response, but I don't think I'll be ordering from this location ever again."}
{"text":"It's been a while since I have ordered from Pizza Hut. The employee who took my order over the phone did an excellent job. He was clear, concise, and was starlight to the point. 

The delivery driver did a good job. He was clear and easy to understand. The pizza wasn't bad. Good quality for the price. Thank you for a fast delivery on a last minute decision."}
{"text":"It's Pizza Hut. You always know what to expect. Fast, cheap, sometimes good and sometimes bad. 5 starz for their fast delivery service."}
{"text":"I usually order online and today I had a problem with my pizza. I called the main Pizza Hut line and was told to contact the store directly. I called several times and it took 30 minutes just to get through. When I finally spoke to someone I was given attitude saying the pizza is always like this, I had to insist that I get a new pizza. Terrible service at this location. Pizza Hut needs to streamline their online service with customer care apparently the main line has no access to the online orders which is very strange."}
{"text":"Worst Pizza I have ever had. They ruined our food and we are not the type to send anything back;however, this was unacceptable. They tried to justify how awful they made our pizza and I wasn't having it. Their customer service was horrendous. I will never go back. Absolute garbage."}
{"text":"Ghetto! The manager on duty july 1st 2018 was horrible. Delivery driver pulled up and called me to come out to his car and get my pizza, which was passed to me through his car window. Puzza was sofgy from sitting for over two hours at n his car. Only thing the manger kept saying is \"we busy\" don't order from here they are horrible ran by lazy college kids and unprofessional managers!"}
{"text":"Love Pizza Hut. Hate bad customer service. Ordered from 2600 aw Sahara location and from the way the MANAGER answered the phone ... u could tell she was having a bad day. She hifded and puffed in the phone like I was getting on her nerves and then ended the call with a \"mhmm\" *click* so I go to get the pizza and as soon as I expresssd how I was disappointed with the way I was talked to on the phone she threw my money back at me and refused to serve me. Then refused to give me corporate number and told me I had to apologize first. Needless to say my KID was standing there HUNGRY so I sucked it up. But then I still didn't get served until SANDRA finally came and gave me my now old pizza and I guess I just gotta deal with it. Cuz she was the manager as she claimed."}
{"text":"DO NOT GO HERE!!!!

This Pizza Hut cannot get the simplist pizza order correct...always the same order (majority of the time)...one large pepperoni, hut favorite crust, light sauce. Seems pretty simple huh? Not for these peeps. A few times ago we asked for extra pepperonis on the pizza and we got roughly about 10 total pepperonis...no joke. Didn't complain. This time we ask for a refund and they say ok but you have to give the pizza back and a driver will be there to pick it up in 30-45 minutes OR we can make you a new one but it about an hour wait. Wait what?!?! You messed up multiple times, in the past 5 years we have complained once and this is the way you treat loyal customers. Seems from reading previous reviews this is an ongoing problem here at this location. Heads up all, they can't read or make a pepperoni pizza correct! Will not be back to this location again and have advised many of our family, friends and neighbors to avoid this location. Oh wait and the management, they are just as bad. Must be hard to listen to the customer because they only hear what they want not what you are actually trying to explain to them!"}
{"text":"Horrible service and was told I couldn't order an appetizer because it would go in the oven at the same time my pizza would go in.  I asked if they could delay putting the pizza order in so my appetizer would come out first and the server said no.  Just unreal how they lack customer service.  I will definitely not be back ever."}
{"text":"This place is terrible. Last week we ordered a pizza and the new employee mis-informed us. I get it, you're new... but dont make us stand there for twenty minutes while someone with authority tries to make it right. When i placed my order I have him my credit card number FOUR TIMES! So the charge had gone through. The manager on duty offered me a $2 credit. Are u kidding me?!?!?! Whatever, I took it. So tonight I ordered online but called ahead to make sure they could apply my credit when I picked it up. They assured me they could.  My wife gets there and they state there is no credit. So.... again cold dinner for us and unresolved. End story.... STAY AWAY!!! GO TO PAPA JOHN'S OR PAPA MURPHY'S."}
{"text":"I'm so done with this place! I ordered 2 medium pizzas for delivery. My order was wrong and to add insult to injury, I think maybe one slice was actually covered with cheese. I called and very nicely informed the manager that my pizza was not acceptable. She sent out another and again, it was wrong and half the pizza was missing cheese! I'm so done! Why wasn't it checked before the 2nd delivery? I'm DONE with this place!"}
{"text":"Management please contact me. 

I would like to discuss how poorly staffed and supplied your Pizza Hut chain is. First, the pasta I ordered wasn't available, ok fine I settled for the meaty marinera. Then I ask for plates, oh you don't have enough, that's ok I'll use a napkin. I ask for crushed pepper... Oh you don't have that either? well that's not too bad.... Could I have fork to eat my pasta, what no forks?!?! Are you kidding, how am I suppose to eat my pasta. You could have atleast warned me before I ordered pasta. 

Now, I like pizza hut, and your staff was actually pleasant. But they looked over worked and it's distasteful that your establishment doesn't have eating utensils. I get it, sometimes you will run out of supplies... But that encounter was ridiculous. It's not possible for all of that to run out at the same time. What it really means is, management hasn't ordered the essentials needed for employees to do their jobs. 

At this point, I might as well gone to Little Caesars. Their pizza cost less than half of pizza hut and they have forks, plates and crushed pepper. 

I'm sitting here, still trying to figure out, how I'm going to eat my pasta. 

So management, pretty please get your sh*t together."}
{"text":"Been here a few times for dinner, its a type of pizza hut thats been here for a long time. The place here is a little small although the one on eglinton is way smaller. The service here is satisfactory, nothing to say about it. Everybody comes here for the pizza, but i usually come here for something else.....(can you guess???)  

The people i come here with, whether was with friends or family eat the stuffed crust pizza, my fave to order is Hawaaiin! Holla!

 BUT i mostly come here for (you guessed it!) The BBQ wings! They are Deeeelishisssss here and saucy. Side it with a caesar salad and your off! I love trying Wings everywhere and here was a definate hit! Try it and take a slice of pizza while your at it, you\"ll see why im going on and on."}
{"text":"I was in the area for work in a local hotel. I am a vegetarian. I ordered a skinny slice pizza with veggies on it. Went to open the box and eat it and inside the box was a pan pizza loaded with pepperoni and bacon. I'm literally so annoyed bc it took over an hour for delivery and was starving at this point. Make sure to check your pizza before the pizza man leaves."}
{"text":"I wanted to give them a one star for their terrible service but they comped my meal and sort of earned 3 stars instead.
I ordered online, after 30 min wait, went there to pick up, waited 15-20 mins after paying for it, only to be told that they had 1 of 2 pizzas ready and the other one not even started. They said they had to make it and it would take as much time as orders in front of mine. REALLY? Orders pending for 1 hr OR people who ordered AFTER I came into the store?
The manager was courteous and refunded  the amount and I walked out with 1 pizza to feed a hungry family instead of 2 :("}
{"text":"Cold, undercooked food.  Whoever cuts the pizza cant get it right for the second time in a row, giant pieces and tiny pieces.  Overcooked spinach and undercooked dough.  Just bake your own pizza and don't be dissatisfied."}
{"text":"Wednesday night I was craving THE HUT so the wife and I made the trek to Don Mills and Finch for some well deserved, artery clogging, greasy pizza.  I have had enough eating home cooked meals.

When we arrived a nice host guided us to our table.  It was dead quiet inside, only a few families were seated.  Angie was our server and we ordered our absolute favourite pizza, Large Pan Supreme Lover's with Extra Tomato Sauce.  She brought it to us within 10 minutes.  It was piping hot and super fresh and looked tremendously delicious.  I can never have Pizza Hut take out as it ruins it's crispness while enclosed in the box!  

The pizza was truly amazing, however, I would have given this place 5 stars if the pizza had that extra tomato sauce as it honestly was a bit lacking.

The nice host relieved Angie of her duties and billed us out.  He was attentive to us.

Most definitely would return in the future and stress the extra tomato sauce motion."}
{"text":"I hate this location so much the manager susan was the worst person i have ever met. Accused me of trying to rip her off when i asked for ranch sauce for my wings. This location is a joke i opened a yelp account just to leave this review"}
{"text":"We always get fresh hot pizza from this location. The service is good, people are friendly and they have great prices."}
{"text":"We live near this location.  The actual pizza isn't bad.  When you get what you ordered.  My husband ordered a stuffed crust with olives, onions, and jalapeños.  We are looking at a stuffed crust pepperoni.  A cold, 45 minute old pizza.  We will never go back.  We will travel 15 miles to go get a decent pizza.  This establishment has had so many bad reviews.  I don't know how they stay in business.  Will never step foot in there again."}
{"text":"The worst of the corporate pizza delivery chains in the neighborhood. I tried them for the first time in months just to see if they were any better and they are not. I stopped using them when I had several bad deliveries in a row in 2015, a few of them taking over 2 hours, and the food kept getting worse and worse. When they sent me a free pizza to make up for all the bad deliveries, THAT delivery person tried to charge me, took my pizza back to the car and called the manager before she'd give me the pizza. Then the guy the other day couldn't read the unit number on my pizza receipt, so instead of calling back to work or calling me to verify the unit number, he took it to the wrong unit. By the time I received it, it was cold. I'd say the last 10 pizzas I got from this place were late and cold. Obviously the manager doesn't have a clue how to run a delivery business. Then when I ate the pizza it was like a sodium bomb compared to the other two major pizza delivery corporations. Ordering from this Pizza Hut will really suck the life out of you. No more Pizza Hut for me... ever."}
{"text":"Ordered on the mobile app, and the pizza arrived, lukewarm, 37 minutes after the estimated time (1 hour 47 minutes total).  Tried to call to check up on the order, no one picked up (twice).  Seasoning I ordered on the crust was not present.  Delivery guy was courteous, first thing he said was to apologize for taking so long; he got a tip.  At this point, especially after reading the other reviews, I'm blaming management.

I've received much quicker delivery from the store at 10420 W Cheyenne when I order at a friend's house, and that Pizza Hut will continue to get my business.  The only reason I ordered Pizza Hut at home tonight, rather than Rosati's, was the convenience of the mobile app.  Next time I'll call Rosati's, where someone will actually answer the phone, and have a better pizza delivered hot and prompt."}
{"text":"Since I just choke-slammed another Pizza Hut location through a table in a review here, I thought I should give this store a shout-out for being the opposite of what I reviewed earlier.  Every time I've ordered on the mobile app from a friend's house in NW Las Vegas, the pizzas come hot and fast.  I have yet to have a problem with this Pizza Hut location; keep up the great work."}
{"text":"Ordered a Pizza and waited for 2 hours. Pizza didn't arrive so we canceled the order. 
After another 30 minutes, pizza come, and we told the delivery person we canceled it so he brought the pizza back.

Guess what, they still charged us. I called 4 times, and each time their response is to ask me to wait, they cannot issue the refund to me in their system because they need to contact with the head office of Pizza HUT.

A month passed, no refund. Stay away, this place is ridiculous. 

Updated: I got my money back by calling my credit card company...."}
{"text":"Pizza was never delivered. Called 2x before was told that order was cancelled. Delivery driver reported that he knocked and called but no one answered - this is not true. Manager was an asshole and offered to have it redelivered but would take another 45 minutes and there was nothing that he could do. 
So if you want your pizza delivered in 3-5 hours, this is your spot."}
{"text":"Haven't been to pizza hut in a few yrs. My daughter and I wanted to try the bacon crust pizza one day a few wks ago so I ordered online  (ok that wasn't successful so I had to call) anyway I placed my order and 5 mins later they called and said they ran out of the bacon crust. This was at noon. Wasn't very happy. Needless to say I don't think I'll be attempting this again any time soon"}
{"text":"I've been a long time customer online for this Pizza Hut on Desert Inn  in Las Vegas.

 Finding out they cancelled my order after almost 2 hours of waiting...????

This is what happened: I made another order for work and waited for over an hour. I call over to the store and they say I came up as a \"new customer\" and called my HOME phone in which nobody answered and so they cancelled the order. I asked them if I was getting the money back into my account and they told me it would take up to 5 business days and the order stays cancelled. I ask if he would just order it for me in which he does but not with the 20% discount advertised for the online order. He said it was no fault of theirs but I would be out the money for the last order, pay again over the phone and then could NOT get the 20% off I was originally trying to get. WHAT A RIP OFF!!!!

Pizza came way late and delivery guy waited for a tip. I told him it was on my account and Pizza hut is holding it for 5 days."}
{"text":"First time doing a carry out order and Ronnin was awesome! He price shopped for me and offered to upgrade my pizza for less... I'm always happy when someone is looking out for my wallet, especially without being asked. He was friendly personable and caring enough to bring it to my attention. I must also point out that thanks to his perfected phone greeting I didn't have to ensure I was calling the right location I already knew... I mention this because two seconds prior I had called the wrong location and was rudely told yes wrong place and hung up on... though I still love Pizza Hut and will continue to buy this level customer service will keep me coming back to this one. Ps the entire night crew looked alive and happy to be here"}
{"text":"I've been getting delivery from this restaurant for as long as I've lived at my current apartment in Mesa, AZ (over a year) and I've really loved the food and the delivery driver's service.  Tonight stood out for me, though.  I've been having a really bad week, so I decided to order a pizza this evening so I wouldn't have to bother making dinner.  When the delivery driver showed up, she was just a ball of sunshine.  So friendly and smiling.  (Plus, I was delighted to see a girl doing this job, as I myself have been a girl delivery driver for many years, so I have a deep respect for girls who do it.)  Her smile and genuine friendliness made my day 100% better.  Thanks for making my day, and delivering the best thin crust pizza, ever!"}
{"text":"Placed an order on the phone from Los Angeles for a large pepperoni pizza, breadsticks, and boneless BBQ wings.  Spoke to the GM Lou who worked with me to send a special order to our friends in Ravenna who just had a baby boy on Tuesday.  He took the order and CC and also took a tip on the phone so our friends wouldn't be bothered.  Made an additional request for a special message and he came through.  Thank you Lou and thanks Pizza Hut for making a special meal for the tired new parents.  You guys rock!"}
{"text":"Because I do not get to eat this kind of food everyday because I live a healthy lifestyle LOL and because I can never seem to use my coupons online because I don't know why but they honor them when I call over the phone and place my order because there's Pizza Hut was always great again for seven and a half years I have been over here"}
{"text":"I haven't dined at a Pizza Hut in a very long time and I think it will be my last time. We were greeted promptly at the entrance and seated fairly fast. There were about 5 other tables occupied in the restaurant. 

After deciding what to order, we waited patiently but didn't see our server in sight; mind you the place isn't very large. After waiting for unreasonable amount of time, we ordered a medium stuffed crust pizza and two pints of beer. The food arrived fairly fast and it was at best mediocre, we were not impressed. Our server did not come by to check on our meal until the very end when we had finished our food. We got the bill and left pretty quickly after doing so. 

I noticed the table next to ours had to get up to inform someone they had not been approached. Overall, a fairly disappointing experience and to add onto it the place is starting to look rundown and washrooms weren't very clean. I would not recommend this place."}
{"text":"Definitely one of the WORST restaurants I have ever been to. OK so I came for the lunch buffet. The food was cold and dry and no new food came out for 15 minutes. The floor was dirty and our table was dirty with pizza sauce on it. When my drink was served to me there were particles floating around in it. There was a waiter of Asian descent working that day that was picking up food from the floor with his bare hands in front of customers, VERY BIG TURN OFF! Not the best customer service skills either. They seemed very understaffed. Further more that location is very old and dated. Like when they changed the pizza hut logo it would have only made sense to updated the interior of the restaurants too. It looks likes its still stuck in the 70's. Booths were dirty and had visible sweat marks on them. This location can do much better overall with its service and presentation. The staff could be more diverse and professional."}
{"text":"Ive always had a really good experience with PH on flamingo , this time Amanda answered the phone and instead of rushing through she took time to ask me how I was doing , I know its small but it means a lot. I also know that the majority of the calls are delivery and you have to be quick, but it was a pleasant surprise. Thanks Amanda!"}
{"text":"I usually like Pizza Hut, but every time I have ordered food from this location, the pizza has been burned and the wings undercooked... How does that work?!  I finally gave up and stopped ordering from there all together!  I go to Dominos! Great Pizza at Dominos!!!"}
{"text":"Forgets marinara with cheesy bread, hardly cheese on cheesy bread, no crust flavor ever and the one time I got it it was the wrong one. Just poor service all the way around. I order pizza a lot and gave them too many chances already so I'm done now."}
{"text":"I am not a fan of Pizza Hut but people I was with could not wait, so I did have any choice. 
We walked-in, and had to wait around for 10 minutes to order our food. We had to find clean table so we could sit. 

It took them 30 minutes to bring our orders. and waiter brought our foods he was very nice guy but he was wearing dirty shirt. I could not stop laughing. I asked for Veggie Lover with Mushrooms, green pepper, red onion, ripe tomato and pizza mozzarella I had much better pizza. 
My wife had Chicken Lover's with Grilled chicken breast, green pepper, red onion, mushrooms and pizza mozzarella it was okay recording to her."}
{"text":"Order for delivery for the first time yesterday. Thought I'd switch up from the usual Papa Johns. I ordered online and was quotes 45 minutes for delivery. I thought it seemed kinda long, but figure whatever. My pizza finally arrive after and hour and 10 minutes. The pizza cold and I had to reheat in the oven before I could eat. The only reason I'm not giving just 1 star is because one the pizza was hot it was fairly decent tasting. However I will never order pizza from here again."}
{"text":"Well there goes  your good review from me ! 
I ordered pizza and wings today and now waiting over 50 min to get the food delivered !?? Spoke with the manager Tara . And well she's rude and absolutely no help she has horrible customer service I would highly recommend going somewhere else ! 
It's fake pizza  this shouldn't take you an hour to deliver ! 
She offered a 5 dollar credit on my account after I spent over $30 
What a shame guess we won't be coming back here any more !"}
{"text":"Its fast food pizza not a lot of expectations. We got our food delivered. We even got someone elses pizza. These guys has the seeds to call and leave a message to call back. If it was about the pizza you weren't getting it back. No way do you take a pizza from one house to another because you messed up. Hopefully the other guy got his free. We didn't need the extra pizza so we gave it to a homeless guy. So meh I've experienced better. Its called non chain pizza places that you pay an extra couple bucks for and get quality not tomato paste on cardboard."}
{"text":"I orderd large veg pizza and personal chicken pizza. Both pizzas were tasty. Customer service was top notch.sequoia was so helpful. i will b goin back very soon"}
{"text":"After ordering from the pizza hut 2 blocks from me and them telling me they're out of dough I had to come here. Seriously pizza hut on Flamingo, out of dough?! And not even a phone call! Balls!

Anyway, the lady here was nice; a little weird but nice. The pizza was ok, nothing orgasmic. So yea."}
{"text":"Well, well, well... Pizza Hut. So my bf and I went around looking for a PH buffet. We went to one in BF Egypt to no avail and asked them... of course they didnt know so we took a chance and called this little gem. SUCCESS!

5.99 Lunch buffet, YES PLEASE! I used to live in Colorado and had one right by the house; cheapest and best pizza buffet imo. Of course as soon as they bring out new pizzas the people flock to it like vultures on a dead cow. But I love that they have cinna stix. The server was Meh, but the little beaner one we had the next time was suave. I'm a beaner fyi so I could say that... lol. She was awesome, the first one asked how old my 5yr old was and said she would have to charge him full price and I was like wtf?! He ate 1 slice of pizza!! (my son hardly eats, hes a skinny mini!!) but this next one didnt ask and didnt charge! My kinda woman!

Anyway, pizza here is good... salad is ok, and the service is meh if you get the good ONE. Also, seems like they always only have 1 waitress there; so I always tip a little better... unless she tries to charge me full price for the mini!"}
{"text":"Horrible! Ordered a large pizza and a cheese stick from them. Both were delivered completely burnt. Called them just to be told that they could not locate the order. Called up again after checking the confirmation mail. This time they could locate the order. After deliberation agreed to deliver new. Still waiting to get it. I would never order from here and would advice people to stay away!"}
{"text":"Terrible!!! 2nd time we have ordered from this location. Wait over an hour both times and we live less than 5 min away. Main thing is taste is disgusting. Taste just like store bought digiorno. Hard crust. Way more crust than cheese and just no flavor!!!!  Going back to dominoes &/or papa johns"}
{"text":"did not like it at all, i order some pizza for me and my coworker, they deliver and hour later and is just 5 min away from my job, i told them to go through the employee entrance and they went through the main entrance. and the food was deliver cold like it was made 3 hrs ago"}
{"text":"If I could give a big fat ZERO star I would! 
I dined here with my family and it was the worst experience ever. When seated my family and I weren't greeted for 10 minuets. Our server thought it was more important to clean the table next to us than to greet us. The server didn't even introduce herself. I didn't know her name and she didn't tell us about any specials that Pizza Hut was offering. I could tell from that moment that this wasn't going to be a great experience. If it wasn't for my family I would have left at that point ... you don't deserve my money when you can't even offer good customer service. When the food arrived we were eating a Caesar salad and noticed at the bottom of the salad that there was a long blonde hair and I immediately freaked out and almost threw up my food it was disgusting. When I brought this to the attention of the server there was no apology she just simply took the salad away and brought over a new one. I told her that I didn't want a new salad and to bring over the manager. You would think the manager would have some sort of professionalism but was I ever so wrong, there was no apology from the manager as well which was odd because if your manager you should want your guest to have the best dining experience. The manager didn't even offer to take the salad off the bill. She simply said \"I will give you 25% off\". Overall I will never be dining at this Pizza Hut/ ordering from Pizza Hut ever again. And I will be sharing the story with all my fellow coworkers, family and friends shame on you Pizza Hut  for having staff that don't care about quality and your customers satisfaction."}
{"text":"My husband ordered pizza and wings from this location and I am extremely displeased. I opened up the wings which smelled delicious, only to find that they are undercooked. What a disappointment. It's unfortunate that people can't properly prepare food before they serve it to paying customers. Would not recommend purchasing wings from here. Or perhaps order  prior to evening shift when there might be a different employee operating the chicken wing department."}
{"text":"On vacation, staying at the Wyndham. Ordered online due to plane being delayed and getting in late. Order took over an hour to be delivered. We ordered the Pizza Hut Box and the order was incorrect, cold, and was not fresh. So disappointed. It was disgusting. Avoid ordering from this location at all costs."}
{"text":"Horrible service. Stuck here in Charlotte because weather caused me to miss my connecting flight. My hotel recommended this place for delivery and I wish they didn't. 

I placed an order at 9:40pm. They wait until 11:30pm to call and tell me that their drivers car broke down and they will be unable to deliver our dinner. What kind of chain pizza delivery place has only one driver? Now I'm stuck in my room with no dinner and everyone else is closed. 

Stay away from this place, worst customer service I've ever experienced."}
{"text":"We got a medium pizza with four toppings last night and it was very disappointing. There was very little sauce and not a lot of toppings,
plus the crust was thin (didn't order thin crust) and the cheese 
was bland. Maybe during their 50% off special they don't try that hard.
Won't go their again. Do yourself a favor and go across the street
to Bellacinos, excellent pizza but a little pricey."}
{"text":"This place is great when it's good. Service polite. 
Deals everywhere 
But when the sun goes down .... it's a crap Shot and they seem to enjoy shooting snake eyes for the customer. 

Tuesday, I placed my order online for 9:30p pick up at 6:00pm. I arrive at 928p and sat in the car. Walked in and had to wait ... no worries. 
Got to the counter, paid (because you can't online) 

then proceeded to wait 18 minutes without warning nor apology for a personal size pan. 

I'm over it but I resolved to complete the pizza Hut survey with the hope that things may improve. We Shall See. 

Why did I order in advance?"}
{"text":"This is a chain...what can I say?

Well this location is new. The building is new. offers a WING STREET (I remember when Madison Pizza Hut's had no concept of this so it's a great addition). 

PH fulfills the need of a deep, greasy, pan pizza for cheap when the urge hits. I think they have beef toppings now. I never understood why they didn't. 

Easy in and out location including biking/walking or driving. Has an outlet in the lobby to charge your piece of technology while you wait."}
{"text":"This is the second time this has happened ... A fucked up pizza .. I ordered a cheese pizza add jalepenos bell peppers mushrooms and drizzle honey siracha on the pizza .. They sent me a pizza with no sauce on it just honey siracha ... I called to complain whoever answered said she made the pizza her self and it was light sauce ... I'm staring at the pizza and telling her there is no sauce and she continues to talk over me ,, I finally cut her off like what is a pizza with no pizza sauce ma'am .. She send me another pizza ... The box was very heavy so I look at it and this time the whole damn jar of siracha is on the damn pizza .. And U guys about to close man that's fucked up and I should come smack the entire shut OUTTA all YALL"}
{"text":"Worst Pizza Hut ever... Pizza was delivered cold and dry .... Called and they said they are sending another... 1.5 hours later... no pizza ... Will never order from here again! Order dominos, it's a much safer option."}
{"text":"Five stars for great customer service! My son received  a coupon for a free personal pizza from school. For some odd reason the store didn't have personal pans available so upgraded us to a medium pizza. Nice that someone took the time to talk to the manager and was able to accommodate us."}
{"text":"This Pizza hut does not very good reviews and that's probably because their not as fast as they would like to be. Whatever time they give you to show up, you must always have to wait an extra 5 minutes to get your pizza's. The delivery service is always a little bit late as well but the pizzas are always fantastic and made exactly the way that I ordered them so 4 stars for this pizza hut. 

Recently they've been having the two medium pizzas special for 6.99 each. I like this because I can get two different types of pizza and I don't get too much so I won't end up overeating or wasting it. 

This pizza Hut is located in the shopping center on Bermuda and windmill right next to the Vons Supermarket. It's very tricky to see from the road cuz it's tucked away in between Wells Fargo and Vons supermarket so keep your eye out if you're carrying out."}
{"text":"Overall: Normal Pizza Hut with decent service.  They don't allow online coupons via phone.

Food: 3 stars.  I've always liked the pan pizzas.  They do a good job of rolling out new varieties.  The pretzel crust is very good.  Bread sticks are weak.  Wings are very small, but have good sauces.

Prices: 3 stars. There are good deals online.  When I call via phone, they sometimes don't let me use the online coupons, which is a pain if I'm not in front of a computer.

Service: 3 stars.  I've only gotten carry-out.   The front desk people are usually nice enough.

Appearance: 2 stars.  Typical old looking Pizza Hut interior.  They really need a refreshed look."}
{"text":"Why do I have to wait 20 min to get my order taken then another 1hr for it to be ready ya need to fix this shit"}
{"text":"I've ordered from this location many of times and always enjoyed my experience. However the past few times have been far less than satisfactory., but this time takes the cake.  The food shows up at the house and my soda was forgotten  when I asked about it the driver said I guess I can go back and get it if you want. What do you want me to do? I wish I could provide that type of customer service at my place of employment. I finally just got frustrated and told him to credit it to my bill. Doubtful it will actually happened. So I sit down to at least enjoy my food, sadly that didn't happen either. My chicken was over cooked so much so it hurt my teeth and my nacho fries were completely soggy on the bottom and not very impressing at all. On a almost 30$ bill I expected so much more. This locationhas completely lost mine and my famlies business. I willbe going else where for my easy dinners from now on. Very sad indeed."}
{"text":"Tonight I ordered the 2 medium pizza deal (custom pizzas) and a side of Cajun fries. ... 2 reason for the 2 stars ... 
#1 fries were extremely stale!!! We couldn't eat it so we just tossed it in the trash.. 
#2 the 2 pizzas were great but ONE OF THE PIZZAS was NOT SLICED! It's a good thing we brought the pizza home because if we took it somewhere where a knife or a slicer wasn't available we wouldn't been SOL."}
{"text":"Nice quick place to take the kids for pizza for a good time.. They also have a salad bar if ur tryn to watch ur weight lol.."}
{"text":"A Good Pizza Hut. Boneless wings were very good and saucy. Pan pizza was what you expect from Pizza Hut.  Good location right by the highway."}
{"text":"I haven't always been a Pizza Hut girl, but starting to become a regular due to Cheesy Bites pizza addiction. The Hershey's brownie is amazing as well! Add that to friendly, accommodating staff and you have yourself a neighborhood winner!"}
{"text":"OMG! What crappy customer service! Our order was wrong and I told the delivery guy...after we tipped him and he said, \"Oh well, call our customer service.\"
We've ordered here before and EVERY TIME THEY MESS UP OR ORDER AND DONT CARE! We said we would never order from here again, but we stupidly did. NEVER AGAIN! I want my money back too!"}
{"text":"This Pizza Hut has the worst service of any metro Phoenix Pizza Hut.  The pizza is good.   The delivery drivers are nice.  The \"order takers\" or front desk people have zero customer service.  They are rude and supercilious."}
{"text":"They cool sometime s when there on time and get your toppings right or when they tell you straight out we don't deliver there no more..."}
{"text":"While I love Pizza Hut for their pizza (obviously) and boneless wings, this location BY FAR, has the slowest possible delivery I have ever experienced.  Mind you we live no more than a couple of miles away from this location and we have never waited less than an hour and ten minutes for our order.  I guess we're going to have to make our own wings now and go with another chain, this is getting really old...waiting, and waiting, oh wait...still waiting...an hour and 20 minutes later and counting. Well it finally arrived, wings barely sauced and pizza lukewarm.  Total bummer!"}
{"text":"If I could give no stars I would... 
After an hour and 20 min of waiting for our pizza I decided to call their number well it turns out it's the call center not the store! So after trying to understand what the heck the person was saying on the other end of the line I asked for them to cancel my order. 10 min later I'm connected to the store. I ask for a refund the manager tell me it was on its way it left 4 min ago. I live off of carefree highway! So I said that he looks at my Adress and says fine you don't have to pay. Thanks 
When the pizza arrives I have to bake it in my oven because it is still raw!!!! Needless to say I will order dominos off of daisy mountain rd and still get it in the third of the time it took to get my pizza and bake it too."}
{"text":"I called and places an order over an hour ago from 2.5 miles away and my pizza has not arrived they told me it would be here by 7:30 and it is not 8:15 and still no pizza... I would NOT order pizza from here I even called 20 min ago and they said it was on the way"}
{"text":"Order pick up no sauce not and even pie with toppings slim and Just in one place
Will have to rethink ordering again"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying this: I used to LOVE Pizza Hut. And at times, all I want is their garlic/stuffed crust because dominos does not have this like PH does. I ordered a large pizza online and within 30 minutes, it was at my doorstep. Freaky fast! The pizza was still hot which was great! The delivery guy was very nice too. I opened up the box and a feeling of nostalgia rushed over me because I used to eat this as a kid. I got a garlic stuffed crust with pepp and meatballs. The crust was AMAZING, but I ended up taking the meatballs off...not as tasty as I had hoped, but not really a big deal to me...So as I'm eating the crust, making my way to the pizza itself, I noticed there was little to NO dough on the actual pizza! Now don't get me wrong, I know that PH is known for making their crusts a little thin, but this was not acceptable. The dough was so thin, pretty much non existent, SOGGY and inedible. I ended up taking all the pepperonis off, putting them on the stuffed crust, and throwing the actual pizza in the trash. Yes, it was THAT bad. I give the garlic stuffed crust 5 stars...but the quality of the pies at PH have diminished and sadly I won't be back"}
{"text":"Update...Still haven't received my refund, so basically they stole my money and lied to me that I'd get it in 10 business days...and it's been way longer than 10 business days. I'm not surprised but I was still hopeful I would get my money back for such poor delivery service, especially since the owner reached out to me on Yelp. I will never go back to this Pizza hut."}
{"text":"+.5 for service

It's awesome that a Pizza Hut finally opened in the east end of Markham, because I've heard negative stories about the branch across from Markville. I don't eat pizza a lot, but when I do it's usually Pizza Hut, and I had the privilege of ordering from this branch recently.

Pizza Hut recently started an online ordering menu, so I decided to take advantage of it and pick up at the branch. They had a promotion going on, which was $32.99 for two medium pizzas, 2 dips, 14 boneless bites, and a 2L bottle of pop, so I decided to go with that.

Service at the counter was efficient, they had my order ready on time, although I had to change one of my sauces as they didn't have that available. Instead of one of the BBQ sauces, I switched to mild buffalo sauce, a decision I later regretted.

The pizzas I ordered were supreme lovers and chicken lovers. Both of them tasted very good, exactly what I expected from Pizza Hut. The boneless bites itself were okay, but the buffalo sauce was incredibly sour...didn't taste anything like buffalo sauce. I went without the sauce in the end.

I'll likely return here if I were to order pizza, but will definitely not order the buffalo sauce again."}
{"text":"Pretty disappointed in this Pizza Hut location. First, I should have just picked it up, considering it is two blocks away from my house, and there must have been a huge delivery charge due to the fact that one stuffed crust pizza with 1 1/2 toppings and one small order of wings was $28... Anyway, we asked for the pizza to be uncut and par baked so that we could bake it to our liking once it arrived an hour and a half later, but they couldn't even do that for us because it came almost fully baked and cut (now how are we supposed to put it in the oven?). Also, they failed to give us our blue cheese dressing for our wings. Also this is Monday at 11am when they opened, so I'm not sure how it took that long to prepare ESPECIALLY since they weren't even supposed to cook it all the way. Shitty."}
{"text":"Great little neighborhood Pizza Hut. I'm not usually a fan of \"chain pizza\" but this location is always delivered fast, hot and really good! I hate paying $40-50 for a couple of delivery pizzas from some of the other local places, but Pizza Hut's 2 mediums for 5.99 special is great!"}
{"text":"I inadvertently ordered my pizza to this location, since it turns out to be closer than the one near Markville. I find this location seems to make better pizza than that one, and plus it's far more consistent.

I love ordering those $10 deals!"}
{"text":"I feel like all Pizza Huts are pretty consistent in terms of quality of pizza (which isn't surprising). I write because every time I come here, the employees are always so nice and inviting. I keep coming back to this location specifically because I know that they are always so professional, helpful, and amazing."}
{"text":"WORST PIZZA PLACE EVER said order would take 30 minutes took a hour pizza was old and cold few frys that came in order were soggy chicken gross from i guess sitting in plastic so long before got it driver said had big $200 order before bringing our food guess thats why ours sat around so long well with tip i spent $36 for food couldn't eat and pissed off great job managing your restaurant"}
{"text":"Pizza is my favorite place to get pizza. Any other place isn't as good. Pizza huts pizza has soft bread and a gooey crust that is sweet and breaks perfectly in your mouth when you take a bite. There pizza isn't dripping in grease unlike other pizza places. There toppings are evenly spread around the pizza with the exemplary amount and the sauce is never too little or too much. So the cost may a little much but it's definitely worth every penny."}
{"text":"I thought the location move would help this pizza hut.  I was wrong it takes an hour and 30 min to get food and its cold. How does it stay open?"}
{"text":"Ordered a pizza for pick-up, paid 12.49 when it's normally 9.99 ordering online (they wouldn't honor it). The pizza was smashed up and falling apart when I got it, with what looked like 2 types of crusts. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"Anthony, Brooke and the rest of the Team do a excellent job providing awesome customer service and food! We are all not perfect but on a journey to be our best! Thanks for everything!"}
{"text":"This is the worst pizza location ever!! And I mean it. I'm a Pizza Hut lover but this location makes me hate Pizza Hut! They never pick up the phone...put customers on hold for 15-30 mins while they are just chatting with each other. I have bad experience with them for three times. Never going there again!"}
{"text":"They were fairly quick with the delivery, but when we opened it up the pizza was folded in half,  we aren't usually ones to complain, but then we found a long black hair in the pizza.. the quality was terrible, wouldn't recommend ordering from this location."}
{"text":"What can I say, it's your typical Pizza Hut. Consistently mediocre pizza. Delivery came in the expected time though so that was a plus."}
{"text":"If you order online within 55 minutes of their closing time they call you and tell you everything on your order they \"ran out of\". Once sure...twice I highly doubt. It's not like we ordered 5 mins from closing. 
They stink!"}
{"text":"This might have been the most inconvenient, unpleasant pizza experience ever. They card ed D me to pay debit (forgot my ID At home). I thought the purpose of paying DEBIT is to pay with your secure PIN so you're not inconvenienced by having to take your ID everywhere? On top of that, they got my order wrong and then it was delayed.  Go to domino's across the street and pretend this place never ever existed."}
{"text":"New employee made a mistake. It happens to all of us. When I called back to make them aware of the problem Kevin and the delivery driver made everything ok! The quality was great and the students of ITT Tech will continue to order from our local Pizza Hut. Thank you from Tracy!"}
{"text":"Worst delivery. I've ordered online and had this location  mutiple time. Always late ! Every time is has been on the average 30 minutes late!! Always cold !! They should hire more drivers !"}
{"text":"The Pizza Hut here is great with carry out and will get your order right overall. They're very nice overall. Warning though, the deals online are not always honored if you call in. For example, they don't have the advertised $10 any toppings large pizza deal (they only offer an $11 large pizza up to 3 toppings). All in all, the Pizza was made with a decent amount of toppings, and the thin crust won't be burnt. It's just not the best pizza you'll have."}
{"text":"Pizza and wings are always great here. Delivery is prompt and all staff I've dealt with have been polite and happy. The one time a mistake was made they fixed it and then some with no problem. Great staff great pizza great great wings great for the family!"}
{"text":"Pizza Hut has always been a classic in my opinion. This location is a nice little place next to Bookman's and Goodwill. Ya Ma would love this place."}
{"text":"Its is your typical Pizza Hut pizza. This location is a carry out/delivery only. The carry out deals are great, amd since this is close to home, we take advantage of those. I found that the delivery drivers havr no personality; they have forgotten to deliver things I've ordered like soda or my side of bread sticks, amd I never get my ranch or blue cheese when they deliver wings. Overall..wings are good, pizza is typical,  and they have good deals."}
{"text":"I wa s craving the creamy Italian dressing dound in the pizza hut salad bar, so dine-in it was! Our sever was very friendly and efficient.  The salad bar was ok...lettuce could have been a little more fresh, but the cucumber,  carrots, and other veggies were fresh and I love the creamy Italian dressing (yes I know its bad for you and defeats the purpose of a healthy salad but it is so yummy)!  Our waitress offered the $10 pizza deal to us, but a large pizza is too much for two people and the medium pizza was cheaper so we went with that. The pizza was actually super greasy...I had to do dreaded napkin blotting in order to enjoy it. All in all, not a bad experience."}
{"text":"Placed an order at 7. It said it was on its way at 8:30. It's now 11 and it hasn't come yet. Don't answer the phone. Last time I ordered they said they had no drivers and I didn't receive a refund."}
{"text":"Got the new bacon and cheese stuffed crust, yumm it's pretty delicious! If you order online you can get an order of breadsticks or 2 liter of soda for free. Ordered delivery and got the pizza within 30 minutes, so it was really quick!"}
{"text":"Ok...so this is Pizza Hut. You kind of know what to expect. But my boyfriend and I came in to get a quick slice/we had to get a pie and it was very pleasant. I had to go to the bathroom sooo bad and the really nice woman behind the counter let me go in their employee bathroom way behind the kitchen. This was far beyond what they are expected to do and she told me that which I understood, so I respected that. They were very kind to let me in an area that was not open to customers without any issue. Not only that, but they gave us a super deal on 2 pizzas, breadsticks, and wings!!! I can't wait to come back on a super fat/drunk night again!!!!"}
{"text":"You literally have a fifty fifty shot with this location. My guess is depending on who is working. I actually like Pizza Hut on occasion, but you never know what you are going to get from here. Half of the time it is burnt and awful and half of the time it is perfect. If I feel like gambling for something cheap to eat, this is where I go."}
{"text":"This is just like all of the other Pizza Huts in the area, reasonable food at a reasonable costs.

Delivery is consistent and always seems to be hot.  I have become a big fan of the wings, and especially the Wed Night Wing deals.

This is a carry out only / delivery location, but does have a few benches to sit on while you wait.

{"text":"Order two medium pizza's they were delivered earlier than promised delicious and piping hot very pleased!"}
{"text":"First off have to say the first thing we noticed was how clean the place was compared to some of the Pizza Huts you go too. Very impressed with our server Jeremiah, he was very nice, polite and courteous. We ordered Meat Lovers Pizza and breadsticks and they came out very hot and good was delicious! Would definitely recommend this Pizza Hut especially if you get Jeremiah as your server!"}
{"text":"Horrible place, when the waitress Shelly asked if we were eating there as she walked us to our table she commented \"oh good, maybe I'll get a tip\" 
Really??? Than we give her our order which was a medium hand tossed meat lovers pizza she says \" so just a cheese pizza and what size was that?! I just told you seconds ago what we wanted. As we're waiting for our pizza another couple had to walk up to the counter for their check and had to yell a couple times for help! We get our pizza and the crust is so thin and barely cooked. We asked for a take home box for the other half of the pizza and she gives us a bread stick box. When we went up to pay she just tells me an amount and I said could I see the bill, and she's like oh, I forgot it's in back. We told her how thin the pizza is and she said to us oh well the pan is really thick?! What's that have to do with anything. Would not recommend this location"}
{"text":"Well, let's be real, it's Pizza Hut. Lol. Which isn't bad as Pizza Hut has a consistent flavor profile that can be found all over the world.

The environment is a modern departure from the red hat shaped buildings of the 90's, which I sorta miss. The salad bar. The buffet. The fun small arcade with games like Beast Master and Ninja Turtles. But, I digress.

This new environment reminds me of the bar section at a Buffalo Wild Wings. Again, which isn't bad, just not something unique to Pizza Hut.

The food came out fast and the staff was friendly. The wooden chairs and table tops are modern and the beer selection small (ShockTop, BudLight, KiltLifter are the only beers on tap). 

Overall, if you're feeling in the mood for sitting down at a Pizza Hut, not sure why one would, since there's no buffet, it's a safe clean place to grab a slice of pizza for lunch. 

Salud!"}
{"text":"The staff here are always super nice and the food is always fresh and hot. I love going to there for the pizza bar during lunch but often get a personal pan pizza and pick it up through their convenient drive thru. This is my favorite pizza hut."}
{"text":"Takes twice as long to get delivered compared to estimate. Not sure why I order from here anymore."}
{"text":"The pizza was good,  customer service was fine. I had an issue with the pre-made, soggy, partially browned Caesar salad. It tasted a little tart, in fact. The selection for the buffet was adequate. I wasn't blown over on the freshness of the fare, but, as long as the salad doesn't get me sick, I'd probably come back."}
{"text":"I waited 1 hour and 45 minutes for my pizza to be delivered. Then when I got it, it was cold! I was so hungry but refused to eat that stuff!"}
{"text":"Great experience, the girl gave me a coupon price of $7.99 for a large two topping even though I couldn't find the code online, food was also fresh and great."}
{"text":"WORST pizza I've eaten in past 30+ years. Bland tomato (marinara) and pie crust. Pizza is my favorite food but this one was so bad, I threw 3/4 of it in the trash rather than subject my taste buds to further disappointment. I've had 99 cent frozen supermarket pizzas with more flavor."}
{"text":"I got a large pepperoni pizza from here today. It was disgusting. It was the most bland pizza I've ever had. Most of your employees were clueless when I picked up my order, they were having so many issues. Overall this decided for me that I will always choose papa johns over Pizza Hut no matter what. Little Caesars even put this place to shame. Sorry Pizza Hut never again."}
{"text":"Place sucks. We went online and ordered a pizza and wings (nothing crazy, just a pizza and wings. We didn't ask them to make a smiley face out of pepperoni or anything like that. They've had lots of practice making both of these items I'm sure) and the estimated delivery time was 65 minutes. 65 minutes is a long time when you're hungry, I honestly didn't know if I had the patience or wherewithal to make it. I decided I needed a way out, so I said \"Hey, I bet they're pretty backed up with deliveries tonight. Let's help alleviate this issue and just call them and ask to pick it up. That'd be nice of us, they'll like that\". We call about 10 minutes after ordering and the guy on the phone said that the food would be ready in 10 minutes at 7:05ish. Good, great, awesome, see you soon Pizza Hut man. 

We decided to wait an extra 10 minutes and show up at 7:15 just to be safe because everyone knows that there's nothing worse than sitting in the undersized waiting area of a pizza place like a weirdo just twiddling your thumbs and staring at the fridge full of unclaimed 2 liters. We get all checked out by about 7:20 and the guy at the front counter lets us know that \"it's almost done\". What do you mean it's almost done? We've now given you an extra 15 minutes Pizza Hut man, you're not holding up your end of the deal. We take a seat in the waiting room for what could've been weeks or months or even years I really couldn't tell. Time passes exponentially slower inside a Pizza Hut, it's essentially a black hole within a strip mall. 

They eventually realize that there is no way they've been cooking our pizza for 40 minutes, ask us for the name on the order, and start looking through the orders that were sitting there waiting to be claimed. Ours is nowhere to be found, it's MIA, another casualty of the proverbial pizza war. My friend then gets someones attention, points to one looking lonely in the corner and says \"Hey, is that ours?\". Pizza Hut man confirms that it is indeed our pizza, we retrieve the package and promptly exit the Pizza Hut. We successfully get the food home, this is the moment we've been waiting exactly 56 minutes for. WELP, the food is cold and it's honestly hard to tell if I'm eating the pizza or the cardboard box at this point. The wings are also cold and just generally not good, the skin on the outside has a distinct jerky-like texture and is more  akin to a buffalo flavored piece of gum than a chicken wing. To add insult to injury, this lackluster ensemble was $30.00 American.

I'm not upset, I'm just extremely disappointed. From now on my pizza business will be going to Papa John and his boy Peyton Manning."}
{"text":"Ordered online and it promised I could pick up my order in 15-20 minutes, 30 minutes later I'm still waiting.  Finally got the pizza but the manager was nice enough to give me a free 2 liter because they were late.  Pizza is good for store front pizza"}
{"text":"I swore I would never go to this Pizza Hut again, but I got a coupon in my email for something free, so I figured I'd try it one more time.

And...they messed up both pizzas I'd ordered. I didn't realize it until I got home. I had picked them up at the drive-thru after dark and...well, I just didn't look at them first.

My expectations for this place are so low, I guess I should be happy I got both pizzas and the bread sticks, regardless of what they felt like throwing on the pizzas.

Once before, I had ordered three pizzas, they only had two ready for me, and argued with me about the third one when I was there to pick them up, even though I pointed out they had charged me for three! Lol...

Did I call and complain last night? No. Waste of time. Last time I did that they said I had to return the pizzas to get new ones. Ummmm.....no. I'm not going to spend another hour driving back there, waiting on new pizzas, then driving back home again because they made a mistake. I asked them if they could just give me a credit. They honestly said no, because they were giving out too many and had to stop. Lol...What does that say?

So, again, if you go here, expect the worst and you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I always have a positive interaction with these folks.  The food is par for the expectations of the chain, and it's consistent. The service is always great. Based on that there is no reason not to score a 5. It's not a custom pizza shop. It's Pizza Hut. It tastes like Pizza Hut is supposed to taste.  The service is above par so there ya go."}
{"text":"Haven't been to Pizza Hut in years.  Probably my last.  Place was dirty, bathrooms needed a good cleaning.  The only thing good about the pizza was the crust.  I asked server if they maybe forgot the sauce, her reply was they cut back on the amount permitted .  To me that's a large part of the pie!!!!  We ordered one with chicken ,ham and pineapple.  Maybe 8 small cubes of chicken, few more pcs of pineapple.  It's no wonder that they still are in business!  Never again!!!"}
{"text":"This is the second time I've had pizza at this location: Being next to my Christmas tree lot it is refreshing to know that the people working there take your time to make an outstanding tasting pizza. Great job at the Nellis Boulevard pizza hut delivery location."}
{"text":"Everytime I eat at pizza hut/wingstreet I'm always disappointed. I mean how do they make a great personal pan pizza but everytime the large is undercooked and flavorless.

The wings are nothing special-they charge extra for ranch etc.

Way to pricy for realitively crappy pizza.$20 for pizza & wings"}

One person was named Heather the other person was named Joe although I believe that Joe is probably a fake name.

Our hope is that the people involved will be reprimanded accordingly."}
{"text":"THE ABSOLUTE WORST PIZZA I HAVE EVER HAD. There was no cheese on the pizza and the bread was tough. The cheese bread was tough and didn't have cheese on it either. The pizza sauce was dried out and was too much. There was barely any cheese on the pizza. 

Lets talk about how the young lady at the counter took a 10 minute personal phone call on her cell phone. Never asked me if I needed any help. Another lady walks in and takes care of her and never asks if I have already ordered or need to order. Thank goodness for the woman in the back that came up to assist me. The girl  up front didn't apologize after she was done with her phone call. 

The staff was unpolished and look like they just hire anybody. I will never go back there. They could be giving pizza away and I would pass. Save your money and do not go to this Pizza Hut."}

{"text":"Placed my order online at 11:50AM...Pizza didn't arrive until 1:05PM. 
Driver also didn't bring any napkins, plates, parmesan or red pepper flakes like I requested online.

The pizza was frigidly cold. Should have expected that since it took an hour and 15 minutes to be delivered.  Had to reheat it in the microwave which as we all know changes the consistency of the crust/dough.

The toppings were also not proportionate to one another. I ordered the meat lovers, but there was hardly any pepperoni or ham. AND NO BACON! The pizza was overloaded with sausage which had a weird 
 spoiled taste. 

I also ordered the garlic butter hand tossed crust.....But there was no crust flavoring to be found. 

My workplace and I will be ordering from a different Pizza hut going forward."}

{"text":"The very first thing I'd like to mention is that there is this older grandma server/I don't even know what her job is. She obviously hates working here and doesn't enjoy her life (so obvious). She gave us the most ridiculous attitude 24/7 since we stepped into the so called \"full service\" restaurant.

First of all, her \"service\" is b*tching. I admit. She is absolutely amazing at doing that. A little girl (age 5) in our small group politely asked for a straw and the old grandma straight up yells at her \"I COULD ONLY DO SO MANY THINGS.\" Uh... you can't give 1 person their drink and give him/her a straw? And on top of that you have to yell?

The icing AND cherry on top of the cake is the fact that she was talking shit to her coworkers when she went back to the front to take of something else. Dude, lady, we're not that far away from you and the fact that you have an obnoxiously loud b*tchy voice doesn't not help hide you either. Telling your coworkers how you'll give us shitty service because we're \"asian\" and we \"won't even tip\" is just appalling.

Why the hell would I EVER tip a racist person when you repeatedly told us you'll give us \"full service\" AND you yelled at a little girl.

What's even crazier is that she automatically put down 18% for gratuity and said that \"we have to pay that, you can't change it\". I didn't see any notice saying there was gratuity for larger parties. Also, it is not state law for gratuity to be mandatory.

Another thing, so another family comes in, a family of 8: speaks Spanish and not that much english. When one of the lady's was asking the same old grandma server a question, she was giving her the same ridiculous attitude!! Seriously??

Please Pizza Hut. FIRE THIS LADY.

**wow, when she was giving us plates and utensils, she dropped a few utensils on the floor and said in a ridiculous asian accent \"me so sorry\". This is just absolutely horrible."}
{"text":"They seem a bit disorganized here tonight. I  ordered 30 minutes ago and my order still isn't ready for carryout. They were also out of the original pan pizza that I ordered so they substituted it on their own. I think I will use another location next time even though this was the most convenient."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I wanted to get a heart shaped pizza just for fun. He called the store ahead of time and was put on hold for a few minutes. Which is fine, no big deal if you're busy. He placed his order and the lady on the phone said okay it'll be about 15 minutes and hung up without asking for his name or anything. We got there and no one came to the front to greet us. They're obviously not busy because we waited about 5 minutes while we listened to them laugh in the back and talk to each other. While waiting I couldn't help but notice their beverage case was practically empty and needed to be restocked BADLY. I mean at least pull the sodas forward to make it look full. As a manager myself, thats not acceptable. The lady finally came up to the front and was like \"oh hey! Sorry we were just measuring ourselves!\" Really??? Measuring yourself??? If you're going to keep a customer waiting at least attempt a GOOD excuse. Make it seem like you're DOING your job. All in all, we won't be coming back to this location. We really don't go out for pizza often and we just wanted to get the heart shaped pizza for fun. I hope this place gets better employees or at least trains them better."}
{"text":"I have to give Pizza Hut on Southern Highlands Pkwy an amazing review not because of the food (not saying the pizza wasn't good)...but because of the amazing honesty and customer service! Tonight I ordered pizza for my family and had it delivered and in the process of doing a million things when I answered the door I accidentally grabbed my sons allowance money instead of the tip money I had set aside for the driver so I ended up tipping the driver 47.00 and had a very upset kid once we realized what happened! I immediately called Pizza Hut and the guy that answered was nice enough to contact the driver who's name was Luke. Luke immediately returned to my house to return the money and apologized because he had not even had a chance to see what I had tipped him. Needless to say my kiddo was very happy and I am more than impressed with the honesty shown to my family! So thank you Pizza Hut employees at southern highlands parkway!"}
{"text":"Terrible customer service!! I came inside and ordered a large pizza and an order of wings. After waiting for 30 minutes, they hand me a dinner box with pizza, bread sticks, cinnamon sticks, etc. I say this isn't my order. The cashier tells some ridiculous story about how the cash register sometimes changes orders, which made no sense. 

The manager approaches me with an attitude like I was in the wrong and says well you will have to wait 30 more minutes for us to make the pizza you ordered. No apology or anything. This will be my first & last time coming to this Pizza Hut."}
{"text":"Fast delivery! I normally pick up my pizzas but this time I didn't feel like going anywhere. This pizza was good! I ordered online, followed the process on my phone as to when they left to come to my house etc. I had ordered, paid and had my pizza in less than an hour. A+"}
{"text":"This is the worst pizza hut I have ever ordered from. The time before this, I waited an hour for my food and received it very near cold. I called and the lady said because I had taken a bite she was not going to replace my order and refused to give me her name. I had to go all the way to corporate on that issue. This time won't bother, I found a hair on the burnt cheese sticks, the pizza was over cooked and the soda was warm..... Are you kidding me? WILL NEVER ORDER FROM HERE AGAIN. I will stick to Russell and boulder. I took pictures of everything and will be uploading them soon. This location is disgusting, they have very horrible customer service and the food either comes to you cold or over cooked....."}
{"text":"Please educate Ms. Crystal, who claimed she was a manager, that there is an 800#  that customers can call when they receive terrible service from her like I did.  I asked her if it was a number customers could call to complain, with a smirk on her face she said no.  Ms. Crystal needs to be trained on treating others the way she wants to be treated when she spends her money and not to argue with customers.  At first she said I didn't phone in my order, which I did.  She argued and said I did my order on-line, which I didn't.  Ms. Crystal when you're having a bad day, DON'T take it out on the customer."}
{"text":"Just had a very poor experience with this store (the manager no less).  Needless to say you have lost our business.  I'm not suggesting 20 pizzas a year is a worthy loss in their eyes but we will not support such a poorly run store.  Goodbye PH, hello Papa John's."}
{"text":"This is the worst location. Orders are consistently incorrect and rarely on time.    Asked for a refund due to order not even being made after 20 min"}
{"text":"Ordered a pizza and cheesebread for carryout, when I arrived I was informed that they do not handle bills larger than $20.

After trying to \"break\" my valid US currency at the nearby CVS (which would not...)

I went back, to have the manager tell me they could not accept my valid US currency.

I guess throwing away food is better customer service than accepting a paying customers money.

I won't be back."}
{"text":"I had a good carry-out experience. My order was correct and ready when promised, the service at the counter was fine, the price was good, and the pizzas tasted great. The dining area was nicely done, there was a buffet, and a drive-thru. Nice!"}
{"text":"I had a very bad experience at this location and they reluctantly gave me credit for my next visit.  

I decided to give it  another shot and I am so glad I did!  This pizza was the bomb!!!  It was night and day compared to the other pizza I ordered before!  AND I did not have to wait 45 mins!

After the first bite, I called them back and let them know how de-lish this pizza was and to say \"Thank You\"!  I found out there is a new manager there (effective yesterday) name Tony, and he was very understanding, polite, and he cared!  Thanks Tony!  

I will definitely put this pizza hut back on my list!   And I will continue to patronize this now customer service oriented establishment!"}
{"text":"First- service was wonderful.
Bathroom-dirty.
Hardly any tomato sauce on pizza.
Nice salad bar."}
{"text":"My go to location when in need since it's down the block. Only thing that's holding  me back from more stars is that my order isnt made correct sometimes. Other than that I have no problems. ^_^"}
{"text":"The staff was very nice at the takeout section. He was very helpful in explaining the kinds of deals they have. The only thing I didn't like from them is that they kept insisting we fill in their online survey. I believe they told us 3 times to do so. Besides that, the food was quick, the food was fresh and the staff were friendly. I will definitely go back to it. Hope this helps!"}
{"text":"The staff at the takeout was very helpful. There were lots of deals at this location and they offered me online only deals too."}

guy-\"Total is 30.08\"

Me-\"Did you bring red pepper and parmesan?\"

guy-\"no\"

Gives $27 closes door 

I specifically asked for ranch, red pepper, and parm cheese and these hoes couldn't even come through for me how the fuck you gonna charge me for ranch and not bring it and how the fuck am I supposed to eat mah wings? God dammit Pizza Hut take this L"}
{"text":"It's a chain pizza, pretty good.  I love when they set up the tent outside and sell $5 pizza's"}
{"text":"Buffets r more than worth it, Also when they have the buy one get one. This is the best deal and best time to come! Service is so-so."}
{"text":"$10 pizza deal is where it is at!  I haven't had pizza hut in a long long time... I even want to remember the days of the \"Book It\" club where you would read a book in elementary school and you would get a personal pan pizza as a reward (dating myself now).

It was a Friday night and couldn't think of any options for food that was quick and relatively simple.  I was trying to go meatless that night, so the option of pizza came up.  Heard about the $10 box deal and it comes as a square pizza with 6 rectangular slices (good enough for probably 2-3 people depending on hunger level).  It also comes with bread sticks and cinnasticks.  I know it's carbs galore, but it was great for $10.  I'm not about to do it every night, but it was a good deal for the time.  I even added an order of the pasta since I was curious to see what it would be like to have pasta from Pizza Hut.  The Tuscan chicken Alfredo pasta (minus the chicken) was pretty decent.  Now I just need to try it with the protein in it since it was decent without.

I called in and picked up... so no hitches.  I did notice that the dining room was a bit empty for a Friday night.  The buffet was closed, so I couldn't tell you \"yay\" or \"nay\"."}
{"text":"Best pizza ever on Friday night Feb 17!!  Perfectly cooked pan pizza and loaded with toppings! Thanks guys"}
{"text":"Estimated delivery time from an online order: 120 min. Called to make sure it was actually out for delivery, guy says \"Our estimated delivery time is actually 2 hours.\" 

I should've just picked up an hour ago -_-

Don't bother with delivery here. Carry out is your best bet."}
{"text":"Great in and out place if you're craving for pizza. Clean and friendly atmosphere, definitely a go for everyone"}
{"text":"Utterly disgusting. I was stranded in Pittsburgh thanks to Delta and booked a hotel up the street from this Pizza (the) Hutt. Since I didn't have a car and University Blvd's sidewalks were covered in snow, I figured I'd walk next door and get some pizza. Ordered a Meat Lover's of sorts and it was just disgusting. Covered in BBQ sauce, not cooked all the way through, soggy and mushy. Really disappointed. I should have walked the extra steps to Primanti's."}
{"text":"This Pizza Hut makes me want to vomit. If I could describe the experience it would be to never go here. Staff has no idea what their doing, smells like marijuana when you walk in and management overcharges you then when you ask them to fix it, they expect you to drive 20 minutes back and return all food uneaten or they won't help you. Management cussed us out via phone and via person, when we called the general manager they said they have had several complaints of her cussing customers out and screaming at them and being rude. Yet they keep her on the staff? Great way to keep business when you have an employee who can't spell her own name and lashes out at customers because she can't do simple math or use technology in anyway."}
{"text":"This is the worst pizza hut ever. They can't get a order right. They have incompetent employees and very rude. Twice now they did not put the jalapenos on the pizza.  They are high priced and unreliable.  Why should i be charged for a pizza that is wrong.  The rating is a minus 10."}
{"text":"In the midst of the ghetto and streetwalkers on Boulder Highway there is a Pizza Hut. My husband wanted to go. He wanted pizza. OK.

Strangely enough the inside of the establishment looks new and polished, not run down. The front counter is clean and organized. The staff was friendly.

What I didn't like - although you can eat in this is primarily a pick-up/delivery place. The dining  area is small AND there is no pizza buffet! *gasp* That is what I always think of when I think of actually going to Pizza Hut to eat - the buffet! No buffet here.

The tables had no red pepper flakes or Parmesan cheese to sprinkle on the pizzas. Not even one of them. When I looked around to see if it was just the table we sat at I was baffled to see not one of the tables had condiments on them. Strange.

Anyway, it's an okay place to get a pizza, especially considering the location. As for food - sure, it's Pizza Hut pizza, it's hard to mess up. It's the same consistency, etc. It came out piping hot, so that was good, but we were one of three tables in the whole place. Kind of hard to mess up."}
{"text":"I waited 5 min at the front counter listening to 2 employees talking and decided to leave.even though i live about 200 yards away from this establishment i will just go the two extra blocks north to hungry howies pizza.Not only are the pizzas tastier but they have a larger selection. FCK pizza hut!"}
{"text":"Fraudulent business. NOT REAL Pizza Hut

ordered 2 mediums (Hawaiian and Supreme) + wings + pop combo through the LEGITMATE https://www.pizzahut.ca/home website

- order took more than 2 hours to arrive
- forgot pop
- the pizza toppings were pineapple, olives and peppers (not hawaiian), and pepperoni , olives, jalapeno and mushrooms (not supreme). Pictures attached
- pizza that came arrived in non descript white boxes, was not legitimate pizza hut. Came to the conclusion it must have been outsourced to another pizza store after they forgot/messed up/couldn't handle the order
- charged full price despite the lateness/errors/fake pizza hut

Horrid ethics, I paid for pizza hut, did not get pizza hut but a local competitor. How is this allowed or even proper business ethics? Be honest so I can cancel my order instead of supporting scummy, shirking businesses."}
{"text":"Joey is so awesome. Love his attitude and friendliness. We ordered three large pizzas and customized them to be all vegan. Joey made sure that our crust was cut with a clean blade and went above and beyond to ensure that what we ordered was vegan. Thank you so much Joey. You are the real MVP!!"}
{"text":"Haven't eaten here in a while. Tonight, ordered like 4 pizzas and bread sticks for take out. 


Terrible!   Undercooked.  Greasy. 

I'll never order from this location again. 

Entire slices had grease dripping from underneath. 

Breadsticks still had garlic dripping."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times over the last year and have noticed the food is consistent, staff are nice,  but the tables were a little dirty. Other then that, I'll be back...just clean up a little better guys."}
{"text":"It usually takes 15 minutes for a personal pizza but I was told 20 minutes, and it really took 25 minutes to prepare after making my order. Customer service was slow, customers were lined up waiting to order while workers were no where in sight. Once I received my pizza there wasn't even sauce under the cheese! This place no longer has good service...what happened? You lost a loyal customer."}
{"text":"Ordered a personal pizza online to pick up here. It was ready on time, staff were kind, and the place appeared clean. And of course the pizza tasted great. But when I grabbed my Pepsi out of the cooler and it was barely cold. Thus, a rating of 4 stars. Thank you."}
{"text":"Ordered some buffalo wings here and they were not as good as the wings at other locations. They were horrible and barely covered with any buffalo sauce. The wings also appeared bigger then other locations as well...they tasted low grade. Plus the outside of the store was dirty. The Windows, the door has gunk all over it...a cleaner appearance, better food presentation,....ughh, retraining of staff is needed! I won't be back."}
{"text":"Ordered lunch for my team and the delivery guy was over 20 minutes late. I ended up calling to see where the delivery guy was, and after waiting on hold for almost 5 minutes, I was told the delivery guy couldn't find us and \"tried\" calling us 4 times. We were in a landmark building downtown so it's easy to find. Almost 10 minutes after calling, our food was delivered and it was cold. I'd recommend doing a pick up there instead of delivery."}
{"text":"I usually wouldn't bother to review a place like Pizza Hut because well, it's Pizza Hut and it is what it is... However, this particular store is exceptional. While I can't speak to the delivery experience here because they recently rezoned their delivery area and no longer deliver to my house, carryout is always spot on. We order from here probably a couple of times a month (always when there's a special, which is often) and we've never had a single problem. Pizzas are always perfect and the folks here are really friendly. There are literally hundreds of Pizza options in Pittsburgh and we keep coming back to this store when we crave the Hut."}
{"text":"Always disappointed.  Pan Pizza is 10 minutes early and undercooked.  The guy on the phone taking orders sounds like there is a party going on."}
{"text":"Terrible service! No variety on the buffet! Manager was a prick! Salad bar was empty! No plates on buffet! Not a good experience at all! We won't be back!"}
{"text":"update from review on 4/1/17

on my recent order (yesterday), not only was i charged twice!! but the delivery driver must have hit every bump or pot hole on the way.. because the pizza and cheese bread were smushed! not happy"}
{"text":"I ordered online. That was fine. I then received a phone call and was told the boneless chicken wings were unavailable. Ok, no biggie. But then my preset was delivered 30 minutes late, and when I called to ask if it had left the store yet, I was told by a very rude girl, that I must have ordered at a different Pizza Hut because they had no record of me. Then I was put on hold for 4 min and then hung up on. When my pizza finally arrived, it was COLD. Never ordering from there again!!!"}
{"text":"If I could give this place MINUS 1 star I would. I rarely write reviews unless it's a really bad experience or a really good one! This place is absolutely total sh*t to say the least! If I could give the employees MINUS 5 star I WOULD! How hard is it to work for Pizza Hut? You put the chicken in the fryer and the pizza in the oven. HOW HARD is then to put enough toppings not to much not to little. How hard it's it to wait until the pizza is done I'm sure there is a special time you follow so why is my pizza cold and not even done yet? And you have one thing to do with the chicken! Pour sauce over all of it not only on one! Why hire morons that makes Pizza Hut so not enjoyable these days! Step up your game! And this location shouldn't even be open right now! It's under construction! My whole box of chicken was covered in dust! It looked like I got the food from a dumpster! None of the food I got was edible shame and shape up!"}
{"text":"Shame on the staff that works at this location, at first I tried getting the special of three topping one large pizza for 8.99 and was told that offer is only for online so I went to order for delivery online along with a 2 liter pepsi, then called the store to confirm my order and was told it went through and it would be delivered in 35 minutes I waited 50 minutes then called back as the food was not delivered yet, the answer I receive from a rude girl who picked up the phone at Midnight was that it was cancelled because the driver had said he knocked which there never was anyone at my door as I have dogs who bark when they knock and that he received no answer when they called my phone which was also a lie because i had my cellphone right with me and was laying on the couch in the living room waiting the whole time for them to show up, I tried explaining that it was all false and that i had been waiting the whole time The rude girl then said i can place my order again tomorrow I was already hungry and had waited an hour for nothing very very poor service!!! This was Friday Night November 13th. I really hope the owners  fix this staff because they feel like they run the store and can talk to customers however they want too when in fact I did'nt deserve it."}
{"text":"Gluten Free Review...

We very rarely order pizza. I am a very sensitive celiac and thought I would give the new Udi's Certified Gluten Free Pizza a try. We ordered online and the website was easy to use. Our order was delivered right when they said it would be and the delivery driver was very nice. The pizza itself was tasty. I did have the pizza cooked well done so the crust was crispy and the toppings were delicious. I did not get sick from the pizza and that is a huge plus in my book. I this is a great option for us when life gets busy. Sometimes you just need to order a pizza! I only gave them 4 stars because the cost is steep... but worth it for a safe gf delivery option!"}
{"text":"I think this is my favourite Pizza Hut so far in Toronto. I always find it so fresh and tasty, even when im bringing it all the way home."}

{"text":"ok"}
{"text":"My online order said my pizza would be delivered in 25 to 30 minutes 90 minutes later I still did not have my pizza and I called them to cancel they didn't give me a refund they charge my credit card I had to call Visa to dispute a charge I have had numerous problems with this location I would strongly suggest ordering from a different Pizza Company"}
{"text":"This was probably, actually this WAS AND IS the WORST pizza I have ever had. We ordered a large chicken Caesar pizza for pick up as they have a $10 deal, and everything seemed normal. Upon starting to eat the pizza we realized the dough was frozen and not cooked, so the entire pizza was basically not finished and raw. Worst taste ever!! Not worth any money"}
{"text":"I agree with other reviewer...sauce is a bit ketchup paste-y.  Only take-out, but the Brixx Pizza is in the same plaza if you want sit-down.  I also was not a fan of the thin crust which normally is my favorite type.  Not any flavor & dry more than crispy.  The toppings were fine and the staff was friendly enough.  I haven't eaten Pizza Hut in years but I was disappointed.   I won't go back though."}
{"text":"Good Pizza! Good customer service... well so far i havent ran into a rude employe(s) Lol that $10 for any size any topping any crust is a #Win btw (stuff crust $2extra)"}
{"text":"Not sure why I still order here, after tonight I will never make that mistake again. I ordered the pizza a little after 9 it said it would be an hour or so. Ok so I waited about 10:30 I called and the staff member said he left 15 minutes ago he's on his way I said ok. That meant to me he made other deliveries so I waited. At 10:40 I called back and no one would answer the phone. I called from 2 different phones online it said they close at 12. So about 10 after 11 I decided I should ride by there. I get there it's like a few minutes away and the whole crew is sitting outside smoking. Wow so I asked what was going on, the manager said oh I thought you said a different address. I said so that means you wasn't listening to me?she said our phones are muffled and I couldn't hear you. Really ma'am? So I tried explaining to her why I was upset, she didn't want to hear anything I said at all, too busy enjoying her cigarette I guess. I asked for my money back, she called her driver and he was at my house. The pizza was cold, he said he had a whole lot of deliveries and he was the only driver. So I'm standing in the parking lot with the crew it's like 5 of them standing there smoking and he's the only driver, really? So she went inside to refund my order to her forever sent another lady out to show me my refund. Very unprofessional manager, she could careless about what was going on wow. Never again"}
{"text":"Poor Customer Service, extreme wait times, and disappointment. I will never even attempt ordering from this location again. Clearly, Pizza Hut as a brand as well as the management team at the particular store could care less about upholding any kind of values or imagery about the company or food being put out. I ordered on line. Wait time was over an hour. By then the store was already closed. No luck actually being able to speak to a human being....... so unacceptable"}
{"text":"I remember a time when delivery places put sauce on their pizza. What ever happened to that red stuff? If i wanted cheese bread then that's what I would order. Decided to give them another chance after a couple months. Ordered extra sauce this time and got no sauce at all HAH! Shame on me. I'm ordering Papa John's from now on."}
{"text":"I guess this place is new, and I couldn't find an existing review page for it... so, I decided to make my own. It was much needed. My boyfriend and I were a bit hungry, so we decided to share something. We decided on pizza, as the price was decent... not, like, $13 for a sandwich. 
When we got up to the register, we were not greeted. There were freakin' three men behind the counter pretending to work and chatting away with each other. One of them even passed by the register a couple times without acknowledging us. My boyfriend wanted to leave, but I didn't want to spend much on food, and pizza sounded good to me. 
Finally, one of the guys washed his hands and took our order, but that was about five minutes after we got to the register! Anyway, we ordered a #5 - small cheese pizza, a drink, and buffalo wings. The food sits under lamps, but still... they tasted pretty good. Fine. You get one star for that. Otherwise, unfriendly employees. Bad service. This place is definitely not worthy of anything other than one star. I'm sorry, but Pizza Hut Express, you should try harder next time."}
{"text":"terrible service.  cashier ismae decides who she wants to help.  I order online and went to pick up my order.  I actually waited in the doorway because there were 4 other people ahead of me.  I waited for a total of 12 minutes to pick up an already made order!  fine, I get it...it's Friday night.  however, the worst part was after waiting for the 4 customers ahead of me to finish, the cashier (ismae) looked right past me and said hi to a customer that just walked in and said that his order was ready.  he (of course) had no problem jumping ahead of me. but why was I not helped since I was next in line!?  

this is the 2nd time in a row, I received bad service from this store.  the first one, the order was wrong.

to store management for blue diamond pizza hut:  your store is filled with junk stating about customer service, your team truly failed AGAIN on providing any kind of service."}
{"text":"Great pizza! Hot, fresh ingredients and a very tasty crust. I ordered two mediums but should have ordered two larges - it was gone quickly and we all wanted more. Will be ordering again soon! Also easy phone ordering for people who think online stuff is a pain."}
{"text":"This is a bit late but I have to post this. Some time ago the store was being remodeled, I walked in after a very long day at work and wanted to get pizza for me and my girlfriend, ordered 2 large 2 topping pizzas. My total was $40. I didn't realize this at first and handed the most nervous 16 year old I've ever seen my cash. Whenever the kid was asked any kind of question by any of the other customers, even simple things about items his response was \"hold on let me go ask my manager\". Who came up was another child who was no manager and blamed me for the error denied me a refund for pizza that wasn't made and then had me wait another 40 minutes for my order. I'm surprised pizza hut allows a store to go with out a manager. Unacceptable, don't go here."}
{"text":"Waited an hr and a half before my order delivered. One item wasn't delivered and another item was taken off without anyone contacting me about it. They offered a credit which I didn't accept but by one person that \"I'm sure a manager can't help you\" and by the manager to church and speak to my boss."}
{"text":"I CRAVE the cheese bread sticks & marinara from time to time. They are always really polite & provide great customer service!"}
{"text":"I don't know why I continue to come here.  They always take 30 mins longer than the time is quoted online.  Today I'm sitting here irritated when I walked in Noone addressed me and I stood there for 5 mins before I had to ask if anyone was working.  They knew I was there the guy making the pizzas looked at me a few times but never said like we will be right with you.  While waiting 40 mins I am still waiting. All the while phone kept ringing I overheard one employee dating they'll just call back.  

Found out they made my pizza wrong instead of telling me to begin with they remade it.  He gave me the messed up one and triedto make small talk.  But I was already irritated."}
{"text":"Decided to try Pizza Hut today and wish I would've stayed with papa johns. It was the worst pizza I've had in a while. I would have rather spent 5$ on a little Cesar's pizza. Save your self the the disappointment."}
{"text":"Tonight I ordered online the suggested time said it would be 35 minutes which it would be here at 7:56. The driver called at 8:02 stating he could not find the address, tried to give him more of a description of the house. Ten minutes passed I  called the cellphone number that he had called from, no answer. At 8:30 called Pizza Hut, wondering what was going on with the order. Was put on hold for almost 10 minutes, they stated the driver couldn't find the house and if someone could go outside and try to see if we could spot him. Very inconvenient and disappointed, a waste of time waiting on a service that wasn't executed properly. Won't be ordering from this Pizza Hut location  again with this type of service they're providing. Now I have to wait 3-5 business days for a refund."}
{"text":"Had the veggie pan pizza. Bottom of crust was a bit greasy, but that's just how pizza hut bakes the crust.  Otherwise, pretty good."}
{"text":"Awful customer service! What kind of place hires people who will answer the phone with what up what do you want? That is trashy and if you can't get an order right find another job this is pathetic! Do. Otherwise give this location your business there are better pizza joints all over this town close to here and obviously they don't care very much about their customers regardless so they shouldn't be bothered by losing them!"}
{"text":"This location has been a hit or miss for me for the last couple of months. 

Lately the toppings they add are large, chunky & unevenly distributed."}
{"text":"Probably the best Pizza Hut experience I've ever had. A group of 7 of us went on a weekday afternoon for lunch during the Christmas holidays. It was super busy but still worth the wait. Pizza Hut pizza is phenomenal when served hot. I would highly recommend this location. 

Honestly the lunch buffet did not look appetizing or fresh at all."}
{"text":"Everyone knows \"The Hut,\" but I want to shout out this old MOL standby for consistently delivering a quality product. The best part of this pie is the soft, airy, and buttery hand-tossed crust. Four stars for the pizza to counter some of the low-ball reviews about the service. They also have a drive thru window - holla!"}
{"text":"I've complained about the service here and have spoken with the DM about it. Staff is flat out rude."}
{"text":"Don't order your pizza from this joint!! Manager is totally incompetent and has no idea how to use a computer!!"}
{"text":"Ordered a large pizza with extra cheese and mushrooms. It came without extra cheese.  I've ordered pizza from here many times before and was pleased with the amount of extra cheese. . 

I called to let them know about the oversight and a guy came on the phone to tell me that he made the pizza and he knows he put extra cheese on it. It's too bad that I called to let them know of their mistake and, instead of thanking me for the feedback, they argued with me. I will never buy anything from there again."}
{"text":"We order ALLLLLL the time from here. Never a problem with service, always exactly what we want."}
{"text":"This is the closest Pizza Hut to my boyfriends house so we frequently order from this restaurant.  Typically we choose takeout.  Every time we've ordered here the staff are always polite and accommodating.  The wait at this particular pizza restaurant is usually less that other chains.  Inside the facilities are clean and well kept."}
{"text":"This place usually is not bad. They are cheap mediocre pizza with a lot of options. I just ordered tonight and didn't get a pizza though because they are at \"delivery maximum\" and cancelled my order. I honestly wouldn't have minded, but they called once, and when I missed it they never left a message, sent an email, or called back. After waiting an hour I called and figured out that I have to go somewhere else to eat tonight."}
{"text":"I have ordered from this location many times over the years and now I am refusing to order from them because every time I order from this location the pizza shows up not fully cook and I'm not a fan of soggy, wet pizza i have to cook it longer myself so that it is not just raw dough and the last two times I ended up getting sick"}
{"text":"I'm one of the few people who actually like Pizza Hut, but not from this location. Had it multiple times in the last 6 months, been awful every time. Soggy, greasy pizza. They have even given the wrong crust multiple times. Oh and don't order the red pepper crust because they will dump an entire bottle all over your pizza so it burns your face off."}
{"text":"I had to go to this location because the one on Cheyenne is no longer there.  Ordered online as I always do and it said order will be ready in 12 minutes.
I waited to leave the house 8 minutes because it only takes me about 5 to get to the location.  There was someone in line ahead of me.  
He asked my name, took my payment and said 5 more minutes.  I said ok no problem,  5 minutes later, the young lady ahead of me received her order.  
So now it's been around 20 minutes....I patiently wait.  Another 7 minutes later I get my pizza.  REALLY PEOPLE?!?!?! How did we go from 12 minutes to around 30???
Onto the pizza.  It was nothing spectacular.  I did order extra cheese on mine and it looked no different than Ed's who did not order extra cheese.
Guess I'll try the location at the other end of Lake Mead b/c I can't see myself going back to this one."}
{"text":"I wish I could give this place 0 stars. Our food was cold and we paid extra for jalapenos and we literally got 1 jalapeno price on each slice. Never ordering here again. If my wife wasn't so nice I would call and demand our money back."}
{"text":"Robin went above and beyond to take care of a small mistake that was made in the kitchen. Truly appreciative, me and my gf continuously receive tasty food for great prices and this is one of the better locations that serve Las Vegas. Thank so much Robin and the rest of the team!"}
{"text":"Worst Pizza Hut pizza I've ever had. Ordered a Hawaiian pizza tonight and it was over cooked, dry, hardly any cheese, sauce or toppings. Look at the picture I posted. One piece of Canadian bacon and two small pieces of pineapple.  Couldn't even eat it. Good thing I made a salad. Will not be going back. Too many other choices out there better than this. They should be ashamed to sell and call this pizza."}
{"text":"Simply put..consistently poor as far as being on time whether for delivery or carry out."}
{"text":"I love this Pizza Hut! I always do carry out and it's normally ready before the suggested time. The employees are really nice. Most of them give me free ranch. Free is always cool(:"}
{"text":"My husband and I came here one night in March with family. We wanted something quick and easy. This was the first place that we knew we could order something easy for everyone. We didn't realize until we walked inside though that it's literally just the store front. There's no seating. There was this wee little table in the corner with 4 chairs so it worked out for us (there were 4 of us). The lady behind the counter thought we were a little nuts when we told her we would like to eat at the table (and asked for plates and napkins). It worked out well but I'll remember for next time that we shouldn't stop here... We'll keep on going down Carson. ;)"}
{"text":"I ordered a stuff crust pizza with extra sauce, extra cheese and extra pep with the garlic sauce around the crust. First of all I should have done carry out instead of delivery. Took about an hour and 40 minutes for my order to be made and delivered. I only live 6 minutes away. The crust was really lacking flavor I barley tasted garlic on it, and I ordered extra pepperoni  I would expect to get that for the price I am paying."}
{"text":"I placed an online order at 11:33am. I ordered a large pizza, pasta, bread sticks, boneless wings, 1 ranch, 1 garlic, and 1 marinara (they NEVER bring marinara for the breaf sticks with the pasta). My total was $30.33 and the email said it would take 30 minutes. 12:03 came and went at 12:26pm (23 minutes late) the driver said he had to go to Rhodes Ranch, but he was on his way to my place. 12:33pm, 30 minutes late passed. At 12:40 I get the knock. The driver was nice and apologetic, heck he threw in 2 additional sides of ranch because I waited so long! 

I regret not canceling my order. But I had 4 starving people waiting! So we sit down at our table and start serving. First thing I notice is the crust is pale, I take a bite, it's cold and mushy. I take a look at the crust and it looks so underdone! So not a single person ate enough for one person. It pisses me off that I'm stuck with $30.33 of trash, literally inedible crap. So I look at my reciept, it says my pizza was delivered at 12:12pm....uh no, the driver called 14 minutes after that. So I start piecing the puzzle together. The driver drove all the way to Rhodes Ranch first before coming the .5 mile to my home. You know, it makes sense in my mind that going the shorter distance first to deliver hot food is more practical then driving my food around in your car for more than 20 minutes before bringing it to me. 

The reciept specifically says call the store with issues, so basically don't go and call corporate or post a 1 star review on Yelp without giving them a chance to handle it! Ok, I called. A girl answered the phone, I asked for a manager and was put on hold. Same girl (I think, of course MANAGERS never introduce themselves) answers the phone saying she was the manager. I explained my food was cold and inedible. She took my number and put me on hold. My signal failed. I called right back and a gentlemen answered the phone. I explained that my signal failed and that I was on hold for a manager. He said, HE was the manager (maybe everyone is a manager) and that he took the food out of the hot box himself and sent it with the driver, so unfortunately there is nothing he can do. I simply say okay and hung up. He didn't ask me any questions or even had a gentle tone. He was a douchebag, very smug.  Now I am stuck making CEREAL for my son till I'm able to go to the store. Thankfully I'm moving!!

I called corporate, screw you Pizza Hut on Rainbow."}
{"text":"If I could give 0 stars I would. I've had countless orders canceled without notice, but last night took the cake. The website said 45-55 mins which is reasonable for a Friday. I waited almost 2 HOURS for pizza. No one called to let us know it was going to be longer or that they were running behind. When the delivery guy got there and we declined to pay for the pizza he said \"you should consider yourself lucky because we're behind and orders are about a 3 hour wait!\" EXCUSE ME?! LUCKY?! And when I called the location to let her know that we weren't paying for the order and also what the delivery driver said, the manager gave me your lousy sorry about that and then asked what form of payment I chose. When I told her cash she said \"well that's great now I don't have to do a refund!\" This location needs serious customer service training. I get that they're busy but that's not how you talk to people period!"}
{"text":"Pitiful!!!!!
Service sucked!!!!!  We were in there for lunch and there were two other tables with folks eating. we sat there for 20min. with no interaction with the pizza hut staff.  So we got up and left.  don't think I'll be back to that pizza hut."}
{"text":"Greg is the type of dude who throws a killer party, but doesn't know when enough is enough. Listen Greg, everyone loves to come over and chill out with a keg, okay, bro? Everyone is super impressed that you can have 36 Natty Lights without throwing up, Greg. No, really. There's a time and a place for you, man. That time and that place is college or post-college hangs. Don't throw yourself in a suit, put some junk in your hair, speak a little lower, shake hands a little firmer and pretend we're good buddies all of a sudden. You're Kegger Greg, damn it. And that's the only relationship I want with you.

Pizza Hut? You're fine if I'm broke or drunk. You're Kegger Greg. You're a fine once in a while situation that I would never dream of associating myself with in public. You're kind of a disaster sometimes, man. You're fun. You are. But just... just get it together, dude. Do I need an artisan barbecue glaze on my crust? Do I? Do I need to invite Kegger Greg to my wedding? Of course not. Be greasy and awful and ridiculous, Pizza Hut. Be a big sloppy mess, Kegger Greg. And don't, either one of you, ever ever pretend to grow up. You're kids forever, dudes."}
{"text":"Do not order here.  Twice in 4 months I ordered a pizza online.  The delivery time came and went.  I called, and both times they said they had no record of the order.  Annoyed, I prepared another meal.  Then the delivery guy shows up with a cold pizza.  I called the manager the first time it happened, and he was very professional and tried to make it right.  The guy who answered the phone this time told me that he tells people not to order online OR TO ORDER BY PHONE!?!   How can you possibly run a business this way?  I'm disappointed, because my kids and I really like pizza hut.  It's just a crap shoot as to what you are going to get here.  My guess is if you order when the manager is there, things will be fine.  If not, have a backup plan."}
{"text":"Don't go here unless you like cold pizza and slow service. The crust is dried out and nasty and breadsticks are hard and flavorless. We have ordered from here a few times since they deliver to our apt but they are always late, pizza is always cold, and it's gross. I'm glad we're moving to Henderson closer to a better Pizza Hut."}
{"text":"Placed an order for delivery on line and was given an eta of 2:35am this store closes at 12am on a saturday. Called store to see if delivery time was right or what was going on only to be told they are not doing deliveries tonight just carry out...."}
{"text":"We, after seeing the new bacon cheese stuffed pizza crust commercials, have tried to order one several times in the last week or so. And every time we try the local store here has ran out of them?
WOW, when we called the store at 12:24 pm to find out if they had any because the website was once again letting us get all the way to checkout before voiding the order, were told by an employee that they had already sold all 6 of them......ALL 6 OF THEM? ALL sold within an hour of opening? Pretty poor dam service!!!!!!!!! The commercial should say that you are too cheap to make enough for everyone so don't even bother trying to get one.
WORST experience ever and worst service ever from such a big pizza chain store!!!!!!!!!!! Pretty sure there will be no response, and NO we did not order one of the \"IN STOCK\" pizza crusts.
We probably will not try again after being burned this many times on an item you promoted so much."}
{"text":"Horrible. Ordered in advance to be delivered at 330pm. After being 15 minutes late called and asked about it and she said it left at 312pm. I live like 5 minutes away. I asked if there were other stops and she said \"maybe\". Really?  You should know. I asked if its not here by 4pm should I call back. She said \"yeah, whatever\". About 10 minutes later he pulls up and the total was $16.45. I gave $20 and asked for $1 back. He scoffed at me and said \"don't spend it all in one place\". Now I'm even more mad. Then the pizza is on the cold side of lukewarm. We generally order from here once a month. In the past they have been good but the past 2 times at least they have been almost 30 mins late and no apologies either. But this attitude is a first. Called and spoke to a manager who could have cared less about our issue. Not happy at all."}
{"text":"It's not the Pizza Hut  from when I grew up. Hardly any cheese, dough is not buttery and fluffy like it used to be, toppings are sparse.  And they take an hour to deliver when I literally live 1.5 miles away. Overall a big disappointment."}
{"text":"The amount of butter Pizza Hut uses on their crusts is designated to destroy your stomach lining. 
This particular Pizza Hut made me ill a few years ago. The cheese was overwhelming and not in the good way-I'm from Wisconsin. 
They handled my complaint well which I appreciate."}
{"text":"If I could give anything lower I would. Very unorganized, host/waiter has no skills and when ordering didn't understand what I wanted. Only came here because we were craving pizza from a bunch of YouTube Buzzfeed videos we were watching the night prior. Lesson from all this, don't go to this location when craving a pizza."}
{"text":"Excellent and quickest service when you're starving and want pizza! Placed my order online and requested on my last two orders that they call upon arrival instead of ringing the doorbell and they did! They actually listened and the pizza is pretty good for a late night craving!"}
{"text":"Their online ordering system is extremely easy. I see advertisements at these Holnwon pizza places for eight dollars and nine dollar large pizzas we can't really go wrong if the pizza hut pizza is $5.55. The food was ready by time I got there as promised.  The old lady at the cash register was really nice. And I feed my family for under 10 bucks and look like a champ while doing it."}
{"text":"It is a freaking pizza hut. A clean and friendly staffed one at that.  The wings are good if you like battered wings like many people do."}
{"text":"Terrible service, just terrible.  Every time.  Isn't the definition of insanity doing the same thing over and over again, expecting different results?  Shame on me.

Most recently, I called Pizza Hut because I'm avoiding Papa Johns for political reasons.  They told me that they needed to \"confirm that I had given them the correct telephone number.\"  First of all, in this day and age, what business doesn't have caller ID!?!  In any event, I confirmed that, in fact, she had my correct phone number.  Astonishingly, she said she needed to call me back to \"further confirm.\"  As if that's not idiotic enough to require two phone calls to order a pizza, she told me, \"if I don't call you back in 5 minutes, you need to call us back or else we'll cancel your order.\"  Yeah, um, okay.  I'm going to sit by my phone with bated breath for five minutes, and if you don't call back, I'm going to call you back.  So I can have the privilege of eating your semi-disgusting, totally unhealthy pizza.  No thank you.  You can go ahead and just cancel it right now.  I'm pretty sick of Domino's, but I've had far better service from them. 

Oh, and by the way...if you order online to avoid the ridonkulousness, the estimated time is merely \"an estimate\" that you need to call and confirm with the store.  And so if their online \"estimate\" is, say, 45 minutes off, well that's your problem, buddy."}
{"text":"ordered a pizza online at 9:25pm the estimated wait time was 25-35 minutes.  my cold pizza arrived at 10:37 pm. very underwhelming. no apology either."}
{"text":"Pros: service has always been cool with us and they're really nice to kids. The flavored lemonades never stop flowing but it's $2 for stuffed crust, not 1 like the menu says. Pizza is pretty standard."}
{"text":"I was unable to book an online order from a place which is 1 mile away from this location. I called the branch and tried to explain the issue with the website. There was a ghetto lady on the other side and she told me, \"We are out of dough so you cannot book the order PERIOD\"
This is her exact response. One humble request to Pizza hut, please hire staff that is educated enough to understand the difference between a technical issue and running out of dough. Also, who doesn't say \"PERIOD\" to a customer."}
{"text":"No review on food. But we just kept waiting for 15 mins and no one came to ask is anything. Even when we were on our way out, no one cared to stop us and ask if there were any concerns."}
{"text":"First time ordering from this location, I was disappointed to learn the Cheyenne location closed because it was my to-go to Pizza Hut when we first moved to Vegas YEARS ago... I've been having pizza cravings so I was excited to get some Pizza Hut because I haven't ordered from them in a long time. We ordered two thin crust pizzas and dipping sauces. One alfredo with sausage and extra cheese and the other with extra cheese, chicken, mushrooms and onions with BBQ sauce.

I was disappointed! The crust wasn't crispy and it was mediocre. And their garlic sauce is NOT good. They need to bring back the old school Pizza Hut and then they'll get my business again."}
{"text":"Horrible experience, I put an order for 8 pizzas to be picked up at 7:15 pm (order was requested 3 hours in advance), I arrived exactly at 7:15 and they said they were running a little behind, which is ok If is 10 minutes or so but is not ok 40 minutes later, this wasn't for a party it was for a work related meeting and everyone was waiting on me.  We will be taking our business somewhere else."}
{"text":"I literally live 7 minutes from this pizza hut.  Pizza was out for delivery at 1:30pm, I finally received it at 2:01pm. And it was stone cold! Never again will I order pizza from this place."}
{"text":"For the quality of the food, the pricing and the convenience this is a great go-to choice if you're hungry and pressed for time - or just don't want to cook.

I don't understand all the negative reviews.  I've only ever had a pleasant experience and in fact remember a time or two when a staff member went the extra mile over the three years I've been ordering from this Pizza Hut."}
{"text":"I ordered chicken wings not what I got so I complained to the manager so I was suppose to get credit for it but never did. So I thought I had credit so I tried to order pizza with my credit and the manager on duty threatened me and told me to come down and go outside with him to fight him on April 29 ,2018 at 8pm unprofessional to give your money too"}
{"text":"This was my first time using the order for a future time option.  I set it for 445 to pick up the pizza. I got there at 448....BOOM! Pizza was ready. I paid, grabbed my 2 liter and left. I will say the traffic situation getting out of there is not ideal but overall great experience."}
{"text":"Very rude establishment. I had a problem with my online order and was charged for a order that was not processed incorrectly thru whatever channels they use. I called the Southgate store and a VERY VERY RUDE EMPLOYEE could have cared less and and offered no help as to how to resolve the issue. I was put on hold numerous times and then brushed off as if I was the IDIOT. DO NOT PATRONIZE THIS PIZZA HUT. THIS IS NOT THE FIRST TIME I'VE HAD A PROBLEM HERE. Unfortunately this is the one I'm sent to in my area. My advice is to go get your pizza or use another pizza shop. THIS PLACE DOES NOT GIVE A S%#T ABOUT ITS CUSTOMERS"}
{"text":"Did the online order. Arrive at the time that the food was supposed to be ready. 10 minutes after I'm told it will be a little longer, I'm told that the wings are going to be another 12 minutes!!!  WTF?!?  So now I'm sitting here in the store for about 30 additional minutes!  I wouldn't have ordered if I knew it was gonna be this long for one pizza and a few wings. Nobody wants to sit in your shack for 30 minutes when you've already been told that the food will be ready when you arrive. the question I have now is how cold is the pizza gonna be when I get home. I want a nice fresh, hot pizza. Not something that's been sitting for 30 f-ing minutes!!!"}
{"text":"Don't do it. Don't order from this place. Service is garbage. They never deliver on time. They often claim to only have one driver. They are rude. Never offer to provide a discount for the horrible service they provide. Worst Pizza Hut service ever. And this comes from a guy who has lived in several states. Don't order from here."}
{"text":"Can a pizza have too much toppings? Holy bejesus these guys really piled it on my pie yesterday. The current carryout $10 any pizza ($2 for extra cheese or stuffed crust I found out) is a great bargain.

I have to admit, the pepperoni lovers with Italian sausage and mushrooms pan pizza is too rich for me. I actually like bites of just cheese, sauce, and crust when I eat pizza. I am a big fan of the Papa John's down the street with the garlic dipping sauce, but if I am really hungry, this Pizza Hut is the deal.

I ordered online by web because their iPad app didn't have the carryout deal or any other deals (click on deals and you get some message about everyday low pricing and no coupons needed #fail). It was piping hot when I got there to pick up 15 minutes later. Great counter service.

Convenient parking lot behind the store. Carryout or delivery only. No seating."}
{"text":"Food is consistently good for large chain pizza but employees have terrible attitudes.  How hard is it to be courteous and smile?"}
{"text":"Im new to this neighborhood so ai was very hesistant to order online from a Pizza Hut that I had never tried. To my surprise they had very good deals! We ordered and our food arrived faster than expected. We got a medium pepperoni pizza and bone out wings. The pizza was nice and warm upon arrival - the wings OMG THEY WHERE AMAZING! I wish I had ordered more... But I didnt wanna seem like a fatass - the delivery guy was very polite.  

This is now my to go pizza delivery place!"}
{"text":"I ordered a pizza and garlic knots at 8:30. Order arrived at 10:45. Seemed a bit extreme, but okay. I got the pizza. But the \"garlic knots\" were in reality breadsticks that tasted like a mixture of cinnamon and cheese. I legitimately believe workers brushed some of the cinnamon off of cinnamon sticks and doused it with the Parmesan cheese mixture they use of breadsticks. No sauce. No garlic. No knots. I can only blame myself at this point."}
{"text":"By far the worst Pizza Hut in America. I've never had such a hard time making an order for a pizza. 3 attempts and never any food. Will never try again. I've had yelp for about 5 years and have never left a review, but I felt the need to this time. Wish I could give negative stars."}
{"text":"I ordered a pizza and cheese sticks at 10:15pm and was told it would be delivered by 10:45pm. Called twice between then and 11:30pm because the order still wasn't delivered and was told both times that my order was the next one to be delivered. I ended up having to drive to the location and pick up the order myself and I wasn't given a receipt. After I walked out of the store, my friend in the car saw the two workers making rude remarks. During the second phone call I was told if it wasn't delivered within the next 15 minutes, I would get a credit. I walked into the store at 11:47pm and ended up still being charged. Cold food and rude service."}
{"text":"I like the pizza, however I like it with a salad. Since they eliminated the salad bar I don't go here. Or order to go either. Bad business sense in my opinion."}
{"text":"First of all, the delivery driver overstated the price, so he could pocket the extra. When he said the price, I just grabbed the few extra dollars and paid. But when I looked at the receipt, I realized that I had been ripped off. That is so wrong! 
The pizza was just barely subpar and cold as well. When I order pizza, I want the cheese to be hot not cold and coagulated. 
The cheese sticks were cold as well and not even cut!
Basically, The delivery driver defrauded me for horrible pizza and cheese sticks. With ranch dressing cups that were rancid. Don't order from here."}
{"text":"Called ahead on the local phone number for dine-in.  Phone must have rung 8-10 before someone answered. When we arrived, our order was not ready. Based on an apparent shortage in staffing, we were suspicious that our order was never processed (believe that our call really ended up going to a national call center, as the order taker spoke with a Hispanic dialect and we observed no females during our visit.) Nonetheless they  \"located it\" and our order came out in about 15 minutes. The dining area appeared clean, however a table near us was never cleared during our stay (again, under-staffing?).  The light fixture over our table was bothersome, as its positioned height allowed glaring light to emit into our eyes. As for the food, we were very satisfied for the value and the quality of pizza that we were served. We would have rated our experience higher had the restaurant had been operating with more staff and the ambiance better."}
{"text":"The food is always good and hot, but what on earth is that odor when you first walk in??  It almost made me turn around and leave.  Maybe replace carpet?  Whatever it takes, please!"}
{"text":"Horrible service! I placed and order online and when I came to pick it up, they charged me for it and it still wasn't ready so I sat down and waited only for them to tell me they were out of stuffed crust and that they hadn't even started making my pizza! Oh and they couldn't give me my refund right now. I would have to fill out \"paperwork\" and wait to get a check in the mail! If they didn't have the right ingredients, why make me pay for something that I didn't want?!?! Now I've been here waiting almost an hour."}
{"text":"The team that worked tonight 06/11/16 did an amazjng job. The guy in front...service excellent. Best ive seen."}
{"text":"Decent enough. The prices are just a bit high. The best time to go is on the buy 1 pizza at a regular price, then get the next 3 for 5 bucks. The food is top quality I'll give them that. The service is pretty good and the staff are pretty nice people."}
{"text":"Really disappointed about the lack of customer service or experience.  One day I decided to see if it's really true that people really don't get through to this particular restaurant.  I decided to stand outside and order for delivery and no one picked up the phone.  I mean people were talking or chatting around.  I called three times and no one picked up.  Omg forget about going to the restaurant the wait is just as bad.  I'm disgusted and I really like the Pizza Hut in Harrisburg but they don't deliver to me.  Mad mad woman"}
{"text":"Horrible experience with a pizza delivery which was for a birthday party. The pizza took almost 2 hours to arrive. When it finally arrived all 4 pizzas was stale, old, cold, and dry because the pizzas were cooked with ZERO marinara sauce and I mean not a drop of sauce on any of the pizzas. It was so embarrassing and a waste of food and my money because no one ate the nasty pizzas so they ended up being trashed. Not even the microwave or oven could save those dry and cold ass pizzas. I checked my order and clearly asked for marinara sauce. They baked these pizzas with just cheese on top of bread smh! Will not use this Pizza Hut again. I recommend you check your food before they just drop if off."}
{"text":"We ordered the panormous pizza combo and just because the drink wasn't selected the manager reaz did not honour it when it comes with the combo that was done online.. Even our receipts shows the 2L drink.. Do not go to This location .. Very rude and no customer service at all !"}
{"text":"Worst Pizza Hut ever!! I can't even explain because it will make me so so angry!! Horrible!!"}
{"text":"Worst Pizza Hut ever! Never calling or using them again. They will make up all the excuses in the world not to deliver to you."}
{"text":"I was really impressed with their customer service.  They totally messed up my order and were so wonderful about it.  This was the first time ever for a mistake with them.  We order from here all of the time. They made my order again at no charge! They really know how to make things right.! Thank you Pizza Hut for your fabulous service!"}
{"text":"When I order a pizza for pick up and I still have to wait another 10 minutes, I don't expect the crust to be partially cooked. I paid for extra cheese but the cheese on the sauce wasn't even melted!!! It looked done when I opened the box but I got fooled. Now I'm waiting for it to finish to cook in my oven when I didn't want to cook in the first place. I won't waste my money on poor quality product from this location ever. You guys suck!"}
{"text":"Good pizza, was ready on time. But I don't understand why all the delivery drivers park right in front of the store instead of allowing those spaces to be used for paying guests."}
{"text":"Been ordering the $10 deal from here as well.  Not busy, lots of parking.  Staff is friendly enough.  

The one near Markville can get super busy, and parking can be tough, especially if you are just running in for pickup."}
{"text":"Ordered a pizza online at 7 pm, pizza got here at 7:45, and the pizza was made wrong. So we called and complained and the lady said we would get a new pizza and a free soda delivered to us in less than an hour. Well an hour and 10 minutes goes by and our pizza is here and WRONG AGAIN AND WE DIDNT GET OUR FREE SODA. Don't waste your time/money, go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Slow and rude service, with undercooked pizzas. Avoid this and head on over to papa johns instead."}
{"text":"Has this Pizza Hut improved?  The McKnight Rd store has closed and this is my closest fix.  I do not see any current reviews, and all the reviews are bad.  

I do not want to waste my time with bad experiences.  Should I avoid this location?"}
{"text":"I normally order a super supreme The only pizza that I've ever ordered from Pizza Hut for myself today I ordered Pizza Hut's special Primo meat pizza I have to say that I was excellent I ordered it exactly how they make it the only thing that I added was extra sauce and that was free Jessica the Manager is always helpful during the rush hour lunch and Anthony perderi is the perfect late night shift Manager Nick your delivery manager has been delivering to me for years Always polite and always on time you should have him as your delivery trainer"}
{"text":"This was the best Pizza Hut experience any of us have ever had! We met Snozz the delivery driver and tried to steal his pizza outside our hotel. After he wouldn't give us the pizza he talked us into ordering our own.

Best wings ever! The garlic sauce is incredible.  The pizza was great. Tubular dude! 

I'm amazed at how hot and fresh the food was. Sadly Snozz did not deliver to us, but our delivery driver was great. Delivery was super fast!

NO ONE OUT PIZZAS THE HUT!!!"}
{"text":"This is the most ghetto trashy pizza hut ever  ....we ordered food to be delivered from 2.5 miles away we were told 6pm it would be here .....7pm it finally showed up after making numerous phone calls about where its at.....the delivery girl didnt say anything not even sorry....i called the manager and he said ohhhh our ovens went down and thats what took so long ....y didnt u say that the 1st couple times we called.....he gave us a 10 dollar credit which is a waste of my time cause ill never go back.....oh yeah i say its ghetto cuz when they answer the phone the one guy was like \"hello whats up\" .....im like uuuhhhh is this pizza hut"}
{"text":"Bad service, long wait times. The cashier was texting when we approached and kept finishing his text before greeting us. Huge no no. He shouldn't even be texting on the job in the first place, but if he is going to text then he should put down his phone immediately when customers approach. This glaring error in basic customer service is costing the restaurant most of it's stars."}
{"text":"I am so impressed. I've always ordered from this Pizza Hut.. but tonight I ordered a stuff crust with chicken for delivery. It's a Friday night.. my order got here in 30 minutes. My order tasted like it had literally just been removed from the oven.. great service, fast delivery, good food. thanks guys."}
{"text":"Everybody knows Pizza Hut. Either you like Pizza Hut or you don't. This new location makes the same pizza as the old location, off of Cheyenne & Buffalo, but I think every Pizza Hut makes the same pizza. As this new location is less than 5 minutes away from my house, I have been going here a LOT. I always order online, to get the best deals & they have always gotten my order right. For the price, Pizza Hut Pan Pizzas are the best pizzas in my area. Rosati's down the street is better, but they are twice the price & they have gotten my order wrong a few times. On this location's service, I have only been treated very good here, with no complaints on their service. I have never used their Delivery Service, so I can't comment on that. On delivery drivers speeding, I have not seen it. Although I, myself drive 10 MPH over the speed limit, so they maybe they are speeding in the legal sense of the what is speeding. With the sheer number of times that I have ordered their pizza, it can't be luck that I have never had a issue with this location. I really don't understand their bad reviews or low rating. I guess Haters gonna hate, hate, hate?"}
{"text":"If I could give less than one star for this place I would. I'm already not going to pick Pizza Hut as a first choice for delivery but late at night there aren't many options, however I refuse to ever take my business to this location, ever again. 

Long story short I ordered online around 11:30pm on a Saturday, waited over an hour and had to call twice to make sure my food was on its way. When the food finally did arrive the pizza was still raw in the middle and my cookie was burnt to a crisp. 
 
The very next day I am on the phone with corporate to get a refund. Corporate ensures me they will be reaching out to the store to get my money back. The next day I take it upon myself to call the store to expedite the process, and the store manager proceeds to make excuse after excuse to explain the issues. Then she tells me that she will speak with her husband or whoever to get my refund. About an hour later I get a call from the husband at which time he proceeds to tell me that had I called the same night they could have given me a refund but that there is nothing he can do and tried to offer a remake or store credit. NO THANK YOU. Seriously the worst experience I have ever had with a Pizza Hut."}
{"text":"We just moved into the area and had a pan pizza delivered from this location.  From the get-go the phone service was great!  Very friendly.  My address is a new one and they knew exactly where it was.  When the pizza arrived, it was hot and DELICIOUS!!!  I ordered extra cheese and they actually gave me extra cheese!!!  Some places you order extra and it never seems like you really get it.  We will definitely order from here again and again! :-)   Hot, fresh, delicous, and great service.  Keep up the greatness!!  Signed, A Big Pizza Lover"}
{"text":"Came here on my way home from karate with my son and daughter.
 Arm inside, nice environment and was greeted by koko the manager! 
Not only wAs she nice but she made sure my pizza will be done quickly and gave my children stickers and a play book! 
And quality of pizza....
Well you or love or like Pizza Hut! 
I'll be back"}
{"text":"Pizza Hut has gone down hill fast. Consecutive poor quality pizzas. I don't know if they are cutting costs or what the problem may be, but there is little to no cheese or sauce on the pizza. The crust is paper thin and the quality does not reflect the price I pay for this pizza. RIP Pizza Hut."}
{"text":"THE WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE IVE EVER EXPERIENCED! I never do reviews. Everr. Just to preface how extremely horrible this pizza huts service was. Called at 7:02 pm they picked up the phone immediately and told me there would be a 30-40 minute wait. At 7:50 I talked to a girl who told me the pizza was out for delivery and should be arriving momentarily. We live 4 minutes from Pizza Hut. Called back at 8:05 after 3 minutes of hold time. The man said it was out for delivery and should be there no more than 5 minutes. I then called back at 8:12 2 times to be on hold for 5 minutes each before receiving no answer and hanging up. I had my husband call and they answered immediately. They not only had me wait 1 hour and 40 minutes they BLATANTLY were IGNORING MY CALLS. Even though I was never rude or disrespectful to them when asking for the eta. They also came to our house with parts of the order MISSING!!! The delivery boy said he would be back with it but I highly doubt that even though we paid a for a full order! The food was below average and the customer service was beyond disrespectful. NEVER ORDER FROM HERE!  My husband is a lawyer and I WILL be pursuing this situation further! The disrespect will NOT BE ACCEPTED!

{"text":"This is by far the worst experience I've had with Pizza Hut I use to love them but now I'd rather go elsewhere. I've given them multiple chances and I've had to wait many hours for a pizza and when I call no one ever answers. I've gotten pick up and there's only one person there and you have to wait up front at the counter for at least 10 minutes before anyone says anything to you. Do not go here or order here go to pap johns"}
{"text":"I have been ordering from this location a couple times a week. On the 29th I ordered a pizza for delivery once they opened. They called to offer me something for free with it because they didnt yet have someone to deliver it. What arrived was an old disgusting pizza. The cheese looked old, I ate a piece and then ate some cereal instead. Manager Mark told me that it was my \"fault\" for not calling immediately after the delivery so that they could fix it right away. I hope he gets fired quickly."}
{"text":"This spot is out of control!! I ordered my pizza at around 6:50pm and received my pizza at 8:47pm  called too see what is going on with it, and the lady on the phone said that they have just sent out the driver with my pizza. Too sad for people to lie about a simple (we got it wrong and we will get out ASAP)"}
{"text":"My husband and I ordered a large pepperoni pizza with cheese stuff crust. I was so excited because I LOVE cheese stuff crust, but Pizza Hut failed me. It wasn't the best. The pepperoni's were way too crispy, and it was too greasy. OH! The lady who was running the cash register gave me a dirty look while I came in to get my pizza, greattttt costumer service right there. Not sure if my husband and I will get pizza from there again, wasn't impressed."}
{"text":"A credit is not a fix for delivering the wrong order and missing items!!!! Wrong sides and missing sauces girl advices they are not taking anymore orders thus cannot send a driver back with correct order.. It was only 9pm!!!!! I already accepted the 2hr delivery time! The only thing that was correct was the pizza that was cold."}
{"text":"I keep giving this Pizza Hut chance after chance but every time I order delivery my pizza arrives cold or undercooked. I am 12 minutes from this Pizza Hut and it took 25 minutes from the time I received a text saying my pizza was on its way. I don't even bother to call and complain anymore, a credit for another cold free pizza does nothing for me. Unfortunately I'm going to have to take my business elsewhere, it's a shame because I really enjoy Pizza Hut Pizza when it's done right."}
{"text":"Awful service on numerous occasions I've eaten here. From order being wrong to food being delivered cold or just not appetizing after its delivered. If you happen to visit this location please be aware the customer service sucks. The employees to the managers move slow and without a sense of urgency. Everyone is literally walking around this place absent minded."}
{"text":"Why 2 stars? I didn't have a problem. Ordered online, ready in 15 minutes, $10 large pizza. Worked out perfectly!"}
{"text":"On of the best customer service you will recieve! Kenny has the most upbeat personality!!!!! 

Do a survey & get a free breadstick."}
{"text":"Came here after going to another location where we waited over 15 minutes without being seated. Awesome service! The gentleman serving was the only one and he was doing it all! Highly recommended."}
{"text":"This pizza hut has a lot of terrible reviews, in fact I had stopped buying here myself due to bad pizza and screwups.  
There is a new sheriff manager in town, and they mean business.  
They fired all the slackers, and things are really turning around!
Way to go man!
After all, how hard is it to make a pizza???
Great save!
Im back, and shaking the hand of a local manager who was willing to kick some tail to do the right thing. 
Hats off to the new manager!  
I'm back, and glad."}
{"text":"Had a coupon for a pizza bread sticks and a soda for $15 and they were out of bread sticks and the lady that was on the phone said that she can add on bread sticks for an extra $1 and it came out to be $21 instead of just $16. Then she said that it would take 55 min to deliver! You would think that a reasonable person would tell you that before you spend 10 mins of your life placing your order. So I told her to cancel the order and then the unprofessional retard just hung up without saying a word."}
{"text":"This by far is the worst Pizza Hut in Charlotte. The first time we ordered from this Pizza Hut we waited 2 hours and 30 minutes before calling and cancelling the order. They gave us a refund yet the pizza still arrived a hour after that. We tried it again this time same thing two hours and 15 minutes later we were still waiting on our pizza so we called and canceled. They once again refunded our money and the pizza still arrived about 45 minutes after we cancel. After that I vowed to never order pizza from this particular location again but after receiving a email from corporate giving us a free pizza for the inconvenience I thought to myself the third time has to be a charm. Yeah Right!!!  This time our pizza came in a timely manner but after getting the pizza in the house and opening up the box it was not even close to what we had ordered not our Pizza. So I called and they said we will send you out the currect pizza. So basically we still are waiting two plus hours. To top it all off the employees and the managers are unprofessional. Never got a apology or nothing. We will never order from this location again."}
{"text":"Fast delivery ! Food is good and warm. I also dined in and its clean. Service was quick and pleasant. This beats Pizza Bianca. I will be a returning customer :)"}
{"text":"We ordered pizza from the closest pizza place with delivery.  It started with the girl taking the order.  I had to repeat myself about three times with each question such as what did I want and where to deliver it.  The ordering was a challenge.

The delivery driver was friendly and the pizza was delivered quickly.  However, it was the worst pizza we had ever had.  It hardly had any toppings on it and had very little taste.

We've eaten at Pizza Hut in the past and never had a pizza such as this.  It was poor."}
{"text":"Horrible costumer service !!!!
I got there to pick up my order , when I got there the guy was on the phone , so I waited for him to get off as I waited three more costumers got there guy was still on the phone , he then got off the phone and I thought to myself he saw me get there first so he's going to help me first , nope did I think wrong he helped everyone else first and he helped me last , and then stood there and said sorry for the wait . I didn't even look at him I was so mad common courtesy help the person that was there first !!! and then he didn't even give me my ranch for my wings !!! Ughhh"}
{"text":"After reading all of these horrible reviews, I made the mistake of still ordering from this place.  Order placed at 6:12 pm, delivered at 7:36pm.  Order was:

1.  Cold
2.  Ordered 2 medium pizzas, both THIN crust, one pepperoni, one premium salami...I received both regular crust one with sausage.

Called store, told Mgr. the problem he said, and I quote \" the problem is our driver took the wrong pizzas\"  no shit genius.  His remedy was to have the driver go back and pick them up then deliver them to me...really?"}
{"text":"I would like to rate the food but these fart cocktails don't deliver to hospitals. As someone that doesn't know this area how great would it be to have someone bring food to the hospital when under emens pressure of a loved one going through a hard time. I'm sure these ass wagons will try to say that the hospital won't let delivery people in and let's stop the nonsense there. The nurses encouraged us to order from somewhere that delivers because the kitchen was closed. Pizza hut should be ashamed of themselves, and if they had a bad experience before why let that ruin people who may need them at some point. So I want to thank these fucks for another stress that was put on top of an already emotionally packed hard day. You have now lost a costumer that has bought plenty from your franchise."}
{"text":"I would give it a 0 if this thing would let me but unfortunately it won't I live 10 minuets away and it is taking them over an hour for a delivery what kind of service is that! This place sucks I think it's time to order from Dominos"}
{"text":"As I was out running some errands, I noticed the banner hanging from the local Pizza Hut advertising their lunch buffet and I decided to stop.  I recall seeing somewhere that they were only putting personal pizzas on the buffet these days, but that isn't the case, at least at this location.  They are full-fledged pies.  Pizza Hut pies, to be sure, but they are the real ones, not the baby-sized ones.  That can actually be both good and bad.

It's good because you can get a decent slice from the buffet.  It can be bad because with room for only four pizzas at a time, and with one of those at any given time being a dessert pizza, it means if one of the three main pizzas isn't one that you like, you may have to wait for one that you like.  This is an issue because the restaurant isn't very busy - probably the reason for the banner outside.  As such, the three pizzas don't go very fast.

Still, if you're at Pizza Hut, chances are that you like their pizza at least okay.  It's not like you're out on a limb to try something adventurous.  If you want more variety, go to CiCi's Pizza.  If you want something good, try Big Guy's Pizza instead.

Anyway, the pizza isn't bad.  You just don't get a lot of choices.  They also have pasta, but in my experience, it's usually almost gone.  I don't know if this is because people don't like the choices of pizza and eat all the pasta, because they don't put much out, or some combination of both.  There are also bread sticks, but they don't usually have many of those either.  There is a good bit of marinara sauce, but I'm not sure what you're supposed to use it on, since the pizza has plenty and there is usually little pasta or bread.  You can also get a salad, but it costs extra.

The service is generally friendly, but not very good.  The price is a bit much.  For all this and a drink you'll pay more than you should.  The one bright spot is the sweet tea.  It is sweet and syrupy, just like it should be.  Make sure you get plenty."}
{"text":"Freaking terrible. It took two hours for our delivery order to arrive. Projection was 70-80 minutes, I was fine with that... but 2 hours??!! come on. that's just obnoxious. not the first poor experience we've had with this location either. My oven is on as I'm totally expecting a cold a$$ pizza. Can't wait."}
{"text":"I simply don't understand why EVERYTIME I order from here the drivers get lost and can't find my house... the estimated arrival time was 43 mins and about an hour after I had ordered the driver said she was lost. After going back and forth I have given the delivery person directions 3 times very clearly... Even gave my neighbors address to try in her GPS. Clear that was too complicated for her to comprehend so she called us back say she doesn't have time for this shit and if I wanted my order I need to come pick it up. She hung up on me before I could even respond. I am an extremely pissed off mom who just wanted some pizza after a 12 hour work day!  I won't ever order from Pizza Hut again! 
Dominoes never gets lost. barrows never gets lost. Guess I will take my business to them from now on."}
{"text":"I hate leaving bad posts, but when a pizza takes 75 minutes to leave the store, it deems one. WTH Pizza Hut? With all the competition in the game, you failed. I called and they were waiting on a driver. I'll just Ubereats it next time. This is the last pizza I order from you."}
{"text":"Horrible experience tonight. Got confirmation that my order would be at my house at 9:36pm. I called the store n first time they hung up on me. Second time she answered n I addressed how someone hung up on me. Couldn't give me a reasonable answer. She told me that the driver was suppose to call me to tell me my order was being pushed back to 10:20pm. I was upset bc I got no call. I addressed that n she said there was nothing she could do bc she had told the driver. I asked her if my food was ready n she said no. I waited almost two hours for two pizzas n wings. She offered to give me a free liter soda. When the delivery person came my pizza was cold. My wings were not hot/spicy AND there was no two liter pizza. I did not get a sorry, no sympathy at all. Worse pizza hut expericence in my life. The lady also had a rude attitude with me. I know it was her fault but seriously, be more organized. If I just got a call n was let know that my order was being delayed I wouldn't have got upset n would have been morw understanding. But no one called me like she said she told her driver to do. How ridiculous."}
{"text":"Be sure to inspect your delivery to be sure you get what you pay for! Tried to make it up after but experience was bad."}
{"text":"This location has a listening problem. A \"Super Supreme\" pizza somehow got turned into a cheese pizza. And if you order pizza rolls for the kids they like to forget the marinara sauce. 

Even for corporate pizza to satisfy the kids this location needs to work on a few fundamentals such as listening and proper order entry. At least when they mess up they will own up to it. 2 pizzas and pizza rolls for $7 is kinda nice.

Edit: This location will make Buffalo Chicken Pizza which is an off-menu item. And they made it without fuss. Even though they messed up the order, the fact they made it and tried to make the order right warrants the star rating in our book."}
{"text":"I placed an online to go order of wings since they were 80 cents on wednesdays. I got the hot buffalo wings bone in. It said on the order that it will take approx 15 minutes for my to go order. No biggie. I was there right at about 15 minutes. Jessi (manager) helped me checkout and she was very friendly and sweet. She said my wings were just going to be a few minutes because they were still cooking and since I had to wait she offered me a drink. I couldn't believe she did that! By the time I got my drink, she had my to go order ready. Great service!"}
{"text":"I've only picked up food from here. I've never had any issues other than my last time which wasn't a huge deal. I did a online order and ordered two pizzas and they put the wrong toppings on one of the pizza. My husband didn't want to wait for another pizza so they credited us some money to our account. I love the pan pizzas and how you can flavor your crusts."}
{"text":"Absolutely disgusting! I had ordered a large pizza with several toppings on it, which the counter person gladly took my order. I get my pizza, I'm super hungry by now, only to find my pizza inedible... I called Pizza Hut and asked to speak with a manager, a young lady comes on the phone and proceeds to tell me that, \" We made your pizza with the requested toppings, and it came out horrible because of how many toppings I ordered\". I replied, \" Why wouldn't someone acknowledge that the pizza was going to come out terrible, as opposed to following through with the order\"? The lady was quite rude about the situation and offered no recovery. I love Pizza Hut and ordered this particular pizza several times, among other pizzas a few times every month. It's unfortunate that they lost a loyal customer for years, and I will never order from any Pizza Hut ever again! I'm not stoked about this!!!"}
{"text":"I emailed my order two times this past month. I was happy the young man helped me both visit was so so kind and friendly. I had stopped ordering from this Pizza Hut was driving to Durango location cause this place was so horrible. These last two orders have been great. I ordered before noon always HOT. Thank You Pizza Hut for finding nice polite people to work there"}
{"text":"I ordered two medium pizzas and in one of the pizzas actually had meat (pepperoni inside) which was not visible until you eat the pizza.  I am very angry as I only halal meat and this violates my religion and my rights as a customer.  By the time I realized the store was closed. This is unacceptable and I will not be ordering for Pizza Hut again.  when I called the customer care all they said is they will send the complaint to the store, what will that do? At least offer me compensation for my order. Or some some sort of compensation. Very unfortunate that such a huge company cannot even get a simple order correct m, very upsetting. A"}
{"text":"The WORST customer service experience I have ever had. I've worked in the food industry for over a decade, I get what it's like to have a bad day. I also understand this is Pizza Hut and it's not some high class pizza joint but this was the worst service I've ever received. We walk in the door and immediately are yelled at by the woman at the counter \"ORDER NAME\" in the rudest tone. We didn't think she was speaking to us so we didn't reply and then she yelled it again at us. We kindly gave the order name. She gave us our total and so we slid our credit card across the counter to her which led her to say \"I don't pick cards up off the counter.\" Odd, but alright, picked up the card and handed it to her. We asked for her name and she replied \"Temptress, go ahead and call, I don't care.\" We then kindly asked to speak to a manager and she replied \"you're looking at her.\" While we waited for our order to be brought out she started to speak poorly about us to her coworkers right in front of us. 

Again, I get bad days, I get its a Pizza Hut but I highly suggest visiting another Pizza Hut location or pizza joint in general. It's worth driving to a farther location for better service. Won't ever be back to this location."}
{"text":"Honestly the worst customer service I've ever received. I was placing an order for a friend, and it took 30 minutes because I kept getting transferred back and forth between customer service reps who could not figure out the address for some reason. Then I specifically asked for the delivery person to please deliver to his apartment unit due to mobility issues, yet received a call from the driver that he was \"in the lobby and would not be going upstairs\". Again, I asked for him to please deliver up to the unit, as it would not be convenient for my friend to go down to the lobby. Still a no-go, and eventually my friend's NEIGHBOUR had to go downstairs and pick the pizzas up. The drinks were missing from the order, but they still had to pay for them because \"it was on the receipt\".

Since when did delivery mean dropped-off-in-your-lobby? Why are we tipping $10 in advance for subpar service? Why are we paying for items we did not receive?"}
{"text":"Don't know why I bothered, the pizza was overcooked. The thin crust pizza is terrible, it tasted like a cracker with toppings and it was overcooked. This is a pizza place, how do mess up pizza!! The best thing about it was the delivery lady, she was very pleasant. The pizza wasnt cut correctly either."}
{"text":"The manager Brian was very understanding how our order was placed incorrectly. I got an ultimate cheesy which I thought came with pepperoni.. come to find out it doesn't. He made sure to remake how I thought it was ordered and the team there was very quick in getting the pizza out to me. The best part is the pizza was cooked perfectly. Genuine, caring staff. A+ would come back."}
{"text":"Great customer service! Food came out great and on time. The employees were all very friendly even though it was a busy Friday. Will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"Wow - tried to give them 3 tries - called them 5x.  Always an excuse and never got a pizza- horrible!"}
{"text":"Well, I was fine with this Pizza Hut location until I got delivery tonight. F***ing incompetent delivery driver destroyed my pizza in transit! What I got was a big ol' blob that sort of resembled a pizza. Seriously, how the f***ing stupid is management at not only this Pizza Hut, but Pizza Hut in general, that they hire inept drivers who aren't even functionally retarded to not be able to get get one damn pizza delivered without destroying the f***ing thing! If you're going to order from this location, ORDER FOR TAKEOUT ONLY! Seems they can't even hire delivery drivers who have an ounce of common sense! Though, takeout is hit or miss too since each time I've done that with this location, I've encountered stupid, inept staff members who can't do simple things like correctly use the POS system to take my payment. Seems the management of this location will hire any retarded dumbass off the street and give them a job. Actually, here's my advice, AVOID THIS LOCATION ALL TOGETHER AND GO TO MARCO'S PIZZA NEXT DOOR!"}
{"text":"I must admit I was nervous to order from here or any other PH after reading the reviews around here.  Took a chance on this one a few weeks back as my wife loves PH and I was amazed.  We grew up eating Pizza Hut but as time went on and there are now so many pizza joints everywhere I stopped doing Pizza Hut.  Anyways, we ordered wings and pizza here and had it delivered downtown Las Vegas and it was phenomenal.  Not sure if they are doing their wings different now but they came in a round type box and they were crispy and hot.  Usually places bring them in cardboard and they are soggy (Dominos the last few times).  

Along with the wings we have ordered the pan, thin and crispy and a hand tossed I believe it was.  We've ordered three times now from this location on Charleston and the pizza and wings have been great and the delivery has been super fast.  Overall a very solid location and we will continue to order here on our weekend pizza nights."}
{"text":"Friendly on the phone, the driver Eli was on time and very polite and my order was hot and perfect!  Love this Pizza Hut"}
{"text":"Terrible Customer Service when the product ordered wasn't what was delivered! Do not use the online order because they claim that they couldn't read a simple direction of do not cut and told me it was mumbled up yet repeated exactly what it said to me! Was only willing to either have me wait another half hour to make what I ordered or give me only a $7 credit for a product that cost me $16+. We frequent this establishment quite often and ALWAYS order our pizza's not cut and when they cut it they make a new one or give us a credit for it. They are able to look at your order and see that yes you asked for something specific. Very disappointed in a small town business that was so RUDE to a customer and tells me that I didn't order what I wanted and that because I didn't order it correctly and they use the website, it's my fault and I don't have options to fix it ... Tell that to my hungry 4 year old!"}
{"text":"i dont know what happend the pizza and wings use to be really good i ordered the big dinner box i asked for mild wings which didnt have no sauce on them my pizza had so much sauce that it was dripping every where my kids love pizza but they didnt even touch it i will never order from pizza hut again after this bad experince waste of money"}
{"text":"My fiancé bought pizza from here and in the middle of eating a slice, I felt hair in my mouth. Not just one but a few. As I'm spitting out the pizza, I'm pulling hair out of my teeth! Ugh I looked at the bread and it seemed to be baked within the crust. If yelp had a zero star I would be using it. Disgusted!!!!!"}
{"text":"Double check what they charge you!!!
Went there while visiting the Pittsburgh area, but before deciding on Pizza Hut, I looked up pricing on-line.  It said $7.99 for a 2-topping.  We went to the store, ordered, and added brownies.  After being charged but before picking up the pizza, I realized that they charged me $21 for a 7.99 pizza and a 5.99 brownie!!!  When I said something to the woman at the register I got a very rude \"that's the coupon price, you have to ASK for the coupon price\"....all while she was getting the exact amount of cash out of the register....without even looking at the receipt, no reversing my card charge, etc.  Seems she has done this before.  

I didn't realize that a price for a product stated on their website meant you have to ask for that price or you get charged over twice that price."}
{"text":"I'm a little shocked by all the bad reviews on Yelp this place got.

Firstly, I come from an Italian family from Kentucky and New York, so I'm real picky on where I get my chicken wings and pizza LOL...

It's funny, with all the choices of wings in Vegas, this is probably the best place to go get wings. I don't get their pizza too often, but their wings are seriously to die for. They're so goooood!!

And they're not too expensive, either. Especially on Wednesday.
Customer service is great. Ask for Logan or Sadie. Both very friendly and nice people.... five stars!!"}
{"text":"If you're going to get pizza from here be careful. We ordered 4 of them last night. They billed us and then sent them to the wrong address, not even on the same road. The called to tell us that a little girl wouldn't open the door so they left them on the porch. After calling to complain the girl wouldn't let us speak to a manager but she did send the cops to our house. What a joke!!"}
{"text":"Absolutly horrible experience here. Had to wait almost 2 hours to get served. They forgot my water twice. And they didn't bring out the food at the same time as the others at my table so they were done their meals before I even got mine. So I ended up getting it to go so I didn't have to make
Everyone wait. The place is extremely dirty and understaffed. I'd rate it -5 stars is that was an option."}
{"text":"Ordered thin and crispy. Wrote on \"extra crispy, please\". Pizza was soggy, nothing crispy about a thin and crispy at this this location. Awful. Ate one piece of a large and threw out the rest.  Soggy, soggy crust.
Don't waste your money here."}
{"text":"This place is horrible.  I got it delivered.I ordered extra sauce and got no sauce. I ordered bone in wings and got boneless. I ordered from here for convenience but that was a mistake it took more than an hr to get it. I will never ever order from here again"}
{"text":"The dinner box is pretty big 4 the price. The pizza here is pretty good. I love the cinni sticks and the chicken Alfredo.  I was an walk in and I didn't have to wait more than 15 which is pretty cool depending on how hungry you are."}
{"text":"This location is really fast! The manager is very kind and made sure to show us each and every pizza before we left the store."}
{"text":"This Pizza Hut should qualify as a historical landmark. It's a part of Brentwood tradition. It's where all of the school kids go when they have a half day. It's where families gather to sit down for a meal together. We've been going to this place since we moved to Brentwood in 1997. They make my favorite type of pizza-thin crust. When I'm in the mood for thin crust pizza I make a call. Craving satisfied!!!"}
{"text":"I've always great great experiences with this location. Always speedy, always hot and made correct. The delivery guys are almost awesome. I couldn't specify anyone, because I always order online, but the service (and food) is incredible. The one near my house always screws up. I may move closer to this side of town."}
{"text":"People in the hood need to learn how to follow directions. I made an online order and the driver read me what I ordered and looked at what I didn't order."}
{"text":"Got 2 pizzas and asked for LIGHT sauce on both this is what I got and barely any cheese on either one. Notified it was out for delivery at 7:28 (this location is only about 8 mins from me) didn't arrive until 7:54. The girl who delivered didn't say anything except \"sign this receipt\" gave us the pizza and walked away. Called the store and spoke to the manager wasn't really sorry about anything. Reversed the charge, but still very poor customer service and not worth the almost hour wait. Will never order from them again. If I could give it negative stars I would."}
{"text":"Literally EVERY time I order from here, my order takes forever. I always go in at least 10 minutes after the quoted wait time and it still isn't ready. Most of the employees are rude and don't seem to care about their jobs. However the pizza is amazing. I always order the big box which is a great deal. I leave this Pizza Hut frustrated with my wait time and rude employees but knowing I have a good dinner ahead!"}
{"text":"Sitting in the lobby waiting for my order and the phone starts to ring, after a few rings I  take notice of the time, it's 710, at 716 an employee walks in the employee only door he finally answered. Two employees running this busy store with takeout and walk in traffic, there is an issue if they just let the phone ring non-stop. It's now 717 phone starts to ring again at 721 I stop noticing. I wonder how many frustrated customers just hang up and go elsewhere. Price also an issue, seems to change daily."}
{"text":"My family always ordered from # 109 for over 10yrs, our house number ends 4949 and I, Sherie Arvayo, call from my cell, just lately the persons who answer the phone are very disrespectful when they can't hear what i'm saying and who ever answered at 4:59pm today rudely hung up on me. 2 months ago they messed up our order and whomever the manager was must have taught the employees how to act and talk unprofessionally. This is about the 4th time the employees are very disrespectful and mean. We decided to go with Papa John's for at least their employees are professionals and friendly.... I hope they close this store because you never know if or what they would put in our pizza!!!!"}
{"text":"I had lunch at this Pizza Hut with a colleague yesterday.

I like Pizza Hut and had never done the lunch buffet before.  It was $9 and was a good way to try a couple different types of pizza.  The pizzas were fairly warm.  The \"hot\" pasta looked nasty (dried up) so I didn't try it.

Our server took good care of us."}
{"text":"Very friendly, reasonable price, order is always correct, hand toss pizza is great, open late enough but I wish it was even later"}
{"text":"Unaware of what time they closed we called shortly before midnight and asked if it was still able to call for delivery. She said no we're closed and we asked what time they closed and she hung up. We called right back and they answered and hung up right away. I know they want to go home but being rude is bad customer service and could affect if a customer chooses to call them ever again."}
{"text":"just don't order the fries, soggy and sticking to each other.  They arrested to have been microwaved at some point... ay least I had the pizza mow on.  It was good."}
{"text":"Ordered for carry out and we were overcharged.  We were told we needed a coupon.  Don't trust their invoices. Go elsewhere.  The pizza will be better too."}
{"text":"Normally we dont do the big pizza chains. But the hubby kept seeing the commercial for the big dipper pizza..at least thats what I think its called. Its 2 small deep dish pizzas cut into strips and comes with a bunch of sauce for dipping.
The pizza was actually better than I thought it was going to be and my little one loved dipping the pieces into his own sauce container.
It was ready in 10 minutes and the service was on point.
Not a bad pizza for $12 bucks!"}
{"text":"worst customer service ever, I am less than a mile away and they can't find me? waited 45 mins, called and just got crap from the manager, canceled my order and of course it has already hit my account,,,better be a reversal on there by monday..don't order from this place..only gave them the one star because you have to to leave a review otherwise I would not give them even that."}
{"text":"Two times now they have given me delivery time of 30 minutes and have never showed up. I will never use this Pizza Hut again. On top of that they lie and say they tried to call but they really don't. I have call logs to prove it. Pretty sure the manager there is trying to do this to make some extra money with the drivers. The manager constantly called me a lier that I didn't receive any calls and then hangs up on me when I call back. He deserves to be fired. I will definitely being talking to thwir corporte office about this."}
{"text":"Ordered a pizza that was supposedly going to take an hour. Our order was late and so we called to find out what was going on. Immediately, the so called \"manager\" was rude and had absolutely no customer service skills. She was unapologetic and did not offer any solution. I will definitely never order from here again."}
{"text":"This is a delivery review. 

Delivery to Yonge & Eglinton area is fast and arrives hot consistently. No issues with menu items, except as mentioned, the pepperoni lovers is clearly not double pepperoni anymore. It's just a generic pizza with pepperoni. Skip it. 

I screwed up in an online order, and noticed only after the store had sent my order out for delivery. They offered to recall the order and change it for me, which was pretty awesome. 

4 stars for food quality. For \"Pizza Hut\" style pizza, this location is best in class."}
{"text":"I honestly typed in \"s***\" out of boredom and this is the first thing that came up. By the reviews I guess it was a proper search."}
{"text":"Horrible they got my order wrong and said that there was nothing they could do. I explained I simply just wanted the pizza re made but she said she couldn't do it. I asked for a refund then she said she could give me a store credit to remake the pizzas. I said that's what I was asking for in the first place. They remade the pizzas and they still look terrible. I asked for red peppers and parmesan and they wouldn't even give me any. I just took the pizzas and I just won't go again. Worse Pizza Hut I've ever been too."}
{"text":"Bad customer service. Called way before it closed to order pizza, then they had me on hold for 13 minutes and hung up. Called again and they had me on hold for another 15 minutes, then hung up on me again. Called one more time and the same guy on the line said they were closed, I told him that he kept putting me on hold and pretty much said \"oh well, we're closed.\" Worst experience at a Pizza Hut ever."}
{"text":"LONG WAIT TIME.  No one answers their phone at this location.  Food arrived 40 minutes after the 1 hour quote time (1 HR 40 minute wait) and was COLD. No apology. No call to let us know it was going to be late. I was disconnected twice on 2 separate tries to get through on their phones to find out where our food was and still was not able to connect after waiting for over 25 minutes on the phone. VERY POOR EXPERIENCE. I DO NOT recommend this location."}
{"text":"I don't know why I gave this place another chance, but I ordered my pizza well done and instead I got it raw!!!!!!  I think Pizza Hut needs to reevaluate there workers because when your order is for well done at 8:23 it shouldn't be at the door at 8:45....  I even called and spoke to the manager Keri and she said the WELL DONE order is in.   WTF"}
{"text":"Never will I give this place another single $! Stacy is an absolute idiot! Terrible service and frankly nobody there seems to give a s*** about the paying customer!"}
{"text":"I rated this as a 4 for my experience and taste. I had never used them before from Waunakee and the delivery was quick, pizzas tasted great, they were hot and a lot of topping all around a good experience."}
{"text":"I've ordered from this location multiple times for delivery. They always arrive by the time stated for delivery. The food comes hot and fresh, and the driver is always friendly. You can use the app to order and pay with a credit card,  which is very convenient. That way you don't have to have cash on hand and you could add a tip on to the bill when the driver arrives. Definitely recommend this location, I have never had any issues."}
{"text":"Bad staff, foul language, no customer service skills, ruined order, Would it surprise you if I told you they were unfriendly and nasty too?  Welcome to Pizza Hut at 6017 E McKellips Rd. Mesa, AZ"}
{"text":"Its pizza hut. What do you expect? But this one is pretty great! 6th time ordering with them and they have nailed it each time! (And i am difficult lol)
The staff is usually friendly and always surprised/thankful for tips(tip more people) but seriously if you want a pizza you can count on its a safe bet... however the cina sticks suck thats why they get a star"}
{"text":"The thin crust pizza is really good pizza for the price, and while I've had assorted ordering and delivery problems over almost 10 years of ordering from this location, staff has ALWAYS been pleasant and efficient about sorting them out."}
{"text":"Oh, how I miss the Pizza Hut branch that delivered to our former office!

I'm a fan of the thin-and-crispy crust, and Pizza Hut is a fraction of the cost of the upscale pizzerias in north Scottsdale. But trying to get pizza from this Pizza Hut is an exercise in futility. After three experiences where I could not get my pizza by normal pizza-getting means, I have officially given up and switched to a rival brand that isn't quite as good-tasting but that reliably processes and delivers online orders.

The one pizza I successfully received from here was fine, if you're feeling lucky."}
{"text":"This place doesn't get enough credit. Staff is solid, customer service is more than equal to what one should hope for. They aren't able to complete my order the way I entered it online and they MORE than made up for it. I'm writing this review in my car, still in the parking lot, for f's sake. Good job, Hut. Way to be. See you next time!"}
{"text":"1/9/2018 
Went in, asked for menu, no menu, ordered a medium pan with only ham and spinach which came out $19, waited for 20 min, pizza came out with literally 6-7 slices of ham, asked for some packet of hot sauce, they said it is extra (??!!)  
1/5 Bye Pizza Hut"}
{"text":"Horrible Pizza Hut!!! I called in for carry out. Got there on time and paid. I could see my food in the to go over and he didn't give it to me. Two customers and came in and he handed them there food that was right next to mine and there I stood. Still no food!! Another customer came in, he brought up their order the guy added a soda and he didn't know how to add it on so he have him the 2 liter for free!! He goes to the \"wing station\" and yells \"can someone help me with the fucking wings I'm backed up out here\"! Then they all started yelling. I finally told him my food was done, I could see it and he said \"oh crap sorry\" so unprofessional. We will not go back here and I am writing corporate!"}
{"text":"A five star Pizza Hut.  Our pizzas are always made to order with no mistakes and that is saying a LOT considering our orders usually consist of nearly EVERY topping!  They have never messed up our vegan orders (yes Pizza Hut can do vegan pizza!) and always offer speedy service.  They tell us our pizzas look good every time, too, which is nice!"}
{"text":"Ordered a 6-topping SUPREME LOVER'S® pizza that was overcooked, had hardly any cheese on some slices, and overall had less meat and veggies then some 2-topping pizzas I've had.  It was so bad it prompted me to write my first review on here.  Avoid at all costs."}
{"text":"Restaurant needs a update and needed to be cleaned throughout. Staff is friendly. Food was made correctly and was tasty. Service didn't take to long and other than the dingy look of the establishment it was ok."}
{"text":"I love pizza and had a hankering for some stuffed crust. We hadn't had Pizza Hut in so long, it seemed like a good call.. granted we ordered a lot, but the price was outrageous! My husband and I like entirely different pizzas so we always get two. We added on wings and bread. This was the most expensive pizza I've ever bought in my entire life! We were charged $65.00!!!!! Thankfully it included the delivery charge. We can go pretty much anywhere else and pay 1/3 of what we were charged. I will not be back in the near future!"}
{"text":"terrible service! Delivery driver was very rude and didn't even speak english. Neither did he speak it or understand it which i thought was very inconvenient. Why would you have him as a delivery driver."}
{"text":"My husband I went into the restaurant today at 630. The restaurant was busy, but not overwhelmingly so. While we were standing by the front, two other people were helped. We could not even get someone to acknowledge us, ask us if we wanted to order, or ask us if we had a carryout order. Even as we turned to leave, not a single employee acknowledged our presence. We definitely won't be back."}
{"text":"Awesome service! Always fast service, food is always cooked right, garlic Parmesan wings are great and always come cooked just right, delivery people are always friendly!"}
{"text":"Our pizza delivery options are pretty limited, so we have ordered pizza from this Pizza Hut location almost weekly since we moved to the area two years ago. The pizza is, well, chain store pizza. Good enough for Pizza night. But the service has been hit or miss. I always order online several hours ahead. Most of the time we get our order when expected, but when they mess up, it is unbelievable. Once, pizza for a party was delivered an hour late. Another time they called to say they were short handed and our pizza would be two hours late.  Today, the driver had a flat tire so he never made it. We got a call, and we're told it would be free and sent with the next driver. Then another call, not free, $10 off and they were making us fresh pizza they would be sent out in 15 minutes. Next call was 40 minutes later so the manager could tell us it would be two more hours because they had to remake our order so we got bumped to the end of the production line.  No thanks. There are better pizza restaurants, we are done with this one."}
{"text":"Delivery took forever.  Pizza wasn't hot and barely any toppings on it.  Domino's is way better."}
{"text":"If I could give this store 0 stars I would. As we speak I have been on hold for 15 minutes after making 2 previous calls and getting hung up on after asking to speak with a manager. My delivery was quote for a 2pm delivery and its going on 3pm. I call and ask whats going on with my delivery, and they proceed to tell me that my order was just sitting in the \"hotbox\" waiting to delivered. Last 2 times I've ordered pizza hut from this location, I always get the same answer and my pizza always come to me cold and rubbery. I'll just order from the Papa Johns right down the street from now on."}
{"text":"Usually, I get crap food and horrible service. Manager was nice, pizza was fantastic. Best one from Pizza Hut yet."}
{"text":"Wish I would've read these reviews before ordering from here and now I'm totally bummed this is the one that delivers to my new home. My pizza was wrong and when i called the manager, she said they can't substitute ranch for marinara.  I've never had this problem before.  I asked her if that was an issue,  why didn't they call?  I would've ordered a completely different pizza if that was the case.  She said since they didn't really do anything wrong, they can't fix it and the best she can do is give me 20% off if i order another one!  Ya right!  Like I'm gonna order another pizza.  When i asked why they didn't call,  she just said she didn't see the order. She was very moody, especially for a manager."}
{"text":"Normally this pizza hut is quick and deliver guality pizza.  Lsst night it took over 1 hour from when I ordered online and it looked and tasted cold.  Every other time has been good though.  I will give them another shot."}
{"text":"I wish I had read this review before going there.  Let me first say, the person who greeted me at the door was very nice, and very helpful, he gets a 5 star.   But, the Pizza was a negative 2 star.  Pizza Hut usually very good in the past, have not had for a couple of years.  I ordered online, timed it so I was there to pick up my pizza 3 or 4 minutes after it came hot out of the oven.  5 minutes back to home.  Pizza was very saucy, dripping of sauce, too much sauce.  Pizza was not nearly as warm as I would have though and the cheese sill had un melted pockets in the pie.  What happened to you Za Hut?  Obviously this location has issues to deal with."}
{"text":"I LOVE THIS PIZZA HUT!!! My poor sister in law probably hates me because I use to order once a week before I moved. 

I always get delivery and they are always early and the food is always fresh. I had a problem once with them forgetting the sauce but before I could call, the delivery guy knocked at the door to give it to me. I will truly miss the delivery people lol"}
{"text":"This is my favorite chain of pizza places, especially because of their pan pizza. Since its just me i only order the Personal Pan Pizza, comes out to about $4.21. 

My only complaint will be that sometimes i will order to have extra sauce on my pizza, but when i get home and take a bite, its like they completely disregarded that i asked for extra sauce. I've tried going to a few different locations and i haven't really found a certain store that will get the sauce right every time."}
{"text":"I came on Halloween greeted with a smile from Maximilana. Ordered a Hawaiian Pizza and Meat Lovers both tasted great .I've always been a fan of the pan crust . Close by neighborhood spot. I'll be back!!!!"}
{"text":"Pizza Hut is absolutely to be avoided at all costs.  It is disgusting.  It makes Duner's, located in the same shopping center, seem appealing, and you can see that it too gets one star from me.  That is all."}
{"text":"One more update. In the months since my last review, every order we have placed from this Pizza Hut has been wrong. Every single one. I tried to reach out to the district manager and he has become non-respondent. Avoid this Pizza Hut!"}
{"text":"the take-out cashier gave themselves a $20 tip on my receipt. I had to go through the manager and the bank to get my money back"}
{"text":"The experience I had with this company growing up was awesome (at least in my memories) But they have fallen so hard over the years. Recently I ordered a pizza and I had about 3 or 4 different toppings, and I ordered no cheese ( and they don't have the gluten free crust which is the dairy allergy friendly one according to the allergy website they use so I had to do thin crust- yuck) 
I ordered spinach ham pepperoni and pineapple. That sounds like there would be a lot on top of it right? Yeah..no. there wasn't even enough spinach to cover each slice of pizza. The pizza looked like a barren wasteland of crust and sauce. I won't be ordering again unless I'm desperate and even then I'll still go somewhere else."}
{"text":"This place has really a really rude person working here. Just go up the street to Domino's."}
{"text":"Thanks for not being open during your times listed of operation!!!! Great job at sucking!!!"}
{"text":"My second time ordering from this location.  Last time wasn't great but I thought I would given them a second chance.  I ordered online.  Ordering went smoothly and the food came within the given time.  It was hot and seemed fresh.  The pizza and breadsticks did taste good.  Definitely a big turn around from my last order.  If they keep this up I would definitely continue to order from here in the future."}
{"text":"What a place who in the hell would sell breadsticks with ice cold sauce and then say oh we don't heat the sauce .and to top that they over baked the pizza .just nasty never go to this place again."}
{"text":"I have been going to this Pizza Hut for about 5 years now. So I have an idea when the best times to order. Week days in the morning til 5PM are the times to order because they are usually not busy and my food has always been ready on time and fresh. Everyday after 6PM-8PMish are their high peak times, so expect to wait a little over 20 minutes for pick up. 

I usually order a large thin and crispy supreme pizza. A variety of wings such as their sweet buffalo, garlic parmesan, spicy garlic or their honey barbeque. I prefer my wings traditional. For dessert my favorite is their cookie. It seems like it is perfectly made and is the perfect way to end my meal.

The employees are very friendly every time I come in. Prices are decent. Make sure to ask for their specials first before ordering so you could get the best bang for your buck!"}
{"text":"Ordered a small pizza was charged a personal pan and had to wait an additional 20 mins for my next pizza but at least the cashier made it up to me and gave me a free upgrade."}
{"text":"Well, not much to say here besides their pizza sucks. I live less than 2 miles away and it took an hour and a half to get here. Received a text 30 min before it got here saying the driver was on the way. When it arrived, it was completely cold and lacked toppings. Also, asked for crushed red peppers and received two packages of grated cheese. Stay clear of this location. The pudgy fat delivery guy was a prick too."}
{"text":"Ordered pizza for a kids birthday. Kid asked me to make the cheese pizza, half-pepperoni after I placed the order. Apparently this pissed someone off, because what we got was garbage. This is the 4th and final time we'll be ordering here. Had to place another order at Rustica Pizzeria since no kid likes half of their pizza slice to be CRUST!"}
{"text":"the pizza is great and delicious, which does not taste it, so it does not know what pizza is. The place I order is close and the service is fast. As long as you feel and is ready"}
{"text":"I had a great experience here! The phone was quickly answered by a cashier named Stephanie. She answered all my questions very quickly. My pizza order was ready at the quoted time. I was in and out within a minute or so. Awesome experience."}
{"text":"ordered $90 of food from you on Friday. After 3 hours and multiple calls to manager got zero food and a ruined dinner. Good job!"}
{"text":"I would give this \"0 stars\" but the delivery guy was prompt and very polite! 
This may have been the singular worst pizza I have ever had. In all fairness I have never ordered thin crust here \" New York Style\" but wow it's some sort of cracker like crust that tastes much like cardboard. The toppings were chintzy and there was really nothing here to defend this thing. $18+ for a pizza that ended in the trash. 
I used to think Pizza Hut was not stellar pizza but at least a dependable place to go. This manufactured cardboard cracker crust should be abandoned immediately. Soo not good."}
{"text":"Not the best pizza you'll ever experience, but you know that coming here.  When you need to feed a whole table of guys on the cheap, this is the place.  Any large is usually $10.  I've always had great service here."}
{"text":"Wow...the Pizza Hut in Surprise at 13706 W. Bell Rd. in Surprise, AZ, (store #27003) is probably the most unprofessional Pizza Hut I've ever encountered. Here's what happened. Tonight, my family and friends placed a sizable order via the internet. I called when our order was 15 minutes late and was told the driver was enroute with our order, that they had been \"waiting for drivers to return\". I called when it was still another 10 minutes late, and \"Nathan\" the \"manager\" told me that the order was just going out. I told Nathan that I'd already been told that 10 minutes previously, and he said, \"This time he is getting your order out.\" I asked his name, and he refused to give me his last name. I told him I was going to contact corporate, and he said, \"This isn't a corporate store, so YOU HAVE FUN WITH THAT!\" and he hung up on me.

When I called back to ask to speak to the owner, I was put on hold for over 20 minutes. While being on hold, the pizza delivery driver named Shareef arrived and said, \"I brought you a free 2-liter of soda to make up for the problems.\" We REFUSED THE ENTIRE ORDER. I then called the store using my back line and the phone was answered immediately. So that tells me they put me on hold as some sort of joke, refusing to either transfer me to the owner or take a message. I assumed the owner would not be in at this hour, but that I could have left a message for them.

At this time the charge is still pending on my credit card, even though we refused the order (which was over an hour past it's delivery time). My credit card company will be doing a charge back on it should this Pizza Hut location try to rip me off. Given their unprofessional behavior, I wouldn't put it past them.

The \"manager\" is named Nathan, the owner is named Rachel, although they refused to give me a last name or employee number. I called the store back to get the store number, and they hung up on me again.

Two other people that had put me on indefinite hold were Paulina (when I called back to try again to leave a message for the owner) and Shawn (when I called to discuss having my credit card charges removed.) SO unprofessional. I've had to let the Fraud Prevention Department at my credit card company know that any fraudulent activity that happens from this point forward could easily be a result of these unprofessional workers. It's concerning when what seems to be a reputable corporation turns out to be a bunch of morons.

Update:  Now that midnight has passed, I see they refused to refund the credit card charges, although no merchandise was received.  Buyers beware.  Save yourself the hassle and order from a reputable company."}
{"text":"Pizza Hut buffets are hard to find and these days they are cut back to offering only pizza, pasta and dessert. But the price is right for the amount of food you can get. 
This Pizza Hut is clean and the lunchtime servers are friendly and attentive. We always order our \"favorite\" pizza upon arriving and the server brings it to us to select the peices we want. 
They offer a nice-sized salad for just .99. There was a variety of 5-6 pizzas on the buffet plus pasta and a \"dessert\" pizza.  
We've never ordered take-out so have no comment on that. 
TIP: 
*Give the lunch buffet a try!
*Tell the server what pizza you like and they'll             make it for you!"}
{"text":"This location is my go-to Pizza Hut when I have a craving for pan pizza and the online 10$ daily deal is on. And usually I don't have an issue with the pan pizzas I order from here. Except for this one time (recently) that I ordered a Chicken Ceasar pizza (online deal). 

I get that it was a 10$ online deal, but that doesn't mean the standards for the quality should go down the crapper. Whoever made my pizza thought they could get away with using a crap load of caesar sauce to mask the fact that they majorly skimped out on the cheese. Not only that, but there were 3 pieces of chicken on my large pan chicken caesar pizza. WTF. Is this some sort of fun game to you pizza maker?

Judging how many jilted customers they have amassed they probably don't give two ducks about it."}
{"text":"I want to like Pizza Hut, but they just can't seem to get their act together. What you see in advertisements is NOT what you actually get (see pics). Don't bother with this location if you want quality."}
{"text":"Wouldn't answer the phone 15 minutes before closing! Had me on hold for over 12 minutes then picked up and hung up on me. When I called back the closed message was playing. I waited because it said, \"if you already ordered and need to check your order stay on the line.\" Again, they picked up and hung up on me before I said anything. Horrible people that don't deserve a job! Plenty of people that would be happy to work..."}
{"text":"This location is a little slow even if you place your order ahead of time. 
pfffftt, although they are slow the pizza is always amazing. I love their stuffed crust meat lovers.

The employees are like what ever you know they don't really have the pizza hut dedication. At this paticular location they have this one guy that yells instead of talking.

The dining area is very clean.
enjoy."}
{"text":"They forgot to take my name when I ordered for takeout. Not I hung up two soon, I thought it was odd they didn't ask for any of my info and asked if they needed it, but they had already hung up. Then they decided not to make my pizza because there wasn't a name for the order. Good way to make up for their own error... It was the manager who told me what happened. She didn't even apologize for the inconvenience. She did tell me it would just be five minutes. It wasn't. Definitely don't order over the phone here. Or better yet, just go somewhere else entirely."}
{"text":"Pizza Hut has gone WAY down hill-- Our delivery took an hour to go 3 miles, plus it was missing something, which came 20 minutes later. Pizza was undercooked, horribly misrepresented with all dough, no substance, pasta was soggy &'overcooked!!Never again, and we had fond memories of pizza hut back in the day. We threw it all out ...what a WASTE of money!! Gonna have buy more pizza we truly love today to compensate for this failure!! Wake UP! LOL"}
{"text":"I have never got a good pie from this Pizza Hut, returning more here than any other place on Earth"}
{"text":"Last time I ever come here! Stay away!  I grew up eating Pizza Hut so there's some nostalgia but that doesn't make up for what's happened.  We arrived as a group of three.  There were three other tables with people.  We stood at the front for several minutes with no one in sight to seat us.  Once sat we waited and waited and waited.  The place was not busy.  Our waitress found it more important to clean some other tables than take our order.   Why not take the order and clean while the food is cooking?  The two stars is because the food was ok, though a touch overpriced for the poor quality.  The onions and peppers on the pizzas and in the pastas are undercooked.   The food is generally greasy.  This place has declined to a poorly operated mess.  In a world of so much competition its amazing how little effort this place makes to treat customers well.  Sorry Pizza Hut, you've lost three customers for life tonight."}
{"text":"Awful pizza, we ordered a dinner box with pepperoni and when we opened up the dinner box there was no pepperoni and barely any cheese. This pizza is disgusting and I wouldnt even feed it to my dog. What the heck is going on with this pizza hut?? This place needs to be shut down, never going back."}
{"text":"Location on Cheyenne and búfalo is not there not sure if they changed locations but this number is to there location way west by the 215. Update this for your customers to save us the waste of time driving around looking for a Pizza Hut that's not there..."}
{"text":"I order from this location for work lunches. I put the order in around 8:30 or 9 in the morning, before they are open, so they have the order waiting for them when they get there. We always have our work lunches at 12 so I set the pizzas to be delivered at 11:45. 50% of the time they are on time. Also, 50% the pizza is what I order. I can't understand why their success rate would be so low. I understand we are not their only orders, however when our order is the same thing at the same time almost every week, eventually it should be correct."}
{"text":"I don't understand the low rating for this Pizza Hut. I ordered a large pizza for $7.99 thru the yelp app. Was told it would be ready in 5-15 min. I got there in 10 min and it was just brought out and put in the warmer oven. The pizza was delicious and the lady at the register was super efficient and extra friendly.
Will return soon."}
{"text":"I came into this location on Country Club. I ordered 2 peoperoni pizzas and got cheese. The manager Dylan was so nice he corrected my order with no problem. I Love pizza! The manager was great!!! Thanx"}
{"text":"It's been a while since we've been here because of previous bad experiences. I decided to give them a another chance today because they had the better deal in the area. I ordered delivery, the delivery was estimated to arrive by a certain time, it came earlier so it came within about 20 Mins. The pizza was fresh and cooked well, myself or the kids had no complaints."}
{"text":"If  no stars were an option I would DEFINITELY choose that option! THE WORST customer service ever. I ordered pizza via delivery for my family, I paid online using the Pizza Hut app. 40 minutes later I get a voice mail from delivery driver stating that he attempted to deliver my pizza, he rang the doorbell and didn't get a response, which is extremely odd considering we are sitting in the living room WAITING for the pizza! I I call the delivery driver back and he hangs up on me! I then call the store and speak to Randy ( the store manager)   and he proceeds to take my order, I advised him that the order is already paid for, then he tells me that the order was cancelled and I'll be refunded in 1-3 business days! Now this all happened within a 15 minute window, the delivery attempt and the order cancellation. Smh if you're big on customer service, this particular location will fail you for sure."}
{"text":"This Pizza Hut has the worst costumer service that I have been to. Walked into the store and there were two men up by the counter and didn't even greet me. This went on for 6 minutes and they finally gave me my food asking what my name was. Never going back because the service was terrible."}
{"text":"I haven't been here in the longest time! Must say, it seems they have started getting more health conscious esp for their crust as it's no longer as oily as it used to be (pan crust). 

There are more options for the healthier eaters. Thin/crispy crust, whole wheat, etc. 

Our waitress was Liina and she was very nice and when asked what to get, she was honest. We got a medium supreme, medium canadian and a side of wings. The pizzas were as expected. I really prefer the thin crust! Extra dipping sauce was 75 cents extra. As for the wings, I thought they were super small! Smaller than St. Louis Wings ! What a rip for $7.99. But that was expected right? Wings at a pizza place hmm.... 

Service was prompt. We were greeted immediately and had to wait a minute or two for them to take our seats. There is a promo going on now, where if you purchase a large or medium pizza, you can get a 2nd, 3rd or 4th pizza for $ 5 !!! What a deal. The pizzas came within 15 mins. 

They were so busy during dinner hours that we had to pay at the front instead. 

Will prob. be back when we want an artery clogging dinner. 

Great place for kids... so many of them screaming :p"}
{"text":"I ordered delivery cheese sticks and pizza. Imagine my surprise when I opened the box of what was supposed to be cheese bread. It was stale cold bread with no cheese. When I called to see what I could do. I was hung up on by two employees after waiting on hold. They also refused to say their names. When I called a third time Christina the manager was very hurried and didn't even attempt service recovery. She was very rude. Obviously I will never order from this location again. We work hard for our money and after a long day at work ordering pizza shouldn't be this disappointing. I was told I could get a credit or cheese bread delivered an hour later. Frankly I am afraid of what they might do to the reorder. 
        Also, How on earth can someone trust a credit with no proof from a store that hangs up on their customers and refuses to say who they are. 
I wanted to drive the pizza back to the store and get a complete refund. However I was told that is not an option."}
{"text":"this location is always late on orders. I placed an order and was to 15-20 minutes. I waited until 20 minutes until I left my house, to give them the benefit of a couple extra minutes. get there, pizza wasn't even started yet. didn't remember my order I called in.  ended up waiting for 30 at the restaurant for them to make the 1 pizza.  All in all, it took over an hour to munch on some pizza. when it should have only taken 20. They get two starts because the pizza was actually better than expected."}
{"text":"Terrible service I called at 455pm for my order I showed up at 5:25pm and my order still wasnt ready they told me it was going to take 10 minutes on the phone..I asked why they told me 10 min and the guy gave me an attitude that it's the busiest time because it's Halloween...really? What a liar"}
{"text":"Service I have received during multiple visits has been very good.   I always order on line for pick-up and food has been ready on time.   Unlike a lot of pizza chains their pizza has always been very fresh and good.  Even the wings have been cooked correctly and taste good."}
{"text":"Haven't eaten Pizza Hut in a long time. 

Don't normally eat it unless it's free, and this was one of those times

I got a little personal pan pizza. It was just a greasy as I remembered. I just got cheese since something like pepperoni would have it swimming in grease. It got the job done. It didn't have a lot of flavor to it besides the practically fried pan crust that Pizza Hut is famous for.

It was free, and it was Pizza Hut, so not much to else to say about it."}
{"text":"Good customet service. Friendly workers that greeted me when I came in. My personal pan with pepperoni order was correct. I was in and out in less than 3 minutes.

Same greasy personal pan pizza. Still mediocre no matter what store you go to. It was free. It got the job done."}
{"text":"Horrible service and all the employers are lazy an liars last pizza I got was freezing cold!"}
{"text":"I purchased a Groupon , which I know is subject to availability. I called prior to placing my order and was told that it would be accepted and was even provided with the instructions to place the order. I placed the order and called back to confirm the order was placed and if I just arrive with the Groupon and was assured a second time that just come in and they'll scan my Groupon. I arrive and am told by the manager Debbie that it was no accepted. I explained that I verified on 2 occasions that it would be. She was not sympathetic to the misinformation and all employees acted clueless to the misinformation on their part so I spoke to her manager Terry. I explained that I understand Groupons are subject to location but that is why I called and verified. He stated that there's nothing he can do despite him being the owner and offered me 25% off. The employees and their managers need a lesson in customer service and need to be trained properly on their policies. It's insulting that 2 separate employees are lying to save face rather than to uphold good customer service."}
{"text":"By far the worst ever.  I practically had to walk in the back to be acknowledged and place my order.  Employees would walk by and not notice me.  And they weren't even busy!  It took at least 10 min for someone to come up front and another customer opened and closed the door a couple times to get one of the 4 employees to come up front."}
{"text":"This Pizza Hut never fails!  We always order online, and the pizza is always ready before the the estimated time.  They do run out of the pan crust quite often, so be sure to check before you order."}
{"text":"Isn't there suppose to be cheese on pizza? Don't bother ordering any 'specials', they cut back on all of the ingredients. This was the worst pizza we've had in years. Either Pizza Hut is hurting, or this location needs to be checked for quality."}
{"text":"Just went there today.. the place smelled like old gym socks, a bunch of teenagers standing around talking while the entire place was dirty the tables were sticky seats full of food empty napkin rolls and their was a bunch of food under a couple tables we moved our seats multiple times, even the menus were dirty. They don't like to clean they're too busy standing around talking. We were the only people there until another couple walked in, THAT says a lot. Won't be going there again. I wish I would've taken pictures. Get it together."}
{"text":"I've been ordering here for years. Always had good experiences, except for tonight. The manager was extremely rude about me receiving cold pizza.  She definitely needs more training and needs to be kept off the phone!"}
{"text":"I've given more than once chance. It's either uncooked pizza, toppings missing, or pieces of my order missing. 
Today we ordered onions on both our pizzas...there was one small sliver of onion on one of the pizzas. I paid for 3 toppings, I got two. Additionally, I ordered crust flavor and our mildly uncooked dough-y crust had none. I'm done ordering from this location. Absolutely ridiculous."}
{"text":"Just awful the pizza was garbage not Pizza Hut quality there was barely any cheese. I walked in and the lady said \"I will be right with you\". I said thank you and then waited for 5 mins until another guest came in. She came from the back and said oh I didn't know someone was here."}
{"text":"I love the food ,there fast on delivery and they're the nicest people in the world . Thank you!"}
{"text":"After my first review, I was contacted by the manager of the Pizza Hut close to my home. She asked us to let them make our order again, and my kids were up for it, so I'm happy to say that the second time around was much better and I would order again on a Friday night. I appreciate their willingness to make things better,"}
{"text":"Just had pizza hut and it was amazing I had not order from them in a long time. I used there amazing app and made a chicken,pineapple&bacon pizza with Parmesan crust. It got delivery pretty fast and the lady that deliver was so friendly. Definitely going to order from this location more. Keep up the amazing work."}
{"text":"Pizza was good. But delivery really disappointing. I wouldn't order again and do not recommend. 

We were really needing the pizza to arrive on time with guests and kids over. Was told it would be here in about half an hour- perfect. About an hour later I called to check in and was told driver would be there any minute. Waited another 20 mins and called back and operator was shocked and told me he would call the driver. Waited another length of time- maybe 10-20 more mins and driver showed up. He said that normally delivery was much faster and apologized and said that they are just busy on Thursday nights. Then I paid and he told me 'oh no you ordered 3 water bottles and I only have 2.' I told him it was ok and that was that. He apologized and asked if I was sure and then he left. 

I was not impressed to say the least. My experience might be rare with them but I wouldn't chance it. We will order pizza from elsewhere next time."}
{"text":"Fast and  friendly. They burnt my wings so they fried me some new ones and threw some more in there. I love wing Wednesday!"}
{"text":"I placed an order online at 6:40pm, and the email said our order would be delivered at 7:40pm.  The order tracker said the order would arrive in an estimated 53-63 minutes. I got a text at 8:17pm that my order was out for delivery. The order arrived at 8:36pm. The pizzas were barely warm, and each pizza was barely halfway covered with cheese.  I called at 8:20pm, and they knew the orders would be late and failed to call me. Next time, I'll call Dominos or the Italian guys up the road."}
{"text":"I recently noticed that this place was reported to be \"Closed\" ,but actually the business is definitely in business. I give this place 4stars on their service..."}
{"text":"A horrible experience. Restaurant allowed a customer group to play rap music loudly at their table throughout their stay off their plugged-in phone & the content was highly inappropriate and relentless. Ruined my dinner. Couldn't believe such rude behavior was tolerated by management, ignoring everyone else in establishment. Won't visit this restaurant again as a result. Pizza quality just mediocre, couldn't overcome the disastrous environment."}
{"text":"My order total was only 28$ dollars and they charged me 36$ on my card. I called them and asked them why it was that much they said I wrote an 7.-tip even though I never wrote a tip on the receipt.. I told them that I never wrote a tip and they said there was nothing they could do about it... wow worst customer service ever..."}
{"text":"I ordered a panmormous game day combo and was extremely unsatisfied with the unedible pizza that arrived.  Due to availability, the panormous pizza was switched with two medium pizzas, with NO SAUCE on them in spite of the fact that I ordered DOUBLE sauce.  I also ordered boneless chicken wings and was given wings that were half boneless half boned (how the heck did this happen?)

I could have easily gone to a less costly pizza restaurant and ordered from them but chose Pizza Hut due the normally consistent quality I receive.  I will not be ordering from this store again."}
{"text":"I like the pizza but not worth the long wait. We ordered a pizza to eat their and we ask for plates and they told us they no longer have plates. To order wings it was a 30 minute wait why !"}
{"text":"Hello Pizza Hut,
I just wanted to reach out and let you guys know that after the worst week all I really wanted was my favorite pasta from Pizza Hut . I ordered it for carry out yesterday and went to the location I always order from and they didn't have it they told me it was at the location on tropical. So I went to that location to find out they didn't have it either. So I just went home and said whatever. Today I still really wanted the pasta so I order it for Delivery because I was not trying to go back to the store and this is what was delivered.
Way to go. You lost a long term customers. This really shows how much you care about your customers and food quality"}
{"text":"Food was great! Thanks! Especially since it was 11pm and we were hungry!!   Best gluten free pizza EVER!"}
{"text":"I love to order my pies on their app and then do the quick drive-thru 'drive by' to pick them up. They are done in 15 mins (a little longer for pan pizzas). The app has all the specials included and makes it really easy to order your food. Their dessert pizzas are super low cal and low fat (jk!). At least that's what I tell myself. Pretty good pizzas for the price. I like to get their 2 medium pies for 6.99/each. You have to order 2 medium pies to get this deal. You can even go 1/2 1/2 on them to get 4 different pizza options for the meal. The app also covers 1/2 1/2 pie orders. Do watch some of their deals. Some are for online orders only. They do have a walk in area (quite small) in case you don't have time to plan ahead. There's no eat-in tables, so the food is mostly 'to go' here. FYI, I've ordered delivery from this location and it has taken about 45-60 minutes to get the order."}
{"text":"Horrible all around can't get orders correctly over the phone before you give them your money and then screw it up worse if you go in. I'm starting to think all pizza huts in Charlotte are jokes"}
{"text":"The worst Pizza Hut in Charlotte. Call to place order constantly placed on hold as the girl checks every little thing then ask me what I was ordering again and again finally just said screw it. Used to enjoy pizza from here every once and a while but the people who work here make it impossible"}
{"text":"The pizza's pretty good here. The prices for beer are great for the size. The few times I've been here, it hasn't been busy. Service is quick and friendly. Prices are how it should be."}
{"text":"Need to update this review... Honestly maybe they were having an off day. We have ordered from them two times in the last month and both times the lady who answered the phone was amazing. We happen to pick up both times and pizza was ready on time. Great service keep it up."}
{"text":"Really slow service.  Delivery and pick up.  My pizza looked like the workers cut out pieces for lunch and just lined it back up so it wasn't noticable."}
{"text":"Don't bother asking for what the specials are because the women's going to tell you \"whatever is in the flyer\". After I got that response, I left and went next door to Pizzaiolo. It's no wonder that place is always empty. Keep up the bad work and hopefully a better business will take over."}
{"text":"Pizza Hut while pizza tastes great, my wife and I always get a stomachache after eating it. Pizza Hut is well known to use a chemical to soften it's crust, it's the same chemical used in yoga mats. I steer clear of this as much as possible"}
{"text":"This place has messed up on my last two orders and it is always on the cheese sticks. The first time I got bread sticks instead of cheese sticks and this last time I didn't get marinara. I called back asking if they could bring me some. They were apologetic and said they would bring some right away, which they did... But it was cold!"}
{"text":"We have ordered pizza and more from here on two occasions. Once we picked up and once we ordered online for delivery.

When we went in to pick up the gentleman at the counter was very pleasant and really had me thinking as I walked away that it was probably the best customer service I ever got from a Pizza Hut (and I have been to MANY locations). And the order was made right, everything looked good and was piping hot. One thing that other chains do all the time that drives me nuts is when they don't perforated the dough and when the pizza cooks the crust bubbles up. I have never seen this happen with a pizza at Pizza Hut!

The other time we ordered online, we were very impressed with how fast the order arrived and how hot and fresh the food was! (We do live less than a mile from this location) 30 minutes from the time the order was placed online and it was a large order!

It looks like many reviewers have had problems with this location but it has been the opposite experience for my family. We have received great service and great food from this location."}
{"text":"Very unhappy.  Placed an order on line at 4:53pm.  At 6:08 I had not received my order so I called them to find out what happened.  For about 15 min they asked me a few questions and placed me on hold.  Finally someone came on the line who did not identify himself and told me they had no order and had an order that was cxld.  I told him I have the email conformation in front of me.. And all he could say is I have no order for you and I show you did not place one.  I would have thought he would of said I am so sorry there has been a mix up, we can make your order and get it out shortly.. But no.. So I advised I would no longer order from them ever again.. Poor poor customer service!!"}
{"text":"We were charged the correct amount but what we received was completely wrong. We ordered two pizzas and 18 med wings. What we got was two different wing types and a thick crust pep pizza which was not good and garlic knots. The driver was tipped very well. So where did the error happen?? Want to hear back from someone at the location!!"}
{"text":"Really bad service with my pickup order
They switched my pizza with someone else's, when I asked for my pizza they had already given it to someone else, and I had to wait 20 more minutes for my pizza
The whole time I got an attitude from the cashier 
Worse fast food experience ever"}
{"text":"a clean freindly environment. a charming staff and a huge menu. our orders are always taken with a friendly greeting and a promot order. have frequented this location and have always been pleased with the product and staff. a salad bar and plentiful. drink refill awaits. the menu now has a. dogbites pizza wow.... here are some pics enjoy
Prices here are very affordable awesome deals."}
{"text":"price is ok, they got a deal, 1 large pizza, any 3 toppings with a side of 8 pcs buffalo wings for 20+ not bad for the very hungry. I picked bacon, pepperoni and pineapples for my topping and I had trouble finding the pepperoni and bacon. I guess I ordered a pineapple thin crust pizza lol. I requested for square slices, not slices cut by a preschooler, pretty messy on the slice instruction. Taste is just ok, hope to find a better  pizzeria!"}
{"text":"What a disappointment the server that toke my order is a CLOWN! she even gave me attitude for calling to check on my order since I had made my order an hour ago! she had the mordacity to ask if I was calling to complain or to check on my order I asked to speak to the manager the managers name is Anthony all he said was he would talk to her! He didn't accommodate anything or apologies for their mistakes! my order was in hour late it wasn't complete when it got to my house the delivery guy was rude I asked for my sauces and told me he forgot wtf I paid to get my food and all I got was SHITTY SERVICE ,BAD COLD FOOD, AND INCOMPLETE ORDER!!!"}
{"text":"If I could give them less than one star, I would. They messed up an order of ours about three weeks ago. As a result, they gave us a $10 future credit. I was satisfied with that.
This evening, I wanted to use that credit. I called in my order and talked to no les than three different people. I was assured my order would be $5. I paid by credit card, over the phone. When the delivery girl got here, she tried to charge me $17 For a $12.99 order. She said the $10 had already been deducted.
After two calls to the store, we got it straightened out. The delivery girl was supposed to bring back our pizza and not try to charge me anything. After another thirty minutes, she returned with a soggy pizza. The place has become one huge cluster fork."}
{"text":"Even if you're just looking for fast and cheap (screw delicious), you're going to be disappointed

What happened to Pizza Hut?  I actually have fond childhood memories of pizza feeds at the Hut.  Toppings were plentiful, the sauce palatable and oh that buttery crust.  

Over the years, the pizza has morphed into a bland corporate pizza doppelganger that fills the stomach, but not the soul like good food should (I can't believe I wrote that in a review of the Waunakee Pizza Hut).  It's gotten so bad that lately the kids would rather have a bowl of Kraft mac and cheese instead of anything from the local Pizza Hut.

The crust:  A good crust should have some bite and chew, and serious flavor.  Pizza Hut fails to deliver on all three aspects.  The buttery crunch I remember has been replaced by greasy, limp and bland.

The sauce: It is way too sweet and lacks depth.  Think Ragu spaghetti sauce.  Actually, that may be an insult to Ragu.

The toppings:  They have really cut back on the quantity of the toppings over the years.  The pepperoni is cut razor thin and there is barely enough cheese to cover the sauce.  The texture of the cheese is off as well.  Just thinking about this is making me a little queasy.

From a service perspective, my biggest gripe that carryout and delivery times are rarely accurate.  I've learned to add about 10 minutes to the stated carryout time and 15 minutes for the stated delivery time. 

We rarely dine-in at the restaurant anymore, other than the occasional end of year sports banquet for one of the kids.  The restaurant is showing its age and really needs an update. 

Unless you have a coupon or order one of the specials, Pizza Hut is no longer the bargain it used to be.  For the same price, you can go to Zoe's or Doughboys in Waunakee and get a better pizza in a nicer setting.

So that pretty much covers it for today's rather depressing installment of the Waunakee Yelp Chronicles."}

{"text":"Awful service, waited on hold to order for 20 minutes, no one answered so I hung up. When I get here they say it's gonna take 30 minutes!! Maybe if you picked up the phone I wouldn't have to sit here with my activated and hungry child and wait for my pizza to be done."}
{"text":"Ordered pizza over the phone. The gentleman who took my order took forever.  After coming into Pizza Hut to pick up my order 20 minutes later - my order was to be finished at 6.08 it ended being another 20 minutes for my food to be ready.
Very nice and offered a liter of soda but come on folks - think I will another pizza company for my future orders. DISAPPOINTED"}
{"text":"Pizza Hut has been my favorite for years. Sadly it is not anymore. I ordered a pizza online with extra sauce and was delivered a pizza with less sauce than even the average amount. So I called and they re-delivered a pizza they thought would match the order for extra sauce. Sadly, it flopped again, and I was left with another unsatisfactory pizza. I have always loved Pizza Hut, so maybe I'll give them another shot, but not anytime soon. I do give them props for being able to attempt to fix my order."}
{"text":"Ordered fried cheese sticks and the sauce was completely watery ... I called and was promised a new sauce.... After waiting over 2hrs and accepted that I wasn't going to get anywhere... I called back and the the agent on the phone was starting their shift and didn't know of my situation. The overall customer service is horrible. The pizza crust tasted old and the fried sticks were not even hit upon arrival. I won't order here again...."}
{"text":"my order was placed at 7:17 per your e-mail confirmation. It said my pizza would be delivered by 8:10. It was 8:30 & still no pizza, so i called the store, no one answers, it goes straight to an automated system w/music. Does not allow to choose any numbers or options, i was on hold for 5 mins w/out anyone even answering the line. I hung up & called back to be on hold for another 5 minutes. Shannon answered to tell me oh it's with the driver, didn't even apologize that it had been over an hr & 20 mins. Pizza got here at 8:36 & cold! The driver says call store to complain & they will send another one. i said what for i just called & she didn't care! This is the worst service i have ever had! The womans name is SHANNON & the store manager is MARTIN! By the way, i still tipped the poor driver!"}

I get a call back 15 mins later and they tell me \" we can't do just 2 pizzas. Needs to be a dinner box, this isn't little Caesar's\"...... lol.... I hung up... no wonder Pizza Hut is going under... y'all suck"}
{"text":"Worst customer service! This is the worst Pizza Hut in Vegas from managers to workers!"}
{"text":"Not good pizza.  Would not recommend this pizza place. 
My pizza came delivered and it was unedible. 
I called and they delivered a new one. Even that one was not good."}
{"text":"Worst , the worst service ever in my life took them 45 minutes to prepare just a simple wings and still was not ready I had to ask for my money back their excuse was that they don't have enough employees will never come back here"}
{"text":"Terrible customer service. Went in to pick up some pizza but ended up waiting 10 minutes before anyone came to help me. Upon leaving I said thank you but never got anything back. If I could rate this place zero stars, I would."}
{"text":"This Pizza Hut is just a take-out location, no eat-in; they may do delivery also.  It's best if you call your order ahead and stop by to pick it up rather than dropping by. If you drop in and order, you'll need to wait about 15 minutes for your order. They have their best-selling pizzas and 2-liter sodas. 

They're on the corner in a busy, tight shopping area on N 16th Street."}
{"text":"Here is a tip for ordering your pizza online from pizza hut....DONT! Go some place else, anywhere else!! I ordered my pizza at 9am to be delivered at 11. I get that it's only an estimate  but my pizza arrived at 11:45 as I was leaving to take my kid to school! Beyond annoyed! When I called in to find out where my pizza was I was on hold over 10 mins to speak with a live rep, then they hung up, I called again was again on hold forever, when the girl finally answered she said my pizza left at 1105. ....it arrived COLD at my house at 1145! This is why I never order from pizza hut. So many better options out there"}
{"text":"These guys provide decent enough pizza, I like their pasta option, but - Man - when it comes to service (and even getting your order right) they totally suck!  

Take Dominos or Pizza 73 any day!"}
{"text":"Wing a ding a ling. The wings here are great.

1.  Wings!  They have wings here and they are of decent size, a nice light coating on it and very, flavorful sauce.   We tried the Garlic parmesan and the Spicy Asian style and the kids all devoured this.  The style was Traditional Wings.

2.  Pizza - Ordered the cheese and pepperoni here and it is quite edible. Would not say to die for, but edible.  

3.  Other bits - Ordered the Meaty Marinara Pasta that comes in a tray. Small tray, however, if you have other food, enough for 4 with small servings. It came with breadsticks which the kids also enjoyed.  Also had the fried cheese sticks and these went fast as well.

This place is not bad for the kids and a relatively inexpensive meal.  Although I prefer the pizza from Aurelio's or even Costco, this ain't bad.  For the wings, it is awesome."}
{"text":"This was the worst time ordering I normally order the stuff crust pizza from them and they just had on a new special with the pan pizza stuff crust worst thing ever biggest scam of money it's pretty much a pan pizza with extra cheese on half the pizza then they have the nerve to get lippy  on the phone"}
{"text":"The 1st time we ordered from here they REALLY jacked up our order. 2x. 
sad.  We let it go and just didnt go back. For about a year. 

Well recently since they lowered the prices of pizza and we had a coupon for one free medium single topping with purchase of LG speciality pizza. Both were really good this time around. They made it perfect and everyone was happy. 

The wings.. blah. I didnt like them @ all. Pass. (we ordered the Hot Traditional.. not impressed .. tried one.. blah. tried 2 jsut to make sure it wasnt just that one defective one... nope they werent good. 
This location is take out only."}
{"text":"I waited for 15 mins and no one came out to take the order when you still can hear the people talking inside, never coming back to check and see if i was waiting. There was also a bell on the door when it opens so I opened the door several times and no one still came up."}
{"text":"Forgot to put our pasta in the oven when we arrived to pick up a carry out order, gave us a free large pizza on our next trip without us complaining. Only had to wait 7mins for our pasta. Great initiative by staff."}
{"text":"They were very rude to my mother, young lady at the counter was unwilling to help, she said they were out of paper plates and could do nothing about a coupon I had via email for carry out only, because I had moved and it said it was only good for a specific store yet prior to ordering my carry out it took the coupon!! Just so rude and was very snooty! 
You'd think maybe I could get a ranch at no charge but nope! Good job! DONT WASTE YOUR TIME HERE!"}
{"text":"Ordered online.  Utilized the $10-for-any-pizza deal.  Ordered a hand-tossed, supreme minus the onions but add some black olives.  Went with the \"unflavored\" crust (which is pizza dough...which has flavor already).  Picked up the pizza at *13706 W Bell Road* in about 15-18 minutes.  Online order said 20 minutes.  Bonus!  Pizza delivery dudes walking in/out were friendly.  Order was ready behind the counter.  After a friendly chat, the $$$-to-pizza exchange was complete, and I was out the door.

I haven't had Pizza Hut in probably 4 years.  It's true that Pizza Hut isn't what it used to be, but you know what?  A lot of things are not.  That's reality.  Pizza Hut's still around, though I miss the restaurants that I remember fondly from my childhood.  That, and they used to serve beer.  And salad bars.  And pizza buffets.  And Book-It.

There are only a handful of dine-in Pizza Huts in the Phoenix Metro region.  My advice is to go there and eat.  Dine in.  Maybe if they still sell beer, then order yourself one and relax.

But I digress...

But I chose this Pizza Hut tonight to help keep them in business and also to give them a chance despite the low rating(s).

They did alright.  My pizza was hot, tasty, and non-greasy.  The toppings were loaded on there too.  What's to complain about?  The pizza was $10.95 out the door.  I can't complain much about something that tastes good, fills me up, brings back memories, and makes me happy for only $10.95.

Most people who complain got delivery.  Delivery is going to take a long time.  It always does.  Delivery drivers are also going to get lost.  They sometimes do.  Delivery drivers are going to go up and down your street 3 times before they finally see the correct yet non-lit address sign.  This happens all the time!  People that complain about Pizza Hut are just lazy.  If you want your food as fast as you can get it, then go pick it up!  Pizza in 18 minutes...or pizza in 90 minutes?

Thanks, and I'll be back..."}
{"text":"Seemed like there were 10 immature employees with lack of supervision. Pizza was actually decent. Won't spend my $$ there."}
{"text":"I was required to call and place my order because my condo was new. I was speaking with the first agent to place my order, then my call needed to be transferred to another agent for some unknown reason. Mind you the first agent cold transferred the call and I had to start all over, or so I thought! The second agent hung up on me when I began to speak. 

Clearly my business wasn't valuable enough. I would give a lower rating; however, this isn't possible. I will be buying pizza from another location as this wasn't my first attempt ordering from your store. 

Thanks for the pizza!"}
{"text":"Worst takeout (delivery) pizza I've ever had. I ordered a thin crust chicken pizza and salt and pepper wings. Both ended up in the trash. I completed a \"how did we do\" survey and explained how awful the food was, asked for follow up and never heard from them."}
{"text":"We had pizza parties at work, one for the night and day shift. 

We placed two different orders of twelve pizzas each, 24 pizzas for two different pick up times. 

We were concerned that they would mix the orders or not have them ready on time ready for pickup but to our surprise both orders were done correctly, the pick times were met, and the quality of the pizza was very good. 

At $10 a pizza the quality of the Pizza Hut taste is with out a doubt one of the best out there for the price."}
{"text":"I wouldn't even give this location one star. Every time I order from here I get cold pizza. I ordered online tonight and got a text stating my pizza was on its way. 30 minutes later still no pizza so I call to see what's going on and I'm told the pizza is on its way. I advised the manager that if the pizza was cold we would be sending it back. Another 10 minutes go by and the driver finally comes. That pizza was sitting in the delivery bag for 40 minutes! Of course our pizza is cold!!!  I call the manager and he stated he can send a new one out. Well after waiting for forever for the first pizza I wasn't about to order a second one. This has happened the last 3 times we ordered from this location. It is literally one mile from my house. How does it take 40 minutes to deliver a pizza when I am one mile away? Where did this driver go? I can drive to Chandler in less then 40 minutes!!  Do not use this location unless you want cold stale pizza. Also the manager is a joke and should find a new job where he doesn't have to deal with customers or be honest. Seriously this place gets negative stars from me"}
{"text":"First time having Pizza Hut in a while, this place sucks.  The cheese is melted but not melted together so it's like soft bits of individual pieces of shredded mozzarella.  Everything about the pizza we had was lousy. They say no one out pizzas the hut?  It's only a true statement cuz that's not a real word.  But if it were.  I think everyone else does. Get #1 Brother's.  Way better.  I give it 2 stars cuz it was 50% off ordering online."}
{"text":"I am not to happy with this location, I ordered pizza thinking it would be delivered fresh.

First thing was it took them nearly 2 hours to deliver and Pizza Hut sent me an email stating it was just going to be 45-60min. 
   Second, when the pizza was delivered it tasted like old pizza, as if it was sitting in the drivers car for awhile. 

Overall, not just they're service was terrible but the quality of pizza being made at this location isn't acceptable to me. 



8/5/2016 1:40pm
Tried giving them another shot and hopefully getting better customer service. Unfortunately nothing has changed ordered my food 11:57am I get the confirmation stating it will be delivered at 12:55 pm. I called the place at 1:00pm confirming if it was made and delivered, guy tells me they were waiting on driver. I call back at 1:30pm a lady with a rude attitude answers and I tell her the situation and told me the driver didn't have my unit number and my phone number was listed wrong on the order. They tell me they have to put in the order again and remake it. I figured through my name and me ordering there my information such as my email, previous number from last orders would be posted.  I'm just hungry and haven't gotten any good customer service"}
{"text":"Horrible. 
Estimated time. 1 hour. 
Time on arrival... Still pending!!!! It's been 2 hours. 
I would have came and picked it up myself if they would've told me THAT time frame. 
I understand if you're understaffed. 
But If that's the case call your customers and see if they'd rather come pick it up! 
K thanks."}
{"text":"Pizza arrived at time given upon order confirmation. There was a slight mix up with order upon delivery. I called once I caught the mistake and they corrected the order quickly. Nice service. 

Would order from them again."}
{"text":"Ordered traditional wings- Wednesdays are .60 cent a piece wings which runs cheaper than their other daily deals for the 8,12, & 24 count! We were able to choose 3 sauces (they will do one flavor for every 8 count ordered). The Sweet Chili was okay, Medium Hot was good & don't really recommend the Garlic Parmesan: super greasy sauce that is separated and you have to mix it up! Wings were average, but fairly saucy & were cooked through, but not really crunchy. 
*You have to pay for ranch/ blue cheese dressing .75 cents each??*
Ordered a personal pizza with up to 3 toppings: onion ( only one little sliver on each little slice) pepperoni & bacon hardly! 
The best thing was the cinnamon strips 10 pieces total with 1 dip of icing. Price wasn't bad & those were pretty tasty!"}
{"text":"If I could give 0 stars I would! Today was the first and last time I will be using this location. I first ordered pizza online for pick up then when I went to pick it up I had to wait about 20 minutes after the time they gave me. Then, I gave them a second chance and ordered desert for delivery (I had forgotten to order it and didn't want to leave the house again) I put my order in at 7:45 they said my order would be delivered about 8:20 but didn't arrive until 8:38. I live about a mile away so I don't understand why it could take so long. (Almost an hour) Then, I only tipped the delivery guy $2 because he was rude and it was 18 minutes late and he proceeded to tell me that the tip average was usually 20%. They are rude and they take way to long. I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS LOCATION!"}
{"text":"Worst pizza and wings ever!
Pizza was so greasy and overloaded with meatballs I couldn't even eat it.
The wings came with so much gunk of grease and butter that the bowl they delivered it in was half way filled with it. The wings taste like oil and were half the size of regular wings. Hands down the worst Pizza Hut ever!
Talked to manager his Name is Mike. He was about the most incompetent person ever. All he did was defend his nasty food that he couldn't even hear my complaints. He has no social skills and doesn't know how to listen. If you want a nasty greasy pizza and wings then this Crap Hole is for you!! Sorry my Grammer is so bad. All this nasty grease on my hands is making it hard to type and think. AVOID THIS PLACE. THE MANAGER IS A HUGE DOUCHE BAG!! FOOD SUCKS!"}
{"text":"This is the WORST PIZZA HUT that I've ever been to!!! I swear every time I order food, it always has chicken or bacon mixed in with the vegetables. Since being a vegetarian, I would think they would keep vegetables and meat seperate and far away from each other. I order out twice a week for my parents and this is what I have to put up with. Unprofessional staff who don't even know why they can't take a $50 bill, just because you have been ripped off before doesn't mean that everyone is the same. Put in some extra money and get the pens which are used to test fake bills. Just picked up my pizza after a 14 hour shift as soon as I get ready to eat my pizza I get a wonderfull surprise of chicken and green peppers embedded in my pizza when I strictly ordered Cheese with Jalepeno peppers. I called them back and CYNTHIA picked up, rude and unprofessional as their staff is didn't even justify and apologize for their stupid mistake and hung up the phone. I would rather go to Solon where the staff is amazing and my orders have never been wrong. This Southfate location is truly disgusting, unprofessional and garbage."}
{"text":"A little disappointed with the quality of our order today. We ordered 8 piece bone out wing. Flavor was amazing but the pizza was awful. Half of the pizza had no cheese or sauce. Very dry. My daughter didn't want to eat it. She never says no to pizza."}
{"text":"Does pizza hut differ from the midwest??? We ordered from this place one night and were so disgusted by what we had that we will never order again... 


hungry howies is better if you can believe that"}
{"text":"I'm sure that everyone knows Pizza Hut for the pizza, but there wings are usually good too, but today when I ordered my food, I requested my wings to be cooked well done so they would be Christ. Unfortunately my wing were not the way I requested, so I called the store on Craig Road and Decatur here in Las Vegas and spoke to Kyle. He says to me, if you want your chicken burnt we can burn it for you. WTF"}
{"text":"I have had to call several times and have talked to JAY about the drivers they have speeding in MY neighborhood.. I will never order from this location again it just doesn't seem like they care"}
{"text":"The worst customer service in the entire history of places! They should be in the garbage picking business and I am sure somehow they are going to mess that up as well. Sadly the workers and management is giving the franchise a bad name and are tarnishing it's reputation, the orders here are always wrong, late, and i am sure I have tasted CUM, SNOT, Buggers, and Pubic hair in it.

Hands down most horrifying experience of my life."}
{"text":"I recently moved to this side of town and I'm not sure why, but every time I order the stuffed crust pizza the middle of the actual pizza itself is extremely flat and hard. I thought maybe it was a one time thing but its been a couple of times now. Sometimes it's Not even cut properly and I'm essentially tearing the pizza apart. I don't know what the story is."}
{"text":"Who doesn't love pizza at least once a week?! 

I never used to be a Pizza Hut fan until this past New Years. They have a great option for families or even single or couples. I guess everyone I should say.

I always go straight for the $5 and under option. I get the create yourself one topping pizza and love how they have so many options from the crust to the sauce to the meats and the drizzle or no drizzles! And they have the pasta for a great portion size under $5 feeds two people. I usually get the chicken Alfredo pasta, it's delicious for. A fast paced pizza joint.

Only Down fall is the delivery guy NEVER had peppers or cheese packets EVER. So tonight I decided to carry out my order to get the packets from the actually building. Bad decision because guess what, they ran out of the packets too! Cmon your focus is pizza and that should include to not run out of the peppers or cheese. 

Overall love the pizza for a week day or weekend when you want to \"Netflix and chill\""}
{"text":"Pizza I ordered was good and delivered right on time. I also had ordered 4 20oz of Pepsi. When the delivery guy got to the house, he said they were out of Pepsi and had brought Mountain Dew and Brisk Tea instead. (I don't drink either one of those and neither does my husband). He said he tried to call, but I never had a missed call. Ended up just taking them since I had already pre-paid."}
{"text":"Walked in around 4pm and an employee walked in right behind me and immediately asked if she could help me. Took my order and told me the pizza would be ready in 15 minutes or less. 13 minutes later had my pizza and was heading home. Excellent service, I will be returning when I want another thin and crispy pizza."}
{"text":"Stop with your secret society password deals!!

Last few weeks Pizza Hut has a carryout deal called the Hut Lovers deal.
Which is a large two topping pizza for $7.99 carry out only.
The caveat is that you have to specifically say \"Hut Lovers deal\" in order to get that specific deal.
If you walk in and say \"what carry out specials do you have?\"
They will deny that they have any deals.

So yet again, after the Hut Lovers expired, they have a new deal called the \"Great Big Deal\"

I went in asking if they had any carryout deals.
Was specifically told \"we don't have any\"

But if you order using their app, the app will automatically tell you of the Great Big Deal.

So if you're coming in off the street or home from work and want a cheap carryout special make sure you utter their secret society password \"Great Big Deal\"

Seriously Pizza Hut?
How about next time before I pay for my pizza, you have to utter my secret password."}
{"text":"yay! I've always loved this Pizza Hut, been coming here since I was little. 

came today and it was just as i remembered it. pizza was good..those cheesy crusts and pan pizza :D

our server was great, she was attentive and gave us drink refills when we were getting low, and she got one of our orders wrong but she brought it to us knowing already and she had fixed it and told us it'd come soon and that we can have the wrong cheese pizza that they made for free if we wanted it!!!!!! hehehe that made me happy. she also auto-applied one of the coupons that we're going around at this time that we didn't know about :)

{"text":"I hadn't ordered from Pizza Hut in a verrry long time, after ordering today I remember why. This is a dead location, as in no customers ever maybe 3 people if so many. I ordered a dinner box with wings decided to do delivery. They said it will be 45 minutes. This location is 0.3 miles away from me yet a hour later and still waiting. Tried calling the store phone while sitting in front of the location. I watched as they all ignored the phone ringing. I already paid a 3.00 delivery fee, and honestly if I walked in the store I know it wouldn't go well from bad experience with very rude workers before. I came back in my home edit the sake of peace, my older brother was waiting on the porch still no food. I came home from an eight hour shift, followed by a 3 hour college lecture. From now on I will only order from Jets pizza, tastes better and never any worries."}

{"text":"Pizza Hut had a nice deal online - 2 mediums unlimited toppings for $14. I got the supreme and a primo meat. Both pizzas were loaded with toppings and made exactly the way I wanted.

{"text":"This Pizza Hut is quite possibly the worst service I have ever received.  This is the third time I have had issues with this particular store and the company as a whole has now forever lost a customer.  I ordered a pizza at 7:30 pm and it is now after 10 pm with no pizza in sight.  No one will answer the phone in the store, and a delivery driver has called me multiple times to delay his arrival.  What happened to my original one hour quoted delivery time? What type of pizza could possibly take over two hours? And if there are not enough drivers on hand to deliver pizzas in a reasonable amount of time, why are you accepting delivery orders at all? So many questions left unanswered along with so many mouths unfed. This type of service is just completely unacceptable. At this point I'm not even certain that a delivery will happen at all.   Needless to say I will be making sure to inform everyone around me of the plight I've endured through Pizza Hut from here on out anytime ordering a pizza is discussed."}
{"text":"This is the worst Pizza Hut ever. For starters it takes them at least 2 hours to deliver the food. Then when they deliver it most likely it's cold and incomplete. The Manager is unprofessional or shall I say ghetto and can careless about the food. Walk in the restaurant and it's disgusting. Definitely don't order from this place."}
{"text":"Part 2: 

This is the 2nd half of the previous experience I had with the manager at Pizza Hut located at 9614 Monroe Rd, Charlotte, NC 28270.

I called the pizza hut complaint line at 1-800-948-8488 to voice my complaint the 1st time about 3 weeks ago.  After speaking to the rep he assured me that someone would get back to me to discuss my complaint in 3-5 business days.  We'll that never happened. 

After 1 week I decided to call back.  I got a very nice young lady that I had to explain the entire siuation to over again.  Come to find out the first guy I spoke with put my complaint in as a policy issue which pizza hut doesn't address nor resond back too. This what she told me she saw he had notated from my 1st call.  Wowwww......

She escalated my complaint as \"sensitive\" and again I was assured that I would be contacted in 3 business days to voice my complaint to the district manager.  Of course that never happened.  

It's now been at least a month since this incident and still no response, action nor call back.  What's more, the manager at the location lied about his name to me when I made my initial call to the location to speak directly to him. He said his name was TONY but, in fact it's actually JOHN.  JOHN THE MORON....

If you did nothing wrong JOHN, have nothing to hide and stand by your decisions, why lie or lie about who you are or your name?  That's how you know he was in the wrong the day he racially profiled me in the parking lot as he put it, \"LOOKING SUSPICIOUS\".

Please don't visit or frequent this PIZZA HUT.  They are passing the buck on addressing this issue and need to be held accountable.  This manager thinks this is a joke and not taking it seriously when in reality ii really is.  

Sure I could side step this and let it go and normally I would.  Wouldn't be the first time I came across  another jerk who allowed his authority or position go to his head but, I feel very strongly that this young man doesn't get it and it will happen again, and again.  So no letting up."}
{"text":"This used to be a good pizza shop . In the last few years I've done something i never thought I would do and that is THROW OUT pizza.  Always from this store.

Today I returned a pizza because the crust was really bad - or it could have been the oil used on the crust because the taste was strongly rancid.  We partially ate only 2 pieces of the large pizza and then I drove all the way back to return it. 

This is the 2nd time I've had rancis crust there . Last time I was told the refrigeration system had been \"off\" for a while.

And GUESS what?  I paid $10 for the pizza and they do not refund - they give store credit only!  Which means, Pizza Hut got my $10, and they will \"repay\" me with a pizza that costs them a buck or two to make.  What a rip off."}
{"text":"This place is a rip off the pizza looked burnt and I paid $25 for 2 tiny pizzas I called thinking it was going to be what the price said it was online and when my brother went to pick it up it was ALOT MORE it doesn't mention anything about a coupon online or to mention anything at check out so they can apply it its just a deal but no coupon codes . Weird I've order once before at the the location in Phoenix and they've applied the deal without even asking."}
{"text":"Ordered food. Took HOURS. Called the store. They lied about no manager being in.
The person who answered the phone didn't greet me just yelled KEITH! When I called back the guy who answered the phone said there was NO way to know who answered the phone before. Really?
 Then he said he was sorry my order was two hours late AND wrong. There was nothing he could do about it but tell me to call tomorrow.
 I'll be going back to Little Caesar's!"}
{"text":"Do you know how hard it is to screw up pizza?
 Let's break it down by category: Ordering. I ordered online. Pretty basic. I am used to Domino's but felt pretty secure in my usage. Called the store after an hour to hear that they did not get my order. Really? Ok, Domino's did have that handy \"Track your order\" feature. Well, damn. An hour estimated time? I do admit she was spot on, within minutes of the quoted time. She wasn't particularly worried about the confusion, and acted like it. Since it was dinner rush it would be ANOTHER hour. Past my bedtime, but I agreed, mostly because I didn't know what was coming.
 So, delivery. The driver was very sweet, and put my pizzas down so I had a free hand to get sign, she did say \"Enjoy your Pizza Hut pizza!\". 
 The food, holy Christ. I ordered thin crust. I am pretty sure it was parchment paper, not because it was thin, but the taste and texture were absolutely parchment paper. Also, it was stone cold. The toppings, and the crust. I bit into it at one point just to have my girlfriend ask if my teeth were alright. It seriously was that crunchy. Totally tasteless. No hint of flour, even.
 They arrear to be making a lot of money on these Two for $7 each deals because they put about .45 cents of topping on each pizza.
 The sauce on the Alfredo one was like mud flour. It was apparent it was even there except I could see it. I could not feel it when I chewed though.
 The sausage was ok, had a faint sausage flavor. The Pepperoni was tasteless, I have no no idea how anyone makes pepperoni that doesn't have a taste, kudos to whoever did it. The ham on the pineapple pizza could have been something thin, pink and tasteless. The red sauce had a vaguely vinegar taste, and a jarred red sauce smell and taste.
 The veggies. Well, I hate black olives, and they were the best vegetable on there. Seriously. No joke, man. The pineapple was noneventful and I quote on that.
 I added hot peppers, and garlic powder to my slices and dutifully heated them up in the microwave, which violates a family disuse of due to my Grandson Kayden. Healthier to not, and his Mom is nervous about his pacemaker. After two bites I realized God was punishing me for that, and I will give it up again now, now more attempting to fix mistakes made by sloppy food delivery.
 I fed the dogs, and considered stealing some kibble, but it isn't a flavor that appeals to me. Next time I will get frozen pizzas to keep in the fridge. Either we were last on her 7 deliveries at once, or they weren't heated up by something silly like running them through the oven.
 Would have been two stars for her, but can't even justify the one I'm giving.
 The pics on this location that others have left in NO way reflect what you should expect on your, AT ALL.
 I wish they served beer or wine, then I could say at least they had beer or wine. Interesting that the 5 Star Reviews seem to be people with one review, and very few friends, with one or two exceptions."}
{"text":"I order here a lot. They always get my order right, AND find my house. Not an easy task.
 The pizza is good, never burnt or gooey, and I order online, they are nice if I need to call, but usually I don't.
 They don't offer red peppers or Parmesan Cheese anymore, which makes me a sad panda.
 All in all, glad they are nearby, and fast."}
{"text":"By reading the prior reviews, it appears that these people have never eaten at a Pizza Hut before. If you are expecting the best pizza you will ever eat, it isn't going to happen here. If you are expecting white glove service, it isn't going to happen here. If you are hoping for a quick, cheap lunch buffet featuring 6 different kinds of pizza, salad, breadsticks and something resembling pasta, then this is your place. For $8.99 including a beverage, I was in an out in less than 25 minutes and had a decent lunch. The pizza was warm and crisp and my waitress was there to clean plates and fill up my drink as needed. Definitely recommend for a quick lunch."}
{"text":"Ok, I first off want to say that I have had MUCH better experiences at Pizza Hut's than this one (for example the one on Turney Road I feel has been much more pleasant, but that is my honest and open opinion) but the food was prepared correctly and on time for my carryout order

    I had ordered from this Pizza Hut simply because of location to where we were going, a friend's parents house to fix up, clean and work on a few areas of the house.  We ordered some of their carryout specials and ended up with a nice deal around $21 for 2 large pizzas one of them being a supreme and the other a two-topping stuffed crust. 
    I first off have to say that I HATE Pizza Hut's OVERCHARGING policies!  By that, I mean they will charge $2 for Extra Cheese and if you want stuffed crust that's another $2 for a RIDICULOUS charge of $4 total!  So, if you are an avid cheese lover like myself that only wants to eat one or two pieces of pizza with extra cheese and stuffed crust then do NOT expect any discounts or deals because Pizza Huts EVERYWHERE in Ohio that I have visited charge the same amount for 'extras' involving cheese and you will pay for it.  This 'overcharging' as I call it is one of the SOLE reasons why I do not like buying from Pizza Hut and make it a rare occasion but they do make a decent Pizza and they do have nice deals from time to time.  
     As for the service, it could be much better.  First off, the small waiting room where I picked up my pizza was LOUD and it felt like people were cramming into the small room with only a few chairs and nothing else.  What made this visit a 'near' disaster was the employee who was the cashier came to the front carrying my pizza's in one hand to where they were being held vertically and not flat!  To top that off; When did Pizza Hut's stop using plates and handing out napkins??  There was a SMALL stack of napkins just sitting on the counter, exposed, next to the register so I was hesitant but when I asked for plates the same cashier actually laughed and said, \"Oh, we don't do that.\"  Okay then.  I paid and left. 
     Overall, if this is the closest Pizza Hut to you then I understand if you buy your pizza from this establishment but if you are looking for a better customer experience with your pizza then try the Turney Road Pizza Hut.  I'll probably go there instead."}
{"text":"We usually order delivery but very poor service, super cold pizza always, and one response all the time:\"we are super busy.\" seriously!!!!!
Hire some more employees people...."}
{"text":"I had a coupon for a large pizza for $11.99 so we decided to order delivery late one Saturday night.

The online ordering was a little more complicated than Papa John's, but I got the hang of it and managed to get all the toppings and apply the discount accordingly.

The website said over 2 hours for delivery which had me a little worried, but the delivery guy showed up in less than 45 minutes which was a relief.

The pizza itself was just alright. Again, this is pizza hut and one cannot expect it to be anything like Lou Malnati's or any of those other delicious places. However, it was pizza and we were very hungry. 

We got half cheese and half pepperoni and sausage. The pepperoni wasn't bad but the sausage was institutional-tasting, kind of gummy and not that good in my opinion. I actually ended up enjoying the plain cheese side more.

One deceptive thing about Pizza Hut is that their crust is huge. A significant part of the edge is crust alone, the diameter of the actual sauce/cheese/toppings is probably about 2'' less than the total diameter of the pie, which is good if you like crust but clearly seems as if it's a cost-cutting measure to use less sauce/cheese/toppings and more breading.

The pizza was $20 after delivery, tax and tip, which wasn't that bad considering the amount of food we got. Still, it's chain pizza and albeit I have a weakness for all pizza, I believe there are better options out there at the $10/person price point."}
{"text":"Terrible.
We ordered a large pizza, and wings for delivery.  The estimated delivery time was 45 minutes according to my online order.  Living in Liberty Village, I didn't think it would take that long as I could have walked to the store and back in 30 minutes.  It took almost 60 minutes to arrive!  I thought I'd give the delivery guy the benefit of the doubt, it was Saturday night at dinner time.  However, I asked him if they were busy, expecting him to say yes.  His answer...'No, not really'.
To make a bad experience worse, the food was bordering on cold.  
There are way too many pizza places to bother with this Pizza Hut.  Bad, slow, cold service!"}
{"text":"If you're going to order pizza from here, do delivery, that way you NEVER have to see them make your pizza or how the kitchen looks. We made this mistake for you! All workers were gloveless the entire time. We watched them touch their hair, their hats, their phones, their wallets and then made our pizza! Everything was a mess and a cook literally started stacking the pans on the floor because no one was washing anything! 

Mind you, this is after we came in from placing a phone order which was made incorrectly (two pizzas). They then remade the incorrect one (the clueless cashier thought we wanted one large two topping for the $7.99 promo and then a small for $7.59 - cause people love being ripped off...We wanted both on promo!) He then charged us for the correct and incorrect ones! Unfortunately we didn't notice until we got home because we were too distracted by everything else. Upon arriving home and still forcing ourselves to eat this pizza (should've walked out and hit up Cane's on the way back), we each only ate a piece before throwing it away. The pizza was (the corrected one and the original ones) doughy and fell apart when coming out of the box. SERIOUSLY...just don't bother, no matter how fancy this location looks from the outside!"}
{"text":"I am disappointed, though judging by previous reviews, not surprised to say that this location has failed repeatedly to uphold the standards of the company. We decided, against the advisement of previous reviewers, to give this location an opportunity to make us customers. Initially, the first time we ordered, our pizza was without sauce (or if there was sauce, it wasn't detectable) upon its arrival. We thought it was strange, but things happen, we chalked it up to an unfortunate night for that location, and let it go. A couple weeks later, we decided to give them a second chance. What do you know? The pizza was perfectly sauced... and it even had something extra... A large hair in the cheese. We contacted Pizza Hut, a little discouraged that we were let-down a second time by this location, and contacted the area supervisor who assured us that the situation could be remedied by giving us a credit. We accepted that solution, but the credit was never even applied to our account. Fast forward to tonight, we decided he \"third time would be a charm,\" made the decision we'd try to order from them again and explain that we knew a credit was theoretically in the process of being issued to us (bear in mind it has been a handful of days, so it should have been available to us at this point). What we received instead of a remedied situation or an issued credit, was attitude from the particular employee we spoke to. I WOULD name him, because he clearly had no interest in performing his customer service duties, but it IS the holiday season and I'd hate to see somebody lose their job at this time. Being in the customer service industry myself, I understand that sometimes things get frustrating, but I also understand as a customer service representative that I need to uphold the standards of my company. My point is this, it was a whole lot of trouble to go through just to see if we might finally get a pizza that had the proper portion of sauce without the health hazards of human hair on it. Not worth our time. Won't ever be ordering from here again."}
{"text":"If it were not for Nancy & Ritchie, this location would have received 1 Star. Jeff needs to be fired immediately. My son had placed an online order set to be delivered @ 3:21. At 4:10, I called the location & questioned where our order was. Jeff was a complete jerk. He told me that the driver attempted to deliver our order & an elderly couple answered & that the driver had waited for 20 minutes. If this did in fact happen (I am thinking Jeff is also a liar) the driver went to the WRONG door, why in the hell did you have your driver sit and wait for 20 minutes! I called Jeff out on it because nothing pisses me off more than to be lied to. He told me this was basically my fault for not giving the correct address & the order had been canceled. I will say, by this time my blood was boiling. A very nice lady got on the phone. Nancy apologized & between her & Ritchie, thank you both for going way above and beyond to make things right."}
{"text":"After running around all day doing errands I figured a quick pizza is what I need. Ordered online at 6:46 PM. I received an email verifying that my order is being made and delivery time will be at 7:50 PM. So no problem I'll wait even though I'm super hungry. I have a load of clothes to put in the washer that can distract my grumbling stomach. Before I continue I have to contact the store since there is no option of adding buffalo burning hot sauce. Whatever it's become routine. Plus I might be the only crazy one to order more of this type of sauce. However there is options for ranch, blue cheese, garlic, marinara, and honey BBQ dip sauces. It's very little options given that they have 8 different wing flavors. Anyway I call and get 2 extra buffalo burning hot sauce on the side added to my order. Now it's waiting time. 7:29 PM my cell phone rings it's the driver (Milo) letting me know he's outside. Cool he received my delivery instructions. All other drivers from Pizza Hut always fail me on this one. (Not a big deal I guess) Anyway he's very nice and friendly gives me my order tells me that the sauces are inside the box. I pay for the order, tip him, thank him and wish him a goodnight. As I shut the door I smelly the yummy pizza! My tastebuds are going crazy. I clean the table. Position my chair to start munchin. Then I get ready to open the boxes and guess what? Noooooo!!! My sauces.... are.... missing. (Sad face) I call the store at 7:47 PM and as I'm telling Hailey who answered the phone that I didn't receive my sauces she states let me get my manager for you. (Ummm hello?!? You there?? Ok I didn't ask for a manager, but I'll hold) she gets back on the phone and says my manager is currently busy can I take your number? I tell her I didn't ask for a manager that she was the one who was sending me over to her. I proceeded to tell her that all I want is my 2 sauces. Now I know your probably wondering what's the big deal it's just sauces. I'll tell you what the big deal is. First the wings come very dry 9/10 so I order extra sauces to add them. Also I eat the pizza with the sauce for me it's a pair that I can't separate. If the pizza is eaten alone it just doesn't do justice. Tastebuds get sad and depressed. Anyway you get the idea. So Hailey asks for my number and states that she will have the sauces sent over. I thank her then proceeded to wait. 8:22 PM (Milo) driver calls me and tells me he has my sauces. I run outside and tell him that I saw it on the receipt so I figured he thought the sauces were inside. He apologized and said he did see them on the receipt so he figured the kitchen staff put them inside boxes. I told him it's fine and thank him for bringing them to me. It's 8:44 PM I have my sauces, pizza and wings are cold. And to be honest I decided to just type up my review as I sit here watching my food. I don't know it's like a bitter sweet moment. Glad I received my sauces, but not as excited to devour my meal. I guess you can say my tastebuds shut down and are no longer in happy mood. I'm tired and hungry so I eat my meal. That's how I came to the conclusion of 3 stars instead of 5. Will I order from Pizza Hut again? Yes. Was it top notch customer service? No. Am I upset? No. Overall experience? Ok."}
{"text":"Worst Pizza Hut ever. Hands down. Came here after a hike so we were exhausted and starving. Walked in, a server was on the phone w a customer so we waited. That lasted for another 10 min, all the while I would've left but bf was staring and a lot more patient than me. Finally got seated, the server came and gave us the menus. He took our drink orders and left. After awhile, he came back with our drinks and proceeded to take our order, without writing down anything. We just ordered a serving of the honey sriracha breadsticks, and a large pizza with banana peppers, pineapple, chicken, and half with pepperoni. He never came back to refill our drinks, to the point where we had to flag him down and he did it. Never brought out the breadsticks, and when the pizza came, it was completely lukewarm and with the wrong pizza. No pineapples or chicken, the half pepperoni was correct, and although there were the requested banana peppers, there were also onions and green peppers, which the former the bf is allergic to, and had to remove them. Meanwhile, we wanted another refill of the drinks, and we got to the point where it was too ridiculous to wait that he actually got up and refilled the drink himself, the entire time no one even noticed. At all.  The place might have been understaffed, but it certainly didn't help when they also chose to converse among themselves, leaving a lot of the tables still dirty, and obviously customers unsatisfied. Bathroom was also filthy!!! Never again!!!! Would have been a lot nicer to buy a frozen pizza, at least it would actually have been hot from the oven!"}
{"text":"This Pizza Hut location is ridiculous on online orders. Order was submitted at 5:01pm for pick at 5:30. I arrived at 5:37 pizza was not ready. Had to wait an additional 15-20 minutes for a pizza that was ordered at 5:01 pm. Very bad service in my experience."}
{"text":"This location is a complete mess. We ordered a veggie pizza for delivery the first time and it arrived pretty much raw. The dough was completely uncooked. We contacted the location and they gave us credit for a future order.

Our second experiences was even worse! We called and called for over 30 minutes and no one ever picked up the phone. We finally drove over there to just order for pickup. There were 3 people working and the phone was ringing off the hook and NO ONE was paying attention to it. They quoted us 20 minutes...we waited almost an hour. Even worse, the pizza was raw AGAIN!

We were also disgusted to see that there were pans and other dishes all over the floor. The staff would pick them up off the floor and use them without so much as a wipe down."}
{"text":"Not ordering from this place again horrible customer service order took over an hour and my hot wing was mixed with some other flavor.... I think they just put hot sauce to other kind of chicken flavor gross  and my thin crust pizza was so could very unhappy"}
{"text":"Never had any problems with this Pizza Hut. Pizza is always good lots of deals and very fast delivery. Every time I've picked up in store they're very friendly and even give free sauces if I have to wait a little. Love this location."}
{"text":"Decided to make use of the promotion where you buy a large pizza at full price and any consecutive medium pizzas would be 5$ each.

Super Supreme Thin & crispy: Felt more like thin and chewy. very salty.
Meat lovers pizza: Very salty to the point that the salt was overwhelming all the other ingredients.
Ceasar Supreme: Again very salty and doughy. 

Customer service: pretty useless. I did the survey and asked to be contacted by the manager. It has been nearly 2 weeks and nothing. If pizza hut is good (coz it is the first time im having it), this location is the worst to represent it. I highly recommend other locations or another pizzeria. Atleast  Dominoes pizza truly holds themselves accountable for a bad experience with their pizza (your next order, regardless of the amount of toppings or size, is free)."}
{"text":"When someone places an order for a future delivery, come at the time specified. Because your driver came 45 mins early, I wasn't here at my parent's house to be able to write in a tip (I ordered online with a card). The pizza needed to be re-warmed for our party guests. The pizza tasted great as usual, however!"}
{"text":"Good service, nice employees. Pizza always tastes like pizza from the PH that was near my old house which was my favorite. Made in understandable time depending on time of day (can't expect 10 min on a dinner rush on Sunday football days, etc). Will be back!"}
{"text":"So I've had bad experiences in the past with this location but, because I grew up eating Pizza Hut, I tried to give them another chance. This was a terrible mistake that resulted in a full refund of my money. I will be honest in saying that the manager made an effort to rectify the situation, but at that point, it was too little too late. We ordered on a Friday night around 9p and was told that our order would be delivered within 35-45 minutes. I always add an extra 10 minutes, just because I know stuff happens sometimes. I ordered two pizzas, 6 wings, and cheese bread. Well an hour and 5 minutes later, our food was delivered and it looked as though it had been through a rough ride. All of our food containers were crushed, we only received 5 wings, 2 of which should've been tossed in the trash before even leaving the restaurant, and instead of cheese sticks like what's listed on the website, I received what looked like garlic bread that was picked up from the local grocery store and sprinkled with cheese. After bringing this to the manager's attention, she stated that I needed to specify cheese \"sticks\" instead of \"bread\" although there's only one option listed on the website. She did offer to give a store credit but I declined her offer because we've been given a credit in the past as a result of terrible service and they get no more chances from me. The next day, I went to pick up my refund in store and was \"greeted\" by 3 employees watching a video of a phone. They didn't bother to speak so I asked to speak to a manager. As the manager came out to assist me, I saw another employee in the kitchen preparing pizzas while holding her cellphone (which is definitely not sanitary), dancing around, and singing loud enough for me to hear her clearly in the dining room. Pizza Hut has taken a disappointing turn and is no longer the pizza chain that I remember from my childhood. Disappointing to say the least."}
{"text":"Had problem with website during order s o I called this store. The guy was very rude and hung up after suggesting I didn't know what I was doing. I won't order from pizza hut anymore since this is the only store in my area. Looking at the reviews, it appears people need to go elsewhere since they don't care and it seems to be the consensus of Pizza hut in general."}
{"text":"Absolutely terrible service. They purposely never pick up their phones, and unless the manager is in you can forget you're getting your food in a timely manner. I gave two stars however because the food is still decent. Not however impressed by the fact that the last time I went here they told me they didn't have enough 'dough' to make me a regular crusted pizza so they replaced it with thin crust and charged me the same price! Don't recommend this location, save yourself the trouble and go to the one on Hurontario and Eglinton."}
{"text":"Worst Pizza Hut of all time. Patrons beware. This is unfortunately the closest one to our house and ever since Pizza Hut launched their online $10/Pizza of the day, we began ordering more Pizza Hut the  ever before in life. Unfortunately, there are a slew of issues with this location and not once but a handful of times now, we have not received our orders. It's always one pathetic excuse after another. Staff explanations always end up reflecting something that is ultimately not the customers problem. And whenever they mess up, their only resolution is to offer 20% off your order. Last time, an hour after we ordered online, 15 minutes past expected delivery time, no pizza. They blamed an online ordering glitch (not my problem), and said that our pizzas actually hadn't been made yet because no driver was available (again, not my problem). FYI, your Pizza isn't prepared for delivery til a driver shows up at the store. How do you market and actively offer delivery as a feature, yet, the system is so faulty? It's not a Pizza Hut franchise issue, it's this location. Terrible customer service, and often the food isn't quite up to par either. Take some extra time and order from another location. That's what I do."}
{"text":"I placed a order for the meaty marinara pasta and the delivery driver gave it to me 55 minutes later the box was smashed and the pasta was everywhere"}
{"text":"Has to be the worst customer service of any pizza place in the country!.. placed an order 3 hours ago for 1 pizza.. online order said 75 minutes for delivery... called after 2 hours and after being put on hold I was told my pizza is next one to go out.. now an hour later still waiting .. place is only a mile away and im sorry no pizza place is that busy !!.. do ur self a favor and avoid this place at all costs.. Pizza Hut corporation should really look into this because according to all the other reviews his is a very common problem !!"}
{"text":"Terrible customer service from the lady answering the phone. Her bad attitude and poor communication skills makes me want to take my business elsewhere.  Decent customer service skills should be a REQUIREMENT. Would give her 0 stars if I could. Her name is Ashley! She seemed annoyed and unmotivated.

Aside from that, the pizza and wings were delicious and the delivery was very fast."}
{"text":"Took forever. Paper plates. No red pepper. Hair in my food. Phone rang off the hook. Dirty lobby and dinning room. Hmmmm, that seems like a fair assessment of what we had."}
{"text":"AVOID AT ALL COSTS! I ordered delivery online. Two hours go by, I call the store. A very rude gentleman named Paul answers and tells me my order was canceled. I told him I received an order confirmation, and have the number. He told me it was canceled from the call center, and it was their fault. I told him my credit card was charged, and he again shifted blame - all while being unbelievably rude. 

I don't care whose fault it was - it's silly that I was charged, got a confirmation email, and then no alert whatsoever that my order had been canceled.

Save yourself the stress - get Dominos. Or try Pizzazz on the Circle. Literally anything but here."}
{"text":"Food poison. My husband was sick after eating the wings. They were under cooked. Pizza Hut admitted this and sent a $60 gift card to our home. Do not order wings from here."}
{"text":"I'm completely done with this location. I order from them regularly and I've experienced a plethora of issues when ordering from them. Nothing too serious. But, the fermented marinara dipping sauce was the last straw.

The delivery drivers are always very courteous though."}
{"text":"BEST REMEDY FOR A HANGOVER!

I typically don't eat a lot of pizza but when I do, it's almost always Pizza Hut.  I love the grease and the moist bread.  This specific place is literally a hole in the wall.  No seating and not much standing room, however, it's never been busy everytime I visit.  Today we came by to buy a medium pepperoni pizza for 8 bucks.  We also have a discount from our company so everything came out to about $7.50.  The person who helped us was named Ashton.  He was good looking and super nice.  Told us it would take 10 minutes and it was really earlier than that.  

I know pizza is a sensitive issue for a lot of people.  For me, I'm a simple kind of guy.  Grew up on Pizza Hut and will continue eating Pizza Hut.  Since this place is so convenient from work, I'll definitely be coming back again."}
{"text":"Staff is usually pretty rude, pizza is usually not fully covered with cheese, if you call in an order advertised on tv or the internet they will not cater to it unless you order off of the internet( when they had the $5.55 pizzas the manager refused to give it to me I ordered it online and nothing was said when I arrived besides here is your pizza). Its good pizza if that is what youre in the mood for nothing different than any other pizza hut. Unlike the other two reviews I have yet to see this place dirty."}
{"text":"I should have listened to my intuition when I picked it up. They open the box and showed me the finessed most dad looking pizza I've ever seen I battled it but ended up excepting it and walking away with it now I'm eating it and it won't even stay straight so flimsy like cc pizza 15 years ago! Don't go to this location these guys don't give a shit about the pizza they're making, Go to the one off Sunset and Fort Apache"}
{"text":"Hello friends,

This fine Pizza Hut is located in a small strip mall. That had a soul food place, a gas station and some other something. It was football night and my buddy was buying..sooooooo fast food pizza it was.

This has to be the smallest business I've ever seen. All i could keep thinking to myself is, \"wow, this is what a sweatshop looks like\" . It's carry out or delivery ONLY. 

As for the pizza, it was good considering. It also helps that we picked it up so it was pretty hot. It looks janky on the outside & it's pretty small on the inside and looks like it could stand a good washing. That's my reason for the low star rating."}
{"text":"This Pizza Hut always takes FOREVER to deliver! Also the cheese sticks I ordered had to of been sitting under the light for quite some time because they were crunchy and overdone. The cookie pie on the other hand my son is pleased with."}
{"text":"Amazing service! An lady took my ordered I just wanted a personal pizza and she gave me a medium for the same price since they were out of personal ones. She was very friendly and welcoming."}
{"text":"I will almost always choose Pizza Hut over the competitors mostly because of the pizza, but this one specifically because of the service I get when I do order. Their promise times are always spot on if not ahead of time!"}
{"text":"I ordered pizza from this location recently. When I went in to pick up the pizza, I waited for about 10-15 minutes before anyone even acknowledged that I was there. I was the only customer in the store, they were just simply ignoring me. There were two people in the back that saw me several times, yet never even stopped to say, \"We'll be with you in a minute\", they just ignroed me. About 10 minutes into my wait the cashier/front store clerk came in through the back door with a handful of scratch off lottery tickets that he obviously just bought, and rather than put them down to ring me up when he saw me, he also pretended as if I wasn't there and walked off somewhere, I assume, to scratch his lottery tickets.  Needless to say, I will never be going here again."}
{"text":"I used to live in New York, and I can say with confidence that Pizza Hut on the East Coast is loads better in quality than PH on the West. Regardless, I have definitely had better pizza in general than any Pizza Hut in the US, anyways, so this review is going to be more about the service. 

Service: 2 - Feeling lazy one Saturday night, we ordered our Pizza online with some garlic sauce to boot. 

They ended up calling about 2 minutes after we sent the order to make sure that we actually ordered. If they're going to do that, they should just get rid of online ordering and prompt everyone to make a phone call! It would be much easier on their end.

When we arrived at the time that they said it would be ready over the phone, the pizza was ~not~ ready. They continued to state while we were waiting that the \"real reason\" they called was because they were out of garlic sauce...then why didn't you mention that over the phone? Another 8-10 minutes later, we had a pizza to take home!

Poor organization and failure to make a pick-up deadline for a just-okay pizza. Service is slow and confusing--better avoid! Happy food hunting :)"}
{"text":"Every time I've ordered it has been on time and freshly made which I appreciate rather than a premade pizza.. the place is a little small but since they take orders quickly I've never seen it too packed. I'd recommend calling ahead their ETAs have been pretty accurate in my cases. They also honor Groupon coupons which was awesome. Some of their toppings prices don't make sense to me which is why I rate 4 stars."}
{"text":"Horrible!  Won't even deliver to my house which is only 5 miles down the street!!  We'll stick with Marios which gladly delivers to me 10 miles away!!! I see this location going out of business real soon."}
{"text":"I would never recommend this Pizza Hut to anyone! We placed an online order recently. It was brought to us within 30 minutes, but we realized an order of breadsticks had been left off when we started opening the boxes. I called and was told that it would be at least another 30 minutes before the breadsticks could be delivered. I was put on hold multiple times and hung up on once by an employee who lied and said she was \"new.\" The manager finally came on the line, apologized but sounded very insincere and short. The level of customer service at this location is unacceptable. They all need to take a field trip to the local Chick-Fil-A to get some tips on how to run a business and treat customers!"}
{"text":"When finding this location on Yelp to do my own review. I saw the overall reviews for this place don't seem really good, so I feel fortunate my visit here was decent. This review is coming from someone who was a Pizza Hut manager for 2 plus years in Hawaii, so you might find my review more relevant. Or less! haha!
Hard to beat the price at $5.99. It does cost $1.99 extra for a soft drink & $0.99 if you wanted a salad. The restaurant was reasonably clean and busy too. Good thing about it being busy is that it keeps a steady stream of hot and fresh pizzas coming. The setup I found a tad peculiar is that there is a partition that separates the dining area in two. Maybe that's to split the buffet and non-buffet diners? I don't know. We were seated promptly and had a very nice waitress that kept our drinks filled and even brought some supreme pizza directly to the table after I had asked if they could make some. The pizzas, breadsticks & pasta tasted about what I'm used to from Pizza Hut. Since it was neither amazing or horrible I was gonna give it 3 stars but the great service, I had to bump it up to 4."}
{"text":"I've ordered pizza for carryout a couple times here since I moved here. Haven't had any problems with service or the food.
A couple weeks ago when some friends were visiting from out of town. We wanted to find something fast at night to eat and we could take back to the hotel. We decided to order online via a friend's phone on our way out after watching MNF on the strip.
So, while we were picking up the pizza. One of my friends had to use the bathroom really, really badly and we couldn't find anything open in that strip mall(it was near closing). Even though he didn't have to, the manager was nice enough to let her use their employee bathroom so she wouldn't have to pee right in their lobby."}
{"text":"Subpar pizza and service at its best.  I called in an order to go on my drive home one rainy night earlier this month.  I ordered one of their dinner boxes for my family of four for twenty bucks.  Great idea and price, but terrible execution.  The \"pizza\" in the box is basically a square of dough which I suspect they use for their bread and cheese sticks with sauce and cheese on top of it.  They do not spread the sauce and cheese to the corners of the dough so unless you get a middle piece, you are just getting an over cooked piece of bread.  The service was just meh.  I walked in and stood there for probably 5-7 minutes before anyone said anything to me.  Several people walked back and forth behind the counter until I was finally greeted.  Very lackluster experience.  I won't be back."}
{"text":"The worse service you can ever get. I ordered pasta and wings for delivery on 8/8/17 at 8 pm and called them at 9 to ask why the delivery hasn't showed up yet? They said the order was for carry out. I went there to pick it myself, and they said we cancelled your order. That is BS. Fenton, the store manager didn't even apologize for inconvenience. I will never ever call Pizza Hut. Papa john is the same cost, good quality food and best service."}
{"text":"The fact that these guys are close and I have been a fan for years of that deep dish meat lovers pizza, oh my goodness just makes my mouth water thinking about it.  I haven't had a bad experience yet and it would have to be a huge one for me to break ties with them."}
{"text":"Employees who answer phone are extremely rude. It's pathetic they can't be courteous and polite to customers placing orders which in turn help them have a job! If you're so miserable, go get another job!"}
{"text":"This is the worst Pizza Hut ever! I ordered my food and it was delivered late, cold, and the entire order was wrong. I tried to call and speak with the manager but nobody answered the phone. I called corporate to leave a complaint and they offered a free pizza to which at that point I just wanted a refund. They said I'd be contacted within 3 days by upper management but nobody contacted me. I went by the store to share my experience but was met by the manager they called Lopez. He was very rude, dismissive, and nonchalant. I will never patronize this store again!"}
{"text":"Pay attention.

So the Mrs. placed an online order. The process was easy. Instead of delivery, we decided to have it picked up. Called into the location and told them I wanted to come in myself. After giving me and my wifes name the order was found, ( wow not organized at all ) . \"Yes you can pick it up.\" Mind you, the new order total at the time with delivery charge is $19 and some change. 

1830 I showed up to pick up. What do you know, couldn't find me again, so I looked up the confirmation. Yup there I am, and guess what, the driver is on his way to deliver the order.

WOW REALLY?!!

So I waited for him to come back. \"It's Sunday, so stay calm Mikey.\" So the driver comes back and I'm shown my ordered pizzas. Ok they're good. Time to pay.  $32 and some change is the total. !!!!!WHAAAT!!!!? Ok explain. \"Well the previous total was for delivery only. Since it was changed to pick up, the deal does not apply.\" GEEEZ!! RAAAAGE!!! PEE OWED!! is whats going on inside of me, but in the outside, \"So then thats it?\" Yup pretty much. All I got was a \"I'm sorry that happened.\" When all they had to do was honor it. You couldn't find the order, you had me wait for your driver, and you upcharge me for coming myself to pick it up?!! REALLY!!!?? .. You know what, I'll cook. 

There's a reason why your customers are not happy or satisfied with you guys. Check the reviews. Pay a freakin attention. 

Waste of time. There's a Domino's down the street, or even Rossotis. It's bad enough I saw one of your cooks dropping food in the back kitchen area. Yes, the one with the bangs hanging from the front of his hat. Dropped a chicken wing while putting it in the order basket. Ask him what he did with it. 

Sorry I can not give 0 stars. They deserve it."}
{"text":"Excellent service. If they even think they dropped the ball they'll hook you up,  real quick. It's like pulling teeth with alot of places that's goofed up your order really bad! Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"Perfect Order!!  Ordered 2 medium pizzas for $6.99 each anyway you want it.  Both were thin crust - 1 was extra pepperoni and the other was MY way.  I start with a supreme but remove items I don't like and add what I do.  This pizza was perfect!

Ordered Honey BBQ chicken wings ~ they were delicious!!

Dessert is upcoming ~ chocolate chip cookie

EVERYTHING WAS GREAT!"}
{"text":"I haven't ordered from pizza hut in months, but saw the commercial for cheesy bacon stuffed crust and thought I'd give it a try. The service was good and delivery arrived in a timely manner. My order was correct, but the food was disgusting. Cheesesticks were very overcooked and dry. (These are usually amazing when cooked correctly.) Pizza was also overcooked and lukewarm upon arrival. My kids wouldn't even eat it! I won't be wasting my money here again."}
{"text":"First time ordering here just b/c I was in the area. My order was ready at 7 just like they said it'd be via carryout and my pizza was bomb.com    happy fat gal."}
{"text":"I finally decided to give Pizza Hut a shot after staying away for years..and I remembered why I had. The prices are absolutely ludicrous! 
Luckily, I went on a Tuesday which was the deal day for pepperoni pizza - Medium or Large for $10 (online orders only). I got a large pan pizza, although when I got it, it was SO small! It was in a large box, sure, but there was tons of room surrounding the pizza so I'm doubtful that it was 14\" as it should've been. If I had paid regular price for this pie, I would have gone bonkers...$21 for a 14\" pepperoni pizza? Does the sauce have gold bits in it? Even the personal pan pizzas are insanely priced at about $6.99 for a pepperoni...I don't understand how they stay in business.
The pizza itself was ok, cooked fine and a little greasy (as per usual Pizza Hut fare) but hella tiny. I might go back if I win the lottery or something...otherwise I will stick to the local pizza joints in the area instead!
The guy at the counter was nice, and suggested doing the online order when I was in store with my mouth gaping open, staring at the prices in horror...that was helpful advice seeing as I was about to leave. :)"}
{"text":"2nd time that we're waiting more than 1.5 hrs for our order of 2 medium pizzas. Already 30 minutes past the time of our order confirmation. We ordered at 5:20pm and it's now 7 pm and we're still waiting. Not good. Too bad, bc we love the pizza, but we won't order again. It takes too long."}
{"text":"Had a couple of times where the food tasted and smelled weird. It takes a long time for delivery. I will say that every time I had a problem tho, they did work hard to resolve the issue."}
{"text":"I absolutely love Pizza Hut! My personal favorite is what we would call in the Philippines as a Hawaiian pizza, a regular Pan pizza with pepperoni, ham and pineapple. 

I've ordered a few times from this particular location before and they have been awesome. All the workers have been nice and attentive.

I think my Hawaiian pizza works best with a medium size as opposed to the large because pineapples might add a more wet component to the pizza? It was still so good, though. 

I always place my order online using a coupon from Retailmenot.com, get dressed, drive over to pick up my order, drive home and enjoy! Easy peasy!"}
{"text":"Super slow! They quoted me a 15 minute ready time and it took almost an hour. It wasn't even busy in the restaurant for them to be that slow. Food was your typical Pizza Hut so pretty good, but what you expect from Pizza Hut."}
{"text":"Staff were friendly and helpful even though call centre put the wrong name on our order!  Thankfully the phone number matched and they brought our large Supreme pan pizza from the warming oven which is nicer than just sitting on an oven like most places.

It's not gourmet but sometimes I get nostalgia for pizza from my childhood!"}
{"text":"Standard Pizza Hut experience.  Definitely worth adding to the rotation considering the limited delivery options in Tatum Ranch."}
{"text":"When you come in Pizza Hut at 11:44 am here at southern Highlands to order food , you can't disturb the cashier on the phone talking to his bank about personal stuff , it rude. So after 10 min of waiting till he finish his business on the phone , I ordered  a med cheese pizza that will be done in 15 min. If he rang my pizza First and talk to phone for 10 min, that would be ok, but of course this guys are so educated and loving there job, a can't disturb them. Amen."}
{"text":"It kinda seems silly to review a Pizza Hut since they're basically on every corner, but I hadn't ordered it in a long time until today and it was really good. 

The pie we ordered was of the pan variety and it was sooooo delish.  The crust is buttery and crispy, making this pizza waaaay better than any of the other crust options.

If you haven't had it in awhile, try the pan pizza, you'll be glad you did!"}
{"text":"I've ordered online a couple times from there every single time it was wrong and/or they something! I called to tell them they basically said it was nothing they could do for me. Wtffff worst Pizza Hut I've ever been to or ordered from by far"}
{"text":"NEVER MAKE THE MISTAKE OF ORDERING FROM THIS PIZZA HUT. I ordered online and immediately the site told me the pizza was going to take 3 hours. I called and wanted to cancel the order but they assured me it would be delivered within an hour. 3 hours later I was still waiting for my pizza...I tried calling multiple times during the wait and they stopped picking up my calls until I called with a different number. For a whole hour they kept telling me that the driver had already left with the pizza, which is ridiculous because I only live 5 minutes away from the store. I tried to talk the manager but he or she was \"so busy\" that they would have to call me back....I'm still waiting for that call. WORST SERVICE I HAVE EVER SEEN. This pizza hut doesn't deserve to stay open. One star is too much for them."}
{"text":"Awful. Three strikes, and done. Not only is the customer service beyond sad, but the food... I should just say, if not paying the $2 delivery charge and not getting the $.50/pc sauces mean I'll actually get hot food, then I'm okay with it. If not, I won't ever order again. 

Surcharge after surcharge, less service, and more rudeness from the drivers. If I wanted under cooked or cold pizza, I would get the grocery store kind and set my oven too low.

The new menu was a reason to try again, and yet still, the order comes wrong. The two medium pizza deal meant swapping crust and sauce, toppings and all, and not hot. Two tries on two pizzas and still didn't get one correct. I'm tired of paying a delivery charge, and tax, and tip, for rude drivers, incorrect orders, and missing items. 

Last time this place will get an order from me. 

Fool me thrice..."}
{"text":"I was just trying to order on line large pizza and they have spacial  large pizza $7.99 with $2.00 extre for stuff crust with the total of $9.99 and we were not able to place our order because our order was 0.01 ( penny) short. We called the store and spoke to Augusto and he said we can't place on line order because of 0.01 short. I ask to speak with store manager but it took him more than 10 min to let me speak with assistant manager Nicol ,she was no help instead she was so rude to me,her answer was she had other customers to help and she hang up phone on me. If this kind of service this store is giving I don't know how they will stay in business. Very poor customer service"}
{"text":"Meh.  The only closer pizza places to my house are Little Caeser's and Rush Street Pizza.

I've tried Rush Street and it doesn't cut it. Little Caeser's? That is only for little kids birthday parties and gatherings of high school kids when you need a bunch of pizza cheap.

If I go another 5 miles or so I can get Grimaldi's (good but pricey) or Venezia's (also good but pricey).

So what do you know...Pizza Hut gets a try with the $5.99 medium pizza's with up to three toppings.

It was better than I expected, I must say. I didn't expect much though."}
{"text":"Where is the negative star option? I ordered extra ranch and after pizza was delivered I got a hand written note stating that ranch is not free, .75 extra. I would've paid. I ask manager Chelsea if someone had called me to advise, she said she didn't know and that many employees were out and about. BUT, she could have ranch delivered for a fee. Not impressed. Will NEVER order from that store again. HORRIBLE! customer service."}
{"text":"I ordered two ranches with my dinner box, and they weren't given to us when we left the store, nor on our receipt even though it was on my online confirmation. Had to go back inside to get them. Then, come home to realize the crust was plain instead of garlic like we ordered. Total waste of 14 bucks."}

{"text":"We ordered pizza for our daughter. The pizza was hot and tasted fresh. They also thee in free breadsticks because we were the last customers of the day. That was really nice of them!"}
{"text":"I usually really love pizza hut but this one really freaking sucks. I spent over 80 bucks on 3 large pizzas and a small cheese pizza, yet the \"large\" slices were extremely tiny, sour and undercooked. I know I ordered about 15 minutes before they closed but come on... That was completely unacceptable. Would never recommend this location."}
{"text":"On the occasion that I order from Pizza Hut they never disappoint me. Pizza is always done good. Though if you're looking for a pizza place to sit and eat with a group of friends this won't be the place for you. As they don't offer seating at this location. Their friendly staff is always a bonus."}
{"text":"Alright, so Pizza Hut is cool in my book because it has stuffed crust pizza. I honestly was expecting an average experience, but the pizza we ordered tasted much better than I thought it would be. A large pizza is enough to satiate the hunger of two grown adults."}
{"text":"It re-opened my friends.. and it is still as disgusting as ever. The employees hate their lives and everyone trying to enjoy the pizza....which is never because I'm sure the shoeless man who walked in and stared at everyone's feet tasted better then the pizza I ingested."}
{"text":"Whoever the female was took my delivery order on 8/4/15 at 7:15pm was horrible. She made fun of the street I live on with another co-worker as I heard her clearly. She failed to get my order right after repeating myself multiple times, different ways hoping she'd grasp comprehension. The employee wasn't taking the time to listen to what I wanted to order. She asked if I wanted a drink with my order after I told her moments prior, \"a 2 liter Diet Pepsi\". While writing this review, I got a call from another female employee saying they are out of 1 of the things I ordered. Why isn't the staff on point with what they have and don't have available to customers? Why did I have to repeat credit card # 4 times over, security code twice? I asked the female that took my order, \"Are you OK?!\" 

I am management at a restaurant downtown Madison. If she were my employee, I would've sent her home with a copy of her write up. Her actions an poor customer service is unacceptable and I'm letting it be known.. The staff needs to utilize www.360training.com to enhance their job performance and customer service skills. I'm thoroughly disgusted...."}

I was told another 5 minutes which turned into another 15 minutes .After waiting an extra 20 minutes for our order I asked for two dipping sauces , they proceeded to charge me approx. $1.20 for the sauce. I feel for our wait they could have gave us those and a discount but nada.Not the best customer service."}

Amazing pizza 
Good service

I can't understand the bad reviews 

It's f'in pizza. It goes through a heated conveyor belt !!! 

People too drama. 

Pizza is great. Greasy, thick, delicious


Always Great

Delivery is decent ... I prefer picking up"}
{"text":"Interesting that incorrectly making an order I'd already paid for that looked inedible I was asked only if I wanted credit or to wait for 20 min not free delivery or a refund as I'm only 2min away. Find the other pizza joints in the area, I'll not be back."}
{"text":"Haven't eaten Pizza Hut in years and it was pretty good, nothing like it use to be in the 80's nice greasy and delicious! Lol! This location has obviously been around since the 80's so if your not concerned about ambiance I would recommend. The silver ware needs to be looked at before use it, we went through a few before we got a clean fork and napkin together, the booth had a huge hole in the seat and the carpet needed to be replaced. Like I said it's been around for a while with little to no updating. Again... The pizza was good the cheese breadsticks were delicious. Water tasted like toilet water which the server agreed but they did have bottled water! The server was nice forgetful but nice."}
{"text":"Wow! I'm the first one to review this place. This place gets a 2 star out of 5. Lets talk about the food first. It's pretty good and tasteful. There is a bit of a wait to get your order though. The pizza is always good and the crust is excellent. The boneless buffalo wings are very good too, with a few different choices for the sauce. As for the salad bar, that could use alot of attention (not the cleanest or greatest).

As for the building itself. The staff could take some pride in making sure that it's cleaned properly. I was there with my family last Sunday 01/29/2012 and they had at least 4 tables that needed cleaning. They all had dirty dishes and it just didn't look like the staff even cared. If they can take care of that issue, this place would be a nice place to eat at."}
{"text":"My rating is 3.5 stars. 

Many moons ago, I had a choice between going to the Pizza Hut that used to be at Midland and Finch, or Highway 7 and McCowan. The former has been closed for years. The latter is still alive and kicking. 

A few years ago, this Pizza Hut opened, which is even closer to my home than the old one. I told my parents about it. 

After visiting the Peterborough Veg Fest, it seems hilarious that I would have dinner with my parents and gorge on all meat choices. They ordered two medium pizzas in the lovers series: meat and supreme. They also got honey garlic wings. 

The wings are decent. You can't taste the garlic, so you may be disappointed if you can't ward off vampire and evil spirits afterwards. 

Next to Little Caesars, I love pan pizza from Pizza Hut. I don't mind the oiliness now and again. It's yummy. 

The store is clean whenever I'm there. I'm glad that it's a five-minute drive away.

{"text":"Googlin', Yellow Paging, and even Pizzahut.com'in........Where the hell is your phone number. I know this PizzaHut hasn't gone out of business because I live 2 blocks away from it and yet surprisingly the phone number isn't listed anywhere.  This is the one on Buffalo and Blue Diamond Rd.

I just decided to go drive there instead of making a phone order and asked why they aren't listed on the internet and they said its not the first they've been asked about this.  They have no answer to why but it didn't matter and I just wasted my time because they don't even deliver, haha. 

With that aside, the lady that was serving me was very friendly and gave me a fridge magnet with the phone number on it.  I don't usually go to pizzahut to buy pizza but decided to add it on with my orders of 44 piece wings since a large with 3 toppings was only $10 and the wings were $25 for 44 piece. Very good deal.

Maybe it's just me but I regret ordering the hottest flavor for the wings because I freaking couldn't handle it.  Wings were good though but just too hot for my taste so my lil' 15yr old bratty brother showed me up by eating all of it. I'd def come here for the wings but as far as pizzas goes, damn it tasted like a $10 large pizza.  I ordered the hawaiin toppings which was pineapple, sausage, with pepperoni.  The taste was very bland and nothing, even a tad bit to tickle my taste bud. But thats what I get for being cheap that day instead of going to my fav local joint, Familia Pizzeria.

Pizzas at PizzaHut, lesson learned."}
{"text":"Ordered carry out online here, the food was made fairly quick which is why I'm giving a 1 star, but make sure you receive everything you paid for on your receipt, because they charge for stuff they forget to give you and the customer service is poor and the manager that helped me was not helpful nor cared that I drove back from my house. Staff is FORGETFUL and robotic. I approached the counter and the same guy that FORGOT to give me my item asked what I wanted to order. Like cmon bro you can't be that forgetful, you just saw me a few moments ago and just got off the phone with me.. 

I'm not returning back here again and that's a fact..and how about we make it even, I'll be the forgetful one this time, because this Pizza Hut app I got, that I just forgot about, just got deleted *"}
{"text":"Just moved in a couple months ago to this area and was hesitant about ordering from this location because of all the bad reviews.. another rainy weekend and we weren't in the mood to cook so we figured we'd give this location a try. This location EXCEEDED OUR EXPECTATIONS! There was a glitch ordering online (wouldn't give me the option to order a large) so I had to call in the order. The girl who took my order was SO HELPFUL! I forgot to get her name but I believe her name was Alicia (at least that's what's on the receipt). She not only pleasantly took my order but also apologized for the glitch online and gave me the online deal! Delivery time said 25-35 min. but I'm pretty sure it was not longer than 15-20 min. until we received our order, by Alicia!! Fast, excellent service!! The pizza was also perfectly cooked! Really pleased and impressed! We will be ordering from you guys again. Thanks, Alicia (I really hope that's your name)!! Give this girl a raise!!"}

I order 1 pizza and boneless BBQ wings , the wait was about an hour which I thought maybe they are busy so ok. An hour pass by I called them to ask where my order was and they told me the driver was out with my order and would be there shortly. Another 30 mins pass by still nothing so I called to cancel. I order the pizza at about 8:45.. around 10:55 I get a call saying my pizza was outside . I told the driver I canceled my order but no one told him. I than called corporate which they told me I should have my refund within 3 business days and still nothing . Never will I ever eat there again!!!"}

Gave me the wrong pasta, pizza has no cheese."}
{"text":"Always had ok to good service here. They permanently closed their drive thru. Not sure why, my theory is the wait time for cooking the pizza. I remember back in high school days, we would be waiting at least 10 mins in drive thru. Better to call ahead and order for pick if not dining in."}
{"text":"2016 Yelp 100 Review Challenge - 24/100

I don't usually write reviews for chain restaurants. The reason for this review is the service. I always recognize and praise amazing customer service whenever I can. I feel people should be appreciated especially when they work in the service industry. It's a tough job dealing with customers with minimal pay. With that being said, I was here over the weekend with family while in Boulder City. This is the one chain restaurant we come back to often while in Boulder City. 

We ordered appetizers because most of us weren't that hungry but some of us were. We ordered boneless chicken wings (sauce on the side), bone-in wings (sauce on the side), Hershey's brownie with chocolate chips, bread sticks and a personal pan pizza. Everything was great. We got everything we ordered in a timely manner. 

The main thing I remember about this place is the service. It was about 2pm on Saturday, with 5 other families in the restaurant and only ONE waitress, who was only on her 1st week of working there and she handled it like a pro. I don't remember her name, but if the manager does see this, I hope they know that she did a amazing job, she stayed positive and worked hard even though she was the only one on the floor."}
{"text":"Placed an order today, and the email said that it would take 39 minutes. An hour later, the delivery still wasn't here, so I called the shop just to see what was going on. The first thing that the young lady said to me when I told her that I was checking on it was \"oh my god\". She made it seem like I was a burden on her. She then said that they were just busy and to call back if I wasn't happy with the order. When the delivery guy showed up about 15 mins after that, I told him that he needs to tell his manager that he shouldn't have people talking to customers like that. He kept apologizing and saying that she was 17 and it was her first job. Common sense would tell anyone not to say \"oh my god\" to customers. I will never deal with this place again. Food was cold by the time it got here too."}
{"text":"Dirty tables and bland pizza.  A few tables with paper towel rolls and those were dirty too.  So many more options than Pizza Hut.  Pizza Hut is a restaurant destroyed by franchise and quality sold out to shareholders."}
{"text":"Refuses to honor coupons or specials advertised on television.

I seriously thought that owning a franchise and paying the ad fee and the franchise fee made it so the business was bound to honor these things. Apparently I was very wrong, as this franchise chooses not to do that. I go ahead and go to one of the Pizza Hut's in Kent or in Munroe Falls. they have no problem taking my money!"}
{"text":"I've been to this Pizza Hut twice now and honestly I think the 2 stars isn't fair. 

The problem is they seem to be being micro-managed.  They have no decision making power even as managers. I came in with free coupons.  Granted, I got them out of state there is no fine print that shows or states that they are limited to corporate or franchise locations or anything like that.  they're old so they're not used to seeing them.  Both times now I've had to argue with them on their validity. They are in fact issued from PH in New England, so I don't really give on the matter.  The gentleman tried to reach his general manager and was not able to.  He went ahead and honored my coupons but he was bracing for the worse once they finally responded.  Overall the pizza was yummy, they made quickly, and they were professional and polite.."}
{"text":"I called the store after the order I placed was 2 hours late. Whoever answered was extremely rude and said the delivery driver didn't get a response at the door so he cancelled the order. I knew no one had been to my door and they didn't even bother to call the number I gave them when I ordered. He resent the order. Later, the delivery driver calls me from the wrong address and argues with me that this is the address I gave them. If I wouldn't have ordered online, I wouldn't have proof I gave the correct address and phone number. Delivery driver finally got here and is talking on his cell phone the entire time, only stopping to hand me the bill and of course the pizza is cold. This place is a joke."}
{"text":"Pizza for breakfast lunch and dinner!?! Ok, no breakfast they open at 11.. but we had lunch and dinner take out...

Not sure one can rate the store poorly for delivery, it's down town Toronto.... it took me an hour to get to the store(4km). Cause of Santa parade.. I knew of delays... and so did the online ordering, I couldn't place an online order, I had to call the store to place the order. Which beats the Swiss chalet ordering system that lets you place an order to a busy location, says ready 10 minutes and you get your food 1 hr late. +1 star for this.

Others complained about it being greasy, that's the point of pizza hut, they used to(not what they use now) lace their pans with Pam... it's supposed to be greasy.... and you'll have hot \"soggy\" pizza when you order oily meats from most pizza joints...

Also I was going to flip out on my double pepperoni, but after 1 bite I realized they did the double layer \"trick.\" They layered some probably less pepperonis under the cheese and more on top.. and my kids even said to many pepperonis so it must have been double. 

Both times it was ready on time and hot... and I got it to my moms home still hot.

Can't fault this store for anything. It was on par with all other hut locations nothing above and beyond and definitely not below expectations.

Would repeat but I gotta declogg those arteries first..."}

Ordered a pizza for delivery and they messed up my order for take out, so I said I will wait for fresh pizza and actually said I would wait however long it took l. for the fresh pizza. they show up a half an hour later with a crusty old pizza charge me full price. Way beyond disappointed with this franchise and their service!!!!!!!"}

When asked for order they said it will be right out.  After 15 minutes our order still was not ready.  A couple who arrived at the same time placed on order and received their order in approximately 30 minutes. After 45 minutes of waiting I finally asked for a refund which took another 10 minutes to get the Manger to get to the front and give me refund.  Needless to say.  Even though I've been a long time Pizza Hut fan, I won't be ordering from this location again.  Might just start ordering from the small local pizza shops."}

Finally they gave us our pizza and wings and we come home only to see that they got the order wrong and out wings were so cold I had to heat them up in the microwave. We've never had a problem till now and I'm kinda skeptical about ordering there again. Which is a shame because I love their stuff crust"}

Pizza arrived after an hour of driving around. The box was so soggy it collapsed when I tried to hole it with one hand. Pizza was barely warm and sooo greasy. Toppings were sparse and chewy. I tried to call the store several time but they won't answer. This is the second time I've ordered from this location. First time was a total disaster as well. It'll never happen again. Save yourself the trouble and order from a different restaurant."}

So I take it back and ask him why he couldn't replace it or even give me a credit. He said because they get so many calls about their bad pizzas. What ?  That's how many bad pizzas you turn out ?  So he made a new one and still messed it up. Won't be back."}

The school calls 15 minutes after the Food was to have arrived and no sign of the pizza! Called the manager and was given a lot of excuses including she's \"new here\". No one ever called back to explain or apologize. I swear this is just the way customer service  in chain food organizations is going.
I can say that all the interactions with the staff was more than friendly. This does not however makeup for poor delivery on what they've promised to provide."}

My son and I get wings and pizza, it's always right and on time or early for delivery. it's only 15 minutes for pick up.  EVERY time I have ordered the pizza is correct and hot and perfect.  Everyone there has ALWAYS  been friendly.

{"text":"0 Stars (unfortunately you must select 1 star at minimum) 

Ordered my pizza at 6:30 PM online and expected delivery in around an hour's time. Noticed 2 hours went by and no delivery. I called the store they told me there was a system issue and they would resend my order, give me 50% off as well as mark my order with top priority for delivery. 

3 hours elapse and still, no delivery. I called the store and the employee (who was annoyed at the fact that I am calling) put me on hold to call the driver. She never came back on the phone. I called back several times and yet no answer. 

Fast forward to 10 PM (3.5 hours later) my doorbell rings and here is my pizza. I am not going to pay for the pizza and I ask the delivery guy to call the store so I can speak to the supervisor. Even the delivery guy can't get through to the store! I refuse to pay due to the extremely late delivery and the pizza delivery guy does not know what to do because he's just the delivery guy so he leaves with my pizza. I will not order from the company again. 

TL:DR - This Pizza Hut store location delivered a pizza almost 4 hours late and provided terrible customer service. Also, I didn't get the pizza."}
{"text":"Pizza Hut food is really hard to mess up but they managed. I figured I'd get wings on wing Wednesday and they could have spared me some sauce. I understand it was kinda late but it was an hour b4 close. I ordered the stuffed crust and the middle of the pizza seemed thinner. Idk not impressed.."}

{"text":"All ways have a good experience there but when I called to place an order today I spoke to a guy named Chris, he was very rude. I asked for the specials and he just gave me an attitude and told me to go online and for that I'm going to be ordering somewhere else now."}
{"text":"The reviews of this place are correct. Ordered pizza for take-out. I arrived 10 minutes before it was scheduled to be finished. Saw my pizza sitting out. No box. Not under heat lamps. Just sitting on the end of the conveyer belt. It was barely warm when I got it. Geez--Get off your cell phone. Put the damn thing in a box. Keep it warm."}
{"text":"My food was fine.  I came here once and felt sketched out by the dark, looming location.  The parking lot is no well lit, and it's just scary.

The staff was ok, didn't seem to care much about anything, oh well...it's Pizza Hut.  

The store is sort of dirty and I just really wanted to get out ASAP. 

Probably will never try this location again."}
{"text":"I have been here for a pick up a time or two.  The food is always decent.  I get the same pepperoni and cheese pizza, breadsticks, or maybe that box thing---haven't eaten Pizza Hut for awhile, so I forget what it's called.  I like the breadsticks best, although they were much better years ago, when I was growing up.

The service here pretty much sucks.  That's right!  Down right crap.  The staff was extremely rude every time I have been in.  Busy with personal conversations or just trying to get \"rid\" of me...is how I felt.  Very unprofessional, even on the phone.  

When I did have Pizza Hut last, I drove out of my way to another location just to avoid the vibe here."}
{"text":"Locations like this are the reason chain restaurants have such a dubious reputation. I've been several times in the last few years and there is always a problem with my order or someone else's. The service is always slow, whether the location is busy or not - how long can it take to make a pizza? Somehow it takes these people half an hour. At least.

The first sign that this place is unreliable is the fact that they quote lengthy delivery times whether it's a busy day or not. 75 minutes? To bake two pizzas and some wings and bring them the mile or so to my home? Forget it. It's easier to place the order and go pick it up. Or it should be. It would be if they didn't lose orders routinely. I'm not the only customer who's had this happen to them, I've seen other people wait an extra 25 minutes when they tried to pick up their missing order.

The pizzas have been lacking in toppings. They sure do know how to skimp on the meats. I hate to say good things about the wings and breadsticks, but I'll let them be the bright spot in my review.

Oh - they will offer you some coupons for your next order if you have issues during your pickup. But why would you want to come back?

If you absolutely must have Pizza Hut, find another location. Best choice is to go someplace else, period."}
{"text":"Ridiculous, ordered a Pizza at 10:00 pm (I received my confirmation email) Pizza never came, no one answered the phones. ..called the next day to figure out what happened, the manager didn't even bother to give me the curtesy of calling me back. Don't bother coming here, usually they serve food cold/burnt or the wrong order,  the one on 35th and Thunderbird is better."}
{"text":"Delivery is a little slow, but I prefer pick up at this location anyway (there's a pick up window) easy for grabbing a pizza after school...pizzas always great."}
{"text":"Great manager and workers and a very clean place looks like it's been remodeled. The people are very nice and friendly. I will be back food was great and hot and just the way I wanted it"}
{"text":"This is a small walk-in/pick up location. 

I work down the road and I always get the individual pizza with a pop for like $5.00.  Their pizza is sooooo good!!

No complaints!!

Just dont order an small pizza from Pizza Hut.  Its like $15.00 and its basically the size of an individual pizza!!"}
{"text":"This Pizza Hut location (3150 Maple Valley Drive, Madison, WI) is very clean and the people are super friendly. I always order the Super Supreme Pan pizza and it is always hot, delicious, and loaded with toppings. Today they gave me a complementary order of Cinnamon Sticks which were great...I love the frosting...Thank You Pizza Hut!  Keep up the great job!"}
{"text":"This is the worst pizza store in Charlotte. I have ordered from this location three times and they have never gotten my order correct. Ever. As the other reviewers noted the management is horrible and rude. Don't waste your money."}
{"text":"I can't even give this place one star. Terrible customer service. The guy hung up on me because he couldn't get my order right and I asked to speak with someone else then the manager when he refused to get someone else. If you get paid to take pizza orders then do your job if you can't then find someone who will. Or find another job!!!!!"}
{"text":"Thought I'd give this location a try. When I got there and the pizza was shown to me it was not what I expected. There was cheese and the ingredients I order. I say this jokingly because sometimes places barely put any toppings on your pizza. The server was friendly and took care of business. I'll be back. Might have to try different sauce with a little more flavor. No left overs-all gone."}
{"text":"Beer was cold, the wings were crispy and the pizza was great. Will defiantly eat here  again."}
{"text":"Wow. Took 20 minutes longer than we were told for carry out when we ordered online.  Cashier was sucking on a sucker.  Very unprofessional especially when dealing with food.  Cashier kept yelling back and forth with the staff in the back.  We were supposed to get breadsticks but they did not have it ready (even though it was in the order).  So they \"gave\" us cheesesticks and said they would not charge us extra.  

Extremely disappointed.  Management should be aware of this."}
{"text":"This Pizza Hut location was recently renovated and looks spacious and attractive. Staff are very attentive and helpful."}
{"text":"You LOSE, hands down, to your competitor, Pizza Pizza, in every way, except you deliver a good pasta, the Chicken Fettucine Alfredo, for $16.99 family size, and you offer Cheese Lover's and Meat Lover's Pizza....but for a price. Always for a price that is NOT the best value.  In every other way but the pasta, Pizza Pizza has Pizza Hut beat.  Their web site works much faster than Pizza Hut's, which makes you wait after every part of your order. Pizza Pizza deliver 15 minutes faster than Pizza Hut (admittedly their location is closer). Pizza Pizza offer you a freebie every time just for ordering by cellphone. Pizza Hut  (PH) offers you NADA, no matter what you do, AND they're more expensive over all than Pizza Pizza (PP).  PP's soft drink deal, 6 cans, any flavour, any combo, $3.99. PH's crummy deal: 4 cans, must be all same flavour, $3.99. PP wings: 20 wings, 2 dipping sauces $15.99. PH wings: 20 wings, 1 sauce, $17.99. Pizza deals:  PP: 2 medium pizzas, 4 toppings + 6 pops= $16.99. PH: 2 medium 3 topping pizzas  AND NO POP = $22.99.  Now I've done the side by side comparison, why would I ever order from Pizza Hut again, unless to get their chicken fettucine alfredo pasta or a meat lover's or cheese lover's pizza?  I tried putting in a complaint on the Comments section of the web site. The web site froze. No dice. So I tried the Customer Service phone number listed on the PH web site and guess what?  Pizza Hut has THE WRONG PHONE NUMBER on their site for Customer Service! And when I got referred to the right one, they cut me off after 5 minutes on hold. I never have those problems with Pizza Pizza. It's 416-967-1111 FOR EVERYTHING. Oh, yeah, one last thing. Pizza Pizza's debit machine lets ME decide the tip. Pizza Hut's debit machine *suggests* I pay 15%, 20% or even 25%! Not bloody likely, you greedy people at Pizza Hut!  You have a lot of  'splaining about your prices and attitude before I deal with you again!"}

{"text":"Walked in to this pizza hut. Was not greeted for 5 mins. Was interupted when ordering twice. Very un friendly crew after this order I will no longer get pizza or wings from pizza hut I will make the extra trip and go to barros, or dominos."}
{"text":"What ever you do, DO NOT go to this Pizza Hut, dirty store, rude, incompetent staff, & they religiously screw up orders! On top of all that they fight you on giving refunds. This place needs to be closed down its seriously disgraceful to the Pizza Hut franchise. If u want pizza in this area just chew on your shoe because it'll do more for you than this place ever can."}
{"text":"Don't pay before you get your food. Showed up and was told my pizza was made wrong and they had to redo it. Paid and then was told to have a seat and it would only be 5 minutes. Well 25 minutes later and after watching the same woman come in, order, leave, and come back to pay and pick it up, I walk up to the counter and the manager had completely forgotten about me waiting for my food. Maybe next time I'll wait to pay when it's ready so I'll get the food when it's done."}
{"text":"Horrible service. This is the last time I order from this location/franchise. The food is usually cold, or I get wet fries. This time my order still isn't here and that was almost an hour and a half ago. Horrible Pizza Hut experience number 4. Get your store together."}
{"text":"My first experience with this location was about 3 weeks ago upon moving into our new home. My family needed something quick so we ordered a 24 piece hot wings and was advised it would be ready in 20 mins. When my husband showed up 18 mins later to pick up our order he was advised they had given our order away. He waited another 20 mins for them to make him another batch while asking to be compensated for their error for which they tried to give him a free soda after they JUST rang him up for 2 when he paid for the wings. After his wait they handed him his wings and we went home only to find out we were shorted HALF our wings. I called back up to Pizza Hut to speak with the manager. She explained my original order was never given away yet it was never made in the first place, she apologized for my short order, and offered to make me a whole new batch on the house. At that point I felt this location gained their stars back until today... 

Today we ordered yet another 24 piece wings and was given a 20 min wait. My husband goes to pick up order and was advised wings were never even made yet again for some odd reason. So the wait begins. He's given a $5 off next visit like others have mentioned. He's given his wings and this time hubby checks his wing count BEFORE he leaves and yet again he's short. The guy in the back laughs, says, \"oh really?\" and then picks up another container listed \"naked,\" adds sauce to them and hands them to my husband all while the guy next to him is paying for his \"naked\" requested wings. It makes me wonder how many people they short change on the wings that don't really complain. Let's be honest, if you short 8-12 wings off a 24 piece order, that's bold! I can only imagine what ordering a pizza would be like. And if people hate the service just that much, who cares how many $5 off your next order coupons you dish you because they won't be returning anyway!!! I know my family won't be!"}
{"text":"Ordered 3 personal pan pizzas via phone. The food was great. Hot and ready before my estimated 15 mins. Only issue I had was HOW the staff took and/or repeated my order. It was confusing. I asked for 2 pepperoni and 1 cheese pan pizza. He could have easily restated the same thing when reviewing my order yet stated: 3 cheese pizza hut personal pan pizzas. 2 with pepperoni. He could never finish his 2nd sentence because I assumed he was ringing it up incorrectly."}
{"text":"Buffet is completely empty and the manager is serving the buffett pizzas directly to a group of women. so the rest of us get a salad bar and I guess whatever cast offs these women don't eat and fling back to the buffet bar. avoid this crappy place. NO PIZZA, NO BREAD STIX, NO PASTA, NOTHING TO EAT BUT SALAD UNLESS THE MANAGER IS KISSING YOUR ASS."}
{"text":"I like to think of myself as an intelligent person, who can express his thoughts well with words.  

But all that comes to mind about this joint is \"comically bad.\"  

I went with people from my office to this location for lunch.  It took a while for a server to come to our table (the place empty- only one other table of patrons) and it took a while for our drinks to arrive.  

What truly made this experience was how long it took for us to get the check.  Our server just walked out.  Like, just walked out.  

Our drinks never got refilled, we never got a \"Hey folks, I'm heading out for a while,\" nothing.  

So, we try to pay.  We go up to the counter, and say we want to pay.  The girl there just shrugs, yells back, \"COUNTER!\" and walks off.  No one comes from the back.  Someone from our group flags down someone who had on a PH shirt to try to get her to ring us up.

This girl manages to get our ticket up, and asks for my ID to pay for a $5 pizza with my card.  If I stole a credit card, I would find better things to do with it than buy a small pepperoni from Pizza Hut.  

The girl tries to ring up the order with my card.  She has to swipe it a number of times.  Then, turns around and walks off.  No explanation.  A woman returns with her, who is giving me seriously dirty looks, and asks to run my card again, that it didn't take before.  

I hand over my card, and think, I can't wait to get to Yelp."}
{"text":"Cheap and effective for the need to feed, just wish I didn't always get the blood farts from their pizza. Would be a different experience if I could enjoy with out fucking up my toilet."}
{"text":"Order ahead of time! We placed our order at 1:45 pm for pick up at 2:45, got there at 2:40, paid my order and the guy said \"your pizza will come out soon\"... Waited and waited, pizza came out at 3:03!!! And it doesn't feel very hot! Don't know what's up with that... But so hungry did not mind anymore!"}
{"text":"This is the first time my pizza was cold and did not have everything I ordered on it. Im a longtime customer and the pizza looked so bad when I finally got it almost 2 hr late, that I gave a  piece to my dog before I would eat it.  Im very disappointed. I will give them 1 more chance and that's it.  Everyone has a bad day once in a while."}
{"text":"I always order online. The delivery is 40 minutes late than estimated, on average. I even received my order almost cold twice even though I live 15 minutes walk from this location.

Somehow they manage to make half the slices crust or put the toppings to a side. The last time one pizza was thinner and the other was thicker than the usual."}
{"text":"You think i would learn my lesson. I officially hate this pizza hut. NEVER again... smh i placed my order at 11:02 was supposed to be here at 11:33 (thats what my email said) i called and spoke to a guy on the phone at 11:45 very rude. I told him when I ordered and how much longer he said he didn't know it depends on where I live I'll let him know I live 5 minutes away literally 5 minutes away very annoyed he said well I don't know he should be on his way. 10 minutes later still no food I called back to speak to a manager of course he says he is the manager I asked for the corporate office number he acts as if he doesn't know it and places me on hold. Than he gives me the number. Than at 12:05 a hour after i order my pizza the door bell rings. No thank you. Smh. I have lived in this area for years. Whoever the new management is suck"}
{"text":"I want to throw up when I think about what happened to me from this Pizza Hut. I ordered 2 med pizzas a cookie and hot wings. The pizzas were very mediocre lacking toppings and cheese mainly dough. Pizza Hut has always been amazing! But this location is absolutely disgusting and the pizzas don't even taste like Pizza Hut  pizzas. But the worst thing was the CHICKEN WINGS! Pizza Hut chicken wings have always been the best chicken wings ever. but again not at this horrible location. I looked at the wings (thankfully) before I ate them and they were full of FEATHERS! never in my life! Have I seen chicken wings that still had many many! Feathers on them. It was definitely the most disgusting experience I have ever had with Pizza Hut and it also ruined my desire to eat chicken wings. I'm starting to really give up on fast food. Cant go wrong with a good home cooked meal. At least you don't have to worry about eating Buffalo feathers"}
{"text":"This place is absolutely bull s**t how can it possibly take 2 hours to make a pizza and chicken wings and deliver it when i live at most 10 minutes away. On top of taking that long the pizza was cold chicken was cold no sauce for breadsticks whoever's in charge needs to be replaced. If i could give 0 stars i would."}
{"text":"If you have fond childhood memories of Pizza Hut, this is the spot to relive the glory days. I can't say that I was a Pizza Hut kid. We didn't really do pizza, and if we did we were ordering in Hungry Howie's. So, I admit some of the nostalgia is lost on me. 

Alas, this PH seemed to be getting a little buzz, and it's in our hood. We decided to give it a shot for a quick lunch. For $5.99, it satiated our hunger quite nicely. The salad bar was fresh, and I love the carrot sticks. When we arrived, the buffet appeared to be mostly meat pizzas. They did not appear to be fresh out of the oven. However, by the time we finished up our salads, they brought out a new veggie lovers. I hadn't experienced black olives on a pizza in quite some time, and those guys were potent! The Pizza Hut crust seems a little box-like to me, and call me crazy, but their cheese seems to pack a bigger than average sodium punch. I didn't feel great about myself afterwards, but I was no longer hungry. 

The pizza wasn't spectacular, but for the price, it works when you need to eat a lot and eat it quickly! Value earns them that third star!"}
{"text":"Horrible service AND slow delivery. Unless you want to wait around 45 minutes for pizza I highly suggest you choose a different location. I ordered a medium cheese and sausage pizza yesterday and didn't even receive any of the sauces I requested. 

This was very disappointing because I live around 6 minutes and this location is the closest Pizza Hut nearby. I would rather drive miles the go back to this Pizza Hut. Never again."}
{"text":"Zero stars isn't an option for some reason. Do yourself and your appetite a favor and go anywhere but here. Pizza wasn't even cut into pieces. The driver apparently dropped it it upside down. The cheese was everywhere but on the pizza. The breadsticks were cold and not fully cooked. Almost tasted microwaved, very gummy like a reheated bagel. No seasoning on the bread. How do you mess something up that you've done 1000s of times? Lots of little mom and pop places would've appreciated my business more. Don't make the same mistake I made"}
{"text":"Worst pizza service I have ever had. I waited 2 hours for my one large pizza. I drove all the way down there to pick it up myself so it would be faster and they said come in 20 min. I went in and they hadnt even put it in yet. So they said wait 8 more minutes. I went in 10 minutes later... And they still hadnt put it in! Again worst service and when they say 2 hours be prepared for 4."}
{"text":"Absolutely worst Pizza Hut I've ever bought pizza from. Toppings overcooked, cheese missing on whole slices of pizza, chicken with no sauce....just horrible. Never ordering from them again."}
{"text":"This is my first visit to Pizza Hut and trust me enjoyed every bite of pizza. We ordered garlic bread sticks which was served with Marinara sauce. Bread stick is loaded with cheese and goes perfect with dip. We next ordered Pesto Pizza with mushroom topping and Did not expect it to be so good in taste!! We even tried veggie lover and this is the first pizza place I have come across in a long time who is generous with topping portions on pizza. Our total bill was $18 something (plus tax and top) and in that price they charge, visit was worth.."}
{"text":"This is the worst pizza hut I have ever ordered delivery from. A simple order of a large pizza, wings, and a two liter. Ordered at just after 10:30 and at 12:30 when the pizza guy showed up I was irate when I said the online page said 21-31 minutes and his response was that page lied to you, we are at a 65 min wait time. It was almost 120 minutes, guy obviously couldn't do math much less a simple task like drive food from point A to point B."}
{"text":"Says they deliver.  But dont.  Will never eat here again.  Food is not up to pizza standards"}
{"text":"Thursday night I ordered a pizza for delivery. It was wrong. I have them another try today. Ordered breadsticks with extra seasoning- they barely had any on them and were well done. Ordered a pizza with pepperoni, sausage, extra bacon, ham, beef. It came with pepperoni only. These people are as incompetent as they come. Took 20 minutes on the phone for them to figure out how to get my order correct and tell me they'd remake it. This Pizza Hut is a joke!"}
{"text":"TL:DR - crappy service and lies, don't waste your time when other pizza places are so close.

I live a 5 minute walk from this pizza hut. 5 minutes. I ordered pizza for delivery because I had guests over. The online system said 30 minutes ballpark for delivery.  That's okay by me. However, by 45 minutes I decided to call and check in. The online people transferred me to the store, and the store hung up on me.

This began a saga of me trying to figure out where my pizza was. I'm not unreasonable. I reached out three times - No answers from the store. Just put on hold until disconnected.

Finally, at about an hour and 45 minutes, I got pizza delivered from a place 5 minutes away.

The worst part is that when I call customer service, I get blown off. They promise I'll be contacted by a district manager, and I never am. Absolutely horrible customer service all around."}
{"text":"I'm almost ashamed to say that I order pizza here, but I do. It's either this, Domino's (hate) or Papa John's (almost too good if you're hammered drunk.) The pizza always takes forever, and sometimes arrives cold. Last night I ordered wings from their Wing Street and they were actually edible, but the little dumbass delivery guy named Pedro didn't say a word the entire time he was standing at my door. I have to assume you know how to speak, as I'm sure even Pizza Hut has that requirement. Maybe he got lost in the bird poo forest on the way to my house and was scared off by the hazardous waste sign at my front door, or the fact that I answered the door with a gun on my hip. Either way dude, speak damnit!!!!

But Pizza Hut, you'll be hearing from me next time I overdo the vodka and Grape Powerade drinks, and I'll still complain the next day."}
{"text":"Ordered pizza online.  Estimated delivery was 6:17p.  It arrived late,  at 6:42p and was room temp.  It had cooled down so much that the cheese had hardened.  Here's an idea - don't send your delivery drivers out with so many order that the last 1 or 2 to be delivered are cold. We're 2.2 miles from the store,  there's no excuse."}
{"text":"$10 for any pizza. You cannot beat it. We've always enjoyed our experience here.  The staff are accommodating and friendly."}
{"text":"This is a pretty standard Pizza Hut located in Las Vegas off of windmill Parkway and Bermuda. I decided to get a to go Pizza and did their 6.99 two mediums special and even got one with Pete with pepperoni and the other with sausage pepperoni green pepper and olives. The pepperoni deep dish and it was good and I would order it again. The other one with green peppers and sausage was regular crust and I didn't like it as much they said that they were out of thin-crust tonight and regular was all they had. I personally think that regular crust at Pizza Hut sucks but getting crispy and deep dish or both excellent and two of my favorite pizzas."}
{"text":"Never disappoints. Every time I order for delivery. My food always arrives sooner than what the set expected time frame is."}
{"text":"I would stay away from this location. I went here ordered dine in the food was typical for what you would expect. My issue came when I attempted to submit payment using a Pizza Hut e gift card. I was told by the Manager Maurice that I couldn't use it there because this location was a corporate location ( keep in mind that I have used e gift cards with Maurice at this location before) I can tell by the suspicious look he gave the card when I submitted it to him something was up. Maurice even claimed to have attempted to use card and it was rejected...I watched him he made no attempt. So I called corporate and was told that the e gift cards were usable at all Pizza Huts. I then asked Maurice for his bosses name and number to which he replied that he couldn't give out her number. So I left all of my contact info for her to call me. I finally receive a follow up call (was told she called me back because I called corp not because Maurice told her to call me like I requested) to which I was told that only franchise locations accept e gift cards. To which I replied how are customers supposed to discern between corp and franchise locations and why would you put that determination on customers? I didn't get as much as an apology for the embarrassment this situation caused me from Maurice the manager or Kate the District Manager. Kate also thought I was some other customer that tried to use a e gift card and they accepted theirs as a courtesy but I wasn't afforded the same. Kate also stated that they don't accept e cards yet Maurice claimed to have tried to enter it but couldn't (this card is a Pizza Hut product) Funny thing I gave the e card to a friend and he used it via the net for delivery with no problem. I even called corp back once more and requested for someone else to call me....no one bothered..."}
{"text":"ZERO STARS: manager LOGAN could have made this review not even exist.

It almost pains me to write this due the fact that the issue was solved in the end and I know the pizza business and dealing with hungry, rude people can be awful. Sometimes people just need to be patient and deal. I did deal and was patient....50 minutes so for a pizza and cheese stick delivery mid day. I received the order in which I asked for the pizza to be \"extra well done\" and only the pizza (it's not my first time ordering pizza the way I want it) BOTH my items were charred so dark another moment in that oven and they would have been black! The cheese was separating itself and you could see the burnt sauce underneath...my stuffed crust large pizza looked like a thin crust mess.

I immediately called the store and spoke to Logan. The warm friendly greeting turned icy as soon as I explained my issue and instead of just offering a replacement she tried to explain why I was wrong and then tried to offer store credit....after trying to contain my frustration I made it clear I didn't wait 50 + minutes for store credit. The whole conversation made me feel belittled and disgusted. Logan was asked the telephone number of the General Manager of the store in which she stated was herself, she was then asked for the district managers phone number in which she did not provide. PLEASE TELL ME HOW YOU FEEL ITS OKAY TO DENY THAT INFORMATION. Literally had to call another location to get that information and thankfully that manager was as sweet and helpful as could be, really what made the situation feel resolved.


***second pizza got here and it was not burnt at all but still was so, so awful looking....I couldn't be more upset to have wasted $20+ over and hour and still all hungry bellies in this home.....would call back again but can't handle dealing with that manager. How sad."}

Driver came ...pizza was cold..said we wanted peppers for the pizza he said they were in his car...we paid him for the food and gave him a tip....He never came back with the peppers ..he just left!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

same driver came back and was very rude...we asked him to leave and he left with our pizza

{"text":"Can anyone tell me why suddenly I keep getting Rene's Caesar dressing and Heinz marinara instead of the Pizza Hut Caesar and their tomato sauce. Gone way way way down hill since what seems like a franchise ownership change. Been a costumer here for 20 years and now I'd never eat here, shame."}
{"text":"pizza at pizza hut is always what you need when you need a fix of pizza and you just do not feel like cooking. The delivery wait time was not long at all under 40 minutes."}
{"text":"The good news - it's Pizza Hut.  Pretty reliable and decent.
The bad news - it's Pizza Hut.  There's better to be had.

We stopped by for a family dinner and ate in.  We got a couple pizzas and some breadsticks.  The waitress asked if we wanted garlic butter for dipping our stix -sounded good, so I ordered that too.  Well, we didn't get that right away.  And the waitress just vanished at one point.  We stopped getting refills and other services.  One other waitress started covering, but overall, we were underserved.  The garlic butter was more like alfredo (NOT complaining!) - I would have enjoyed that with the sticks back when we ate them.

The place is big and usually clean.  Other times, I've had the salad bar and AYCE dinner buffet and it's good.  My kids love the pizza, and we can rely on it.  But, it's pretty standard and nothing to get excited about.  If you're looking for a safe play, this is it."}
{"text":"I get to the store to pick up my online order and walk into 6 staff members messing around upfront. 2 of them were sitting on the counter and shockingly my pizza wasn't even in the oven yet. I walk in and everyone scatters. While i pay for my order that isn't even ready I can barely hear the cashier of the employees now messing around in the back. Should probably find a manager that can keep the employees in line. Worst service ever experienced with Pizza Hut!"}
{"text":"I've never had a bad experience here.

delivery, pickup, whatever, the food always turns out good, for me.

Yesterday they were my saving grace, when Papa John's let me down SEVERELY.

Pizza Hut quoted me an hour-ish wait time (which is fine when I know about it, not when i'm promised 30-40 minutes and it ends up being over an hour like PJ's was)...and they were there at my house with my piping hot, delicous pizza in about 25 minutes.

LOVE."}
{"text":"Pretty good place, their clean, their friendly. The food always looks amazing. The only problem I have about this place, is that their delivery people ALWAYS speeding away in the parking lot. One of their delivery guy almost hit a guy for just speeding off. Other than that I would have gave this place five stars but the drivers to ruined it."}
{"text":"Well over 25mins late... the store refused to answer the phone. I tried waaaay more than anyone should. They hung up on my call every single time. This location is quick to take your money, but not to deliver the product. I'm cancelling my payment to them. I will not order from here again."}
{"text":"So I will say they like always mess up my order haha. Be oddly, I an not bothered by it because they actually make a killer pizza, especially to being a big chain pizza place. This location , in particular, has been so good as I've had other hut pizza and it is never this good. Service is fast and always hot when it gets to me. Yea they're not perfect but they're pretty good for a takeout pizza folks!"}
{"text":"I've never been a huge Pizza Hut fan but every now then I will give it a try. The few times I have visited this location the number one issue is consistency and service. Sometimes my order is perfect and correct...other times it's completely wrong. Their delivery service is much better than their walk-in service. I'm not sure why I did but I waited 10 mins once before anyone came to the front and realized I was their. Even with that I have had some really good pizza from this location."}

I actually don't mind the pizza but never again will I buy pizza from Pizza Hut"}
{"text":"OK, so I know this is a chain. This review isn't really for the food. Honestly you either love or hate pizza hut. It's generic prefab pizza... it's the McDonalds of the pizza world.

This review is purely for the service. While Papa Johns here in Vegas has proven crapy and unreliable.. these guys have been stand outs as far as junky pizza goes. They are always fast to deliver, easy to talk to on the phone, and the \"qualitY\" if you will has been 100% consistent. Also on the night we got 4-8 inches of snow in Green Valley these guys were out there delivering pizza.. even the manager got in his car and started doing some deliveries. 

So if you do want to get your junk food pizza on in Green Valley, this place is quite reliable. I prefer Settebello, or Metro.. or Rosati's.. but sometimes this pizza fiend needs a little PH too."}
{"text":"I placed a pizza order at 10:30pm and estimated delivery was 12:30am which was okay, and expected it is now 1am haven't received my pizza have been waiting 2 hours for food that isn't going to show up... If they were not up for delivering that late, a curiosity call would be great so I don't sit at home hungry.. I'm currently on hold, they picked up the phone at 1am clicked it around and hung up.. Terrible customer service.. Why stay open that late if you cant fulfill deliveries at that time..."}
{"text":"I ordered a quick pizza for dinner and this is what I received...pretty sad excuse for making sure that the half and half I ordered to make sure mushrooms weren't on the other half. Take some care to make sure it's right"}
{"text":"I ordered Pizza Hut last night for my daughter's Birthday.  Pizza was excellent.   The kids loved it.  Delivery driver very polite.  LOVED IT.  Order the stuffed crust."}
{"text":"One time got a pizza with no sauce or a microscopic amount.  Since that time have always had consistent pizza hut quality. Glad I didn't let that one error lead to a lifetime ban."}
{"text":"Not really a first choice for pizza in Surprise.  Went with my gym partner and we waited 5 minutes just to get his order in??  Decided to hang out, they messed up his order and not a fan of all the beetles crawling around the wait area.  
If I could pick another pizza place in Surprise I would take any other of the millions in Surprise.  Sorry, but with so much competition pizza is overdone here. Top notch service and cleanliness is a must in my book."}
{"text":"Really loved their pizza. After ready reviews, we were doubtful regarding it, but it was super delicious. Perfectly thin, crispy and lot of veggies. The guy put lot of spinach over it, which i never had earlier. Feeling happy after having super tasty pizza."}
{"text":"Under cooked dough pizza with raw spinach on top. Gross. Next time Papa Johns. The only good part was the crust."}
{"text":"Let's be honest: most takeout pizza like Domino's, Pizza Pizza, Gino's, etc. is rubbish. There's a reason they all have a 2-star rating on Yelp. Their dough tastes like cardboard. Their cheese sucks. They use subpar ingredients just to milk as much profit out of you as possible.

Tonight, I had Pizza Hut pizza delivery and I was amazed. I have not ordered from Pizza Hut in a very long time. Probably several years. Yes, I could have gone to Pizza Pizza down the street and ordered a $7 medium pizza, instead of paying $24-$25 for pizza of the day after taxes, delivery fee and tips, in which case I would have settled for a really crappy experience. Pizza Hut delighted and surprised me tonight. The dough was actually fluffy and tasty. The cheese was really good for takeout pizza. The toppings gave the pizza that moist texture, cause let's be honest, who likes dry pizza?

Pizza Hut, you surprised me in a good way. I did not expect this level of quality from you. I honestly, don't mind paying ~$25 for a large pizza of the day with delivery as long as I get quality pizza in return.

Now, I do NOT encourage you to eat pizza to begin with, because it is unhealthy. You'd be better off ordering something from Fresh on Eglington or making something healthy at home. However, if you are craving pizza, I don't see how you can go wrong with Pizza Hut on Bayview."}
{"text":"Wow - An old-school Pizza Hut - just like where Mom used to take us in 82'.

Not one of these new high-tech / high-style Pizza Huts - or God forbid a freaking Taco Bell/ Pizza hut combo! This is an authentic old-school classic Pizza Hut Restaurant with the same red roof, a salad bar, waitress service, video games, and old red booths. 

Well worth the drive to bum fuck egypt once in awhile."}
{"text":"Ridiculous,  should be no stars as no food was prepared when I ordered for pick up. Placed order online for 4 pizzas and several orders of wings. Received confirmation email and pick up time and NO notification that that we were \"supposed\"to call and confirm... 

Showed up at our designated time to pick up the order for our staff with of course nothing even started and was informed we were supposed to call and confirm by the older gentleman working there. 

Horrible customer service and respect for time.  Would hate to see you call to make an appointment at ouroffice and then we cancel it because you didn't call us again to confirm that you really did want your appointment you already scheduled. 

Little Caesars here we come.

{"text":"I'm reviewing strictly the lunch buffet that is served Monday to Friday from 11:30 to 1:30 pm. I keep getting flyers in the mail advertising this special and for 8.99$ it seems like a great deal. If you get the flyers, there is a coupon for 2 $ off.  If you want a soda or drink, it's 2.89$ extra, free refills.
Pizza Hut really seems to be going out of business in the Montreal area, whenever I drive by one, the restaurant is empty. This lunch promo is a last ditch effort but not good enough to make me come back for supper.

There's a basic salad bar with two types of dressing, bread sticks with marinara sauce, some small size pizzas: selection of vegetarian, pepperoni, all-dressed and cheese. However the pizzas are lackluster, I don't know why but they're just tasteless which makes me wonder how much different their regular pizzas are. There was one choice of pasta, very dry, almost no tomato sauce, even the melted cheese couldn't salvage it. The restaurant wasn't very full and they weren't refilling the food in time. Perhaps you need to ask if you want more.. 

The best past is their hot cinnamon buns, drizzled with frosting and accompanied with their self-serve frozen yogourt, makes for a great treat.  I wasn't impressed by the whole experience but at least I ended my meal on a sweet note."}
{"text":"The worst slowest Pizza hut in Charlotte...Their delivery is a joke. I absolutely hate that this is the closest delivery location to my house, the 2 times I've ordered delivery from here it has taken longer than an hour and a half..Just end your pizza existence already. Would get negative 19 stars if that was a rating option."}
{"text":"Worst service. Every time we have come here they have messed up our order!!!! Horrible service and delivery times are out of control!!"}
{"text":"I called in for delivery. We ordered 14 inch Hawaiian - stuffed crust and Regular Chicken Alfredo Pasta with Cheese Breadsticks.  The bill came to just a little over $42. This was about 12:10 pm. They said it will arrive 10 minutes to 1 pm. 

At around 12:40 pm we got our order. Talk about super fast!  They got a Speedy Gonzalez of a driver. 

The Hawaiian is the bomb!  When you have ham, pineapple and cheese in your mouth, it tastes sensational!

The Chicken Alfredo pasta was really good!  My wife and I was saying how creamy and cheesy it is.  Delicious!"}
{"text":"This location of Pizza Hut has absolutely the most friendly staff of any Pizza Hut I've ever been to. They're always so nice and welcoming. The food is consistently good also. If you're going to a Pizza Hut in this area, I recommend this one."}
{"text":"Basic Pizza Hut pizza. Not good, not horrible. I ordered three pizzas. They forgot to put the spinach on one pizza and as an afterthought, threw a handful of spinach on top of one of the pizzas. The wrong pizza. Seriously? The pizza should have been remade. That's what I get for trying to save some money I guess, mediocre pizza that was not made correctly. Next time I'll stick to my regular pizza place. Better pizza is worth the price."}
{"text":"I had a bad experience with them 2 weeks ago and I never got my pizzas. I took the time to give their customer service  my feedback and they sent me 2 coupons out of hospitality. We just ordered and used one of them.  The pizza was soooo good. Erik was really nice and the pizza was hot and fresh. The best we have ever had from Pizza Hut! Thank you!"}
{"text":"I had a pickup order today. My pizza was done quickly and was correct. The staff was very friendly and helpful. Maybe I've been lucky for the past few years I've been coming here or because I've always done online ordering. Either way, I like this location and the pizza is excellent."}
{"text":"Avoid this place at all costs. Shabby appearance outside and in and a very unfriendly staff, food is lousy even for a chain restaurant. Too many decent pizza places in Charlotte to settle for this place."}
{"text":"I don't dine in at this place, I either take out or get delivery. The word for this place is SLOW, and the pizzas are usually late and cold. You can usually count on a full hour for delivery. I prefer Pizza Hut's food to Dominos or Papa John's but those other places run circles around this one for service and time. Would love to see these folks kick it into high gear because I'd eat there a lot if they would improve their delivery time."}
{"text":"I did an online order for my coworkers and I at our office around 11:19 AM. The estimated delivery time stated 30-40 minutes, which was totally fine. 45 min later the pizza had not arrived so I decide to call the Pizza Hut location. I woman named Yandy answers the phone tells me my order is not ready and will not be delivered until 12:31 PM, an hour and 11 min after I initially made the order. Yandy wasn't able to explain why their online system claims a certain delivery time when it is clearly a much longer wait. I decided to switch the order for pickup because my coworkers and I had to be back to work soon after. Yandy says she changed it to pick up but not even 5 min later she calls me telling me my order was already sent out for delivery. I ask to speak to a supervisor and apparently I was speaking to a supervisor. It was extremely annoying being told one thing when really the opposite was going on. Pizza arrives and it is less than ideal. 
This is by far the worst pizza delivery service I've ever received, which is very unfortunate because I liked Pizza Hut. Their online system is misleading and their customer service is horrible."}
{"text":"Not pleased at all. I usually order from here and all is good. I placed an order at about 750pm it took over and hour and a half for it to get here and I live literally a 1/4 of a mile away. Ridiculous!! Won't be ordering from here again ... I even called they did give me 20 % off but when it got here it wasn't even hot...."}
{"text":"Convenient location and the staff is friendly. This place never messes up my order and the food is consistent with other Pizza Huts across the country. I also like this location because they have a dining room area for you to eat in house. They deliver, too."}
{"text":"Good experiences here. This is our go to Pizza Hut when we order large orders at work. They get our large orders right and deliver on time. Pizza tastes like Pizza Hut should. Staff is nice, too."}
{"text":"My first experiences here were great. But....I am slowly discovering that this place is so inconsistent with their food quality! Why must I always cross my fingers to get a good order? And they always forget the dipping sauces! Always. So double check your orders. I recently ordered wings and they all looked undercooked. I was too damn scared to finish eating them. I believe they are rushing and undercooking their food. I was actually shocked to see a decent amount of pizza toppings this time."}
{"text":"I'm not really sure what to say in a review for Pizza Hut. But I came in here late night and they were short of staff. But even though the lack of staff, they were very helpful and eager to help. I will return in the future."}
{"text":"Not good quality overall. Bad food and bad customer service. Every time I want to attempt and give them another chance they always manage to top the last worst pizza."}
{"text":"No stars! Girl who answered the phone let me know that I interrupted her day with a loud sigh. They have \"pay one line\". I only asked if credit card used to pay online still had to be verified at delivery location. I only asked a question. No customer service skill."}
{"text":"Worst place ever, ordered two pizzas via the app it said it would be delivered in 30mins cause I'm down the street. It never showed waited a hour and a half no phone call nothing. Tried calling store multiple times waited on hold, just kept saying staff was busy come to find out they closed 30mins AFTER I ordered. So instead of calling me up saying they were closing and can't make my order which would have been fine with me, or even sending an email they could have ordered something else but no they rather steal my money and leave me hanging."}
{"text":"Had a hankering for stuffed crust pizza so my friend ordered a cheese pizza for delivery. It arrived quick! Might be a new record. The pizza was VERY cheesy but I enjoyed my dinner and leftovers."}
{"text":"In the past I've enjoyed Pizza Hut pizza for what it is... cheap, fast, and easy online ordering... but not as crappy as Little Ceasars. I've just eaten my last pizza from PH. I ordered one of their \"new\" hand tossed pizza with mushrooms and pepperoni. Let's just say I immediately felt sick after eating two slices. The cheese tastes completely fake and the dough was undercooked. I should've just paid the extra $4 and ordered from Streets of New York."}
{"text":"The worst! I'm writing as I still waiting for my pizza to show up. It's an hour late and nobody answers the phone when I call to figure out what's going on. I've called 20 times this far. This place always has a problem....unfortunately it's the only one in my area that will deliver. I will NEVER order here again! One star is too generous for this Pizza Hut!!!"}

{"text":"Jamie the manager at night is horrible!! We ordered a pizza and waited over 30 min past the time they said it would be delivered and we still did not have pizza. She claimed that the delivery guy rang the door bell three times, which he didn't. When I asked for the corporate email to file a complaint she said that there wasn't one. When I said their customer service was horrible she asked how and said I could have the pizza in 45 min, 2 hours and a half after we ordered it! If I could do 0 stars I would have"}
{"text":"The price of the combo deal is consider very cheap.   And fast deilevery.  The pizza is not as good as you seat in to a pizza hut resturant.   But i will try one more time from time"}
{"text":"I don't really enjoy writing bad reviews but certain occasions prompt such a review. 
Let me preface by stating my roommate has ordered from this location maybe 3 times a month for the past 5 years, and typically has a good experience. I have been ordering from this location for maybe a year or so and always get the gluten free pizza. Well I guess we've never ordered on a rainy-ish Friday night because our pizzas took well over an hour to arrive, which was stated when we ordered on our iPhone app. When they arrived, the driver neglected to bring us our Pepsi. Wish I would have realized it before I left him a very generous tip. But as soon as I did, I ran down the driveway after him (in my jammies no less) and he said he'd bring it right back. We live about 1 mile from the store. We were starving so dug right in but were very disappointed because the pizzas were cold. I mean not even warm, at all, simply downright cold. We only had a couple pieces and decided we were over it when the Pepsi arrived. I briefly talked to the driver about our displeasure and he said to call the manager. I did. I talked to Alexander who, when I asked to speak to a manager, asked why. I gave him the sitch. I was on a brief hold when Alexander came back and said all the managers were too busy to talk to me. Okay I get it, it's a busy Friday night and maybe they're short staffed or whatever, but you should never be too busy to talk to a customer who is unhappy. And who orders frequently. I mean, I just spent $30 on 2 cold and, quite frankly, not very delicious pizzas, and you can't come to the phone and offer to make things right? Really. I told Alexander exactly how I felt about this, stated that I would be Yelping and ended the call. 
I have ordered from other locations in the past and managers usually acknowledge when they've made mistakes and customers are unhappy. It's rare that I've been unhappy with this chain in the past, but when I have been, they've always been willing to make it up to me. This location was clearly not interested in making things right and is hugely disappointing. And because of that mistake I will no longer order from this location. I am happy to go to another pizza establishment that caters to customers and quite frankly has better pizza. Pizza Hut, if you're reading this you really should be make sure your managers know how important customer retention is."}
{"text":"This pizza hut is the worst I decided to give this location a try since the other pizza hut down the street always has issues. I picked up my pizza checked them it had so many toppings on there it was a mess. All I ordered was a pepperoni pizza. The cashier told me the website messed up my order. Smh. Then I guess what appeared to be a manager came over and said that I would have to wait on some more pizza. no type of apology or anything I just waited. Finally got my pizza the toppings were so skimpy I only had about 10 pepperonis on the whole pizza. Never again."}
{"text":"I'm a fan of pizza but this place has some serious quality control issues. Last Saturday I ordered a supreme pizza for pick up. I went to the restaurant and stood at the counter for 10 minutes without being helped. Finally I asked the delivery driver on his way out the door if someone could help. He doesn't say anything to me turns around and sends someone out to help me. The cashier doesn't greet me or apologize for the wait just asks for my name. I get my pizza and go home open the box and take a slice out and notice its completely doughy, stretchy and not even close to being cooked. I am so pissed now. I call pizza hut and ask to speak to a manager,  I'm then told to hold then the phone call is disconnected. I call back and get the manager Josh this time and tell him the situation. Josh did apologize, I told him there's no way I'm coming back for another pizza or having one delivered covered in spit, I told him I wanted a refund. The manager did refund my money.  I ended up calling Papa John's to order a pizza, the team member was friendly and polite and my pizza arrived in 30 minutes and fully cooked and fresh. Papa John's delivery driver was also very polite and thanked me for my business. I will not being ordering from the Pizza Hut on Val Vista and Warner. Papa John's now has a new loyal customer!"}
{"text":"They need more delivery drivers. Took 1 hour to deliver our pizza. sheesh."}
{"text":"Placed an order today online at 5:17 confirmation said that we would get our order at 6:58. Waited until 7:30 after not receiving our order to call and check only to find out that the Manager Tina had canceled our order at 5:20 without any reason or letting anyone know. So thanks Tina my kids are starving and won't get there dinner tonight. That is completely unacceptable"}
{"text":"Avoid this location. HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE! Felipe Rodriguez (if that is his real name) needs a few lessons in customer service. This is, well WAS my go to for pizza. I accidentally placed an online order at this location while out of town. Out of courtesy, I called to cancel the order and he was extremely rude and hung up on me. I tried calling again to speak to a supervisor but instantly kept being sent to hold. Needless to say, I will not be getting my pizza here ever again."}
{"text":"ZERO STARS!!!

So upset with my experience on 6/19/16. Ordered a $10 dinner box at 5:27 and expected delivery was 60-1hr 10mins. Would've been fine but we heard the delivery car pull up to our house. Saw the car from our upstairs window and went down to the door to open it. My boyfriend saw the delivery driver NOT even get out of the car, and just pull away from the house. NO EXPLANATION AT ALL. He just left! What the hell!!!! 

We did call the store right away, and was on hold for 10 mins before hanging up. Tried again a couple minutes later and someone had told us that because of the game, it would be ANOTHER 1-2hrs. ARE YOU KIDDING ME?! Your delivery driver was in my drive way. HE DIDNT GET OUT OF THE CAR. I cannot believe the horrible customer service. You think people would be more informative with answers rather than not apologizing and saying our order would take another couple hours when it was literally right out front of the door 10 mins ago."}
{"text":"3/10/18 5-8pm

Phenomenal! Hard thing to say about Pizza Hut but they nailed it! The other locations not only make bad pizza but the customer service is crap. This location didn't have the kindest service but they at least responded when I entered the store. The wings had extra sauce and weren't under/over cooked. Plenty of toppings! Can't say enough good things about the food but maybe I'm just shocked lol"}
{"text":"3/5/18 between 7-9pm

Same problem as others and you'd think they would fix it. Stood at the counter and no one even acknowledged us. 2 people were just counting money like it's not their job while another girl stayed in the back sweeping. She finally became helpful and ended up asking us if we'd been helped then continued to go in the back and prepare EVERYTHING coming out of the oven. Sloppily but at least was doing it. She has pink in her hair and a piercing while the man in a blue polo failed to 'manage' and the woman with glasses ignored us. Can't continue...."}
{"text":"I'm done with this location! Everytime I go there the pizza is late. This time though was the final straw. Not only was it late by 18 minutes. People that walked in after me got their pizzas. And I had ordered mine online. Not only was it late but it was wrong. One was the wrong size wrong crust. The other one that was right looks like they dumped an entire bottle of siracha on the crust. And to top it all off, they were both room temperature. I have never gone on Yelp to review something but this was such a horrible experience that I felt I had to warn everybody else. At all costs avoid this location! If it was possible I would give it negative Stars!"}
{"text":"Ordered online at 1pm and stated we would get our food delivered by 1:45pm.
 I called the store at 2:02pm and the employee asked \"did you need to place a new order\" 
I told him that I already placed an order and I was waiting for it to be delivered. His response? \"oh, we just been busy\" No apologies or anything - it is now 2:10, and haven't gotten any food as of yet."}
{"text":"sometimes you just crave unhealthy, cheesey, greasy, delicious pizza and pizza hut always delivers.
the pasta isn't bad either. Caesar salad is as it should be, simple and not too fancy.
the bread sticks i don't care too much for though nor do i like pizza crust.

but yea, im sure everyone's been to a pizza hut before. and if you're free on a weekdays, go take advantage of the lunch buffet cus it is an awesome bang for the buck."}
{"text":"Would give it zero stars if I could. Seriously. The wait was so long. Phone was ringing and the manager was telling all the employees not to answer it.  Constant ringing for 40 mins. It was  driving us crazy. We received the food after waiting 40 mins. Keep in mind we order online and was told when the food should be ready. After receiving the food and taking it to the resort we found a long black hair in the piece my husband was eating. Yuck."}
{"text":"Koko took our order and greeted us and she has the BEST customer service ever!! We don't come to Pizza Hut often, but we will now to support Koko and her staff. Pizza was delicious, nice and cheesy and we got the crust \"Huts Favorite\" style which made it 10x better. Highly recommend this Pizza Hut location!!"}
{"text":"I contacted the corporate office at Pizza Hut and they said sorry and that they will have a member of the team from that store contact me in 3 days. I was never contacted. I let PH corporate know again and they just said sorry. I asked for a refund multiple times but they never acknowledged that. I doubt I will eat at PH again ever - what terrible customer service on all levels. Plus, there is better pizza out there anyway."}
{"text":"I was extremely impressed with the recent improvements in the quality at this pizza hut, I rarely order pizza from chain restaurants, but I like the wings at pizza hut so I went online to see if they had any pizza deals while I was ordering wings. I found a large 2 topping pizza for 7.99 and took a chance. The pizza was very good and fresh I was impressed enough to write this review.The wings are always good although they did raise the price (I went on wing Wednesday) wings are now about .70cents apiece but the guy behind the counter explained that the wings are now bigger and that was true. I cannot comment on their delivery as I went and picked mine up myself. Very happy! thanks for reading....."}
{"text":"I had a craving for pizza and thought I would order for delivery. This is by far the WORST thing I've ever put in my body. 

The ingredients are so low quality I would rather eat my DOGS FOOD. It was DISGUSTING.

Also, the pizza's were barely warm by the time they arrived and they could have been cooked a little longer.  I asked for extra mushrooms and I think there were a total of 5 on the whole pizza. I spent $40 on 2 pizza's with Pepsi, you could give this pizza away for free next time and there's no way I would eat it. GROSS"}
{"text":"The past few months this place was on its game but after last nights order I see they are back to their bad habits which drove us away.  Example green pepper for the whole pizza and only one, let me repeat that, One green pepper was on the pizza.  Wanted a  pineapple Hawaiian pizza out of pineapple so had to settle for a build your own and they could not do it correctly. Yes I am back to that one and very lonely green peeper but there were other members just as lonely,  take Mr. Ham three slices had a piece of Mr Ham but that was it. Pepperoni did you ask? Why yes he was invited but only made a brief appearance on one and a half slices.  I say one and a half cause they cut him down the middle leaving half with his brother and the other half all by himself.  

Hope they get their act back together cause for a few months they were rocking and a smoking the other pizza guys."}

{"text":"as per the usual bad review i wish there was a no star option however since its not available ill give the one star.... where to start first the delivery driver was very rude on the phone when saying was there THEN i get to the door and guess what the food ( which included wings) was everywhere in the bag!!!! had i not already paid online you bet i would not have paid for this at delivery because that was horrible!!! it was a Hugh mess which then of course meant my work area was going to be a mess and frankly Im sure the wings would have tasted great... had they actually had any sauce left on them rather than all over the bag! They were very dry and frankly i will not be ordering from this location again obviously a Hugh mistake they very much do not care about their service!!"}
{"text":"Have visited here numerous times within my 2 years of living in Stow and have always had friendly, courteous service. We are always seated fast, bathrooms are always clean, service is friendly and always with a smile. The only real complaint I have is that their jojo's are horrible! But it's not because of the staff, you can just taste that they're frozen. Otherwise, weather its pick up or dine in I have always enjoyed this location & its staff."}
{"text":"Extremely late on delivery, pizza was bland and tasted horrible. Surprised this place is still in business."}
{"text":"Pizza night!  Was craving some old school Pizza Hut thin & crispy supreme and talked my buddy into it since this location was right by his place.

I read the reviews on this location prior to going so was mentally prepared for anything, ha!

We ordered garlic breadsticks, a large pepperoni and a medium supreme.  They answered my call quickly at 6pm and took my order clearly and smoothly over the phone and told me it would be ready in 15 minutes.

We showed up 20 minutes later.  The order was perfect, hot and just what I remembered, mission accomplished!  Great cheap take out pizza.

Note:  I would have gladly given 5 stars but did not and here is why.  The gal that rang me out and gave me my order was super nice and fast.  However, there was a female voice somewhere in the back giving someone a serious berating.  The girl up front was clearly a little embarrassed by it.  I just smiled.  Whoever at this location sees fit to yell and scream at their employees or co-workers at ANY time, let alone during open hours needs to seriously take a pause and a few deep breaths.  After-all, I once worked a Pizza Hut Delivery as a driver and know what it's all about and it definitely does not require what I overheard, nobody should have to experience that in their workplace."}
{"text":"So I've used this Pizza Hut for years. It's less than half a mile from my home, so it's always been a go to for us. 
I've always done to blind ordering as well, super convenient and quick. 

Well tonight, I placed an order at 3:30pm to be delivered at 5 pm. I've done this before with this location and have never had issues until tonight. 
First, 5:20 rolled around and my order still hadn't been delivered. No one called to let me know they were running late either. Had they done this, I wouldn't be so irked. So I called in to see what the deal was. The girl I spoke with mumbled her name so I was unable to understand her. She said if the order wasn't to be in 10 more minutes to call back.
Driver showed up in that 10 minute frame and handed me cold pizzas and baked bread sticks. I'm completely irritated at this point because my food was late, my family was hungry, and now we have to wait even longer to reheat food that should have been hot when delivered. But then, I call back in to let them know I did receive my order but was extremely disappointed and the same girl decides to give me attitude for me being upset over getting my order cold. 
Then she said \"well what do you want me to do about it..?\" By this point, I had paid cash, so I was unsure exactly how they could even remedy it. But the attitude from this girl had thrown me so off that I was just ready to end the call. 

Maybe I'll go in to speak with the manager tomorrow. 

Point is, order from somewhere else."}
{"text":"This location definitely deserves a zero!! The past 3 times I've called for delivery I've been told the approximate wait time is 3 hours....really???? If you order from this location do so well in advance and schedule a future delivery or go and pick it up."}
{"text":"Order has been messed up the last 2 times. Tonight though they argued with me.  I could still see my order and knew I wasn't plus I was holding the receipt in my hands.  Manager got on and was clearly annoyed.  Made a point multiple times that  she was doing me a favor and needed to make sure I gave them the other pizza back.  I should have just had them take it all back.   We order pizza almost weekly.   Going elsewhere now."}
{"text":"How's this? So I walk into this location and order 2 supreme personal pan pizzas and a small bottle of Pepsi! As I'm just about ready to pay, I notice a sign that says they cannot accept anything larger than a $20 bill. I say, \" Oh oh, I only have a $50\"; which I got earlier from My Wells Fargo bank. The guy says, \"oh you can pay after\"! I guess I assumed that he didn't have enough change and that when other customers come in to pick up and paid cash then he would have enough change or perhaps one of his delivery guys would be able to change it for me......so I just wait til my order is ready. 

When my order is ready, I walk up to pay and decided to change the Pepsi bottle to a liter size. The guy says, \"I can't take your $50\". I'm shocked and say \"but I know you have change because a customer just came in and paid cash\". He says pointing to the sign, \"No, we cannot accept bills over $50. I thought you would go and get change.\" Well, he didn't say that and assumed I read his mind that this is what I should have done! 

So I say, \"ok, so where can I get change?\" To which he said, \"Well you can go to one of the two banks nearby.\" Exasperated & embarrassed, I walked out thinking what kind of business would not accept any bills over $20? What happens if I ordered a home delivery and only had a $50? Would the driver not accept it? If my order was $60 and I only had a $50 bill & a $20 bill, would they refuse to take my money? If my order was $80 and I only had a $100 bill, would they make me go to one of the banks and change it? If it were a home delivery, would the driver refuse my $50 or $100 bill and take my order back because they could not take bills over $20?

Hello Pizza Hut! I just wanted 2 pan pizza and a drink and had cash! My $50 was not considered cash? If I had my debit card, you would have taken it with no problem but my $50 was not acceptable! I could have given you my finger prints, home address, & cell number with that $50 so you could find me easily if you discovered it was a counterfeit $50 bill! But NO.....you decided to embarrass me because I might have looked like a Latina to you and I could potentially have a counterfeit $50 bill! Well, I'm not! I'm from Maui, Hawaii and I am of Filipino & Japanese ancestry! Thank you for making me feel inferior! 

Why can't you be like all other business that would have checked the $50 bill with a black pen that identifies it as being a legal tender of the United States of America? Thank you for embarrassing me that you would even consider that I would pass illegal money. Thank goodness the only person who was there was a female employee and you sir, I assume, is the manager on duty so my embarrassment was limited to  just the two of you and no other customers! 

I will continue to share this incident over and over again on Yelp, Facebook, Twitter and all social media because of your bad business practice of racial discrimination."}

{"text":"Horrible experience I order from them it literally took 2 hours to get my order they told me it would only take 45 to 55 min when I placed the order to top It off when the pizza got here it was cold and nasty and my wing were bone out I ordered bone in with ranch they didn't even bring the ranch I talked to the manager Raul he said he would have another order of wings sent out I'm still waiting one hour later I'm not even in the mood for wings anymore worst pizza delivery ever I will contact corporate in the morning this Pizza Hut cares more about taking your money rather than making sure they are properly staffed to take all the calls that are coming in at Least be honest and let a customer know there is a 2 hour wait and let them decide if they still want to wait that long"}
{"text":"This place has the laziest workers I've ever known.

If you want a pizza last minute within the hour of it closing, don't bother. They will make dumb excuses up to avoid making food that they don't want to make because they want to go home for the night.
Some excuse would be: We have no drivers, problems with anti-freeze, and fryer maintenance. If you get any of these excuses, make sure to call them out on it and flip on them. And post your experience on here too. 

The worst service ever and they are such a horrible representation of Pizza Hut."}
{"text":"TERRIBLE. Do NOT use them. Ordered food for high school team. Call store and let them know we needed by 5pm. Was informed it would be there by 445pm. After an hour pizzas did not arrive. Then was told pizzas done 30 min ago but no driver. Manager refused to talk with customers.
Another 30 min and store call and says they forgot to make 2 of the pizzas. Had to cancel order because match over. Athletes were disappointed and hungry. Use Papa Johns or Dominos."}
{"text":"After an hour and a half waiting for pizza, I called this Pizza Hut to see what was going on.  Well, after my order had come in at 8:47, they have a policy that all new customers need to have their phones called.  Well, at no point in the hour and a half before I had to call them did my phone go off.  Funny thing is, it dials out to them just fine.

Needless to say, the manager who called someone's phone, also left them a voicemail.  So I hope they're not too upset about that pizza they didn't order.  Once they can't get a hold of someone, they just cancel the order.  Here's the thing though, when a store cancels an order, it doesn't show up in the system, so your mobile has no idea.  So after they canceled it, there's no notification for the customer.  Guess I'll be scanning my bank account to see if they charge me on top of it.

If I'm looking for a positive, at least the girl on the other end of the phone was nice. Still, she didn't offer to do a thing to make it right.  What a shame.

The kicker?  Their form on their website to complain also didn't work.  Must be a criterion for being with the company that you can't process an order.

So... there you have it, save your time, money, and irritation, get pizza from someone else, and let these clowns keep calling people that didn't order pizzas."}
{"text":"This is her husband, but unless they don't actually close at 11 like it says on the door and the website, then the place was closed, doors locked and lights turned out 40 minutes before closing. And a person inside who ignored my presence. Which means I wasted gas and became a very unhappy customer who might not return. Plus that is money that the company won't get."}
{"text":"I ordered hand tossed pizza and it was thin crust pizza I will be sure to never go back to Pizza Hut ever again because your pizza sucks."}
{"text":"Bad experience....even poorer resolution from management. There are great Pizza Hut's and not so great locations. This place gives the crappy ones a bad name.
.....but, they are busy as hell so don't expect service or quality to change any time soon."}
{"text":"I always order delivery form this location. They are usually always on point with the pizza. Tonight was so different. When the pizza came it wasn't hot, barely even warm. The pizza tasted old like it had been sitting out all day. The sauce was super sweet. I'm mad I wasted 18 bucks plus tip on this crappy pizza tonight. Pizza hut you truly disappointed me tonight."}
{"text":"This location does not show up for online ordering.  This may be because they do not carry the full menu."}
{"text":"I live in the area and have been here quite a few times. I have always noticed that service is slow as the other reviewers have mentioned. They have only 1 server and you end up waiting a lot at times. Once I had a pizza served that was slightly burnt."}
{"text":"I ordered my pizza online, only to find out that the pizza was going to take over an hour. After getting a busy signal and having to wait through several rings, they finally picked up and I was able to switch from delivery to pick-up. When I arrived 20 minutes later, it took 5 minutes for anyone to greet me. The food quality is okay. but not at all worth the poor service.

This was my 2nd bad experiance with this location. I had a similar experiance prior to this but though I'd give them a chance. The time before I'd asked if I could add breadsticks to my order when I arrived, they said it would take an additional 30 minutes. Really!?!"}
{"text":"had food here with family, service is extremely slow. servers seem disinterested and messed up the orders. It's happened two times that I have been here but the food tastes good. Just wish servers were more energized and not slow"}
{"text":"I'm a sales manager in a corporation and managers today just don't understand what it takes to make the customer happy, they take it personal as if they own the company or the store and never realize that they don't. Couldnt switch out boneless wings for traditional wings and literally argued with me over something simple he could have just told his staff to do because they got it wrong!!! and it would have made me happy but now you lost a loyal customer and I will never order Pizza Hut at any company events because there is probably more slaps just like you that work there."}
{"text":"One of the worst locations!!! I just called to place a order and was told that they didn't have any beef toppings. Called 2 weeks ago and it wasn't any dough.  WTF!!!"}
{"text":"If I could I would give them \"-star\" if u planning to eat in be ready to stack there for an extra hour. And make sure they got ur order right. They totally not paying attention to eat in customers.. Even though we where the only one table in at the time."}
{"text":"Great phone customer service and quick delivery time pizza looked and tasted great!!!"}
{"text":"Nothing wrong with this hut since the menus were expanded. Love the individual pies that you can build yourself. Staff very nice. Cost inexpensive too."}
{"text":"I ordered my pizza at 7:57pm on Saturday May 12th. I was told it would be there in 35mins. 
It arrived at 8:50, no big deal, delivery guy is cool and everyone is happy that the pizza arrived. 
Once I get the kids settled and feed them their cheese slices, I notice that my pizza order was wrong. It was missing 2 toppings and didn't have extra sauce. - no big deal, I figured I'd call the store and they would make it right. 
The woman who answered didn't seem to be sympathetic to my situation and put me on hold. When she came back on the line her attitude was not friendly and said the best she could do was remake it but I'd have to give the pizza I didn't order back... (as though that was going to be an issue ) I said that's not a problem as I didn't want that pizza, I wanted the one I ordered. (Up to this point I'm friendly and being understanding that mistakes happen, I just want the situation handled and to get what I actually ordered and paid for)
Her attitude was less than pleasant and said the the soonest she could get it to me was an hour.  (2 hours from when I ordered the pizza in the first place)
I began to get frustrated with the complete incompetence and lack of customer service of this sad excuse for an employee and asked if there was anything else that could be done and her attitude became worse... 
So I will never be ordering from this store again. If I was the owner of this place I would either fire her or keep her away from customers..."}
{"text":"I've been here about 4-5 times for the lunch buffet over several years, always hoping for a better experience.  The price is right for the lunch buffet but the quality of the pizza is shabby.  As another reviewer stated well; salty.  If you order a regular pizza it is not nearly as bad tasting as the lunch buffet.   

The restaurant is well worn out, cramped seating, and normally only two staff checking customers out, seating, refilling drinks etc.  Seems very under staffed.

I do not know why I continue to have faith in this place; however it is time for a change of location and never here again!!"}
{"text":"I've had bad experiences at other Pizza Hut shops, but this one always gives me well made pizzas. Pizza is always fresh, never burnt, always done by the time I get there. There's always people in there so I'm assuming they feel the same way. Try the stuffed crust and crust toppers."}
{"text":"Ordered take out as I was walking to my car from the hospital down the street (less than 10 min drive) and it was ready when I got there. Food smelled good and tasted delicious."}
{"text":"Worst pizza ever, it was complete grease. And not even normal pizza grease it seemed like they just pored greased. Not only that I FOUND A HAIR!!!

I didnt even call to conplain because i wouldnt even eat this trash for free. Ive been to pizza hut for awhile but this ine is always disgusting"}
{"text":"Buffalo medium wings? Really? Every time I order from this Pizza Hut I get dry ass wings and pizza dough that isn't even cooked all the way"}
{"text":"ZERO STARS!  Absolutely worst customer service ever!!!  Tried canceling the order because it said was going to take 2 hours to deliver.  Would not pick up the phone and they kept hanging up on me!!!  Thought they were busy, I get there, and no one in the store but employees and a guy and the counter \"taking orders\".  You can take my order but not answer the phone?  WTF!!  This place is completely ridiculous!!!"}
{"text":"2 stars because it came before the 1 hour estimated delivery time.  0 stars for quality and temperature of pizza when it arrived.  Oh wait, minus a star for the delivery drivers restrictions on carrying packs of parm and pepper... And if I could minus one more star for not knowing how to half/half a pizza I would.   I guess you should really know what your getting coming here, but I thought they just might of improved in the past couple years we haven't eaten here.  Wrong, they still suck big time!"}
{"text":"Worse customer service ever. I ordered my pizza online at 5:48 and promise time was 6:03. 
I arrived around 6:15 and after I paid the staff told me to wait 15 minutes. I waited for over 20 minute and saw other customers who came after me get their pizza. 
I went and asked about my pizza and the staff just realised that it was already and was sitting in the oven since I arrived. 
There was no apology or anything. 
I understand that they are busy but the staff needs more training and needs to be more attentive. 
I wish I can give zero stars rather than 1. 
I won't be coming here again"}
{"text":"I gave them a star because the individual who delivered our pizza was nice... and because you have to give a star. 

In regards to the Pizza Hut website: The unnecessarily verbose language of the terms and conditions is inappropriate. Being required to read several pages of text with the intent of ordering a pizza is the equivalent of sitting down in a restaurant, ordering, and then being asked to sign  a multiple paged contract before continuing. It's quite ridiculous. Am I giving you permission to poison me without consequence? Who knows? I won't, because I'm not interested in reading Pizza Hut Ordering: The Book. (This review portion brought to you on behalf of my lawyer father.)

The rest of our experience went as follows:
We called to place our order so that we may bypass the silly contract and had difficulty getting the individual taking our order to comprehend what we wanted. We tried to communicate our two pizza orders as clearly as possible, but it was as though he wasn't familiar with the menu options. We were impressed that they delivered the pizza in 30 minutes, rather than the 60 we were quoted. However, upon indulging in our meal, we discovered that this quick delivery was seemingly the result of prematurely taking the second pizza out of the oven. The dough was undercooked and the pizza was cold. 

We won't be ordering from this location again, and this may even be our last Pizza Hut order."}
{"text":"The stench from the nail salon next door is stinking up the pizza hut, so sad they have poor business neighbors, the property manager should be involved to fix this sad state the customers and staff have to endure"}
{"text":"So sad that I ordered from this particular establishment. We order pizza religiously here via carryout. I ordered 2 large one topping pies and called the phone number 704-529-0701 to inquire how much the pies are. The young lady stated $6.99. I knew this, but the reason for my inquiry was because my son came home with a bill in the amount of $21.65. I told her this and she asked for the ticket number which I gave her. She then blind transferred me to another individual before explaining that I was overcharged. I explained again and she stated that she would grant me a credit of $10.00 since I had overpaid. She placed me on hold and then came back stating that now that they are under new management, you can only obtain this everyday special with a coupon that should be on the box. My son had no coupons on the box. She then transferred me to Dominic, the Assistant Manager who stated that the General Manager, Marcus no longer grants this special unless there is a coupon. Too much to deal with. I will contact the GM tomorrow. I don't want a free pizza. I'm not trying to scam for a credit. I just want them to adjust my bill. I also pick up many pies for United Health Group each month. They just lost a family of 6 and about 50 pie orders per month from my place of business due to their lack of professionalism. Really sad. Never again."}
{"text":"There was an impromptu game of Risk happening at the ol' homestead the other night... I was one of the last people to know about it... lol I hit the phone booth and changed into my alter ego \"SuperHostess\"... I ran to the local grocery for snack staples: chips, dips and drinks...  I would have tossed a lasagna into the oven, but I only had about a half hour... (I believe this is where someone says, \"Ain't noboby got time for dat.\")  I elected to call the local Pizza Hut and get some vittles...

Luckily, there was an awesome special.  A large pizza with two toppings for $7.99 for carryout only... That'll do it!  We ordered two: pepperoni/sausage and pepperoni with extra cheese...  I ordered some breadsticks to go with and was quoted 20 minutes... I got there in about 25 minutes... I like to give a little cushion, just in case... Turns out I didn't need it... The food was sitting right in the warmer when I got there... 

The order was correct; all of the pies and breadsticks were nice and hot... The service was fantastic (Thanks, Em-Laaaay, for the best laugh ever with your awesome nametag)... When I got back to the abode and the folks got their nourishment, everyone was pleased with the quality... 

I'll definitely be ordering from this place again... They saved me in a pinch without a hitch..."}
{"text":"We were heading to UNCC for a graduation and since the husband is not a fan of Hardee's, there really weren't a lot of options around. It was around 11:30 am, so we decided to run into the Pizza Hut across from Target and pick up a personal pan pizza with an order of breadsticks. The pizza was freshly made and it was greasy, but it's pizza. That makes sense. What doesn't make sense? The breadsticks were not even close to warm. That must have been the first thing they made that day and they didn't even bother to stick it under a warmer or anything. The marinara was literally cold. They likely pulled it directly from the fridge and stuck it in the bag. I called back and they offered us a free lunch, but we're never in the area, so I guess we paid over $10 for a personal pan pizza and that's that."}
{"text":"Burnt our pizza. 
Middle of the pizza was unedible, had to cut out the middle and just eat the edges.  Was a disappointing waste of money.  Sure, first world issue and all that, but still annoying that I spent money on this unedible thing."}
{"text":"Before I ordered I ask cashier how long for order for pick up ? and he said about 15 min but I'm waiting for more 30 minutes for pick up my order !!!! never again"}
{"text":"My family and I are here for lunch on 7/17/17 and we're all shocked. There is only ONE person, Kristen, working the entire restaurant. She's cooking, cleaning, waiting tables, answering phones, ringing people out, everything. There's no way in hell that this is safe! If something were to fall off a shelf and knock her unconscious- no one would have a clue! This poor woman is working her ass off in here and trying to maintain a happy attitude and of course there's rude and Obnoxious people in here who don't care at all. As a business owner this is terrible to see, even in the slowest locations of you are going to be open for business, you need to have more than one person working In ANY type of establishment- in case there's any form of emergency. I will be contacting the corporate office. 
As for the restaurant itself- it's clean- other than this one woman having to deal with us, carry out orders and the phone ringing- she has one table she simply hasn't been able to get to. I feel bad for this woman, most people would wear their irritation on their face and in their tone- but she is pushing through. I hope Pizza Hut takes care of this situation.

-UPDATE-
After an hour we never received our food and we left. Called corporate and they filed a claim. Hopefully this will get resolved."}
{"text":"I just tried to order a pizza from this place.  Forty minutes later I had a message on my phone from a number I didn't recognize.  The voicemail said it was the delivery man.  I called the restaurant and they told me that I had to use a credit card to order since we were a new customer.  I had ordered from this place multiple times with no issue, and so me being a new customer was not in any way correct.

We were beyond hungry at this point and the pizza wasn't even out for delivery yet, so I told them just to keep it and we wouldn't be ordering from them again.  I don't expect the greatest meal ever, but this was straight amateur hour and I wouldn't recommend anyone else waste their time."}
{"text":"When a delivery driver lies to you about the total so you give him more money plus a tip on top and it takes a month just for you to get your money back with no type of compensation for having to go through all of the trouble... you're driver cheated me and it takes a month to get money back that was rightfully mine?!?!?!? I HOPE EVERYONE SEES THIS WARNING!!!"}
{"text":"I really wish I had something nice to say about this location and the pizza I just wasted $20.00 on...but I am speechless!

The location is set in the middle of many other small restaurants (hey noodle) etc, making it a busy parking lot filled with dawdling drivers who r too busy talking and unable to concentrate on their parking skills. 

I should start by saying I am not a huge fan of pre-made pizza crust and sub-par pizza sauces...,however I did try a slice of Pizza Hut from a Kipling location last night and it tasted / looked incredible. 

This fiasco of a pizza I just bought was greasy with a soggy cooked on one side crust - and their version of the  the cheesy crust was an oozing mess of cheese-less oily bits of goop where the crust should be. 

I feel sick just recounting the horror of this thing. 
Ignoring the hideousness of this so called pizza - I ventured in to try it ....2 slices and 4 greasy crust-bits later, I have a stomach ache and the thought of ever eating pizza again makes me want to go fHURL!!

Yelp really needs a minus-star rating as well. 
Minus 5 stars for this place!!!

Oh wait - I do have a good thing to say about this location. - the cute little Tamil girl who was singing Twinkle Twinkle Little Star while while waiting for her pizza."}
{"text":"Gross pizza and possibly the worst customer/employee service of any restaurant nationwide. How is it that a local franchise owner could hire the worst possible employees to represent them? We've ordered twice and never will again. Both time were equally awful on both taste and service. And for the drivers, slow down in our small community!!!"}
{"text":"This is Pizza Hut, nice and dirty. Cheesy and greasy. Just how you like it! I order from this location quite a bit. Sometimes I get a great amazing pizza. Other times they skimp on the cheese or it's not hot enough. That's always a bummer.

I've been here at least 20 times though. Overall I think it's a good Pizza Hut. I've never dined in, only taken out. I've had pizza delivered from this location as well. 

When I order to take out the staff is always friendly and helpful. I have never had any major complaints. There is usually enough parking. I see a lot of families that come to eat here. 

I like that they have a pick up special, and other specials because the last thing I want her to 2 L Pepsi's with 2 gigantic pizzas for $30 or $40. I like to keep my dirty Pizza Hut addiction to as minimum as possible."}
{"text":"The deep pan was doughy and seemed in cooked,  we live a block away from the store , it took an hour and our pizza was not hot, just above warm.  The Chicken wings were hot and good that's why I gave them two stars.    We might give them another chance in a month or two.   Pizza lovers give them a try they might get it right.  We went a cross a street to the other pizza a place."}

{"text":"Unbelievable. My boyfriend's mom ordered everyone in the house dinner, totaling out to about $60 dollars (without tip). We received the order in a timely manner but my pizza was made wrong, missing toppings, we called the store back to find out that the girl knew the order went out wrong and DID NOT BOTHER TO CALL AND STOP THE DRIVER. We talked with the girl, she was nice, she said they would send the correct order right away. It had been about 20-25 minutes and my boyfriend's mom called to check on my pizza, because by this time everyone was about done eating besides me, which wasn't a big deal to me, but is was to her. A delivery driver answered the phone when she called and was EXTREMELY rude,  this really upset my boyfriend and really made me upset because how are you going to be that rude? Especially to some ones mother! That delivery driver should not be answering the phone if they don't have an understanding about customer service. We have already contacted corporate about this situation and we hope that this problem is resolved properly. Absolutely unacceptable."}
{"text":"How hard is it to get an order correct???????  Here's my reasoning behind a 1 Star rating- we ordered a supreme pizza with 2 Pepsi, and we placed the order hours ahead of time for our pizza to arrive at 8PM.  They show up at almost 830, and bring DIET Pepsi!  Now really, how hard is it to screw that order up?  Thing about it is we didn't learn our lesson the first time.   Last time we ordered from this Pizza Hut they forgot to bring the side sauces we ordered.  Bottom line - no attention to detail and I have to question their competency.   If you can't get a simple order right then you fail, and if you fail working at Pizza Hut, there's really not much else left for you in this world."}
{"text":"Cheese sticks were under cooked, the pizza was EXTREMELY greasy.  I mean, oil was literally dripping out of the crust. Gross. It also had kind of a funky aftertaste. Wings were okay. 

With so many options for good pizza in town, there is pretty much no reason to eat at pizza hut, even if it does save you a few bucks. Boo-urns."}
{"text":"I'm not sure why we thought it would be a good idea to try this place based on the reviews.   We placed our order online at 9:47 PM with an expected delivery time of 11:17 which probably should have been our first red flag. 

When our pizza had not arrived by 11:40, I tried to call the store but never made it past the automated message only to be disconnected after 7 minutes waiting.  I then received a call at 11:52 stating that they would not be able to deliver our pizza because the drivers car battery died. 

UPDATE:

I was told that our order would be refunded.  As of the following Tuesday it had not.  I called and spoke to someone who said that it was only an \"Authorization\" and would \"fall off\" in a few days.  He took my phone number and was going to call me back once he found the information about the refund.  Three days later I have yet to hear back from anyone and of course, the charge did not \"fall off\", the transaction was completed.

To recap:  2 hour wait, no pizza. no refund."}

Food was semi cooked, Lady wrote some random name on the order so they had a hard time finding my order, to top it off Worst Customer Service goes to them!

Pizza was not cut properly either."}
{"text":"Sometimes has decent food but most of the time things are messed up. Ordered the chicken taco pizza, pepperoni and mushroom stuffed crust, and cheesy bread. Cheesy bread was awesome as usual but they only give u enough sauce for two pieces. But they give you 5 sour creams and 5 salsas for a chicken taco pizza that's gross. Pepperoni mushroom was ok but crust was soggy. Pretty disappointed. If we do order from them again since there is no dominos we will only get the cheesy bread. Oh and not to mention the last time we ordered from them my husband got sick off their pizza. I guess that's our fault for thinking we could give them a second chance though."}

I called HQ and received 2 calls back from the store manager within 24 hours. Not only was he incredibly apologetic but, he made me feel important to PH's success. I received my comp. and proceeded to try ONE LAST TIME! The pizza was not only correct, it was DELICIOUS! My hubby and agree we have not had PH so good since you could eat at the restaurant!  I just hope the rest of the issues remain \"in check\". THANK YOU !!! Keep up the good work and we will continue to use this PH! NOM"}
{"text":"We ordered pizza from this particular Pizza Hut. We ordered a medium pan crust pepperoni and onion pizza and we went to pick it up, when we picked it up and drove it home, we eat the pizza it was quite disappointing! It had almost no sauce in it just dough and cheese. Very disappointing."}
{"text":"I have been ordering from this Pizza Hut for years and the past few orders I have not been very impressed at all.  The pizza had absolutely no mariner sauce on the pizza, I pulled the cheese back and all I see is the bread with very little red here and there. It didn't even cover the whole area. Then the mariner sauce for the cheese was so runny that I have to imagine they mix water with it.  The service has always been good, the delivery people have been good as well."}
{"text":"I've had great Pizza Hut in my time, but the order I was just delivered from this location was nothing short of garbage. They delivered me a pizza which was undercooked. If that's your version of Origin Pan Crust, it blows. I can't believe you deliver a product of this class to people."}
{"text":"If you're the type of person who only reads the first few lines of a paragraph then pay attention to what I'm about to say; DO NOT ORDER FROM THIS STORE. 
   Let me start... we wanted to order delivery but decided to go with carryout after hearing about the atrocious 4 HOUR DELIVERY TIME. We ordered a few pizzas (one hand tossed..remember that!) some sides and a soda. Showed up 10 minutes after projected ready time to give them a little leeway. Was told our order was in the oven and should be ready in less than ten minutes. No problem! I don't mind waiting, stuff happens. 10 minutes later I'm told it's ready... I wait for another 5 minutes while the employee disappeared. I'm assuming he was getting my order together as it clearly wasn't ready. Finally I received my food and was on my happy way home. Keep in mind I live a short 2.5 miles away from this location and drove straight home. Our food was COLD, and both my pizzas were pan style. Now, why was I told my food wasn't ready but yet when I received it, it was cold?  We tried to call and speak with a manager but after 20 minutes of listening to the employees speak amongst each other and take orders (they never even put me on hold, more or less just laid the phone down).  Finally hung up. Not worth it. One of the worst experiences I've ever had. I wouldn't recommend this place to my worst enemy."}
{"text":"TERRIBLE. I Paid $30 for 8 wings, and a pizza no one will eat because apparently they don't use sauce on their pizzas at this location. Couldn't even cut the pizza all the way through to the bottom. I will never spend money at any PH franchise again! Would rate 0 stars if I could."}
{"text":"Went in to pick up my order and on my way out I heard one of the employees make a disparaging (racist?) remark.  I turned around and the two people (one of whom looked like a \"manager\") at the counter were laughing.  I went back in and asked if the comment was directed at me.  Both stopped laughing and said it wasn't, and that it was directed at one of them, which I suppose in their eyes made it okay.  I told them how inappropriate the comment was regardless, and left.  I emailed Pizza Hut with my complaint."}
{"text":"I am not one to normally write reviews but seeing as a lot of people have complained in the past on here I felt I needed too. I moved here just for the month and work a lot so this Pizza Hut has been my go to quick lunch/dinner since the day I moved in (as Pizza Hut in general is my boyfriends favorite \"fast food lol) & they have been amazing. Whether it was a pickup or delivery they have, first and foremost, been so nice &&& have not messed up my order once! Even to the add-on sauces. I don't know if they've had a change of management or staff since the other reviews were posted but I have had nothing but a great experience with this spot. I'm honestly sad to move next week & I hope the next Pizza Hut closest to my new home is just as amazing (let's hope for my boyfriends sake haha) - thank you Pizza Hut! xoxo"}
{"text":"Worst Pizza Hut in the country!

Ordered pizza and after waiting more than 1 1/2 hours I called to ask where the food was. I was told by the person who answered the phone that she just had 2 people quit and that she sent the food and no one answered the door which was a blatantly lie as we were sitting outside the entire time waiting on them. They just don't care and I will never order from this store again."}
{"text":"I ordered pizza for pickup, once I arrived home I realized there was hair in my food. I simply called back to this location and asked for a remake and for them to deliver it to me. I didn't think this was to much to ask considering it wasn't my fault. I was told that's wasn't an option (all while being super rude) and when I asked to speak with the manager was told there wasn't one even tho when I picked up my pizza I clearly saw a man with a solid red polo shirt on which was different from the rest. They need to work on customer service."}
{"text":"Tonight we've received the most outstanding service from Dez. She is awesome and so attentive.  And that's just the icing on the 'pizza,' the pizza was so good and the place was nice and clean!  Way to go Dez! Thanks so much!"}
{"text":"Cheap pizza but the manager is very nice and polite, not his fault its a nation wide chain, good staff"}
{"text":"This is the 3rd pizza they have messed up on a carry out for us. It's so disappointing getting home and getting nothing what you paid for. When I went in on a Sunday night it was nothing but a bunch of kids messing around when I walked in. Nothing was sanitary and they were eating pizza from random boxes laying all over the back room. Read the comments here people this place has a serious problem."}
{"text":"I  ordered a pizza  a week before and  during the Super Bowl.  Pizzahut never even told me about a medium size pizza  for 6.99 - 2 or more. I will confront them everytime about every size pizza hut!!"}
{"text":"WTH PH?!?! Why did my order (on a Thur) take more than an hour???? We called and was placed on hold and you claim \"it's in the way\"....crap! We have a house full of kids complaining because it was taking so long. Not happy! You should comp our meal or offer a free pizza or something! :-/"}
{"text":"I called to order and the kid that answered said \"hello?\" Like hello is this pizza hut? Lol. Couldn't tell me how big a medium pizza was. His answer was \"they don't tell us the sizes\" Ok? Went to pick it up the girl at the front was very rude. I know it's just a pizza hut I wasn't expecting much but jeez"}
{"text":"We placed an online order at 6:14 PM. It is now 9:01 PM and our order still has not arrived. We called to inquire twice. The first time, after waiting 2 hours, we were told that our order would be a further 30 min wait. We waited a further 35 minutes and called again. The phone representative apologized for the extremely long delivery time with our order, said that he did not work at the store that we called directly, and said that no one at the store would answer the phone. This sounds promising! Despite a 3 hour wait, he could not tell us when our order would be delivered, offered us a pathetic $10 credit for our next order (why, for any reason, would we order from Pizza Hut again?), and actually encouraged us to cancel our order. Ridiculous!

Before placing the order, we expected a longer than usual delivery time because of the current weather situation outside. However, having to wait almost 3 hours now with no communication from the store, and no indication of when the order might arrive, is just completely unacceptable. Pizza Hut will not receive my business again."}
{"text":"Pizza was small and overly greasy.  Otherwise it was good.  The atmosphere for dining inside is rather dated and limited."}
{"text":"Horrible. I tried to order online two times since I moved to Champaign and both times I ended up with no pizza. First time I cancelled my order because of the two hour wait time and tonight I was informed their driver couldn't deliver because of a flat tire. I guess he's the only one they cared to hire. I will not be going back to try again."}
{"text":"Not the cleanest pizza hut but my food was hot and on time."}
{"text":"I would avoid the pizza hut on decatur...I ordered there the other night and got delivery ..They sent me a totally different disgusting order of cardboard pizza with wings and a drizzle of sauce .Then my husband had to call and fix it and they said it would take another 45 minutes to remake so my husband went and picked it up and they didn't compensate for the mess up or thge delivery charge..Then they took our wrong order back and put it in the warmer for someone else to get ,that was clearly contaminated!I couldn't believe it! Scammy people!And how unclean...To think someone else may have touched my food like that freaks me out!I will not be going back .I don't want to get food poisoning and it's not like it's any cheaper than a good Italian pizzeria! BEWARE PEOPLE!"}
{"text":"Pizza was decent, better than what I expected after seeing the condition of the store. Dining room was not clean and had more people loitering than actual patrons. Would not return to this location nor would I recommend this Pizza Hut to anyone else."}
{"text":"This location need to do better. Every time I order there's always an issue. When I order for pickup something is left off and delivery the pizza is cold. I use to enjoy Pizza Hut, but because this is the closest location to my home, I have not had a decent pizza from Pizza Hut in years. After my previous delivery disappointment, it took my about 6 months to try again. This last experience is my last. I ordered delivery on the website and was given an estimated time of 30 minutes. I received an update 20 minutes after placing my order that my pizza was out for delivery. Being that Pizza Hut Is less than a 2 minute drive from my home I expected my pizza no later that 10 more minutes. After waiting another 25 minutes no pizza, I called and canceled my order. After waiting over an hour, I get a knock from the delivery man. Clearly he didn't get the update. I sent him on his way with his pizza, I'm still waiting for my refund."}
{"text":"If I could give zero stars I would. This is the WORST Pizza Hut ever! A two hour delivery wait for ONE PIZZA and an order of WINGS! Not even Super Bowl Sunday!!!!!!! I always choose Pizza Hut over Dominos until I ordered from this one. Do yourself a favor and save yourself the trouble, go to Dominos or pick up Pizza Hut from another location. This is the WORST! You would think the owner of this location would catch on at some point. Clearly, not."}
{"text":"I placed an order at 6:30pm tonight and JUST now received it. (8:30pm) Now, I could understand if I had ordered for a bunch of people but my order consisted of ONE medium pepperoni pizza and an order of bread sticks. I ordered a hand tossed pizza, what came was close to a thin crust, which is fine, not what I ordered or expected but not upset over it. I'm not going to complain and disregard the positives. There were two positives though, the bread sticks tasted fresh and the delivery driver was very pleasant.

This is not the first time I have had issues with this Pizza Hut. A few months ago, I placed an order online and about five mins later, I get a phone call saying \"We aren't delivering anymore tonight\" This was roughly 7:00pm. This pizza hut is giving ALL Pizza Huts a bad reputation. I do believe I will stick with Marco's Pizza from now on. Sad."}
{"text":"I have order from decatur and hacienda location before , the woman manager have me someone else's receipt , repeatedly told her it was not my order , it was only when I started to walk away she gave me a correct receipt.  Today January 21st of 2018 at 4:33 My order of a pan pizza and breadsticks was deliver on line it said total is $22.19 , when pizza delivery guy arrive he gave me a receipt of $27 and change . I feel that a scam is been run from this store by management and employees they all see knowledgeable about computers and the English language.  Now they have my credit card information hope they don't run my credit card,  reporting them to better business bureau and the news ."}
{"text":"Worst pizza I've ever had. We ordered a Hawaiian pizza (simple) for delivery. The delivery was on Time and the kid was nice enough. However, the pizza was very bad. It honestly was worse than frozen pizzas from smiths. Crust tasted cheap and old. Toppings were sparse. 
Will never return. 

If this place was smart they would get some good management in there and revamp their pizzas; seeing as their only 1 of 3 pizza laces in the area."}
{"text":"Friday night is pizza night at my house and one of our all-time favorites is Pizza Hut. 
Pizza Hut always has amazing specials and you get to create your pizza exactly the way you want it! 
If you're not in the mood for pizza you can have pasta, wings, or you can venture inside to partake of their full-service. 

I'm particularly fond of the Cabarrus Avenue location in Concord because they have a quick service drive through window and the managers and staff are always accommodating and they treat their customers right!"}
{"text":"Ordered 2 pizzas. 1 with meat for my kids, 1 without. Ended up with 2 pepperoni pizzas. Disappointing since I don't eat meat. I ordered online. It's probably best to order in person although the reviews on here don't speak highly of doing so. Otherwise I haven't had any issues with ordering from here."}
{"text":"I love Pizza Hut, and this one has some of the best food I've had, but their service is very slow. There have been times that I walk in and have to wait over 10 MINUTES for someone to come to the counter and take my order. It would have gotten 5 stars if they'd improve on that."}
{"text":"If you want pizza.. go somewhere else unless you pick it up in the store or you are completely okay with waiting for 2 hours to be delivered.  There hasn't been a single time when I have ordered from here that I have got it in a reasonable amount of time.  I have actually waited about two hours before calling in which they informed me that it hasn't even left yet.  They were completely rude and told me that if I wanted it quickly I could drive to come get it.  I could go on and on but seriously, just go elsewhere."}
{"text":"If I could give zero stars I would!  First nobody was working the lobby to take my order of two only two pizzas.  After seven minutes of waiting to give my order, I was told twenty minutes for my order.  I left to pick up the rest of the food for the party.  I returned twenty two minutes later and the pizza was not ready.  At the forty five minute mark my pizza was finally ready and the rest of my food cold.  One of my pizza looked like it had spent twenty minutes under a warming light.  Once again Pizza Hut has lost my business again.  See you in two years, maybe longer this time."}
{"text":"Delivery took 1 hr and 10 mins. Pizza arrived cold. UGH!!!! Asked delivery lady for cheese and red flakes but with hesitation she said she didn't have any on her but she had some in her car. We just told her not to worry about it but still tipped her."}
{"text":"ordered a large pizza online its was doughy crust wadnt golden chicken bites where ok"}
{"text":"Order took two hours to come just for pasta.  They forgot breadsticks and wouldn't send them because they were short on staff. The pasta is my fav but lm very disappointed"}
{"text":"Do not order from this Pizza Hut the worst experience. Ordered a large pepperoni and bacon look like the gave me an extra topping of grease. Also the pizza wasn't full cut through. I would give these guys a 0"}
{"text":"A long wait here for your order. The only bonus was I knew my meal was fresh.

My husband and I split a personal pan pizza and breadsticks. The breadsticks had been sitting there for awhile and was missing that delicious garlic butter. 

I guess for an overprice \"fast food\" meal check it out."}
{"text":"Though the location is very convenient to my house it always has poor service. Whether pick up or delivery the service is always unsatisfactory the hold time and delivery time is extremely long even if not during peak hours. The past three times I've ordered the pizza had been under cooked and uncut. I shouldn't have to recook a pizza that I ordered and it took an hour and a half to receive."}
{"text":"+1 star for delivering on a national holiday (and in the rain). Delivery guy was polite and my pizzas were still hot when he arrived. 

But food-wise, not much to go on here. I submitted my order through the website, and it indicated a one hour wait time, even though the physical store is only like a few miles from me. The actual pizza had far fewer toppings than the website's \"build your own pizza\" animations led me to believe, and the toppings were spread super unevenly, all clumped up in the center of the pizza, leaving the edges with only marinara, cheese and a lot crust. 

Update - found out there was a $4 delivery fee for my order once the charge posted to my account. Initially, I tried calling the store to figure out where the extra charge came from, but I was on hold for 10 minutes before I decided googling would probably get me a faster response. Apparently, this is a mandatory fee set by the store, which wasn't even listed on my original receipt, so -1 star. Actually, I would give them 0 stars if possible. $4 delivery fee plus driver tip is like a 50% of my total bill. Ridiculous.

Don't recommend. Either go pick up your pizza in person, or opt for a better pizza chain without ridiculous hidden charges and bad customer service."}
{"text":"So I order a personal pizza. With tax $3.93. 
Cheap, so I decide to get two. $3.93 x 2 should be $7.86. Instead she tells me $8.45. 

So I actually had to do separate transactions. Which makes no sense. There is something about the math that their registers are doing that is ripping people off. 

Extrapolated to bigger orders, they are cheating people out of hundereds of dollars when people buy more than one thing or two of the same."}
{"text":"The location is a little tight but the food is good for the price, the staff are always friendly and willing to help where they can. The pastas are a little over done but again its called Pizza Hut not Pasta Hut. Overall its a good option for late night grub."}
{"text":"So I placed and online pick up order like always show up at the store at the 20 mins of their 15-25 mins ready time. When I walk in the girl at the counter is on the phone with another customer so I wait patiently for her to end the call. Whill I am waiting I watch another young lady put two pizzas in the hot box (great I think its mine) then take them out and put them into a delivery bag instead. Ok that's weird I thought but whatever, so the girl at the counter is off the phone takes my payment and tells me my pizza isn't ready yet. So I say ok and sit and wait for 15 mins more. At that point I hear another young lady tell the first that the pizza in the delivery bag is a carry out so I ask her if it is mine.... YES....WTF. So at that point the girl gives me my pizza no apologies from the girl that messed up. I told girl at the counter what I had just witnessed and had waited 15 mins on my pizza that were already ready! I head home to feed the kids and call the manager about the situation and he LAUGHS about it WTF IS WRONG WITH YOUR CUSTOMER SERVICE!! He was not professional in the slightest. He offers me a $5 off my next purchase I tell him I'm not looking for free stuff just want them to be more aware of the situation. He continues to laugh throughout our entire conversation. I tell me its not funny and he says well what do you want me to do? You have lost yet another customer because off him. It wouldn't have been such a big deal to me if he didn't laugh the moment I told him the situation."}
{"text":"We haven't ordered from Pizza Hut for a very long time, so with family coming to swim, I hoped for a quick, child friendly dinner. This was THE WORST pizza We've ever had. The cheese stuffed chicken pizza was under cooked and soggy. The veggie pizza was undercooked and soggy. The only thing on the order that was good, was the boneless chicken. $55 wasted on really crappy food."}
{"text":"Helpful, efficient and over all Friendly Staff.
Delivery both times were speedy and the Pizza was warm, fresh and good.
I was really happy with it and will use it again."}
{"text":"This is a combo location and has all three Yum! restaurants in it. On this occasion I enjoyed some delicious Taco Bell. The food was standard as you would expect from any TB. The staff were friendly and had my order out to me quickly. The dining area was clean and well maintained."}
{"text":"Very disappointed. When I placed the order over the phone the young man who took the order was unaware of any specials they were currently having. We finally narrowed the special down to 2 medium, 2 topping pizzas for $5.99 each. I also placed an order for breadsticks with marinara. While ordering, I confirmed with the young man that marinara WAS included with the breadsticks, the young man assured me it was. Upon delivery, my husband asked the delivery driver at the front door if the marinara for the breadsticks was inside one of the pizza boxes. The driver said \"yes, it's in the pizza box.\" We trusted what we were being told. When we got to the kitchen with the pizzas and breadsticks, guess what?! No sign of marinara anywhere. What happened to quality control before leaving the door?"}
{"text":"Ordered veggie pizza with half pepperoni and half chicken added. They covered it in pepperoni which has pork and my wife can't eat! So she couldn't have pizza for dinner. Attention to detail is the key to almost every job. IDIOTS!"}
{"text":"Normally I wouldn't bother to write a review for a Pizza Hut. Or even check in on Yelp. Some secrets are best kept in the family. It's Pizza Hut after all. Everyone knows what they're going to get. 

So what's the motivation this time? I noticed some really bad recent reviews for the carry out location I occasionally use. The workers there, however, are consistently nice and really seem to be trying to do a good job given the limitations that Pizza Hut presents. I just wanted to give them a little \"thumbs up\". 

Three stars, the maximum rating allowed by law for a Pizza Hut."}
{"text":"Do not go here, especially if Phil is the manager on duty. 9 French fries came in an order and he refused to refund my meal!!!! He is cheap, mean and stingy. This Pizza Hut is the worst. The food was disgusting. Order from Dominos or Wing Stop. If you must order from here make sure Phil is NOT the manager on duty."}
{"text":"Every time I order online for delivery, it is at least 30 minutes late. Last night was the most recent occurrence. I had my 7 year old with me and I'm 23 weeks pregnant. We were starving waiting on our food. Finally it had been 20 minutes since put confirmation email had told us or food should have been there, so I caved and called them. The lady on the phone told me they messed up our brownies on the oven, but that they had new brownies in the oven and that we were the next order that they would deliver. Another 25 minutes pass and we finally got our order. I live 10 minutes from their location. They at least could have been the ones to call me and they could have offered me something in return for the extended wait time, but nothing. 

The time before last it was an hour wait and the guy talked to me on the phone like I was an idiot stating that the \"confirmation email\" time was \"different\" from theirs smh."}
{"text":"Time of Order: Thursday 7pm

I was hesitant to order based on Yelp reviews and a bad pizza from here a few years ago, but everyone deserves a second chance, right? I ordered online and that went smoothly; it had a nifty countdown timer to when the order should be delivered and I was happy that it was pretty accurate. 

When the driver got here, I asked if he needed to see my credit card. Uh... it's credit card? Apparently there is some known glitch in the online ordering system that puts it through to the store as a cash order. That's something that definitely needs addressed because if I hadn't had the plastic on me for some reason, I was without cash and would have had to watch my pizza go bye-bye. 

The driver tried to call the store to let me give them my cc # but it just kept playing the pre-recorded promo messages and telling us that the call was very important. Meanwhile the food and humans are getting cold as we're waiting. The driver said he'd give me the pizza and call when he got back to the store, which he did and my cc # was applied without error. I thought that was a nice thing for him to do because he could have said he had to take it back, do the card and re-deliver. 

Oh, are you waiting to hear how the food was? Silly me. I ordered a large \"stuffed garlic knob crust\" with pepperoni, extra mushrooms (yum!), and spinach. The spinach was whole leaf baby spinach, whereas I thought it was going to be cooked, shredded spinach like right on the  pizza. I took most of it off since I didn't want a salad on top of a pizza. There were a lot of fresh mushrooms which I can't get enough of (lots of vitamin D) and so many places now use rubbery canned 'shrooms. The pizza was tasty enough; It's not upscale froo-froo, ooh la la pizza, but it was $20, and choices for delivery in the OHC are few. 

Given that the delivery was timely and considerate &  the pizza was tasty and correct, I'd recommend this Pizza Hut at least during the weeknight, but I wouldn't advise ordering online."}
{"text":"There was a time when Pizza Hut was the best around. Their marinara was always my favorite - we have lived in Indian Land for 5 years and wasn't until recently that we found this Pizza Hut close to us. We were very excited - tonight we ordered 4 pizzas - a supreme, 2 Hawaiian, and a cheese. We ordered take out and went and picked up. Got there as soon as they were coming out of the oven - got home and couldn't wait to dive in... Well.  What the heck happened to Pizza Hut? Very bland - hardly any marinara sauce - pizza was hot and had toppings but the bread for the crust is way different and again, where was the sauce??  Extremely disappointed and he Pizza was simply not good at all. What a shame."}
{"text":"Just don't bother.  Waited on hold for over 15 minutes (at 7:40 pm on a Sunday night) and still no answer. Gonna go ahead and hit up Hungry Howie's instead."}
{"text":"They never deliver to the door. I never gave tip because they don't deserve my money. I am paying for 'delivery' for a reason. Filed a complaint and never got a response. Tacky management."}
{"text":"Nice service. Crappy food. Wifi is not working. Went here for dinner. May come  again to try lunch buffet."}
{"text":"This location was very bad many years ago: dirty, food that was never fresh, and poor customer service. A few years ago, they renovated and changed things up, but, recently, it has reverted. It is inexcusable how yet another Pizza Hut in The GTA has gone by the wayside. This location is never clean from inside, there is always one waiter sleeping in the restaurant at any given time, and the vegetables are never fresh, leading to massive food poisoning if you eat them. 

Delivery from this location is another story. The most recent delivery a few weeks ago entailed having a delivery man come to the door WITH CIGARETTE IN MOUTH. Further, the pizza that was delivered was completely \"disassembled\" from inside, toppings all over the place, cold, sauce all over the place. God forbid you order vegan pizza from this location, it is disastrous. 

May God have mercy on your stomachs from days of food poisoning if you eat from this location. The Pizza Huts in GTA are in general disastrous from a quality and cleanliness perspective, and this location has now joined them. Shame!"}
{"text":"AWFUL! My delivery was 25 mins late. On top of that the driver refused to get out of his car  and deliver the pizza because he was afraid of getting a ticket. My friend and I walked around for 15 mins looking for him because he said he was waiting in the lobby, meanwhile he was sitting in his car.

The pizza itself was cold and burnt. I couldn't believe how small the sizing is scaled - the large could feed maybe two people. Who aren't that hungry.

I get that it's a new location but come on! The manager I called could barely speak English and kept repeating the same thing over and over until I finally hung up.

Wow. Seriously. WOW."}
{"text":"I spent 80 dollars worth of pizza and your gonna tell me you're out of peppers, napkins and cheese? This is ridiculous!!!!"}
{"text":"Ordered at 10:06p and got an email saying 30 minutes to delivery. It's now 30 minutes after they closed, no pizza, won't answer the phone, and of course they charged my card... ??? Really! Very disappointed, been eating Pizza Hut for years and this is so upsetting."}
{"text":"I went to the restroom in the Luxor restaurant. I noticed and employee a Pizza Hut not wash their hands as they exit the restroom. I went to the manager of the Pizza Hut. And the employee confess that he didn't wash his hands that he only use hand sanitizer her. When I complain the manager just shrugged his shoulders and asked if I had ordered some food there. My quoteto him was \"I didn't order anything here hell no!\" Because I wasn't going to get contagious diseases from an employee not washing their hands. So I made sure to tellThe customers online that the only employee making pizzas did not wash his hands. The manager told me to quiet down. I said I wasn't going to quiet down that these customer should be aware that their employee didn't wash his hands and he was the only cook on duty."}
{"text":"Ordered pizza online at 1:11pm and the estimated delivery time was 2:45pm. Really? Dominos and Papa Johns delivers in 45min or less. Sorry Pizza Hut..you have been permanently replaced."}
{"text":"Typical Pizza Hut pizza, greasy with average toppings. Wish they would come back with the lasagna, and their bone-out wings are OK, usually dried out. I only go here in a desperate pinch, when I don't want to wait for Papa Johns to deliver. Delivery guys are kind of snooty."}
{"text":"It's all about the crust!

I have my occasional cravings for Pizza Hut pizza when I want the type of crust they make which is more like toasted bread than pizza dough.

We stopped by for a late night pick up of Pizza and the order was ready pretty quickly.
I must say the prices are a little higher than the competition but they were very generous with the ingredients!

Needless to say my family gobbled up the 2 pizzas within 10 mins..."}
{"text":"Pizza Hut is my once in a while (usually late night!) indulgence when my modern wife doesn't want to cook....
I can't add too much more because being part of a chain, the pizza is predictably decent.
I like the Pizza Hut crust which is different from the competitors.
You have to try it for yourself to see or rather taste what I mean!"}
{"text":"2 hours for two medium pepperoni pizzas!!! Ugh can not express enough how frustrating this is ridiculous. Never again!"}
{"text":"Order a pizza  for delivery. The $10 special, looked good on TV. It was the WORST pizza that I have EVER had. The thin crust was thicker than the topping, the very minimal topping, little sauce, very little cheese, thin amount of topping. After ONE bite, we boxed it up and went out to get something to eat. Absolutely Horrible."}
{"text":"couldn't tell you what the food tastes like cause Ive been waiting over two hours for my pizza. this is the worst service i have ever experienced. now will be sticking to dominos"}
{"text":"My pizza was 30 minutes late and when I called I was told the pizza guy left 10 minutes ago and she said \"can you wait\"? and please keep in mind I'm less than five minutes away from this location. Needless to say I will not be ordering from them again.."}
{"text":"Pizza was decent but what successful business doesn't accept $50 bills in the store. I understand delivery but in store is ridiculous"}
{"text":"I'm not about this place at all. Ordered a couple medium pizzas and wings. The medium was like an extra small... with dinky little slices. The dough was burnt and the whole thing tasted off. They were all like that so kudos on consistency?"}
{"text":"I just moved to the area and I have ordered from this location twice... Both times our hand tossed pizza showed up as a thin crust! I have ordered this same pizza at our other location several times and the thickness was perfect! Our pizza was so thin that it could not even stay together on the ride over. Guess I'll try the local Papa Johns."}
{"text":"They screwed up my order more than once for a panzo and when I tried to use store credit a day later since they wouldn't refund me they claimed I was lying about the return until a better employee came around and fixed the problem. I hope that employee finds a better place to work because the management and older staff here are horrible people to deal with and are visibly angry towards almost everyone. This mall needs a better pizza place to come in and drive these guys out because they have no empathy or care for the customers. It gets worse with the apparently cheap owner not hiring enough staff for bloody New Years Eve deliveries and my delivery that day for a small order was 2 hours late until they called and said it would take another hour! I ordered from a Pizza Pizza further away and I got my food within half an hour, this Pizza Hut locations quality is unacceptable and the owner should learn to manage his business better or retire."}
{"text":"Chaos!!!! Phone ringing the entire time, was told pizza was in the oven, to find out 20 min later it was being made and not in oven! I'm still sitting here 35min later. Disappointing...  Will stick with Blaze or Joeys for pizza..."}
{"text":"Back in the day, there was nothing better than a pizza party at Pizza Hut after a soccer/baseball game.  I remember the pan pizza was delicious and everyone seemed to enjoy themselves.  It was something \"special\" to look forward to.  Fast forward 25-30 years, and when I hear the word \"Pizza Hut\", I immediately think of \"cheap, low quality, cardboard tasting crust etc\".  I had ordered Pizza Hut maybe 10 years ago while living in San Diego, and it was the nastiest pizza I think I could have ordered (Later in life, Papa Johns has said, \"Hold my beer!\").

I was browsing through some websites, and found out that Tuesday September 5th was \"National Cheese Pizza Day\" and Pizza Hut had a Large Cheese Pizzas for only $5.00!  Shit, for $5.00, even it was nasty and I only ate one slice, it wouldn't be horrible to take a flyer on it, right?  I placed my order online and drove down to pick it up. 

When I walked in, my name was lights.....literally!  They have an electronic sign at the registers and it had my name in big bold letters \"Pizza ready for Timothy S.\"  It was like when you step off the plane and have a car service guy waiting there with a cardboard sign.  I felt special ;-).  I paid the man my $5.43, he opened up my pizza box to show me the goods, and I was on my way.  I took it out to my car, found a shady spot to park in, and dug in.  Here is how it was..............

Large Pan Cheese Pizza-  I had gotten a glimpse of this pizza when the guy opened the box for me.  It looked alright.  It was 8 slices of plain cheese, pan pizza.  I took a bite of my first slice and was actually decently surprised.  It was different than what I had remembered it tasting like back in the day (the crust was thinner and not as dense, it had less cheese than normal, BUT it was less greasy also), but it was still ok.  The sauce was alright...had a little sweetness to it.  The cheese was nice and stringy and the crust had a light airy texture to it.  I ate 4 slices of it and was full.  

I had planned on giving away the other 4 slices to a homeless person but it did not work out...side rant....Why is it that whenever you WANT to give something to a homeless person (food, water, whatever...) you can never find one?  I PURPOSELY drove around for a good 15 minutes in/around Bell between 35th and 19th Ave and didn't spot one freaking homeless dude (there are ALWAYS homeless people in this area).  Lame.  I wound up taking it back to work and giving it to one of my coworkers to polish off.

Overall, I liked it better than I thought I would have.  For $5.00, it was one hell of a deal, and well worth it.  Was it as good as Little Caesars Deep Dish lunch combo for $5.00?  No.  Was it better than a Little Caesars \"Hot and Ready\"?  Yes!  I don't know if I would pay over $5.00 for a Pizza Hut pizza, but for what it was, I was happy with it.  It brought back some memories and was a filling lunch on the cheap!  A-OK in my book!"}
{"text":"While running errands tonight, my boyfriend and I figured we'd place an order on pizza huts mobile app and swing by the drive-thru on our way home.  

We ordered 2 orders of boneless wings (buffalo mild and garlic parm), along with an order of cheesy bread.  When we got to the window, we were told to go onto their website and give them great reviews (which I cannot find anywhere on the website to contact management or main office).  I googled it, and the link wasn't found.. Go figure.  We were also told that there was an extra, free order of wings in our bag.  Excited as we were, we tipped.. And we usually don't on drive-thru.

As my boyfriend started on his buffalo wings, I dug into my garlic parm wings.  First bit.. Ok.  I take my next bite and spit it out because my wing was very chewy.  I cut into another wing and it tastes funky.  I investigate my wing a bit and it looks pink.  While I'm investigating my wing, My boyfriend spits of piece of his out.  I had asked what was wrong and he said his was chewy.  So now, my boyfriend is paranoid about his wings now and investigates his.. Couldn't tell if it was pink like mine was, but after another bite, still was chewy.  

I opened up our free set of wings, which were garlic parm.  I go to cut the wing in half to make sure everything was cooked ok and couldn't cut through.  So, Pizza Hut gave us a free set of wings, but with the bone in.  Gah!  Totally bummed.  After this point, we were hungry, not even for the rest of our garlic bread.

We took our food out to the kitchen for some better light and I'm glad we didn't eat anymore.  Our wings were so undercooked, I was coughing and gagging so much.  I literally thought I was going to throw up.  

I took some pictures of the wings, the difference between the bone in (darker brown- a little more cooked) compared to the undercooked wings that were completely red inside :(. Can't figure out how to post photos and I don't think anyone would want to see.  I still gag by looking at them."}
{"text":"I ordered pizza tonight and both pizzas very literally thrown in the box. I've never received a pizza like that and the delivery girl was making excuses \"we are busy and rushing.\""}
{"text":"Avoid at all costs. Inedible pizza. Received it at room temperature at best. The brownie we ordered was so mushy that it wouldn't come out of the pan in one piece, it came out in pieces. Ordered a hand tossed crust and received something more along the lines of an inedible, thin crust. The employees had no idea about a product that was being advertised on their website, and they said our order wasn't ready while it was sitting there right behind them. I've never had problems with Pizza Hut and I decided to give this location a try since it is the one closest to me after moving. I definitely wish I hadn't!"}
{"text":"Noisy kitchen, shouting cooks, broken and smelly washrooms. 
Like the pizza- would do only take outs"}
{"text":"My rating is based solely off the food. I did not eat in, rather I called in my order and went to pick it up. When I got home I was to share the pizza with two others. Let's just say an hour later only one slice of the pie had been eaten. My 9 year old could have made a better pie. It was disgusting to say the least. However, it is my belief that the quality is based off the ingredients they are using. I would guess they have changed suppliers to perhaps save money and it shows. Actually the quality of Pizza Hut has gone down over the years which is why it's not my place of choice often. And not to bash just Pizza Hut because Domino's and Papa Johns are not fair behind. Get it together Pizza Hut or get out of the game!"}
{"text":"This has to be the worst pizza hut location i have been to. I was told the wait time would be 15 minutes. I ended up waiting almost 30 mins which was inconvenient. The cashier wasnt all that bright and asked the same questions multiple times. Its not hard to take an order. While i was waiting you could clearly hear the workers using obscenities and laughing and just being totally unprofessional. I know its not the best job in the world but take some pride and at least try to act like a decent human being while on the job. The place in general was not clean.  This will be the last time i come to this location for pizza.  Poor customer service, poor quality pizza. Pizza hut needs to consider the type of people they hire to represent their company."}
{"text":"Worst pizza hut ever. The last 3 orders I have gotten from them something was wrong. Wont be back!"}
{"text":"Once a week, I get to pound the carbs and I was totally jonsing for some Pizza Sliders.  I have been thinking about them for the last couple of weeks.  They look so good on the commercials.  But, I snoozed on getting them... so, now, they don't have them anymore.  But, because my buddies didn't want to drive all over \"creation\", we decided to pick up a couple of pizzas while we were here.  So, here is my review from tonight.

This Pizza Hut is on the corner of Flamingo and Boulder Hwy.  It's not in the best part of town but, all that really means is - you have to lock your car doors while you are inside.  

We walk in and that is when I heard the bad news...  \"Sorry, we stopped carrying pizza sliders a couple of weeks ago\".  After throwing a fit... just kidding... after accepting the news, We decided to order a medium thin crust  pizza with mushrooms and olives and a large thin crust with 1/2 sausage and 1/2 pepperoni..  

After we ordered we had a bit of a wait... that's what we get for not calling ahead.  We sat there and talked a while.  As we were waiting, I looked around and noticed that this place was extremely clean.  I, having a small bladder, had to use the bathroom and it too was really clean.  The only problem is you have to get the key from the counter.

I also like that they have a board up front where you can see how long you have before your order is ready.  That is a nice touch.  

So, as far as Pizza Huts go, this one gets 4 stars.  I prefer other pizza joints for better food but this place gives great service with a smile."}
{"text":"Had a hard time getting the pizza delivered. First ordered online and didn't get the food so we called in to see what was up then they said the order wasn't placed but I got an email confirmation that the order was put in? Took a while for them to deliver the pizza after that.

 Also they charged us $28 when the online order said it would only be $23 to have it delivered and didn't give us any sauce with the breadsticks.

They're ok....... the honey bbq chicken was the savior lol."}
{"text":"Dude what the hell!!! Are you serious my pizza,I had an order of one ya (1) pepperoni pizza at 9:01 pm and they said they were gonna call me ba co and guess what not pizza or call came up  really this is just bad all the way around"}
{"text":"Service here is horrible if you fine in expect a slow and unimpressive experience the service is definitely commensurate with the price as for the food Pizza Hut is the same all over I'm sure you know how it tastes by now"}
{"text":"If there was a way to give negative stars , this individual franchised location would receive negative -100. Not only did the pizza come late but the pizza was uncooked in the middle and the cookie was over cooked. There went my Saturday cheat night to this garbage Pizza Hut. I will never eat this garbage again EVER , with the horrible customer service delivery and rather then correct the employees attention to detail the gentlemen Steve and his wife Michele played the blame game on it not being a corporate store and it's not their responsibility for the process of refunding the mistake of their employees. Do not Waste your money or time!"}
{"text":"Order A pizza at 930, 1000 I get a notification saying its on its way...  At 1030 they call saying they are not going to delivery my pizza because they want me to order it from a different location that is farther away..  Let me add this place is 1.2 of a mile away.. Terrible"}
{"text":"no star!!! ordered the $19.99 big box, it came 35 mins late after the promised time! the food was COLD!!! how??? it's only .5 mile from my house!!! the pizza tasted greasy and cardboard box, the wings was cold and dry!!!"}
{"text":"The worst customer service ever. I called to place a carry out order. I asked for the 2 medium 2 topping deal for $5.99 each. I asked for extra cheese on 1 pizza and extra cheese and pepperoni on the other. She said that was fine and told me my order would be ready in 15 mins. I take my time leaving the house, giving them about 20 minutes to make my order. I get to Pizza Hut, somehow my order is $17.28. I asked the guy at the counter why and he said the extra cheese makes it extra, I go along with it because I just want my food. After I pay he says it will be 2 minutes. I proceed to wait 10 minutes. When the guy comes back out I just ask for my money back due to the fact that I was not only overcharged but now have wait twice as long as they told me and the pizza still isn't ready. He doesn't know what to do so he goes in the back and I proceed to wait another 5 minutes until another lady comes out and refunds my money. I will never come back to this place again."}
{"text":"Quick and fast, especially for a Saturday night. Cheap price and the delivery driver was awesome. Will absolutely order from again !!!"}
{"text":"I am torn between giving it 3 and 4 stars. It fills a niche that places like Cibo and The Parlor could never fill. [Rounding up from 3.5 stars]

I've ordered pizza and/or wings here more times than I care to admit. They always have very reasonable prices and plenty of coupons and specials. And I have to say that tipsy or sober I have never had an issue with food quality or service. Everyone here has been friendly and when they say my order will be ready for pick up in 20-30 minutes it almost always is. 
Whether I order online, call in just before leaving work or dial them up from across the street as I sit at the bar, when I arrive my order it hot and ready. 

I have a thing for their wings, the crunchy ones with the new spicy Asian sauce or just plain, especially at 1230 after the kitchen at Turf has closed by midnight and I'm at least 2, going on 3, sheets to the wind and my initial plan of drinking my dinner isn't working out. 

The wonderfully thick and greasy pan pizza crust is the best late at night or for brunch the day after a night out. Their thin and crispy crust is generally my favorite. 
Ok and I admit it...some girls binge on ice cream when they are depressed. I like Pizza Hut pizza. [Much better than Domino's, Papa Johns, Peter Piper or Little Cesar's]"}
{"text":"Ordered multiple times from this Pizza Hut location, and were consistently unimpressed. The service was decent and the delivery guys were friendly enough, but they never got the pizza to us either fast or hot (which, in effect, may well have been one in the same had they been on the ball).
The pizzas we received with each order had obviously either sat in the restaurant for longer than they should prior to dispatch, or had been in whatever Pizza Hut calls their keep-warm sleeves they transport the pies in. The service times were also notably slower than other delivery joints in the area--I'm not going to compare Pizza Hut to Jimmy John's or somewhere that prides itself on super-speedy service of things that don't require baking, but Domino's was far superior in both timeframe and quality of delivered goods, for instance--and overall, I was far less impressed with this Pizza Hut than I was with... well, everyone else.
When we moved into their service area, we first noticed that the service was slower than it had been on the other side of town from a different location. Having called in orders to both, I realize that they had longer hold times as well, which could account for longer delivery times, but if all the pizzas are getting baked and ready but not getting delivered while the cheese is still hot and stringy on a consistent basis, you either need to wait another couple of minutes before throwing the next batch of pizzas through the oven, or hire more drivers. If you're doing the amount of business that requires a five-minute hold time on the telephone, you can afford another driver for rush situations, right?
Overall, we stopped ordering from this Pizza Hut and started ordering from Domino's. Quality was better, speed of service was better. Which means that they're doing the job of pizza delivery better, end of story."}
{"text":"I don't think their pizza is worth $40 for two larges before you even tip the driver on any scale, but I was lazy, hadn't had pizza in a long time, and they had a new menu.  I regretted it. The other reason for my low rating... I ordered online and chose a future delivery time of 8 pm. Around 8:45, I called them after confirming that I had been charged for the pizzas. They said he should be there any minute, because he left at 7:49. We live within three miles. He showed up ten minutes later and look stoned out of his mind. Smoke whatever you want, it's your life, but don't do it while my food gets cold in your car."}
{"text":"I never received my delivery order that he placed online and I waited two hours over the timeframe that they had given me"}
{"text":"Incredibly rude staff. Rude and disrespectful. With so many other options in the area, there is no reason to subject yourself to this. Average delivery time is over an hour, even if you are 2.5 miles away."}
{"text":"I don't know how anybody can give this place more than one star. Food is NEVER ready when they say it will be. Staff is rude an unapologetic. Pizza tastes mediocre at best. I gave them three tries. Three strikes you're out. I won't be back."}
{"text":"Absolutely the worst experience ever. Went with my daughter. Stood waiting for a table for ten minutes with nobody coming up and the place was empty. There was a waitress with a crying baby in the kitchen who was ignoring us. I ask twice at takeout window for help but was ignored. Skip this place!"}
{"text":"Friendly staff. Made me a stuffed crust double beef and chicken pizza in about 10 minutes. This dude is making Pizza Hut great again."}
{"text":"Some of the best pizzas is made at Pizza Hut. This particular branch provides great pizza and an excellent lunch buffet.

When you eat the lunch buffet, they alternate regular and dessert pizzas, and you can really sample all these different types of pizzas they have. It's incredible."}
{"text":"We just moved to Buckeye, (Verrado) and was experience was awesome, Yes its in Downtown Buckeye, not a nice place to say the least, but its worth the experience."}
{"text":"I love pizza hut.   And I especially love their lunch buffet.   Soooo much pizza, so little time!! 

And they include yummy dessert pizzas on the lunch buffet too.   For such a great price, I mean, how can you beat $9 for pizza? 

And there are salads, and a baked pasta dish that's yummy too. 

Geez,  I haven't been in a while,  I need to go back!!"}
{"text":"The employees look lost. I ordered very very simple. 3 pizzas and 36 wings. None of the pizzas were cooked all the way thru and they only gave me 18 wings. I went back and they apologized and gave me some cold wings. Needless to say I will drove an extra ten minutes and go up the street. Just horrible"}
{"text":"I was stunned at what this assembly line calls 'bacon.'  Stunned!

I ordered a pizza with double bacon (strips) - and the IDIOTS put the bacon on TOP of the cheese - so - of course - it burned!  BLACK!

And even worse - the bacon was BY FAR, the THINNEST bacon I've EVER seen - IN MY LIFE.

What they 'call' bacon was about as thin as a sheet of paper.  I mean - if it wasn't black - you could probably see through it.  It was THAT thin.  Like - I mean - 4 times thinner than the thinnest bacon I've ever seen.  Ever.

Now - if the bacon wasn't so shockingly thin, and it was with the other toppings - under the cheese, then, maybe - it might have been edible.

Sad.  Pathetic."}
{"text":"This probably the worse Pizza Hut, I've been 2

I Order online, when I got there the pizza was hard and cold. I probably should of got a frozen pizza.

They must recycle pizza to keep from wasting it."}
{"text":"Worst pizza hut ever. Ordered pizza for delivery over 2 hours ago and called THREE times and still NO PIZZA.  worst place ever.  Do not waste time ordering from here."}
{"text":"There is huge different with quality of the pizza at this location compare to the other pizza huts. They just dont make the properly. They are ruining the name for pizza hut. They don't know how to run it properly and the staff there not friendly either. If other pizza huts near by have any deals, this store won't have it. Pizza hut head office should get rid of these people who are running it."}
{"text":"I stopped by the Pizza Hut for lunch. Service was really good. Pizza came out pretty quickly and also got an order of the medium buffalo wings. Was worried they would be rubbery but they weren't. Place had a pretty good lunch crowd. Had not eaten at a Pizza Hut in a long time and was pleasantly surprised by entire experience"}
{"text":"Their website malfunctions ALL the time and when you call in to place your order AFTER you've wasted your time, they don't want to honor your coupon code, which I have because I buy so much damn pizza from this location because they say \"it's only valid online.\" You may want to prioritize customer service Pizza Hut because you clearly lack it from you yelp reviews BEFORE I even left mine. I don't care if your affiliated with the website you are a Pizza Hut that offers online ordering which is convenient for most of us. I hope management reads this and gets their sh*t together. I can only hope it's the young kids answering the phones that are not trained to take care of their customers but hey, who knows, this may be a management issue to. Congratulations, you've just lost another loyal customer"}
{"text":"Wow, this place is horrible!!!
I placed an online order for pickup and took advantage of their wings promotion as I was craving wings and didn't have time to either make my own or go to my favorite wing places.

I arrived at the location 5 minutes after of my estimated carryout time and the counter was very busy, understandably it was dinner time on a long weekend. However, even with two people working the cash only one was seemed to be serving pickup orders and she was taking way too long chatting with a relative who was there to pickup an order. 

The food was extremely disappointing. I ordered a side Caesar salad, a regular order of garlic bread with cheese and 8 wings and it came to $15.57. While normally this is a reasonable price but it did not taste very good, the portions of the garlic bread and salad were small and the Caesar dressing packet was warm which I didn't attempt to use as the packet said to keep refrigerated, which I also question the safe storage of the salad which I noticed that my entire food order was stored under the counter of the cash for who knows how long and stored with hot food. Also this is from a fast food chain which I expect better value especially at this poor level of quality.
With the 60 cent wing promotion, even at this price it was not worth it. The wings were soggy and overly battered and swimming in a pool of hot sauce. While the sauce was hot it lacked any other kind of flavor. 
I also can't believe I paid $3.99 for two pieces of mediocre garlic bread with cheese, what a rip off! I could've gone across the street to the Kitchen Table market and pickup enough garlic bread to feed a family and made it much better for the same price!

While I didn't eat my salad, I still couldn't finish my 8 wings and two pieces of garlic bread because it was so bad.

I tried to file a complaint to Pizza Hut Canada's consumer service contact page, but that page was conveniently not working.
There are many places around the city that make excellent wings which deserves your business and definitely worth the cost of delivery.
What a waste of 15 bucks! AVOID THIS PIZZA HUT!"}
{"text":"Okay, we all have those little glitches, no one's perfect, we all crave those guilty pleasures, mine is the hut. Come on, even bad pizza can be good, my taste buds are geared towards a certain taste of pizza. The hut hits my spot! 

\"But Joe, didn't you give five stars to Beto's?\" you might be thinking and the answer is yes! There are different pizzas out there, friends. Pull up a chair and let me teach you Pizza 101. 

I grew up eating my grandmother's amazing pizza on home made bread dough, fresh tomato and parmesan cheese, that was it, no toppings, just Italian goodness. Dad loved DeSalla's pizza on Warrington, square, airy dough, almost like stale bread, not my favorite but it was pizza none the less. Beto's was my favorite, love or hate it, Beto's will be another of my guilty pleasures, warm bread, warm tomatoes, cold cheese! Yummo. There's flatbread, pizza served with salad on it, pesto pizza, generic corner shop pizza, etc. 

Which leads me to Pizza Hut. Now, you can be a pizza snob, you can turn your nose up at a Hut pie. But I'd walk a mile for a stuffed crust pan pizza with black olives, bacon, sausage and pepperoni. Don't think that there's ever enough cheese either, pass me that cheese shaker and the red pepper flakes, don't get your fingers near my mouth because this is my guilty pleasure. The Hut does it right, the perfect thickness in crust, chewy and crispy, the cheese blend leaves your mouth watering for the next bite, the toppings are plentiful and the oven lets them release all their umami goodness. That first bite, after waiting so long for a Hut fix is like finally sneezing after not being able to. 

Pizza Hut is also one of the all time great cold breakfast pizzas, but even better when nuked for about 20 seconds in the microwave. Worth burning your tongue for. So yes, Pizza Hut is my religion, it's maybe a once a year pleasure I allow myself. You have to enjoy life once in awhile!"}
{"text":"Horrible service. Ordered online and there was no verification that a 1+ hour wait was ok. No way to cancel. Actually too 1:35 minutes, was cold, undercooked wings, pizza wasn't even fully cut (needed a knife). Called to complain and all the manager said was that it got a little crazy. We'd be crazy to go back..."}
{"text":"We order from here all the time. But it has become the same thing over and over again.

Delivering cold pizza is not a good idea.

A remake or a credit for another cold pizza isn't the way to win me over either.

Hire more people if you're that busy and stop giving excuses."}
{"text":"Disgusting. Nasty. Shameful. 

Worst PizzaHut I have ever tried. I have been to PizzaHut in over +5 countries and over 15 cities, and frankly, this one is by far the worst. 

Where to start? It took them 80 min to make and deliver one Pizza. The pizza was delivered 35 min after it was done- even tho the store is 5 min drive. The pizza itself was cold - like ice cold. And the crust? There was no crust really. It was a paper thin stuffed crust pizza. Since when Pizzahut's crust is that thin? The toppings were burned, and the crust was flavorless. 

Never ever ever again order from that store. I am sure an earthquake must have hit Italy when they thought they can sell that nasty disgusting pile for sh*t as pizza"}
{"text":"Food 3 stars.  Services +0.5 star.  Overall 3.5 stars.

I always like American pizzas ever since Americans give the world Hawaiian pizzas (pineapples and ham).  This Pizza Hut location gives customers what they expect: extra sauce, extra cheese, lots of meat toppings, clean environment, high tolerance of chaos from children.  I appreciate all servers who work in family friendly restaurants; their patience is tested every shift.  

We celebrated a child's birthday on a Saturday at this location.  The restaurant was half full.  We ordered two large pizzas, plus garlic breadsticks, salad and a pitcher of soda.  The server was so proactive.  He voluntarily suggested us to order the combo special which came with 2 pizzas, an order of breadstick and a pitcher.  We only needed to add a salad on top, and it would cost less.  I was delighted by his services level.  The food came fast and hot.  Everything tasted good, or as good as any Pizza Hut.  The server was accommodating about refrigerating the birthday cakes until end of meal.  He provided us with plates, forks and napkins, all on the house.  We were so happy with his attentive services that we tipped extra-extra.   :-)"}
{"text":"Good Pizza Hut location.  I have had this pizza a few times now and every time has bee really good.  I'm not sure why there are so many negative reviews, but my experience has been great.  Very quick delivery and always hot food!  Thanks guys keep up the good work it is noticed!!"}
{"text":"Pizza Hut is always my go to when I'm craving pizza well this time I wish I never ordered from them! The pizza was extra soggy!!! It wasn't even hot when it got delivered and I only live 3min from this location! I was very disappointed when it got delivered! I would of rather paid $20 to order from Dominos."}
{"text":"Do not order from them and save yourself  from waiting forever. They do not even deserve  one star."}
{"text":"Despite the reviews I thought to try myself because as a kid I always loved Pizza Hut pizza. Unfortunately both of the times I've ordered from this location I've been disappointed. The first time it was 30 minutes Late. This most recent time was worse. I ordered a basic pepperoni pizza, thin and crispy as they promote it. However, it was thin and soggy. The entire bottom slid my pizza was drenched in oil. It was not crispy, it was floppy and extremely soggy to the point all I could taste was oil. I took a pic to share. You'd think with all these bad reviews they would correct their errors."}
{"text":"Last time I ordered a pizza from here, the next day I got an e-mail from the company apologizing that my order was late and offering me a free large pizza. I didn't even realize they were late, looking back maybe 10 minutes later than usual but I don't care as long as it comes hot (which it always does). Anyways I decided to use the free pizza coupon yesterday as I've been sick and not able to cook for my son. Figured there was going to be some stupid rule with the coupon like you have to pay the additional charge for stuffed crust or something. I was pleasantly surprised that I was able to get the same pizza I always order and it was in fact free. Got some bread sticks, cinnamon sticks and a 2-liter as well and only paid 16 dollars (before tip). Not only that but I always leave a note for the driver to bring napkins, as I never have any at home, and he brought napkins, plates, and cheese and peppers. Great customer service! Keep it up!"}
{"text":"I get the rating now, took over an hour and a half to receive one pizza and it was cold, paid more for extra cheese, looked like the same amount as regular. I wouldn't think a Monday would be busy so I don't get the delay. Oh well."}
{"text":"Husband placed an order for delivery. Considering we are just blocks away, the fact that we waited a long time didn't make much sense. I reluctantly tried a slice even though I've had less than stellar experiences before with them. Of course, the pizza was highly disappointing. I believe he ordered the hand-tossed. Very bready... too much bread... doughy almost. Nope, not for me."}
{"text":"They're always pleasant when I call. I appreciate their patience and friendly service. I get its just Pizza Hut, but good customer service seems rare these days. They have been consistently pleasant every time we've ordered. I have to edit my review. I do still agree that they're pleasant when you call. Past few orders have been messed up. From crust to forgetting our drinks. Darien, the manager did offer to replace my meal items that they had messed up on. When I called back for them the attitude was a little different, but he stuck to his word. So I will give him that. It's not about getting anything for free. It's about principle and that I paid for my items to be the way I ordered originally. I think ultimately the service is good and if a mistake is made on orders. It really is proper customer service to accommodate that and not act like its a favor. Fixing a paying customers order is customer service. It's appreciated. Don't make people fee like its a hand out when they're already paid for their food."}
{"text":"Hadn't been there for awhile and the minute I walked in I remembered why! The manager(?), an older Asian woman is rude, has no clue what she is doing and disheveled looking! I left before I paid and I will never go back there!"}
{"text":"In the heart of the Cherry neighborhood, this location is convenient for Carolinas Healthcare employees. Be careful though as parking is coveted and tight!

A typical carry out spot, it's clean and staff is friendly. I love the lunch personal pan combo with a drink that's less than $7. A cheap and quick lunch."}
{"text":"Wanted to try the garlic knots crust pizza. Very slow when I arrived at the time my online order said to arrive at 9:40pm on a Monday night. Two other people were waiting. I was never once greeted by an employee and it took over 25 mins to receive my order. Probably won't be returning to this location."}
{"text":"They had an amazing online deal I used to get fifty percent off my pizza! I got a large pizza, pasta, wings, garlic Knots, and bread sticks all for forty dollars. Amazing prices and everything was so delicious!"}
{"text":"I know most don't care for Pizza Hut pizza but I've always been a fan.  However,  this location is destroying the brand.  I try over and over to give them \"the benefit of the doubt\" but I think they've burned me for the last time. 
It's not the mistakes that they make over and over but how rudely they address me and other customers.  There's a Domino's directly across the street that I go to, but I'd much rather give my money to pizza Hut.  I don't know if it's worth the 50/50 gamble of my order being totally messed up."}

I have had the incredible misfortune of eating a two different Pizza Huts at two completely different locations, the latest at this particular one.  They both mirror the exact same issues.  

I ordered the exact same pizza, a pan pizza with sausage and pepperoni.  There was hardly ANY, and I mean any cheese.  By this I mean there wasn't enough cheese on there to even cover the top of the pizza!  The other toppings were equally as scarce.  There was virtually NO pepperoni or sausage.  Some bites (and I got a big mouth!) had no topping at all.  Seriously!  

i remember as a kid how good Pizza Hut was.  Even since moving to the pizza capital of the world, Chicago (head bow!) I occasionally had a taste for a good old Pizza Hut greasy but good pan pizza.  This pizza no longer exists.  Pizza Hut mortuus est.... Pizza Hut is dead, may it die a quick and painful death."}
{"text":"Love this pizza hut!  I used to be called Pizza Hut Bistro and served all kinds of great, authentic pizza along with the usual Pizza Hut fare.  I haven't been in year so i am not sure if they still do, but they had a wonderful buffet, great service and tons of seating."}
{"text":"Ordered pizza and it's been an hour now since the expected delivery time and it's still not here. I called and they said I left the wrong phone number on file which doesn't make any sense because I got text updates to my number. So if I gave them the wrong number how are they sending me updates to my phone?"}
{"text":"I see all these bad reviews but I have been going to this location for awhile now and I have never had a problem with them. I have ordered online, called in, and walked in a few times and not once have I had an issue.   The times have always been accurate and food has always tasted delicious! Especially when we have last minute dinner runs. :-)"}
{"text":"Lack of customer service made a slitely annoying situation into an infuriating one.  

I do not like pizza Hut pizza to begin with,  but the gf and I decided to try the cheesy bites pizza.  We ordered online and when the order arrived we received a cheese pan pizza. (which is 10.59....ridiculous)  when I called the not so friendly representative informed me that he \"didn't know what to tell\"  me.  Because we did the order online the error wasn't theirs he said.  He had a complete lack of empathy or customer service at all.  
After a couple tries of making him understand how I felt,  and getting no where, I told him I didn't accept his answer and I didn't want this pizza.  The phone went silent....  \"are you still there?\"..............  More silence.  Just as I was about to hang up and drive down there to speak to a manager he came back.  Apparently I was on hold?  He then informed me that his manager said they would replace the pizza,  but they would be picking up the original pizza.  Ok by me,  I don't want it,  but the accusatory tone just made me even more upset.  
Thank you for solidifying my dislike of pizza hut, now there never has to be a question  as to whether we should try it out or not."}
{"text":"Sometimes, the morning (or midday) after a night out, you want something greasily predictable.  And I mean that in the best of ways.  Enter - after a 10 year pause in our relationship - The Hut.
 
When you're rough and can only communicate with monosyllables...this really hits the spot.  \"Pizza\" \"Please\" \"Large\" \"Credit\" \"Thanks\"
 
Despite mixed feelings about canned olives, and regular bypassing of meat on pizza...I ended up with a green olive and pepperoni pie.  WHAA?!? My liver and I have different needs, I guess.  Greasy, doughy, briney, salty.  Predictable.  Efficient.  The perfect cure. 
 
I will be remembering you next groggy morning after, Pizza Hut.  Thanks for being there. 
 
Yelp note: bypass the stuffed crust!  Dare I say it?  It's not the same delightfully greasy spongey crust!"}
{"text":"Seriously the worst service I have ever got in my life . We called in to order a pizza and the kid on the phone couldn't even figure out how to take my order then I told them 3 different times we had cash and to please bring change for it . You think they brought change ? Nope they tried to give us change back as if we were tipping the kid 20$ for the delivery . 3 timesssss I told them .  Horrible cold pizza too I will never eat with Pizza Hut ever again . Ever!!!"}
{"text":"Ever seen pizza like the commercials on Tv?! Haha. This pizza not only looked amazing but also tasted amazing! Shout outs to the older gentleman in the back putting on fire pies right now! I am impressed. This is the first time in a long time I've had Pizza Hut and it hit the spot for sure. If you live in the area you know there's not much cheap good carry out pizza. Here it is! Enjoy."}
{"text":"I'm a regular there , but this time I ordered was so bad I don't know where to start , but the worst part was the service from the manager jasmine she was so rude and disrespectful I have never meet anything like that!!"}
{"text":"As some people stated in the reviews the estimated time is too much bc they came in 25 mins. The pizza taste like ol' people had sex on top of it. Funny and disgusting, blah! Never ordering from this location, try the one more southern on 19th and Indian, much better."}
{"text":"Ordered for pick up while in the area, fast and friendly couldn't ask for more out of a small pizza hut such as this."}
{"text":"If I can give this location zero stars I would how in the hell do you lose a damn order? This has to be the most incompetent location!!!! Very unprofessional and tacky!!! Never again!!!!"}
{"text":"Avoid.  Portion size is an absolute joke.  Expect 1/2 of your sides and to be calling back asking who ate them on the way to your house."}
{"text":"I am upgrading my views on Pizza Hut because they now have a healthy menu!!  Sweet!  I had the \"skinny luau\" and it was very good.  I hope you enjoy it as much as I did when you are searching for a lighter pizza."}
{"text":"Our pizza was good but the service not so much. They took a while getting us our order because there was some sort of mix up, I think our pizza went to someone else by accident, and we had to wait for them to make it again."}
{"text":"Absolutely, positively the worst pizza and wings[boneless] I have ever had. Besides the fact that they were both ice cold, the pizza was stale. I literally have had two day old pizza that tasted better then this.. I've ordered from pizza hut many many times.. First time from this location.. And definitely the last. If you have the option, I highly recommend using a different location...."}
{"text":"Who owns this place?  Worst pizza, service, and closes 30 mins early. 

Avoid at all costs."}
{"text":"Ok, let's get down to work here.  We went for Taco Bell. Spoiler: we weren't disappointed. We split a fries supreme (4.5/5) and a doctor pepper (5/5) and. Oth got beef burrito supremes (1.5/5 \"you don't really know what you're eating. It's just mass produced meat spread\"-Alicia) and (2.5/5 me). Well I guess some of us were disappointed with the burrito. It was $2.99 though. The whole meal was $12. The fries were the star."}
{"text":"This location, right on the southwest corner of Scottsdale and Shea, gets pretty busy. But no matter how slammed the employees get, they're always super nice. 

I order pizzas from here several times a month for my staff -- I work nearby. I'm that person who scopes out my pizzas online and then calls them in. Always ask for coupons. Usually you'll get a better deal by calling in and asking, rather than by placing the order online. 

Oh and try the new Andrea's buffalo chicken pizza on the hand-tossed pretzel crust! It's awesome! It has pineapple on it, which sounds weird, but it totally works!"}
{"text":"No stars if I could. I called this location and I was immediately hung up on. I figured someone must have dropped the phone, right? Wrong, I called back they put me on hold then answered the phone didn't say a word and hung up. So I'd like to say pizza Hut....Suck it"}
{"text":"How can this place stay in business?! Rude employees and mgmt. took over an hour to make a medium pizza, and get this the delivery driver was taking the pizza out of the oven to deliver?! Oooook!!!!
Explains why there are \"no cars\" in the parking lot! 
I'm done!"}
{"text":"So i ordered earlier for lunch waymen called me and said there was an issue with my card. I had given the wrong card number so i gave my new card number and all was fine  . i ordered the pizza knots pizza. Lest just say i was less than thrilled the pizza was not that hot soaked in grease and the crust right under the knots was still dough. I literally rolled up a little dough ball with it. The knots were ok tho. Fast forward kids wanted pizza for dinner but the knots were out of stock. I ordered 2 med pizzas. No1 ever called or showed up i called and after being on hold for 10 mins ELI finally answered and said my card declined and he tried to call me. So while on the line i check my bal and there is more than enough money on there, he claims he called and i didnt answer so i asked if he left a msg bc i did not receive not one call and of course he said no. His attitude was so fucking nasty and condescending that i asked for the manager and of course in a tauting manner he says he is the manager right now.... Long story short i got the number to the corporate franchise office from him and i will be calling tomorrow. I could have ordered the pizza again but he pissed me off with his attitde so bad that i three clothes on and went and got dinner elsewhere and as bad as i didnt want to leave hence the reason i ordered this in the first place i refused to spend another dime there"}
{"text":"I ordered a Philly cheese pizza extra cheese extra steak and I got something that looked like it was frozen for the 37 dollars I spent I will for sure not be going back to this location the man who gave me the pizza got rude and tried to defend the fact that the pizza had barely any toppings on it ........take  my advice and go to one of the other pizza places in the area"}
{"text":"Worse Pizza Hut ever. Ordered the dinner box- extra pepperoni (which i paid extra for). Came with cinnamon sticks, breadsticks, and the pizza of course. I also ordered four sodas (two Mountain Dew and two root beers). When delivered to my house there were four mountain dews. No big deal- they claimed to be out of root beer. When we went to eat, there was literally two pepperonis on each pizza, no icing for the cinnamon sticks and the pizza was cold. When i called to complain the 'manager' claimed that he made the pizza himself and \"maybe the pepperoni fell off while being made\" and that they were out of icing, as well as root beer. I then asked why they didn't call, he claimed he did on his personal cell phone 10 times. Which I'm sure many do not answer phone calls they don't recognize. Though i did look at the number for Pizza Hut to compare- again i didn't answer since it wasn't similar. Finally, he offered to credit my account three dollars- which was a slap in the face and i rejected- didn't offer anything else. I will not be going here anymore, but then again can't expect anything more than Pizza Hut clearly."}
{"text":"This is one of the worst pizzas I've ever had. Super thick under cookef dough, barely any toppings. Ridiculous to even call this pizza!! Never ordering from here again."}
{"text":"Rude ass workers. Guy making pizza in back was rude, stated \"these people are an inconvenience\" to us, the only customer. We ordered carry out, came to picke up on scheduled time, was asked to wait a little, which we had no problem until \"chef\" was rude.  Rude ass motherfuckers! Never again. Don't even deserve a stupid star"}
{"text":"The pizza was still doughy, when pulling a piece it would fall apart. The place was busy and their was only one girl up front taking orders on phone so you have to wait to order. I wouldn't want to come back to this location."}
{"text":"Pizza came warm not even hot steam from opening the box nothing. Crust was not seasoned. Ordered before 9. Came almost close to midnight. Smh. Considering it holiday weekend was told 1 hour  for delivery. but before midnight.. #no. pick up better then delivery."}
{"text":"I give this place five stars because there really isn't much more to expect. It's a carry-out/delivery establishment. No dine-in. It's been clean every time I've been here. The workers are polite and prompt. They even open the boxes and show you your pizza before you leave. It's Pizza Hut quality pizza. I like this location."}
{"text":"Don't count on them (especially the manager, Wes) to swap a $2 in quarters for 2 $1 bills to deposit into the neighboring bank's ATM. 

The manager has seen me several times picking up pizza from this location, yet, treated me like a total stranger when I came in requesting this simple exchange at 6 in the evening today, simply stating \"I can only open the register with a sale\". 
I literally made a purchase earlier today too, so honestly, I felt extremely insulted by his fabrication. 
You're a manager- you can definitely open up the register- You just don't care about my business. 
I will take my business to the neighbouring Pizza Hut franchise- they will appreciate me more. 

I will admit though that this location does have fast service, is open late, and seldom makes mistakes (I would say that 10% of my orders have an incorrect amount of toppings, temperature, or the wings barely have any sauce)."}
{"text":"This place should be shut down... They leave you on hold for ever! The people that answer the phones are rude af .. They employees look nasty and dirty.. I will eat a cheese toast and pretend its pizza before I ever think of this place .."}
{"text":"They sent me two raw pizzas and Scott there manager could care less."}
{"text":"Picturesque pizzas almost 90% of the time! Trust me, Being a single mom of 4 Kids I can say I order pizza fairly frequently and this Pizza Hut gets it both the look and the taste right consistently more than any other I've lived by or ordered from. Wait time is never that long and the employees are always friendly."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery last night and the driver showed up without my breadsticks, the wrong soda and marinara \"sauce\" that was the consistency of water. He handed me a 2 liter of Pepsi when I ordered Diet and the ticket even said Diet. I asked if he had Diet in the car and he said \"no\". I then noticed my order of breadsticks was missing, which I paid for and asked if he was going to bring me my correct order back. He again said no and that he had noticed they were missing, but the people at the restaurant told him to just take the order. What?! He then proceeded to tell me \"if you have a problem call the store\" in a very rude tone.

Well I called, was on hold for 10 minutes and then someone picked up and when I said hello they hung up. I know someone was there because I could hear them breathing and background noise. I called back and same 10 minute hold with being hung up on again!!! I called a third time and this time after 11 minute hold I was able to speak with the assistant manager who was even more rude than the delivery driver. He had all sorts of excuses that they were busy and that's why it took me a half hour of holding on the phone. He didn't apologize for my hold time OR for my missing and incorrect food. I told him I just want a refund for my missing items because I don't want to wait another 45 minutes to eat breadsticks with marinara that is water. He told me he couldn't process any refund because I used a card. WHAT? He had all sorts of excuses about the system they use and how he doesn't know how to do it. I explained to him that he should ask someone else in the corporation to help him and as the consumer who did not get what they were charged for I am entitled to a refund. He offered me store credit, but there's no way I'm ordering from them again so this is not acceptable. He finally said he would leave a note for the store manager to call me tomorrow.

Well it's almost 8pm and the manager did not call me. I called many times throughout the day during business hours and no one answered the phone once. This location with horrible customer service has made it so I will never order from another Pizza Hut again."}
{"text":"This place sucks!! I placed an online order at 5:15 and it arrived @6:45 the pizza was so cold looks like it was pizza from the night before. I called and spoke with a supervisor and all she offered was to remake the pizza and it would take 3 more hours to get it or a credit to use within 30 days. If your service sucks why would I want a credit!? To top it off the driver was an idiot he parked and took 2 parking spots and and didn't even have a Pizza Hut logo on his car."}
{"text":"I ordered at 10:50am it's now 12:45 and they haven't delivered my food yet I called and the manager was so rude she wouldn't even give her name when she answered she said this is the manager what can I do for you. She said they had the wrong address, but on my email receipt it has my address. Um? Obviously something is wrong there.. she said they could redeliver the food. Why would I want food that's now cold and sitting there for 2 hours? I was really wishing the previous reviews would of been wrong, I wanted to try for myself cuz sometimes things Are different. But in this case Nope! Horrible customer service."}
{"text":"I ordered a pizza tonight and the picture below is how it was delivered.  It looks as though it was eaten and all the cheese is missing.  I call them and offered to send the Manager a picture she told me she was not comfortable with me having her personal cell phone.  But she offered me a credit for my next pizza.  I have always gone to Pizza Hut as my go to pizza because it is always good.  Not this time.  Very disappointed"}
{"text":"My order got here earlier than expected but the toppings, cheese and sauce is all over the box. Now the crust is soggy. I hate being that person but now I have to call for a new pizza."}
{"text":"It had been awhile (~1 year) since I've ordered Pizza Hut so I decided to give it a shot again. I didn't even get to the pizza part because so much had changed and everything that made the pizza delicious and unique was gone. I was a huge fan of the drizzle, especially the balsamic one, and all of them were off menu. Some of the older toppings they used to have are also completely gone. Not to mention the website looks bland and completely unappealing. I don't what happened to Pizza Hut but they went from being so interactive with the menu and up to speed with young people (they used to do pizzas for YouTube celebrities that were always creative and good). Now Pizza Hut looks like the most basic, generic run-of-the-mill pizza chain and it really can't compete with Jet's."}
{"text":"Whoever worked the phones on feb 28 in the at 10pm needs to be fired. She was beyond rude, lied to me, then basically hung up on me. I called to find out when the pizza should arrive, she said it should be pulling up at any moment... 45 minutes later I called and she said the same thing, I then asked if that means my pizza has been out of the oven for over 45min and she just kept saying \"I told you it left and should be arriving soon.\"   

Oh ya! When the pizza finally arrived, it was almost doughy it was so undercooked! It's incredible to me that a place can have so many complaints and Pizza Hut still allows them them to operate and give their brand a horrible name! If I ever order Pizza Hut again, it will 100% only be if they are the absolute only option!"}
{"text":"I used to order from here every Monday but after many bad experiences I have changed my pizza destination.  The service was okay if I picked up the pizza.  They usually got my order right and the pizza was fresh most of the time.  

The majority of my bad experiences with this Pizza Hut location come from the delivery driver.  When I order, I usually order for a specific time because this is when my boyfriend gets home from work and when we are ready to  eat dinner.  The delivery was often 20-30 minutes early, which made it so my boyfriend had to eat cold pizza.  The delivery driver also forgot my \"extra items\" on several occasions and he would just shrug and say it wasn't his fault.  The first couple times it happened I just let it go because it was an extra dipping sauce or something like that.  I actually worked for a different Pizza Hut location as a delivery driver and I know that it is the drivers responsibility to package up the \"extras\" like pop, salads and dips so I know it was him who forgot the missing items.

So let me tell you about the last time I ever ordered from this Pizza Hut and why it was the last time.  I ordered a pizza, as usual, and ordered an extra dipping sauce (cost $1.00).  The driver arrived 30 minutes early, which was annoying because my boyfriend wasn't home but I could let that go.  I gave the driver a $20.00 bill and checked for the extra sauce.  The sauce was not there so I asked about it and he just shrugged.  I explained that this wasn't the first time that my order wasn't correct and that I wanted the cost of the sauce removed from my bill.  He said he wasn't able to do that and then explained that he didn't have enough change to change my $20 and that I would need to use my credit card to buy the pizza.  I told him that it was his responsibility to have enough change on him to change bills and that I was not going to use my credit card.  He argued with me and said that I was being rude.  I told him to call his store and ask about the sauce and about what he was supposed to do about not having any change.  He said I had to call the store because it was my problem.  After arguing with him for a few minutes he called the store.  I talked to a representative at the store and they just argued with me more but eventually offered me 50% off.  I told them I would take the 50% off but that the driver didn't have any change to give me.  They then told me that the driver would return to the store (a 10 minute drive) with the pizza and then return to my home with change and my sauce but not a new pizza so I would be getting an old, cold pizza.  I disagreed with getting the same pizza since it will be cold and old and then without warning they put me one hold.  While I was on hold the driver saw children, about 12 years old, playing nearby and he told me to go feed my children and that I shouldn't worry about the price when my kids are hungry.  Just to be clear, I'm 24 years old and I don't look a day older than that.  Anyway, another representative from  the store comes on the line and makes me explain the entire situation again, which is very annoying.  While I'm explaining everything to the person on the phone, the driver goes to his car, gets a cigar and starts smoking it right next to me.  The person on the phone gets frustrated and gives me my pizza for free (which wasn't what I was asking for) and tells the driver to return to the store.  The driver starts walking back to his car WITH my money in his hand so I called after him and he very reluctantly returns and gives me the money back but then asks for a tip.  I just look at him completely dumbfounded then I turn and walk away. As I'm walking away, the driver calls me a rude b*tch.

So that was my horrible experience with the Pizza Hut on Bannister Road.  Now because there is the possibility of them reading this I have written some points below on how they can improve their service.

1. The customer is always right (I'm a very understanding person, especially when it comes to customer service because I've worked in it for so long but the customer service at this location is horrible)
2.  Hire better staff (if not even 1/3 of your staff members know how to deal with a dissatisfied customer then there is clearly an issue)
3.  Better training (your delivery driver should know what change to carry and should know how to package \"extras\")
4. The customer is always right (I can't stress this enough.  DON'T argue with your customers unless there is a very good reason.  If you've made a mistake, own up to it and try to make it right.  It's not the customer's job to fix your mistake)"}
{"text":"This was our first visit to this location and let me teellll you what happened. We ordered online and decided to pick up since they have a drive thru pick up, plus it saves on delivery fee. (We live right up the street) and had to go to another store so it was convenient to not have to get out of the car. Howeeevvveeerrrr, we pulled up said hi to the girl at the window. She just stared like we were two aliens. Awkwaaaard! Anyways, my gf gives the name on the order and the girl says nothing ... just turned around and walked away. She comes back rather quickly (luckily) and shoved the box out the window. My gf mistakenly began to hand her the customer receipt copy and laughs and makes small talk about her silly accident. The girl literally straight faced says nothing then closed the window! We were like woooow. She must really hate her job. More than likely we will give it one more go around in case it was an off night and see what happens. I will let you know when that happens but honestly in no rush at this point. As for the pizza, it was ok and the onions and peppers where HUGE like someone didn't feel like chopping them up. We ended up taking most of them off because they overpowered the pizza taste."}
{"text":"My family and I live about two minutes away from this location we frequent this location often walk into order and carry out within minutes the pizza is always done to perfection have been a lifelong customer Pizza Hut has to be one of the best pizzas around"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I are thoroughly angry. We ordered some food to get delivered, and asked that the delivery person call when they arrive (we can't hear the doorbell), and we were told this was fine.Two hours passed, and it said the order was still being \"made\". I had my boyfriend call to check on the order and they said they cancelled it because we never answered the door. We never got a phone call our food had arrived, nor a call when they cancelled our order. They said we couldn't come pick it up and that we could only be refunded. This will be the last time I order from here until I move."}
{"text":"Been going here for many years. They make mistakes sometimes but they will correct it for free if it's legit. I have not had many issues with this place."}
{"text":"just moved into the area, second time using pizza hut, both times pizza was 15-20  late and luke warm.i find that it doesn't matter when i order be it day or night. (lesson learned)"}
{"text":"Honestly ... I have not been satisfied with this Pizza Hut. For 3 times in a roll.. I have been so unhappy. I don't think I will be ordering from this Pizza Hut any more. 

Today I ordered a customized pan size pizza, wings, & fries. When I opened the box of the pizza it was so messy and it looked so unappetizing. I felt like the sauce was just too much. I don't understand how you can serve someone that. The wings were okay. But the Cajun cries I ordered.. For $2 there not a lot .. The quantity for was very disappointing too. 

This isn't the first time that I've been unhappy with this location. Other times they forgot my topping! Keep it mind of course I did pay extra for my toppings. And another time the pizza was extremely salty ... 


At this point I rather choose Dominos."}
{"text":"The pan pizza itself, a product Pizza Hut has perfected, is quite good.

My complaint is the awful smell in this location, which looks like it's seen better days. Kinda lost my appetite waiting for my to-go order. Nasty."}
{"text":"Called in my order like I usually do ..... really rude new employees. Miss Darrell and Aruthr. Needs new management. Place used to be my go to for years."}
{"text":"Pizza is always good!

They were really understaffed, but still friendly under the pressure and worked as fast as they could when I ordered inside.

AND when I've ordered online or called in for delivery, the delivery drivers have always been ridiculously nice whether it's to me or family or friends - even out animals."}
{"text":"Ordered wings online. Show up and pay - they say 5 mins.  About 1/2 hour AFTER I ordered they inform me fryers were broken.  How did they not know this 30 mins ago? How about 10 mins ago (20 mins after ordering)???  To make thing worse Nestor the \"manager\" - is all smiles and laughing about it.  They failed on every level between the condescending attitude to the just absolute failure to deliver their own product. To completely fail a customer and then to laugh in their face about it...I just can't believe what I just experienced."}
{"text":"- went to order my son a personal pan , ! Sat and watched the lady armisha ( worker ) take the cheese out the table and whip it in my sons box & tried to go serve it to me that is absolutely GROSS .."}
{"text":"Fast and good delivery, the order was correct and still hot. The only thing was the ordering process, online didnt work right and over the phone you had to wait some time to get through."}
{"text":"I waited an an hour and a half for a pizza that was still raw. The cheese in the middle wasn't even melted. It was a pepperoni and pineapple pizza and I could count the 7 pepperoni slices hidden in all that pineapple and cold cheese. Never again."}
{"text":"No Lie I Have Been To Every Pizza Hut In Phoenix And Surrounding Cities And All In San Diego I've Never Had An Issue With The Food! I Love Pizza Grew Up Eating It And Will Never Stop Eating It. I Love The They Have The Multi-Grain Crust; The Big Bites, Small Price Menu; And OMG The Edge I Remember Back In The Day When They Had It By My Favorite Pizza! Everyone Need To Try The Edge If You Haven't Yet I Promise It Will Become Your Favorite Pizza; Eat-it So It Won't Go Away Again!  And We All Know Pizza Is Good For Every Meal. And I Agree With Perry The Pastas Are Awesome I've Had All Of Them!"}
{"text":"This was one of the worst Pizza Hut Pizza's I've ever had. It was \"treat night\" and we were very excited to have Pizza Hut pizza as we love their crust. As you can see in the pictures there are a lot of bare spots on the pizza with little to no toppings. There was hardly any sauce - you can see how dry it looks. When I was picking up the pizza - the guy at the store said it's just the way it is. He argued with me in front of the other customer as if I was making this up. I complained to customer and they offered me a $10 credit for my next order - which doesn't even cover the cost of this pizza. Very disappointing!!!"}
{"text":"This is the third time I order here and has been twice that I have the best service kind people and this time Gio help me a lot thank you guys keep it going 
Don't listen to haters"}
{"text":"We have ordered from this franchise location for years. We got a confirmation email from an online order. Never got an email saying there was a problem. We waited and waited with no delivery. They had the wrong phone number. If I order online I guess I expect an email that there's a problem. We have literally spent a thousand bucks at this place and they can't sort my order out? We're done."}
{"text":"We ordered from this location twice and both times it took them over two hours and when told our money would be refunded to our card it never was. So we had to call them to deal with that a week later. Mind you we live right behind the place so two hours is insane."}
{"text":"I ordered two med sized pizza five minutes before closing was told it would be delivered, but it would be about an hour and a half. Well it's now over an hour and a half and it looks like I'm not gonna get my food and out 18.00.. So I'll never order from them again!!!!!"}
{"text":"I guess they think throwing spinach on top without cooking it with the pizza is acceptable."}
{"text":"Countless times I have ordered here ( Lake Wylie SC) to have an order come VERY  late (2 hours plus), incorrect or not able to find my home. I even went up to the location one time to be told by the then manager that I hadnt paid for the order and my card was declined for the reason they no-showed. Then I showed him the pending charge on my visa card ( which I should never have to show  them my account) to have him tell me I still had to pay for it.  Dominos is a mile further from my home, and I have twice now played the Race Game. Who ever gets me my food first wins.... Dominos everytime. 
I have also spoke countless times with Tabatha the District manager. Nothing gets fixed and service is still horrible.  Dont take my word for it. Order twice and see what happens .. Good Luck"}
{"text":"The pizza is usually good at this location, but the service is very good. The delivery service is usually pretty good and they always remember my cheese and peppers. What can you say about Pizza Hut? It's pizza. But the service, it's not pizza, sometimes it's just a crust."}
{"text":"My family has been coming to this same Pizza Hut for at least 8 years now. Never have we had a problem with the service until tonight. When I tried to call to place my order I was on hold for 5 minutes 3 separate times. Then when they finally decided to answer the phone. It was like a child was taking my order absolute complete silence. Then when I go to pick up my order they are 6 employees standing around not doing anything while the phones are ringing off the hook! Not even was the service horrible but they still managed to mess up my order. This is the last time I will be spending any money at this Pizza Hut"}
{"text":"This Pizza Hut locations lacks standards. Almost every time I come in here, I have to have them remake my pizza. Today, my wife and I came and ordered stuffed crust pizza whole pizza pineapple with half black olives and half jalapeños. The pizza came out with 3-4 slices with very little cheese and the other slices with about 40-60% of the slices with the correct amount of cheese. They remade it right away. The new pizza almost had cheese covering the slices but needed some more. It was nice to see the delivery driver care and come over to help. They were nice about it but since this is an ongoing issue, maybe some training needs to be completed at this location and maybe new management ."}
{"text":"Company is too big and commercial its all about the bottom line. If you dont like the managment at this location wait a week they are always changing."}
{"text":"Not impressed at all. We ordered breadsticks as an appetizer, they didn't arrive until just a minute or two before the food arrived and the salad was gross-looking. And the table was sticky and the server never gave us silverware, I had to go take it off other tables. There are better places to go in the area."}
{"text":"In a world where money buys you food--why would you come here and buy cardboard?  

Pizza Hut in general has gone downhill so far, it's not even funny.  I remember when I was a kid in the early 80's, Pizza Hut was awesome.  Now, it's all horrible."}
{"text":"Pizza is great but u have to call. The reason for the crappy review is that we are so frustrated with the app that never works and always freezes that it's driven us to anyone else with a working app. No matter new phone restarts or app refreshes and updates there's no fix and we've tried on multiple devices to the point that we waste a half hour before we just choose another app which works with another pizza maker."}
{"text":"This place is not even worth a half a star they do not tell you when u order wings that it cost to have half n half there is a charge for the ranch dip also our food was late due to cook messing up order no sweet tea rude server never again will we eat here no wonder the star rating is bad if I would of seen it before dining here we wouldn't have place smells bad too  would give no star but won't let me THIS PLACE SUCKS"}
{"text":"I ordered delivery and as soon as it came and I grabbed a slice of pizza I noticed an inch of dark hair in my pizza. I don't have dark hair. And when I called, I even said I don't care I'm still going to eat my pizza just not that slice, but I wanted to call to let them know, the lady responds with \"that's funny no one in the kitchen has black hair, but I'll let them know\" ok.. I don't either. The 2 stars if for the delivery driver only."}
{"text":"Great store, great staff, great food! All the employees have been here for a while and I like that when I go in they recognize me and are always friendly. The food is always well prepared here and since you can order ahead you can plan ahead."}
{"text":"This local Pizza Hut is a good place to stop by to pick up a pizza and some wings for dinner.  The cheese and pepperoni pizzas with garlic parmesan wings usually hit the spot.  The staff are always attentive and on the move - making pizzas and preparing orders for delivery.  As a reminder for myself and a tip for others, check Yelp and call the store to order ahead.  That way, your order is ready when you arrive and you won't have to wait.  This location is quite busy with deliveries so orders placed in-store will require that you wait for the pizza and wings to be prepared."}
{"text":"Go here a lot because it's close to my house. Never had an issue before,  the pizza is usually always good as are the wings. Until I ordered a pizza for delivery for the Mayweather vs Paquio fight ,the driver decided to add a $5 tip to my card after I already tipped her cash. I saw it on my bank statement called the manager who said she was aware of that problem with this driver and assured me they would credit my account but never did. After talking to 3 different managers it never got taken care of. I suggest you pay with cash if you go here at all. Go to Mario's in El Mirage it's worth the trip on NE corner of Dysart and Waddell for real NY style pizza."}
{"text":"As far as delivery Pizza goes, this is a good choice.  They have always be on time, and the pizza arrives hot and as ordered.  I have also gone into their location for carry-out, and have had good experiences every time.

Pizza Hut has really changed their menu with a lot of new options like the boneless Teriyaki chicken wings, and a wide variety of pizza options.  It's not your Father's Pizza Hut any more.  If you have not been in a while, check it out."}
{"text":"So I preordered pizza today before class.. I got a call when they were here. but because I've been getting spam calls lately, I answered \"yo who dis?\" when the two guys (Richard and cole I believe were their names..) answered, they were like \"dis be pizza hut. we got your pizza.\" I was amazed at how cool these guys were about it and I felt so bad. Thank you pizza hut for making my day so much better. The food they brought also tastes fucking amazing."}
{"text":"This is definitely the last time I use this Pizza Hut I think their food is very good but their way of doing business at this particular location is extremely poor. When they get busy they simply stop answering the phone There's no way to inquire where your order is. Never again. Several hours later some guy calls and says they had an emergency and will have to shut  down for the night. I ordered a pizza from Barro's which is across the street and since I was going to be so close, I thought I would check out what happened just to be nosy. Maybe they were held up right? Poor workers. Wrong. It was made up. That;s how their management handles tough situations."}
{"text":"Crappy service per usual... wouldn't accept cash. Tried to pay a $25 Bill with a $50, and they wouldn't accept it. Do yourself a favor go to Pizza Pit or some other place while in Oregon"}
{"text":"Wow! So many negative reviews!  I don't eat pizza that often, but I had my cousin in town and we decided to order their new bacon cheese stuffed crust pizza, cheese sticks, and a 2 liter soda.  With delivery, the cost came to just over $30.  A little pricy for my taste.  

I used the Pizza Hut app to make the order at about 5:30pm and it estimated the delivery time at about 6:50pm.  Our pizza arrived around 6:25-6:30 pm and I was just thrilled at how fast it came!  It was at my door nearly 30 min early.  

The pizza was hot, fresh, and simply delicious.  

The best part, I got an email the next day.  Pizza Hut sent an apology email for arriving too soon!(what??) And they gave me a coupon for a free large pizza on my next order.  So, yes. I will order my next pizza here."}
{"text":"The pizza was cooked perfectly so the pan pizza I ordered was crispy and buttery.  I ordered the spicy garlic wings for the first time and I really liked them - they had a nice tang to them but not a lot of spice if that's what you like. The delivery was really fast and the delivery guy was friendly and polite.  Nice Pizza Hut experience!"}
{"text":"Ordered today for lunch for delivery to my workplace. My boss treated us to lunch since it was my birthday.  Ordered online and delivery was 6 minutes later than they said it would be but all the food was correct and delicious!  I got a large supreme pizza, lots of wings, and a cookie for under $50 bucks and it fed the whole office.  Delivery dude was nice."}
{"text":"Had pizza delivered Sunday 7-19-15 around 7 pm.  This location is on Pecos and Desert Inn, right behind the McDonalds.  It's just a delivery/pickup place and there are no tables inside.  

I ordered online and just for shiggles I asked for them to write a joke on the box, which they did, but it was \"Why did the chicken cross the road?\"  And there was no answer on the box.  So I guess I'll never know.  :( But kudos to them for trying to be a good sport. 

The pizza was on time and it was pretty much correct.  We got a large pan pizza, 8 wings, and an order of breadsticks for $26.45.  Minus one star because they didn't bring the marinara sauce for the breadsticks and the delivery lady was kinda borderline rude...well more like abrupt.  As soon as I opened the door she barked \"CARD AND ID\".  It threw me off and I was like, huh? Because I paid online she asked to see the card I paid with and my ID. 

I really like their new wing containers...it's like a little black plastic ball.  So when you eat your wings you can throw the bones in the lid.  Genius."}
{"text":"If I could rate it zero stars, I would. Waited an hour and a half, the driver calls to say that he can't get to my apartment. I explain that there are two other entrances and he can go around, and he says he'll call me right back. He never called me back and my food never arrived. I called the store and the manager said my order had been cancelled and that there was nothing she could do for me now or in the future."}
{"text":"Important to note that this location does not have a sit down area. Make sure to check for online deals. The staff was nice and my order was ready on time. They gave us an extra marinara sauce for the breadsticks for free. Stuffed crust and toppings were plentiful. Good hut!"}
{"text":"Pizza looked great. Not enough pepperoni though.  For a large two topping,  with thin pepperoni.  Boneless chicken was sub-par, dry not something I'd get again.  I like your sauce and cheese.  It's a classic taste.  Wait staff was nice.  Promise pick up time was on point."}
{"text":"I can order online or pickup with the time i requested. On point Always &  can't Beat the Dinner Box."}
{"text":"Two stars for the naked chicken wings because those were good. I thought i'd try something new by ordering the Skinny Up pizza this time. The description did say that it would be less...smaller portions. I had no idea it would be so minimalistic! It barely had anything on it. On top of that it was scorched! Thinnest pizza ever. Like cardboard. Super dissapointing. Never ordering this pizza ever again."}
{"text":"Good Pizza Hut... Very fast and very nice people here! The put the topping on well here too! I like the wings as well and you gotta have those chocolate chip cookie pies!!! AMAZING!!! Good Pizza Hut here"}
{"text":"Placed an order for pick-up at 6:45PM on Feb. 25. Order was on time and ready when we got there. I swear, this Pizza Hut branch has the best employees and manager in town! We had a question about one of their products, and the manager was very helpful and informative. We are very happy not only with the food, but also with their customer service. This is now our favorite Pizza Hut location. Shoutout to the crew!"}
{"text":"Sooooo I order my food in the app at 6:01.I then get an eta for 7:05, fine. At 7:15 because they're up the street from me, I call to get a better ETA. The guy on the phone is rude as ever. So of course 10 minutes later I get a knock at my door. My wing box is crushed ans my pizza is cold. I call back to let them know. The same rude guy tells me I didn't receive cold pizza. I'm like ok, are you serious, he goes yeah, did you use a thermometer? I'm like ooook are you serious? He goes yeah it's a valid question don't you think? I'm lime you're f#&#ing kidding me right??? I ask if he's the manager, he says yes, at this point I'm livid. Then he offers a refund, then Raphael gets on the phone saying he's a manager with the most nonchalant attitude, defending his employee. He then proceeds to say he's low staffed and that's why I received cold food. Then wants to give me an in-store credit????? How about NO, I never wanted to see Monday so quick so I can call corporate."}
{"text":"This Pizza Hut is horribly managed. I am really not sure why someone hasn't stepped in and revamped the whole place. I don't think I have ever ordered without having issues...we usually wait months between ordering before thinking we will give it another try.   On my last visit I left work thinking my husband called in the order. When I arrived, my order wasn't in. Called my husband and he informed me he was still on hold after calling 10 minutes prior. Not hard to believe as I counted more than a dozen calls that came in while I waited that no one bothered answering. I could of course hear the employees cursing and arguing in the back.  Sad that none of this surprises me....most of the time we drive to Target and purchase their Pizza Hut pizzas."}
{"text":"Ordered over the phone and it took so long (over an hr.) to finally receive my order. I've ordered more from this location before and it took at least 30 minutes. And to add on, i told the worker what I've wanted and told him to repeat the order yet he mistaken an item on the receipt. I was not satisfied with what I've ordered but I still gave a tip for gratuity."}
{"text":"Been here many times, pizzas are great, but it's always the same crap with water cups, they're almost always out of water cups, or so they claim, so they want to charge you for regular cups even though you tell them you're only gonna drink water, they won't even give you small cups for water, they want to charge you for it anyway. It's their fault if they never have water cups and they will never go out of their way to satisfy the customers, as if it would be the end of the world to give customers small soda cups to drink water since they never have water cups, so I always make it to go instead."}
{"text":"I order pizza hut all the time. At one time or another i have ordered from most of the pizza huts in NE Ohio. I have never had a BAD pizza from anywhere except the mentor location near where i live. I wrote the first one off but the last couple i have gotten have been awful. I will not be ordering from this location again for a couple years or until they get better management or staff whichever the problem may be. Just wish they were as good as the other locations i will continue to order from."}
{"text":"To start with if you can get what you order the pizza is fair. But the staff ( cooks ) are far from adequate. We ordered pizzas and got home to a hungry family only to find the wrong pizza.
Immediately called to complain about the wrong order and was asked if we wanted to travel back to get and another pizza but would not deliver one.
We said no and then they offered to give us a credit and put it on our phone number.
We agreed and that was the end of the problem (solved).
BUT wait we went to the store several days later to order another pizza and use our credit and was told we didn't have one under any of our phone numbers. Finally after requesting the manager she did give us the credit, ordered the pizzas and they came out missing the olives!!!! Instead of waiting for the one pizza to be remade and the other one getting cold they put olives in a cup and sent us on our way. 
Pizza Hut you have lost a customer!!!!!"}
{"text":"I've been very pleased with this Pizza Hut!  They always deliver within 30 minutes.  The food is always exactly what I order.  They always deliver everything while it's still hot too.  Without a coupon, it can be pretty expensive, but if you find a great deal, it's filling, great food!  I love the Stuffed Crust pizza and the Pan pizza.  I also can't order anything without breadsticks.  Once, on a very busy night during Catholic Lent season, they were so busy that they ran out of pizza dough.  They apologized and referred me to another Pizza Hut location in Gilbert, which I think is excellent customer service!  Never fails to please!"}
{"text":"Ordered my usual large stuffed crust pizza today and is always hot and fresh as normal. This location always gives me 50 percent off since I'm a loyal customer. Will always recommend this location to anyone,there wings are delicious and pasta is great too. Love getting my large stuffed crust 7 dollars every time out the door"}
{"text":"I promise that in my honest opinion this pizza hut is a horrible joke. Once, employess walked by my for 15 minutes before i approached someone and asked for service. Another time they said they cant serve me because they rant out of dough, on a subsequent visit they couldnt take customers because they ran out of cheese. My order here has gotta made incorrectly here a few times. I ordered pizza from here once and it took 3 hours to come. One day while at the pizza hut on sandalwood and kennedy area, the pizza hut lost electrical power and we couldnt see in the dark during eat so had to evacuate. Pizza huts in America are amazing! In Brampton Ontario Canada they are nightmares! I swear i think that everytime God has protected me from getting fat."}
{"text":"placed an online order which it was schedule to be deliver in 30 mts. an hour later i got a cold pizza..ewww!
will not recoment this location..if you live in the uncc area..dominos is a your best option!"}
{"text":"Speedy Delivery to our hotel. Awesome customer service with a friendly smile. Our 2 topping Medium pizzas were loaded with toppings on a perfectly crusted pizza. They even threw in cheese & red pepper packets along with paper plates and napkins and our 2 ltr was ice cold."}
{"text":"Two stars because at least they try to fix their mistakes. Pizza is good when it's good and wings are usually cooked very well. The box deal is a good deal if you're looking for a mix of foods. 
As for my experience wasn't great. They messed up one of the pizzas but they did fix the order and allowed us to take the messed up pizza home. This location does mess up a lot. At the end of our visit the cashier was out of pennies so she asked \"is it okay if I short you a penny\". I thought to myself she couldn't be serious."}
{"text":"Every time I've ordered from this Pizza Hut, they have received a call because they can't get an order right the first time. I always order online so there are no arguments or excuses on their end other than simply making it incorrectly. Tonight was no different. They do always give you a \"credit\" for screwing up your order and then send someone with the correct item. They did not give me cheese breadsticks when they charged extra for it so I called and let them know. They gave me a $10 credit then applied it towards new breadsticks, even though I already paid for and did not receive them. However, I waited an extra hour for cheese breadsticks tonight and they're over cooked with very little cheese plus THEY ARE COLD. Pretty disappointing for a pregnant woman who's wanted nothing but cheese breadsticks for two days. I decided to give them a chance after not ordering from them for a year and this is a perfect reminder of why I always choose Dominos. Y'all need to get it together or hire employees that know how to read tickets."}
{"text":"Got takeout from this location. Pizza was ready and hot. The toppings were very scarce (it was like only have the pizza got cheese on one of them). The deal we got was decent hence the 3 stars. The inside was dead and there was only one person I saw working at 1045. I may or may not come back to this location. They need to work on consistency of toppings."}
{"text":"I placed an order online shortly after 7:00 pm, the estimated delivery was 9:00 pm. I understand that the restaurant was obviously busy, however when I called the store at 9:50 pm I was told by an employee that no order had been placed. After speaking with the manager I was told that someone had called at 7:30 and canceled this order. This person was NOT myself. When I informed the manager that I had not canceled my order and was still very much expecting a delivery, he informed me that they could redo the order but would not be able to deliver the food for at least 1 hour. I completely understand that they were busy however they canceled the wrong order, didn't apologize, or even offer a discount. That is completely unacceptable."}
{"text":"I have ordered 2x and both times it has been online. on the 6th I ordered the food for delivery at 2:42pm and had a time of delivery for 5:15 pm. lets just say the food was late and when called I got a rude employee named Daniela telling me my ordered just got in and they had others that came in at the same time that my ordered was called in at 4:47 P.M that was inaccurate I had the confirmation email they sent me as well as the tracker still up on the computer but she still wanted to bicker with a customer. when the pizza got here at 5;57 p.m. the delivery driver had cuts on his hands taped off with painters tape and dry blood on his hands so I called in rite after that and got Daniella again and she gave me the whatever response by her tone on the phone I got a call back from Daniel the supervisor and he gave us a credit which we use as a portion for a future order.. at that time he promised a better experience but we didn't get that  when we ordered after that we had ordered at 7:52 P.M and confirmation was given for 8:55 p.m well lets just say after several calls and the run around the delivery driver jose arrives at 9:52 with our cold pizza the box was not even warm and some wings were the boxes look like they were dropped a few times - top completely smashed and I told him to check stopped him before he drove off and he apologized informing me he was suppose to be off at 9:30 p.m and when he went into the store the order was sitting on the counter and they told him it must go out he apologized for the 2+ wait as well as the cold pizza when I called Daniella had a giggle in her voice and I asked for the supervisor Daniel she said the supervisor will be in tomorrow . I believe that this is part of the issue they don't have someone there with authority as well as I believe if you want a good work team it has to come from some example of a good leader or good leadership. I filled out the survey and I have not gotten one response as well as not a call back from pizza hut or anything. I would not recommend this location to anyone if I got this poor service 2x in 3 weeks I cant to thing of what I got next. From poor delivery to poor quality of food and employees that need to be retrained or fired and start with someone that really wants to do a job they are paid to do. the thing is Daniella when I told her about the pizza she replied well as of write now all I can do is send you out another pizza but that's not gonna be anytime soon. Its gonna be a 2 1/2 hour wait I was like its already 10 p.m..  told her it was to late and my husband stuck the pizza in the over on warm to heat up. nothing else offered or no apology the delivery driver was even surprise by her response and was more sincere with his apology.
Thanks, Bonnie. Your order will be delivered on

{"text":"Just what you expect from Pizza Hut - no suck. Same pizza you had before. Makin' it great. Embrace the noid. Tell papa John to suck shit through fresh ingredients. It's like McDonalds, are you expecting a prize?"}
{"text":"This is the most poorly managed Pizza Hut I've ever ordered from. Twice (out of 3 times), my pizza has not been ready at the designated pick-up time. This most recent time, I was told 5 minutes past my pick-up time (while I was waiting inside) that the person who made my pizza forgot one of the toppings. So a new pizza had to be made, adding 10 minutes to my wait. There was no apology verbally offered, only the consolation that I'll be getting the WRONG pizza for free. I also waited for around two minutes to even be acknowledged, and I could hear an alert go off when the door is opened so that workers know a customer is inside. No apology was given for my wait on that either. 

Also, they suck at making pizza here. The pizzas look like a drunk person made them, but worse. At least a drunk person would be personally invested in making their own drunk pizza look and taste good.

I will go out of my way to never return to this lpcation again."}
{"text":"This location recently received a facelift.  It really needed a redo.  The dining area now has better lighting.  The decor is very pretty and modern. The buffet and salad bar is new.  You can tell it is clean now.  The same staff is  employed there and they give very attentive service.  The food is your standard Pizza Hut offerings.  You know what to expect and they meet your expectations.  I was happy to see this location updated.  I'm glad I gave them another chance!"}
{"text":"I always order from here.  This is a large, why is there more olives than pepperoni.. when I ordered extra!  Is this it?  Wow!"}
{"text":"Wish I could give this place zero stars. Ordered a pizza with the crushed tomato sauce on it and cheessticks and went to pick it up. Horrible customer service, nobody at the front. I had to call the front for the employees from the back to come assist me. When I got home my fiance and I noticed that not only was the food cold it had NO PIZZA SAUCE ON IT!!!! Yes that's right, a pizza with no sauce......and breadsticks instead of cheese sticks!!!"}
{"text":"If you are hungry but feel like staying in, Pizza Hut delivery is the best!

They regularly have new online delivery deals which makes it worth it even more! A pizza and a soda bottle and you're all set. I, for one, cannot have enough pizza and Pizza Hut does it the best. 

Just write in your address, choose one of the online deals, create your pizza and choose a payment method. They call you once to confirm the order, and within half an hour, Voila! your order is at the door!

Delicious pizza, great deals, cordial staff and great service: what more do you want? I give 5 stars!"}
{"text":"I have no idea why this location doesn't have 5 stars! 

I order delivery from here often they are always on time and always get my order exactly correct even with my milk allergies. 

The delivery is always under 30 minutes wait time and the delivery guy is always friendly. Pizza is hot and wings are \"burnin\". I definitely recommended this location. 

They rock. 
Now I want pizza!!!"}
{"text":"Let's call this what it is - a Pizza Hut...and by that standard, these guys rock it. I've been ordering delivery here for years because I have an addiction to their crust and breadsticks. The delivery is always on time and everything is delivered as expected.

If you're looking for a higher quality, more upscale pizza place, go back and keep searching. Don't eat in, get what you order, then complain on Yelp about getting what you paid for."}
{"text":"Pizza was ready on time and the toppings were correct. The pizza was just what you expect from Pizza Hut (not my favorite but the kids like it.) Ordered online; make sure you click on the specials when you order or you will not automatically get the lower price. With the special, the price was great. The kids running the location did a great job; there were tons of orders coming in and people coming for pick-up, but they got everyone taken care of in a good time."}
{"text":"Ordered a large pizza with Crushed Red Pepper Crust. Instead, I got my pizza with regular crust and crushed red pepper ALL OVER the pizza. I can tolerate this. The rest of my family ordered another meal from somewhere else. Follow directions or you lose customers. I doubt I'll be able to order from here again with how pissed off everyone was."}
{"text":"So glad to have a Pizza Hut in town again! The pizza is so good. We only order from there a few times within the year but every time the pizza is delicious and the staff are friendly. This place is just take out and delivery but I know other places have buffets during the week and they are so good! Full of salads, pizza and desserts! So good! Definitely one of my favourite pizza places!"}
{"text":"I didn't experience all the negative effects like everyone else on here. My pizza was just meh, nothing wrong but nothing great either. I heard a commercial for 2 topping pizzas at $5.99 each. I ordered a plain cheese pizza and was charged $12! Not sure how that balances out. Probably would not order again unless I ordered the promotional items as I feel ripped off for what I paid."}
{"text":"If you order from here and the internet says it will be ready in 15 minutes....add at least an hour to that. This is the second time I've been to this location and the second time they have been this slow.  Neither time has been a holiday or something like Super Bowl Sunday, just normal days. It's been 6 months or so since our last visit. I don't know that I will to try here again."}
{"text":"The pizza was great I really enjoyed every single bite of it even the next day the stuff crust was so delicious the staff was great it was late at night around 9 PM. Great guy helped me at the moment he even added extra pizza sauce since I stated last time I hardly got any sauce. Deff ordering from them again. They don't deliver my area but it was worth the drive"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I tried ordering some food just a bit ago. After 45 mins we call and they tell us they are closed and never received our order. We had a conformation code and everything. The \"manager\" couldn't even form a complete sentence when talking to us and used slang \"my boy said you had a code\" not very professional. 
He told us they could deliver us our order once they open the following day. I don't see how that helps considering we were hungry then. Not later. 

Will not be ordering again from here. This Pizza Hut has gone so down hill. It's very sad."}
{"text":"Makes Pizza Hut look real bad! Cheap on the toppings! Bad service! Never again! I would rather drive to another Pizza Hut. Very disappointing."}
{"text":"The food is really good. The service unfortunately, was not. We were seated and the waitress took way too long to come to the table with drinks. Mixed everything up, and didn't give us any straws. Then sped off and didn't come back to take our order at all. Finally we went up to the counter to place our order. She's got a bad attitude and is not very helpful. They need better help here!!"}
{"text":"HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE. This location needs to be re-staffed. Garbage employees obviously trained by they're \" manager \" ."}
{"text":"We are just in town for the night and my husband went and got our pizza to go.  He came back to the hotel and they had not given him our full order.  We were missing the cookie that my little kids were really looking forward to.  So, I tried to call, but apparently that is an impossibility. The call to the number listed goes to some corporate call center who then tried to forward me to the actual Pizza Hut, who after a long time on hold finally hung up on me.  So, while the cookie isn't a huge deal, the fact that there was no way to fix this problem was a pretty big deal to me."}
{"text":"Pizza is better than most.  Try the buffet for lunch.  It's a bargain."}
{"text":"This Pizza Hut is divine!!! My orders are ALWAYS correct, I like extra sprinkles on my breadsticks and theirs are just orgasmic!!!! My pan pizza is always cooked all the way through, and the pizza arrives piping hot. The staff are always friendly and the delivery people make sure I can get in the house safely. I recommend this Pizza Hut store without reservation!!!!"}
{"text":"Love the food but this branch is a mess. I ordered a big box which included pizza, breadsticks, and cinnamon sticks. That didn't meet the price requirement for delivery so I ordered a 2 oz soda to put me over the limit. I never got the soda and the pizza box was soaked in wing sauce. I didn't even order wings. It got all over my clothes and hands and I had to scrub the counters after setting the box down. It was handed to me like that! Couldn't believe it."}
{"text":"This is probably the worst Pizza Hut I have been to. I waited an hour before I called this location back to see where my delivery order was. Not only did they enter my address wrong, they called me a liar when I said I never received a call from their delivery driver.  The person I spoke with on the phone hung up on me when I asked to speak with their manager.  I went to the store to speak with their manager and she blew me off.  All in all I would not recommend this location."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery @ 8:51pm on a Sunday evening.. The order arrived within a reasonable amount of time, however it was the quality of food and service  that justifies the low rating.

1. My bill was $21, I handed the delivery driver two twenty dollar bills. To which he asked, \"do you need change\" umm yes I need change.. Nothing justified a  90% tip. Not to mention Pizza Hut charges for delivery anyhow..

2. Then when I do request change the driver isn't prepared to give me my exact change.. He had less than 15 dollars on himself. So this driver earned a $5 dollar tip plus the delivery charge, because he didn't have change not because I choose to be generous.

3. We ordered a large two topping panned pizza and an order of breadsticks with marinara sauce. The pizza was warm, the breadsticks and the marinara were a different story. The marinara was cold and tasted foul, most likely because it was stored at an improper temperature.. So we threw it out

Crazy that we spend $25 dollars on a pizza that wasn't even served properly to ensure my family eating was safe from food borne illness...

I would encourage a manager or district level supervisor to reach out to me!"}
{"text":"Terrible location! I've ordered 3 times now and they either did not have what I ordered or (this past time) did not deliver the pizza AT ALL. I will not reattempt ordering from here."}
{"text":"As much as we enjoy Pizza Hut, this location is just not the one to use.  I kinda wish we had another option for our area.

We placed our order @ 7:30 PM, the computer generated a 45 Minute wait time.  at 8:21 I called about our Pizza that still wasn't here.  The alleged manager Melissa said - rudely - that they were running behind and that we should never trust the internet system. I called back 5 Minutes later to speak to a manager - turns out it was Melissa again, who reiterated her message of being behind.

I explained I understood this, and that they needed to find a better way to manage client expectations.  I totally understand a backlog, but I also appreciate customer centric communication.  In this area, they fell down.  As we were wrapping the call, the driver showed up (an hour after the order was placed) and caught on to the situation.  She was apologetic and asked if the manager offered a credit or something - which she hadn't.

This location needs more customer focused management and a better way of managing expectation.  Pizza Hut lost a customer tonight...."}
{"text":"Restaurant review
I was a bit concern with the dated reviews and there was no mention of lunch buffet either in the prior yelps, however I decided to come here for lunch armed with a 4.99 lunch buffet coupon req. drink purchase. I was pleasantly surprised that my experience was not as bad compared to reviews 3 years ago. The server was quick to seat our family. Pretty much everyone was going for the lunch buffet at this hour. For 6.79 lunch AYCE buffet you get multiple thin and pan crust pizza with variety of toppings. Some resembled the meat lover with just a few less topping, one pasta that was unfortunately over cooked with limp noodles, but good amount of cheese and pepperoni, a salad bar with iceberg lettuce and other fresh veggies, breadsticks+ marina sauce, and finally cinnamon sticks which were delicious. The pizza variety continues to rotate so you never know what kind of pizza you can get. There is one server really for the whole room, but she still was able to check in on our table and refill our drinks. All and all good if you like pizza buffet, but you can order a large specialty for 10 dollars for a bit cheaper. 

Pro: AYCE lunch pizza buffet M-Fri, not on Sunday though even though the placard says Sunday

Cons: Very overcooked pasta

Hidden gem:
Check online for coupons before ordering, check your mailer as well for coupons. FYI the 4.99 buffet coupon is for one person only not everyone in your party."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery from here. 
Delivery driver was rude. Pizza was undercooked (still doughy).
I will never eat here again. 

If you're a fan of Pizza Hut you'd be better off going to the birchmount and ellesmere location."}
{"text":"I got here at the time it was said that my pizza was to be ready. Not only was my pizza not ready but they forgot to cook the side that I had ordered as well and was told I'd have to wait. Why give a time for completion if it won't be ready and you FORGET to cook half my order?"}
{"text":"Who orders a pizza and has to wait 4 HOURS for delivery with no communication from the establishment? I haven't experienced anything like it."}
{"text":"Ok. I get it, I made the typo in my phone number in my online order, but the address was right... when I call to find out where my order is, I am told that if they can't verify the phone number, they cancel the order... I actually don't have too large of an issue with this, but at least offer to make it right and rush me a new order."}
{"text":"I really wanted Tropical Smoothie but the line was out the door and since they're pretty slow normally and I'm short on time I decided to pop into the empty Pizza Hut two doors down. BAD IDEA!

It was $10 for a medium hand tossed cheese only pizza. They can't do small unless it's the deep dish crust. Here's the kicker, it was a 20 minute wait! I would have been better off waiting in the line at Tropical Smoothie for a cheaper, healthier, quicker bite to eat. NEVER AGAIN!"}
{"text":"Very pleased with my visit here was able to get my discount for the $7.99 large pizza with just ordering over the phone, and telling them about the Yelp coupon. Fast and friendly service for Super Bowl... Will always come back to this location."}
{"text":"The service at this location is horrendous. 

1. I arrived, and my first and last name was on their customer service TV screen facing the lobby. Like ok, put my first name, but do you have to put my last name?
2. Waited at the counter for help with pickup. Two employees looked at us as they walked by and didn't say anything. Had to wait for someone to emerge from the back. 
3. The cashier told us the total and didn't offer us drinks or add on. No crushed red pepper or parmesan. 
4. I ordered a vegan pizza. He proceeded to hand me a cheese triple meat. Didn't even open the box. If I hadn't looked, then I would have gotten back to the office and opened a pizza I couldn't eat. 
5. I ordered a no cheese with veggie. Pictured is what I got. Since all I get is vegetables, most places are generous with the toppings. I got ripped off on the bread with sauce I ordered."}
{"text":"Pretty much grew up eating here. Pizzas have kept the same quality for all these years. Good service."}
{"text":"We normally enjoy Pizza Hut food, but this locations claim to \"made to order\" is erroneous. One simple order of thin crust pepperoni pizza cut into squares was too complicated for these employees."}
{"text":"So I called a random Pizza Hut, found out they won't deliver to my house.  They give me the number of the closest Pizza Hut.  I call them.  They don't deliver to my house either, but I can come pick it up.  So, I order my pizzas for all the folks there watching the game that night (Night is actually an important detail here) and about 10 minutes later I drive on over.  I can't help wondering why this location just 8 minutes away from my house doesn't deliver.  

Now I know.

The Pizza Hut doesn't have a door. It has a window.  Yes, a window.  More in the \"Protective\" than the \"Decorative\" sense of a window.  There are 3 groups already there ahead of me.  Two look quite respectable, one... well-l-l........quite a bit less so.  One group picks up their pizza.  Down to 3 of us.  The other group is a small family and they are ordering right at the window and are going to wait for it to be ready.  Scary guy, who's been kinda twitching and not making eye contact, says I can go ahead of him.  Thank goodness!  I grab my pizzas and I'm out of there.  

While the pizza was fine there (not impressive but didn't make me sick), I am never, ever, ever picking up pizza here alone at night.  

Ever."}
{"text":"I ordered a personal pan sized pizza. The delivery arrived  before the estimated time and the delivery driver was very nice. I loved the pizza nothing to complain about."}
{"text":"This is the worst place to order pizza. I don't know why I continue to use this store. I ordered online and after an hour and a half I called to ask what's going on and the response was, we're getting your order in the over now. It takes 1 1/2 hours just to get the food ready to put into the oven?!?! This is the norm for this store! It shouldn't take an hour and half to get a pizza! Worst location in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Ordered a pizza for deliver at 3:08 on a Wednesday. Waited over an hour and 15 min, nothing arrived. Spent another 10 minutes calling the location, as nobody would pick up. 

Finally reach someone. Who tells me that my pizza is just leaving for delivery as we speak. My order will be at my door in 15-20 minutes. 

I live within less than  a 5 minute drive from this location.

No explanation as to why such a delay was given. No apology, nothing. Avoid this location at all costs!!!!!"}
{"text":"We happen to be near this pizza hut and the location is less to be desired kinda in a bad area  of boulder hwy but we wanted to get some pizza.  

The first couple of times we had been to this location the pizza it was not bad that was a few years back.

This last time we went it was not the best. We ordered pizza to eat inside. 
The taste was not that good plus it seems as if they just don't put enough toppings on. Extra cheese was the same amount as if you had regular on it. The pizza don't seem to be done enough either. We like the crust to be a little crispier not too doughy. Maybe there was a new cook or something. 

The pictures that are posted with a ton of toppings is not realistic for here.

The people that work here of course different every time we have been but are always pleasant..
We gave it a few chances and I think the last time did us in. The pizza just wasn't that good."}
{"text":"Ordered a med pepperoni pizza tonight at 5:45. Girl on the phone said it would be ready in 15 minutes. I live 2 minutes away so I rented a movie and was 4th in line for the pickup window at 6:00pm. The line curled through the lot and was backed up to Kent Rd. By 6:05. One man had to get out (in the blowing sleet and snow) and ask to cut through the line to park in the handicapped area. I didn't get to the window until 6:26pm. Once at the window you could see everyone taking care of the check in area and just blatantly ignoring the pick up window. A man finally, 6:33pm, slid open the window and asked how I was doing. I said \"annoyed,\"  and that my pizza was now 30 minutes old and cold. He laughed and said \"yeah, we are swamped.\"  I counted at least 6 employees visible from my car window. He never apologized or assured me my pizza was still hot. In fact it was less then luke warm, very greasy and the cheese had started to separate and get weird. Terrible experience, terrible pizza. I'll drive further for better customer service."}
{"text":"placed an order to pickup and I arrived when it was ready but no one greeted me or said \"we'll be right with you.\" 5 minutes later after standing there someone finally came up and rang me out. Super rude and I will not be returning."}
{"text":"BUG ALERT:
We normally order from this place for our business and they are always good on delivery time. However this time, our personal pizza came with a personal bug in it. Looks like it was baked in it. Only reason I made it two stars are the delivery guys. They are always on time and nice. Will keep PH off the list for now."}
{"text":"I ordered on a Friday night at 5:50 and the driver never found our house.  He called twice and never found our house when it has been here for 9 years, not a new build!  He wasted two hours of our time and hunger waiting for a pizza that never came."}
{"text":"Never again!  Waited two hours, spoke to driver twice and manager, never got our pizza!"}
{"text":"As a preface, I'll point out that even though what follows is a generally negative review, when it comes to the major delivery chains, Pizza Hut is the lessor of three evils being that Domino's and Papa John's Pizza are severely homophobic companies that don't deserve any kind of support (in the case of of Papa John's, their bigotry is homegrown as their Phoenix Director of Operations Christina Carter has emailed gay customers telling them to take their business elsewhere - apparently with the company's support as no one in the company has issued any kind of apology or acknowledgement that her actions were horribly wrong.)  

So I've made it a point to order more from Pizza Hut as I refuse to give my business to Domino's or Papa John's - and there has been some things working in their favor - their new menu has a lot of interesting options and I've enjoyed sampling the new styles.  I also have to give a special kudos for the one time when a delivery driver forgot part of my order, went back to the store and delivered the missing item - and still managed to accomplish both trips within the promised time!  (A severe contrast to Papa John's who not only once only brought only one out of four ordered items but after the driver left to supposedly retrieve them, ended up not coming back!)

The downside though is that Pizza Hut tends to be more expensive, has less value in its pricing and offers less specials of substance.  While PJ often has free pizza or 40-50% off specials, a typical PH promotion is 10% off or a discount on breadsticks.  As far as taste, the items can be hit or miss - their pan pizza in particular is very doughy and not very tasty.  The breadsticks are completely dependent on sauce to make them digestible and they often don't provide enough sauce relative to the amount of breadsticks provided.

But it's my last order in particular that will probably cause me to eat at Pizza Hut way way less often...

First of all the pizza was 20 minutes late.  I called the restaurant after 15 minutes (burning my cell phone minutes to do so which I hate having to do) and the person who answered was pretty much useless and uphelpful - I kind of got the teenager-with-their-first-job \"Like, I dunno, I just work here,,,\" vibe from them.  After the driver left and I unboxed my order, I found they had forgotten to bring an item.  

So the order itself was terribly lacking to begin with but then the response has been equally abysmal.  First of all, when I submitted my feedback, the response I got was a rambling essay about an issue that had nothing to do with the nature of my complaint!  It was like some customer service drone was just cutting and pasting a generic response - and sending the wrong form letter!  So, I recontacted them letting them know the response made no sense in relation to the nature of my complaint and then was told I'd get a response from someone from the local store...in three days.  And indeed it was a three day wait with the person basically issuing me a $5 credit - which while at least is SOMETHING, struck me as a rather minimal concession particularly considering the amount of things that were wrong with both the initial experience as well as the followup.  PLUS, in order to even use it, I have to call it in wasting my phone minutes further instead of placing a completely free order online as I always do.  

BUT that's still not the end!  Turns out that when my card was billed for the order, it actually processed for about three dollars more than what it should have been!  Now up til then while everything about the experience has been aggravating, this latest problem now borders on the ILLEGAL - since running someone's card information for an amount different than what they signed and agreed to is card fraud!  

So they really blew it big time.  They had my goodwill for a while being that they weren't engaging in bigotry and homophobia like their two chief competitors and had both my support and recommendation to others but how can I encourage other people to use them now when i directly know that (a) their service and attention to detail and customer satisfaction is lacking, (b) getting them to resolve an issue when it occurs is a maddening experience with ultimately quite minimal effort on their part to make up for things and (c) the fact that they can't be trusted with your bank/card information.

I don't know why Phoenix has such a major problem with its major pizza delivery chains!  I live in an area where there's not much stores or restaurants nearby and I don't have a car so pizza delivery is an attractive option but none of the Big Three are worthy.  I'm about ready to start taking a highly inconvenient bus ride to the nearest Little Caesar's (four miles away) for my pizza now!  (At least it is much cheaper and tastes better!) All I can say at this point is if you are looking for pizza delivery, it's much better to support your local businesses instead of going with the major chains!"}
{"text":"first off my credentials are extremely minimal as a food critic, I didn't take any business classes, no culinary management and no taste bud consummation classes or culinary art classes..  however I was a Chef and have worked in some of Seattle's most prestigious restaurants years ago, which actually doesn't really apply here right?

I'm here because I just wanted to say Thank You Pizza Hut and their driver, I was ill the day I ordered a pizza and didn't even feel like moving so the ability to order easily online then having it pop up less than 20 minutes later on my front porch was a thing to behold, and $20 bucks included the $6 tip for a real nice tasty pizza, obviously not the best in the world, no one ran down to the farmers market this morning and grabbed all the ingredients, buthcered any animals just beforehand, it was what it was, a PIZZA! mostly frozen ingredients and as fresh as a large corporation can get them to my door, show a profit and still pay the bills..

however I got what EYE wanted on MY pizza, right down to the salt n peppa! due to a special they are running right now any pizza have it your way $11... PERFECT! as never is the one I like ever on a menu, ever... light cheese, extra mushrooms, olives, extra eyetalian sausage, spiced sausage, pepperoni, and salami atop marinara red sauce bedding a large thin crust..

lets face it, not many of us are willing to get up off the barcalounger for a 20 spot much less throw a pizza together, put it in an insulated box, throw it in your car, drive a couple miles to a complete strangers house, work the gate code, then knock on a total strangers hidden door for what? minimum wage that prolly works out to be around $2 for the 15 minute effort minus preparation?

that's why instead of complaining I didn't get a 40 lb 6 star pizza for a $20 TMD I'm dang thankful there is a pizza hut, with delivery, an employee to drive to me, and $20 bills to cover the exchange and the fact I am alive and well enough to hand it to a complete stranger for said pizza..

*wink*

Thank You Pizza Hut and Employee's"}
{"text":"Initial rating: One star.
Bonus star for offering to credit my account.

Driver 45 minutes late (45 minutes after the delivery estimate, not after the order). Pizza was cold because it wasn't in one of those awesome pizza-warmer things. It was in a plastic bag. So the pizza was cold and the cardboard was soggy. The cheese had congealed, so by that point it was disgusting.

I called to let them know, got a hold of a manger right away. They offered to cook the order again, but I didn't want to wait another goodness knows how long for two personal pans. So they credited my account. Not bad, just hope I can use it elsewhere."}

{"text":"The stars are for the service but, the food is absolutely gross. My dad orders pan crust pizza and it smells like vomit. The cheese from this location must be rotten because it smells so off. I've noticed that almost all the pizza places in this area have off smelling and tasting cheese. Something needs to change here because I won't be buying pizza from here not letting anyone else in my family buy from here. I wish I could rate this place higher because the people are nice and the orders are fast but the food is off putting."}
{"text":"Growing up, pizza hut pizza was the BEST.  I'm not just saying that because of Book Club.

I'd ordered pizza hut about a year or two ago and it was pretty atrocious.  Something on par with freezer pizza and Little Ceasars.  In the last couple of months though, I don't know if it's my perception, or my love of a deal, but the pizza hasn't been half bad!  

It has a buttery, warm and almost fluffy crust, plenty of cheese and the toppings are fresh (not canned) and ample.  Fresh mushrooms even!  

I especially like the W. 25th location.  I can get through right away (no long phone hold like some other Cleveland locations) and my pizza is always quick and ready for pickup.  

Is it gourmet?  No.  But, for the price, you can't beat it!"}
{"text":"Everytime I go to this Pizza Hut I'm treated very nicely and the food is always great!! I really don't go anywhere else for pizza because they always make it right here. Good staff good food can't complain about any of those things"}
{"text":"Surprised by the negative reviews. I've had great service and pizza here. Much better than the green valley location. Unfortunately this location doesn't deliver to my apartment complex even though it's closer distance wise. I stopped getting delivery from other location and pick up here it got so bad. Pizza and wings are always very fresh and hot. Employees working the counter are always friendly."}
{"text":"Two stars just for the BBQ wings.. They are always very good. Pizza is very hit and miss. My problem is that almost every time something is wrong with the order. Either overcooked or undercooked. If not that then the toppings are not correct or backwards from what you ordered. The last time was the worst. We specifically stated no buttery garlic spread on the crust. Told us we caught it in time and it would not be on there. Get the pizza and could completely tell they started to put it on there then realized the mistake but still tried to pass it off on us anyway. Guess can't have high expectations when it comes to a Pizza Hut."}
{"text":"They just remodelled the place and it looks much better. I think (but aren't positive) the new owners are corporate which mrans they're going to be more uniform and consistent.  Never the less the meal was as expected.  Not a unique local taste but still good. The salad bar was fresh but the bathroom was dirty.  But all things considered it was good."}
{"text":"I ordered two pizzas and one was good, the other not so much. The pizza with pepperoni and mushroom was fine. The other one, with chicken and onion, wasn't tasty and I ended up tossing it. Not sure why but perhaps the chicken wasn't cooked well and the onion also. Both chicken and onion might have been oiled and that taste transferred negatively. I'm guessing pizza with minimal toppings would be the best choice."}
{"text":"One time I came here and the literal fucking kkk was there. They all had their crosses and torches. I was surprised they fucking even served them."}

They constantly forget sauces,breadsticks dessert, etc. And every time I call to fix an order or say they forgot something the managers rudely argues and refuse to compensate for thier mistakes. Thier pizza is dry an flavorless the breadsticks always over cooked an hard as a rock hoagies are sloppy made. I would honestly avoid this pizza hut at all costs."}

I've had two messed up orders and all with clean instructions

First I order honey bbq wings they get labeled honey bbq but no sauce on them.

Another time I orders a pizza for my grandma and they didn't deliver until 2 hours later and cold. She sent it back and still took an extra 1 hour. 

I'm done with them never again will I order from them! Domino's all the way!!!!! 

Pizza Hut on jones and Lakemead can quote me!!!!"}
{"text":"We ordered 2 large Chicken Caesar Pizza, wings and bread stick via online to deliver to our home.
When we put the order, we chose extra tomato sauce for one, Alfredo for another (which is default), and added cheese to our bread stick.
The problem was they didn't really bother to read the specification, so we got 2 pizzas with Alfredo sauce and bread stick without cheese in it.
I don't know if they read a review, I hope they do, so they will bother to read the order properly next time."}

A FAN. The last Pizza Hut in the Las Vegas Valley with a lunch buffet. 

Nice selection of pizza, pasta and bread sticks; even a dessert pizza.

We WILL be back."}
{"text":"Overly priced pizza and wings that can't even be enjoyed. This location had great customer service and my order was on time however the quality was horrible!!! I was kicking my self in the butt that I didn't head over to the next plaza and pick up frozen pizzas from target.  Wings were expensive, but only mediocre. Nothing to go back for. This was my 1st time in 20 years having Pizza Hut, and I'm proud to say it will be my last!!"}
{"text":"So, all the people who complained about the customer service are human sized babies. They were super pleasant, and fun. It's a Pizza Hut, not a freakin Benihana. Staff killed it. 10/10. Would stuff my face with pizza from here again."}
{"text":"Super disappointed. We used to get delivery service from the rainbow location and never had any issues and had fast delivery. Ever since they change for the fort appache location as our delivery spot we have waited over an hour for every delivery and the pizza is always cold! They have also messed up our order more than once. It's pretty annoying to have to wait past your expected delivery time then have to reheat your food or have the wrong food! We continue to hope for better service each time we order, and they continuously disappoint. We will be taking our service elsewhere and will be contacting corporate."}
{"text":"Friendly staff, but horrible crust on that Pizza Mia.  I admit, I was starving, desperate, and being cheap.  Mistake made."}
{"text":"I thought this 'Hut location was just fine. It's 'Hut and tastes like pretty much every other 'Hut. Decent. Not sure what the other reviews are complaining about."}
{"text":"The worst customer service and when I say the worst I mean the WORST. Erin the cashier is the most rude person I have encounter in Vegas. She should not be an employee of Pizza Hut she should give her position to a person that really wants the job because she is the worst employee I have ever seen at a Pizza Hut location. Never again going there. Hope the main corporate office see this and does something about it FIRED her she doesn't deserve the job."}
{"text":"Don't ever try to order pizza on a busy night like Halloween or super bowl ... we pre ordered our pizzas a day before for a 5pm pickup. 40 minutes later they tell us that they are \"in the oven\" ... totally unacceptable!!! Will never order from here again . Get it together Pizza Hut !"}
{"text":"We used to go to pizza hut years ago and just recently have been enjoying their pizza again!"}
{"text":"You know the pizza really sucks when on the receipt it shows you to the ounce how much topping you are getting. 

I don't know if I was supposed to see this receipt or if it was the stores copy, but I got it anyway.  Am I naive in thinking that pizza places just randomly top a pizza with your choice of toppings?  I would think that it would take more effort to measure out 0.3 oz of mushrooms than to just throw a handful on, no?

I understand the whole meat and cheese thing and yes, they are more costly ingredients where measuring them out would make some sense but SERIOUSLY measuring the veg?  Pizza Hut, you have reached a new low.

Sooo disappointed in this chain, it used to be half decent and one of my favourites about 10 years back, now I could feel the chunks emerging.

Some of the best pizza I've had were from mom and pop shops set up in surrounding neighbourhoods.  

BOOOO Pizza Hut, you should be ashamed of yourself. Little Ceasers is now better than you and that isn't saying much."}
{"text":"These idiots couldn't manage a restaurant even if their job was on the line.  arrived at 7:45pm and it's now 9:16pm and we still haven't gotten our pizza yet.  we all ran out or battery on our ipad and phones waiting for these idiots to give us our order."}
{"text":"I have been coming to this location since I was a little kid.. always loved the pizza from here. It recently began to show its age, so it was updated and is really a lot nicer than it was before. 

I usually don't dine in, so can't really comment on the service aspect, but the pizza is always great. Calling ahead before arriving saves you the hassle of waiting in the tiny front area. They estimate the times good every time, usually pulling out the pizza from the oven as I arrive. 

They currently have their reoccurring $5 deal, which simply cannot be beat in my opinion. (Buy one pizza at regular price and get the next 5 for only $5 each). 

be forewarned; there isn't much parking as the parking lot is small and fills up quickly. There is a bigger lot to the WEST of the plaza."}
{"text":"This just in! This dirty dirty chain 'za (but come on... the crust is like deep-fried) location now has $7 walk-in specials before 4pm Mon-Wednesday. You know you want to hit it. 

Now I'm going to go wash my soul..."}
{"text":"Oh the shame! Thoughta changin' my name! But hell, I was glad when my greasy pizza came. 

When it comes to shameful delivery, nothing comes close to the dirty hut. Well, mabye KFC? But we're talking about pizza right now.

This location has very long delivery hours, lunch specials and a proper buffet,  if you're ever brave enough to eat in. It's the definition of a chain restaurant, though, so no matter how much I relish in it's greasy goodness, I can't with a good conscience give it more than three stars. 

Pregnant? Hungover? Need a pepperoni pick-me-up? You know the number..."}
{"text":"I've only got two complaints. First one is that it is EXTREMELY slow. Ordered one large pizza a week or two ago. My wait time was an hour and a half. Secondly, they don't always get the order right. I've only ordered online, and my experience with this location is that 70% of the time, I don't get my order. I get something different. Sometimes COMPLETELY different. This place is fine if you need something cheap and filling, but there's really nothing else exceptionally positive to say."}
{"text":"You know what separates this Pizza Hut from all the others? The fact that you can sit down at a table and enjoy your freshly cooked, greasy piece of oven baked goodness. To me, all Pizza Huts are all the same in terms of food taste, price etc.... it takes something like the ability to sit down at a table like the good 'ol days to make them stand out."}
{"text":"Years ago in a far away place, I got burned out of Domino's, Papa John's and all the other major chain pizza joints, but not Pizza Hut for some reason. Maybe it's their grease soaked pan pizza crust, the tomato sauce or the baked in cheese of their stuffed crust pizza that always keeps me going. Or maybe it's the cheap $10 pizza deals they have been running lately that have been bringing me back to this place time and time again. Regardless, good times!

Thank you pizza hut for always being there to keep my stomach full and happy when I am to lazy to cook. Plus, online ordering kicks ass!"}
{"text":"Customer service  sucks every time man. This the only Pizza Hut my be so it sucks have too deal with this."}
{"text":"Everything was great (: and got my pizza hot !!! Every nice eat in too. They have a tv see your name"}
{"text":"Pizza Hut's website for some reason doesn't recognize that 2 of the streets in our subdivision exist. Despite our being within 5 miles of 3 locations. Every time we call, the location tries to have us call a different location, which is a pain. So we finally started just submitting our orders online for the street behind us and putting in the notes the street we're actually on. It worked twice just fine, on the third try we were contacted by a manager and told that they don't like us doing this because it confused their drivers. They've obviously made no effort to contact someone higher up to fix this glaring error. I've submitted multiple requests since we moved here almost 2 years ago to no avail. I just found this manager to be incredibly rude and I think from now on we'll have to order from a different pizza place. Which really bums me out."}
{"text":"I haven't had Pizza Hut for several years. The last time I had it, I remember it being very greasy and flavorless. So, I figured I'd try them again since it's been about 10 years. 

Now, I love pizza, there are certain things I look for in pizza which I list on all my pizza reviews.

Flavor: Surprisingly not there. There is so much grease that I'm sure that the flavor was grease flavor.
Cheese Pull: It didn't stick to the crust, instead, it all slid off when picking up a slice.
Crust: It acts like a sponge for the grease.
Price: Avg.
Cold Test: DO NOT EAT IT COLD, IT GOT WORSE.
Next day test: Each slice was glued to the box from the grease causing each slice to tear apart. 

Overall: See you in another ten years I guess."}
{"text":"this is not a good place to order from. We used to go here at least once a week. Tired of terrible food and service!"}
{"text":"Pizza hut! Oh how I love your online ordering system when I refuse to drunk dial for food :)

I can't complain. My pizza is always good and delivered on time. You all know what Pizza Hut tastes like, so I won't go into the gooy greasy goodness factor.

I refuse to eat Papa Johns, Little Caesars, or Dominoes (gag me with a wooden spoon). Utilize Pizza Hut's online or even texting system. The estimated time for delivery is normally longer than you really have to wait. 30 minutes and pizza is served!"}
{"text":"I did an online order from this Pizza hut. They showed up ahead of schedule with exactly what I ordered. No complaints. Of course the delivery guy was less than friendly, but what do you expect? I'd be pissed being above the age of 21 on a Friday night delivering pizzas to a bunch of drunks too. :)

They'll deliver until 11pm.

Just a note: Don't try that new Pizza Mia Pizza. Go with the originals. I haven't tried it, but if you look at online reviews it's crap. Yes, it's cheap, but it's Pizza Huts new \"budget\" pizza and tastes like sweetened cardboard and cheese with oregano sauce. Worse than Domino's. No thanks."}
{"text":"Wow I wish there was something lower than one star to give these people, I ordered dinner tonight, it took longer than they promised, and when my order got here half the order was missing. When I called the restaurant and spoke to the manager Phil he said there were some really much he could do about it other than get it to me in the next 45 minutes, he wouldn't redo my order he was pretty much a total ass.

I will never ever order from Pizza Hut again. I seriously encourage everyone who leads this review to go with either dominoes or Papa John's, shoot even little Caesars is better!"}
{"text":"When I ordered online, I paid with card of course but had cash in hand for tip. When the delivery guy gets to my door he hands me the receipt to sign and I noticed the tip area was circled lol. Immediately I was annoyed but hey, I'm the type of person to always tip! I wrote zero on the paper n gave it back then reached into my pocket for the tip, he looks at it with irritation and says \"oh was my service bad? No tip for me? Wow.\" And I take my hand out of my pocket and tell him \"no sorry, money is tight right now\" he laughs and replies \"no tip for me but you can buy pizza\". Mind you my kids are beside me and I'm looking at him like you are so lucky I'm trying to get right with God and be an example to my kids otherwise I would've slapped tf out of this old man! I told him of course I can order pizza, my kids are hungry they wanted pizza but I don't have to tip you! Smh idk this drivers name but I received an email to review the place and told them what happened. Resa and Hannah the AGM were very helpful. I'd go negative stars but because of them it's not."}
{"text":"Order 4 pizzas. 3 of 4 incorrect.  The topping were terrible. Combinations no one would order.   When called they were rude, constantly  put on hold.  Told my 30.oo order was really 60.00. Implying I should be satisfied with whatever.  After lots of recalling,  we were told to return to store for correction.   With four hungry kids and miles to go not feasible.  Love Pizza Hut. WILL NEVER RETURN TO FOREST HILL STORE AGAIN!!"}
{"text":"If I could give this place a negative gazillion I would just got my pizza yeah I know it's Pizza Hut but come on man a piece of cold card board with cheese and a couple pieces of sausage on it not to mention they didn't put the black olives or onions that I ordered on it. Oh did I mention the cheese was dark brown? 

I recommend you never not ever order from this place!!!!! You will be wasting your money- my pizza is in the trash for anyone who wants it!

It was so bad I wouldn't even feed it to my dog or the squirrels outside - the absolute worst pizza I have ever attempted to eat - I say attempted because after two bites I tossed it in the trash. 

They asked me if I wanted a credit - hell no I don't want a credit - I want their driver to come give me my twenty bucks back cuz it was plain and simple highway robbery!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Ok, so i dont usually pick up, I usually have it delivered and these people are just awesome. My pizza always is so good  
It looks amazing and tastes even better, not going to lie, I probably shouldn't be here as much as I do but whatever. It's cheat day"}
{"text":"I will always be hard-pressed to understand why Pizza Hut in Canada is twice the price of its US counterpart. 

Even more questionable - this location doesn't deliver to Cote St. Luc even though it's on the cusp of the neighborhood - go figure! No amount of begging, pleading and willingness to compensate will urge the manager or staff to trek the extra mile.... REALLY?!

Food's decent, the wait can be long, the service can suck, it's a toss up.

I've had a really lousy server experience here once, it was extremely disappointing - waitress pretty much told me and my friend (both of us girls) that two pizzas would be too much food for us - RUDE and made a comment about how we almost came close to finishing them both off - EVEN MORE RUDE... then took 30 minutes to bring the bill. I spoke with the manager who neither apologized nor made any effort to resolve the issue. Charming.

Anyhow, I stick to take out and avoid dining in because of this experience... the take out line is slow and like I mentioned previously - they don't deliver to my hood. 

Thankfully, I moved to the US and get Pizza Hut for half the price WITH delivery. SCORE!"}
{"text":"Every time we order from this place they mess something up. Most recently they just didn't show up for our delivery at all. When I called they tried to blame me for it and showed up over 3 hours later! The time before that they messed up both one topping pizzas (how do you even manage that?) and the time before that the manager put me on a \"no credit ever\" list because I wanted my pizza fixed (I didn't ask for a credit I offered to pay). I've never not had a problem with this place I just keep ordering because it's close and tastes good even if they get it wrong.
I've had the district manager call me to actually blame me for their faults and accuse me of lying just because he didn't want to apologize for the manager being rude and dirty looking (like he just rolled out of bed).
All in all we have one coupon for a free pizza and then we are done with this place. Time to start ordering from somewhere else because it just isn't worth it."}
{"text":"Pizza is ALWAYS doughy in the middle, even when we specifically request that it be \"done\" in the middle. Unfortunately this is the only PH to deliver to us. Won't be ordering from them again. 3 strikes, you're out."}
{"text":"I've had no problems until recently. Last time I ordered, they forgot one of my items. They gave me a $10 credit. Now it happened again. 2x in a row. A delivery guy came and forgot my 2 liter Pepsi I paid for. He's said \"I'll go back and get it\", I am 3 minutes down the road. 1.2 miles. I felt bad for the kid, so I tipped him more then what I normally would. He delivered at 11. Location closed at 11. Thing is I didnt touch my food, I was waiting for him. He NEVER came back. Now, first, I want to drink pop when I eat pizza. Other reason was I had a migraine. I needed the caffeine. So I called the location. It's said \"location is closed, if your calling about an order you didn't receive stay on the line, a staff member will be right with you. I waited 20 minutes and hung up. So guess what, they stole my money. I paid for Pepsi and didn't get it, and I over tipped the driver to not give me my order. I'm furious."}
{"text":"Really poor quality since back when it was good it's been at least 20 years however, unfortunate as the delivery man was very professional and friendly"}
{"text":"Pizza Hut used to be a decent delivered pizza.  But its gotten to the point its like eating cardboard covered in what tastes like fake cheese and sauce they got out of a jar and added some cheap spices.  Don't get fooled by the 1/2 price deal.  Free is to much to pay for this poor excuse for pizza."}
{"text":"Conveniently located in Westgate Resort and Casino,this Pizza Hut is a great express value meal for hotel guest... the are located right in front of north tower entrance of the resort...

The staff are helpful and they prepare fresh pizza upon ordering... so it taste great and warm..."}
{"text":"Hats off to Daniel and his crew. We order from here about once a week and for the first time we had an issue with our delivery. It was on 9/11 during football and our pizza arrived cold. I called and Daniel and he had no excuses, he just offered to replace our entire order even though it was only the pizzas that were the issue. I called today to see if they had remembered me and sure enough, the young lady who answered had my entire order in front of her on the computer. They replaced the entire order and brought it out in 20 min. Everything was excellent and hot and fresh. Awesome customer service and we will continue to order from this location!"}
{"text":"if I ordered pizza I want pizza .......if u said 6:45 and meant 7:30 then your right on .....racheal.......brush up on your customer service skills and delivery driver with sweat pouring off of you no thx"}
{"text":"It took a full 90mins from the time I ordered until I had my pizza delivered, which was cold when it arrived. The driver left out part of my order and I spent 20mins on the phone trying to reach customer service to have him come back. I will never, ever, ever order from Pizza Hut again."}
{"text":"Your store SUCKS!!! I can never order any if the specials for delivery from your store. I always run into stupid situations not only about specials but also you guys have ran out of Large pizzas (unbelievable but true). What sucks the most is that my area is assigned to the MOST TERRIBLE pizza hut I've ever encounter with. I'm done with pizza hut. I guess Dominos it is."}
{"text":"Bad service. Ordered online. Pizza not ready when promised. Staff has a bad attitude towards costumers."}
{"text":"Almost 2 hours to get a pizza delivered. They couldn't find the driver. They argued and argued and refused to take responsibility for this. Horrible horrible service on the phone. Terrible customer service."}
{"text":"I can't believe I'm giving a junk food pizza chain 5 whole stars..but this place is great! Probably one of the best Pizza Hut's I've been to. I always get my pizzas delivered from this place (Can't always go to Cibo!) and they are always consistently awesome! Not sure why the other reviewers have had such a tough time...and I am a frequent customer. Perfectly greasy flaky crusts, and excellent fresh toppings. Pizzas are always delivered ahead of their approximated schedule and are always piping hot. I don't have a bad thing to say about this place. I never order anything else but their pizza.  I just encourage them keep up the consistency and freshness and customers will be very happy!"}
{"text":"This Pizza Hut is Seems to be out of Stuffed Crust more than a lot. It's almost as if they aren't ordering correctly. This is the 4th time I have ordered and had no success with stuff crust in a row. I order about every 3 weeks or so. The stuffed crust for me is why I even go to Pizza Hut. 
Without the stuff crust the Pizza is just average at best and I'll take a $5 from little caesars or one from Tropicana Pizza rather than pay Pizza Hut prices; and I have. 
Just like tonight I have also ordered from the Pizza Hut on nellis location (Most of the time I'll just buy from a competitor out of pure annoyance) and I picked it up instead of delivery if I really want the stuffed crust, because the lakemead & Hollywood location is again out of stuff crust. 

Wake up Hollywood & lake mead location your customers are not happy & your losing money to your competitors. 



And update 


Still no stuff crust the last 3 times I've tried to order smfh! Don't waste your money here!!"}
{"text":"This place is absolute crap. My bf and I ordered 2 pizzas tonight for delivery at 6:40pm. First, the person on the phone taking the order tells us the total for 2 mediums is going to be $32. My bf says hmm doesn't that seem a little high she says yea hold on. Puts him on hold. Comes back and says ok it'll be $18. Bf says for two pies right? She says yes for two pies it'll be about 45 minutes. An hour later someone calls from Pizza Hut and says that he can't find our street. Turns out lady who took order wrote our address wrong. Delivery finally shows up at 8:15 and comes with one pizza. We ask him where the other pizza and he says oh I'm not sure I'll call her and head back to the shop and get your other pizza. No one called us. No apology, nothing. So finally when no second pizza shows up by 9:45, I call the shop and there is NO ANSWER! It just kept ringing and ringing. I will NEVER eat here again. We ALWAYS order from R&B's pizza downtown and thought we would try a different place for once. Bad choice. I'll go back to the locals downtown who deliver in 30-40 minutes all the time with excellent food. Shop local! Not this piece of crap franchise establishment."}
{"text":"Worst. Experience. Ever. Tonight.

What should have taken a 3 minute phone call took a 30 minute phone call to order some pizza and wings. The guy was seriously frustrating me because he didn't know anything and couldn't answer any of my questions. On top of that, the order went to the wrong house. Took over an hour. And the food wasn't even correct or great. And we still had to pay.

Over cooked and sloppy pizza. 
No sauce. 
No cheese. 
Burnt pepperonis. 
Bone out instead of bone in wings.

Clearly a bunch of wrongs.
Changed our minds about Pizza Hut, and now we're gonna have to get our pizza somewhere else. 

Avoid avoid avoid!!!!"}
{"text":"The pizza is good here but the price is too much ... I was sold a 2-topping medium pizza for $16... .. when I got there to pick up my pizza ... I saw a sign in the window that said they had a large 2-topping sale for $7.99 and I was not offered the special when I ordered.... i would have been happy to have the medium pizza at a large pizza price........I could have refused to purchase the over priced pizza but instead I rather tell the people about their lack of knowledge to help customers save money"}
{"text":"Last minute potluck for UFC 205 viewing, so I decided to find the Pizza Hut location on the way and placed a pickup order. I was a few minutes late of the time when the pizza is supposed to be ready for pickup, so after finding this location, I was in and out in about 4 minutes. Had I paid cash, I would have saved me 2 minutes.

The lady that helped me with my pickup order showed me the pizza, asking if it looked good and I was satisfied with the order, which from the photo I posted looks good (better than all the other photos uploaded for this location to date).  

It is not the greatest pizza available in Las Vegas, but for $10.82 it is well worth it. And the pizza crust did not taste greasy, which has been mine main complaint about Pizza Hut pizzas."}
{"text":"This is the worst pizza hut EVER. It took over an hour and a half to have it delivered (the place is literally 5 minutes from my house & i ordered a fight on TV so I didn't want to leave my house to pick it up!) 

So anyways, I ordered a pizza with double mushroom on half of the pizza and when it came, it had maybe like 5 mushrooms on it. lol. And I am a buffalo wing fanatic so of course i ordered extra crispy wings with mild sauce on them. They were completely in-edible. I had one wing and threw the rest out ($15 in the trash). The food was also all pretty much room temperature when I got it.

And the thing that irked me the most was that I was giving the delivery guy a cash tip and I asked if I should put that on the receipt I signed when I payed with a credit card. Can you believe this guy actually tried to trick me into putting down a tip on the credit card on top of his cash tip. lol.

Never ordering from this place again!!!"}
{"text":"I have had a bad experience here before but with that being said the past few times I had visited or ordered from here has been a lot better.

I called at 10:55 to place an order the guy answers and says can u call back when we're open and hangs up.

{"text":"This place gets a 3 star because they've never blown my socks off with anything, but I've never had experience with them that made me want to quit pizza. It's pretty close to my house and my nephew loves pizza so I'm here a decent amount. They're very consistent, very friendly and my food is always ready on time. On the single time my order was messed up, they were very quick about fixing it,  which was majorly appreciated. To be honest I have nothing bad to say about them at all. They get the job done"}
{"text":"I am a regular customer here, never with any issues until today. My pizza was a saltine cracker. I called to let them know I was upset and the pizza needed more dough, the employee was very unapologetic and I was left with my cracker crust pizza."}
{"text":"I've come here several times for lunch. The first time was the worst...I came here for lunch with a friend and the server was speaking a bit fast, so when he asked if we wanted the buffet or menu, I asked how much the buffet was, and heard $18.99. So I thought, lunch buffet is NOT worth $18.99. I ordered a small pepperoni pizza from the menu. I get my pizza, finish it, am still hungry. So I asked how much the buffet was again and had to ask \"8.99? not 18.99?\" in order to understand. He didn't have bad english. I just think we were both speaking too fast...

So then I thought, great, if I can just get the buffet price, that would be worth it. I asked that SINCE the pepperoni pizza is IN the buffet, if I could just pay the buffet price. The server, a man with curly hair about 5'9 that appeared south asian, said yes, we could definitely do that. He said it with a smile. Everything is great. But then when it came to bill payment....it became a storm. Our server finished his shift and an east asian man with not the greatest customer skills billed us for both my pepperoni pizza and the buffet. We explained that we talked to our previous server and he said we could get the buffet price, and that's the only reason we did the buffet. We would not have done the buffet had he said no. After about 5 minutes of back and forth at the cash-out station, they finally said they could do this for us: to charge us for the buffet lunch but that we can't do it again. That this is a one-time thing. As if this is premium customer service on their part. Riiiiight. Maybe get your communication between staff members in check?

It was preposterous. That experience was 1/5. I've come back a few times after with other friends just for the lunch buffet after that. It has been pretty decent so far. Sometimes the pizza on the buffet table is a bit cold, but hey, $8.99 buffet. 


A side note: leaving the plaza is incredibly awkward. You have to leave from the No Frills end, and honestly, there are crazy drivers in this particular plaza."}
{"text":"One of the only reasons I order from Pizza Hut is because of their pretzel crust, which happened to be the only thing they forgot in my order..
So I call them and they reluctantly tell me they will remake, it but I have to return the pizza I already received.. 
So an hour an a half later I still haven't received anything, waiting with a whole cold pizza..
So I call again, in which they tell me it's in route, no more than that. 
Finally they show up with a new pizza.
I ask them what they will do with the pizza I'm giving back, and they say they're just going to trash it...which seems like such a waste..
I don't think I'm going to order from here again..Even if its right down the street. This isn't the first mistake they've made...resulting in a negative attitude towards the customer... I love Pizza Hut a lot...but this one location has given us issues..."}

Will cancel your order and not deliver it and leave you hungry without telling. Worst service by any company ever."}

They charge for delivery and still want you to tip the driver.. but the sucky time restrains are to damn crazy"}
{"text":"I have ordered both carryout and delivery from this Pizza Hut location and will continue to do so because customer service is excellent and they always have some pretty good deals going on. 

The employees are very friendly, in-person and over the phone. They don't mind going over all specials that they have and they always apologize if the pick up line gets long. Also, the food is always hot, fresh, and ready or delivered on time. It may not be the best pizza out there, but I think its still pretty good for the price.

Here are some of the deals they have right now:
-Mondays: 2 medium pizzas (up to 3 toppings) for $6 each
-Tuesdays: $10 pastas
-Wednesdays: wings are $.50 each
-Carryout special: $10 large pizzas (up to 3 toppings). I always take advantage of this one!

They are also located near Yogoyum, my favorite frozen yogurt place!"}

To cook 2 pizzas and wings AND drive it over in that time? Crazy. When I ordered, I got an estimate delivery time of 3:57. They beat that by 30 min. Love it. Good job, y'all!!"}

{"text":"::This review is for the lunch buffet::

A group of 7 of us who work together came here yesterday for lunch. It's close to the office, and a nice quick option when you want to get out of the office but don't have a ton of time. We were seated right away. It was busy inside, but not crazy. 

Our drink orders were taken right away. I found it very strange that they do not keep lemons on hand. I had asked for lemon in my iced tea, and my coworker had asked for lemon in her water. Instead, we received lemon juice packets. Super strange and not the same. 

The buffet itself was fine. The salad bar was well stocked and I was able to make a nice delicious salad. The dressing selection is slim. I like a balsamic vinaigrette - which is pretty common - and there was none. There was white wine and red wine vinegar, as well as ranch, french, and thousand island. I would have appreciated a balsamic anything, but it wasn't the end of the world. The salad items seemed fresh and everything I took tasted great. 

The pizza selection was slim pickins. I would think that during the busy lunch hour they would have more available, but I guess not.The area in which the pizza's were placed was not very large, so I guess they have space constraints to work with too. The pastas were hard to get! Every time a new pan was brought out, it was devoured. I was able to get some of the red sauce pasta and it was very good. I also had some taco pizza, which is one of my faves, so I was happy. 

Our server was nice. Nothing special, but then again it is a buffet so the server's job is minimal. 

All in all, it's a great quick, cheap, and easy option for lunch and I would return."}

My order was correct and very tasty. My consumer, let me try his order and that barbecue sauce on the pie, was very flavorful. I may, have to order one, in the future. Although, my visit to this location, was brief, Amanda, the staff member, was very friendly and even gave me, some marinara sauce for free. Her tip, was rightfully earned. If, the constancy, of this location continues to improve, I will, stay forever loyal.

CHEERS!!"}
{"text":"This is the rudest Pizza Hut Ever! I ordered a pizza online from them as I have done many times. They called me and I missed the call. I called right back in less than a minute. I asked I missed a call from you. I was told they had no drivers. I said okay I will come and pick up the order. They told me my order was cancelled already. I said put the order back in so I can pick it up. She hung up on me. I did not raise my voice or use foul language therefore No reason to hang up. 

I placed a complaint and I have heard Nothing. While Pizza Hut South Taylor...Goodbye. You just lost a loyal customer. I tried to stay but this was the last straw. I kept ordering despite the bad orders and late deliveries! Good Luck!!!"}
{"text":"Pizza is pretty gross.  They rarely ever even get the order correct and far too I've priced for the quality.  The cheese is always only on about 1/2 of the pizza and delivery takes forever."}

{"text":"The quality of the Pizza Hut gets worse every single time. They almost always do not follow my cooking instructions, have seen chicken in my veggie pizza, crust is either too oily or not cooked enough, the pizzas have lost flavor. It's sad to see their brand dying. I have old very fond memories of Pizza Hut and I'm not sure if it is just  his particular store, but I likely will never order again."}
{"text":"Although I try to stay away from the mega chain restaurants, this place is good in a pinch.  I've never had any issues with the food or employees here. The  people working there are very cool and friendly.  I've only gotten carryout, so I can't comment  on delivery.  

The Wingstreet chicken wings are actually really good! Crispy and tender...better than BW3's for sure and leaps and bounds over what the wings used to be like when I worked at Pizza Hut in '99-'00.

No complaints about this location!  Plus they have a drive-thru!"}
{"text":"Very slow on delivery. I ordered online and it said it would take 35 minutes which turned into a hour. I called to check on my order and no one answered the phone, I was on the line for about 20-25 minutes. When my food finally got here it was cold :( better luck next time."}
{"text":"I can't Believe I haven't check in before... this place is close to home...so I loved I have them deliver pretty fast and food is good temp. But I prefer to go in myself after running errands. I place the order online to collect the points ( who doesn't want that) lol  I walk in and the manager already knows who you are, she'a awesome sauce. The bread sticks are always fresh and warm. My son just loves them. Keep up the great service..."}
{"text":"Worst Pizza Hut and worst pizza I have ever come across. Twice they have delivered me an uncooked pizza. The cheese on top wasn't even melted. Please, do yourself a favor and don't order from here."}
{"text":"Ok...can you really criticize a place that will sell you 2 large pizzas with any toppings you like for $20?

Yes an no.

Let's take the no part first.  Seriously...$20 bucks, 2 large pizzas with whatever toppings you want.  What did you think you were going to get?  Answer...serviceable pizza and a box that tastes almost like the pizza...so it's like getting extra pizza for free.

So on the yes part.  Beyond be serviceable as a pizza like substance when you're too tired or lazy to go elsewhere, it doesn't have much going for it.

Probably a 2.5"}
{"text":"Ordered 2 large, 2 topping pizzas...one pepperoni only and one pepperoni and onion.  The pepperoni pizza was ok.  The other not so much.  On the second they somehow actually managed to not get pepperoni on every slice.  As for the onion...and this is what I don't really get, there was hardly any on the pizza.  How does that happen?  But in all seriousness that seems to be a pizza hut thing.  How can you be so stingy with onion?"}
{"text":"Don't order delivery from this place. I keep thinking they are gonna be better next time and it's my mistake. Not once have they ever got the order correct. The girl Jenny at the counter hung up on me after effing the order up twice. I just don't get it how you can mess up an order with a recipe right in front of your face while you make it. The person checking it either is blind or doesn't even bother and just sends them out. I'll never go thru this place again. Delivery guy tells me is the mess up really that big of a deal?? Uhh yes it's the way I ordered it? Would you like me to give you something that you ordered but leave out a few things. ?? No? Okay then."}
{"text":"I ordered a pizza, pasta, and pop. Only the pizza was delivered and it was cold. The driver left to get the rest of the order and took 30 minutes to return. I called the store, stayed on hold for 20 minutes. I never spoke with anyone. I'll be contacting corporate."}
{"text":"A family member likes this place so I have pressed here several times.

Had to deal with them filling the order incorrectly and making the incorrect pizza. One time they offered a credit when the made the wrong pizza then claimed there was no credit when I went to use it. 

The worst thing of this located is one time I used their washrooms and found various pizza baking tools on the floor. How gross. I let head office know and nothing done about it.

I will never order again for this location."}
{"text":"Pizza Hut has always been one of my favorite pizza places since I was a kid so I have to stay loyal to my past lol but my number one fav is Numero Uno, I always have to go back to Pasadena to get my Numero Uno fix,  but in the meantime it's Pizza Hut,,,,, sigh....... but its all good.  They are fast and I have never had any issues with my pizza at the location I go to which is on blue diamond/cimmirron .
I know there are other good pizza places out there you all say but seriously I really like the taste of the pizza dough. So far so good with this location so I am sticking with what I know lol..  Happy eating xoxoxo"}
{"text":"I know there are alot of other pizza joints to go to but since I grew up on pizza hut I just keep going back I love the dough they use I would perfer numero unos but they don't have one here in Vegas. If you're like me and you like that crunchy crust type dough flavor pizza hut is the way to go . Oh childhood memories lol. Happy eating. Your fellow yelpie. Xoxox"}
{"text":"This is a common place for my wife and I to pick up pizza to go. We've never had a problem and we will keep coming back."}
{"text":"I would give this place a 0 star if possible. I ordered online and then got a phone call saying they do not deliver to my area....yet, they were the only pizza Hut that popped up in my area. 

The manager gave 25% off because I picked up the pizza which I only did because my wifes pregnant and it was 7:30pm. Our cookie box had a dirty green sauce on it, our 2 medium pizzas were 2 different sizes. 1 looked like a a normal medium and 1 was the size of a personal. When I asked the cashier he said it was a medium and would not get the manager I had spoke to on the phone for some reason.

After having to drive there, get 2 different size pizzas, dirty boxes and being hungry the only thing I wanted to do was go home. I'm sure the only reason this place stays in business is because it is the only one in the area and the actual owners obviously do not care because this is not the only negative review."}
{"text":"Early in the afternoon I'd ordered 2 pizzas to be delivered .3 miles away at 6:30 - we didn't want to leave the gathering to pick up.  I called at 5:30 to ask for it at 7 since one of our party had to be at physical therapy late.  At first they refused - then took my CC again and said 'will do'.  When the pizza was delivered a little after 7 - which was fine - the pizza was pretty cold and we had no way to reheat - we're thinking it would have tasted better if hot - seems like they still cooked for 6:30 and let sit until delivery at 7 - yup, seems that way...We'll choose someone else another time..."}
{"text":"Horrible! I've been here twice as I normally go to Longos (local and much better across the street) or papa johns (also across the street). I ordered online both times which went well until I got to the store. First time I tried to use the drive thru and was asked to go park and they would bring the food out in a bit. I was annoyed because I had already waited the amount of time the online ordering said to wait before coming. Then when I came inside I found out they had literally JUST put my pizza in the oven. So then I got to sit there another 15 minutes and watch what was probably the worst run business I have ever seen. No sign of manager level employees (I think one was there she was just horrible at managing) and no communication. Eerily quiet environment which is annoying when you're waiting on food. Then I get home and... wrong crust which is an exciting development. ANYWAYS the second time was equally horrible. I waited the predetermined amount of time as shown online (they control this in the store!!!) and came in to see the same \"manager\" turn around and tell them to PUT MY PIZZA IN THE OVEN! Are you serious?!? Twice they're that incompetent? So again I sit and wait. Damn you Pizza Hut for having delish pizza and garbage employees."}
{"text":"This location is SLOW! The food's ok, just typical Pizza Hut. Just keep in mind, that you will be waiting as this location gets overwhelmed quickly. One time we ordered delivery and waited and waited and waited and waited until we finally called and were told they were backed up on orders and would received a discount on our order. Another time, while we were in the store we sat and watched as phones rang off the hook and people came in person to order complaining that no one was answering the phone.

Definitely improvements need to be made in that department. Food's on par to other Pizza Huts so most of my issues are with the service."}
{"text":"Good pzones came here for lunch went through the drive though on st pattys day the girl greeted me in a Irish accent I thought that was pretty cool. Good was good so no complaints from me."}
{"text":"Typical run of the mill pizza hut nothing spectacular staff was friendly and the food was pizza hut quality so no complaints here. Been to one pizza hut you been to them all."}
{"text":"Our pizza is always hot and very tasty. The employees are always very respectful and helpful."}
{"text":"This Pizza Hut location is run by buffoons. They did not deliver to my place of work because I did not put an apartment number! When trying to call back, I waited on hold for 30 minutes before being hung up on. When I finally got through, the manager made a bunch of excuses and did not try to make any concessions! I will NEVER order from here again!"}
{"text":"Im just going to start by saying I was mid chew and felt something stringy, i pulled it--- it was a 5inch piece of fine, light brown hair. Disgusting.

Aside from the aforementioned additional topping, my pizza looked like it was thrown together by five year olds, with maybe 5-8 pieces of each of the 4 toppings I requested. That toppings being pineapple, mushrooms, jalapeño, and pepperoni. I might as well have ordered a cheese pizza and put the toppings on here at home.

So I called the store. The manager asked if I wanted a replacement, adding that the remainder of the pizza needed to be returned. I should have had them come get it, because I definitely will be throwing the additional 5 slices in the trash. I told her no, because I really would prefer not to ingest anything else from this establishment. She never once suggested refunding the money for the pizza, but instead a credit for next order. I took the credit(which must be used in 60 days). If anyone wants it feel free to let me know, I will not be eating here again.

I gave one star because my pizza got here on time and the delivery driver was nice."}
{"text":"I ordered online and I swear it got here in what felt like 20 minutes! Super fast and the girl who delivered my order was very sweet. 
Order was good and correct which can be rare with Pizza Hut!"}
{"text":"Very poor customer service. I ordered food at 6:20 pm online my order didn't arrive so I called to see what was going on they said my order was cancelled because of the wrong number. Keep in mind it was placed off my sisters online account. They claimed they called and she said nobody ordered pizza but she's here with me. I said ok fine can I resubmit the order they said sure. 17 mins later I get a knock on the door and there is my pizza. The pizza was cold I told the driver it was ok take the pizza back and I would call and see if they can make my order fresh. I called in and the manager said oh well I can't give u a discount or anything because your number is wrong. That's the least you could have done. Poor customer service at best please do not order from this location!!"}
{"text":"I love Pizza Hut. Like any other major food chain, its hard to get a consistent product. This pizza hut is about 70% on its game. They forgot the cheese on my pasta! That was lame. And it depends whos cooking... They skimp on the cheese a lot..."}
{"text":"after arriving at the Durango location in las vegas nv and paying, my pizza was \"lost\" and employees in the back were yelling about how unhappy they were . they said they would remake it. fine. after 20 min of waiting they offered free cinnasticks. I declined- I just want my order and a discount on it. the \"manager\" came up and offered $5 off my next order. I asked for a refund of my whole order. he rudely informed me that he doesn't have the authority to do so. id have to call his manager  I asked him to call his manager now. he finally got ahold of someone and gave me money back. I asked him if I get my pizza- he said \"no you've just wasted 30 min of your time- youre the one with your damn dogs in the car\". after an exchange of words- including him calling me a few bitc*s among other unprofessional words from him I asked him if the manger contact was on the receipt. he informed me it was and \"my names Dion, bit*ch\""}
{"text":"Picked up an order for my mom, had to wait about 10 minutes for someone to help me.  Got home and she saw that the order was wrong.  She called and was told that the order came through the system wrong.  No printed receipt as proof, just from the website.  They refused to deliver the corrected order because they don't deliver north of the 60.  We live between the 60 and southern.  Only getting 2 stars because the pizza we did get was good."}
{"text":"Some great deals are offered daily when you don't feel like spending $25 - $30 on one  pizza and want to go for quantity over quality. 

I really do like their thin and crispy crust pizza which is very tasty. 

The items that are placed on the pizza are on the thin side but for the price is not bad.

I generally do the take out because there are better deals that can be had, plus we live less than 1 mile from the store.

Will order again when I don't feel like spending a fortune for pizza."}
{"text":"Literally been waiting for 15 mins and nobody has acknowledged our presents. Never ordering here again."}
{"text":"UPDATE: After a great experience, it pains me to give this location 1-star, but after two visits to this location since then.... they've earned it. 

I placed a carryout order online and my confirmation page stated that it would take 1 hour and 15 minutes. I tried calling the location 5 times to cancel, even keeping them on speaker phone while I picked up my pizza I ordered online (while still waiting for them to answer) from another PH location. No thanks. 

***********************Old Review Below 
I favored Pizza Hut during my high metabolism years... so I figured, what the heck! 

I order online and I did appreciate the fact that I could pay once I arrived (not big on inputting my card information when ordering food). My confirmation said I would get my food in 15 minutes... I went to be drive-thru and my order was still cooking. Overall, I got my food in 22 minutes.

It was pouring down raining so the guy told me to pull around the front and he would bring my order when it was ready. And in the pouring rain... he did just that! 

My pizza was good! But the boneless wings, I'm not a fan of... but they're only $0.60 on Wednesdays (not sure if it's just this location or not) so I didn't break the bank to be disappointed."}
{"text":"After ordering at the WT Harris location and not being able to cancel my order with/pick it up for that matter, I remember this hidden gem. 

I ordered my pizza after calling to confirm that the carryout order would be ready. It was ready a little sooner and the cashier was super nice. She even apologized for the inconvenience of the other location. Looks like I will just come here next time."}
{"text":"Ordered pizza for pick up while I was on the other side of town by mccarran airport more than 25 mins away so it could be ready on time! Big freakin joke the pizza is not ready for pick up, it just went into the oven?? What the hell Pizza Hut? What the hell?

UPDATE: Screen shows two orders as ready but they are definitely not!
Oh but it gets better so I look back to the guy making the pizzas his shirt is dropping into each PIZZA AS HES PUTTING THE TOPPINGS-GROSS
So the other guy comes up with a pizza for saying it's for me, I ordered a large Hawaiian and cheese bread he tried to give me one small box with a pepperoni sausage pizza?! Comon Pizza Hut I'm at Little Cesar getting a pizza that hasn't had some guys dirty t-shirt dipped in it!"}
{"text":"When you order Pizza Hut, you mostly know what you will get. Just average, consistent pie. My house is near this location so it's my delivery store. I've worked at Pizza Hut before (driving, in store, etc...), and this one is average. I've never had a problem with them, but they've done nothing at all to make me jump out of my skin with delight."}
{"text":"I physically came here about a year ago. However, I do use their delivery service very often. Staffs are always friendly and they do deliver pizzas very quickly. My only complain is that they charge for hot peppers (This is something that was decided by the corporate and absolutely not their fault). This really defer me from ordering pizzas from pizza huts because of it. 

Other than that, I think this store is great."}
{"text":"Came here tonight as a birthday dinner and the party was 8 adults. 

First we ordered the bread sticks. They came and were drenched in oil. (I guess that's a common theme with pizza hut.) While we started that we ordered 3 pizzas and some wings.

First came a meat pizza, then about 5 minutes later the veggie pizza came, then 15 minutes later the wings came and finally 5 minutes later the cheese pizza came. This was one of the more disappointing parts of the dinner as some of us were left to wait while other people in our party ate. 

In terms of the quality the pizzas were all covered in a layer of oil but the flavours were great. The wings were buffalo mild sauce and were delicious. The sauce was nice and sticky and had enough spice. The wings were fried to perfection. No complaints with the wings.

Would I come back again. Probably not unless I'm trying to skyrocket my cholesterol levels. I think I'll stick with pizza pizza instead."}
{"text":"Worst customer service EVER ! 
I havent even gotten the food yet & Im disgusted I'm sure someone is gonna drop my pizza on the ground before I get it .
They are EXTREMELY RUDE expecially the manger Vanessa"}
{"text":"Awful- called in pizza at 7 they gave a 7:40 delivery time.  8:20 still no pizza.  Called several times was out on hold. Finally came and the order was wrong.  Zero apologies"}
{"text":"J'aime bien Pizza Hut surtout pour leur croûte farcie que j'adore bon service et livraison rapide 
Très bonne place"}
{"text":"Does anyone work here? Called about 6 times and no one wanted to answer the phone. No option for message. Online ordering was turned off. I worked at a pizza shop for 5 years and I'm not picky or unreasonable this place is just a show of bad business practice and hiring people who don't do their job that they are paid to do. Okay Pizza Hut don't take my money."}
{"text":"I've never really had a problem from this Pizza Hut location in the past. But tonight their service was horrible. As I called for a delivery service, right away the employee that answered the phone was rude. He had just handed off the phone to someone else in the middle of my order. Then when I had called back because it had been almost a hour since I had called, the same man answered the phone, turned out he was the MANAGER. I asked how much longer the delivery would take because they told me 30 minutes. He mentioned 10
More minutes and just hung up on me. Once I got the pizza I had ordered cheese and peppers as well over the phone, I asked the delivery man if he had brought some and he said \"oh it's in my car, let me go check\" left my apartment and never came back. Terrible service tonight and I will not be ordering from them again. 0 out of 10."}
{"text":"Been sitting here for a long ass time waitin on my pizza I really need this thing so I get on my phone and order this pizza and it's been a long time since i ordered it but I'm catching up on a lot of pretty little liars so I guess that's actually a good thing. Thank you Pizza Hut for having horrible delivery :) I'm changing this to a five star rating"}
{"text":"Real bad service. The salad bar was a mess and not stocked well. The woman waiting on people seemed like she did not know how to serve the public (who carries menus to only one table at a time when you have 3 tables walk in) One at our tables asked 3 times for a straw and when she finally got one the waitress didn't bother to ask if anyone else would like one too. 

The wings were good. That's about all I can say for this place. Props to the cook(s);for working in such a chaotic place"}
{"text":"The pizza just isn't that good anymore. I used to love their pizza as a kid. Marcos pizza and Grimaldis is way better. They're crust doesn't do it for me anymore"}
{"text":"Have ordered from these guys many times. Orders have been correct, and delivery drivers have been friendly. Have ordered from many Pizza Huts, and this location is pretty good."}
{"text":"Went today 1/31/16 to the Sunday buffet.  Should have had a large crowd, but only 3 tables in use.  That should have thrown a red flag, but it didn't.  Went in, the bar has slots for 6 pizzas, but 4 had empty places.  Nothing in them.  Time was 12:50, prime lunch time.  We were seated, and the waitress took our drink order.  She brought it back, and that was the last time she ever came to our table again.  We sat thru the rest of the meal with empty glasses.  The breadsticks and cinnamon sticks were empty when we arrived and were only replenished around 5 minutes before we left.  Not like they were busy, only 8 tables in use when we left.  They seem to be afraid to put out anything as if they will end up throwing it away, but when they would finally put some pizza out, the few people in there would take it all and leave nothing on the bar.  Then the bar would sit empty for 20 minutes or longer.  
There was one pasta dish put out while I was there and it lasted only 3-5 minutes.  When it was gone, they never put another one out to replace it.  
The pizza pans would sometimes sit there for stretches of time with one piece on them, and they wouldn't consolidate them onto one pan or better yet, throw them away and put out new, fresh pizzas.  Instead, they let them sit there with one or two  slices on a pan, drying out and looking awful, hoping someone would take them and they could maybe put out something else.  Guess they left it like that so they wouldn't have to work.  
The salad bar was poorly maintained, also.  
I have been to this hut in the past, and experiienced better service, but not much better.  The reason I went today was that I was hoping that it had improved since the last time that I was there, but obviously the owners don't seem to care how this place is run.  They need to take a lesson from the Hut in Monroe in front of Monroe Mall, the best Hut in the area.  It's the difference in night and day.  This place should be forced to be sold to a new franchisee who wants to keep up the integrity of the Pizza Hut name.  Until they do, this place will remain a dump."}
