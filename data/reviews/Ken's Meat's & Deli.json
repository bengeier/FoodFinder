{"text":"Friendly local market with a fantastic selection of fresh meat, salads, and bakery items. The stuffed chicken breasts and steaks are excellent choices. From the deli the egg salad is excellent and fresh. They also have elegant farmer pies, very good."}
{"text":"Burgundy Pepper Steak. Get one of these and you will understand why 5 stars isn't nearly enough! So good!"}
{"text":"good food but am confused why only sell hot food until 2pm. nice location."}
{"text":"Great for meat, Sheboygan Brats are the best and always a hit at grill outs. However, not the best place for other groceries or sides, just too expensive. STICK TO THE MEAT-TREATS!"}
{"text":"Way overpriced. Basically resells items at an insane markup. Not a true butcher either."}
{"text":"Worst service ever.  Not a real butcher shop.  Used to be good but service has deteriorated to unacceptable levels.  Twice in the last month I went in to buy product they normally have in their counter but both times there was insufficient or no product I was seeking available.  I asked the clerk if they had more and he returned to say come back in an hour.  I am not interested in making multiple trips to get product they should have in the counter.  Both times the owner/manager/butcher was on the phone and not interested in servicing my request.  I would have waited for the product if he was willing to prepare it.  I am willing to pay a premium price for good product and service, but I am done with Ken's.  I can get custom cut meats to my order, while I wait at Metro Market, by a person that is interested in providing the service."}
{"text":"Burgundy pepper steaks and stuffed chops are the best! Ken's is a solid place to go for local goods."}
{"text":"I'm kind of disappointed, on one hand I appreciate the wine selection and the fact that they carry Babcock Ice Cream, but I can't help but feel underwhelmed by the meat and deli selection.

There are several cuts of meat, but only a few 'prepared' meats. By that I mean, seasoned chicken breasts, or marinated meats, ready to throw on the grill. There was probably one bacon selection, four brats selection, on kabob, and everything else was just plain ol' meat.

Their deli lacked variety. Every salads they had available was mayo based, displayed in a lackluster shades of white. 

*sigh*

I really liked that the butchers and people working behind the deli and cash registers were very friendly, and you do get greeted as if you were a long time customer, whether that's true or not."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I go to Ken's mainly for their meat as most of their other groceries are a bit overpriced. Although they do have some specialty items we will pick up (like the cheese bread) that you can't find at the local Pink'N'Save. As far as their meat goes, you can't get any better! Like many of the other reviews mention the burgundy pepper steaks and chicken are simply the best! We also like their turkey burgers. You really can't go wrong with anything and we've tried most of their options! I don't know how they manage to pack that much flavor into their items but they do."}
{"text":"We moved into our Monona neighborhood over a year ago and ever since that day, Ken's has been a mealtime/neighborhood staple.  It's so easy to pop in and grab something delicious to throw on the grill.  They also offer a decent assortment of deli salads, pickled veggies, pies, wine, and other need-to-haves so you don't have to waste time running to large grocery stores for last-minute items.  New to Ken's?  Try one of their delicious pinwheels, or my favorite--burgundy and black pepper steak."}
{"text":"Every single thing is delicious here. I go here for my monthly freshly made deli sandwich for lunch. I almost always get the honey ham and Swiss on a croissant with green leaf lettuce, fresh, red, thinly sliced tomatoes and perfect mayo. Their pre-made salads and sandwiches are creative and fresh too. Great breads, fresh cheeses, oh and Babcock Hall ice cream!!"}
{"text":"We bought a chuck roast that for $20 and half of it was rock hard fat, which was unusable and not the kind that would render at all! Terribly disappointed in the butcher's job and that they were so willing to sell us such a fatty piece of meat.  It isn't right when you have to cut away half of the weight of the meat and still pay full price for it..."}
{"text":"I used to go here for all my hamburger and chicken.  They seem to have dropped a little in quality.  I used to be able to buy a chicken breast and cut it up and cook it without any additional trimming.  Not anymore. They aren't bad by any means, but they aren't the same as they used to be.  It's shame."}
{"text":"I stopped here after a friend recommended the place for steaks. Impressive selection! There were several cuts that are pre-marinated. The prices were extremely cheap compared to other places such as Metcalfs.

To compare, I spent almost $60 on steaks for 6 people and bought the same amount of meat here at Ken's for $20...and they were marinated. I tried the burgandy peppercorn steaks...WOW!! These guys melt in your mouth!

Usually leftovers steaks are tough but after several days in the fridge, the leftover steaks were still as tender as the day they came off the grill. I'm doing all my meat shopping here from now on!"}
{"text":"Ken's is great. We rarely have ever got bad meat here - and we've been to Ken's at least once a week for almost 15 years. 

Virtually all the steaks are great. People really like the Burgundy Pepper Steaks. The Rib Eyes and NY Strips are my favorites. 

The Sheboygan brats are fabulous. The ribs are great too - nice and meaty. When my family does burgers we always get their sirloin burgers. Really tasty.

The staff is often younger people - but they are very nice and well trained. 

The only downside would be is that it's pretty expensive - especially the non-meat products. I only get the non-meat things if I really need something and want to save a trip to the regular grocery store (but this is typical of mini-mart type places).

Beware - on nice days they will go through some things early. Don't wait until the last minute. 

They do let you call and make orders, which is nice if you want to guarantee something will be in.

A wonderful place. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Great local business!  I love their meat selection - always great cuts, and fresh!  They also carry wines, including a featured wine that changes regularly, and is a reasonably-priced treat!  I stop there on the way home from work for items like cereal, milk, and snacks.  Certain items (like these, or the frozen products and soft drinks) I find a bit overpriced, but I understand that they are a local business who specializes in meat."}
{"text":"They really deserve a 2.49 so I rounded down.  If you're not concerned with a local business buying from UW Provisions instead of local farmers, I will admit Ken's is very popular and they keep a nice fresh case of meat albeit with limited selection. However, I'd be a little frightened to see one of the chickens from whence came their boneless breasts.  One half weighs three quarters of a pound, which worries me a little. 

Look, I buy from them, I wish they'd become an actual BUTCHER SHOP vs a MEAT MARKET, and while the high school kids who work there are nice, they're not going to butterfly a whole chicken for you so hope one of the managers or the owner is there, or answer a question about just how long that cut of steak should live over coals.  And I admit my biggest pet complaint is that I have requested some kind of ground poultry (eg turkey) be carried fresh.  I don't think that's unreasonable in 2013.  The owner responded to my request with a simple \"no.\"  

Ok.  I still shop there for some things, so clearly it's not a deal-breaker.  Not my shop, but I would bet heavily that a freshly ground turkey or chicken would move.  Just saying.

I'll end on a high note.  They have great steaks, great beef and pork all around,  Try a pork griller over live goals, indirect heat.  Man.  Their bacon wrapped pork filets are terrific, too.  And the chuck makes a damn fine burger.  Oh, bonus, they carry a tempting selection of sweet treats, including chocolates, bakery, etc."}
{"text":"This is a rarity if I'm being perfectly honest. It's a Mom and Pop styled meat store that has a certain feel about it you just can't place. A certain home like feeling you don't get at bigger chains and stores. I walked in to buy a sandwich and ended up leaving with not only a pleasant experience, but a smile on my face. It's rare to see smaller stores nowadays and this was simply a great place to go. So why not the 5 stars you may ask? The one and only short coming of this little store is some of the prices. They're not ridiculously priced like some other small stores I've seen, but they definitely have a price hike on some of the meat. One could argue that the quality of meat is better but after further investigation found that the meat is trucked in from another company. Obviously this isn't a big deal because the meat has to come from somewhere! Overall if you don't like giving your cash to these bigger corporations, these guy are definitely the way to go if you're willing and ok to spend a little more."}
{"text":"Only been there once and been wanting go back again soon. We used to go to that side of town once a month and I would wonder about this place with my husband's name. So one day, stopped there to see if they have anything quick to eat. Fresh sandwiches were great....made the way we wanted. The place was clean and very friendly. Too bad,found it after I no longer live on that side of town."}
{"text":"Great place to go for cookouts. Nice thick steaks and awesome pinwheels! Fast and friendly service."}
{"text":"Just down the road from us.  Ken's has a great meat case and I stop by periodically for deli sandwiches.  I always receive a friendly greeting when I walk in the door."}
{"text":"The best meat market in Madison. It has great gresh chicken brests. Get the burgundy marinaded steak. Check it out."}
{"text":"If you love steak, you'll love Ken's.  I take that back.  If you love meat PERIOD, you'll love Ken's.  They have the best steaks ever, and the chicken breasts are huge.  Their brats are really good, as are the rubbed pork grillers.
They have a variety of other picnic staples like potato salads and macaroni salads and some produce.  Then, add to all that, they have a convenience store attached so you can buy some pop or beer or whatever.

My personal favorites are the burgandy pepper steaks.  It just doesn't get any better."}
{"text":"I like Ken's. The store is so close to my house I can walk to it, and they have grocery staples, priced only slightly higher than the grocery store so it's helpful when I need to grab something quickly. Their meat case has a great selection. Anytime I buy something from the meat case and succeed in not burning it, I am impressed. 

My favorite item continues to be the burgundy steak sirloin. In the summer, we grill these, and in the winter, we put them in the oven at 400 for exactly 20 minutes. My kid really enjoys their cheddar wurst, which can really come in handy if you're suffering from lack of salt in your diet. 

They've got a decent selection of beer, wine, cheese and other local accoutrements which, again, is really handy since they're right down the street.

I don't really care for any of the items in the prepared meat case. They usually have ribs, cooked chicken and various side dishes (potato salad, pasta salad) in this case, and while none of these prepared items is particularly *good,* they are all adequate and helpful if you're looking for some extra calories to go with your meat."}
{"text":"Overall I was unimpressed.   Nothing really that exciting here.   I am looking elsewhere.  
For those who are concerned about where their meat comes from you should be aware that their chicken is inexpensive but it is from Gold n Plump and Purdue.   I don't know where their beef is from.
The shop is nice but much smaller than I expected.  About half being a regular convenience store.   The meats are nicely displayed and they are well staffed."}
{"text":"I stop here for the meats and fresh made sandwiches. It is a convenience store with a very nice meat case. There are reviews on here complaining that they don't have an actual butcher shop. There are not that many around anymore so deal with it or butcher your own. Burgundy Pepper Steaks are marvelous. I tried to marinate my own, but have not been able to match these. Reasonable prices."}
{"text":"Slightly weird smell when you walk. This isn't Jenny Street Market in terms of quality products, but the staff are friendly and they have a good variety of products. It is easy in and out, which makes it worth the stop."}
{"text":"Picked up a t-bone the other day.  Just some salt and pepper then onto a 600 degree grill.... 1 of THE best steaks I've ever had.   Can't wait for my next one."}
{"text":"We stopped at Ken's to pick up some top sirloin and some mushrooms for dinner. I threw together a Thai crunch salad as a tasty side. Ken's had a nice variety of meats (beef, pork and chicken) to choose from and a long cooler stocked full of vegetables and possible deli sides. They have a small grocery store selection to get anything that you may need to grill out. Their staff is super knowledgeable about their meats and meat preparation. They can help you select what you will need for a certain recipe. This is really nice to have when you may be uncertain about the different cuts of meat and cooking times. They were able to help us decide on marinades, etc too. If you don't see something in the store, just ask one of their helpful employees. I have been going to Ken's for quality meats for a long time. I have never been disappointed."}
{"text":"Ken's and I go way back. Way back. I used to romanticize those sugar cookies like nobody's business on hot summer days. But now that I am a *little* bit older I have found Ken's to have some great items of interest.

As many before myself have mentioned their meat case is good. Is it free-range, organic, named Penny, and have an interest in wildflowers...I doubt it. But you can still find classic pieces at great prices. It really is perfect if you are running to a cookout from work and really don't have the time to make something yourself. The burgundy pepper steaks grill up amazing! 

They also have a good variety of pasta salad and sides and go early in the day if possible as once people realize that the weather is good enough to grill out - they sell out quick.

One of my more favorite discoveries are they're \"to-go\" slices of dessert. They have many varieties but my go to is always Tiramisu. Try finding a better slice of ready to rock Tiramisu in the area for $5...I really want to try some of the other ones - that double chocolate one always calls to me...These cakes easily serve 2-3 for dessert. 

This store really manages to pack a lot into a relatively small space. Prices are definitely on target for what you get (expect a markup for dry goods/typical grocery store items) but they have a good turnover and everything that I have had here has been ridiculously fresh."}
{"text":"Ken's is a very wisconsin-y joint that feels like the northwoods, not the suburbs of Madison.  

The place is a butcher+bakery mated with a quickie mart and offers a concise lesson of wisconsin food products.  They carry (just about) every flavor of babcock ice cream, fresh curds, fresh baked berry pies, famous daves bbq sauce, ....  They also have a very-loaded meat counter with their own (amazing) Sheboygan Brats and cheesewursts.    Meat prices are very reasonable.

I stumbled in one day looking for ham. I left with ham, and brats, and berry pie, and 1/2 pound chicken noodle casserole.  The food-counter lady was very nice as I added .. and added to my order.  I devoured it all."}
{"text":"I'm biased here because we used to live by an amazing butcher shop that had a huge selection of fresh meat.  So I entered the store hoping for a new favorite.

The set up of this store is great.  To the left is a great selection of wine and random store necessities you may want.  (Ice cream perhaps?)  when you walk to the right you pass by some very fresh looking produce to the meat section.  While everything looked very fresh, the prices were decent in the 4-6 dollar per pound range I just didn't see the selection that I'd hoped for.  

The service was exceptional as customers were being helped immediately upon reaching the counter.  I saw the same with the deli section, though didn't try them.  The sliced deli meat would make some great sandwiches, and there are loads of fresh buns to serve with any of the meats you choose.

I'm going to assume the Sheboygan brats are good based on other reviews and my youngest was pretty thrilled over the container of cotton candy we let her get.  What's there looks like high quality.  I hope they experiment more soon with some new flavors and choices."}
