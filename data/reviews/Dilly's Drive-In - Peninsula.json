{"text":"Cheap, fast and did I mention cheap? This place is great, you sit in your car, turns headlights on for service and someone takes your order at your window.  Servers seem to be high-school aged.. they are fast, but they oftentimes forget simple things. I had to keep calling them over for extra napkins and condiments, because they would only bring out half of what I needed.  Otherwise, the food was exceptional.  I got a TRIPLE cheeseburger (don't judge) for $4! I highly recommend."}
{"text":"Went to Delly's for the first time to try them out. Absolutely fantastic double cheeseburger strawberry milkshake and fries done to perfection. I also saw my wonderful niece Lindsey working there. I would highly recommend Dilly's for your next dining adventure."}
{"text":"I stopped in here before a concert. I was really hoping for diner like drive in fast food.  But that's not really what i got. The service was great. Very friendly and helpful. As well as quick. The menu is well rounded and has a good variety. The prices are extremely low. But honestly I don't find that to be a good thing. We ordered the Thursday special of 12 boneless wings. An order of onion rings and a double cheese burger. The boneless chicken wings looked good but were so deceiving. The inside didn't resemble chicken. These are like the low quality chicken nuggets in the freezer section of the grocery store. The onion rings were honestly the same. The burger was good. I love the vibe of this place. Love the service. But I would rather pay more for better quality than to pay less for poor quality. That's just how i feel about it."}
{"text":"I've been to Dilly's several times because the Cuyahoga Falls location is near my home. I've always thought it was good but sort of had the impression that is was just a rip-off of Swenson's. Today I visited the new Swenson's on Cedar Rd and it was awful. Had the Gally Boy and it was dry and flavorless. I now realize that Dilly's is far better. Maybe Swenson's just stopped trying and Dilly's tries very hard? I hope the owner of Dilly's works on his marketing and advertising because so many people don't even know they are in town. The food is much better than the competition!! Keep up the good work and to all the Dilly's fans, SPREAD THE WORD!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I tried Dillys a few weeks back. I called ahead to order and my order was ready when I got there. I will say I was slightly disappointed with some of the items. The menu mentioned jumbo mozzarella sticks, and they were nothing of the sort. Still get a decent sized portion but menu description was deceiving. Burger and fries were good...nothing special."}
{"text":"Good, pretty fast, and very friendly.  Got the fries and double cheeseburger.  Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Service was fast and friendly. 
Typical drive up burger place. 
Food was as expected. Kids enjoyed it. 
Had Dilly Burgers, double cheese burgers and regular cheese burgers, fries, tater tots, peanut butter milk shake and cherry lemonade."}
