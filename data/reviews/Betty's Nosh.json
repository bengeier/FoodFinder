{"text":"I want to love this place but hate it because they have the worst service....if it's not waiting forever for your food than its waiting forever for a server to get you a drink!!!!! I have heard horror stories about upper management too!!!! I suggest spending your money somewhere else."}
{"text":"Every now and again you go to a place where you feel like the staff just plain doesn't care.  Waited for 15 min for silverware to eat our first course while another server told us his life story and didn't realize we had food on the table and no way to eat it.......food was sub par and honestly didn't reflect the menu description at all....really want this place to be great because I can ride my bike there and eat and drink with my family(pay attention management) but until they care, no one will care to return for a second go...even though they want to....."}
{"text":"For the West Valley is not a bad place to go. They have decent happy hour, and the place is nice and cozy. We love sitting by their fireplace..it's nice that they have a singer on Saturday night..we will go back!"}
{"text":"Took wife here for her birthday.  We both had Alfredo with mushrooms; I added the chicken.  Very good.   Good server, also."}
{"text":"Great place to grab a girlfriend and go for a leisurely lunch!  Yummy food and they don't rush you out!!  Parking can be a bit tricky due to the Paradise Bakery nearby but if you aim to park a bit south of Betty's you'll have no trouble at all!!"}
{"text":"This was our first time here and we were quite impressed!  The atmosphere was unique (high top, nice looking tables in the bar, a bar you could sit at, tables of various sizes throughout, a couple booths and a separate, glassed in room for dining).  People of all styles would feel comfortable here.  The menu is quite large and was overwhelming until our AWESOME waiter explained everything to us.  The food was great and there are quite a few more items on the menu that we would like to try.  What made the entire meal was our server James.  He knew his stuff!  He suggested some wines; some we liked, some we didn't.  The ones we didn't like he took back and suggested another glass.  We never waited on anything and he kept us in the loop about the status of all the different small plates we ordered (there was 6 of us)  The idea of a mushroom bar is unique in itself.  I like how you can pick one large or 3 smaller mushrooms.  The choice of toppings is incredible!  I gave this restaurant only 4 stars because we were only there once.  Even though we don't live close, we will be back and I would think the # of stars would raise to 5.  Especially if we get James as our server again."}
{"text":"Restaurant week fail. Very disappointing. Wine was good, stuffed mushrooms good. Steak was horrible, dry, flavorless. Only one of the 3 tacos in the taco platter had any flavor. We left most of our food on the plate and the waitress couldn't understand why we didn't want a to go box. I said because it isn't very good. She looked shocked.  That brings me to the service, in short it was substandard as well. From the hostess who barely acknowledged us, to the waitress.  I asked the waitress about the gluten free options and she looked clueless. We had to just Sit there another 15 minutes while she tried to find someone to answer my question.  I was asking the waitress another question at one point and she walked away, she seemed to be in a daze."}
{"text":"Couldn't wait to try this new restaurant. My friend and I first ordered a crab stuffed portabello mushroom -- delicious and rich. Our big disappointment came with the Betty's signature salad, which contained mixed greens, candied nuts, pears and gorgonzola. The pears were canned! To me, a restaurant serving pears from a can is unacceptable. I really wanted to like this place, but doubt I will go back."}
{"text":"Really a split plate charge at lunch??? Especially when we also had wine and a martini?  Do you really need the extra $3.00??? I don't need it, but as a matter of principle I think it's ridiculous that you charged us that."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch.  Had seen the sign for the place on the freeway and wanted to give it a try.  It took about 5 minutes before anyone came to the front to seat us.  Waitress got us water and then waited for her to come back and take our order.  Not sure how long it took, but it seemed longer than it should have taken.  My friend ordered their mac and cheese.  It was $5 and looked to be about 10oz worth.  The cheese sauce was rather light and weak on flavor.  I ordered their American cheeseburger and a coke.  They only had coke in 8.5 ounce metal bottles at $1.50.  No free refills.  Strange, since they seemed to have a bar area.  The burger was $11 and 1/2 pound, with fries.  I found the fries to be outstanding.  They were the show string type, The burger was OK, but seemed small for 1/2 pound.  Must have been shrinkage from cooking.  The American cheese had a strange flavor to it.    Overall, the fries were the only good point for us.  I thought the service was so-so and the prices high for what they provided.  Someone mentioned it seemed to be a 50-60 year old crowd.  I found it to be more a 30-40 year old crowd.  One older couple came in while we were there, sat down and reviewed the menu and then got up and left.  Someone also mentioned there were no kids.  There was one there while we were there.  ...Young boy, but his mother had him well behaved.    No plans to return.  I suspect others may enjoy the place, but it is not for me."}
{"text":"Betty's Nosh is one of my favorite places in the West Valley.  Its conveniently located, has great food (especially the mushrooms, flatbread and salad), and great wines and beers.  The live music is very good.  I also try to stop by when they have tastings so I can try new wines.  Their citrus vinaigrette salad dressing is so good, I almost don't need the salad!  The atmosphere is very cozy inside and out, any time during the year."}
{"text":"Was there last night with group of 21 women, and Brian was our waiter and did a wonderful, amazing job.  Food was soo good!  Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I'm an independent equipment repair technician and I travel all over the valley to do repairs at literally hundreds of restaurants, needless to say I frequently have meals if timing permits.    I just want to say, I've never eaten at Betty's Nosh and I'm sad to say that I have shorted myself!  The meal was way past amazing and the staff was absolutely attentive and on point throughout my stay!  The atmosphere was beyond satisfactory and pleasantly uplifting.   I had the shrimp scampi. I will never be able to get over the size of the shrimp, they were massive! The pasta was divine the male was flavorful, very eye appealing and timely.   I will most definitely return to taste and see what else Betty's Nosh has to offer from their menu, only I will bring friends!   Thanks so much Chef Chris, Dee and staff for an impressive dining experience!"}
{"text":"We love Betty's Nosh.  The breakfast is our favorite, although we did try the lunch menu one time.  We really enjoy the outside eating area.  The breakfast sandwiches and coffees are a great price and they taste fantastic.  Haven't checked out the mushroom bar or the noshing part of it because really, why do I want to spend a bunch for small portions?  I don't but I'm sure it tastes fine too."}
{"text":"Great place and good food. Staff were very accommodating when a group of us watched The Oscars. The spinach and artichoke wontons were yummy! I'll be returning"}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time 2 weeks ago. Horrible service, waited forever for drinks and food. Plus order was wrong! Asked for bread because we were starving.....never arrived. Ordered a buffalo chicken mushroon on a portabello, it was the size of a quarter!! Complained to our waitress and she says they can't control the size of the portobello mushrooms and walked away.  Talk about horrible service and this place was not that busy! She never brought our last round of drinks either.  Bad experience and will never go back. $80 tab for 2 people so not worth it!! :("}
{"text":"We have been here before and revisited, we had the worst service EVER! In fact we had NO service! Out side of the owner bringing us water, we never Were even acknowledged.  The place was not busy, there were  only two other tables Occupied (not counting the bar area) the waiter passed by us a number of times,  Never even said hello or what TF..... We left and had plenty of yummy appetizers  And wine @ Babbo's. They will have to drain all of there savings to survive with That customer service!"}
{"text":"The stuffed crab mushroom had Imitation crab meat, melted cheese and a mushroom; poor quality with no creativity. Thai chicken mushroom tasted plain with melted peanut butter, plain sliced chicken and sesame seeds, it lacked a Thai essence. Both choices in my opinion were awful!! They could have added better ingredients, some seasoning and the little mushrooms would have been well worth it. Also  8 bucks for a 6-8oz margarita that is full of ice...? Good concept bad execution."}
{"text":"We came here because it was recommended on a TV show. We are so disappointed!!  I can't even begin to tell you how SLOOOOOW the food and drinks were to come out. The Mojito was horrible. Way too much lime juice. I ordered the three mushroom plate. Why do the stuffings all need to be the same ?  Why couldn't I try 3 different ones?  Stupid rule that just cost you a returning customer. Bread pudding was burnt on one side and came with very little caramel sauce. Salmon was dry. SO disappointed in the entire experience. We won't be back."}
{"text":"Great place! The staff was really friendly, first time in so  they explained everything. Really awesome decor, and great drinks. The patio is a great place to hang out, and it looks like they have space for private functions, will keep that in mind for for work meetings. Had the stuffed crab mushrooms and it was sooo good! Good job!"}
{"text":"Met the wife Friday evening after work.  Noisy atmosphere since they seated us right in front of the pick up counter of the kitchen but everything we ordered was absolutely delicious. Started with the mushroom sampler which is 2 each of 4 different types of stuffed mushrooms. They were all fantastic but I think my favorite was the spinach and artichoke. If you don't like mushrooms you'll still be fine I had the Mahi tacos and wife ordered the chicken Sonoma.  So much flavor in everything and each fish was cooked to perfection. We definitely will be back.  4 stars was for the noise only but next time we'll sit someplace far away from the kitchen."}
{"text":"It has changed for the worst. I will not be back. New mgr needs to fire his nephew cook. Had the gus gus forgot the arugula. Bruchetta he may want to drain tomatoes  before, unless you like soggy toast, fried (ok) burned mushrooms with a bland  ranch dressing. 2 french dip sandwiches both people said less meat and fewer fries. I got the steak ordered medium rare. A half notch between raw and rare. No seasoning, bland and chewey. Oh yeah there was supposed to be seasoned butter on the steak,  it was missing, I guess the place was to busy. I am Kidding we were party of  3 and there at 6pm. there were two, two tops.they hadn't ordered yet.  It stunk. We used up gift card we do not have to return."}
{"text":"Love this place!  Very yummy and great service.  I don't eat mushrooms but there is lots to choose from.  Haven't tried their breakfast service but have dined here for lunch and dinner before."}
{"text":"Went here again for the 4th time and yet again we had a great experience. I had a party of 18 and we sat in the private dining area which I was able to reserve with no problem the day before. Beautiful decor and higher scale dining. Our server was Bryan and he was great. We are hooked on the mushrooms and cannelloni. They are a tiny bit pricy even for the happy hour so I wouldn't go unless it was happy hour. I visited the bar and they didn't know how to make a drink I requested but looked it up and made it perfectly! I absolutely love this place and will return again. And again. And again."}
{"text":"This place was amazing! We can for breakfast on a Saturday it was nice and cozy. It was like an upscale diner but the prices on the menu were very reasonable. My husband got the omelete and potatoes(which we amazing!). I got a ham,egg, and cheese sandwhich! Everything was delicious. I want to come back and try the mushroom bar at night though!"}
{"text":"My first time here and I loved it!  I ordered the Spinach Florentine mushrooms and they were very delicious.  My main entrée  was the Gus  Gus flatbread-the prosciutto was awesome. For dessert I ordered the Banana Baileys Mousse-highly recommend!  The atmosphere was great and the service was fantastic.  We were greeted by the general manager Dee James,  who was very hospitable! Thank you Dee! By the way their patio is pet friendly!"}
{"text":"I work in the restaurant business and I have extremely high expectations when dining out, that being said..... I loved this place! The food was delicious, decor and ambiance were a 10! I came in as a guest with a party of roughly 25 ladies and the service was amazing! I will be back for sure."}
{"text":"So I will go ahead and agree with many of the reviewers who report the angry shrimp shroom as one of the best. Make sure you add that one to your inventory of fungus you will be containing when you go here.  Certainly not a place for a cheap date night,  but honestly the food is superb.  The bartender had a heavy hand that Sat eve as the jack & diets were robust! We also had the bruschetta and cheese and meat board along with other delicious shrooms, though the enraged crustaceans were by far the table favorites! Good little bad fish!"}
{"text":"This used to be a 5 star place until Chef Ray R. Left. Oh we miss him. Dear management, please bring him back (if at all possible). Otherwise I love this place."}
{"text":"Horrible service, horribly managed, owner Phil Denaro demands inappropriate things from the women staff. Hair in food and rats in the bathroom!!! STAY AWAY!!!! This place is a waste of your time.. My pull be lucky if you get a drink within the first 30 minutes you are there."}
{"text":"This place is a great addition to the neighborhood. The atmosphere is really nice. Food is great. Servers are nice. Bartenders are friendly. This is a great place for a date night or just a drink after work. Cudos!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Great food, fun atmosphere, fun/friendly staff! Everything on the menu is good and unique! Nice bar that opens up into the patio.  Love it!"}
{"text":"I've been to Betty's Nosh a few times, just for breakfast on Sunday mornings. Basically I was following Chef Ray because he makes a great Omelet. The first time I went, we all stood in line while he cooked, I liked that along with the chit chat between the Chef and I. It's probably better now, we sit down and our order is taken. Ray is out front and you can watch him prepare the Omelets but some of the fun is missing. There is a down side to standing in line, that is the Omelets are great and if you weren't there early the line for Chef Rays Omelets got pretty long and you spent a long time standing.  I was very happy for Ray opening Betty's Nosh; I wasn't familiar with the partners.  Betty's Nosh, feels very open, while having well defined areas inside and out, I find the decor very pleasing, comfortable, and although I've only been there in the morning, I think that is my loss.  The Mushroom bar looks very tempting, along with the full bar, outside dinning, and the cozy fire place, it looks like a very pleasant place to relax in the evening,  Betts's Nosh's lay out will easily accommodate business lunch groups, and even more so, celebrations while groups of friends can have a nice get together. Betty's Nosh is very comfortable; I'd say there is a kind of joyfulness that permeates the place; it comes across through Chef Ray. I do have to agree with other reviews, that the wait staff seems a bit indifferent, and I've been apologized to \"for the wait\" every time, I've been there.  Waiting for the check one time, (I do like to eat and run), the last time we sat, waiting for the wonderful Omelet and side Scalloped Potatoes, Yum! My wife only orders it so I can have more. Only to find that 30 minutes later, the waiter, had just remembered that he needed to place the order at Ray's Chef Station. I've liked everyone on the staff that I've dealt with but they seem preoccupied or disorganized somehow. Ray, his Omelets, the feel of the place makes me want to go, but the wait, makes me hesitate. I want this place to succeed and I ache for Ray that enthusiasm and professionalism is missing in the front, I wish more of it would rub off on them."}
{"text":"Best brunch by far in Northwest Glendale. Always searching for a good spot in this area and found this one. Staff was great, food was good. Like the atmosphere . Plan on trying them for wine tasting And dinner soon"}
{"text":"If I could give negative stars, I would! This place is terrible. The only good thing about it is the decor (it is quite cute inside).   The first time my friend and I came here, everything was fine. I ordered the fish tacos and they were yummy! Then my husband and I came here a couple weeks later. We ordered a veggie sandwich and the fish tacos to share. The tacos tasted kind of bland, but that's far from the worst part. When I bit into the sandwich, I looked down at the bread and noticed a spot. Upon closer examination, I saw that the bread was MOLDY. Really?!! I pushed the plate aside and refused to eat any of it. The manager came over and apologized profusely. She assured us this has never happened before. I saw her walk over to the kitchen and tell the cook that the bread was moldy and to throw it away. I saw him shrug and tell her it was the last piece in that bag. The manager tried to smooth things over and gave us a gift card.   I wasn't planning on returning, but a few months later, we were driving past and figured, why not? (Let's say I was talked into it...) Our waitress was doubling up as the hostess. She was less than personable, didn't smile and barely spoke as she sat us. She threw the menus down on the table before we even reached it and walked away to chat with the other waitresses standing nearby. Anyway, I ordered the fish tacos and my husband ordered the club. The tacos were bland again. We also got dessert (some orange/chocolate thing they had as a special for Restaurant Week, which was pretty good). A few hours later, I started to have really sharp abdominal pain. It was followed by heartburn and nausea until I ended up vomiting later that night.   Suffice it to say, we are NEVER going back here. Safe yourself a bout of food poisoning and go somewhere else!"}
{"text":"Went here for Restaurant Week and it was a complete FAIL!! The menu wasn't very exciting and the service was lacking too. My husband steak was very tough and my chicken was dry and plain. The only thing decent was the dessert and wine. After this visit I don't even think we'll be back. That's to bad because my husband likes mushrooms a lot! I will have to say though, the decor is very neat and classy looking."}
{"text":"I have enjoyed Betty's Nosh a few times earlier this summer.  The mushrooms were delish! Went back twice, the last week.  Both times a huge disappointment, if you are gonna pay 8 bucks for 2 mushrooms you better have some awesome service.  Mushrooms were ok, service horrible.  Always want local places to make it and support them, this one needs to get their act together."}
{"text":"The food was ok but, when it came time to pay with the gift card we had received as a wedding gift, we asked if we could leave the balance of the card as a tip (22%) & were told no...which was just fine, what wasn't fine was being told that we didn't have to pay for the meal anyway, that it was free to us.  Free? A $60 gift card was viewed as a free meal to their customers?  Our friends went out of their way to buy us a BNosh gift card because it was where we went on our first date, they spent their hard earned money & it was viewed as our eating for free?  It was one of the most degrading statements I've ever heard from a restaurant & we were treated as indigents.  We were so disappointed, we will never return."}
{"text":"I have been to Betty's twice now. We love the location and it just has a good over all feel. If you are dining inside or out it is very comfortable I cant wait till it is cooler so we can sit next to the fireplace. As for the food, it is outstanding and at a fair price. They have assemble a great team here from the chief  to the wine stewart. Looking forward to the soon to be released expanded menu. You have to save room for the bread pudding it is truly amazing"}
{"text":"Betty's Nosh is not closed, but under new ownership.  The excellent mushroom bar and mushrooms have been eliminated, so it is just another of the hundreds of mediocre restaurants in the valley."}
{"text":"My husband and I were looking forward to trying this restaurant as it's one of the few non-chain restaurants in the area.  Our first time we tried the omelette bar which was good enough, but the fillings could be more imaginative.  We had to ask if they had potatoes, which they did, but didn't have a menu stating it.  The omelette took up a whole small plate which was a bit messy to eat. The potatoes were lukewarm.  It took forever to get our coffee.  We asked for bread and they didn't have any on the menu.   We also had to ask for utensils etc. etc.  It was extremely unorganized.  We decided to give it another try a month later and it was not any better.  We were seated and few minutes later asked to move because other people were already seated at that table.  We got up to order our omelettes and when we got back there were again no utensils and we had to ask for them.  I asked if we could get a bagel and English muffin to go along with our omelettes. The waitress said she could get them from the front.    She finally came back at the end of our meal with the check and I mentioned that we had ordered a bagel and English muffin.  She replied \"the barista was just too busy and couldn't get them ready, but I took them off the bill\".  Too busy to toast a bagel and English muffin??!  And she didn't even come up to us before our meal ended to let us know.    This place is way too disorganized, so we will not be going back anytime soon."}
{"text":"Showed up at 6:55 on Sunday big sign says Pasta Sunday 2-8pm. As I entered we were told the kitchen closes in 5min so we cant order anything.  Might be good but I will never know you wont see me back.  And the waiter who had a bit of an attitude about the whole thing."}
{"text":"My husband, son and I went to Betty's Nosh to support our local businesses.  The concept sounded great and we were excited to check it out.  The restaurant concept is indeed cool and well put together.  We ordered the Italian marinara mushrooms, macaroni and cheese and the orange roughy with lobster sauce (no lobster to be found).  The mushrooms were good, not fantastic.  The orange roughy was quite tasty.  The macaroni and cheese was average at best.  The truly disappointing aspect was the service.  They were busy; however, the lack of concern over the poor service made it worse than ever.  We waited a while for our waiter to offer us drinks which he delivered readily to not offer any refills thereafter.  We finished our meal and waited an extended period of time before we saw our waiter again to ask for our check.  He readily brought our check but never returned to run our credit card for payment.  After more than 20 minutes waiting on him to return with the manager and 2 other wait staff walking past us without taking our payment, I walked up to the manager and asked her to please run our payment as we had waited for a long period of time.  She ran our payment without any apology or any statement at all.  She simply laid it down and walked away.  As I walked out the front door, I told her that I left it on the bar.  She retorted \"okay.\".  This restaurant has tons of potential; however, without an improvement in attitude of the staff and the service delivered it will struggle to stay in business which is unfortunate.    We will give it another try and hope for a much improved experience."}
{"text":"Stopped in for breakfast on a Saturday and enjoyed our omelets - hot, flavorful, yummy! Omelets are available on weekends. Also had a delicious fresh chocolate croissant - decadent! They have a full coffee bar too with lots of options. Looking forward to returning for dinner - menu looks awesome."}
{"text":"I truly wanted to like this place. The ambiance inside is great and they have decorated the restaurant beautifully. Our server was also very friendly and efficient. However, the food left much to be desired as it lacked taste and flavor. I had a salad and believe it or not, they had messed that up badly enough that I was thinking \"how the hell do you mess up a salad?!?!\" The dressing far too sweet and the salad itself had no real flavor in it (probably due to lack of seasoning, I.e. salt and pepper).  $14 for a tiny plate of nasty blandness was also ridiculous I believe. My husband also was greatly disappointed in his dish, an Alfredo pasta, as the sauce was runny/watery and, wait for it, flavorless. Our dinner was so bad that we grabbed another dinner after we left to restore some of our taste buds back to life. It's a shame when you walk out of a restaurant and all you can comment on is the wonderful decor.  Oh well, off to our next food adventure."}
{"text":"Garbage. Total garbage.  From the time we checked in at the hostess stand through service and the arrival of our cold food it was amateur hour.   The chef must not know the menu or cannot read, because we ordered the breakfast burrito with sausage and bacon and it arrived with ham and bacon. That is awesome when your 10 year old does not eat ham. The server brought out the toast at least five minutes before the food so it was cold and hard when the food came. But wait there is more!!! The hash brown potatoes were cold mooshy and void of any flavor. Food, service and the arrival process were all beyond horrible.   If I owned this disgraceful excuse for a place to eat I would think about a new career.   Did I mention this was total GARBAGE!!!!"}
{"text":"One star seems extreme, but here are my reasons, and I'm sure you will agree on my rating. Let's start with my biggest turnoff: in plain site of customers, the cook used his cell phone with his sanitary gloves on, only to handle food immediately after setting the phone down. Next biggest complaint: the restaurant was maybe a third full, and our waitress dilly dallied around, extending our dinner out an extra 30 minutes (estimation). The time before this, our waitress actually sat down at our table, talked about getting a DUI and doing drugs, and appeared to be on them as well as she would repeat her stories and ask the same questions all throughout our lunch date. Drawback three: my boyfriend and I both agreed that my veggie burger was of a texture worth getting sick over. He said toe jam. I thought cornmeal. Tasted like _____. Exactly. Nothing. He ordered the Rueben, and although he enjoyed it, he was upset with what he received for $16. He felt it was very overpriced and expected much better quality of food for that amount."}
{"text":"We really enjoy having a great little wine bar right in the neighborhood and have been there several times for their mushrooms.  Pretty cool concept and the only place I've ever been that does it like they do.  Decent wine list, but selection may be a bit thin by some standards.    Overall its a nice place to go have a cheese plate and glass of wine and enjoy live music with an adult crowd.  Check it out."}
{"text":"This is our new favorite place! The food is amazing,  and our waiter Aaron is absolutely the best. We've been here several times now, and highly recommend this restaurant. After just the first visit, Aaron greeted us by name and is always very attentive. I love the Angry Salmon, the fajitas are fabulous, and there is a wonderful selection of wines. (After speaking with the manager, we learned that Betty's Nosh is changing to \"Nosh\", but regardless,  we will keep coming here, we love everything about it)."}
{"text":"I've visited several times. Amazing food. Friendly and knowledgeable staff and just a great all around vibe."}
{"text":"The atmosphere of this place is clean and wonderful, the workers are very friendly and there is a variety of types of food you can order from. They are most known for their mushrooms, and I would recommend trying one off the menu because they are very unique."}
{"text":"Had dinner there tonight for a casual date night with the husband. We split the Mushroom Sampler ($24 for 8 shrooms) and a traditional Cannelloni with a few cocktails. The spinach artichoke and south of the border stuffings were great, but we weren't overly impressed with the shrimp or the florentine. The pasta was really good as well.   Our server, Aaron, was great - attentive, friendly, and knowledgable. The prices were a little steep on the mushroom bar I thought - I think we will head here for happy hour for drinks and apps on the nice patio space rather than paying full price for dinner"}
{"text":"My wife and I had been previously, and it was quite good. that was a couple of months ago. Today was a much different story. We came in for Sunday mid-morning breakfast. The wait as interminable. Finally, after taking our order, the server came back about 10 minutes later exclaiming, \"I'm brain dead, what did you order?\" This wasn't a 7 course gourmet fine dining meal. This was an omelet. Duh....1/2 hour later the food arrived on a 4\" saucer plate. A tad small. The home fries were rancid and cold. After sending them back, 15 minutes later, the fries came. Hot, but Greasy. Needless to say, we're not going back."}
{"text":"I've been to this place twice and both were smashing successes. First was for restaurant week where we were treated with such amazing service and great selection. The angry shrimp mushrooms were so delicious I craved them since. Went back for happy hour on the patio and had a blast with the excellent bartenders! Even got a free wine sample! I'm ready to go back again to check out their live music."}
{"text":"I have been eating here for a few years and keep coming back!  We recently hosted a wedding rehearsal dinner on the patio and I cannot say enough great things about this restaurant.  One of the managers, Dee, was extremely helpful in making our event a success.  They definitely EXCEEDED my expectations.  This restaurant can accommodate different size large parties privately.  They have a formal glass-walled room which can accommodate approximately 26 people and a patio that can seat many more.  I am always skeptical about serving large groups as the service tends to lag and food is usually cold or cafeteria quality.  In our situation, the servers were extremely attentive and the food was superb, hot, and fresh.  Several people from our group have mentioned to me that they have or plan to return to Bettys.  Many of our attendees were hesitant because they did not like mushrooms.  They were pleasantly surprised to see the vast menu of quality food.  Since our event (April 23rd), our family has been back twice and will continue to eat here.  The specials are great as well.  On Thursday night, they usually have prime rib and sometimes coupled with a lobster tail!  Great place with good people!  I highly recommend Betty's Nosh!"}
{"text":"Ok, We come here because its convenient and decent.  Have not experienced rude service but definitely slow service.  The food is decent.  They have several items on the menu that are great when they are delivered hot.  My biggest complaint is that we always get lukewarm food.  I send it back and it comes back piping hot with no complaints but by then the rest of the meal is either gone or cold.  If they could get the CS together with the kitchen it would be a better place to hang out!  We could really use a place like this to knock it out of the park here in the Arrowhead Area."}
{"text":"Love this place!  The Mushroom Bar is a unique and tastey twist on the usual lite fare. The Sampler allows you to choose your favorites and the variety gives you plenty to choose from. Plus, Betty's serves a terrific Sunday brunch!  Comfortable ambiance and the staff and service are top notch."}
{"text":"Love this place love the atmosphere. Love the food. Less 1000 island and more sauerkraut on the Reuben would be great."}
{"text":"New bartender. Way better. Good specials for happy hour also. I'm going to keep trying this place. The mushrooms are good, but they NEED to be GREAT. They are a staple of the menu.  LOVE that it is local and not a chain."}
{"text":"I was really looking forward to trying this place out.   I am going to have to agree with a lot of the earlier comments.  The food was ok at best, (I will get t that in a bit), and the service  was sub-par.  The prices were way to high for what you got.  2 mushrooms stuffed with spinach for 8 dollars?  They were not even big mushrooms.  They were average sized.   The grilled cheese was very tasty but coming in at 14.00 I felt robbed. Oh, and don't bother to split a dish or you will be charged a plating fee. That's another 3.00 just for the plate alone,  They didn't even split the food up.  I walked out of there having had one grilled cheese sandwich, 2 mushrooms and tea for 30.00.  IF the food was exquisite, I would go back but as I stated it was mediocre. I ordered the spinach florentine.  They simply put what I assume was frozen spinach in the mushroom and put a little hollandaise sauce over it.  I think it was frozen since it was soggy and I KNOW what fresh cooked spinach looks like.  They could have at least drained the spinach.  There was no seasoning to speak of on the spinach.  And the hollandaise was runny and bland as well.  For 8.00, I expect much much more.   Bottom line, I  would save my money and dine elsewhere.  I won't be going back, which is a shame because I had such high hopes for this place."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying, the food is PHENOMENAL! We were a party of 4 and ordered a variety of dishes. All were amazing!  Usually I can tolerate mediocre service but this was downright terrible.  1. We sat at 7pm and the server came by and said that Happy Hour had just ended but we could place a quick order and he'd honor the specials. We ordered drinks and then saw him scrambling for 10-15 minutes because he lost another table's credit card. Well, by the time he put in our order, the manager wouldn't honor Happy Hour prices.  2. The server forgot we ordered drinks so we waited almost 30 minutes to get a glass of wine 3. Food took 30+ min and we could see some items sitting under the heat lamps for 5+ minutes 4. We were over charged for one of the entrees and waited 10+ minutes for the server to find a manager to fix the check  Again, LOVE the food but be prepared for a long wait, unempowered servers and lack of quality service."}
{"text":"Went to Betty's Nosh Saturday with three others for lunch; don't waste your time or money unless you just want to go with friends when it gets cooler to have a drink on their beautiful patio with a fireplace.   Other than that, there's no reason to go.  Their big feature \"stuffed mushrooms\" are like a frozen Stouffer's entree (not to insult Stouffer's!) and average price is $8 for THREE small button mushrooms or ONE small portobello.  We all had iced tea (no alcohol), shared a couple mushrooms and each had a small veggie-only salad for $21 ea.  We were the only ones in the bar and after hounding us to take our order, the waitress messed up our salad orders and we didn't get them until 30-45 mins. after we were all done with the mushrooms.  Final Review:  Awesome place to put a bar in!"}
{"text":"Betty's Nosh is a trip let me tell you that;  I went in there for lunch with my girlfriend. The place looked nice when we walked in. When we were seated the waiter was nice and informed us about the mushroom bar. We decided to order a couple mushrooms (angry shrimp) and they weren't that amazing like the waiter said they would be. While eatting there was an old man who seemed to be always angry at everyone and was loud and yelled. Made the place feel trashy instantly trying to eat and hearing an old man yell no bueno. After finishing the mushrooms we were still hungry so we ordered some more food. My girlfriend  got the bettys salad and the dressing tasted sour and I got the Rubin which was alright. We were disapointed in the place so we just paid the tab which was a shocker. Charged me for 3 cokes because they are in little bottles. Wont be coming back that's for sure."}
{"text":"This is a fantastic restaurant. The mushroom concept works very well and the service was impeccable. We have lived in Arrowhead area forever, and we are so tired of corporate restaurants!  This is going to be a locals' favorite because the food is good and thr prices are right for the area. I only rate places that I feel are 5 stars..."}
{"text":"We are new to area and noticed Betty's Nosh on one of our many errand trips. We went back tonight and had a great experience. We started with the mushroom sampler platter and they were wonderful. We totally underestimated the size of the sampler but we ate every last yummy bite!  Then I had a Mediterranean salad and hubby had a ginormous club sandwich with sweet potato fries. We thoroughly enjoyed our visit and will definitely go back."}
{"text":"I did not try any of the main dishes, only sweets.  They where very very good and I would go back.  The service however was very slow.  It was not a busy day, it just seemed like my waiter was more interested in talking with the other staff members than checking on our table."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place.... But...   I flew into town to surprise my father for father's day weekend.   On Saturday night I asked the family where they would like to go for Father's day brunch and they recommended Betty's Nosh.    A quick check of Yelp showed some average reviews, but the parents had gone there and liked it... so how bad could it be right??  So I booked a reservation online for 10:30am.   When we arrived, the hostess told me that \"I was set to be sat outside... Is that ok?\"   Since it is Glendale in June and the temp was well over 100, we asked to be sat inside... Note the reservation never gave an indoor or outdoor option.   So they said they would \"move some things around\" but we had to sit at the \"high top\" tables.    I was fine with it, but my mom has a bad back/leg thing happening and she eventually agreed.  As we walked to our table, I noted a sign on the door to the outdoor patio that said \"outdoor patio closed due to heat\".   I thought this to be odd as they were just going to sit us out there....   So we order our food.... and for brunch, several of us ordered coffee.   We were told that all their creamer had \"gone bad\" and they gave us two small containers of skim milk.... Didn't really do much to their dark coffee.... But really?  You can't send someone to the store to buy cream for your Father's Day Brunch service?  In the front of the place, they have a pastry display with a latte machine.   My wife ordered a latte and we were first told essentially that nobody working knew how to work the machine.... they later changed their story to the lack of a creamer.... Again, Father's Day Brunch, they know they are out of cream yet it is beyond them to send someone to the store to buy some....  Service was SLOW.   We saw 6 or 7 employees.... all appeared to be doing something, but I only saw two actually waiting on tables.  Then the food comes.....  My mother's omelet had the wrong ingredients, she sends it back.   At the same time she noted it was \"al carte\" and ordered some has browns with her new omelet.  My father's omelet was wrong, but he ate it.  My omelet was ordered with jalapeno peppers, I didn't notice any... I still ate my omelet.   I noted (see photo) it was SWIMMING in oil.... Not just a little oil, like enough oil to over my entire plate with a 1/4 inch of oil... It was really disgusting.  My wife ordered Eggs Benedict.  It was basically just thrown on a plate... No garnish, no effort to make it look nice and the \"homemade\" English muffin wasn't toasted...a basic thing on eggs Benedict.... She eats it... doesn't send it back.  My mom's second omelet comes.... and guess what?.... wrong again... We send it back again.... but by this time we have all been done eating for quite a while... My mom ends up eating a small bowl of fruit.  As they are cleaning up our plates, the side of hash browns my mom ordered arrived, she sent it back as we were leaving....   The blueberry muffin I ordered within the first few minutes of sitting down arrived.... perhaps 40 minutes later... when we were all done eating..  Now here to their credit they did some things right:  They recognized that they had messed up my mom's meal... and they sent over the \"owner's assistant\" ... who apologized about getting the omelets wrong....  They ended up not charging us for the two omelets my mom never ate... and took a bloody Mary off the bill.   They also gave my mom a gift card for $25.00  BUT essentially they didn't do any dish right.... ingredients were missing, muffins not toasted, meals floating in oil.... They couldn't even make a latte or provide cream with coffee for a Sunday Brunch.  They missed on EVERY level.  When I mentioned this to the \"Owner's Assistant\" she seemed surprised we weren't happy with the food that did come.   I even told her about the excessive oil and she told me they had an \"experienced omelet chef\".  I will come back as it appears they do care... I'm really hoping I caught them on a bad day.... Perhaps breakfast just isn't their thing?"}
{"text":"Good appetizer style food and brunch is decent on Sundays.  Service has been good but inconsistent.  Love the patio and live music they have frequently it seems.  Good atmosphere but also a little high priced.  Overall, good place."}
{"text":"Been here twice now. Has the cannelloni trio. It was excellent. It was a bit of all the cannelloni that they serve.  It didn't look like much of a serving but it is so rich that it will definitely fill up in no time. Their stuffed mushrooms are to die for. The only thing I didn't care for was their bruschetta. It was very plain and tasteless. Customer service was wonderful both times. Will be back gain."}
{"text":"Hey all my peeps...  I forgot to share about the live entertainment at Betty's Nosh on Saturday evening.  This is awarded Analynn's :)  The entertainment is different from week to week but very good.  I enjoyed a few drinks with the most amazing sugar free upside down pineapple cake ever!!!  I am not a breading dessert kind of person but hello, it was so delicious and warm it hit the spot good:)    The gentlemen playing the guitar was sensational and when he sang that raspy voice really had me hooked!!!  All you couples out there and family people get on out to Betty's nosh and try out the saturday evening entertainment you will not be sorry."}
{"text":"Sunday Brunch here is the best in Glendale!!  3 dollar mimosas or bloody mary all day!!"}
{"text":"This was not our first visit and will not be the last. We had Sunday Brunch here today and everything was perfect!  We sat in the covered patio area in front of the outdoor fireplace. We ordered $3 Mimosas and some excellent brewed coffee.   My husband had the Salmon Benedict and I had the Waffle Plate. We both got scalloped potatoes as the side and they were delicious, although I added a little more salt to mine. The scrambled eggs were fluffy and although my hello cheddar cheese topper wasn't melted, it was still delicious. The waffle was fluffy and moist. The bacon was cooked perfectly and everything was a great portion size.  We had so many people checking on us throughout our dining experience that I almost lost track of our server. At one point, the owner even came over to check on us and even surprised us with comping a drink.   As far as Sunday Brunch places, this is one of my favorites in the Peoria area. Occasionally, we even bring our dog with us and sit on the patio where she even gets her own water dish. This area definitely lacks dog friendly restaurant patios!  It's also one of my favorite weekend places to sit at the bar, sip a nice glass of wine, snack on some brilliantly stuffed mushrooms (though a little high on the price scale) and enjoy live music.  I can't wait until it cools down a bit more and the patio is even more inviting!"}
{"text":"So I took some time and gave you another chance and I'm certainly glad I did!  I came back with a friend and we opted for cocktails over wine (we had a rough day).  Although I was a bummed my server hadn't tried any of the cocktails yet I appreciated her honesty.  We opted for mushrooms, the mac and cheese and creme brulees for dessert.  The only thing that was strange was the cheese tray..... The cheeses showcased were american, cheddar, monterry jack, and swiss.  Where is my havarti? my gouda? but most importantly- my brie? (yuuuum).  Disappointed in the lack of imagination of the cheese tray.  Otherwise everything else was a solid choice but I had tried them all before so it was to be expected."}
{"text":"We went here for brunch since it had a decent rating and the pictures looked apetizing.  I had a spinach Benedict with the house betty's scalloped potatoes. It was a really good meal. Others ordered the omelet and the two eggs sunnyside up. Both enjoyed the Neal and plan to return for happy hour or dinner. I am really curious about the mushroom bar, next time I am in town I will give it a try. The staff was super friendly and attentive even though it was a full house. There was a great smell coming in and leaving and I need to find the item that produced it, something sweet maybe.  You will not leave hungry as the meals are big and filling."}
{"text":"This was our first time eating here and we were pleasantly surprised by the service, ambience, and quality of the food!! We will definitely be back! Very good atmosphere, wait service, and taste of food!! I'd recommend this place to anyone who loves food! The  mushrooms were magnificent, and the drinks were fabulous!! Rick, our server, was very attentive and prompt!!"}
{"text":"The food here is amazing! Also there homemade desserts are delicious especially the bread pudding!  The kitchen and service is sometimes slow but worth the wait!  Check this place out!"}
{"text":"Service took an hour and half after we got seated. No one ever checked on us to see if we wanted anything. Half of us didn't get water because they ran out of water glasses. food was cold when I got it because everyone else at table had omelets and they only had one person making omelets. Not impressed"}
{"text":"My goodness. Mushrooms are good, but here, they are GREAT!!  Hubby & I went on a date and had an analyzing time!   Happy hour on Friday until 7pm...!!!   We ate the angry shrimp, the crabmeat delight, chicken parm mushrooms & the south of the border sliders. All were great tasting, fresh, and fast served. Our service was great and the environment was good.  We will be back!!  Update- PB Cheesecake - delish. Also, did I mention how wonderful the customer service is?!  Our server (Aaron) was top notch!!"}
{"text":"was in there last night with some friends at 7:30, place was about 50% occupied. Sat at the big square table in the bar. Overall service was slow, don't know if server had to many tables, or bar was slow also server wasn't very excited about describing the food beverage prices are way high for the area even though this concept is nicely done. Mushroom bar concept is cool and food was good but some of the mushrooms were undercooked.  Overall prices are just way to high and don't see this business making it in Glendale.  I wish them luck."}
{"text":"Best mushrooms in town if you're into them. My favorite is the angry shrimp - portabella mushroom with spicy shrimp and cheese baked. The wine I like best here is the Opollo."}
{"text":"Long wait for our food. Had Reuben sandwich...the sandwich was bland with not much flavor. The best part was the potato wedges that come as the side. Had their homemade brownie dessert...which was actually very good...may try this place again but will definitely try the mushroom bar next time and not normal sandwiches."}
{"text":"The food is fantastic.  If I was only evaluating the food, it would get 5 stars, but we've been there at least 10 times and the service is always SLOW.  So be prepared to sit for a while and have a glass or two or three of wine, while you are waiting for the food.  The mushrooms are delicious. It's hard to pick a favorite, so it's best to go with a group of people and order a few types to share.  The angry shrimp, crab, and shepherds pie are three of my favorites.  But all the others are good too.  Whatever you do, save room for dessert.  The owner is a pastry chef and the desserts are fantastic.  The bananas fosters bread pudding is THE BOMB! Sooo good and made with fresh croissants.  The pistachio creme brûlée is also a must!"}
{"text":"Restaurant Week FAIL! I was so excited to try Betty's and besides the mushrooms I wouldn't return. We had looked at the RW menu beforehand and were both going to get the steak. When I was ordering the server informed us that the steak was over peppered in prep and was being sent back all night so we should get something else :( I give her credit for being honest, but the house should have substituted a different steak or something. We still payed the same amount for something we didn't want to order.  Anyway the mushrooms and wine were good. We got the angry shrimp and Italian sausage. They were both tasty and I would return for happy hour drinks and shrooms. Dinner was unmemorable and dessert was ok. I got the pineapple upside down cake and is was served cold which I didn't enjoy much, I wish it were room temp. He got the chocolate peanut butter cheesecake. Good flavor, dense and very rich, we didn't finish it.   The live music was nice, but overall not impressed with the layout or menu other than the mushrooms."}
{"text":"It could undergo a cuisine makeover. Food it just always, alright. Nothing, wowzers. Good service, nice location - above average food."}
{"text":"Went to try this place for the first time today for brunch. The food was excellent! The only downfall was the service and timing. It took over 15 minutes to even be approached by our waitress and over 45 mins - 1 hour just to have our food order put in and delivered. If they changed the service everything would be perfect!"}
{"text":"Pretty good stuffed mushrooms. Ordered the ultimate club sandwich, very delish! Polite and fast service.bi would recommend."}
{"text":"Very relaxed atmosphere.  Music is low and perfect for table conversations. Great wine and food selections. Prices are reasonable but not cheap. Happy hour is perfect on the patio."}
{"text":"I saw Betty's Nosh presented on a local show called, \"Check Please!\"  By chance I happened to be on that side of town and decided to check it out.  The place is located in a strip mall and looked quite commercial, meaning it had a \"chain restaurant\" look to it.  Which I suppose is fine, I sometimes visit chain restaurants.  The place was empty when we walked in.  Completely empty.  We were seated and given our menus.  I was very disappointed that on Sundays, they only have the lunch menu as dinner.  They offered $3.00 Bloody Marys, Bellini's or Mimosas.  I do not like sweet drinks so I ordered the Bloody Mary.  I asked if I could have it garnished with celery.  The waitress was friendly, but was unsure how to deal with a customized request.  She apologized that she usually does not work evenings and had to ask.  I mean, it was a piece of celery, but OK.   I had to use the ladies room, and I was not happy with the overall cleanliness of it.  I actually had to tell the waitress that they needed to send someone in immediately to dispose of something that was left on the floor.  OK, so now I am trying to get that out of my head as I return to the table.   I was looking at the mushroom prices and really blown away.  WAY OVERPRICED!  Should I have walked out right then?  Probably, but curiosity got the better of me. When the waitress returned with the drinks, mine was minus the celery.  OK, no big deal, my world isn't going to end if I don't have celery in my Bloody Mary.  The waitress let me know they would be bringing it to me from the kitchen.  I thanked her and thought that was nice.  Another waitress appeared with the celery, sadly presented to me, by hand, on a cocktail napkin.  OK, we couldn't use a plate?  The celery piece was not even cut, but broken off at the bottom.  Whatever........   Because we couldn't quite recall, we asked the waitress which items were featured on the \"Check Please!\" show.  She said she didn't know and she never heard of that show.  Hmmmm, as a restaurant owner, if my restaurant was featured on a T.V. show, even a local one, my wait staff would know exactly what was featured.  So, with the luxury of technology at my fingertips, I looked it up.  Because the waitress told us that the button mushrooms were REALLY small, we settled on the Portobello Mushrooms figuring if they were $4.00 more, each, they would be just the right size.  We chose the Italian sausage and the Angry Shrimp.   It was 7:00 PM and there was now only one other couple in the restaurant.  Maybe everyone was at the Mexican restaurants since it was Cinco De Mayo?  Who knows? When the dishes came out I was in shock.  WOW!  We couldn't believe what we were presented were $12.00, EACH!  The Portobello Mushroom was smaller than the diameter of an English muffin.  I looked at my guest's disappointed face and offered to buy \"second dinner\" later on since the portion size was so pitiful.  The toppings did not make up for the lack of size of the mushroom either.  A total of FOUR bites!  That's it!  Oh, and it was missing the crostini that was supposed to come with it.  We had to ask the waitress and it seemed there was confusion with the guy behind the mushroom bar, who was in full view, that although the button mushrooms came with the crostini, the Portobello didn't and there needed to be a full discussion.  Come on, it was just 2 pieces of toasted bread!  The waitress DID return with two pathetically sized, over toasted crostini.   Thank goodness too!  Four bites does not a make a meal for $12.00!  We complained to the waitress about the portion size, she defended it and stated, \"that's just the size they are\".  It would have been overpriced even at $6.00!  So in conclusion, was the food good?  Yes it was good, not great, but good.  Was the service good, yes although our waitress was often lacking knowledge, she was nice.  Was it overpriced, COMPLETELY!  I won't be back, as I just felt fleeced."}
{"text":"Very nice place, didn't even know it was there. Place next door was too crowded so we stopped in.  The place seemed very nice-upscale casual and an interesting concept.  I can count on one hand how many times I've sent food back for taste/quality.  The food lacked flavor and seasoning and was just awkward combinations.  Sent it back ordered what my wife did which was at least tolerable.  Expected to see a manager but we didn't.  Service was exceptional."}
{"text":"Breakfast was great! The coffee and tea were top quality. My wife had the omelet bar and she loved it. I had the eggs benedict and the hollandaise was sublime. All the ingredients were fresh and high quality. My only suggestion on the eggs benedict is to toast the English muffins. This way they don't get soggy from all the egg yolk and hollandaise. Our server was friendly and energetic. We are going to try dinner very soon."}
{"text":"My husband and I had been wanting to try Betty's Nosh since moving to the Arrowhead area.  We were frantically searching for a last-minute reservation for New Year's Eve, and Betty's Nosh had some availabilities so we seized our opportunity.   We were seated right away, which was great for New Year's Eve!  The bar was quite packed and there was a great band playing a good mix of music.  We were seated in the back of the restaurant, at a table that kind of felt like it was in the middle of the room where it shouldn't be, as waiters had a difficult time getting around us (my purse kept ketting smacked around when new comers would be seated). The ambiance was pretty nice, but I think the lights could have been a little dimmer.   Our waiter, Gus, was great!  Super friendly, and very attentive without being overly-so.  He gave us the prix fix menu only so we ordered from that, as we weren't very surprised they were offering a fixed menu for NYE.  However, no prices were listed at all, which I feel they should have been so you don't feel like a cheap-o when you ask.   As we waited for our food we noticed people around us being served food that was not on the fixed menu, and others being provided with the full menu.  We were both a little confused by this as we would have liked the option of seeing the full menu as well, instead of having to choose between only 3 different appetizers, main courses, and desserts.   The stuffed mushrooms were great, and I'm glad we tried those since that's what Betty's Nosh is known for!  The entrees (filet/lobster for me, prime rib/crab for my husband) was pretty good.  The desserts were ok (I got a pear napoleon and he got a strawberry banana philo type pastry), seemed like they were prepared way in advance as they were freezing cold and the pastry a little stale.    I think we would go back for a happy hour type of thing and just do drinks and mushrooms.   Overall pretty good, and we'll give it another chance!"}
{"text":"We have passed this spot a million times, and decided to finally make a plan with friends to try it out, despite the fairly mediocre reviews.  Our friends were running late, so we grabbed a table in the bar area and ordered drinks.  The adult version of the cherry limeade was strong, but rather boring.  The Man had a Kiltlifter, which they have on tap, and you can never go wrong with that!  We decided to order the happy hour special bruschetta.  Fail.  It was absolutely heaped with tomatoes... bland, light pink, unappetizing tomatoes.  The bread was borderline burned.    When will I learn to trust in the power that is Yelp and not try restaurants whose reviews aren't already stellar?  They rarely surprise, and this spot was no different.   After our appetizer, we called our friends and had them meet us elsewhere for a much better meal... with the high prices charged at Betty's you can definitely find a much better meal at a more better price.  Heed those yelp reviews, people!"}
{"text":"We went here for the Sunday Morning Breakfast meal so this review will only cover that particular meal and experience. Upon arriving the place was only about half full, but we were told to just sit and wait at an empty table until they could seat us somewhere with a server. 10 minutes went by and then we were led outside to a table in the covered patio area. It took another 15 minutes before our very busy server acknowledged us and brought us some drinks. The only thing keeping us sane was that other couples sitting near us were getting even less attention and were even more fired up about it than us.   It's a shame the service and wait was so bad because in the end the food was actually quite good. The waffle breakfast was a good value and all the food was tasty. Ordering gluten free was more of a challenge than it should have been. They don't have a gluten free menu and we weren't confident the kitchen or the GM were able to understand the restrictions (the great potato debate went on for a while) but ultimately my wife played it safe and she enjoyed her meal, sans potatos."}
{"text":"My mom and I love love love Betty's Nosh! We go there on Wednesday nights and sit by the fireplace and have wine! Our server was excellent and very friendly! The mushrooms are delicious and wine is terrific! Good pricing too!"}
{"text":"The best part of this overpriced brunch was the bloody mary. That said, it was a great place to catch up with friend but far too over priced to make a regular breakfast spot. The omelet  ($12) was fine, but I asked for grilled veggies instead of potatoes....they really should tell people it's a $6.25 up charge. I did complain & they took off $2 - still too pricey to not tell people upfront.  The server was very nice & attentive. I wish Betty's Nosh was not so overpriced & would tell people before ( for changes).  I'd give them 2.5 stars."}
{"text":"The only complaint was none of our food came out at the same time. The last to come out was the kids stuff. I couldn't it and eat infront of my hungry kids. Manager saw this and took % off my bill without me having to say anything. They were crazy busy.  that being said, loved the food, atmosphere is great. Will be going back. I love that there is a place like this in the west valley!"}
{"text":"Wow!  We were so impressed with Betty's Nosh!  Four of us went for a mom's night out and really enjoyed ourselves.  We split three of the three button mushroom plates and were more than satisfied.  We had the Beef and Blue, Tuna Salad and Panko breaded shrimp.  All three were rich, filling and just plain delicious!  We cut them all in half to make them go a little further.    Our server was amazing.  She was so sweet and attentive.  I will be heading back for a date night or another girls night out!  What a cute place...with delicious food!"}
{"text":"Just came back from lunch at Betty's Nosh. Here is the scoop: Ambience is exceptional. Bordering on new American & Nouveau European. Nice upscale decor and extremely clean. The owners were all there which is a plus. Location does not fit the place but a gem is a gem regardless of location. Food was very very good. Higher quality everything prepared with skill and knowledge. Price point is fair for the quality of food. $55.00  including gratuity for lunch for wife and I. Go for the uniqueness, food, ambience and the fact that it is not a chain."}
{"text":"I have to say that despite wanting to try the food here for a long time, I was quite disappointed.  I came during happy hour, which is M-Sa 3-7PM and all day Sunday. I am automatically suspicious of any happy hour that lasts that long. Anyway, I had originally planned to order 3 appetizers (bbq pork sliders, mushrooms, and bruschetta) off the happy hour menu. The website lists the items as $6, but the menu in the restaurant has the prices raised up to $9. I think that changing the online menu to match the restaurant's menu should be a priority in running a restaurant; otherwise, it makes me feel a little bit duped, especially since it's a 50% markup.  I ended up ordering the dinner special which included five fried jumbo shrimp, 2 hush puppies, and half a cob of corn for $15. I have to say that despite the jumbo shrimp being tasty, the rest of the meal was just ok. I just expected that if I paid $15 to dine in at a nicely decorated restaurant, my meal would be served in something other than a plastic basket with checkered grease paper. If I wanted to pay so much for fried food served in that fashion, I would have gone to a ball park or a county fair. Definitely not worth the $15 and definitely not the way a special dinner of the day should be served.  Our waitress, who I won't name, seemed a little bit awkward. I don't know if she was new or if she just didn't really know how to speak to us as customers, but it definitely got awkwardly uncomfortable at times.  Honestly, despite the fact that the restaurant is decorated beautifully, I was not impressed with the service, the food, or the cost. With so many options in the valley, I probably won't come back here."}
{"text":"I've read reviews about the slow service at this place and its TRUE!  I made reservations for brunch and my party and I waited for about 10 minutes before someone even came by to ask our name.  Our waiter was good with his service but taking some time to seat us really left a sour taste in my mouth.    Food was good, get the Scalloped Potatoes, and a spicy bloody Mary"}
{"text":"Had brunch/lunch here this past Saturday, heard of this place before and wanted to try it the last time I was in town. The places was pretty empty - actually it was empty inside but on the patio there was few diners. Since it was a nice sunny warm Saturday afternoon, we decided to just sit outside in the patio with the other customers.   So kind of interesting concept - stuffed mushrooms - you get the choice of two big button mushroom and a crostini for 8 bucks or one big portabello mushroom with the filling and a crostini for 12 bucks. I don't really like button mushrooms unless they are in my salad or sauteed on a burger so I went for the portabello mushroom with the crab meat filling. It was pretty good - not really worth 12 bucks though. My bf had the roast beef sandwich and herb red potatoes - that sandwich was pretty big - as for taste he said it was just okay and was pretty overpriced too.  Service was alright, they were kind of slow so didn't make much effort.   Overall it's pretty overpriced but it's a nice atmosphere and they do have other things on the menu if you think paying 12 dollars for a mushroom with filling is too much. Bill came out to be around 40 bucks for two people and I didn't even really feel all that full - it was my mushroom, the sandwich and one strawberry lemonade (with no refills). actually it's pretty expensive - could have buffet brunch for that price........hmmm heard that they have a Sunday Brunch with omelette - maybe that would have been better.."}
{"text":"The food was pretty good me and my girlfriend both got the waffles and eggs and the prices weren't bad but not great. It was a little hard to eat since it took about 10 minutes to get our silverware after our food arrived. I can't hold that against them though they were short staffed on a busy weekend."}
{"text":"I love that they have a bar AND a dining area- we were seated immediately. We ordered the green iced tea which was excellent, after that it did take awhile for the waitress to come back to take our order, but no worries on that front: good company and conversation. They have a happy hour for appetizers (which are extremely small for 8 dollars) we got the angry shrimp- delicious. Our food came out quickly and hot- the cannelloni trio was great. All in all the food was great the service was ok."}
{"text":"All I can say is \"WOW!\" Our food was amazing... From appetizers to entrees to desserts! Our server was Brian and he deserves some mad props for excellent service. Can't wait to come back and try more food!!!"}
{"text":"Excellent all around..Our first time here and will definitely be goin back!  Our waiter Brian was awsome!"}
{"text":"I saw these folks at Flavors of the West in Litchfield and it looked like maybe they had turned it around. So like I said last time I can get down on the mushrooms. I really want this place to get it right because I live in the north west valley and don't want to drive all the way over to Mellow Mushrooms. However it seems things have gone from bad to worse at this place. Sad. The Portobellos were now smaller than the 1st time I ate there and a LOT smaller than they were at Flavors of the West. Now I know you bring your A game and stack the deck in your favor at a rodeo like Flavors of the west but this was night and day. Same goes with the buttons. Also I noticed that the romaine seemed a little past its EXP date. Over all the food was good but for the money I am spending I expect to leave full. I don't think that is unreasonable. They have some pretty good wine and dine deals but I don't feel it's worth it. I guess for now I'm heading over to Mellow Mushroom OR next door to Oggi's for a large with extra mushrooms. Too bad for me..."}
{"text":"When trying to determine where to go in the Arrowhead area that is fun and not chain the options are limited (I guess I'm spoiled with downtown and Arcadia local options). One friend suggested Betty's. I have purposely not visited because I don't eat mushrooms and I hear that's what this place is all about. Here's my thoughts:  No wait mid-week night and the staff was prompt and nice-enough. Happily surprised to hear you could still take advantage of the mushroom 'bar' and get toasted bread instead of 'shrooms. I love me some gluten bread!   Lots of exciting selections on the sandwich menu that looked tastier so I choose the roast beef upon the recommendation of the server. I hate to say it but it was dry and annoyed I paid a hard-earned $14 for it. However, shared a great bottle of wine with friends and atmosphere was enjoyable for a few girls laughing and reminiscing.   Next time someone wants to grab food and drinks in the NW side of town I am not convinced I would go back and would rather opt to make the drive downtown to somewhere I know and love."}
{"text":"Alright.  So the food is good and Betty's Nosh is a nice cute little place for yuppie food (what I like to call \"American Gourmet\").  For where it is located it's above average.  It's creative and unique, local, and supposedly they have some live music type of things which wins points with me.   A couple things I don't like: 1) too pricey: they don't have smaller, lower priced options.  2) I'm the kind of girl who likes to know all my options.  How about a beverage menu? 3) Grammar typo on the Sunday Pasta page.  This sort of thing just irks me.  If you're over-priced and you're going for an upscale vibe, proofread your menu.    They do have $3 mimosas and bloody Mary's on the weekend.   The mushroom plates are cute.  Pretty tasty.  Nice options.  $10 per plate though."}
{"text":"A co-worker is mine recommended myself and some others visit Betty Nosh. We were seated in the patio area. The food was very good and tasty. We had the crab cakes and spinach/artichoke mushrooms as apps, very tasty and flavorful. I ordered the bbq pulled pork sandwich w/ cole slaw and sweet cinnamon sugar potato fries. The pulled pork was very good! Only draw back to the restaurant was our service/waitress. She never gave her name, but has flaming red hair. She was not personably during our dining experience and multi times I had to request wine refills or additional items b/c she DID NOT ASK! The serve who brought out our apps and meals was way more attentive and caring than our actual server, we should have tipped him!"}
{"text":"We were really excited to try this place, but were ultimately let down.  Seems sort of like a combo between a cafeteria and a bistro. I also think that it was  pricey for the actual quality of food.   We ordered the shrimp mushroom. Description said that it was \"panko\" shrimp, but it was not. We expected sizeable shrimp (since it was a 12 dollar mushroom) but instead got bread crumbs on popcorn shrimp.   For dinner I got the Orange Roughy and my husband got the Alfredo. His pasta was missing the mushrooms (strange since it is a MUSHROOM bar) and my Roughy was rough. It can't be a good thing when the black bean and mango salsa outshines the main dish... I think the fish actually made me ill, as I woke up at 1 am with some bathroom action.   The bread pudding was marginal, at best.   The beer was good.   The wait staff was very friendly but we felt like we were on our own sometimes. I think that they have to manage tables and take-outs/coffee bar.   Suffice to say we won't be back and won't be recommending."}
{"text":"To begin this is a very cute restaurant in a strip center in Glendale.  We were seated for our Saturday lunch quickly.    We ordered the mushroom sampler that comes with 4 different stuffed mushroom choices.  We had the Spinach Artichoke, the meatball,  shrimp & Shepherds Pie.  It seemed to take awhile to get the mushrooms.  I think it just takes that long to make them.  My favorite was the shrimp and the husband liked the meatball as his fav.  They all were good though.    So we ordered lunch.  The husband a Reuben & me the gourmet grilled cheese.  The grilled cheese comes with avocado, sautéed onions and 3 or 4 different kinds of cheeses & I added bacon.  Again it took a long time to get our food.  They weren't that busy.  I think they may have been understaffed, as we were there the week before for a work lunch and the service was good and I had not noticed the slowness of food delivery then.    The husband loved his sandwich.  Mine was good but a little overpowering on the cheeses for me.  I would definitely go back & have the flatbread pizza and more mushrooms!!!"}
{"text":"Betty's nosh was a wonderful surprise. The Decor is very modern, the waitstaff is superb, and the wine and mushroom bar experience was fabulous. The owner came out and shook everyone's hand and was such a delight. Such a pleasant surprise! my favorite on the mushroom sampler was the chicken Alfredo mushroom and the spinach artichoke mushroom, outstanding! Will definitely be coming back!  Updated: with change of ownership and name to Nosh, this place has gone way downhill. The food isn't as good, changed menu too."}
{"text":"Food was delicious, as usual.  Wait person (or someone) got our order messed up and one person in our party never did get their entree.  The manager was very gracious and did her best to correct the situatuion."}
{"text":"This was our third trip here.  I will not be back.  First trip was good.  It seemed slow, we were seated promptly and the service and food were good.  Second trip there, we did not have a reservation, and were told it was an hour wait.  Not having the time we left and dined elsewhere.   That leads me to last night.  We decided to try this place again, and this time with a 7 pm reservation.   We arrived at 630.  Our table wasn't ready.  No biggie, we were early so we decided to have a drink at the bar.  Bartenders were very good, and attentive.   Getting close to 7, we were surprised that no one gave us any updates and seemed to have forgotten about us.   705 and still nothing.  The bartender overheard us talking about this and decided he would check on the reservation.   He promptly came back, apologized for the confusion telling us it would be a few more minutes.   720 and we were finally seated.  Apparently there was a restaurant week special and they were busy.  We were told that our table was being used by another party that was there for 2 hours,  and that was the delay, even though we saw people being seated while we waited.  Sorry Betty's Nosh, this is not my problem.  We were underwhelmed by the food and service,  with my girlfriend not even finishing the meal because it was so distasteful.   I spent a hundred dollars there and that will be the last money I will be spending there.  If you want excellent food and service for the price, do yourself a favor and look elsewhere."}
{"text":"We made reservations days in advance and when we arrived we were told it would be another 30 minutes! However it was almost an hour before we were seated.  The service was beyond slow, and it took another 34 minutes after ordering to receive our food and when it came out it was cold! Small portions of under flavored food! I will never again set foot in this overpriced travesty. Do not waste your money or time! Run by amateurs. I predict they will not be in business much longer once word gets out how horrible they are! Let's hope they do the honorable thing and close their doors now."}
{"text":"Family went in for breakfast on a Saturday morning.   PROS +Not too many people in, so had a nice 'Governor' booth in the back (have 2 small kids) so it was perfect + Omelete was awesome..you get the choice of 4 ingredients and 2 sides, the home fries are great as well + Prices aren't bad  CONS - Service was slow for it being mostly empty - but once we had our food, service picked up...  Would recommend for a nice breakfast/brunch, without feeling cramped and rushed to eat...good for families"}
{"text":"Hubby and I thought we would try it last night.  I ordered the Angry Shrimp, and he had the southwestern portabello.  This was our fist time, and the waitress had the giggles while she talked and we had to have her repeat what she was telling us.  The Angry Shrimp was OK and my husbands Southwestern was way too salty.  When we told the waitress, she didn't offer to bring something else, nor did she apologize.  She did mention that she heard that complaint before.  I don't think we will be going back."}
{"text":"Amazing, enjoy the stuffed mushrooms...the Godfather and the Crazy Shrimp are awesome!"}
{"text":"Bad experience at Betty's this morning. Waited an hour and 15 min. after ordering before our food appeared, AFTER a party of 4 at one table and party of 2 at another, both who came in 15 or 20 min. AFTER us were served & eating. I ordered Benedict. It was one muffing one egg (cooked hard) cut in two, so I got 2 halves instead of 2 eggs.     Won't be going there again for a while"}
{"text":"I could not be more excited for a new restaurant to open near my home. This has all the makings of a great place, there is just a problem with the execution.       We had planned to try out Bettys for the 1st time for my friends 40th birthday. I called and made a reservation for 10. Well, imagine my dismay when we arrived early and their was a sign on the door they are closed for the night! WHAT!?!?! I had given them my phone number for the reservation, they couldn't call me before I arrived there with 9 friends for a birthday party!?! Not good. But, I was willing to give this place another try. We went for dinner with 8 people. We where sat immediatly at a high top table for 8. They table set up is cool because there are 2 chairs on every side of the table, so it allows couples to sit next to each other, and everyone to be involoved in the conversation. The decor is cute and hip. Now, to the service. Not good. We waited 15 mins to recieve our drinks we ordered (it was not busy) our waiter was impossible to get. Overall, poor service. I had the angus burger, and I have to say it was good. It was cooked to the perfect temperature.  The shining gem at this place is the mushroom bar, boy are they yummy! I could have ate 10!      Overall, it's ok. There are so many better options in the arrowhead area that have WAY better service."}
{"text":"1st visit. Food was really good. Took my father there and said it was the best breakfast burrito he's had. Service was non existent and a bit non communicative at tymes. I had the Yelp deal and the server kinda made me feel bad for using it, like it was going to be a big hassle taking 10% off. The manager, Dee came to our table and apologized and I was surprised that she comped our meal. She mentioned that they're going thru changes with the staff and trying to improve the service experience and she noticed what was going on and felt bad. I've been a server, I understand.  It's hard when your short staffed and it's busy. Perhaps it's the server,  perhaps it's not. I really did appreciate Dee catching all this and stepping up to solve the problem.  She turned something that could've got a lot worse into a pleasant experience with a happy ending. I definitely will be back, not only for the food, but bc of how the situation was handled and I know we all have our days!  I know there are $3 mimosas, but might I suggest a champagne bucket?"}
{"text":"I went for HH. Sat at the bar. Megan, the bartender, provided good service. The 3 Cannelloni Trio was very tasty. Well drinks were $2.50  I had a vodka cranberry and they charged me another $.50 for the cranberry!!"}
{"text":"We've been here a couple of times before but this experience left a lot to be desired. There's no Sunday dinner menu offered with the exception of a lobster special. So, it's the lunch menu for anything else. I can't get over them charging $11 for a \"Caesar\" salad which was not much more than a little romaine lettuce & dressing. DISAPPOINTING!!! Our server Aaron was great as always but the food was mediocre at the very best. We'll give them one more try... But definitely not on a Sunday."}
{"text":"The only great thing about this place is the patio. The service is totally  hit or miss. The bartender was more interested in talking to his buddies than asking us if we wanted a drink, it took him over 5 minutes with no one else there to acknowledge us. The stuffed mushrooms were very bland and I had to send them back bcuz they were luke warm. They came back nuked and soggy."}
{"text":"We've visited this place twice during our visits to Glendale and absolutely love it! Great atmosphere to have wine and dinner and the staff is friendly. They have a great menu but are known for their mushroom bar. We were just there on March 20th and enjoyed their Shrimp appetizer and the Mushroom Taster. 8 buttons and you choose 4 Flavors. It was great as usual. Alas, we were just told that Betty's Nosh is to be no more after April because they're becoming a Mexican restaurant. I guess there aren't enough Mexican restaurants in the area. I hope this isn't true but if it is, too bad!"}
{"text":"Tonight I had one of the most enjoyable dining experiences that I can remember. After reviewing the Arizona Restaurant Week website we decided on trying something new and I am so glad that we did.   Upon walking in we were greeted and offered a table of our choosing to sit at. Since this was restaurant week there was a set menu and none of courses disappointed. We began our dinner with a glass of Wine and ordered our appetizers which were stuffed mushrooms. Two of the \"crab meat delight\" and two of the \"angry shrimp\".  These stuffed mushroom were absolutely incredible!!!!  Next up we ordered their signature Mac & Cheese ( this wasn't a part of the Arizona Restaurant Week special but honestly who can say no to Mac & cheese?). The Mac & Cheese was creamy and full of flavor. For our main courses we both had the \"angry salmon\" which came with garlic mashed potatoes and vegetables. The salmon was excellent,perfectly cooked with great flavor. Salmon dishes like this one will have me choosing them over a steak any day of the week. To end our meal we had our choice of desserts which like everything else this evening didn't disappoint! We ordered their gluten free pineapple upside down cake and my new favorite the peanut butter cheesecake. The pineapple upside down cake was moist and the flavors were amazing.  Upon taking my first bite of the peanut butter cheesecake I knew I would have to come back!  For a peanut butter fanatic like me I couldn't have been more pleased. Thank you to Emily, Chris and JT for their hospitality and amazing service. We were even given a tour of their patio before leaving. This will be a new spot I will frequent!!!"}
{"text":"New owner understands customer service, quality food and restaurant business. BACK ON OUR LIST! We stopped coming because the previous owners took this from the neighborhood hang out with good food at a competitive price to poor food, high prices and no care for the customer. The new owner is revamping the menu, moving back to reasonable prices, quality customer service and a great vibe. If you haven't been in you need to. We will be coming back again!!!"}
{"text":"Everything I have ever had here was delicious.  My favorite is their bread pudding it is a must. I would come here just for their bread pudding and homemade ice cream!  Great happy hour as well  Great wait staff always super friendly!"}
{"text":"I say three stars Because I'm never impressed by the wine or liquor options and the food is mediocre.  That being said, Betty's is on my short list. The live music is always amazing when they have it and I always feel taken care of by the bar tender. There's a patio and I always have a good time despite the 3 star food."}
{"text":"This place is wonderful! I had the best bruschetta that I have ever had and the crab stuffed mushrooms were amazing! The staff was wonderful and very friendly. I will be going back here to eat often!"}
{"text":"Overrated. Very expensive for a small amount. Their mark up is unreal mediocre for  mushrooms"}
{"text":"Everything I have ever had at Betty's has been amazing. I live the food, the drinks and the service. The angry shrimp mushroom is my favorite. I also love the mushroom soup. It is THE best I have had in my life!!!'"}
{"text":"New management and a new chef.  Three stars is a positive review.   I was here during a transition time I look forward to improvements."}
{"text":"This is fast becoming a new favorite of mine.  I take dates and clients to this place.  The food is really good, the wine and bar selection is vast.  I tend to ask for Brian, he knows his stuff, makes great recommendations and seems to know the right time to check in and when to stay away."}
{"text":"Food fantastic.  Atmosphere fabulous.  Service impeccable (Brian was our waiter this visit)!"}
{"text":"The food is good and the mushroom concept unique. The atmosphere is very nice. They fail in the service department. I have been there 3 times and each time have had horrible service. Most recently we went in for lunch the other day and were \"waited on\" by Josh (I think that is his name). He was more interested in hanging out and joking around with his fellow staff than he was attending to us. He would leave for long periods of time and not even check back. There were only a handful of diners there at the time and now I know why. I will only go there again when I have plenty of time to spare. We even passed on dessert because it took him too long to come back and by that time we realized it would probably be another half hour if we even tried. I really want to like this place. They need to focus on service."}
{"text":"We've never experience such bad service ever!!!  I made a reservation for 4 on my husbands 50th birthday and that was the only positive experience we had.  When we arrived, the hostess asked us if we'd like a high-top table in the bar area next to the \"live entertainment/karoake dude.\"  We chose to sit outside by the fireplace which was warm and inviting.  It took our server at least 10 minutes to come to us and get our wine order.  When she returned with our wine (about 10 minutes later) there was no wine presentation, the person who ordered the wine was not the one asked to taste the wine and she sloppily poured it in our glasses, spilling as she went.  The wrong wine was brought out to us and when we pointed it out, she said she would remove it from our bill and never offered to bring out the correct wine!  Meanwhile, we were observing other tables who were disgraced at the service they were receiving.  We actually witnessed the owner asking other tables if they needed their water glasses because they had ran out!!!!  Really???  You're going to ask people for their water glasses back?  That was a jaw dropping experience!  At this point, things were almost becoming surreal...two of our four dishes came up and the owner brought them out to us.  As he was setting them on the table, he dropped one and the contents and plate shattered!  Part of the food went on one of our guests and onto his silk shirt.  He apologized and ran!  No one came around to clean it, bring us napkins, or anything for at least 5 minutes!  A bus boy came by and swept the contents up and we refused the one plate that survived the collision because it had plate shards in it.  In the meantime they sent some bread over but never was the problem addressed!  We all make mistakes and when we do, we should apologize and let people know what you are going to do to rectify a situation.  We had reached our boiling point and walked out.  We were there for an hour and a half and never tasted a bite of food.  We really had high hopes for this place because we love to support local non chain restaurants, but it failed in a huge way and we could never go back again.  We all worked in the restaurant industry long ago and it just takes some proper training of your employees.  They were busy that night but the attitudes of the owner/employees (except our bus boy who was working his first night) was extremely unprofessional.  We'll see if our guest will get his dry cleaning bill or shirt replacement actually paid by the owner.  We left and went down the street to a local Italian restaurant that is always yummy and consistent to make our night salvageable."}
{"text":"The food is always great here; however, I have been here several times for brunch and the service is pathetic. My family and I visited once again on Sunday for brunch and they literally brought out my toast 20 minutes before my meal. The real meal came out an hour after we arrived. Drinks 30 minutes after we arrived. I am a former server so I forgive quite a lot but this is not just a one time thing. Betty's nosh has no idea how to staff their restaurant properly during high volume hours. Either that or they have no idea how to hire. I love the food but I'm sick of spending my money here with the service. I have read a lot of reviews on here that say great service.....sign me up for that server. We have had about 10 different ones and maybe 1 was actually sufficient."}
{"text":"We went here for for breakfast and had a great experience. The mochas and breakfast sandwiches were great. We brought our twin boys who are 19 months old. While I wouldn't say that this restaurant is designed as place meant for kids, the environment and staff were very kid friendly."}
{"text":"This place is a little different.  The food is prepaird by world class chefs, but the portions are extremely small, and I mean small.  I paid $15.00 dollars for mushrooms.  They were good but come on give me a break here.  Extremely over priced.    One of the thing that I think is weird is that they have a banner hanging outside that says \"Voted best entertainment\" by owners.  Why would a business put that on their banner?"}
{"text":"So Okay....first impression from the customers....it's a place for ladies who do lunch.  1pm on a Wed, 10  customers, 9 were ladies.   Menu was ok, tho.  BUT, don't serve spicy waffle fries without saying they're spicy.  If my wife had ordered those, she'd be screamin!.  Waiter promised to tell us about the mushroom bar - he forgot.  Also forgot to bring the leftover 1//2 sandwich back to the table before we left.  Grilled cheese for $10 was pretty tasty.  Roast beef au jus was good, I'm told.  I'll maybe try the Sunday menu - looks fairly good"}
{"text":"I was so excited to see a restaurant concept like Betty's Nosh pop up on the west side of the Valley, and I was simply ecstatic that it surpassed my expectations!  My friend and I stopped by for an early weeknight dinner. The menu is changes frequently, but the night we were there they had button mushrooms with various toppings. I had three mushrooms with a warm crab and cream cheese mixture on top. Let me clarify that this is real crab and not the fake stuff with a K. This dish may sound small, but it is VERY rich.  I also got a side of mac and cheese which was pure creamy deliciousness. Our waiter was kind enough to give us each a side of Caesar salad for free. He also gave us two mini chocolate and peanut butter cupcakes for free. It was pretty slow the night we went which may explain the behavior, but it was much appreciated no matter the motivation.  I got a Long Island Iced Tea to go with my meal, and it was \"okay.\" I'll let that slide sine Betty's is much more of a restaurant rather than a bar.   I can't wait to keep checking back for new menu options!"}
{"text":"Out with my wife and a friend.  Had some great wine and appetizers. The mushrooms & sliders were very good. Our waiter was fantastic. We'll be back."}
{"text":"I have been to Betty's several times over the couple years they've been open.   My wife and I would go more often, but seating on the bar side is always an issue.  The bar side has three tables that seat six.  The rest seat 4.  They are big tables and take up a lot of room.  The bigger problem is that the ownership does not regulate how many people sit at them.  My wife and I went in the other night to meet another couple.  Live music was about to start, there was a playoff hockey game on and there was nowhere to sit on the bar side.  There was one older gentleman at the very first table by himself with 5 empty seats surrounding him.  The six top in the back has 2 older women chatting it up.  There was only one 6 top that was being used someone efficiently (4 people).  Most of the other tables only had 2 people each.  So maybe just move to the Patio right??  Despite having a nice misting system and umbrellas, IT'S CLOSED??  So we end up sitting in the dining room with no TV or entertainment..  Not a bad place if that's what you are looking for, but shouldn't be forced to sit there if there is capacity to sit where we want.    So lastly, I mention to one of the workers that if they have mostly tables for 2 and 4, more people would get to sit and the place would be more profitable..  This person said they agree, but that the ownership is not interested in suggestions and nothing will change..  Disappointing..   Ignorant ownership."}
{"text":"The food was horrible the smallest portions ever. My kids meal was 5 times bigger than mine. I couldn't even cut through my chicken. The mushroom bar was far from good the mushrooms were not cooked or seasoned in any way special they were plain chicken on top plain and tough. They had teriyaki sauce on top and the one I have at house is better. The place was dead and took forever to get food about 25playset minutes. Will not go back and would not reccomend."}
{"text":"What an adorable place! This is the first time I've heard of a wine and mushroom themed restaurant, and I am tickled by it. The ambience is upscale, and the dress code is dressed-up-dress-down. The wine and cocktail list is overflowing with options, and their mushroom menu is delightful. Imagine: a tall glass of anything you desire, and a mouthwatering, stuffed mushroom (cheese, spinach, shrimp - you name it). The service was fast and friendly. I encourage everyone to try this little gem."}
{"text":"Stop in on new years eve and was surprised to find a limited menu as there was no previous mention of this limitation. I wasn't ready to spend $40 on a single dish so I chose to order from the mushroom bar instead. Enjoyed it but would have liked to try the full menu as it had some good sounding dishes. I hope I have a chance to return."}
{"text":"Nice for a change.  Not many mushroom places around.  They have other types of food as well."}
{"text":"I really want to write a good review because I love the concept, location and fabulous cocktails but the service is consistently horrible.  Yes I know I am not giving it a good review but I do continue to return for the drink menu.  The mushrooms are just okay. The chef is a sweetie but really needs to add a little more variety to the mushroom options.  The full menu is just okay.  The menu has not changed in the 2 years I have been going.    What really is lacking is service.  I was just there last week and our waitress was in the middle of the restaurant talking to the manager while there were several tables with empty water glasses and frustrated customers.  I have written to the management with no response.  Service staff seems uninformed about the menu, untrained in customer service and have no pride in their job.  I do not blame the servers...it the is general manager. Please fix the service.  So much potential."}
{"text":"We arrived at the restaurant, We waited at host desk for some one to come to us, a server came and said restaurant was full and we could sit at the high tops in the bar. Our server was, to say the least Disconnected, seemed not to care in either her actions or attitude, we waited to order, she didn't know the menu, said no to a simple substitution on one of our orders without even checking with the kitchen ( please substitute pasta for Mashed potatoes).  Food was ok, our chicken dish has greasy sauce on the plate and the chicken sandwich was dry.  The bartender came by to help with drinks and was very personable, possibly the only redeeming feature"}
{"text":"I went here for a business dinner. It was amazing!  The food was fantastic, the service was fantastic, and even the live music was pretty great!    I had been avoiding going for a long time because I was worried about it being too expensive.  Surprisingly enough the prices were actually really reasonable!    This place is a definite must try if you are in the area! I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"If there were 2.5 stars as an option\" I would have gone with that. My family and I had reservations on a Saturday night. We were seated quickly, but at a wet table. When we asked if she could dry the table, she came back with a wet towel & continued to wipe. When we asked if she could get a dry towel, she promptly said, \"that's as good as it's going to get\".  So we simply used our napkin and asked for a new one of those. Our server had very little experience & rather than writing down our orders,  she would come back to the table with drinks, call out what it as and wait for one of us to claim it. Same with the food. The food was ok, and although my pork chops were tasty, the sautéed onions were burnt and I had to scrape them off. My mom described the chicken marsala as, only OK, and our mushrooms were greasy & small. Things were forgotten throughout the night and it made our experience less than we had hoped for. The live music was great and we did move into the bar, where we had great service. All in all, I would not make the trip back, knowing that service was off and food was mediocre. It's a shame because it is a great concept."}
{"text":"I have had a few meals at Betty's.  The latest was at a business meeting.  The applewood bacon and chicken sandwich was enormous and quite tasty.  I've also had the chicken Caesar salad (house-made dressing).  That was excellent also.  The server was fabulous.   I've tried several frappes, lattes and even plain coffee.  All were excellent and very reasonably prices.  The scones and muffins are quite flavorful. Their patio is gorgeous with plenty of room and very comfortable chairs. It seems they've gone all out with the decor as the whole restaurant is beautifully decorated. The wine bar is fun.  One can sit inside or outside. I've been told the Grenache is top notch though I've not had any yet.  They do have a couple meeting spots for those who are looking for a good west-side location. Definitely a can't miss place to visit."}
{"text":"One of my favorite spots in the area. I love the mushrooms as well as their pasta dishes. They have love music sometimes and a great happy hour. It is unique and the service is really good.they are always busy, but the wait is never long. Definitely  a weekend favorite of our family."}
{"text":"Not quite sure I totally get the whole Betty Nosh concept, although what was noteworthy was that our waiter reminded me of that guy who scored an 8-ball before his shift and just COULD NOT WAIT!  He was amped...so much so he literally cleared out his whole section by hovering incessantly over his tables, talking and interrupting and just in motion, constantly.    OK food, expensive though."}
{"text":"Had a terrible experience here. We ordered breakfast omelettes and waited over an hour. All of our orders were wrong. Food is average. Not going back."}
{"text":"Mahi mahi tacos were perfect for lunch on the patio. I wish it came with more of the mango salsa on the side. Hubby had the pulled pork and wasn't disappointed (which is saying a lot!). Service was great. I could sit at the outside bar all afternoon and just relax!"}
{"text":"My husband & I have been frequent customers here for over a year. Bartenders have always been friendly & fast. Servers were generally slow to get to you but were friendly when they did. Food was always very good. But it has all gone south as of summer 2014. Final straw was on our last visit December 14, 2014. Arrived at 12:45 pm & were told our server would be right with us. 10 minutes go by. Nobody has talked to us. Customers at next table are visited, orders taken & drinks brought. Still no server for us. I figure she is potentially our server & watch her for eye contact so we can get some service. My husband gets up & asks hostess if our server is going to help us. (He has been sitting facing the clock & has been making note of the time.) Hostess brings ice water, apologized & said our server would be right with us. 15 minutes of waiting & FINALLY Brittany shows up. My husband asked why it took so long & how it's been 15 minutes. How we had to sit & watch others get drinks & food while we were basically ignored. She tried to correct my husband by saying it was only 2 minutes & she was the one who told the hostess to bring our water. We had times from watching the clock! We are ok with waiting as long as someone at least stops by & communicates, maybe takes a drink order, comps a cup of coffee.....something! But 15 minutes? Then argues with us & tells us we are wrong?! Grudgingly she takes our order. Eventually our plates are delivered (is there spit in our food? Yes, she was that rude. You always wonder.) Sausage is dry and over cooked. Can't eat it. Potatoes are burned on the bottom & exceeding dry. Normally they are heaven but apparently they couldn't stand to take a financial loss on one burned out tray. Sad. We were hungry going in & left less hungry but pissed! Brittany should be fired & the kitchen staff retrained. $50 for this abuse? Never setting foot in here again. We will take our hard earned money somewhere else."}
{"text":"I have to admit the idea of a mushroom bar appeals to me.  I like mushrooms in particular escargot stuffed mushrooms.  Okay so they don't have escargot but they do have a lot of other stuffed mushroom items.  I ordered the Italian sausage which comes with marinara sauce and mozzarella cheese.  To be honest I thought I would get a piece of sausage but it was more like a sausage meatball.  It wasn't bad but it wasn't a Schreiner's.    Since I was at a mushroom bar, I had to try the mushroom soup. It was pretty good for the price.   The rest of the menu just didn't appeal to me.  I think I had decided on the sandwich but it wasn't a mushroom sandwich.  We had to leave sooner than expected so I never ordered.  All and all the place isn't bad, but it's not great.  The patio looks a little run down and the service is a touch slow.  The prices are pretty reasonable so if you crave a stuffed mushroom then you can't go wrong here.  Unless it's escargot stuffed mushrooms."}
{"text":"A mushroom bar has been made into a novel concept. Check this place out during happy hour from 4-7 pm to take advantage of the discounted drink and food prices. Beer is a $1 off and two button mushrooms with the same filling are just $6. Bring friends, order several items and plan on sharing.   We ordered several plates of filled mushrooms. Two button mushrooms with the same fillings come on one plate. Our order included the Angry Shrimp (sweet and spicy), Thai Chicken (with a mild peanut sauce with a bit of a kick), and Spinach Florentine (freshly cooked spinach with a tangy, melted cheese holding it together). We also ordered bruschetta, flat bread (similar to pizza), and a chocolate torte. All were delicious, though a bit pricey, especially if you weren't taking advantage of happy hour prices.  The servers were extremely energetic, cheerful, prompt and attentive to our party of eight's needs. She even divided up the bill according to our wishes.  If you use Foursquare, check in three times to take advantage of a 10% discount on the third visit. Personally I would love to return to sample the other mushroom fillings like Shepard's Pie and South of the Border."}
{"text":"My first time at Betty's Nosh was excellent my husband and I went for Sunday Brunch and couldn't decide what to order because everything looked so good! We ended up choosing the eggs benedict with home fries it was presented very appealing just how I like my food! I want to come back for dinner sometime or even Thursday wine tasting! I'm glad I found Betty's Nosh it's a very well ran / staffed restaurant  I would recommend it to anyone!"}
{"text":"I had lunch today at Betty's Nosh with three work colleagues.  The place was pretty slow and it was a nice day so we elected to sit on the patio.    Pros: Nice, breezy patio.  There was cigarette stench wafting from someone smoking outside the front doors but that's not a fair thing to hold against a place since it is out of their control. Interesting concept - I've never been to a mushroom bar before and it's a creative idea. Quality ingredients - Nothing I had tasted \"fake\" and my food seemed fresh  Cons: Service - the place was very slow but I felt we were forgotten by our server.  After she dropped off our food we didn't see her again for the longest time.  I had to go inside seeking our checks because we had to get back to work. Soft Drink Selection - I ordered a diet coke not knowing that it was going to be in an aluminum bottle.  If you're a restaurant and you don't serve fountain soda please let me know because I'd really rather have water.  Also, don't charge me $2.50 for a can of pop, it's insulting. Portions/Price - Way overpriced for the quantity & quality of food you get.  The Portions/Price issue is the worst part about Betty's Nosh and the major reason I will never be back.  I ordered the crab alfredo mushroom and it came on a side dish plate alongside a 1/3\" thick slice of baguette with a few crumbs of toasted cheese on top.  They charged $12 for my minuscule meal.  I have to say that the food was pretty good - not stellar, but solidly good .  It was also the size of a side dish or appetizer.  I could have elected to add another slice of bread \"crostini\" for $2 more to round out my meal if I wanted.    It is important to know that I don't give high ratings for large portions.  In fact, I despise when you ask someone whether a restaurant is good and they recommend it based on it having massive portions.  For example, I doubt people who rave about Claim Jumper for this reason.  I would rather have quality over quantity any day of the week but this meager fare was priced at 2x the value it should have been.  At 50% or even up to 70% of current prices and assuming you don't have somewhere to be after the meal I would recommend Betty's Nosh but for now this spot gets 2 stars for slow service and unrealistic prices."}
{"text":"I just love this place. We were referred by friends.  We live in Scottsdale.  This place is worth the drive.  The food is delicious and the atmosphere is cute. They have entertainment after 7:30. Wine list is great and service was good. It was fun sitting next to the mushroom bar and watching the cooks do their magic. Would recommend this place to all my friends!"}
{"text":"No longer Betty's Nosh ~ it's now Nosh Eatery and Wine Bar!  READ the reviews for newly named establishment under the new management!"}
{"text":"Made our first visit during restaurant week.  Opted for the button mushroom appetizer, the highlight of the meal, and fish tacos for the entree.  Everything was fresh and full of calories - delicious!  Staff was attentive and nice.  Enjoyed happy hour drinks.    Place seemed to cater to 50's / 60's crowd despite a nice bar area.  No kids could be seen in either the dining or bar area.    We made reservations for 5:30 on a Saturday night.  The place was nearly empty when we arrived.  By 6 pm the place was full except for one table (probably a no-show).  Recommend reservations for Saturday night unless you don't mind eating in the bar or prefer a late dinner."}
{"text":"The food was great. The stuffed mushrooms were yummy! The reason I am voting a 2 is because the service is horrible. We waited a good 15 minutes before we were approached for dessert/check/anything else. When I asked for a coconut macaroon (that were showcased right next to us on the bar), it took the server another 5 minutes to get me one. When I tasted it, it was very mushy and not worth the calories. The server asked me if I liked it, and when I said I didn't like it instead of apologizing she asked me if I had ever had a macaroon before. Who asks that? Then tells us, \"Well, it was only a $1.50.\"   Probably won't be going back."}
{"text":"Someone local suggested this place to a friend of mine. We met for lunch while I was in town for a short visit. We were seated right away, and our server quickly came to get our drink order. As an appetizer we tried one of their mushrooms from the mushroom bar. The angry shrimp mushroom was to die for. I had the grilled veggie sandwich for an entree. The sandwich was very tasty & filling.  Other reviewers have had issues with service. We had nothing, but great service the whole time we were there. The restaurant wasn't very busy (probably since it was lunch on a weekday). When they get busy, service may slow down."}
{"text":"2 stars for poor service and just okay food. We came here at 3pm on a Wednesday with a group of 7 and the place was pretty much empty. We stood around waiting and no one came to seat us even though we saw several waitresses standing around chatting so we eventually ended up seating ourselves. We got an assortment of mushrooms from the lunch menu and the food was just okay, nothing special. Although they have a bar, the beer selection is very limited here. I would not recommend this place nor will I be returning."}
{"text":"We tried this place out for breakfast on Sunday and decided on the omelet bar. Cute place. You are able to design your own omelet and it was good. That being said I would have liked to see some more unique choices for the omelet station. It was pretty much the typical ham, bacon, sausage, peppers, onions, tomatoes, spinach and cheese. Asparagus was the craziest it got.  We read that the creme brulee was good and tried the butterscotch one. It was delicious! 3 stars because the menu wasn't all that unique and the service was pretty poor. We waited at least 20 min to have a waitress acknowledge us and almost 30 min for our bill. We had to keep trying to catch the staff for utensils, salt and pepper, etc. Luckily since the omelet was prepared in front of you there wasn't any waiting for the food.  I'd go back and try the mushroom bar and wine list. Oh, and I'd definitely finish with the creme brulee again!"}
{"text":"Went here today for the first time for a late lunch at around 2:30. We were going to go to Paradise Bakery, and my plan was to peek a the menu and bail if it really was all mushrooms (blech, not a fan). Betty's Nosh is decorated very nicely, so that drew me in initially (Dyson air blade in the bathroom...love those!) I looked over their lunch menu and about six or seven different things looked tempting. I settled on the french dip au jus with cole slaw. My dining partner had the ham and turkey on pretzel bread with potatoes. (It isn't listed on the menu, but sandwiches come with a pickle, so if you hate them like I do, make sure to specify \"no pickle.\") My sandwich was fabulous. The beef was tender and not rubbery or tough at all like some french dips can be. The jus was just right: savory, but not too salty. I had been hankering for a french dip, and this didn't disappoint.The cole slaw was great: creamy, not too spicy, not too sweet. I sampled the ham and turkey, and it was good, but my sandwich was better. His potatoes were beautiful...crispy and golden on the outside, soft and piping hot on the inside. They weren't overseasoned like some places tend to do. The service was excellent. I get very excited when a non-chain place opens on the west side that's decent, so I have high hopes for this. I am adding this on my go-to list of places to eat: Babbo, Paradise Bakery, Ginger China Bistro, Jason's Deli, Betty's Nosh. My \"child\" is a Golden Retriever, so I am also very excited that they have a dog-friendly patio dining area. Even if the food wasn't amazing I would support them just because of that. More dog-friendly eateries, please!"}
{"text":"Food was just okay, nothing special. Overpriced for fairly basic food. That said, apparently they're known for the Mushroom Bar, which we did not try -- at $8 for two mushrooms, we just weren't that curious.   I had the flat bread - I've had better. It was bland and had way to much olive oil on it. I actually put salt on it, and I never put salt on anything.  My husband has soup and sandwich. They only have their mushroom soup, very mushroomy.  I can't imagine that we'll be back.  Also, I read on Yelp (while sitting at the table, wondering if this was a bad idea...) that they have happy hour all day on Sunday. No one mentioned that.  Oh, and the sodas are not from a fountain, but individual aluminum bottles. I prefer free refills on my soda."}
{"text":"I had dinner and a \"nosh\" beforehand for a business meeting.  Betty's Nosh is a find and I hope that there will be more of its restaurants throughout the Valley.    The appetizer was a large mushroom with beef tips and blue cheese.  Ah, comfort food!  Dinner consisted of the salmon with summer vegetables and two large mushrooms:  Indian Byriani and Angry Shrimp.  The Byriani is my favorite, very aromatic and perfectly cooked vegetables combined with beef.    The service was excellent and very friendly.  I can't wait for the weather to cool down and be able to sit outside on the patio."}
{"text":"TERRIBLE service. I have been to Betty's Nosh at least 3 times and I'm wondering why I don't just give up on the place already.  Every single time we have had to wait and wait and wait. This morning we called in a breakfast order ahead of time and when we got there that's when the unfriendly lady informed us that they ran out of croissants! So we spent 10 minutes waiting for them to make breakfast sandwiches on English muffins. The food is expensive and the place is ALWAYS a let down!"}
{"text":"Came here for Sunday brunch and nearly swore off the place based on initial impression. However, good food and better service once seated saved the day and we'll be back.  We came for Sunday brunch because the online menu looked good and were told the wait was 15-20 minutes. Thirty minutes later we were told \"just 10 more minutes\". Next we were told the kitchen was backed up and we could be seated but the food would be at least 30 minutes still. This whole initial experience was frustration as the place was not even close to full, but the manager came by (we didn't have to call her and she came by the wait area) to tell us they were down to two prepping the food. We went ahead despite the wait because we appreciated the manager's effort and honesty.  Once seated they brought drinks right away ($3 bellinis and bloody marys all Sunday, also local craft beer) and the server was quick and attentive. There were three of us and we all chose breakfast, each also opting for the english muffin that the menu boasted was homemade. The english muffins came out right away and were tasty and interesting (heavier than I expected, but more flavorful). The food was all very good and my steak and eggs came precisely to order including the doneness of the steak. One of the eggs looked like the yolk may have broken so the waiter asked me to cut into the the other to ensure it was to order. It was. I snuck a piece of my daughter's bacon when she wasn't looking and it was delicious (not crispy but done).  Our initial impression, with the odd wait and empty tables almost put us off. However the excellent service and well prepared food will bring us back for sure."}
{"text":"Great bar, excellent service and ambiance with great drinks and appetizers.  An excellent option for happy hour with friends or for a business meeting."}
{"text":"A colleague and I stopped in for lunch on a Friday and it was FANTASTIC.   We shared the strawberry spinach salad as well as the Italian sausage cannelloni.  The salad was PERFECT. Ripe strawberries and blueberries, candied nuts, fresh spinach and a great dressing that wasn't too sweet and complemented the ingredients very well.  Our cannelloni was phenomenal. The sausage and cheese filling was wonderful as well as the sauce.  The owner was in while we were there and we told him what a pleasant lunch we had. He then brought out the chef to meet us who was so personable and friendly.   Definitely a very friendly close knit type of atmosphere in a great space with cute decor.  While we were there for lunch it would be a great date spot or a fun happy hour.  Such a wonderful experience. Delicious food and wonderful service!"}
{"text":"Hubby chose this place for Father's Day breakfast and it was an EPIC fail.  We were seated and our pleasant waitress handed us our double-sided menus to look over.  When she finally returned 10 minutes later, we all had picked out our choices for breakfast BUT were told that they were ONLY serving brunch for $25.00pp or 2 other entrees.  Now why would the waitress not tell us this when giving us our DOUBLE-SIDED menus to look over?  Why wasn't this posted at the front door?  I will tell you that as other customers arrived, they were equally surprised to hear this after they were seated.  All 6 of us sucked it up and ordered the brunch.  For $25, they offered omelets, prime rib, 2 different types of potatoes, mac & cheese, cold french toast, salad, veggies, fruit & dessert.  I was at least excited that there was an omelet bar ~ that was until my made to order omelet came back to me undercooked and runny (UGH), my son's had ham in it when he clearly stated NO ham.  Hubby's came with a beautiful thick ring of oil/butter surrounding the omelet on his plate.  Seriously, my 16 year old can cook a better omelet.  The carved prime rib was decent but as we walked the 2 table long buffet, we were greeted with chafing dishes that had the cheapie aluminum pans in them. . .the type that you can buy at the grocery store.  It screamed \"we pre made all of this yesterday\".  I get that you have to pre make many of these items for a buffet (that most customers didn't anticipate. . .tasteless mac & cheese and mediocre potatoes done 2 ways) but come on ~ put them in a decent chafing dish so it looks appetizing and not like you're eating at the family reunion picnic.  Wanting to get our money's worth, we went to the tiny round desert table where there were tiny-sized assortment of deserts that were dry and tasteless.  Betty's Nosh should stop purchasing these from the bakery they got them from.  The staff was nice but pretty clueless and constantly apologetic blaming management and the kitchen for the mass confusion of the menu and the messed up food.  No one wants to hear blaming and excuses. . .just put out a great food and great service.  I know that our party of 6 had the choice to get up and leave, however, made a 9:00 a.m. reservation a week earlier because we had another place to be at 11:30 so finding a place to eat on FD with a short wait would've been difficult at best.  None of us would have minded had the staff had their act together AND if the food was decent.  I felt like we got the royal screw job for the amount of money we dropped on a brunch that we didn't know about."}
{"text":"wasn't sure what we were in for when we went in but was pleasantly surprised. you have to try the Mushroom bar and Baked Alaska!"}
{"text":"One of the best spots in the west valley. Staff is friendly and helpful. They don't rush you or make you feel like they are watching the clock. Food is fan-fking-tastic try the Malbec if u like red wine"}
{"text":"I was a bit afraid to eat here because of so many reviews stating that it wasn't good, from service to price to flavor. Some friends wanted to take us here, so I went. All I can say is, if you had a problem with any of the above, it was just an off night. We were sat as soon as we got there and offered drinks right away even though we were still waiting for the rest of our party. My dirty martini was a bit to heavy on the olives, but good. We all decided to try a little bit of everything as far as the mushroom \"bar\" menu. The angry shrimp was fantastic and the best of what we ordered. We also tried the buffalo chicken, which was good, and the crabmeat delight, also one of my favorites. For my main meal I ordered the salmon with red potatoes. Yummy!! We all were pretty full, but we went for the dessert. And boy am I glad we did! The bread pudding was so tasty. All in all, I will go back here again. And though I trust my fellow Yelpers, I am so glad that I took a chance on this place. Maybe the trick is to go on a Friday night when they are busy and have a full staff. Give them a try. I hope you have the same experience that I did."}
{"text":"Just left Betty's Nosh, nice decor (2nd star). First off, horrible optics, 7 servers standing in the middle of restaurant talking, while our sever was working the bar seating and outdoor patrons. Food, overpriced and poorly prepared. Ordered Thai chicken mushrooms with peanut sauce, shredded chicken breast was as dry a possible, peanut sauce...terrible. Beef and blue mushrooms...same as above different ingredients, same result. Reuben sandwich...store bought shaved corned beef..dry, stale pretzel roll...dry...seeing a theme here...last straw, another customer paid my tab, and I paid theirs and the waitress paid the difference out of her tip...as a fix. Where is the manager???!!! Nice to look at...but way overpriced for this type of service and quality. Needless to say, we won't be back...oh yeah, this was our first visit."}
{"text":"Came here the other day with a couple of girlfriends for Sunday Brunch! Service was excellent, I really enjoyed my smoked salmon Benedict (around $12.00), their waffle breakfast looked really yummy and the portion size was HUGE! prices were average but I was super impressed with their weekend Bloody Mary and mimosa special which is $3.00 all weekend long!  Great spot for a quick and casual breakfast or lunch!"}
{"text":"Just moved to AZ.  We had visitors from Hawaii and decided we could all experience this Mushroom Bar together and since it's so close to our house.  Our reservation was at 6:30 pm.  We wanted to start with the mushroom soup...\"sorry, we're out of the soup.\" We ordered several mushroom dishes and other items on the menu (recommendations that I read) and we waited.  Several minutes passed and waitress comes to inform us they RAN OUT of Portobello mushrooms and asked if we wanted sliders instead.  How do you run out of your MAIN ingredient at the beginning of the evening?  We can can get sliders anywhere!!! The waitress then tells us she'll bring us back the menu and will start the salad.  We said NO thank you, paid for our drinks and left.  The restaurant was not packed and tables around us was empty.  Bad experience for our guests and embarrassing moment for us!!!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Food is great. Service is excellent  ( especially TJ in the bar on weekends). Misty in the restaurant is really great also. I also haves good time here."}
{"text":"The food was good but the service in the bar area was bad. The bartender just seemed like she didn't even want to be there and was so rude! Took forever to get anything. This would be better if they had better customer service. I won't be back for awhile if that.."}
{"text":"I die for anything with mushrooms.  So, this mushroom bar hits the spot; the people and the food was incredible.   It's nice to know there are still restaurants out there where the chef will ask you how your meal was, and the owner will pull up a seat next to you to chat.   I had stuffed mushrooms with tuna, and the mushroom soup. I finished every last bite."}
{"text":"Odd experience tonight. It was our first time and we wanted to try something new and local. I asked for recommendations from the menu and I got the dreaded, \"everything's good\" response. My wife and I had chicken entrees. The chicken tasted good and was well seasoned. The steamed veggies weren't anything to write home about.  The mashed potatoes were luke warm but the rest of the food was very hot. Our server was apologetic and offered us an alternative. The portions were huge. We both took home a chicken breast.  For the prices, we expected more of a \"finer\" dining experience. Our bill was around $57. It seemed to he popular with the senior citizens. Maybe it was due to the time of our visit; 6:00pm.  Oh well, at least we have something for lunch tomorrow."}
{"text":"I've been here many times. Food is good but the last few times I've been here I've been completely ignored by wait staff. The bar tender finally had to come over and help me. He then had to try and track down a server or two that walked past me several times like I wasn't there. I ended up having to track down my own. There are plenty of open tables so they were not that busy. This is the second time I've had this happen to me. I am either completely invisible or their wait staff just consists of too many young girls that don't do their jobs very well."}
{"text":"I really enjoy the Sunday brunch. The omelets are very good and the scalloped potatoes are addicting. $3 bloody Mary's are fresh and have plenty of punch. I go for the mushroom bar during the week when I want a quick meal that is different and of high quality. Try it!"}
{"text":"The angry mushrooms were awesome, crab cakes were some of the best I've had in a while.  I didn't have any problems with the waitress, but the ladies in my party were not happy with the service.  Good food, good music...I'd go back for sure."}
{"text":"Thanks Carrie, you were a doll and you really knew how to take care of my husband's and my needs! It was the first time that he and I have been on a date night in quite some time, so it was even more enjoyable having such great service!  The mushroom appetizer was superb and we really appreciate the staff doing three different flavors. I think next time I might make that and a salad my meal. I was so full that I barely ate any of my entree, which was the ribeye. It was okay, I thought it needed a little bit more flavor. I could be totally wrong about that though. I'll try it tomorrow as my lunch and give it another review.   Will definitely be going back and hopefully sooner than later!"}
{"text":"Oh my gosh..... The mushroom I got was DECENT. It was the angry shrimp. The flavor was sweet and savory but the taste of the shrimp gets heavily masked by the sweet sauce on top. I then ordered the trio cannelloni thinking it would be big enough for two people to share. I was wrong each cannelloni is literally an inch long and is overally rich. I don't know if it's cream cheese or marscapone that gets incorporated with the Ricotta but either way, way too rich! Last but not least I ordered the Tuscan grilled salad. More than half of my salad had wilted lettuce and the veggies were not fresh. An overall disappointment. However the GM/Owner came out and apologized on his behalf and stated that they have been having produce issues and offered a gift card. I will give this place another try just for their kindness."}
{"text":"All I can say is holy shit! This place is awesome! We had the club sandwich, shrimp mushrooms and canellis. Our server didn't try to up sell anything and gave us food to our liking. The beer and wine selection was good. I will definitely go back. Only issue I had was it was a little spendy. All in all good though!"}
{"text":"Manager at first refused to allow substitutions for seafood Cannelonni on Happy Hour special when I don't eat Seafood. It was A missunderstanding and they made things right. Food was delicious and will eat here again."}
{"text":"I took a group of business clients to Betty's for lunch and all of them absolutely loved the food! Great place. The one comment I would like to make is that every time I walk in I am being asked if I have a reservation even if the place is not even busy - what is that all about???"}
{"text":"Nice patio with friendly guests and cute dog during brunch. $3 Bloody Mary/mimosa on Sunday. My brunch pal ordered Bloody w Tito's vodka no mention by server that brought it up to $9 I believe she said when we got the check :( I got Eggs Benedict w scalloped potatoes. Should have done regular potatoes. Didn't like the look of them ( I was picturing something perhaps in a small dish/ better presentation.) Blob of brown and black. Found lots of large hard as rock parts in it and asked my server if this is how it's supposed to be? She said it was cheese and shouldn't have been that much. Brought me a small dish of them which was a nice gesture. Felt bad my friend got Betty's Salad w Shrimp added and wasn't impressed by size and price for it. Felt so bad since it was my idea to come here."}
{"text":"We ate here for St. Patrick's Day and the food was amazing!  The weight staff was friendly and very helpful.  We had never been before but glad we did and will go again.  We had the bread pudding for dessert and it was great!"}
{"text":"This place was a no brainer for me, I love mushrooms so everything on the menu I wanted to order! A little pricy, but eating out these days or food in general keeps going up so what can you do. Great atmosphere and super cute place inside. Can't wait to try the lunch menu sometime!"}
{"text":"I've been here multiple times because of the unique menu... It's always nice when you can have something different.  Each time I get the angry shrimp button mushrooms and I'm always amazed at how tasty they are! Some of the other yummy mushrooms are the florentine and cheeseburger stuffed mushrooms!   I've had the chicken Marsala which was very good and I love the Tuscan veggies on the side.   It is a little pricy for small portions, so I recommend going during happy hour. I would say at least try it, you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"May I start by saying, I really wanted to like this place.   This restaurant is a fantastic concept that is just being poorly executed.  I've now visited twice since they opened and both times it didn't meet my expectations.    The restaurant is nice inside.  Clean and contemporary.  There is a very inviting patio dining area, a regular cocktails/wine/beer bar, a mushroom bar area, and a coffee/pastry bar as well.  Apparently there is also a Sunday omlet bar.  In fact, as much as I liked each of these ideas, I think this might be part of the problem - this place is trying to be too many things at once.  But I digress.   The first time, the food was just okay.  There are a lot of small plates to share, so we ordered the prosciutto-wrapped chicken, the penni pasta, the mac and cheese, the Italian sausage and marinara stuffed mushrooms, and the angry shrimp.  The stuffed mushrooms were good - this place is really about the stuffed mushrooms, they have about 10 different creations or you can order them your own way - but everything else was just so-so.  Nothing to get excited about.  In particular, I noticed the chicken was very dry.  The sauces on a couple of these dishes were cold, which was unfortunate.  We attempted to order dessert, but learned that most of the things printed on their dessert menu were not in fact being offered.  Not the end of the world, we picked something else, a chocolate dessert of some kind and a mini cherry pie.  Both were good.  It took a very, very long time to get our check, but our waitress was otherwise reasonably attentive.  We chalked the disappointing things up to the fact that the restaurant had only just opened and was probably still working the kinks out.  Like I said, I really wanted to like this place, because there aren't many fun wine bars in Glendale, so I was willing to give it another try.    The second time I visited, there was a wait for a table.  Which was a bit odd, because there were only 3 of us, no one else waiting for a table, and plenty of tables were open.  However I understand sometimes there aren't enough waitstaff, they get hit by a rush, etc.  We were told 15-20 minutes, so we took a seat at the bar while we waited for a table.  One of the people I was with ordered a cocktail - can't remember the name of it but it had a floral-flavored vodka of some kind, Hibiscus maybe - and it was delicious.  However, the three of us each ordered one drink and the bill - just for drinks - came to $42, which I feel is very overpriced for what we got.    We were seated eventually, and it took a long time for our server to notice us.  Eventually he came by, we ordered several small plates to share, and he left.  The dishes came out one or two at a time with long spans of time in between.  One dish was the wrong item.  One came out nearly an hour after we ordered (which was when the server finally came to check on us).  The dishes are all very basic so they shouldn't take a lot of time to prepare.  One dish the server failed to tell us they were out of until the end of the meal so we just never got it.  When we tried to order something else to replace it, we were told they were out of that too - though we were sitting right in front of the kitchen and I saw the dish go out to other tables about 4 times.  We would've liked a second round of drinks but no one came by to ask.  And once again the food was just so-so; some of it was cold.  The caprese mushrooms were the only thing I'd recommend.  All in all, it was just a frustrating experience.  The server said he wouldn't charge us for the meal because it had taken so long, so at least we didn't pay for bad food and bad service.  But no manager ever came to ask us why we were unhappy, and we all left hungry.  Not the kind of feeling that makes you want to try a place again.    Overall it just seems like this restaurant is trying to be a lot of different things - in my opinion they need to hone in on a concept so the dining experience isn't all over the map (servers who aren't informed about the menu, dishes that are on the menu but aren't being served, dishes that are cold when they're supposed to be hot, etc.)  Both the line cooks and the wait staff could also use additional training, because the timing of the meal is way off base.  Food that comes out cold and an hour after it's ordered is always a disappointment.    I won't be going back, which is a shame because I live very near by and was excited to try this place."}
{"text":"Overpriced, watered down drinks.  Overpriced, tiny food portions.  Food fairly good.  Poor service.  I won't be back."}
{"text":"I \"use\" to be a fan of this restaurant! It was one of my favorite places for happy hour when I could get over there! Recently I met a friend for lunch. I am gluten-free so my options were limited, but I was still able to find something. I had chicken salad and the mushroom soup. The soup was excellent! The chicken salad was ok. My friend had a hamburger. Overall it was good with the side salad. For the most part I enjoyed the decor. It could use a little updating. The reason I gave two-stars this time was because of what we witnessed during our lunch. The owner was there and was obviously doing a site visit/quality-control. He was parading around the restaurant on his phone and ranting at someone on the other end. It was obvious that he was unhappy with the performance of the restaurant and/or his employees. He was slamming things around and speaking loudly. He came across very rude and belittling to everyone. His display of disrespect for his employees is extremely unprofessional to begin with, but even worse to do it in front of customers while they are dining. If you really want people to perform well, you must treat them with respect and you should have your meetings in private! I doubt that I will return to this restaurant because of the scene I had to watch through my entire lunch. I do not wish to give my business to arrogant and egotistical people such as this owner. Also, I do feel like they need to update the menu, maybe offer a gluten-free optional menu and adjust your prices. So therefore, I'm out! Too many other options in that area!"}
{"text":"Me and my girls met here for happy hour on a tuesday. The waiter was very good but our food took over 40 minutes to come out. My friend ordered a small salad and they served her a handful of lettuce in a big bowl. She asked them to take it back and add tomatoes and more veggies. It was returned to her with 3 small tomatoes and some carrot shavings. I ordered the pink flamingo martini which was good but not very strong. It was more like a fruity drink than a martini. For food I ordered the seafood cannelloni which was delicious. My friend ordered the bbq chicken mushrooms and they came out a bit over done and dry. So the waiter made it up to her by giving her a different order of mushrooms gratis. He also gave the table some crustini toast gratis. He was very nice. Overall it was an ok experience."}
{"text":"The name on the outside of the building says \"Betty's Nosh And Mushroom Bar.\" I'm not quite sure what to make of this place. Is it a breakfast place? A coffee bar? What's the deal with the \"mushroom bar?\" Haven't figured THAT one out because there is no explanation of WHAT exactly a mushroom bar is.   I really just went here on a whim. My intentions were to go to Biscuits Cafe on 59th Ave. but when I got there it was mobbed and I really didn't want to sit and wait an hour for a table to open up since I was by myself. So, I got out my trusty smart phone and looked for another breakfast/brunch place close by. Betty's came up less than 5 minutes away so I scurried on over there.  From an aesthetic standpoint when you walk in the restaurant it is quite nice. It's got a nice ambiance and is decorated nicely. On the surface, it seemed relatively clean and inviting except for the cool reception I got from a waitress who was busy trying to take care of a bill at the front register. She seemed agitated that SHE was the one who had to greet me (how DARE I come in to eat!) She just happened to be the first person I encountered. I hate establishments that don't have a dedicated host/hostess and just rely on whatever server is available to seat you. She definitely had her hands full but instead of sounding rude she could have just said \"Someone will be with you in a moment.\" What happened to polite and courteous service? Maybe I expect too much. But I digress...Eventually, a more chipper waitress took me and a menu over to a waiting table (which had crumbs on it -- strike number 1)...   It took a few minutes before my server came over to me to take my drink order. I ordered decaf as I normally do in the morning. My cup o JOe came out steaming hot and was strong the way I like it. Ok, good start so far...  My waiter was a bit on the slow side, in fact, in observing the other servers they all seemed pretty relaxed. To me It seemed there were long delays in him getting to his tables as he lumbered along from table to table and station to station, not really moving quite fast enough for my taste. I am of the opinion that when working in a busy restaurant one should move one's ass. Eventually though, he took my order. I ordered an omelette with spinach, mushrooms, cheddar and ham with a side of home fries and fruit, or so I thought. More on that later...  Prior to taking the order my coffee had grown pretty cold, and I hate cold coffee, so I got the waiter's attention and asked him to top it off. Over he came with a carafe of piping hot coffee. After he walked away I took a sip expecting hot liquid to fill my mouth, only to find that what I tasted was ice cold!  Okay, now here comes my order, FINALLY, from the same gal who seated me. I told her about the coffee and she very kindly apologized and scurried away to brew a new batch. Needless to say, she never returned. Wait...where was my fruit? She forgot it. Ok, getting a little frustrated here... Despite not having my hot beverage in front of me, I eagerly dug into the fluffy omelette. Oh no, now what?? What's this? I taste....peppers? I didn't order peppers? And where is the cheese? It was all wrong! They must have given me someone else's order because the eggs were cold (like it had been sitting). There wasn't a mushroom in sight and no cheese, but there were peppers, ham and spinach.  Remember, I ordered ham, cheese, spinach and mushrooms. On the flip side, the home fries were pretty darned good, I'lll give them that.  At first I figured I'd just eat the omelette since I was under a time constraint and this one had taken so long to come out. But when my waiter came by to ask me if everything was okay I just couldn't say yes and I told him my order was wrong. He whisked the plate away and said he'd get me a new omelette. In the process he noticed my coffee cup was gone and I told him what had happened. Five minutes later he returned with a fresh cup of decaf, which this time was hot.  All in all, I was there about an hour and 15 minutes, most of it sitting and wondering where my food was. I would say the food is okay but the service could definitely use a little improvement. It's a shame because I really I liked the atmosphere there. I think I MAY give them the benefit of the doubt and give it another try to see how a second visit might go...Stay tuned!"}
{"text":"Tripped over this place. Lovely patio, delightful service.  Happy Hour deals make sampling affordable and delicious.  Wines on happy hour are tasty and affordable.  Tried both Malbecs, each had its own character"}
{"text":"When I heard about the mushroom bar, this sounded like an ideal place for me to go.  In the end I would suggest this place as it stands currently as a place for a drink and an appetizer of stuffed mushrooms before going elsewhere for a full meal.  The drinks were excellent.  I suggest the cucumber melon drink on the menu, served in a copper mug.  They really should build this up as a special drink on the menu... as Hanny's in downtown does with a very similar cocktail.  It is quite tasty!  My partner and I shared two of the portobello mushrooms and were very pleased with them - tasty, but a bit costly at $8 each.  They were certainly fantastic.  The dinner, however, took quite a long time to come out, and when it did was not worth the fanfare that the appetizer had created.  I had a burger The bun was delicious, the meat... standard, and I ordered Chipotle mayo on the side.  The potatoes served with it were nicely spiced on the outside, but once biting in, the center was dry and uninteresting (I dipped them in extra chipotle mayo and it was quite good).  My partner had the Penne pasta.  We were hoping for a bigger surprise with the pasta, but it was your standard pasta from any run-of-the-mill Italian restaurant.  I will definitely be willing to give this restaurant another chance especially since I work nearby and the lunch menu looked better, but do hope that next time the dinner menu matches up to the drinks and the appetizers.  This place has potential, so I hope to see it move up in the coming months!"}
{"text":"Awesome casual atmosphere to hang out after work !!! Good food when you don't to cook and you want something classic !!!!  I plan on coming here several times and getting different samples !!"}
{"text":"Customer service is always spot-on. Make sure to stick to the mushrooms and let the waiter/waitress help you with the wine selection, they are great!"}
{"text":"Was in two weeks ago and thought food was poor. Restaurant was about half full and service still bad."}
{"text":"Stellar. I had the pleasure of meeting Chef Romeo; great guy, nice staff, tasty food. Just go! The chilled veg salad gave me renewed hope for my upcoming  \"omg what am I gonna make for dinner there is nothing in the house but veggies\" meals. Thumbs up!"}
{"text":"I usually come here for the happy hour after work which is good. My boyfriend really likes it. Mushrooms are good but the one thing that makes this restaurant make me choose something else when I am hungry is the miniature \"noshable\" salads. They are good, if you are an elf. They are TINY! They need to add big salads to their menu!!! Other than that, it is a cute happy hour place for people who enjoy mushrooms. And there brulee dessert is yum yum!"}
{"text":"Ordered the mushroom sampler and it was wonderful. Bart our server was fantastic and told me which mushrooms to try.  My favorite was the spinach and shrimp.  The vodka and ginger drinks with mint were very refreshing.  Overall great place to dine."}
{"text":"I hosted a get together at Betty's Nosh tonight to watch the Oscar's. Everyone had a great time, the food was fantastic, and the staff were so accomodating! Marty and Lawson took great care of us and made it a great experience. Everyone in my party was really happy and said they would definitely go back to Betty's Nosh again!"}
{"text":"My wife and I are big foodies (me, maybe literally), so when I came across this place at Open Table, we had to try it. The wife LOVES mushrooms and it seemed like  a wonderful Friday night adventure. When you walk in , it resembles what you might think after reading the reviews, sort of wine bar-ish, a little fast food-ish, interesting and makes you wonder what is coming. That's it for the positive.  We placed an extremely simple appetizer order of crab stuffed mushrooms and a nosh plate of angry shrimp. (we were warned by our waitress that the button mushrooms weren't actually as much \"stuffed\" as they were \"topped\"). We also ordered a bottle of the Pino Grigio and settled in...and in....and in... Sweet mushrooms, what the heck was taking so long?   35 minutes later, the waitress delivers out shrimp plate, but no sign of the mushrooms. No offer to refill the wine glasses and she was in such a  hurry, she didn't notice that we did not have table ware with which to eat our shrimp which is drowning in sauce and is not \"finger\" food. So, 10 minutes later she delivers our Portabello mushroom...\"oh sorry they made a portabello instead of the buttons...is that ok?\" Well, \"not really\" we said, I am just not a fan of the thing. Oh, and can you take the shrimp back since it is now cold and we couldn't eat it due to lack of utensils. She proceeds to grab the shrimp (Oh...and the plate is SUPER HOT warning was delivered about two minutes too late for my wife) and turn about, leaving the aforementioned mutant 'shroom and it sizzling plate Before she can get away, we reiterate that we would really prefer the mushrooms that we ordered....I still don't like the \"bellos\" you see.   The shrimp comes back a couple of minutes later, smoking hot and rubbery as a chew toy. \"Did they put that in a microwave. we wonder?\" 10 more minutes, no mushrooms. Fughettaboutit and bring us our check si vouz plait. Check comes...oh and \"I had them take off the mushrooms\". You mean the ones we never got? \"Yes\". Joy joy aren't we lucky!  Manager was called and that about wraps it up. We probably won't be back...except to use the gift card he handed to us. That maybe their last chance.!"}
{"text":"My wife and I had lunch here.  We started with the beef & blue cheese portabello mushroom. Extremely liberal with the beef and it was very delicious.  I ordered the Angus Beef burger with Provolone cheese on a cibata roll. Absolutely one of the best burgers I have ever had in my life. Popeye's friend Wimpy would gladly pay on Tuesday, Wedensday, Thursday & Friday for one of these burgers today.  My wife ordered the Rueben sandwich. It was served on pretzel bread. I thought what is pretzel bread? It was fantastic.Once again, very liberal with the meat, saurkraut and cheese. The sandwich was so filling, I had to finish a whole half of my wife's sandwich. LOL  Dessert, now we were both pretty full, but what the hell. I ordered the three little baked Alaskas. My wife ordered the raspberry mousse. As I told our server, I can now go home and die, as life gets no better than this.  If you want a truly delicious gourment experience without the price tag, this is the place. You can not go wrong with anything here and the staff is second to none.  Thank you Chef Romano, you have a hit here."}
{"text":"Brunch is good even though they don't start until 11am. Great atmosphere and customer service. Plenty of space and tv as well for entertainment ."}
{"text":"Ok, read the reviews good and bad, but still wanted to try this place out.  My wife and I loved it,  got there just after happy hour. Yes it was busy but the staff is super friendly and took care of us right away. I had the chicken marasala loved it. Also ordered Mushrooms and this being my first time eating them I really enjoyed them.  I don't get the negative reviews.  I'm positive we will go back."}
{"text":"Very nice, clean, and bright.  Interesting shroom menu.  Tastiest bread pudding.  Drinks with a nice long pour!  Will return next time I am over on that side of town.  How bout one in Scottsdale????"}
{"text":"Great place, great atmosphere, great service and great company with my family.   Everything we ordered was delicious.  I was obsessed with my fries and the veggie sandwich. It was on point.    I shall come back."}
{"text":"This was a strange experience that would result in our NOT returning, bit the specials and tomato sauce are worth the return. plus it's a concept I wish I thought of first!  The negatives include a lengthy wait to be seated, slow service, lack of silverware, long beverage and food wait times, dirty dishes set on nearby tables.  We really loved the Cannoli trio (especially the price) but it's overloaded with heavy Alfredo/cream sauce. The tomato sauce is the shiz so next time I'll skip the trio and just focus on a traditional Cannoli w sauce.  As for the piete bello stuffed caps, the Shepherd's pie was tasty but too salty. We appreciate a heavy hand on the salt but this walked the line of distasteful. The beef tip and blue cheese was good too, except in such a few small bites there was an unpleasantly textured piece of beef.    However, our waitress notified the manager on our excessive wait times (we never mentioned it bc we sat near the mushroom stuffers). The manager apologized.  The menu offers many interesting plates and combination possibilities that I will definitely return. It's more likely we will return when there are out-of-staters so they can experience this unique and very tasty treasure."}
{"text":"This was not my first pick, but the Oggi's next door was packed on Friday evening. We saw that there was seating over here so we decided to try it. 2 Words- \"WAY overpriced!!!\"  $6 for 5 small slices of garlic bread dripping with EVOO and covered with diced tomatoes? And that was Happy Hour pricing? Really? Owners, this isn't SCOTTS-dale, it's GLEN-dale. I was confused by the front door area having a Coffee Bar? I didn't get that at all. Signs were all around proclaiming it was the home of the \"original mushroom bar\", but then I hate mushrooms, so I wasn't going to seek out any bar that serves fungi. If its there, I didn't find it, thank goodness.  We ended up being seated on the Patio on a day that was around 90 degrees, but this was near 7pm. PLEASE turn off the misters!!!! There was a guy (also just inside the front door, making this area even more awkward) that was playing guitar. I didn't really hear him much from the patio area, though. The Patio area is very nice, just really cold when its not sunny, yet the misters are blasting away and somebody thought it was OK to bring their dog out there? If I want to eat with dogs, I can stay home for that and spend about $6 for the same food and 2 rounds of drinks that cost $30 from here (again, these were supposed to be Happy Hour prices). Next time I'm in the area, I'll wait to get in next door at Oggi's. The only reason its a 3 instead of 2 stars was the service was very friendly and the place is very well kept."}
{"text":"**2.5 stars**  Food was okay...nothing memorable.  Went during happy hour and had the Alfredo flat bread, angry shrimp mushrooms, and kobe beef sliders. Flat bread was really oily on top and has a sour aftertaste, eek! I ordered the sliders medium and they were very dry. Maybe I should get medium rare next time. Also the beef didn't have that \"kobe\" quality or taste, but they quantity of meat was so minimal, who knows? The mushrooms were good but super buttery. And two mushrooms for 6 bucks (happy hour price) it didn't seem worth it. Good thing we went during happy hour, menu seems a little pricey for such mediocre food. Service was slow but friendly.   It's too bad really, I was excited to try this place. Overall food and vibe, is a little \"pretentious\". Check out their website and you'll catch my drift. Will come back to give their breakfast and sandwiches a chance."}
{"text":"A girlfriend and I met after work for an early dinner. Wait staff was awesome. It wasn't very busy that early (430pm) and we got to sip a drink and go slow on ordering. I eventually ordered a Caesar after asking if they made the dressing, and they do, and that was a plus. The flavor was excellent and I'm a big Caesar fan and have been disappointed at other restaurants but not this night. The staff returned to fill glasses but did so discretely and keeping us full up.  My GF had tacos and was happy with her dish. Relaxing atmosphere as well."}
{"text":"This place is really nice.  Almost seems more like a place you would see in Scottsdale or Fountain Hills.  Service was great.  They went above and beyond checking back with us several times.  Food was delicious.  We had a Godfather mushroom appetizer and I had the chicken Sonoma w/ veggies and mashed potatoes.  I really enjoyed the live music they had.  I'm told it's on Friday and Saturday nights.  We came on a Saturday.  It was just one guy with an acoustic guitar doing covers but he was really good.  I'll be back here for sure."}
{"text":"What a nice find! Recommended by a friend, surprisingly large inside, compared to what I saw from the front if the building. Outside covered seating is a plus. Four of us had the appetizer stuffed mushrooms, and 1 had the fish and chips. There are so many stuffed mushroom choices! Everyone raved about what they ordered. I personally had the Italian sausage and also tried the angry shrimp stuffed mushrooms. Others had crab stuffed, and carbonara. Happy hour drinks... I had the \"well\" margarita, which was so tasty, I had to have another one! We all enjoyed our different desserts, too. We'll be back to try more of the menu!"}
{"text":"Went during restaurant week. I loved the concept of having a stuffed mushroom bar! This was the highlight of the visit, and If I did go back it woould be just for hte mushroom bar. Mine were stuffed with short rib and blue cheese and my hsuband got spicy shrimp, both excellent. The entrees were just OK. Generous portions of steak au poivre and chicken marsala, but the steak was a bit over peppered (I know that's what we ordered, but...) and the chicken was a bit too sweet. The banana Baily's mousse was awesome and my pineapple upside down cake was OK. I'd like to go back as I said for more mushrooms and somre really good looking stuffed pasta we saw going out of the kitchen."}

{"text":"Great choices. We had Cannelloni's - Seafood and Italian Sausage. They were outstanding."}
{"text":"Great food. However, the portions were RIDICULOUSLY small considering what they charged. Probably won't be returning unless they increase their plates."}
{"text":"Very poor service had angry shrimp mushrooms shrimp tasted old spoiled not good wouldn't recommend this place"}
{"text":"Great service! Attended a friends pre bachelorette party here along with around 25 other women. Amazing cocktails and wine list. Atmosphere was very relaxing and laid back. The spicy shrimp stuffed mushrooms were addictive and I will be back for more! Great happy hour"}
{"text":"O...M....G....I was on the west side of town for a Dr appt and I saw this place. It sounded familiar to me and I remember seeing it on TV, maybe Check Please, not sure but I decided to check it out and I'm so incredibly glad I did. I took my order to go and my server Laura, was so sweet. She made recommendations and took a little time going over the menu with me. She told me the French Dip was amazing so I decided to go with that. It is delicious! Tender roast beef, medium rare, and cheese on a soft baguette. Served with crispy shoestring fries and au jus. To top off the great food and service, it was easy to get in and out of there as its right off the 101. I just turned out and was on the freeway. Check this place out....I know I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Wow!  What a horrible experience!  Work happy hour 10 people, 20 minutes to get a few of the people's drinks, we had to ask the waitress for the rest of the drinks, then had to go to the bartender to finally get them.  They told us it would be $3 a plate to split appetizers, really appetizers!  Food came out very sporadically and getting another drink was a joke.  I give them two stars because the food is decent......"}
{"text":"This used to be our favorite place. After several changes to their menu we will probably quit going. They took our favorite mushrooms off the menu- the two best ones- buffalo chicken and black and blue. The waitress was rude and \"busy\" as she informed us repeatedly despite only 4 tables from what I could see. The two drinks were weak at best. She also told us the owner is contemplating changing the angry shrimp shroom too- that's the only one we like that is left on the menu. Very disappointing- this place went downhill fast!"}
{"text":"Wanted to try this place from seeing it on \"Check Please\" and reading other articles and reviews.   Decided to go here on my birthday for a Saturday lunch and was looking forward to the extensive menu from breakfast to dinner food variety.   Drove from Scottsdale which was a 30 minutes away and when we got there after 1:00 pm we were the only 4 in the restaurant.   When we arrived we had a lunch menu and I asked if there was breakfast or dinner items available and they said there was just the items on the lunch menu available. What a disappointment!   We ordered the french dip, the chicken salad sandwich and the crab and shrimp canneloni. The French dip sandwich was good size with a large dipping bowl of au jus. The meat was tasty and some what tender. The chicken salad sandwich was refreshing but average. The crab and shrimp canneloni was rich but very good.  The best item we ordered was the mushroom sampler. This was very good which we ordered th r mushrooms with Italian Sausage, Angry Shrimp, Spinach Florentine and The Godfather. All were served in like double spoons and very tasty and presentable.   Would like to try the breakfast or dinner menu and really was disappointed that it was not available."}
{"text":"Good food, good service, fair prices.   Visiting Phoenix, decided to stop here for dinner for novelty aspect of Mushroom Bar. Started with the Angry Shrimp and Mama Mia mushroom. Mama Mia tasted a bit like a pizza mushroom and the Angry Shrimp was very mild.   Entrees included the fettucini and Bettys famous salad. Both were exactly as expected, nothing spectacular but good.   For dessert we had the brownie and the peanut butter cheesecake. Brownie was delicious and the cheesecake was good.   Overall the waiters were very friendly and checked in regularly. Overall atmosphere was nice. Prices were fair, a bit high for the food."}
{"text":"Great Service!  Jill always takes care of me!  The food is great, excellent atmosphere and happy hour is a great value.   This place is clean, well managed, and always welcoming... This is a must for west valley dining..."}
