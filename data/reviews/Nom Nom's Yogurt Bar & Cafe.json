My husband added peppers to his and it was very flavourful.  We will be going back!!!"}
{"text":"Absolutely lovely atmosphere and a '5' for decor and being a unique model for a food business. It's in old downtown Brampton, and the structure of the unit is basically a 3 level split. The main floor is a smaller entrance way, with a few chairs and tables. Upstairs is the largest area, with frozen yogurt, soft serve and other sweets. You pay for the bowl of ice cream by weight (and there's also lots of topping options), which is nice, though these things always tend to come up higher on the scale than you would've guessed.

On the lower floor, they have the hot table/panini/pizza cone area. No, that is not a typo, they sell pizza cones. Before you start to assume like I had that this was some bastardized North American take on pizza - apparently the origin is Italian and the oven itself was made and shipped from Italy. The cone (crust) itself is quite good and even better than a good number of pizza places. The toppers - or fillings rather - were okay, neither here nor there. It's still a fairly fun way of eating pizza, and actually quite practical too.

In general, the food offerings themselves from what I've tried are fairly good, albeit a bit unspectacular. I have to say however that I super impressed by how nice of a space it is, how friendly the staff are, and the professionalism of how it's run. Worth checking out, and very family friendly."}

{"text":"Looking for PIZZA CONES in BRAMPTON? You gotta get your derriere ove here and try them out!

Located on Queen and Main, this spacious store boasts frozen yogurt on the top level, and pizza cones on the bottom! 

The cone was not only crunchy and delicious, but the amount of toppings you can put into it is amazing! You can choose from the original which is just cheese and tomato sauce, or you can go the long route and choose from pepperoni, mushrooms, ham, bacon, onions... The list goes on!

Making the cone is amazing, and the process the cones go through before they're ready is definitely a sight for the eyes! They only need to rotate around once before they are transformed into golden brown cones of deliciousness! They get placed on a stand and then you get to do everyone's favorite part... Dig in!

Despite the basement of this place being very small, the person who runs the pizza cone bar has a big heart and is a great guy to be around! He definitely knows his stuff and enjoys having conversation!

So what are you waiting for?! Go ahead and try out the pizza cone! You'll enjoy it! I know you will!"}
{"text":"The desserts for $1.33 aka 6 for $8 was very good. The banana bread was amazing, it was very moist and had that great banana taste to it, the portion was exceptional. I didn't particularly care for the brownie or the M&M bar, but the Oreo cheesecake bar and the cranberry cheesecake bar were very good. The skor bar was very interesting, it was made with crackers, caramel and skor pieces, I definitely appreciated this treat.
Unfortunately we didn't quite understand what happened with the frozen yogurt. They were these small cups that could barely hold 3 or 4 spoonfuls so it wasn't exactly the greatest experience, but they tasted really good... it was just the portion size that was disappointing. This was a skip the dishes order, so I'm not sure if the containers were kind of on a whim as opposed to well thought out. The frozen yogurt was $10 for 4 servings and a dollar per topping, we all felt that cost versus quantity left a huge disparity.
We will be visiting this location in person as opposed to going through skip the dishes to get a better idea of how the actual location is in congruence to serving sizes and cost etc."}
{"text":"They ruined it. That's all I really have to say. They just reopened a couple weeks ago to (don't quote me but I believe new ownership? Fresh something?) and I was excited to go back because I had the Pizza Cones and sandwiches in the summer. 

I'll start off with the sandwiches, they're gone. All they have now is overpriced salads and random stuff like cheese balls. When I went in they pushed the healthy stuff, you can tell that's what ownership thinks is what everyone wants. That's not my problem, healthy is great. But 9+ for a salad? Just make your own at home! 

Now, for the real issue... the pizza cones. I bought one expecting the freshly doughy hot treat I remembered for 4-5$. Now they cost 7$ a piece, 8$ after taxes. I got the Roma cone, essentially just the same cheese and pepperoni cone I had last time but with pesto (apparently, didn't taste any) and 3$ more expensive. The lady (who was very nice) pulled out a tray of old crusty cones and starts filling it and puts it in the machine. When I got it to my seat and bit in, the cone was more like a big cracker and it wasn't even hot inside! It was like eating a pizza pocket you put in the microwave but not hot enough. 

I left disappointed that they ruined their pizza cones and feeling ripped off that I was still starving and 8$ in the hole. 

Skip it, not worth it anymore."}
