{"text":"Yesterday was my second of many to come to Fat Sandwich...  .

Great Food, Super Employees, VERY Comfortable N Friendly Atmosphere. As I stood there watching them prepare orders, each sandwich was prepared with care, as if they were fixing them for their selves.

The price, compared to what you get is unbelievable..

My advise is to either take a friend and split a sandwich or be really, really hungry. Or you can do as I did, make two meals out of it. The Sandwiches warm up real good in a toaster oven...

So if you're tired of that hum-grum burger joint... Fat Sandwich is the place for you...  

Mamahlf
A Very Happy Senior

PS... For all you 1,2,3, Star Raters... Please explain to me why you would go into a place named 'FAT SANDWICH\", THAT LIST FRIED BURGERS, FRENCH FRIES AND OTHER FRIED FOODS.. THAN COMPLAIN THAT THE FOOD IS GREASY, FRIED AND UNHEALTHY... DUH!!!"}
{"text":"Don't Do It.

Food sucks. Service is slow and the workers are shady.

I once made the mistake of buying a $15 coupon worth $100 in food.

Drunk Kids on Unofficial wouldn't even it this garbage. You WILL feel sick the next morning.

You will Thank me later."}
{"text":"Sandwiches are huge, warm and yummy. This is the only place to eat when in Champaign. Guys were super friendly and helpful. I had a sandwich that was a mix of a gyro chicken tenders mozzarella sticks and fries. Awesome."}
{"text":"If you haven't tried Fat Sandwich, you have not lived. To be completely honest, I've only had one or two of their full sandwiches, but their mac and cheese bites, mozz sticks, and every other side that they offer are just so delicious. It is everything you want in a fried food place. Delivery is really fast considering I live two miles from campus and the prices are very reasonable. This is pretty much the perfect late night place. A must try for sure."}
{"text":"Why did no one tell me about this place until today? Can you say YUM?!? Fast service. Polite staff. Very clean. The owner even stopped by to make sure we were all happy. Yes, it is junk food at its best ~ but we all need (okay, want) that sometimes. I love the fact they own up to the fact and don't have a side menu that offers lettuce and low cal dressing."}
{"text":"Honestly, I'll get straight to the point. This place only hits the spot when you've been out with friends all night and are craving some greasy combinations. The sandwiches are huge so it's understandable why the prices for each sandwich is a little much. But it's not worth it if you're looking for a lunch in the middle of the day. It's more of a go there at 1 am type thing. The later it gets the messier it is because of the amount of college students traveling in and out. Staff was friendly but overall nothing special."}
{"text":"Positively horrendous. The food is sickening, greasy, stale, and in horrid combinations (mozzarella sticks and chicken nuggets and mayonnaise and fries on a donut bun? really?) The tables are never wiped off or cleaned, and we had to sit in these gross chairs with used kleenexes tossed everywhere which we grudgingly had to pick up and throw out ourselves. My friend used the restroom and reported that her shoes stuck to the floor with every step. The entire place was swarming with flies. It Was Very Bad."}
{"text":"While fat sandwich may not have the best service, they are at least friendly. Anyways they're college kids working at a late-night drunk food place--what do you expect? Fat sandwich is a great place to go if you're looking for fun food options (think appetizers + cheesesteak sandwiches loaded with fries inside or on the side). Definatly fun and worth a trip."}
{"text":"These guys are very friendly, the service is fantastic. Also, they are willing to put the fries on the side if you ask, I love everything I order from this restaurant. I have never had a bad experience here."}
{"text":"Wow talk about personality, this place is wild. I remember standing there looking at the huge menu with music blaring while thinking to myself do I really want Pizza bites, Mac and Cheese bites, mozzarella sticks, jalapeno poppers and fries on my sandwich......... why yes I do! The sandwiches unique mainly consisting of fried things with meat and cheese and French fries. This place is not for you sissy men, it's for you beefy bros who are HONGRY. I highly recommend. Oh yeah, try the \"Big Fat Ugly\" ."}
{"text":"VERY slow service.  I clearly said NO onions on my cheesesteak but it was smothered in onions.  I are it since I was so hungry after the wait."}
{"text":"I have been to this place twice. And each time I couldn't finish my meal because of how gross the food was. The first time I went there (sober), I ordered fries that I had to French in ketchup to be able to eat half of them. I threw the rest away. The second time (drunk), I ordered a sandwich and only had two bites before I threw it away. In my opinion, the worst place to eat in Champaign."}
{"text":"This place is gross. I got the Fat Milf and it was shameful to eat. Everything is frozen and fried. However, I'll probably come back if I'm hammered. Service was great though.

I literally almost sh!t my pants when I was riding my bike home. I was sweatin. 

I feel like a gained 5lbs from this place from one visit."}
{"text":"Gross food.
Gross people.

I've gone there two different times, and the sandwiches are always flavorless piles of fat and salt. The cold fries that they put on top are by far the worst part.

To be fair, their breakfast sandwiches (\"Hangover Helpers\") are pretty tasty when you're actually hung over. Otherwise I wouldn't eat them either."}
{"text":"Horseshit service. Coked out girl working the counter with red hair had a phone conversation while taking orders talking about having sex with multiple people and messed up all orders. Waited 30 minutes for a cheese steak...embarrassing as a business. Must have yelled the F bomb thirty times and people waiting for their food.

Highly recommend avoiding this place."}
{"text":"This food is a greasy ball of delectable food coma. I generally got the Fat F. You don't want to eat this every week, but you have to have it at least twice a semester. Some of the best drunk food you'll find."}
{"text":"Good taste. Bad the delivery man has really bad attitude. My good emotion was totally ruined by him."}
{"text":"Completely disgusting. This place is not \"epic\" in fact, the menu is comprised of very very low quality ingredients."}
{"text":"As someone said - it is what it is, late night grub for undergrads. 

Ha, i'm an undergrad myself, but I like this place. If it weren't for the fact that deep fried food is bad for you, I'd probably hit this place more often than I do. 

Nothing really bad about the place, the staff is cool and likable. Those who come here ( read : males, man, men, boys, guys, those-who-don't-care-about-how-their-skirts-look etc. ) are here cuz they're hungry and you can bet that you won't leave this place with an empty stomach. 

I'm being a bit liberal with the stars - it really deserves only 3, but considering that this place is some sort of a niche place and that they don't really claim to serve healthy food, you get what you expect. For that I guess 4 is appropriate."}
{"text":"At fat sandwich, you really get your money's worth. for the amount of food you get, the seven dollars is nothing. And nothing fills you up better at 2am then fat sandwich. I would recommend the fat cubby. The gyro sauce just goes too well with the fries, cheese sticks, and chicken fingers."}
{"text":"Crazy combinations of ingredients and always enough food to fill you up! This was always my preferred late night stop for food. It's also amazing that they deliver beer and cigarettes. (I've never used that service, but I'm glad to know it exists!) Whenever I'm in Champaign, you can probably find me here."}
{"text":"When you feel like just pigging out and not caring how your food is made this place is delicious. I tried the big fat ugly challenge with my friend one time. Only was able to eat half of it and felt like crap at the end of the day.  Still would do it again for fun if given the chance."}
{"text":"I eat here all the time (even when not drunk) and I always get the Fat Milf. 

You gotta really like food to eat here because people who care about calories shouldn't come here ever. Mayo, ketchup, bacon, chicken fingers, mozz sticks and load of fries you can't go wrong. 

It will leave you feeling like a log after eating, but it goes down so good. 

Can't beat the big ass beers either"}
{"text":"Fat sandwich is like a storefront given to the \"brains\" of EpicMealTime or Man v. Food - except everything you buy is a challenge, and they still technically have a challenge.

Imagine a hoagie roll filled with everything that you could purchase at Sam's Club that you can realistically deep fry, add condiments, then top with french fries. Then name the sandwich after something that reminds you of a party school with serious collegiate sports teams, i.e. one sandwich is called the \"Fat Tailgate.\"

I had said \"Fat Tailgate\" and yes, finished it all - every morsel of cheeseburger, mini corn dogs, ketchup and mustard - yes, while completely conscious at 2 pm. I had a gut trophy afterwards. It was beautiful. I also didn't want to eat for another two days.

If you're particularly bold and want to impress me, I dare you to try their food challenge, the Big Fat Ugly. It's two hoagie rolls filled with 4 cheeseburgers, double cheesesteak, chicken cheesesteak, gyro meat, grilled chicken, bacon, sausage, pork roll, mozzarella sticks, chicken fingers, chicken nuggets, something cheese bites, fried mushrooms, jalapeno poppers, pizza bites, onion rings, has browns, American cheese, ketchup and mayo. Apparently if you eat this under 15 minutes, it's free.

As for ambiance, it's typical for a grease spoon except that you can buy t-shirts. I've seen guys come here after intense gym workouts and families after tailgates.

I'm add this to my Central Illinois trumps Chicago list because food like this must be illegal."}
{"text":"I'm fat... It's 1am... I've been drinking for hours... And I'm HUNGRY.... BUT for some reason you guys are closed even though your hours are posted as open until 3am!!  Very disappointed because I've been looking forward to putting a Fat Milf in my mouth all day long!! Sooo... I'm stuck at the crappy White Horse Inn drowning in my sorrows, wishing I had a delicious Fat Milf to satisfy me.  F U Fat Sandwich!"}
{"text":"The only explanation I have for why this place is still in business is that people hate themselves. The food is awful, the emloyees are usually stoned, and the bathrooms smell like the zoo. The food consists of various types of terrible fried food mashed into a sandwich. Usually when something is that bad for you, there is still some enjoyment that comes with it. Not here. 

Fat Sandwich steals your soul and crushes your spirit. Don't eat there, for your own good."}
{"text":"The Fat MILF and the Fat Magnum are my go to orders.  

I only come here after going to the bars when I'm not craving Mexican food.  The combination of all the fried and fatty foods is what drunk food is all about!

The employees are pretty cool and they can be funny.  I'm not sure if I'd want this type of food though if I was sober!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome. If you want a huge over the top sandwich then definitely give this place a shot. The guy working was very cool and helpful. Since it was our first time eating here he told us some of the more popular sandwiches and the current specials they had that could save us a few bucks. 

Also they had old school pinball machines which I really love. Check this place out! You get a ton of food for a reasonable price."}
{"text":"I'm sorry, but I cannot get down with the Fat Sandwich Company bandwagon that's going on in this college town. Maybe because my stomach is not as youthful as it used to be. I kid you not, this place seems like a drunk frat boy went into his freezer, took every frozen item in there, and threw it on a bun. I had the Fat Luigi, which included meatballs, marinara, cheese sticks, and french fries on a french roll. This sandwich had potential, but the meatballs were definitely the ones that you buy in your freezer section at the grocery store. I was not impressed with the food, and the bathrooms were gross. The guy at the counter was nice, but that is really the only good point."}
{"text":"Went here the weekend of  my niece's graduation after seeing the store on the Food Network Outrageous Foods show.  It's a sandwich shop with a wide variety of food on the menu.  Good portions and decent value for the price. Lot more interesting than going to Subway."}
{"text":"I have heard all the rumors about the sandwiches and they didn't disappoint.  You can get any and all things fried on your sandwich.  Even though it is almost all fried it is still delicious and I'm sure would be even better after a few drinks. It is a unique and delicious experience."}
{"text":"I read about the fries on sandwich and wanted to try it.

I got the Fat F sandwich with cheesesteak, chicken fingers, and mozzarella sticks.  All sandwiches come with mayo, ketchup, and fries.  One bite and it was over.  It's so hard to swallow that first bite and then get it down.  But it's pretty good as well.  The salty flavors of the chicken fingers and cheese sticks draws you back for more.  I could only finish half the sandwich before I was defeated, knocked down by grease, salt, and that chewy dough texture that makes you want to chew and chew.

I probably wouldn't come here again on better judgment, but I might just one last time."}
{"text":"This is more of a burger place than a sandwich place. Most everything is deep fried. My daughter ordered the chicken fingers and they were served on a hot dog bun smothered with marinara and cheese. Ewww! The place doesn't seem extremely clean and the bathrooms are rather gross. I'd steer clear of this dive. There has to be better food in the area."}
{"text":"Aww... come on guys. It's not THAT bad. And seriously. It's called \"Fat Sandwich Company.\" This ain't going to be classy dining. Also, considering the placement of the restaurant... CLEARLY, they will most likely hire undergrads, possibly of the tool variety. Whatever. It's cool. They need money to pay for their beer too. Don't hate.

That being said. I heart the hangover sandwiches. Egg? Good. Cheese? Good. Sausage? Good. Hashbrowns? Goooooooood."}
{"text":"Serving food like this should be a crime. In theory, fat sandwich could have worked. They could have served good, greasy, creative food, and I would have been all over that like a fly on shit. Instead, all the flies on shit you'll find here are just the ones crawling around their kitchen.

The basic idea of a fat sandwich is that you take all this prepackaged frozen finger food and pile it into a sandwich of your choosing, such that you can get fried mac and cheese, tater tots, french fries, hamburger patties, gyro meat, mozzarella sticks, sausages, and chicken fingers all in one large, nasty sandwich.

My main problem with fat sandwiches is that they're serving you the same fried garbage that you could get for half the price in the freezer section at Sam's Club, except that they've somehow made it worse. They're using the lowest quality of ingredients available, and it is completely apparent upon the first bite you take.

Every single ingredient they use just tastes godawful. It doesn't really matter what you pick to put on your fat sandwich, because it will all taste the same. Again, let me emphasize, EVERY SANDWICH TASTES EXACTLY THE SAME. Combine that with the fact that they're serving this food in days-old rolls that have the taste and consistency of paper, and you just feel insulted. I got food of this quality inside my high school cafeteria, and I have no interest in suffering through it again.

Now obviously, you have to be pretty inebriated to want a sandwich like that. Fat Sandwich Co knows that, and they prey on that. This place loves to encourage self-destructive behavior like binge drinking, smoking, or eating their sandwiches, and if it ever has customers inside, it's a group of loudmouthed frat boy stereotypes covered in their own vomit. But no matter how intoxicated I am, I will never ever make the mistake of eating at this hole ever again. The fact that we're all a bunch of alcoholic college students is not an excuse to serve us bad food.

The thing about us is that we're also as poor as we are irresponsible, which helps to remind you of how bad of a decision it is to go here. $8 for a fat sandwich. 8 fucking dollars for this shit. Then I can complement it with a $10 pack of cigarettes, in case I'm stupid enough to fall for your 50% upcharge. At least charge me what this garbage is worth, you sanctimonious assholes."}
{"text":"Okay, so this place is just ridiculous! If you want to be utterly shocked by your lunch, appalled at someone else's lunch, or an excuse to get an EKG and an angioplasty, this is the place for you. I think the shock value is what deserves 5 stars.

It's in a college town, so it fits right in. You basically can order whole menu items (like chicken tenders, an order of onion rings, a hamburger, or a grilled cheese sandwich as a TOPPING on your actual sandwich. 

\"May I have a cheesestake sandwich please, with chicken fingers, mozzarella sticks, bacon, ketchup, and mayo on top?\" 

\"Why yes you can. One fat milf coming right up!\"

You get the idea. So, as a place to add to your bucket list (next to \"bypass surgery\"), this place is a must. And the food is really good. I like the fries and rings and fingers (not sure I want them on my chicken sandwich), but who doesn't like them some fried, right?

Couple practical considerations... 
1) It's loud. Come prepared for bar-like atmosphere (the TV's up a couple notches higher than my old ears would prefer)
2) All sauce-related toppings are slathered on in excess. I'd recommend all sauces on the side.
3) It's hard to get cute college girls to notice you in the right way if you eat there too much. Just sayin'.

But you gotta try it once!"}
{"text":"It's like a weird coming of age ceremony to drunkenly order a sandwich here. That being said, the sandwiches are artery-clogging and stuffed with everything bad for you. On a diet or hoping to get a healthy salad? RUN AWAY. THIS IS NOT THE RIGHT PLACE FOR YOU. This is where bad decisions are made. They're not phenomenal or anything special, and the sandwiches are pretty bland. Everything in it just tastes like mushy gruel flavored with frying oil once you start chewing. I honestly think you can get more sensation for your tastebuds at Subway or Jimmy John's. I felt mild regret and shame as I consumed a Fat Bastard. My heart skipped a beat as it tried to pump energy through my body to process this beast, but alas it all went straight to my everything. 'Never again,' is what I thought as my stomach groaned in agony."}
{"text":"Horrible. Once you get past the gimmick of fried everything on the sandwich it is just an awfully dirty and gross and cheap place to be. Literally stopped at the gym for a steam to try and sweat the grossness out. An extra employee, a little sanitizer, a towel, and a broom would go a long way here."}
{"text":"It's a Man V. Food type place - has Adam Richman made his way down to U of I yet? there's a fat sandwich with his name all over it.

Like one of the reviewers below said, it is what it is. Not a place I can recommend, a donut burger is not food, it is a heart attack waiting to happen. On the menu board, I saw cigarettes and beer delivery service. Freshman 15? at this rate, I'll consider that lucky.

My review is not to judge the bad food culture that this place is promoting. The food, on it's own, was average. Sure, it was a fun magic trick, pulling out random chicken fingers and mozzarella sticks covered in ketchup and mayo in a brown bag, but the +45 minute wait for what should be fast food is not okay and the guy who took my order wanted a tip."}
{"text":"I remember drunkenly looking at the first sandwich I got from here, and telling my friend, \"hey dude, I think I have your sandwich...I didn't order fries with mine\".

\"Nah man, they all come with fries\".

That fact exemplifies the absurdly delicious sandwiches they serve.  Cheesesteak, chicken fingers, mozzarella sticks, bacon...it's all there.  I've got to say, though, that they may win the prize for best drunk-ass food on campus.  It is a bit more expensive than other options, and you'd probably need a heart transplant if you went here twice in one weekend (er...which is what I just did...), but it's undeniable drunk bliss.

My only real complaint is that it also takes a while to get the food out.  Kind of makes sense when you realize all the different components they need to fry to make any of their sandwiches, but the long wait is made more painful when you're wasted and just want something to eat."}
{"text":"If you're a health freak, I'd advise you to stay away from Fat Sandwich Company. Otherwise, if you're down to coat the linings of your stomach with fatty oils, do a little damage to your cholesterol, and have the capacity to fit clogged arteries once in a while, this place will do just that for you.

This menu items here are unconventional. Imagine a big hot dog bun, filled with things such as fries, mozzarella sticks, chicken nuggets, onion rings, beef patties, bacon, ham, egg, mayo, ranch, ketchup, etc. Gross, right? Well, once in a while you just got to put your guilty conscience aside and set the fireworks in your stomach. Fat Sandwich Company can provide the perfect venue for that. Just go for a long run the day after. I wouldn't advise doing it right after your meal as you'll get pretty darn full.

You live life only once. You might as well try their monster challenge... It's as big as a standard NFL football. Finish it by yourself and you get it free."}
{"text":"Ok, in theory Fat Sandwich is kind of funny.  

Imagine this as a business proposal.  Let's blare (and I'm talking BLARE) classical music early on a Sunday morning to get the goat of all the hungover college kids coming in looking like zombies.  Make the kids wince under the horrible fluorescent lighting as they try to read the menu and massage their throbbing temples.  Make the menu misleading, never saying that all the things you think you're getting as side orders are actually stuffed onto a sandwich, that thanks to all the necessary bells and whistles, doesn't actually have much of the main substance you ordered said sandwich for.  Charge upwards and onwards of acceptable prices.  Never, ever clean the bathrooms and in fact, add in artificial pee scents.  Watch money roll in.  

Now let's be serious here.  This is reality.  I'm not in college any more, I don't have a lot of money, I'm hungover, I don't want my fries smashed into a sandwich and all I want is a goddamn meal, not some novelty on a plate.  Pass."}
{"text":"Slightly embarrassed to say I have never been to this place intoxicated and am still giving a 4 star review.  

My husband (a U of I grad) and I have been here 4 times over the course of the past few years and have never been disappointed aside from the less than sanitary bathrooms midday.  The least exciting menu option (in my humble opinion) is my husband's favorite, that being the hasbrown, sausage, egg, and cheese breakfast sandwich.  I try something new everytime, and I even felt compelled to buy a \"What the F\" shirt.   Word."}
{"text":"Fat Sandwich is ONE OF  A KIND!

I give the owners huge props for bringing something so cool and unique to Champaign.  Anyway, to the food, i LOVE it, and i've never been here drunk!  I always get the Fat Cubby minus the Tzaiki sauce...its awesome, though i need to pick off some fries to finish it.

My wife will eat a half and love it, my son, who is 10, loves it and its 2 meals for him, and he creates his own sandwich, the fat adam LOL  basically turkey, gyro, chicken fingers ketchup and firies.

i can't wait to see this place at 1 AM LOL i can only imagine how hilarious it is.

GO HERE!!!"}
{"text":"A true American icon.  People ask where our culture is, and I point to Fat Sandwich.  Nothing better encapsulates the uniquely American perspective that, if things are good independently, they must be better together.  In high school civics you called it the melting pot.  Now that you're in college, call it a Fat Sorostitute, tzatziki and hot sauce.  Some day you'll know it as manifest destiny.  God Bless America."}
{"text":"People read the title of the place Fat Sandwich... Don't go there for a salad, if you want healthy food go to the subway that is close. 

Jeez people everyone is giving unfair reviews people there are very nice and give you what you ask 30k in a sandwich"}
{"text":"Delicious food and excellent service.  I went for the classic Cubbie (their tzatziki is LITERALLY out of this planet) and have zero regrets, but I was also surprised to see the amount of variety on the menu other than the fat sandwiches I expected.  The owner happened to be working, and was extremely friendly.  Definitely going back"}
{"text":"I shouldn't even have to write a review. It's everything you imagine it to be. Yes, it's messy. Yes, the shop is a bit sticky. And yes, there will be drunk people in line every weekend. BUT the heart attack inducing sandwiches are so worth it."}
{"text":"The name says it all. The thing about this restaurant is that you should go in expecting exactly that \"a fat sandwich\". If you are expecting an exceptional meal, you will be disappointed. However, going in with the expectation of feeling full, eating some greasy goodness and getting your fill of junk food for the whole week, you will be satisfied.

I have only ever had the sandwiches, and they are all very good. If you are looking for some greasy comfort food, venture to Fat Sandwich Co. FYI, all the sandwiches have some hilarious names and they also have some funny t-shirts."}
{"text":"Terrible. Truly awful.

I guess the idea is to give you really heavy food for when you're either drunk or hungover. But - I'd imagine I'd just puke if I was the latter, and I don't think any level of the former would make these sandwiches actually taste good.

I'm pretty sure this place was thought up by some stoned frat boys. \"Dude - you know what would be really sweet right now? A sandwich... but with a donut for a bun - with fries not on the side but in the sandwich - and mozzarella sticks and bacon stuffed in for good measure!\"

Bad frat boy. Bad.

Avoid avoid avoid."}
{"text":"FOOD: 1 star - I would have rated the food 3 stars if hadn't been for the disgusting pubic looking hair I found on my food. I got the fat frat and it didn't have any cheese steak meat as advertised. I'm all for full flavored (aka fat & salt) food but the hair and meat aside, it just wasn't all that good.  

SERVICE: 3 stars - Friendly service. It's an order at the counter and pick your food up at the counter kinda place. 

ENVIRONMENT: 2 stars - The decor and ambience could use some work."}
{"text":"Come here only after break ups/depressions. These sandwiches will make your body feel like it only has a couple minutes to live. 

I would suggest taking at least half the fries off the sandwich if you want to taste anything else. 

This is a place that's worth a try once to talk about how ridiculous it is, but nothing more. Not something I would crave ever again."}
{"text":"Not entirely sure how a place like this can survive, even on a college campus. They literally take anything that can be deep-fried, put it in a sandwich and then cover it in greasy french fries. I had what I thought was one of the healthier sandwiches, the Fat Luigi. It was a meatball sub with marinara, mozzarella sticks and fries. The upside, beer is cheap. $1.50 for a 312 bottle. Very surprised about that. And $1.25 for can of bud light. They actually ask for tips, which is strange and uncomfortable. Meh. 
Probably won't go here again."}
{"text":"Most of the reviews here aren't very fair to this establishment.  It is what it is, and if you don't want a sandwich stuffed with different fried foods, then you're in the wrong place.  I've been here after drinking, and it was great.  Otherwise, I only come here when I am experiencing a particular brand of self-loathing, in which case it is still pretty good.  

The \"Fat Sorostitute\" has been my go-to for the past several visits.  If you come during the day, while sober, the people that work here will be pretty nice and courteous to you.  If you come at night, while drunk, they'll be less so.  I know I couldn't serve drunk people all night without getting a bit mad, so I don't blame them.

Also, I suspect the counter is relatively high to keep drunk people from doing something stupid.  I think this is funny."}
{"text":"I'd heard about this place from a few of my devious minions and since I was in the area and spotted it I hit the gas and grabbed the first spot I saw on the street and jumped out.  I had already researched their menu and had decided on my Fat Sandwhich about a month in anticipation (obsessive? Who me?).

The place was clean and  the staff professional, the Heavy Metal music?  I'm a fan!  The Fat Sandwhich I ordered was the Fat MotherClucker; Grilled Chicken, American Cheese, Mayo, Ketchup and of course it is served on an 8\" Amoroso Roll with fries inside.  Hey I ordered the grilled chicken to keep it healthy of course!  The sandwhich was fresh, well made and absolutely delicious.  

I couldn't finish it but with a smile on my face and another of their concoctions in mind I will return!"}
{"text":"Nothing wrong with the food and nothing spectacular either. The most notable thing about this place is that you can exercise your freedom to be as ridiculous as you want and order a sandwich filled with ranch, chicken tenders, cheese sticks, and fries. I've been here about 4 times all during my first year and a couple of those times I was sober (what am I doing with my life). I have never had a full sandwich or even half of one. I've only tried bites, so my opinion is skewed. The food is whatever. Not bad. Not good. I think you can imagine what the food at a restaurant that makes these kinds of sandwiches would taste like."}
{"text":"I just had the chicken caesar salad wrap. Now, I have a nauseous belly. This place is clean and the staff are friendly enough, but when it comes down to it the food is disgusting. I was also slightly grossed out by parts that were warm, and other parts of the wrap that were totally ice cold.

The chance that I come back here is about 0.00000001."}
{"text":"I really only suggest this place when you are tipsy or on the verge of being drunk and are looking for a place to eat. I only say this because if you walk in here sober, your veins and arteries will immediately clog up by the mere smell of grease and you will probably go into cardiac arrest.

That being said, Fat Sandwich is probably my go-to (drunk) place when I visit my friends at UIUC (University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign). The combination of mozzarella sticks, french fries, mac n cheese bites, and every kind of greasy glory you can imagine on one bun just overwhelms me in the best way possible; and it never disappoints. It's also really nice that every one there is most likely just as drunk as you are, possibly even more intoxicated.

My rating for this place while sober: I wouldn't eat here even if it was the last place on earth.
My rating while I am incredibly not sober: fuck yeah let's get some fat sandwich."}
{"text":"Not very good and I've spent a lot of time in the fat market. Sandwiches are over complicated and not really sure how they come up with them. I'm sure the place stays open for the hungover crowd. The ingredients are nothing special so not sure if a simpler sandwich would be good. They do have fast delivery."}
{"text":"This place is a dump. Which doesn't mean the food couldn't be great but it's not. The place is absolutely filthy. It's truly the dirtiest restaurant I have ever been in. The food sucked. Meat was very low grade, not fresh at all. Rolls were nothing special. Sandwich size wasn't even any bigger than a regular sandwich. It's a college hangout but this wouldn't even be enticing if you just left a keg party at 3am and you only had 10 bucks in your pocket. How the board of health doesn't shut this place down is being me. McDonalds is ten times better than this dump. Trust me on this one."}
{"text":"the hamburgers are like school lunch hamburgers that have been supersized.  that being said, i think my hamburger might have been the most edible thing on the menu.  my companion's food looked like vomit on a bun."}
{"text":"Best place to satisfy any and all drunk munchies.

Highly recommend while intoxicated."}
{"text":"Grossest sandwich I've had in a while...made by the most unkempt, greasiest, most stoned undergrads I've ever seen.  I think they used Velveeta for the cheese too.  In Wisconsin, shouldn't that be some sort of crime punishable by death?

Sllllllloooooooowww service (gee, I wonder why) for an easy sandwich.  

And why is their gimmick to put the fries in the sandwich?  Changing fry placement is NOT innovative.

Never again!"}
{"text":"I want Fat Sandwich to be better than it is. The problem might be mine. It's drunk food and I'm eating it sober. I go back because sometimes, after a stressful morning, I just want something unhealthy and tasty. Fat Sandwich delivers on those two criteria. 

However, let's talk about flavor. Most of the flavor at Fat Sandwich is coming from full-on grease rather than from fresh, flavorful ingredients or balanced seasoning. I haven't had an extreme sandwich there, although those are on the menu (piled high with multiple meats, fried foods, cheese, and sauce), but I recently had a cheeseburger. Cheeseburgers come with two patties automatically, cheese, and a grilled bun. The first few bites were tasty. The bun was lightly crisped and the beef had a good sear. The (American?) cheese was standard -- mild but able to stand up to the beef. Toward the middle of the burger, it started tasting -- suspiciously, strangely -- like a chili dog (I ordered it plain, so there were no condiments or veggies). Maybe there was some residue on the grill. I dunno. I finished it anyway.

As for atmosphere, Fat Sandwich is kind of a hole in the wall. It's not that clean, the decor is dingy and depressing, the guys at the counter have multiple facial piercings (not that there's anything wrong with that), and smoky grease hangs in the air. The place attracts and serves mostly men. I've yet to see another woman there, although I imagine one or two might brave it once every full moon like I do. As a woman I definitely feel the odd man out standing around to wait for my sandwich, but I've never been treated badly by anyone there, customers, cashiers, or cooks.

I will say this about the staff -- they really seem to care about doing a good job. A delivery order had gotten messed up and they were working hard to fix it, discussing how the order went wrong. The guy who turned out to be responsible felt bad about it. The place at the time was bumping with lunch customers and they kept turning out orders, too."}
{"text":"It's a college town.... maybe the generation Z is cool with this but I'm not.. it was pita bread & fries. That was all no taste no seasoning if you didn't have ranch you would probably choke ... I'll never visit the fat sandwich companies block again."}
{"text":"I'm not sure where all the hate is coming from but this place is pretty good.  t's not expensive and you get what you're looking for:  greasy, delicious, comfort food.  It reminds me a lot of the Grease Trucks in New Brunswick on the Rutgers campus.  Actually, I think it's the same thing and one of these entities copied the idea from each other.  

I got some fried cheese curds as well and that really just killed me.  Delicious but I definitely did not feel so great afterwards.  I had to throw away 2/3 of the curds because I was eating them by myself and I was eating them by myself because I've never been to Wisconsin before and all anyone ever asked me was, \"Have you tried the cheese curds?!?!\"  Had to try.  I don't think place is known for their curds but to a city slicker like me, it didn't really matter.  Cheese is fat is greasy is delicious is disgusting is so bad for you.

Basically, I could see this place getting five stars all around from drunk people who get really hungry.  However, State Street doesn't seem to lack for post-drinking eating."}
{"text":"This place is gross.  I left the minute I saw the menu.  Most of the sandwich names include some sort of derogatory quip about women.  The staff look like extras from a Van Wilder movie.  If you want a sandwich with chicken fingers, tater tots, and french fries all rolled into one and slathered in ranch then this is your place.  The place screams frat boy in the worst possible way.  Please don't give this place your patronage."}
{"text":"BEST drunk food that money can buy in Urbana. Most of the time they won't have all the stuff that goes into a Fat Milf, but they substitute it with something else, and you will always agree for that because you are drunk and you dont care!"}
{"text":"I jus came here for the 1st time, tried the Fat Lush which contains grilled chkn pieces, cheesesteak, BBQ sauce, mozzarella sticks and fries piled on. Let me jus say.. It's a Gr8 F'n sammich, 'Nuff said!! I'll definitely b bak! They serve beer too for 2-2.50 a bottle & sandwiches are around $10, not bad. Four pinball machines available, rather expensive tho(1 play is 75c, 4 plays $2)"}
{"text":"i can proudly say that when i was in college over my time there i ate every single sandwich on the menu (back when my body could take the abuse). Best sandwichs on the menu. Fat F, Fat MILF (best), Fat Sorastitute, Fat Cowboy, and a few others i can't recall. Worst are Fat Caesar and Fat Falafel, bleh those were nasty. 

This is a college staple and where you have to go if you have never been their before. Grab a six pack and drink while you wait. Eat it while its fresh it will turn nasty in your fridge. 

place is packed when bars close but empty just about any other time. Its super unhealthy but will sober you up in a minute. 

Good and Bad, at night they will take your name then call it when your sandwich is ready, BUT, they will ask you what you ordered. Its really hard to remember after a night of drinking so concentrate! They do it because people try to steal sandwiches."}
{"text":"Their sandwiches are ridiculous! Those things are stuffed with everything you could imagine, but the ingredients work together. I've been here numerous times during undergrad and I always go back when I visit."}
{"text":"First, let's set some expectations here. I rate places based on what I'm expecting from them. This place is not for those with stomachs that are sensitive to large quantities of oil, breading, and carbs. With that said, this place delivers ridiculous sandwiches stuffed with just about everything you'd ever find at a fast food joint. Fries? yup. Beef? yup. Mozzarella sticks? yup. Mayo? yup. I don't remember the name of the sandwich I got, but it had all of those things in a hoagie roll. The first 6 bites were awesome. After that, the world seemed to slow down. All-in-all, great value for a good fattening sandwich. So next time you're on a mission for a diet-busting meal, this is your stop."}
{"text":"I'm only giving it two stars because I do agree with previous posters that the food used within the dishes could be improved--that, and you can't eat here a lot lest you want to be--well, fat.

However, it's called \"Fat Sandwich Company.\" I'm not quite sure what part of that some of the other reviewers are missing, but it's not exactly high quality, restaurant-style food.

It's greasy, it's gooey, it's dripping--it's a fat sandwich. A lot of people in this area may not have experienced what a fat sandwich is, but it's basically a sandwich where you stuff everything that sounds delectable in it--mozzarella sticks? Sure. French fries? Absolutely.

It's not the best or thought-inspiring food experience you'll ever have, but it's something that satisfies hunger and it's worth eating at every now and then."}
{"text":"You get what you expect from a place called Fat Sandwich. Of course it's greasy and unhealthy, that's basically in the description of each item on the menu - it's a sandwich made from fried foods... If that's shocking, this probably isn't the place for you. 

The Fat MILF is magic though - it's cheesesteak, chicken tenders, mozzarella sticks, bacon and fries on top with mayo and ketchup. Sounds gross but it tastes incredible. 10/10 - would eat all the time if I could"}
{"text":"I've never understood fat sandwich. 

My brother gets it though, and we have to stop when we are in champaign. 

Basically, you take a bunch of fried foods and combine them into a huge sandwich that will make yourself hate yourself after you finish eating it.

It honestly reminds me of something Joey from friends would eat. 

Mozarella sticks? Good
French fries? Good
Cheesesteak? Good
Chicken fingers? Good
Hoagie roll? Good
Fat F sandwich? Goooooooooooooood

So if you want to gain the freshman 35 instead of the freshman 15, head on over to fat sandwich."}
{"text":"It is what it is, folks. It's terrible-for-you fried food stuffed into a thick doughy, chewy bun/roll/whatever.

I do admit that I once went on a 45- minutes road trip with my sorority sister here at 11pm one night just for this and Insomnia Cookies. I got the Fat Sorostitute, natch. I was kinda disappointed...too much bread (I don't really like bread), not enough filling. The jalepeño poppers and buffalo tenders were good, but I passed my mozzarella sticks to my friend. I'd come back with my friends but I'd get something different. They have a pretty large menu. I suppose this is good when you're hammered. I went on a weeknight and the guys working were friendly and kind of funny. Hustling a little hard for a tip but I get it."}
{"text":"Fat Lush, Fat Idiot, Fat Mess, Fat Cow, Fat Tailgate...

Fat nasty!

I wanted to like this place. I really did. The sandwich names sound good and greasy and I thought that if I was just perfectly, overly drunk, it would score. Nuh uh. Leave this place for the 2 a.m. State Street Brats crowd.

Think of all your favorite guilty fried pleasures: jalapeno poppers, cheese curds, cheese sticks, chicken fingers, and pizza bites. They even have macaroni and cheese along with mini corndogs. Now, imagine all of these stuffed into a soft bun and topped off with a handful of cold, greasy fries. That's Fat Sandwich for ya! Amazingly, of the two sandwiches we tried, even with all that grease there was no flavor. I wanted to pull out the salt n pepper n hot sauce! 

I walked down State Street the next morning and shamefully eyed the darkened Fat Sandwich window. It was covered in greasy hand prints and names written in grease. Ugh. Fat Goodbye!"}
{"text":"\"I am sitting in fat sandwich watching the hapless fool cooking this garbage. He has to take a step back every 3 seconds to check the ticket for each ingredient. Good lord this place is slooooooooow.\"

So I wrote as a I waited at FSC.  Then I got my sandwich.  it was mediocre."}
{"text":"Quick service, open late, and CHEAP CHEAP beer!  I ordered the buffalo chicken wrap and to my surprise, it was quite good.  My friend ordered a chicken sandwich and unfortunately, he wasn't too impressed.  There's minimal decor and rolls of paper towels are on each table.  It's somewhat messy, chair strewn about, garbage left on tables, etc. but it is somewhat expected when you're right in the epicenter of a college campus during homecoming weekend."}
{"text":"Pretty obviously made for drunken nights at UIUC, but still delicious sober. Too many people complaining about the \"greasy\" nature of the sandwiches. Seriously, it's called Fat Sandwich. If you look at the menu and what's in the sandwiches, you should know what you're getting into. 

10/10 I eat here every time I visit my friends at U of I."}
{"text":"To be fair, I didn't try their food. I went in to try it, and the smell of putrid grease was too much for me to bear. I literally HAD to walk out of there."}
{"text":"The food is ok, but I wasn't happy with the fact that we sat out in front of the store for an hour after they're said to be open (12) , not only did we leave and come back, but even at 3 they still weren't open. just because they're in college shouldn't mean be an excuse for opening whenever they feel up to it."}
{"text":"It's basically a big mess of american junk food goodness. 
Had the Fat Magnum and it looks like a giant brick of meat.
I am sure its good for drunk and stoned people. 
Their cheeseburgers are pretty good too."}
{"text":"I didn't know what was ordered for me, or why it took 30 minutes to arrive, but what I received was absolutely ridiculous.

Now I was pretty hungry, it had been a night out that reminded me of my youth, however on this day, I was a graying 30 year old, who needed some late night food.

I was not prepared for what I received.  I was under the impression I was getting a steak and cheese sandwich, what I received however, was a delicious endless abomination.  It was a gyro chicken tender and french fry sandwich, with a mozzarella stick packed in its behind for good measure.  What is this monstrosity?  I took one bite head on without modification, and nearly collapsed from the enormity of it.

Eventually I slowly deconstructed this mammoth, first removing most of the french fries, after realizing the contents of the sandwich I decided to cull a few chicken tenders off the top, those had left me full enough to where the rest of the sandwich - which looked like a delicacy a few moments ago - was making me sick from how full I was.

I debated packing the remaing 80% of it up and eating it for the next few days, or perhaps shipping it off to Africa where it could surely keep a small village going for 2-3 weeks.  However it unfortunately ended up in an empty bag of Doritos and then in to the trash.

Fat Sandwich - I don't know what you think you're doing, but please carry on."}
{"text":"I like this place mainly because it is so insane. I agree with the other reviewer--if you're not careful all the fried stuff can meld together. I prefer the wraps, mainly because they don't include fries. While I'll never order a sandwich named the Fat MILF or want both chicken fingers AND mozzarella sticks on my sandwich, I think that their lighter fare is pretty good and the prices are not ridiculous for what you get. Plus I love the one guy there who has all the crazy Justice League tattoos. Kills me every time."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to eat on Campus!

If you are not full when you leave there might be something wrong with you.

The sandwiches are huge and tasty and they have an enormous variety. Don't worry about the calories, just enjoy! You can eat a salad the next day to balance things out.

If Michael is there the customer service is outstanding! I don't think he ever takes a day off because he is there every-time I go. He remembers my name and always has time to chat a bit no matter how busy they are."}
{"text":"Just do it. Drunk or sober do it once in a while, not every day, that would kill you but once or twice a month when you're starving, fat sandwich hits that spot. The people are great, I've gone in and had some great conversations with the guys behind the counter, the staff is so friendly it's ridiculous. A+ service and great food for those nights where you just don't care about calories. My dad drives down from Chicago just to eat here, and that says a lot. My advice, get the mini corn dogs and the fried brownies. The Fried Brownies will change your life."}
{"text":"The sandwich was ok, but it took them forever to make it...even though there weren't many people there ordering food.  I think they actually made my sandwich, and then let it sit on the counter for a while (so it could get good and soggy) before calling my name.

Other than that, this place just made me feel kind of uncomfortable.  Not sure how to describe it, other than it's full of bros.  You know what I'm talking about.  There was also a really strange conversation between one of the employees and a customer, which included the use of language that clearly offended other people who were there (I was definitely not the only person who was confused).  I'm guessing the employee and customer must have known each other, but it just seemed inappropriate.  I feel like if you're over the age of ~19 you probably won't want to be in here, but maybe that's just me.

As for the actual food, it was decent.  Not good enough to make me come back though."}
{"text":"If you want some obese and delicious sandwiches, then this is the place to go. First of all, I feel like their creative ideas for sandwiches stems from Epic Meal Time (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9FRSghXhDM). They add fries to all their fat sandwiches. 

There isn't much space to eat inside. I know that they're trying to go with the whole \"divey\" feel, but divey doesn't necessarily have to mean dirty. The least they could do is wipe down the tables after they're used. They blast really loud rock music which makes it quite difficult to have a conversation with your mates. it was interesting seeing a group of kids eating here considering that they have sandwiches called Fat Sororistute, Fat Motherclucker, and Fat Milf. 

I felt the best part of my fat sandwich was the mini corn dogs. Also, it's open at 3:00am which is great if you're having a hankering for munchies after some late night studying. Mmhm."}
{"text":"First I have to say I love Fat Sandwich.  They usually have decent music playing, and if you wanna bring your kids he often has cartoon network or the news on tv during the day and nothing that parents may find inappropriate such as comedy central or MTV or something.  The general manager is a really friendly guy and gives helpful suggestions when it's your first time there and trying to order.  I enjoy all the food there and go a few times a week.  They also have beer which is nice.  Contrary to other reviews on here I like Fat Sandwich regardless of drunkenness and in fact I usually go there sober.  I'd also like to point out that things other than the fat sandwiches are okay, but not the best.  If you're going to fat sandwich you should get a fat sandwich.  Or maybe a chicken donut.  It is a bit pricy for a sandwich, but one fat sandwich will keep me full for quite a while so I think it's worth it."}
{"text":"I'll set the scene...

It's Halloween 2008, and you're half-drunkenly walking around dressed as Captain Hammer, with your faithful sidekicks Poison Ivy and 70's guy/Persian night club owner. 

You're feeling kinda hungry, and what could possibly sound better than a chicken sandwich served on a glazed donut? ...Okay, a lot of things, but you're drunk and willing to eat just about anything. 

The sandwich is pretty much what you'd expect... it's chicken and a slice of american cheese, served in a glazed donut 'bun'. It's not particularly delicious, but hey, it's food.

Okay, back to reality. You probably don't want that donut sandwich ever unless you ARE drunk, or maybe just curious and have a few friends to share it with. 

I was only there one other time and had the Fat Frat. It wasn't a BAD sandwich... but it wasn't very good either. That's the problem with having so many fried things on a sandwich. They all sort of melt together so all you can taste is the fact that whatever IS on the sandwich is fried. 

I will probably go back one more time ever, when my brother moves down for college in a few weeks. Ever since I told him about the place he's been jonesing for a sandwich with fried everything."}
{"text":"I think the other reviews are unfair.  This place does not pretend to be a high-end eatery.  The food is for college kids who working through a hangover or need to load up for an all-nighter.  That said, this place does the job.  I stopped there after a long car ride from BMI airport.  I was starving so everything tasted good (though  also had to remove a good amount of the fries to eat the sandwich like another reviewer).  It did take a really long time to get the sandwich even though the place only had 1 or 2 other customers.   I had no problem with the bathrooms but I imagine they are in worse shape on the weekends after everyone's been out to the bar.
They have rolls of paper towels at the tables instead of typical paper napkins.  I did have to use a lot of them after unwrapping my sandwich.

Basically a 2 star type of restaurant; sandwich shop/fast food, but it does a 4 star job of it.  Good, but the food could use a little more 'engineering' to taste better vs just paying for a lot of calories."}
{"text":"I discovered this place shortly after I moved to Champaign for school and have made myself a regular ever since. Their specialty is sandwiches with both silly names (Fat MILF, Fat Chief, Fat Sanchez, and so on) and wild combinations of deep-fried goodies to fill them with (french fries automatically included, along with chicken tenders, jalapeño poppers, cheesesteak, mozzarella sticks, etc.). They also offer a \"build-your-own sandwich\" option, sides, burgers, breakfast sandwiches, and wraps. The food is definitely not for those looking to eat healthy, but it tastes great and fills you up.

My only complaints are that the sandwiches are a bit pricy ($8.50 each on average) and the place itself is pretty understaffed - you would be very lucky to get more than person working at one time when you walk in. Otherwise, Fat Sandwich Co. has great-tasting stuff and should be tried at least once."}
{"text":"Honestly, this place is great. Its got \"college behavior\" written all over it and it tastes great; Drunk OR sober. Come in here expecting to feel bad after...or amazing depending on how starved you were. Don't expect little portions. It's a 
meal inside a bun. And it's an experience everyone should have at U of I."}
{"text":"Fat Sandwich Company. The name says it all really. The perfect place to order the most outrageous and over the top sandwiches that pack 2,000 calories into one 8\" bun. It is impossible to leave this place still hungry that's for sure. 

The place is small and divey, which serves it's purpose perfectly. The menu is as over the top as you would expect from a place named Fat Sandwich, serving up everything from deep fried cheesecake, to a 20,000 calorie monstrosity known as \"The Big Fat Ugly\", to a bacon cheeseburger on a glazed doughnut. They also deliver beer-- every college kids dream-- and they're conveniently located right on campus.

The bottom line is, the place isn't meant to be fine dining, it's meant to give you the most densely packed, calorie infused, cardiac arrest inducing food this side of the Mississippi. It succeeds and then some. Would recommend it to everyone at least once. Truly a local legend."}
{"text":"It is what it is- a late night restaurant for the drunk college crowd. My friend had been talking this place up saying it's totally disgusting but totally awesome (and right she was). She insisted we had to go AFTER the bars because I would probably want to murder her if we went sober. So we hit them up at about 2 or 3 in the morning; it was totally packed!

I really don't know what I ate, because I just asked them for something without any meat so they hooked me up. Nothing on their menu is meat-free, so you just have to ask when you go in! It had french fries, mac n cheese bites, jalapeno poppers, and mozzarella sticks on a nice french bun. A culinary delight worthy of a michelin star, clearly. It was fun to eat once, I was clearly intoxicated when I ate it which made it even more fun, the staff were really happy to oblige our drunk selves with conversation while they made everyone's sandwiches. 

Everyone's drunk and passed out all over the place so the place is jam packed with college kids sleeping while their friend waits for their food. I don't think I would dine in at this place. Drunk people aren't clean people, and as such it's kind of icky on the inside because I'm sure the staff just can't keep up with everything. Oh, and no bathroom after 10 pm for anyone. Why? Because idiots ruined bathroom privileges for everyone by gettin' it awwwwwn in the bathroom. Kind of a huge downside when it takes 20 minutes or so to order and get your food.

Will I be back? Probably not. Will I crave this sandwich again? Definitely not. Will I tell everyone I know about how disgustingly awesome this place is? Absolutely."}
{"text":"Restaurant review
With the wife out of town, I decided to indulge in food that my wife would never try. I ended up at Fat Sandwich Company not quite understanding the theme of the food here. To sum it up, greasy, lots of different toppings you would not expect to go together. The service was top notch, the guys behind the desk told me I didn't need to use the hooked app as the special of the day include fries and a drink free on Tuesday. When you go to order, there are some the most ridiculous names for the sandwiches including fat milf, fat frat etc. I ended up with the fat f which is Cheesesteak, chicken fingers, mozzarella sticks, mayo and ketchup. Since I wanted curly fries they threw those in without additional cost. The sandwich itself probably has over 1k in calories. Although philly steaks are good, the combination of all the food including the mayo and ketchup is a bit over the top. I would recommend this as a sandwich you would eat after a long night of drinking. I think it was a unique experience, but I don't see myself becoming a regular.

Pros: large amount of greasy foods, if you like fried foods this is a great place

Cons: very unhealthy, the mixture of items is great for college students wanting a carb and fat fix, but I think I will have pass on coming here again just due to the greasiness

Hidden deals:
Sunday 3 sandwich for 20 dollars
Monday 2 fat sandwich for 14 dollars
Tuesday free fries and drink with fat sandwich

{"text":"I love Fat Sandwich!  The idea that everything is a topping is a great one so I can get whatever I want and it isn't too expensive. 

I loved the Fat Blue and the Fat Cowboy.  if you order a side of fries expect to get about 4 potatoes worth. 

You can also order beer and cigars/cigarettes with your food and they even have a 2 sandwich 6 pack of beer special called the drunken three-way which is a great deal.

bring change for parking though as this establishment is located in the campus town area and you have to pay for everything there.  like they don't gouge the students enough with tuition."}
{"text":"I really hope the manager or owner sees this and responds. Last night we ordered food and it never arrived. Beyond that the first time we called to check up on it we got hung up on mid sentence. The second time we called the person on the phone said the delivery guy left a long time ago, we never received the food but did get a refund. Who was working that night?? This is extremely unprofessional and rude behavior."}
{"text":"Great place, one of the best sandwiches I've ever had and they are open crazy late. Would definitely recommend this place to anyone that is looking for some late night hungry food. Great speedy service and just crazy good food"}
{"text":"When I decided to order from Fat Sandwich Company at 1 am, I expected an extremely unhealthy pile of fried foods stuffed into a roll. That's exactly what I got. I ordered the Fat MILF, mostly because I'm immature and anything with bacon on it is probably a winner. I was not drunk  or high, just hungry.  Plus, everything else I wanted was closed and FSC seemed like the best remaining choice. 
As for the sandwich, it was delicious. It was a really big sandwich and took me quite a while to eat,  but I savored every bit of it. Obviously there are many people who wouldn't enjoy eating a sandwich filled with mozzarella sticks, chicken fingers, cheesesteak, bacon, and fries. I am not one of those people. $#!% was amazing. As I ate it, I felt like I was on Epic Meal Time. And that, my friends, is when I knew I found a winner.

The only downfall was that it was just warm by the time it got to me. Still delicious, but it would have been even better if I ate it hot."}
{"text":"Can you do anything worse than 1 star????  This is my first and only review so far.  I rarely was my time with this stuff, but I have been to a lot of sandwich shops in a lot of cities due to travelling for work and this is pretty close to the top of the list of the worst.  What a dump!!  Not only was the food horrible, but the whole dining experience was subpar.  This had the feel of a money laundering business.  We went around 1:00 PM today and one guy was working.  We aren't sure if he even understood English.  We had 4 orders in which 3 were wrong, one we couldn't figure out what type of meat was on it, and \"we think\" the last order was right. The hand held menu is different than the menu above the counter as well.  One order was a sandwich and we asked if a side came with it.  He said, \"No.\"  So we ordered a side of french fries and the employee didn't let us know that fries already came with the meal.  The one and only employee would randomly leave and walk down the street to do who knows what.  I don't know how anyone could give this place even 3 stars.  Not one of us ended up finishing our food.  Even if I was drunk I wouldn't be able to finish this food.  Just a horrible place to eat.  Instead of going here, put your money in the fireplace and burn it.  Save yourself the pain of trying to get the food down and eat at another unhealthy place."}
{"text":"It's in the name, Fat. Don't expect something healthy. It'll satisfy your hunger.

Good enough for me to come back if convenient."}
