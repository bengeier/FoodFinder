{"text":"This place is just too good. The cheese enchiladas are amazing! The rest of my family loves it too anything from shrimp tacos to veggie burritos everything is delicious. I'm so glad I discovered this place with my cousin a couple weeks ago!"}
{"text":"Excellent prices and flavor! Chicken Street Tacos are amazing. Customer service was superb, they even treated us to a complimentary churro."}
{"text":"Great food and freindly service and good prices.  Highly reccommend."}
{"text":"Great customer service and tacos with micheladas and margaritas. New owners are friendly. Great job!"}
{"text":"I haven't had great Mexican food since I left Los Angeles 5 years ago.  My search is now over thanks to accurate reviews on Yelp!  Food was delicious, the place was clean and the owner was friendly and welcoming.  I will be back."}
{"text":"I tried this restaraunt because I had a coupon.  I was impressed with the two hispanic gentleman behind the counter and grill that day.  Very polite and friendly.  The food was authentic, well priced and fresh.  I will be frequenting this establishment often!"}
{"text":"I hear they have good food.
I ordered 2 fish tacos to go and waited my whole lunch break and never got them.
Asked for my money back and left.
Very disappointed with the service."}
{"text":"Fish Tacos are the BEST! Margarita's are awesome! Service is fantastic! Everything is fresh and authentic."}
{"text":"I love this place! The environment is clean, food is delcious, prices are amazing, and the staff is fantastic! The red and green sauce is soooo good."}
{"text":"I love Rosati's pizza, which is located right next to Salsa Cabana, so I had driven by this place hundreds of times before trying it.  I have always been a lover of Mexican food, and I make it a point to try new places often.  I have tried dozens of Mexican restaurants throughout the Valley a number of times to get a feel for their various offerings, and Salsa Cabana makes the best fish tacos I have tasted yet, and their prices are unbeatable.  Taco Tuesdays are an especially good value.

Do yourself a favor and give this little hole-in-the-wall restaurant a chance.  If you like fish tacos or just tacos in general, the food will not disappoint."}
{"text":"Great stop! Family owned and operated. BEST fish tacos around!  Taco Tuesday here every week! I'm not a big fan of the salsa,  but everything else is on point!  Delish!"}
{"text":"I'm not quite sure if I ate at the same place as the reviewers giving 3 & 4 stars. If you think this is fresh and authentic I wonder where else you've been eating Mexican food. A microwave in the kitchen doesn't scream \"fresh\" to me. We were first put off by an odor when we first walked in and should have left then.   We were also the only customers on a Friday night. But I'd read so many good reviews that we ordered anyway. I ordered a combo with beef enchiladas with red sauce, rice and beans. It was terrible. The red sauce tasted more like tomato sauce than enchilada sauce.  My sister had a shredded beef tostada. The shredded beef was dry and not well seasoned.  Taco Bell is better and a lot cheaper."}
{"text":"This place is AMAZING!  We've being eating here for years and have never had a bad meal.  The owners are simply the best!  They are the hardest working people I know and the quality of their food reflects their commitment to their business!  And oh, by the way, if you think they are the only restaurant in town that uses a microwave to melt the cheese on their enchiladas, you are wrong.  It's just that not too many restaurants have an open kitchen where you can see how your food is being prepared."}
{"text":"Just ok, fish tacos looked good...but had tiny pieces of fish cubes. Same with Nachos...very small bits of steak. Chips not warm or particularly fresh. The serving bowls they came in were worn and frayed. Prob won't be back."}
{"text":"We had the steak tacos
They were very good and the gal that owns it was fun there 7.00 meal special was great 
Hidden next to greenfield cleaners"}
{"text":"Great little place!  Homemade salsa and the chips come out of the fryer and not out of a plastic bag.  Excellent value, especially for lunch specials.  Good food, friendly service, low prices.  What else could you ask for?"}
{"text":"The most bland beans rice I've ever had.  The taco shells are like tortilla chips, they fall apart after one bite. I used to like Chile Rellanos but no more!"}
{"text":"I really hate to rag on the corner of the Valley where I grew up, but if Salsa Cabana were located in West Mesa, Tempe, or Phoenix, I bet it'd have 2 or 2.5 stars. I've eaten tons of Mexican food in my life. I like both Americanized tex-mex and authentic Mexican (though I prefer authentic). This is neither. It's food at a weird way-station in between. I ordered two fish tacos, one shrimp street taco, and one steak streak street taco. Every one of the tacos had far too much in the way of toppings with an extremely meager serving of the base meat. Honestly, the meat probably made up 15-20% of the volume of each taco's filling. The meats were not at all flavorful (which is probably why they were smothered in toppings). There was way too much of the creamy sauce on the fish tacos and they were loaded with \"pico de gallo\" (which wasn't really pico, it was basically just chopped tomatoes. I'm not the type of yelper that knocks a place down to 1 star because the cashier didn't smile at me. I'm focused on the food. And the food here was, sadly, not good."}
{"text":"This place is legit. Lived in the area for years but some some reason we have never tried it! Fish tacos are on point! What sold me was the refried beans! They are authentic homemade! It's nice to eat Mexican food that has tea beans! It's sad how many Mexican restaurants open the cans of Rosaritas, add butter and milk and serve. It's shameful. If you don't serve good beans, you should be in the Mexican food business. We will be back to Salsa Cabana!!!!!"}
{"text":"I went for the first time today. The building was small, but bright and fairly clean. The staff was knowledgable and friendly. I ordered the steak burrito Mexicano and it was good. 

All the food came out hot and tasted good. Their red rice was a bit mushy and salsa was a tiny bit hot for my taste, but overall I had a good experience. The best part was their lunch specials.

 I got my burrito (which was large), rice and beans, and a soda cup (with one bowl of chips and salsa) for $5.50. There is also a 50 cent credit card charge-if this bothers you, bring cash! So after tax my total was $6.50. I still consider it a great value!

I enjoyed my food, that doesn't mean everyone will. I would recommend this place because it was a good value. Solid 4/5."}
{"text":"This is one of the best Mexican restaurant i have been to and all of the people that work there are very nice and approaching i came over here just to try this place and i come from California"}
{"text":"We are now regulars there. Staff is super friendly and helpful and their salsa is delicious!"}
{"text":"While visiting the Mesa area, I went here for their $4.99 lunch special 3 times in 1 week. Need I say more since if I think a place is just okay I rarely return. 
This is real Mexican food, the authentic goods, not fresh Mex. Real retried beans - but no lard so safe for vegans like me ( even Baja & Chipotle's pinto beans aren't vegan). Plus I could get the burrito sans tortilla since I'm also gluten-free. I do wish the guacamole was chunkier, it kind of reminds me of the Wholly Guacamole at the supermarkets. But the rest is just fine. It is about impossible to find a restaurant that I can feel satisfied & not hungry for $5 & that would be without the included drink! I'll miss this place when we head back home.
Owners are really nice, friendly & helpful."}
{"text":"Excellent food, great price, very friendly welcome. Portions are on the smaller side for a Mexican restaurant but you won't leave feeling hungry - just the proper amount of full. I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Great place for mexican food and the people who own it are wonderful. Best shrimp tacos I have ever had!"}
{"text":"The people that work there are so friendly - always joking with us when we come in.  The food it great, and the $1.75 Taco Tuesday Fish Tacos are exactly the same consistency and quality as during the week. Some places change the menu item to a cheaper fish for Taco Tuesday, but not this place!"}
{"text":"I'm a sucker for fresh, flavorful, quality Mex and these guys deliver.
Staff is always courteous; register lady is very sweet, the cook (which I think is the owner) is friendly too and will customize your dish if you ask.
While you wait, you get a bowl of fresh warm chips and some well crafted salsa. They make their own and sometimes have variety of different colors/flavors/hotness levels (ask). Although, that also means it's a little inconsistent, so don't whine if they got it a bit off that day :)
You'll get your food in more than reasonable time (even when it's super busy) right as it's made and ready.
Like others here mentioned their fish taco/burrito is awesome, thanks to their own made sauce and fresh ingredients (my favorite dish). I tried most things on the menu (used to work near by) and everything was good except a steak burrito I had once (the meat was on the dry side).
Horchata is fresh made and delicious.
Lastly, guess what, these guys have a liquor license; so if you're on the market for a noon margarita definitely try one.
Cheers"}
{"text":"So I have been going to salsas for 7 years now, usually 3x a week if we are being honest. Then i realized I have never written a review, shame on me. It is honestly the best Mexican food, and you can't beat the price. The owners and staff are like family. It is authentic and everything is great, but I pretty much live off the bean&cheese burros and green chicken enchiladas. I dare you not to become a regular!!"}
{"text":"This place is a perfect dinner spot! We just moved to the neighborhood so we tried it out. So glad we did! We went for a quick dinner and will definitely be back. The food was so great. Nothing to complain about. You order at the counter, and the lady was so friendly. She brought out our food and a high chair for my daughter. I had a margarita and it was so good! I highly recommend this place"}
{"text":"We went here and had such high hopes based off the reviews here. The beans were homemade which was exciting however as we were sitting we watched the cook heat all of our food in the microwave. Yikes! My chimichanga wasn't cooked all the way and was sitting in a pool of oil. The restaurant was dirty as well and there was no music . We ate to the sound of the fridge humming. Worst date ever. The service was also terrible. It was completely dead and the owner never asked how the food was. When we got up to leave she muttered, \"thanks\" while she was eating at a different table."}
{"text":"Save your money, the good reviews here are fake. Worst mexican food i had in a long time. As others have said they use a microwave to cook food and to top it off me and the wife both had massive stomach pain and wife felt sick 4 hours later, possible food poisoning. At this point any chain fast food joint would have been better then this place. Try it yourself if you want but i wouldnt advise it.."}
{"text":"This place was awful! I ordered a cheese enchilada and a chicken taco, Both were luke warm and I had to ask for chips.  which were stale. Gross. never again!"}
{"text":"This was our first time here and everything was absolutely phenomenal! The food was amazing all around! Tamales, Carne Asada, their breakfast burritos, my mom even praised their salad! It was all delicious, the service was amazingly friendly and this place is clean too! We will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"Really great fish taco's, yes they deserve five stars.  
If you are looking for an expensive fine dining experience this is not the place, but if you are looking for great, homemade, inexpensive food, served with a smile then look no further.  I bring out of town guests here and would recommend to people even if it is out of their way.
Some notes:  Ask for the special hotter sauce if you like it hot, it is super tasty.  Get the fish taco's, even if you are unsure about liking a fish taco.  Also, they will make it your way, just ask.
I do wish they had chunky salsa for the chips and salsa, but that is a personal preference not a requirement.  If you are in the East valley you should stop here."}
{"text":"If you want some delicious authentic Mexican food then come here! Tia Rosas is in the same complex area and they are nothing compared to Salsa Cabana. We are very picky with quality Mexican food and this is our spot! So glad to have found an awesome restaurant who cooks from scratch. Everything is handmade. The owners were working the cash register and they were just awesome people. They made us feel very welcomed and at home. They are easy on the wallet. Just come eat lunch here, you won't regret it. We'll be back Saturday morning to try the menudo and other soups."}
{"text":"This place is pretty good.  I only discovered it by happenstance a few months ago and have been back a few times.  I like their red sauce, they are always willing to make the modifications I ask for (I'm a really picky eater).  It isn't the very best I've ever had, but it's pretty darn good.  For the price/portion/taste, I'm glad I found this little hole in the wall."}
{"text":"Good food!  Refried beans are done right & salsa is  delicious.  Both the red and green sauce are from scratch and very tasty.  My husband had tacos that are very fresh with a good n crispy corn shell."}
{"text":"Salsa Cabana is in my family's top 3 places to eat. It's simple, homemade, and the the owners are great. Super cheap prices. Burrito Mexicano and Fish Tacos are the best items on the menu."}
{"text":"Great local restaurant. Dine in or take out available. Owners are friendly, hard working, and personable. I've yet to have something from the menu I haven't thoroughly enjoyed!"}
{"text":"This place is good!  I'm so glad I found it so I know where to go when my kid is doing sports at Gene Autry park. 

Was craving a bean and cheese burrito and the one I got here for less than $5 couldn't have been better.  Great tortilla, great beans and just the right amount of cheese.  The salsa bar is filled with cucumbers, radishes, salsa and avocado sauce.  Loved the avocado sauce.  You also get a little bag of chips with your burrito!"}
{"text":"Mmmmm. I love it. Better prices, preferred options, and closer to my home than my usual Mexican food spots. Quick, friendly service. I really like the little squeeze bottle salsas - super convent. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Always loved this place. The new owners have stepped up! They have revamped the entire place without altering the great food! Congrats to them on earning my 5th star!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite little locally owned Mexican restaurants. The food is very reasonably priced and is super good. Good sized menu with all of the usual suspects - tacos (duh) tamales, chimis, carne asada, salads too. 2 choices for brewed iced tea (mango and regular.)

Food is great, service is super nice. Hubby tells me the bathrooms are super clean (as is the rest of the place.) 

Go check it out."}
{"text":"I had the special, chicken burrito. It was muy excelente! The rice and beans were great, and the chips and salsa was really fresh and tasty. I asked the lady to warm the green sauce so I could add it to my burrito, and that made it taste even better!! I will definitely go back here for my next Mexican food craving."}
{"text":"Wonderful atmosphere.  Loved the colors and textures!  Food was really good: my usual dish is Chile Rellenos and this was really tasty. Cons, if any. The wide screen TV was playing a movie with full volume! Whut?  Also, the menu said \"flan $1.99\", so ordered it and they said \"$2.95 including tax\". Again, wtf.  Will be going back as the menu was expansive."}
{"text":"My first time tasting their tacos.  My husband got combination #6 but he was disappointed, sadly he said it's missing a piece of lime in each taco, then the portion of the rice and beans were very small. I do admit the fish taco was tasty but was missing a squeeze of lime as well. 
Maybe I'll just come during Tuesday's for the taco Tuesday deal since the fish taco was tasty. That's why I gave the 3 stars if I didn't like them it'll be 1 star."}
{"text":"The people are nice, but I should of know when I walked in and there was no Mexican customers that this was not going to be real Mexican food! This placed shouldn't be labeled Mexican it should warn people who come from out of town expecting real Mexican food!!!"}
{"text":"This Monday, my husband and I decided to try a New Mexican restaurant that serves seafood tacos. I came across Salsa Cabana a few weeks ago when a fellow Yelper checked in there and left a great review. When I checked the other reviews and star ratings, I bookmarked it so I would try it soon.

The place is pretty easy to find. Well lit in a big shopping center. When we arrived there, two others tables were occupied. The restaurant is small and dicey. The first thing you notice when you walk in especially when you walk up to the counter to order, is how clean the place is, especially their kitchen. I was very impressed. The lady who took our order was extremely patient with us. With so many orders and some of our food limitations, she walked us though the ingredients of some of the options they had on the menu and after we chose our orders, she made sure she put in any special requirements I had for my food. After ordering and being seated, the waitress brought fresh chips to our table and suggested that we get any salsa or condiments from the salsa bar. The first thing we were pleased with was how fresh and crispy the chips were. Also, their salsa bar had many different choices that you can pick from. 

I got some pickles onions, mild salsa, salsa verde, some guacamole and some cucumbers and radish. A few minutes later, our food came out. We ordered 2 carbon tacos, both were beef, one shredded and one steak on corn tortillas. We also ordered menu option number 6 which is 2 tacos, rice and beans. We ordered 1 fish and 1 shrimp each and we skipped the beans for all rice. Out of all the tacos I tried, my favorite by far was the shrimp taco! It was flavorful and cooked perfectly and it tasted great with the cream and cabbage. The shredded beef was pretty good and so was the fish taco. The steak taco was slightly on the dry side. 

Nice clean place with excellent service and fresh food at a good price. We will be going back again for more of those delicious shrimp tacos!"}
{"text":"Our dinner spot. We always get the chili rellano (SP?)  The street tacos are $1.25 and are good."}
{"text":"This is our new go to Mexican restaurant whenever we're in the Mesa area. Was a little worried when we first drive up and saw it was so small and you had to order your food at the front but we were glad we went in. The food was fabulous and not overly heavy. Went back again today (Tuesday) for fish taco Tuesday which were only $1.95."}
{"text":"Great street tacos!! Family owned! Taco Tuesday is the best deal for the fish tacos!!"}
{"text":"So good!

My daughters constantly ask to come here, and my husband and I don't complain. 

Their prices are great and the food is even better

We've had their burritos, rolled tacos, tacos, enchiladas...  loved them all. 

Their service is usually quick too and you get free chips and salsa."}
{"text":"Nothing great. Would not go again. I ordered some steak fajita dish. I could probably fit all the steak in the hand of a small child."}
{"text":"I was in this part of town and called in a order for Chicken burrito and flan . Both were good and tasty however my favorite thing here is the variety of Salsa. Service is friendly and prices are reasonable at $8-$15 for most meals. I recommend Cabana ."}
{"text":"Great food! Outstanding service - really truly loved it.  I am a tough Mexican food critic - awesome!"}
{"text":"TACO TUESDAY!   Are you kidding me?  Fish tacos are their specialty on Tuesdays - the sauce is so unique and yummy.   

Other days I've gone I've enjoyed taco salads and if really hungry a monster burrito.  

Authentic is the best word to describe Salsa Cabana - owners always on site and always happy to accommodate.  You must go if you haven't been already."}
{"text":"We found this place thanks to a coupon from the Entertainment Book.
We had gone to the area for a special occasion and wanted to have dinner on the way home.
We didn't think much of this place initially as it is a tiny location, and you order at the counter.
However, the staff was very friendly and accommodating to our special requests. I had a green chile plate as I was trying to avoid tortillas. Hubby had a chicken chimichanga.

I liked very much how they presented my food, and also that they use real plates, very big, nice and colorful plates.

We did like the complimentary chips and salsa.

I think they did charge us a fee for paying with credit card, but we didn't mind because their prices are very reasonable.

Also, I did love that they had 'low carb' tortilla options in their menu. That is what got them the 5th star : )"}
{"text":"This place is a gem.  4.5 stars.  I have driven by many times without stopping.  It surprised me how good it was.  Very fresh and authentic, hole in the wall type of place, complete with the mix and match chairs and tables.  The menu on the wall with pictures of the entrees and hand written specials taped up all over the place.  Reminds me of the little taco shops near the border in San Diego.  
I ordered the steak chimi and it was great.  The chunks of steak were very tender and flavorful and it had just the right amount of refried beans inside and was topped with a ribbon of sourcream and guac as well as fresh chopped tomato, green onion, cilantro, and cheese....all in the right amounts.  Chips were still warm from being cooked.  Only negative was I like getting salsa in a small dish, and they hand you two tubes (one red and one green....green was best I thought).  So you basically squeeze some on each chip instead of dipping.  Will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"Delicious grilled fish tacos, beans and rice. Little salsa bar, so you can get your own fixings. A bowl of free tortilla chips while you wait for your meal. And, I really like Minute Maid Lite Lemonade and they had it! Great service and your food is served on a real plate, not a paper plate or styrofoam. This is authentic Mexican food. I will be back."}
{"text":"We've been going here for at least 5 years now. Consistently good and great value. We would go more often if it were closer. The people have always been friendly, too."}
{"text":"After reading the yelp reviews I decided I needed to have fish tacos at Salsa Cabana Mexican Grill. Ordered to go, and was packed a nice serving of tortilla chips which are just the way I like, light, fresh and crisp. There is a salsa bar with a good selection. My fish taco was delicious. Probably going to be my go to place for fish tacos now. Good service, friendly, clean. Can't wait to go back and try more."}
{"text":"People with allergies BEWARE!
I ordered my lunch with no guacamole. I informed the lady of my avocado allergy. When the plate was served to me they had a big dollop of guac on it. As the same lady placed it in front of me I reminded her of my allergy. She apologized and brought it back to the kitchen/cooking area (visible to all customers). I heard her say to remove the guac and wipe it off. I in turn stood up and went to the counter and again reiterated that I HAD AN ALLERGY! I needed a new plate and fresh food. Not the same plate and not the same food that had been contaminated by the avocado. She looked at me and acknowledged and nodded her head at the cook and told the cook to make a new plate. They all acted like they had just been inconvenienced. I felt I had to stand there and watch to make sure they didn't scoop the old food onto a new plate. This restaurant is under new ownership. I sure do miss the husband and wife that owned it before. They were more courteous and grateful towards their customers. Should be a 1 star for threatening my health. But I gave them 2 stars because I like the condiment bar that they added to the restaurant. It was a nice touch."}
{"text":"Excellent eats... no fanfare accomodations but it was clean and friendly."}
{"text":"From out of town. This a great place to get Authentic Mexican food.  Delicious food, great service. Bomb Nachos!!!!!"}
{"text":"Damn good Mexican food. In fact best I've ever had and I eat a lot of it. I had Soft chicken taco and red Tamale with rice and beans. Do yourself a favor and eat here."}
{"text":"Small little place. Came in wanting street tacos & they had the best!!! Very friendly service as well! Ordered the fried ice cream for dessert & it was incredible!!!! Will definitely go back!!! yummy"}
{"text":"My husband and I have been going to Salsa Cabana for the past four years. I have recommended them to several people as their food was great. We mainly went on Sunday night as there was a man that worked there by himself every Sunday. He also worked at Rosatis he was awesome. Since he left half the time the are closed on Sunday it is hit or miss but tonight was the worst. We walked in at 6:25 (they close at 7 it says on the door) and before I can reach the. counter in front of customers who are eating a man yells out to us we are closed and like hand motions cutting his throat . BAD BUSINESS PRACTICES."}
{"text":"Delicious food, really authentic. The beans and rice were really tasty and the fish tacos we're out of this world. The cabbage was chopped up really small, and the sauce that came on it was yummy. Highly recommend checking this place out!"}
{"text":"Stopped on the corner looking for something fast! Found this little gem! Under new ownership, they made me a delicious steak burrito meal! Excellent friendly Ma and Pa service! Only $5.99! I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Took the family here tonight after checking the reviews on Yelp. Wow! The food is so delicious and good quality. Relaxed atmosphere with Jackie Chan movie on the TV that was not too loud or too quiet and cabana style seating outdoors. Beer and margaritas are an option but we weren't drinking tonight. Service was great and staff friendly and make you feel right at home. We ate in and food was served on real plates brought right to your table! It was affordable and prices are more than fair for price and quality of food/service. We will be going back."}
{"text":"Nice place to go for a quick sit-down lunch.  The lunch special (changes daily) is always a good deal and will be extremely filling.  For example, two enchiladas (LARGE ones), rice and beans can be $4.95 with a soda bringing you to $6 and change after tax.  Not bad if you aren't in the mood for drive through or a longer meal at Tia Rosa's.  They'll usually give you chips and salsa too while the owner/cook is at work.  

Standard fare of tacos, enchiladas, burritos throwing it some fajitas and chile rellono too.   The chorizo wasn't too greasy either so thats always a plus in my book.

Not bad for an extremely filling lunch break.  They've started serving beers too with a $2 Corona, Tecate, etc. Happy Hour."}
{"text":"Can you say...Taco Tuesday?! This place has the closest thing to an authentic Mexican fish taco I've ever had. Generous portions of super flavorful mahi and the works. And I don't know what they put in their taco sauce but oh. my. god. We're talking some magical stuff here ya'll. Best tacos I've ever had for $1.50 each on Taco Tuesday? Shut the front door. Lets just say I'm a regular."}
{"text":"This is my favorite spot since I've moved to Mesa! My hubby and I have absolutely loved everything we've tried from the chimichangas, tamales, tacos, burritos, & the salsa bar!!! And the customer service is in point every time!! It's a battle to not  eat there everyday."}
{"text":"Perfectly picoso. Even the pickled onions were spicy and so dang tasty. For such a small place the salsa bar was pretty stocked and diverse. I got the street tacos. Small but stuffed and topped with pics and cheese. Carnitas were nice and tender but the shrimp was the star. Not over cooked and topped with a good crema sauce. Did I mention the onions!!! Cheap too. Three filling tacos and a big bottle of water $8. REALLY CLEAN TOO. my ofc is near by so I should be a Duke here soon.
Update: came in for Taco Tuesday , and the fish taco did not disappoint. One was filling. Great tasting and meaty for a fish taco."}
{"text":"Great Place.  The taco's are superb!  The service is great and the staff is friendly.  I'll be back; next time with an entourage. Special recognition goes to the fish taco!"}
{"text":"I love their fish Tacos, probably the best I have ever had!!
plus I'm always greeted very nicely and the couple the own and manage the place are very sweet and nice.
Highly recommend it for lunch or dinner, too bad I live 20 minutes away in Tempe, Still worth the drive I do to go there once every 2 weeks or so, just can't stay away!"}
{"text":"Found this place in a strip mall and was pleasantly surprised. Prices were reasonable   Service was fast. The salsas were very good. Chips were a bit stale and I would have liked a little more sour cream and guacamole with my fajitas but all in all very pleased. I will go back!"}
{"text":"Decided to try this place out based on the ratings.  Omg so good the ratings don't lie.  I had the chicken chimichanga.  So delicious!"}
{"text":"This is an awesome place. A hidden gem. The service is above and beyond, making you feel like they care. The food here is one of the better places I have been to lately. I will be bringing my family to eat here when they visit. Very clean and cheerful, great food-what more could you ask for?"}
{"text":"Came here again at around when it opened. I ordered 2 fish tacos and a chiles rellenos. It took around 7 minutes so not too bad. The fish tacos were alright. Fairly good, but definitely not the best I've had. I would probably get the fish tacos again. The chile rellenos really wasn't good. I've never had one before but I always understood them to be battered in egg whites and deep fried. The chile relleno here was made basically with a charred chile stuffed with cheese inside a slightly overlooked omelet. Literally just an omelet, I saw the cook make it. As for the chips I thought were really tasty last time, they were stale, bland, and cold."}
{"text":"I love this place. I've been here over 100 times. They have the best value lunch special you can buy and the food is delicious. I usually get the chimichanga."}
{"text":"My fave place for fish tacos, taco Tuesday here really kicks it up.  Nice people running it, support small business!"}
{"text":"Love this place.... The chips are Devine.  I usually just get a bean and cheese burrito + chips and salsa.  Highly recommend"}
{"text":"This is a wonderful little neighborhood Mexican place. They have a nice variety on their menu and fish taco Tuesday is $1.75 a taco which is a great deal. Also different flavors of margaritas and a friendly little atmosphere."}
{"text":"First time here & the food is AMAZING! They take their 'delicious' seriously. 
The restaurant is very clean & tidy as well. 
 Super nice people too. I'll definately be a regular here."}
{"text":"Best mexican food in mesa by far! Im from california and have been looking for a place for great tacos and this is it! I cant stand how other places shred ALL OF THEIR MEAT!! This place is nice and quiet and the food is amazing."}
{"text":"Love salsa cabana! Lunch specials are great thie is a great hole in the wall Mexican. Food place! Everything I've tried has been awesome! The owners are always there and couldn't be nicer!"}
{"text":"Wow.  This is an excellent stop for Mexican food.  It's not just a taqueria, the chile relleno was among the best we've had and the carne asada tasted just like we were in Mexico.  It's a little walk-up-to-order place, but the dining area is very clean and colorful.  There is a nice salsa bar and they have stuffed churros which are very hard to find outside of Mexico.  We will be back."}
{"text":"My sister and I stopped in here for lunch for the first time. The employees were very helpful and knew the menu well. I asked for my veggie burro without a tortilla and they were happy to accommodate and it was delicious! They also informed me they don't use lard in their beans, which is a plus in my opinion.
The veggie burro was a lunch special item, it came with a drink, rice and beans, all for $5.50. They also gave us complimentary chips and salsa. I would definitely go back. I've heard good things about their fish tacos, Id like to try them next!"}
{"text":"\"Best horchata in Mesa !\"

That's the claim of the hospitable hostess slash waitress slash cashier.

\"It's made from scratch, not a mix\", she says to bolster her point.

Me, I'm no expert on horchatas (or much of anything for that matter), but it's one of the best I've ever had anywhere. For curiosity sake I did try another horchata in Mesa and while it was good you could taste some graininess. 

Go for the large size, trust me.

In addition to excellent horchatas the food is delicious and affordable.
A good size entree with rice, beans and salad for $5.75 ?
A pretty sweet deal.
I had the fish tacos (very good), the beef enchilada (excellent). A generous portion given the price. I had light dinners after eating this for lunch.

It seems that two people do everything here and are quite hospitable and sincere. While making claims of how great the horchata was it came across as less of a brag and more of a statement of pride.  

A great, casual Mexican restaurant with amazing lunch specials.."}
{"text":"Best fish tacos in Arizona! Nice people. Easy location to get to"}
{"text":"Ate there for the first time last night with my family we eat out quite a bit and always keep our expectations low. We saw this  place in Google and decided to take a risk. I'm glad we did the food was great hot fresh tasty the salsa bar had a good variety with jalapeños cucumbers and limes. The chips were also good. Laura got the shrimp tacos was delicious I got a shredded hardshell taco bean burrito with red sauce and a red tamale all wonderful the beans and rice also were delicious I will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"4.5 Stars for me. This is my favorite place for fish tacos in AZ (That I've tried). They have this sauce that I don't know what they put in it, I just know I love it. I've tried a couple other things as well and they were also good, but I have a hard time ordering anything other than the fish tacos, because I just can't get enough of them. Delicious."}
{"text":"First time to this restaurant.  The resturant was clean and we were greeted at the counter to order.  The food was out fast and it was fresh. My husband ordered the red chili burrito which was loaded with meat. I ordered the two shredded beef taco plate. The shredded beef was good and the red chili meat was also good. 
Expect to pay about 10.00 each plus your2.00 drink.  
Overall good food and authentic tasting. We will be back soon."}
{"text":"This place is great - I'm Mex/American AZ native. This is the best Mexican food outside of my hometown!! The rice tastes like my mom's and that was her specialty. It is always clean and friendly. We come here at least 2x a week. The $6.50 single item special with drink can't be beat!!"}
{"text":"I ordered the veggie burrito and it was great! Oh and get horchata... it's made fresh and absolutely delicious. So affordable too."}
{"text":"I have to say I was pleasantly surprised at this place. Yelp reviews convinced me to try it out. Food was very good. Tortillas tasted fresh and homemade. The pork carnitas was very tasty, as was the veggie burro. Only complaint was we showed up with the lunch rush and had to wait nearly 30 min for our food. Will be back."}
{"text":"Small place with a few tables, nothing fancy. But the food is great and plenty of it!  Order at the counter and they bring the food to your table. Free chips and salsa. Friendly staff too. Definitely a place I'd stop in again."}
{"text":"Meh, its okay. Nice people , salsas were both excellent , the red enchilada sauce is very good, after that it was mmmmm"}
{"text":"This place was great, a small hole in the wall with friendly service and yummy food. They make their burritos to order, so it was easy to leave out any dairy to make it vegan. Also, when we went they were having happy hour margaritas and they are hand made! Yum."}
{"text":"We were really excited when we saw the rating and how close it was to us. Needless to say, it was a definite disappointment. Food is ok, and the people are nice --- but that doesn't deserve 5 stars, or even 4. Average, edible food - but NOTHING special. There are at LEAST 3 other small Mexican food places in the area much better."}
{"text":"Delicious! We had the fish tacos. They were so amazing. The chips and salsa were great too. We'll be back... OFTEN!"}
{"text":"Everything was extremely fresh from the corn tortillas tomatoes fish tacos. It's a little hole in the wall but definitely a hidden gem! I had the fish tacos and a bean tostada. Even the tortilla chips tasted homemade and fresh. I would definitely recommend and definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Incredible! If you're looking for knock-your-socks-off Mexican food, look no further! My fiance and I love the fish tacos, nachos, quesadillas and chile rellano.

The 'other' mexican place next door is total junk. Don't waste your time."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing! Make sure you make the most out of the special on fish tacos on Taco Tuesday because they are almost too good to be true. They cater to gluten free really well; even the tamales and the enchiladas are made from just corn tortillas. The people are lovely, and they play Latin music for extra authenticity ;)"}
{"text":"I love this place!  It is located in the same center as Tia Rosa.  Most people are unaware of this little gem and bypass it for the \"other guy\".  I would recommend giving this place a try.  You might be surprised."}
{"text":"It is so close to us and we finally went there after reading all of the very good reviews.  We were absolutely not disappointed. The place is very clean, excellent service with a smile and the food was spot on. I had the chili relleno plate and my wife had the California burrito. Flavors were great. The salsa bar was clean and had multiple options. This place is sure to be a regular spot for us now."}
{"text":"Not quite sure it's up to the hubbub that the 5* reviews are giving. Solid \"hole-in-the-wall\" type place. Although I didn't feel like everything was amazingly fresh and \"authentico\" it was cool to order a giant veggie burrito.  My daughter seemed to like her carne asada tacos.

If you're in the area and want a Mexican nibble - try it."}
{"text":"Small, family owned local restaurant with the best Mexican food in the area.  The lunch specials are amazing with lots to choose from and the owners and staff are super friendly and helpful. This a fun and casual place to eat and one of my go to places to bring family and friends."}
{"text":"We came here on New Year's Eve and it was delicious. I ordered a chimichanga and couldn't have been happier"}
{"text":"If you are looking for a whole in the wall Mexican place that serves fresh and authentic food located in the East Valley, Salsa Cabana is a great place.  I would recommend coming here for lunch as they have amazing lunch specials of $4.95, which comes with chips and salsa and a drink.  I got the chicken tacos with rice and beans.  It was a perfect sized portion for lunch.  The chicken was white meat and fresh.  They have a tomatillo green salsa and fire-red hot salsa.  

I usually do not put a big weight on drinks, but they have mango infused tea.  The tea was very refreshing and tasty.  It is all natural with no sugar.  The tea gives it the 5th star.

My friend got the chicken enchiladas, and they looked yummy.  I will have to order cheese or chicken enchiladas next time, yum!"}
{"text":"Very good. We ventured in due to the yelp reviews and it was very good. It has a small dining area. You order at the counter and they bring food out. Good salsa bar, good $7.50 special that you choose the main item and get a drink too. The rice is very good. The burritos are large. If I lived here, we'd stop by regularly. The margaritas looked good."}
