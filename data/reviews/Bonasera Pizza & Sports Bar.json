{"text":"I have been a customer for years because of location, the food is generally good and the renos are nice but its time to renovate the staff.
 The servers are slow, bored and complacent. Im sorry but this family has gotten my last dollar. The area has other places with similar menu but better staff."}
{"text":"Bonasera is a neighourhood pub and restaurant that is nothing more than what it is. I've been there a few times and as far as the cheap wings on Tuesdays go, the place is just fine. The wings are good and come in a variety of flavours. The Greek ones are particularly good.
One night we were still hungry after a few cans of Guinness and wings and ordered a pizza. That's when Bonasera fell apart. There was no sauce on the goddamn thing. After we objected, the rough-and-tumble waitress brought us a cup of cold marinara sauce. It was a nightmare. How can you have the word pizza in your name and not even know how to make it properly?
If you find yourself there for reasons beyond your control, stick with the wings...."}
{"text":"I have been here a few times and service is quite mediocre. I came here after work to play some pool with a fellow worker. I sat down at a table and waited for a waitress but no one came to greet me for about 10 minutes so I decided to go to the bar because I was thirsty gave her $7 for my $5.65 beer not even a thank you for my tip. So my friend showed up a little afterwards and the waitress was there immediately, maybe a little racist? Btw I'm Vietnamese LOL. My friend is Caucasian and the service got significantly better haha"}
{"text":"Cheap beer, great pizza, almost always great service. 
Plus darts and pool. What's not to like?"}
{"text":"Service is horrible!! We have waited over 45 min for a small pizza and 12 wings.. Three tables next to us have already eaten and paid their bill and we were here way before them."}
{"text":"I had take-out from here for a meeting in the area. I didn't know what to expect but based on location and the look of the exteriour, I figured it was one of those traditional old school little neighbourhood places that no one outside of the 'hood knows exists but does a solid job at some things.

And I was right. We had lasagna, Cesar salad and garlic Texas toast. It was all pretty good, in a \"not good for you\" take out way. The toast was bright yellow with a hint of garlic. The lasagna had a ton of cheese and a weird spice profile that tasted okay but kept me guessing as to what I was tasting throughout the meal. The salad was also \"okay\" but nothing to write home about. The portions though were quite substantial for the money paid.

Would I come back here ? Probably not, unless I needed something easy and was in the area. There aren't a lot of options around and they did a solid job which probably makes them a good local spot."}
{"text":"Hi on wing night the wings are cheap , 2people can eat for under $20. The wings are lower quality usually smallish but the price matches On a busy night they will come ask you to change tables  if your at a 4 place table and there is just 2 of you . People have had steak dinners and been moved I witnessed that ,was shocked and the patron wasn't impressed either. In 2015 I haven't been there yet even though I only live steps away August now . I once went in for wings and they were small and very browned like a refry eat 2 or 3 sent them back and they prorated my change  .  Lmao"}
{"text":"Chose Bonasera based on the 89% review on Urbanspoon.

I am 89% sure that either 89% of reviewers haven't actually tasted the food, or they haven't tried 89% of the other better choices for pizza in the area. 

Delivered,  the pepperoni pizza we ordered was expensive compared to other pizza parlours nearby, I don't normally make price an issue,  but dollar for dollar we were left unimpressed. 

Crust was sub par,  but the \"pepperoni\" and I use the term loosely, was the best - if your into \"meat\"  that I can best describe as tasting like boiled hot dogs - and not the delicious Costco dogs,  but those ones made of snouts and udders you get for three bucks a pack. 

Speaking of costco,  I had a Costco pizza earlier in the week,  it was 89% less money and 89% better than Bonasera. 

Won't be ordering here again."}
{"text":"The wings here are really good and on Tuesdays they're 10 cents. The one time I got baked potato skins, they would have been good if they werent burnt :(... The service was really horrible to start, but since coming there a couple times it seems they have hired on more staff. I actually really love this pub though!"}
{"text":"Bonnie has some great pizza on a Monday and fast friendly service. Lots of dart boards and pool tables"}
{"text":"Best pizza and lasagna! Friendly,clean. Wing night cheap,good.
Been going there for 20 years!.
Met my husband there! Lol 
Good people!"}
{"text":"We go to this bar after our coed soccer games for beer (and sometimes food). Beer is usually cheap and does the job. Thursday nights $4 Bonasera beer & $8 pizza, lasagna, spaghetti. Not bad for the price. They only sell beer by the glass/bottle, no jugs."}
{"text":"Great place.  Food is great and the atmosphere is friendly and chill. Vlt machines, pool tables and darts."}
{"text":"2 stars:
Let me lists the reasons:
1.) The wings are good...small but OK $2 with a drink on tuesdays.

2) the service SUCKS!
3.) The servers overworked maybe..  They aren't friendly at All and they are very much stressed out.
4.) Did I meantion it took them an hour to get my friends order out! Yah and its the wrong one! 
5.) I didn't feel safe inside. Good thing there were 10 of us."}
