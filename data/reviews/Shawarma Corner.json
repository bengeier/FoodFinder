{"text":"My review that I posted on April 28th 2013 was removed by the site 

Here is is again 
Just walked into this restaurant. Horrible service. The employee or owner was too busy cutting the chicken that he didn't even acknowledge us. We waited for a few minutes to give this place a chance but after losing our patience we walked out. Off to burrito boyz"}
{"text":"Best Shawarma in town. Portion size is large and I love their Pita sauce"}
{"text":"This place has the best chicken hands down of any shawarma place in Brampton or Mississauga. Don't know what the person who said the chicken is sitting in oil is talking about, I've never seen this in my many trips to this place. I've never been there when it's busy so I got served quickly and never had my order screwed up when I got there. And the guys behind the counter aren't so bad if you get to know them ;-)"}
{"text":"I have been here a few times only because it is the closest shawarma restaurant from my work.  Each experience has been atrocious.  The gentleman who works there (assuming the owner) is impolite and unaccommodating.  The shawarma is dry and the gyro sits in warm water all day and is nearly tasteless. On two of the three occasions I have been charged the wrong amount.  Avoid this restaurant.  There are much better shawarma places a little further down the street."}
{"text":"This place is pretty good. I have been a couple of times, and the food is fresh and tasty, but some of the toppings aren't made in a style I like as much as some other shawarma places. Nothing big.. just the hummus and the turnip bits are sometimes not there. That said -- I have been here more than once and return again. The person behind the counter both times wasn't terribly friendly, though he was efficient enough. I Would avoid this spot if you demand friendly, smiley service, but other than that, it's recommended."}
{"text":"3.5 rating

This place is a bit hit and miss - or more accurately hit and near-miss since I've never had too off of an experience, though they're not always fully consistent.

Usually the chicken is quite fresh, and cut off of the spit for each order, and having a nice crisp on it. Once or twice, it was a bit too crispy and overcooked though. Typically it's pretty good and they do put in a huge amount.

They don't have a lot of choices for toppings, though most of the staples are there. I actually really enjoy their purple cabbage which has dill in it, which a nice unique take on it. I also like that their hot sauce is tasty and legitimately very hot. I'd be tempted to bump the rating to a 4 if their hummus was better than ordinary. They do offer laffa which is a nice option.

Fairly run-down space, albeit clean enough in the dinning area. Service isn't really with a smile, but is functional.

I don't think I've ordered anything outside of a wrap, so I can't really comment on the platters."}
{"text":"Best f-ing chicken shawarma plate in the GTA. Amazing combination of salads. The chicken is crispy and soft both at the same time! And its only $10 with taxes included. I can only eat half a plate...so lots of leftovers. Been coming here religiously for the past 3 years. Go try them!"}
{"text":"SUPER JUCIY SHAWARMA! I come here at least twice a month with my whole family. We always have a big order. The shawarma is always juicy, consistent and BIG. All the toppings are very fresh. Employees are very nice and ready to help. I RECOMEND THIS SPOT TO ALL."}
{"text":"I came to get take out of shawarma platter. They offer rice, potatoes, salad, and meat of your choice. Didn't get a good look at the menu it's behind the counter, but typical shawarma place with added burgers. 

They do not cheap out on the portion, it could be your lunch and dinner. The only reason i gave it 3 stars was because the chicken was already cut up waiting to be served in an oil sauce that was too greasy for me, I like it when the meat is shaved infront of me and not put in oil, as well as the rice, it was poured with oil, it cooked and tasted great if there wasn't 2 tablespoons of oil on it. Decrease the oil use and the food would be perfect."}
{"text":"Ordered food for a party from them. Service was friendly.  Good prices. Portions were HUGE. The food was ok.. chicken shawarma dinner was good,  Gyro was ok, falafel were tasty... they forgot to give me the hummus I ordered.. pita bread nothing special but then again I had no dip to use it with.."}
{"text":"Bang for Buck maybe Brampton's best easily.

Taste is ok to good. The size's are HUGE and the toppings are great variety. 

If you haven't been I recommend.. 

Area is little dirty but if you are hungry and want to be full for under 8 bones.. This is your place 100%"}
{"text":"We got the chicken shawarma dinner at this joint. Chicken is pretty good but the rest is not impressive at all. The rice was dry, the salad tasted old and you don't get the traditional potatoes or pita with the dinner.

The service was super slow and not welcoming."}
{"text":"This is the best shawarma ever. I have the shawarma salad with the cabbage and the meat itself is amazing. They give you big portion sizes. I travel far just to get Shawarma Corner"}
{"text":"I'd like to give this place 5 stars but the service here is almost hit and miss. Even on the best days, you don't feel like you are appreciated as a regular customer.

If the food wasn't that great I wouldn't come but their chicken shwarma plate is the best I've tried. In terms of sides and stuff like that, they are alright but they are pretty set in what comes with what dish. Other places I've been to let you customize it as much as you like, especially if you are a regular.

Definitely try this place for good chicken shwarma but don't expect the best service."}
{"text":"My hubby brought me home a chicken shawarma plate from this restaurant so this review is not based on the customer service although he said the guy that was working there was very friendly and that the establishment was very clean.

I personally did not enjoy the food. The rice had no taste and the chicken shawarma did not have much taste to it either. I am a BIG LOVER of hot sauces, all kinds of hot sauces but for some reason their hot sauce made my stomach turn in ways I'm not use to.

It was very overpowering to the foods that were on my plate and eventually became unbearable to finish the dish.

I am of Egyptian decent and this food did not come across as middle eastern at all but more like a concoction of different things thrown together.  

Unfortunately I will not be returning..."}
{"text":"Solid amount of chicken and best tasting rice and potatoes out of any shawarma shop in Brampton I've had. The potato sauce can make the plate quite greasy so I like to tell em no sauce with the potatoes. None the less, top 5 shawarma spot in Brampton easily"}
