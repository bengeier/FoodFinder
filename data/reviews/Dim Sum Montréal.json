{"text":"Definitely worth the price One of the most Reasonable priced truck with delicious food. Tried their best seller, their shrimp and pork dumplings and it was incredible. Looked more like 2 gigantic meatballs but amazing food for price  Highly recommended for next season"}
{"text":"If i could give this place more than 5 stars, I would. So delicious. Got to discover this food truck when they stopped at the Nuns Island fair on Sunday. Decided to try them on a whim and it was so worth it. I got the shrimp and pork dumplings. They were tasty and juicy. Prepared in 5 minutes. I also got a Ice Tea to accompany it and it was heavenly.    I really really enjoyed these."}
{"text":"Tried the siu mai and bubble tea from here.  The siu mai was very good and each one was probably double normal size with a nice big shrimp on top. It seemed to using more meat than fat, which is not so common these days.  I also had the lychee bubble tea.   While there wasn't much lychee flavour, it had less ice than normal plus a strong tea flavour.  I actually quite enjoyed it. I would call it a blend of HK style tea (served cold) with tapioca and lychee. It was quite good (and popular as there was a lineup of 10 people when we arrived).  Overall, if you are into food trucks, I recommend you check these guys out."}
{"text":"As someone who loves Dim Sum I was excited when I came across the food truck at a random street fair. Paid $4.50 for a couple bites of coleslaw salad and two dumplings. Although I wish it had been a slightly larger serving, I have to say that their dumplings are SPOT ON. Perfect portions and just so darn delicious."}
{"text":"Went to this food truck for lunch. The pork & shrimp dumplings were alright. Also took the bbq pork buns, almost no filling, bland taste. the food did not look like how it was pictures on the menu. The salad was just a leaf of boston with a very sweet dressing. I would not recommend."}
{"text":"Juicy, meaty and delicious. The biggest shrimp siu mai I've ever seen and so wonderfully flavourful. The BBQ pork bun was also ridiculously good - very meaty and little fat (a rarity these days).  Didn't try the bubble tea but my friend loved hers!  Overall, 5-star"}
{"text":"My second time to the Dim Sum truck was very disappointing. I ordered the shrimp and pork dumplings, steamed pork bun, mango bubble tea and coco perle. The shrimp and pork were alright - large, juicy and served hot, but they are served in the same tray as the salad. The hot salad with sweet dressing was disgusting by the time I got back to the office to eat it. The pork buns were hard and cold. I couldn't eat them. The coco perle that I loved so much the first time I had them were not chewy at all. They were nuked in the micro wave before serving them to me and became hard - very hard, almost crumbly. I couldn't eat it. Total disappointment. The bubble tea was warm - no ice and flavourless. It was the colour of mango bubble tea but was watery and really no flavour. There were about 6 bubbles (tapico pearls) in the drink total. Bummer. Lunch cost me $20. I feel really ripped off."}
{"text":"I always take \"assorted dimsum package\" cuz I can't pick one dimsum here. Literally EVERY DIMSUM is awesome!!   When I live near McGill, I used to go there twice a week. Moreover the owner is so kind! I miss this truck so much!"}
