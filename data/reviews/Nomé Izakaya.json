{"text":"Great place to eat always get treated very well and they're always changing the menu you can't go wrong with anything you pick to eat and the oysters on Tuesday and Wednesday are at a great price the only problem I have there is that it's a little too small"}
{"text":"Went with my girlfriend for dinner and it was perfect, got the oyster, mix sashimi, beef ribs and drinks. Food came at a reasonable time, sashimi was kinda fresh and oysters were amazing. Service was great but always make a reservation. Would recommend and go again. 1 star off because not enough skewer menu and tables are kinda close to each other with no barriers. Not a big deal."}
{"text":"I used to love this place, but now need to reconsider!!!  So sad to find out their yellow (conditional) inspection. Number of infractions: 8 (Minor: 1, Significant: 5, Crucial: 2) Crucial infractions includes: employee failed to wash hands when required and operator failed to ensure food is not contaminated/adulterated.  Not washing hands? Yikes! I'm not sure how many germs I've consumed. They hired hot waitresses, they should also provide sanitation information to their employee."}
{"text":"A very cozy Izakaya.  Went there on Tuesday  for the special oysters. Fresh and tasty. We also ordered the large size sashimi. It's ok, no surprise. Only comes with salmon, tuna, oysters. We had two rolls which were really delicious, salmon and tuna ones. House special burger is juicy and tasty. You can't go wrong with it! I love the deep ford pork belly. Not greasy at all!"}
{"text":"I came here for a friends birthday. The food was just ok. Service is pretty slow and I find this place a little over prices for the quality. It's worth a try if you have never been here but it's really one try only."}
{"text":"Overall 3.5/5 Been here a couple times now for the oyster special on Tues and Wed. Selection seems to sell out quick, and both times I've usually ended up with the fanny bay and malpeque oysters. Not a oyster aficionado so cant say much. But i enjoy the wide range of sauces that comes with the order.  Overall I enjoy the food. Some items that stand out to me would be: Tiger shrimp, Sashimi Salad, Kara-age, Japa burger, Monkfish tacos, and the seared salmon dishes (I believe there are two). I definitely would recommend ordering stuff that cleans the palette because the flavours can get pretty intense if you order a lot from the fried, grilled, or chef suggestions stuff.  Don't really know much about drinks, just usually have a beer there if anything. But a friend ordered one of their mixed frosty drinks and it did not look worth it at all.  The really big drawback of this place is the atmosphere. Personally I can't stand top 40 radio music, and this place plays the worst of the worst. I've had good and bad experiences with the noise level. A fair warning is this place can get obnoxiously loud, but I think this might depend on where your table is, and of course the people there. But when there is someone right behind or beside you cackling as loud as possible and you gotta yell just to communicate with people in your table, it kinda kills my vibe.  Lastly can't say anything bad about the service. Food comes in a reasonable time; finished dishes gets taken away quickly; no harassment level check-ups; and its all done within a walkway thats probably less than 1m in width."}
{"text":"Probably the coolest uptown spot.  I'll keep this short and sweet. They're a newer place but definitely here to stay. What the uptown area needs. A cool spot with lots of life and energy. The food is innovative and trendy fusion as well as verrry tasty. Unlike most izakaya they have domestic alcohol choices which I prefer. An all around fun spot to have a great relatively inexpensive meal, great drinks and music.  Since the day I discovered this place I've frequented it on a regular basis. It's the perfect vibe and such a great location. Highly recommended you can't go wrong!!"}
{"text":"Came here on a Sunday night around 6. It wasn't busy yet but it was definitely busy by the time we left (around 8). we ordered: shrimp udon salad, sashimi salad, double salmon roll, Ebi-mayo, takoyaki, baked oysters, and japa-burgers. I really enjoyed the shrimp udon salad. The vinaigrette was unique and and udon noodles were perfectly cooked. Also, the shrimp pieces were large and juicy. I thought the sashimi salad was meh. Tasted like regular sashimi tossed in a salad and some dressing. The double salmon roll was nice. It was unique and didn't taste like the typical rolls. The smoked salmon has a distinct flavour if you're into smoked salmon. Ebi-mayo was so delicious. The chip was perfect, and the shrimp was perfectly fried and tasty. Takoyaki was good! It's standard and its rare to find a bad tasting takoyaki in my opinion. Baked oysters were great, the oysters tasted fresh and it was not overbaked at all. And finally, I was a bit disappointed by the japa-burger, due to the many positive reviews. They came out not as warm as I would like, and it was so normal tasting-- a little burger with some japanese style mayo. Will not order that next time. All in all, i liked the atmosphere. It's not the usual loud rowdy yelling-when-anyone-walks-in type of Japanese restaurant. Those atmospheres are great, but not when you want to have an actual conversation. Also, the seating is pretty comfy here. Service was super fast and good. Also, they got my mother a complimentary birthday cake with a large sparkler, which I appreciated a lot! All in all, tasty food, cool atmosphere, and nice service: would come again."}
{"text":"Ended up going here for Sat night dinner since the wait for a table at GUU was too long. Luckily enough, we got the last table available but was limited to an hour since there had reservation guests coming it at a later time.   Food was great - faves included Mac and Cheese which came with scallops; Unagi Risotto, Spicy Sashimi Tortilla Bites  Found the food a little pricier than GUU since the portions seemed a bit small. Dining is small, intimate and loud but fun.   Would love to come back to try the oyster special on the weekday!"}
{"text":"Yummy food, cool music, super attractive waitresses.   Love the Jappa Burger"}
{"text":"I like this place a lot! I have been twice now and food is excellent...I didn't think their oysters were that great though...didn't taste very fresh.   The first time I went was on a busy Friday night and I think we were pretty lucky to get a seat at the bar, however, the place is crazy loud. Staff were very pleasant and we ordered quite a few dishes....I highly recombined their home made chips and their sliders. Delicious! They are made in this delicious something sauce that I love! We also had the fish taco which only meh. Overall great!  The second time we went was around 6pm and it was fairy quiet and noise level was a lot better...I guess the full on DJ set hadn't started yet. We tried the oysters this time which as I said above were only ok. Again had chips and sliders, awesome! I was disappointed in the staff this time who seemed to be ignoring us a lot. Even when we came in, the place was pretty empty and the waitresses would look at us standing by the door and then go off and do something else... weird. Eventually we were seated but no one really wanted anything to do with us and it was a constant struggle to get served and even when we asked for something (chopsticks, napkin etc) we were either ignored or they just forgot about what we asked. We were the only non-asians in the place so maybe this had something to dow with it?   Oh second time we also tried some of their cocktails which were fab! AND omg they have a raspberry cheesecake that is to die for !!  I would definitely go again and hopefully staff will be nicer to us."}
{"text":"A spot I will come back to again and again. Great service, bustling atmosphere, drinks and a great spin on some fusion foods, served izakaya style. I am a sucker for the bulgogi tacos and you have to try the honey bread dessert at least once! Sake is normally my staple there but they're also pretty well equipped with any other beers, wines, liquors as well. And let's not forget about the $1 oyster nights! They've also recently opened a rooftop patio. Weekends tend to be quite busy so it doesn't hurt to get there early or to make a reservation."}
{"text":"Amazing collection of food! Beef short ribs, fried shrimp, tacos, sashimi salad, and even Mac and cheese! Great ambience!"}
{"text":"Went last Friday night for our 4 year anniversary. After making a reservation, we were seated immediately. The service was fantastic! The food even better! And at the end of it all, they remembered that I had told them it was our anniversary and they brought over a delicious piece of Cheesecake Factory Cake, for free! We were very full by the end of the meal and after two cocktails and 5 shared platters.. it only cost us around $65! Great for a dinner night out with a fun music ambiance. Great job! We'll see you again soon!"}
{"text":"Went there on a Wednesday for a buck a shuck on oysters. It was reallly packed and about an hour wait. The place wasnt spacious cobsidering the wait line was out the door. Music was good but a little too loud for conversations. Staffs were running all over the place and there was only one hostess working. Overall, the food was bomb. We ordered 2 dozens of oysters, octopus balls, chips and Japa burgers. It was the best experience of my life. The food was great and unlike anything I've ever tasted, especially the japa burgers. Oysters were set on a nice bed of ice, and the octopus balls had a nice flavour to it. I would really recommend this place and will be planning a visit back."}
{"text":"Good food, well priced! I love their a buck a shuck deal and service is always on point :)"}
{"text":"I have been there many times. I especially like the place because of its Tuesdays and Wednesdays 1 dollar oyster special offer. it's a great place to have a drink and catch up with your friends. it's not too noisy compared to other izakaya places I have been to, so that's a bonus for me."}
{"text":"Great decor, helpful and friendly staff, although service could be a little faster. To be fair we came in on a busy night. My boyfriend had the mini-burgers and I had the squid with some oysters on the side and everything was great! The burgers weren't dry at all as the minis usually are, and the oysters came with a range of mini sauces so you can decide how to flavour them. I'm a fan of chewy foods so squid cooked anyhow makes my day but this one was pretty special tasting. The oysters were also clearly fresh"}
{"text":"Love this place!  My husband and I go often and have ever been disappointed.  Service has been impeccable and love that there's always good music playing.  Oysters, JapaBurgers, and Bulgogi Tacos are our go-tos, and have enjoyed everything we've tried.   It is best to make a reservation - You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Nothing special. Dishes are hit and miss and are definitely pricey for the portions you get. I can't speak for the Tuesday $1 specials, but came on Sunday and the only good dish was the premium oyster (Sunday special was $1 off premium oysters). East coast oysters were huge and fresh. Everything else was disappointing: sashimi is mediocre at best (tasted like they brought them out from the refrigerator), tuna/avocado tartar was incredibly tiny, eel risotto was pretty salty (eat this one first if you like salty dishes). Double salmon roll was decent but nothing novel. The restaurant vibe and music are great though (lots of remixed 80s/90s music) and the drink menu has more variety than most izakayas. If you get cocktails, I recommend the slush cocktails - large portions. House white wine was pretty decent as well if you prefer something on the drier side."}
{"text":"Make a reservation or almost impossible to get a table. I wanted to try this place for awhile, last time i went there it was totally packed and the guy said at least wait for an hour. We switched to izakaya tsuki which is as good, and when we finished our meal the nome staff said we have a table. .. what  Anyways,  this time i went for the Wednesday $1 oyster night without reservation.  We went there at 6pm and the waitress told us \"i need the table bk by 7:30pm that's what i can do for u\".. for some reason all the waitresses r dressed kind of sexy but not friendly.  So we found out apart from the $1 oyster .. there's also a deal for fanny bay oysters 10 for $12. DON'T BOTHER ABOUT THE $1 OYSTER.  The fanny bay one is way more amazing, they are much bigger and better! The $1 oyster is not even half of the fanny bay oysters size and they are very salty. The oysters were so good we ended up having 30 oysters. We also ordered the eel risotto, double salmon roll and sashimi mash. The sashimi mash is average, double salmon roll is great but the risotto.... i wouldn't call it risotto because i feel like it's overcooked or they are not using the Italian type of rice.   Overall experience was great, if they improve on their services would be perfect."}
{"text":"Raw oysters with sake always the best here. Udon salad is amazingly good. Must try bake oyster it's really good but can't eat too many. Tried mix Sashimi dish but did not like it that much. Sushi roll was alright."}
{"text":"Amazing place good food Tuesday and Wednesday is oyster night. My favourite place for oysters can't beat the price. Nice atmosphere and good looking waitresses. The staff is really friendly and helpful. I would recommend this place to anyone. Try the japa burgers really tasty great spot even for a drink or 2. But def try the oysters a must have at this place."}
{"text":"Tried Nome for the first time on a Thursday (buck a shuck oyster). This is an awesome place, not your typical Japanese place, they have all the STD Japanese menu and then some delicious appetizers. I tried the deep Fried pork belly and grilled beef tongue and Both were done to perfection. I definitely recommend this place. Wether it's for dinner or hanging out with friends for drinks and appetizer. Give it try and you will be pleasantly surprised. Service is fast and staff are friendly."}
{"text":"I live in the area and finally got a chance to try Nome on Saturday night.  There was a big UFC fight, so it was pretty crowded, but my party of 3 managed to get seated without reservations, as long as we were out by 10pm.  The service was pretty good.  The waitresses were accomodating and friendly.  The food left much to be desired.  We shared the takoyaki, the double salmon roll, the balsamic beef, and the baked oysters.  The takoyaki was pretty standard.  There wasn't anything bad about it, but it wasn't outstanding as standard japanese tapas fare.  The double salmon roll was an interesting concept since it is cooked salmon inside the roll and smoked salmon on the outside.  However, I guess I expected more flavour and it seemed a bit on the \"forgettably bland\" side.  The balsamic beef was more like a salad, and a very interesting balsamic rub on the beef, but the beef wasn't as fresh as I would've liked for something served medium rare.  The baked oysters were way to watery and I couldn't even feel like I was chewing an actual oyster.  For the kind of price being paid, in my mind, I would rather go to Guu though the type of food being served is not exactly the same.  However, the bar has plenty of televisions and a good bar ambiance.  It has a good selection of cocktails (though I didn't try that particular night), and the service is decent.  I wouldn't go for the food, though, given the price point and what I could expect elsewhere.  My three-star rating is driven by the friendly wait staff, good bar atmosphere, and passable, though not terrific food for the value."}
{"text":"Great place to have drinks. Offers a pretty decent Japanese tapas menu. It's great for small groups. They should have a better method to reserve tables online though because I've had trouble getting through a few times."}
{"text":"My first 5 star review on this site. Very intimate, chills, relaxed environment. Japa burgers are incredible. I was NEVER into oysters before but after this place I think I got my first taste of them and will definitely be trying them again in the future. By far the most interesting Japanese restaurant I've been to, don't even remember the names of other places I've gone to, but this one by far takes the cake. Again, I love the setting, atmosphere, good services, and again, the intimacy part, good place to take your date to. Very impressive. I think the owner is Korean, that's a plus. I'm gonna try every freaking thing on that menu, but Japa burgers will be my staple whenever I go there for sure. This place ain't even for burgers yet one of the best I've had."}
{"text":"Usually go Wednesdays for the Oyster specials. Make sure you make a reservation, place gets busy. The Japanese Sliders are insanely good and they play a good mix of music to chow down too. Really need to start opening for lunch."}
{"text":"This place is very close to where I live. I have been there a few times. Overall it's very good. Food is very delicious. And staff is very friendly. My favorite is their Tuesday and Wednesday oyster $1 deal. But it's a long waiting time.  Every time I call to book reservation . They are mostly fully reserved."}
{"text":"Just went here over the weekend with my husband. Tried out there deep fried pork belly, marinated short ribs and some of their oysters. My favourite were the East Coast oysters as it was juicy and I didn't taste any of the sand. I really liked the ambiance as it wasn't as loud as some izakayas I have been to. Definitely recommend you to check it out! As for parking, there is paid parking in the back. -CY"}
{"text":"This is my favorite place to visit if I want some oysters and it is a perfect place. Today I finally reserved a spot at 20:30 for us. We were so happy and excite to visit. But, this time, I'm VERY VERY VERY disappoint.   Here is why:  So we got a seat on the second floor and I think they just had it recently... anyways we ordered 20 Fanny Bay oysters and 10  Kusshi oysters and salad. Fanny Bay came out first, and we enjoyed it very much and then Kusshi. Personally, I like Kusshi more than  Fanny Bay, because I think you can taste a bit of sweet while you area eating it.  However, the second one of Kusshi I ate, after first bite, I SPITTED  it out right the way. IT WAS  NOT FRESH. And my bf ate one. SAME.!!  So we told the staff and he replaced those 2 for us.  But another one my bf ate, it was not fresh as well. Ends up we asked to replace the whole thing. Which it make sense, because you don't want to try all of them.    We weren't mad or angry or anything. BUT on the way home, I felt dizzy and headache. worse and worse.  The moment I got home I ran to my washroom and start VOMITING, like I vomited all the food I enjoyed 20 mins ago, like everything!!.... and I felt very very dizzy and headache........ NEVER HAPPEN ANYTHING LIKE THIS BEFORE IN MY LIFE...... I am very very disappoint about this time.... And I REALLY REALLY  HOPE they can have FRESH food all the time, especially Oysters. I don't anyone experience my experience, it is not a good experience to have.   I don't think I will go back to Nome, at least not for now."}
{"text":"Tried twice. Service is HORRIBLE. I will never go back. Kinka Izakaya is just across the street, might as well go to a proper Jap bar."}
{"text":"Fanny Bay oyster was great and fresh. It's a good deal too on a Tuesday and Wednesdays. Japa-burger is also highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Be seated at the patio, nice weather and ambience, all dishes are great, love it! They added a fantastic candle on my birthday cake too. Best of the best!"}
{"text":"- Japa-burgers!!! - DJs making money of other people's music Friday and Saturdays (popular house and trance)  - Usually busy  - loud, fun vibe  - might need a reservation  - small venue"}
{"text":"Great energy, good food, good drinks, mediocre to bad service every single time.   Tons of shareable apps and an extensive list of sake.  Make sure to call ahead if you're planning on coming here on a friday/saturday evening as it is always busy. Average wait times are around 1hr."}
{"text":"I come here every week! This place is so good its hard to stay away. I first started coming here because im a huge fan of oysters and a restaurant that has $1 oysters on tuesdays & wednesdays in my area was a no brainer. Their dishes are always consistent in taste and quality. The servers are gorgeous and they're always on top of everything I need before I even know I need it. Even if the restaurant is busy they somehow have a way of making you feel like you're a part of the family. Great food, Great service, great ambiance. Nome Izakaya is my go to place; they never disappoint !!"}
{"text":"I've been back many times to Nome and it finally deserves an updated review. Like I said before Nome is great for birthday parties. I booked a table for 10 people on a saturday night. We basically ordered the entire menu  he..he...he.....   --5/5 ITEMS-- Favourite starters: +[ Octo wasabi ] - tiny pickled wasabi flavoured octopus bits with seaweed on the side so you can wrap it.  +[ Spicy Sashimi ]Tortilla Bites - I wish I can eat these all night... You don't taste fishiness at all!. RED TUNA, spicy jalapeno salsa on tortilla chips = AWESOME.   Favourite Salad: +[ Sashimi salad ] - assorted sashimi on top of a bed of gardens dressed with a creamy sesame dressing and topped with cruncy fried onions. Hands down our most favourite dish, we always order at least 2.   Fav. in the Chef Suggestion: +[ Japaburgers ] +[ Wara-yaki ] - this dish just melts in your mouth. After I eat this dish... I dream about it and I drool. No lie. I am serious. xD  +[ Bulgogi tacos ] -amazing as well but if you ordered too many beef dishes already the other tacos are just as great. +[ Monkfish tacos ]   Favourite fried: +[ Takoyaki ] (5pcs) +[ Ebi mayo ] aka tigershrimp  Favourite Grilled: +[ baked oysters ] - cheeseyy creameyyy goodnesssss +[ Grilled beef tongue ] -youre probably thinking.. TONGUE?! yes tongue !! its rly good and not weird at all so get the word tongue out of your head and order this fruit from the forbidden tree dish. +[ Spicy short ribs ] - goes great with a side of steamed rice  Favourite Sushi rolls: + [ Tuna coin ] - spicy tuna on top of a deep fried sushi roll. Easy to eat and very delicious.   for the Sashimi section I pretty much love all the dishes. They are not the biggest portion but are worth trying.   Service is excellent. Oh for the guys, the girls are still pretty & hot there. You can tell they take their job seriously. Our server was friendly and had this very cool chill attitude. She wasnt shy and was very enthusiastic when doing the sake-bomb chant.   Nome is a great chill spot. I've gone to just eat, I've gone to eat and drink lightly (beers/sake/soju) and Ive gone to party and pop Hennessy bottles. Honestly I have a great time every time and it definitely deserves a 5 star review."}
{"text":"My friend heard about their fresh oysters special on Tuesdays and wednesdays ($1/oyster), so we've decided to try it out on Tuesday.   It was obvious the place was lacking staffs since it took a few minutes until someone to noticed us after we awkwardly stood there not knowing if we should seat ourselves or wait. But once we sat down, the gentleman who seated us (looks like the manager or boss) gave us each an oyster to try and they were delicious. We then ordered a dozen of the malpeques p.e.i oysters which was recommended to us, and half a dozen of french kiss oysters from n.b. All was fresh and tasty, one didn't look too great so the gentleman mentioned above kindly replaced with another one. The place is simple and nice, somehow it reminds me of oyster boys with lots of seatings at the bar and high tables.   Unfortunately, i didn't get a chance to try anything else there besides oysters since I've ordered a Chilean Sea Bass and it never came, after 25mins of waiting I had to tell the waitress to cancel it and bring the bill if they haven't started cooking it. I then noticed when she came to the pos system, she printed the bill out quite quickly, which meant she forgot to put the order in. Canceling an item out doesn't take that quick.   I understand that they lack staffs and when it's busy, things happens. But what I'm unhappy about was that the waitress then came and only apologize to only my friend and not to me. It's a courtesy to apologize to everyone at the table in general and not just one particular person, especially when I'm the one that is already unhappy that I did not get the food I ordered and was starving. I'm still very much upset because she forgot to put in my order, I starved and had to settle in eating that tasteless hot dog in the movie theater afterward. And I didn't even get an apology.   Also, after she gave us our change she kind of stood there procrastinating, giving me an impression like she was waiting for her tip.   I'll come back once again to try the other food, hopefully my service experience will be better then and hope the other items on the menu are good. Will review once more.  ------------------  Update: nov 12/12  Been back a few times after the review. I was able to try more dishes from the menu, most were great. I have no complaints about the food or drinks at all. However service is still an issue the last time I was there (month or two ago). Hope it got better now, but do come by for the food. :)"}
{"text":"Yay! I'm a fan!  Love this place, hate how it only opens during the night and is almost always so busy, but that's what happens when other people love this place also!  My favourites definitely have to be the sliders, fried chips(?? don't know the name), and oysters (fresh and baked). Actually scratch that, the whole place tastes amazing."}
{"text":"The shrimp udon salad is so delicious I crave for this on a regular basis. The $1/oyster is worth it, but make sure you make reservations. The sushis are yummy and made right. The grapefruit sawa is my favourite drink in town."}
{"text":"If you want a Izakaya night with friends but don't want to go all the way to downtown, Nome would be your best choice. Located at the centre of North York with a great variety of sake. They have super fresh oysters and awesome baked oysters. Love their tako shashimi appetizer with a hint of wasabi and wrap with seaweed. Also recommend their deep fried chicken wings with their special hot sauce!"}
{"text":"Ambiance is great along with awesome selection of japanese food. Great time to hang out at night with friends. Staff is very friendly! Overall an excellent place when You're craving for Japanese food."}
{"text":"Salmon apple dish tasty but portion size decreased compared to previous visits. Baked oyster better at Kinka, here bery tiny piece of actual oyster. Staff are fine, not the greatest serving skills but lets be honest about the reason why they were hired..."}
{"text":"This is a Japanese Izakaya that sells small Japanese tapas, sushi, and of course drinks. We came here around 5pm (when they open) around a weekday, and there were already about 5-6 tables occupied.   We ordered the Japa burger, salmon Poke, chicken Kaarage, honey garlic corn, and for desserts, ice cream cheescake.  To be absolutely honest, the food quality wasn't superb and better than the other izakayas I've been to. It was just mediocre and  expensive for the quality. Although the cocktails were delicious, we came here for the food and left a bit disappointed given how hyped this place was.  The service was great however, as the waitresses were prompt with our order and food.   Overall, I don't think I would come back here, there is really no advantage over the other izakayas around the city."}
{"text":"Best go with reservation otherwise be prepared to wait for at least 30m. Seems like a hot-spot in town, which is explainable with their soft house sake, special-priced oyster and yummy beef sashimi."}
{"text":"This is one of the best spots at Yonge and Sheppard. Great food and good atmosphere.   It is a Japanese izakaya, small tapas place with Asian-American fusion fare. The Japa Burger is highly recommended and is a must on every visit, it's the best slider I've ever had with a fantastic sauce.   Also recommended is the tiger shrimps and the spicy shortribs. Great food overall. On a side note, this is one of a rare few places to get a Polar Beer/Frozen Sapporo in Toronto currently.   The atmosphere is good here too, the only place that is usually busy/exciting on a weekday in this area and usually friendly people (especially with some group sake-bombs). They play good old-school hip hop from time to time too and have a DJ that plays on weekend nights, where the atmosphere gets more bar/club than restaurant.   Highly recommended in the Yonge and Sheppard area."}
{"text":"Great food... My girls and I always come here for Ladies night out on tues or wed cuz love the oyster here."}
{"text":"Very delicious food! Highly recommend trying the jappa burgers, 3 small burgers that taste phenomenal!"}
{"text":"Showed up for our reservation on time.  They seated us upstairs where the door was open to the outside (temperature was 8 degrees).  It was cold.  We asked them to close the door to which they responded \"it gets claustrophobic if we close the door\" - really? What do they do in the winter?   They also refused to accommodate us at a different table so we left."}
{"text":"I came here with my family for their buck-a-shuck on a Tuesday and damn was it delicious! We had about 7 dozen oysters that came with a nice variety of sauces.   We ordered other things as well - a plate of shashimi (very fresh), the tuna tartar (very small portion but it was amazing), the kalbi tacos (also amazing!), and the some fried squid (so good).   The ambiance was great - it's not too big of a place but it had a very modern vibe to it. Our waitress was great and the food came fairly quickly.   I recommend making a reservation if coming for the buck-a-shuck because it gets busy. One little story I wanted to share - I had written on my reservation that it was my birthday and at the end of the night, they brought me a piece of cheesecake with a huge sparkler. It was a wonderful surprise and very thoughtful of the restaurant.   Great restaurant, definitely worth trying!"}
{"text":"Decided to go there on Wednesday for $1 oyster night. We actually wanted to go there for 8pm but when we called, the wait for a table would be over an hour so we settled for a reservation for 10pm (table of 4) instead. Not a big deal and I'm very glad that I called in advance.   Parking is street parking or there's a parking lot in the back. Since we arrived at 10pm the street parking was free and we managed to find a parking space.   We arrived on time and had to wait approximately 10-15 minutes for the table, which ended up to be the booth beside the washroom. Every time someone left the door open, we were greeted with the view of the washroom door; hence they they lose one star. On the plus side, the staff there were very good at closing it and since the washroom is downstairs, it didn't smell.   They had a very extensive drink menu. We ordered the mango mojito iced tea and berry mojito; both of which were very good. Would definitely try something else next time. We ordered a bunch of $1 oysters (malpeque; they were out of the Fanny Bay ones) and they were very fresh and good. We also ordered the tiger shrimp, pork belly, and lobster fantasy.   I thought the pork belly was okay. It just wasn't my thing due to the fat. The tiger shrimp was AMAZING; would definitely go back for that. The lobster fantasy (sushi) was very good as well.   Would definitely go back to try other things and for the $1 lobsters. Definitely make reservations in advance (if you intend to show up before 10:30) or go a little later. By the time we left (11:30-ish) it wasn't as busy as we went. There was no wait at the door anymore though the tables were relatively full."}

{"text":"We decided to dine here for dinner on Monday (despite it not being a $1 oyster day). It was an OK experience though the restaurant wasn't too fancy or the food overly scrumptious. We ordered tuna coin ($16), Japa burgers ($10), Sesame Salmon ($7.5), and Unagi risotto ($8.8).  (We were seated near the bathrooms near the entrance even though I believe there were seats down the hall, but I wasn't too upset about that.) Anyhow, let's get down to business. I'll be as concise and precise as I can. In sum, get tuna coin if you are at the restaurant already and don't get the risotto if you want a healthy palate to savor your seafood.  Tuna coin: pretty and delicious but really, such small portions that a toddler would cry in outrage! I understand that this place is a tapas place but come on, for 16 dollars? If you have a penchant for this kind of spending, go ahead. The tuna was fresh and the presentation lovely.   Japa burgers: I'm biased against burgers and the only reason we ordered this is to fill up our stomach at as low cost as possible. It was OK. You won't be too pleased unless you are very fond of burgers to begin with.  Sesame salmon: I have to complain about the portions again. The sashimi was fresh but it was 3 spoonfuls.   Unagi risotto: I had high hopes of this one because I am a big fan of risottos, Italian style. Warning to everyone that the risotto is very creamy and salty. I had to eat a lot of ginger to kill the cream taste. The Unagi is good but two finger-ful in size.   The meal cost around $60 and I left sullen and sorry."}
{"text":"I live in the area and there are a couple of pretty good Izakaya's in the hood.  Good food, decent service!  Oysters were a little small but I wasn't expecting too much since they were only $1 each.  A little loud at times but that is to be expected.  Parking at rear of the building."}
{"text":"Very disappointed, heard great things about this place prior to coming in, had to book quite some time ahead to reserve a table, but it just wasn't what I had expected.  The restaurant looks very nice, however it's very dark, way too dark for a restaurant- I had to use the flash light on my phone to read the menu.  The space was very crammed, my friend and I were practically hitting each other's elbow the entire night. We had a tall table with stools (for dining not the bar), weren't very comfortable.  As for the food, the oysters were at most average, the prices were good- Tuesday and Wednesday special for $1 per oyster, lots of sauces to choose from so that's a plus as well.   The sliders (Tappaburgers) were very tasty, however the buns were completely cold and not toasted what so ever, it was dry and would have ruined the sliders if it weren't for the extra sauce.   Beef teriyaki was no where near expected and was a little bit cold. Takoyaki and baked oysters were very delicious.  I would not recommend this restaurant overall as I feel like it's not worth it, there are better options for better prices else where."}
{"text":"Food here is excellent, try the japa-burgers if you're looking for a quick and tasty bite, the lobster fantasy is delicious if you're feeling like something indulgent, always lively this place is a spot to check out for sure"}
{"text":"Expensive but fresh. There is limited choice of stuff in the menu that can make me feel full. My favourite dish there is the cheese mushroom rice. This one is really tasty. The bad thing is that my ear cannot stand the shout there. I may prefer somewhere more quite."}
{"text":"Really very poor. To just get full a family of 4 spent nearly 300$. The only good thing was the beef tongue the rest was really very average. Long wait for service, super small portions waiters that straight out lie to you this was quite ridiculous. We started with some sushi which was ok nothing to right home about. But then the rest was awful tiny scallops, overlooked beef, undercooked fish, overlooked shrimp. At the end to fill up we had to order rice, never coming back again.   Edit   What I'm saying is that for the amount of money we spent , we could have had more of a good a meal at places with a similar price point like blowfish or ki"}
{"text":"Make reservations as the place gets really packed. Good food, good service!"}
{"text":"Work in the area and never noticed this restaurant until last night.  Very nice renovation inside and out but we seated in a L booth which accommodates a party of 3-4 and it was probably the worst table in the restaurant.  We tried to request a different table since we did made reservation but the hostess did very little to accommodate our request; service is definitely not their priority.  Regardless, we tried not to let it bother us and just enjoy the food.  We were served a small dish of oysters on the house so that was a nice touch at least.  We ordered many dishes to share and they were all very pleasing to our taste buds.  Some of the dishes that stood out were their fried pork belly and their sliders; super delicious!  Their pitchers of Sapporo were fairly priced.  Otherwise, their tapas were on the pricier side.    Its a very nice restaurant for drinks and food and I'll definitely go back.  With that said, I want to give Nome 4 stars but the lack of customer service brought my rating to 3 stars."}
{"text":"Our go to place for cheap Japanese eats in North York.   Service is slow, but food is not bad with relatively low price point. Sake sangria is pretty interesting, it's the special on Thursdays, great deal to welcome the weekend."}
{"text":"I love Japanese food but when it comes to izakaya places I'm not usually a repeat customer - with the exception of Nome. Service is always great there (everyone is friendly in Nome, including the owner who is super helpful, and the responsive server who refilled our crackers that came with the Korean beef sashimi when she saw that we still had a lot of sashimi left - amazing!). On top of that, the whole ambiance at Nome is just truly enjoyable, I love the rustic feel and the choice of lighting in that whole place. And, most importantly, the food are just delicious! My personal favourite has to be the ebi mayo and the takoyaki, but I haven't been disappointed with any item in their menu so far. Also, it may be worth mentioning that he location is convenient for both drivers and transit commuters alike, it's a great meet up point even when you have friends living in the different corners of the GTA. Definitely 5/5 for me!"}
{"text":"Jap-burgers (sliders)  Short ribs Bulgogi tacos  All have the same amazing sauce  Busy almost every night - make a reservation   The music is unnecessarily loud even on off nights"}
{"text":"Been here once and the food is really really good. Had oyster, little japanese burger, squid balls and creamy rice thingy. It won't really fill you up though, might eat something else if you are not satisfied."}
{"text":"Great upstairs patio and good food. Loved it."}
{"text":"Food is great, service is usually pretty good.  Everyone I have taken her has loved it!"}
{"text":"awesome food and atmosphere!!!  one of my favourite places to go. some great recommendations are $1 oysters, tuna coin, japa burger, tiger shrimp and sashimi salad. these are just some selected items as nome does have quite a large menu so definitely would go back to try other items. I also love their sake with yogurt, its such a great combination, light and not too sweet :) the place might look kind of small but you'll be surprised how many people they can seat. definitely recommend it :)"}
{"text":"I went here for a good bye party with 20 other people, the place is fairly small but really cute! We got a really long table just for us right in front, their food isnt all that great since they're mainly appitizers. Although they're fairly expensive the beer an stuff were fairly cheap an it's right next to macdonalds so if you need to cool down! Fun place to chat an have fun with people drink an smoke around!"}
{"text":"It's another long overdue review. I've gone numerous times and this place has always done me well. It gets a bit busy on Fridays but otherwise during the week is usually good. In terms of some of my recommended dishes here: The shrimp udon salad is one of my favourites, light, healthy and good The chicken wings Spicy short ribs Japa burgers Bulgogi tacos"}
{"text":"came for the oyster specials on a wednesday, oysters were good and other food surprised us as well. we ordered salmon apple sashimi, unagi risotto, butter scallops and shrimps, and also the lobster roll. All of them were excellent!  services were quick and nice, speedy responses and took minimal time to get the dishes served! i also ordered a glass of japanese plum wine, but they didn't serve it with ice when it came. server was glad to provide me with a full glass of ice when i asked for it :)  recommended, but it was a little bit noisy if you're looking for a place to chat,"}
{"text":"I have actually been coming here for over a year now and I absolutely love it.  The food here is just amazing, ranging from the freshly shucked oysters to the Japanese inspired sliders known as the Japa-Burgers, Nomé Izakaya delivers great tastes that will please your palette in more ways than one.  The atmosphere is different depending on what night you show up but it's always fun, especially with a group of friends.  The tapas style menu makes the eating experience with a group a great time allowing everyone at the table to have multiple tastes instead of having to commit to one entrée.  There are daily deals and a wide variety of shots and drinks on their drink menu and they serve Sapporo on tap which is a huge plus in my book :)  Whether it be drinks with some friends or dinner with the family Nomé Izakaya is a place that caters a great dining and social experience."}
{"text":"One of the best, if not THE best Izakaya joints in TO. Ordered the  Japa-burger (which is basically a gourmet slider). It comes x3 small sliders on each order--which is perfect for 2 ppl. Pork belly, Takoyaki (octopus), Tiger shrimp, Chilean sea bass, Tuna Coin (a \"sushi roll\" cut & fried to crisp the exterior, are all top dishes, & Tuesday/Wednesday evenings are, buck-a-shuck oysters!  Been here b4 & will keep coming back. Trendy atmosphere, with reasonable prices, & attentive staff."}
{"text":"Went here on a Friday night for a sister's night out and I must say, this place deserves every bit of it's recognition. To begin with the food is absolutely incredible. We ordered about 5 dishes for 2 people and were extremely happy with the portions and taste.   Do not leave without trying the lobster fantasy and tiger shrimp (ebi-mayo). The drinks were nice and refreshing too. The service was courteous and efficient. Great spot in the North York!"}
{"text":"Out of all the places I've tried, Nome has the absolute best raw oysters ever! They offer $1 raw oysters on Tuesday and Wednesday (beyond worth it!) with the best dressings to go with the oysters. In addition to their oyster special, Nome has pretty decent menu that offers a wide selection of dishes great for parties and gatherings. I personally love their Japaburgers, Udon salad, Soju with yogurt, and sashimi dishes! Pricing is fair although I do find certain things on their menu a bit overpriced. Other then that, Nome is one of our favourite spots for gatherings and celebrations with friends!"}
{"text":"Great place for Japanese tapas and drinks. The oysters were amazing. The guys shucking them knew their stuff. The servers are all very friendly and helpful in making good recommendations.  Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Came here Wednesday night for the oyster special: $1/ raw oyster! The place was buzzing so be sure to make a reservation in advance of you want a table.  The rundown: - piña colada frosty (with rum and that good stuff, ~$8?); - 2 x dozen Malpeque raw oysters (P.E.I.) (special, $1 each = $24); - Lobster Fantasy Roll ($18); - Unagi Risotto ($8.80); - Japa Burgers (3 sliders, $9.80).  The three of us were pretty stuffed.   Oysters were absolutely delicious. Risotto was nice as well but was a small portion. The lobster fantasy roll was a favourite; the lobster meat tasted very fresh. The Piña Colada frosty was soooo good I could have had 5 of those. I couldn't taste the alcohol in there; they must have been lighthanded in the dosing. Service was great and super attentive and respectful. I will be back."}
{"text":"Hmm okay .. So far my  favorite restaurant. Good service , Good Food and wicked Bartender lol.  UFC fight  night is live , the only problem is that it gets packed during UFC fights that it will be very hard to find a table unless you book in advance.  My fave's ... Sliders, Tiger Shrimp, Short Ribs and cant go wrong with $1 Oysters."}
{"text":"Finally, a good Izakaya in Yonge and Sheppard area. I love the Udon salad!!! its sooo gooooood you have to try it. YOU MUST. They have fresh oyster special on Tuesdays and Wednesdays? or Thursday. (I went on Tuesday night so not sure about the other day) Fresh oyster is only $1 for a piece. Average price for drinks, I beleive a pitcher of Sapporo was $16? but I had large cans of sapporo ($7) bc their draft was dried up and kubota cold sake.  The food items  are unique, never seen them before in other places. I had Salad Udon, which they have udon noodle in a salad with 5 huge shirmps with awesome dressing. I loved it. I am definitely gonna go back for this. Samurai Crunch, it was also good, kind of similar to salad udon, black cod yaki, dozen of oyster special. creamy potato (also very good) Food are so good that eventhough it's an izakaya I might go just for food. Actually a couple next to my table were having dinner without drinks. Our waitress Sylvia was very professional polite and courteous. BUt she was the only server so she was in rush serving people. She forgot our sake cups...   oooo and we also had a complimentary bowl of edamame but I'm pretty sure that everyone in the restaurant got it too."}
{"text":"OBSESSED with Nome! we have brought lots of people here and continue to reccomend it to all our friends  .... here are just a FEW reasons why  1- BUCK-A-SHUCK oysters Tues/ Wed nights ! my BF LOVES them .....they bring them out by the second, all night long !  2- i love the sashimi salad, Kalbi beef tacos, japa burgers and more !  3- service is always fantastic !  4- Patrick the owner is awesome , super nice friendly guy if u see him , say hi and he loves his regulars !  5- close to home, easy to park in the area and not too crowded , for the most part"}
{"text":"Amazing sushi, some of the freshest ever,  incredibly friendly staff with great portions,  a colleague and I shared a large sushi boat the tuna and butter fish were awesome!"}
{"text":"I went there for Friday night. It was great place to hang out with friends.  Good music, good food and good service!  They were completely packed that night. I can tell many people think the same way. I highly recommend for their aloe soju. It was so delicious!!! We only could have our table for two hours. TT  TT Didn't have enough time but they were super busy, should book the table earlier if anyone is going!!"}
{"text":"I have been there many times. So far everything is pretty good. It's most packed on Tuesday and Wednesday for their $1 oyster night.  If you want to get in on those days, better to make reservation a day ahead of time."}
{"text":"Both the service and food was great! Wasn't expecting much when we were planning on going here. I just wanted some oysters so we came on a day with oyster specials. We ordered 28 oysters between two of us and they were both delicious and quick to arrive. We also had the burgers and the potatoes which were both Chef Specials. They both tasted really good. Will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"We been to many Izakayas, this is the worst experience we ever had.  We came here for the $! Oyster night, however we will never go back again.  People watch out, if you ever pass by, don't ever let your curiosity take over you to try to go in there. This is not an authentic Izakaya...their food sucks, their service sucks..If you are looking for authentic Izakaya experience, don''t ever go here.  First of, they sat us right below the TV, little did we know that they were trying to be a sport bar, so they blast on the TV right above my husband head.  First of all if they want to be a sports bar, please change the name.  It is misleading and I did not go to this restaurant to be at a sports bar otherwise I would have gone to one.     Secondly, we never ever received such bad services from an IZAKAYA.  Really, please don't call yourself an izakaya when you are a damn sport bar.  Their server ignores you even when they see you especially the Bartender, they saw us trying to flag her down, all she did was look at us, turn her head and start playing on her damn cell phone.  Really? When we ask for a manager to complain, they send someone \"who is in charge!!!!\" and when everything is done, she comes out and tell us hope everything is fixed now.  Excuse me??? Who are you?  Are you the manager and you have such nerves to come out now?  In my mind, I am thinking, really? Are you sure you are the manager? Because you never took ownership of our concerns when you were there at the front the whole effing time.   All in all, weak sauce and never again!!!  This place ain't nothing compare to Guu, Tsuki, Inakaya or even the new one Yuzu..."}
{"text":"I was disappointed at this place, everyone in the group thought it was average.  Not on the same level as Guu or Kinka Izakaya.  Let's make a comparison this way, it's a step above all-you-can-eat for sure but then it's a step down from really good Izakaya like Guu.  First of all, the sashimi salad while the portion was good was very bland, they need to really improve the dressing.  The starter assorted sashimi was similar to AYCE quality.  The baked oysters were reasonably priced at 4/$10 but the ingredient that's baked with the oysters could be improved.  They had oyster specials when we went there, it was $1/Fanny Bay and they were really refresh, many types of sauces were provided.  I feel like every dish we had was very average but because of the reasonable price, it's somewhat justifiable.  Sorry that I have to go back to Kinka Izakaya but I felt like at Kinka/Guu, every dish is somewhat more refined in taste and appearance.  One extra star for the fast service, food came out really fast.  I probably won't come back here again, I think it's overrated looking at the reviews."}
{"text":"Overall mixed feelings about this place but doesn't make me want to go back often.   Food: I love the baked oysters, delicious. The raw oysters is fresh and clean but limited selection and no one described the sauces to us. The ribs were average. The first time I had theirs japo-burger was really good. This time around, it was lukewarm and seemed to lack some flavour that made it stand out last time. Tried the karrage, I didn't like the sauce but at last the chicken was tender.  Food comes out very fast so my experience eating there felt very rushed since food would get cold if I didn't hurry and eat.  Decor/Service: Decor is trendy but the tables are too close to each other. You can hear everything your neighbours say. Also, service is not good. No one came to check up on us or refill water. I wanted to know about the different sauces for the oyster but everyone was too busy to let us know. We resorted to just taste testing them all. Also, when they brought our oysters, no one would tell us which type was what. When we finally asked, they told us wrong and later came back to tell us."}
{"text":"My most recent experience was during the holidays for a work dinner. Food came out pretty quick, but there were times when we had to flag down our server to add orders to our dinner. We ordered 1 dozen malepeque oysters, 1 dozen kusshi, japa burger, samarai crunch, sashimi salad, lobster roll, sashimi don, short ribs, seafood Mac and cheese, fish tacos and chips for 5 people. Overall the food was pretty tasty. The fish tacos tasted oddly like chicken.   We were stuffed. No room for dessert.   Our whole party got extremely sick following this meal. It was a good thing none of us had to work, because our office would have had to be closed. We all had the same symptoms... everything was coming out of both ends.   Not sure if it was because the holidays that they were too busy and food wasn't properly stored or somehow got contaminated.   Either way this meal pretty much ruined Christmas 2017 for me."}
{"text":"Food, service, atmosphere and, hot waitresses.  This place has it all, plus oysters.  A must, must, must visit when in Toronto."}
{"text":"Horrible service. Last time we came 10mins earlier than our reservation, and they seated us 10mins after the reservation. They have a grace period of 15mins, and we came exactly 15mins after, and they gave the table away!"}
{"text":"Been there twice, expensive. worth it if you have a bigger group of more than 3 people.  Upstairs is big, Patio is big as well ( upstairs).  Food is great.  Service is okay."}
{"text":"Came to this place on a Thursday night with a friend who has previously been here. The polished wood furnishing and vintage lamps give the establishment a rustic/industrial feel. The lighting was warm and the atmosphere was relaxing and cozy.  We were told upon sitting down about the specials from the drink menu and we were offered two complimentary Malpeque oysters. Try not to get the high tables because the stools are not at all comfortable. We ordered a pitcher of Sapporo as well as a dozen of Kusshi oysters to start. I was very impressed with the quality of the oysters; they were really fresh and tasted amazing, I'm a big oyster fan and these oyster were definitely some of the bests I've had in Toronto. We then ordered the following dishes:  Fried pork belly - 10/10 Crispy on the outside and super moist and melt-in-your-mouth tender on the inside. The seaweed paste drizzle on top made it absolutely perfect.  Korean beef tartare (yuk hoe) - 8/10 Can't recall the name they have on the menu but I've had this dish many times at many Korean establishments, as it is a Korean dish. The way they make it here is pretty much the same but the cut of beef they used seemed to have a bit too much fat in it. The Korean restaurant right beside them makes super awesome yuk hoe, just saying.   Unagi risotto 0/10 Aw-ful. What was served was not risotto, it wasn't even close to risotto, it was more  like a bowl of dried up congee with a slice of Unagi on top. Seriously can't believe how can anyone like it.  Tako-wasabi: 8/10 good little starter. Good amount of wasabi, has a good kick to it but didn't overpower the flavour of the octopus, which was good.   Finished our meal with a cheesecake and two bloody Caesars, which I believe goes by another name here, no salt rim nor celery or cucumber stick, but it tasted pretty good, seems like there is horseradish in it. Service was ok, nothing to brag about, we were ignored a bit towards the end of our meal as I had to walk all the way to our waitress at the front where all of them chit-chatted to order my second Caesar. She had a bit of an attitude but we were also helped by another one who was really nice. Bill was $110. It was overall an ok experience and I will likely come back for the pork belly and try out their 1$/oyster Tuesdays and Wednesdays."}
{"text":"I visited here with my friends for some late night beer joint. I had raw oysters and tako wasabi. I have to say that I was very disappointed.  I got symptoms of food poisoning(nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea).  I think their oyster was not fresh.  It took so long our server to come over to take our drinks. The waitress was not attentive, too.  My another complaint was the noise level, we could barely hear each other."}
{"text":"Wow - What a pleasant surprise. Visited early last night to dig into some Maplpeque oysters on the half shell and they were delicious. At $1/oyster, I definitely had my fill. The service was outstanding and Zanity made that so. Defensively recommend stopping by!"}
{"text":"Came here for the very first time for my birthday on Saturday and had a wonderful dining experience. At first I thought this place was just overhyped from all the food posts I see on instagram but nome is actually worth the rave. Here's the list of what we had... asterisk (*) notes what I would recommend   Tornado potato  Yam fries Karage  Lobster fantasy roll  Black cod* Short ribs  Tako wasabi* Grilled beef tongue Ebi mayo* Oysters (forgot which kind)  XL Sapporo mug  Sake bombs*  Pro tip: Saturday special is $3 shooters. Also, the short ribs are spicy !!!"}
{"text":"Whenever I'm feeling for a fix of oysters, Nome is my go to place. Usually come here on a Tues/Weds for their oyster special and their wide selections of other foods. I love coming here to with a few girls because the atmosphere, the staff and the food is always great! Nothing less of 5 stars.   Parking is very convenient as it is right around the corner from the restaurant, in the back. Always make a reservation, the line ups are especially long when they have an event.  The Fanny Bay oysters, Sashimi salad, Lobster Fantasy Roll, Baked Oysters are always a must for me! The buttered scallop and shrimp is also bomb and very flavourful- but the portion is really small in my opinion. The tiger prawns and cracker/chips is also great- the portion is great for sharing with friends. I'm pretty sure anything on their menu won't disappoint though."}
{"text":"Came here for Buck a Shuck oysters on a Tuesday! Waited for about 20 minutes, sat at the bar. Not too many gluten free options especially for dessert which was not fun but I was there for the oysters after-all. Bathroom in basement."}
{"text":"One of my favourite Japanese Izakaya place. Book reservation in advance! All time favourite- Jappa burgers, pork belly, duck confit sushi roll."}
{"text":"Food was good. The waiter didn't tell us that tip was included in our bill (it was also hidden in the bill, it was just added to the total with no tip breakdown which is why we didn't realize). We only realized after my friend already paid and tipped twice that was in included."}
{"text":"Visited for the first time for dinner on a Friday.  Pros: - Busy intersection, easily reached via TTC. No free parking and paid green P easily accessible. - Phone reservations highly encouraged. Seats were available when promised. - Good selection of beverages, cocktails and sake - Interior is nicely decorated - Oyster topping sauces had lots of variety - $1 oysters on Tues and Wed. - Friendly and attentive staff - Fried shrimp dish was yummy - Free cheesecake if you're celebrating your birthday (almost every table was celebrating a birthday...)  Cons/Improvements: - Was looking for a larger selection of food menus and more authentic Japanese dishes. Most of the dishes were fusion styled and quite overpriced. $20 for a 8 piece roll and $50 for a 30 piece sashimi - Sake menu perhaps can include pictures / Kanji for those who recognize the label or Japanese name.  - Bigger portions rather than making customers pay for multiple dishes to accompany their alcohol - Improve quality of sushi and sashimi - they weren't bad, but I was hoping for more luxury varieties like uni or toro for the price I paid.  Summary: The ambience is great for a tapas style gathering with friends along with alcoholic beverages (what an izakaya should be) However, if you are looking for authentic Japanese cuisine and dining experience, this may not be the place for you. Our group of 4 ended up grabbing ramen down the street to fill us up."}
{"text":"A small little place - but packs a big punch on food and drinks!!  I've been here many times - and love the tapas-style, izakaya dining here.  My faves are the unagi risotto, sashimi salad, tako ..something (the app w octopus in sashimi, over seaweed) and of course, the oysters!  I wish they would serve the dishes in larger portions (sometimes if I come w a large group, all the food is gone quickly and I'm still hungry!).  It's also not cheap and it could get loud - but I think it's worth the treat once in a while!"}
{"text":"The items tried within two visits are listed below. The ones with *** are the ones I loved and would recommend. The kiwi mojito is kick ass too.  ***Fanny bay oysters Malpeques  ***Japa burgers Takoyaki Spicy beef ribs Regular beef ribs ***Shrimp udon salad Moriwase (sashimi) ***Korean style beef sashimi (tartare) ***ebi mayo Deep fried pork belly Baked oysters  Their Tuesday and Wednesday buck a shuck is awesome. They have a nice variety of sauces to cater to all. The lime/lemon salt and pepper sauce was yummy enough to drink."}
{"text":"Good food. Nice ambience. The food taste was nice. It is cozy fun and interesting. The burgers was delicious. And short ribs are juicy and tasteful."}
{"text":"Every time I go there, it's absolutely packed. Hint: you might want to make reservations. Personally I like staying at the bar, unless I'm with a bigger group, because it's big enough that you can set many plates.  I like the vibe of this restaurant. It's not a pure Izakaya in the traditional Japanese way, but the twists make it cool [E.G the DJ and house music on Fridays and Saturdays]. The food is good. I usually go there to drink but at the same time I order a bunch of stuff to munch on. I like the beef tongues and the short ribs the most because I find that it's a good complement to Sake =P."}
{"text":"Price? -Overall: 6/10 (10 means really expensive) -oysters: two promo on Tues & Wed($1 each)(10 for $12)  Service: 8/10 Food: 9/10 I have four dishes: oysters, burger, squid and sashimi don. All of them are delicious! All recommend.  Food amount: 6/10 (10 means a lot) Enough for ppl who drink. But u r only here for eating. U need to order a few.  Environment: 8/10 Feeling of a Japanese bar."}
{"text":"1$ Oysters? Yes please.  The japa burgers? It's very good! I really enjoyed Nomé, food was great but the music was loud. Overall I had a good time. *queues* - Queens \"don't stop me now\". Cause I was having a good time."}
{"text":"As soon as I walked in fell in love with the ambiance. Whether it's a private date or a friendly get together this little gem in the heart of North York is a must. Totally has a nice vibe and did I mention the service is superb. From the Oyster from the West Coast to baked oysters. I was simply impressed. Also tried the \"Lobster Fantasy\" and I actually tasted the lobster! The ambiance, the relatable music, friendly service and the fresh food prepared in front of your eyes definitely make it 5 star experience."}
{"text":"We visited Nome on Wed evening and took advantage of the oyster special. They were tasty and fresh and brought to the table super quick. Other buck-a-shuck places make you order a dozen at a time and take longer to bring to the table. We also had the sliders and Shrimp tortilla app and both were very good. Nice flavours and cooked just right.   The service was great and the place had a fun, lively atmosphere. They do stick to the 2 hr table limit as they get very busy - but it was enough time for us to enjoy our meal and have a few drinks before heading over to another spot for more drinks!"}
{"text":"Quick service. Yummy oysters. Perfectly cold pitcher or beer. Loved the music. They have in-house Dj to keep a good vibe. I will be back to try more of the menu."}
{"text":"Been almost a year since my first time and this place keeps me coming back!  I must say the food here has always been very consistent - I'm never disappointed! Like everyone says, the $1 oyster special on Tuesday/Wednesday is amazing! And even better, since my last review they've added new house made hot sauces to their repetoire... yum-o!  My new favourite dish is the Unagi Risotto... a MUST TRY!  They also added sushi rolls to the menu... a little bit pricy but the portion is big and really tasty!  Also recomended are their bellinis... very fruity and refreshing and they're made with sake. Last time I went on Friday and they were on special for $5 - can't beat that!  That is all!"}
{"text":"Too many short cuts: the octopus balls were deep fried batter with tiny centres of chewy tentacle, and the sashimi salad was a pile of lettuce with scraps of fish on top doused in mayo."}
{"text":"Good food, attentive service and good music.  Parking can be easily find at the back or on the side of this place.  Favourites: 1 buck oysters (Tuesday and Wednesday nights) and Mini burgers."}
{"text":"Good food, somewhat slow service and decent value. It does not seem to be run or staffed by Japanese, but still good times to be had. Will repeat if I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Nomé is \"hou may\". (Very tasty in Canto)  Food: 4/5 Ask for their best sellers. Service: 4/5 Friendly and helpful. Environment: 4/5 Dim dining room, fun upper patio. Washrooms: 3/5 Has line ups on busy days. Worth it?: 4/5 Pricey but not more than expected.  Reservations recommended.  I have only been here for $1 oysters so it has always been quite busy. Service and food is very quick so once you are seated you will hardly notice. The crowd can be rowdy bringing a dive bar feel to this place.   Great place for sharables and tapas. My top tip is to make everything into a sharables so you get to try a bit of everything. The Unagi Rossoto was great but you wouldn't want to finish the whole thing when there is so much else to try!  A buck ($1) a shuck oysters on Tuesdays and Wednesdays. They are nice and fresh but save bingeing for an oyster bar. Oysters are not the highlight here and it's a shame to miss out on everything else.   The environment is very fun and trendy. Great for dates but is far from intimate. I would say save it for boys/girls night and double/triple dates.   I will definitely come back with a group for tapas. Ask your servers for the best sellers. Regulars know best in this case."}
{"text":"Been here many times since they opened and I can confidently say that their food and service is consistently good. By now, I'm sure everyone is aware of their dollar oysters on Tuesday and Wednesday so be sure to make a reservation online (not confirmed until they call you) to secure a table.  They offer more of a westernized izakaya as opposed to Japanese fare. We usually order the unagi risotto, fried prawn, yam fries (not a fan of their house sauce), baked oyster, wara yaki and a few more items (I think I almost tried each item off their menu). They have a large selection of drinks and their bartender is super competent and friendly.  The waitress have all mastered the RBF but are genuinely nice people and checked up on us a few times during dinner. We really enjoyed our super late (10pm) dinner here on Friday and the DJ played some awesome throw backs and new music (hip hop, rnb and rap) and later switched to edm."}
{"text":"I have a love hate relationship with this place, sometimes when I come, I feel like the food is a bit disappointing and too expensive, but other times I'm very satisfied with the meal. I tend to visit Nome on a Tuesday or Wednesday for their $1 oyster special (which you almost always need a reservation unless you're willing to wait an hour). I've also noticed that the food doesn't seem as good when they are busy, and the service is definitely more rushed and I tend to leave a bit unsatisfied with the meal. However, when I visited on a Sunday, the place was much less crowded and I found the food to be better prepared which made all the difference. I have noticed that their service is not the best, as it takes a while for the waiters/waitresses to notice that you're trying to get their attention.   Overall, my favourite dishes from Nome are the tako wasabi (raw octopus in wasabi sauce), the tiger shrimp (battered and friend shrimp in a creamy spicy sauce), the Mack-attack (seared mackerel and the japaburger.   I also enjoy their miso black cod, but I feel like there are other spots that do it better for $10.80."}
{"text":"What more can I say about this place? I'm here at least once a week and have now tried pretty much everything on the menu. Awesome vibe, not f*kin noisy like Guu down the road (where idiots keep screaming every time someone comes in or leaves - btw I know why they do this, but this ain't Japan and it ain't even close if they're trying to get brownie points - focus on the food for starters!!), quality and tasty food, good service from eye candy servers, and although a bit pricey, i think the quality of food and ambience somewhat justifies the higher prices. Don't like the prices? Sod off to cheaper digs, it's hard to get a seat in this place as it is. I could do with less competition.  People ask me about the oyster specials on Tuesday and Wednesday. All I can say is that only Malpeque oysters are discounted ($1 each), which is a grand shame, but if you like skinny ass limp Malpeques, then more power to you and go for it. I personally prefer the fatter n' creamier Fanny Bays or French Kiss, so I'm never there fighting the lame crowd on those days.   Nome gets a decent 4 star \"yum\" review from the Food B.   Taste: 4 (yum) Wait time: 4 (yum) Service: 4 (yum) Ambience: 5 (hell yeah) Value: 3 (meh)"}
{"text":"$ 1 oyster is really good and fresh!  Love the Japp Burger and Tiger Shrimp!  Deep fried pork belly and potato slices are really good too!"}
{"text":"3.5 Stars  Nomé has a nice buck-a-shuck special on Tuesdays and Wednesdays, and some of their other fusion items like the bulgogi tacos (combining Korean, Japanese, and Mexican flavours!) and Japas burgers are both delicious. Service is good, and everyone also looks very good which makes me feel a little bad since I do not :D   Their rolls and sashimi are serviceable too, but I think their cooked items are generally better (other than the oysters, which are awesome).   You can find a full review with more pictures on my blog, located in my profile!"}
{"text":"Food had ups and downs. Great sliders and fish but salad was just chips and mayo. I'm relatively satisfied with the food overall. Service was the worst part. Waitresses were full of attitude when we had issues with the bill and wanted to split. I even caught one rolling her eyes at the other behind us."}
{"text":"Great spot to spend some time with a bunch of good friends for drinks and yummy eats! Oysters, on special on Tues and Wed is such a great deal and really good. Good quality sake... drink it cold with oysters. Can't beat it!"}
{"text":"I enjoyed my time at Nome. Though I didn't think I would be stuffed by the end, I was quite wrong.  Expect a tapa-like experience, you're not going to get one full meal. I suggest getting their delicious Bulgogi Tacos and Duck Rolls. I also suggest their Malpeque Oysters (PEI), but go on Tuesday or Wednesday when it's a buck-a-shuck.  The service is incredible, and the atmosphere gives you a downtown vibe when you're really in North York.  Overall really good quality food, and amazing service. Expect to pay 50-60 per person (without drinks)."}
{"text":"A recommened place for oyster lover for sure. Many options for oysters and they are very fresh. It's almost the busiest restaruant on yonge. The mini burger is  very tasty and the apple maki sushi is their shef's recommendation too."}
{"text":"My little cousin took me out for my belated birthday dinner, and she decided on this izakaya for their buck-a-shuck night on Tuesdays and Wednesdays!  Every time I'm here, it's always really busy. So I recommend making reservations ahead of time.   {Tako Wasabi ~ raw octopus mixed with wasabi}  We started off with two tako wasabi (which is my FAVE appetizer so we had to get one each cause I didn't want to share ) The flavour is always delicious, but one thing is, I feel like they never give enough seaweed. Maybe that's just me trying to savour the amount as much as possible   {Korean Style Beef Sashimi (Tartare)}   I love fish sashimi, but could never bring myself to eat raw beef. I'm not sure why, but was always turned off by it every time I saw it. But this time I decided to give it a try! My cousin scooped some onto a fried flatbread/pita for me. I was scared...BUT IT WAS SO GOOD. I was expecting something totally different, but this was delicious! The flavour of the sauce and the beef; it was like eating Korean BBQ but not cooked yet.  So weird...but I think I'll be ordering this dish next time   {Malpeque Oysters}   A dozen oysters each! Their oysters are always fresh, and I never had a problem with it!   {Oden}   I was really excited to try this dish out, ever since I tried it in Japan. I loved the dashi broth, but was very disappointed in the fish cakes. The texture tasted like it was simmered in the soup for hours, it pretty much broke down when I poked at it. I expected the fish cake to be bouncy and a bit firm to there bite. Won't order this again"}
{"text":"I just came here last night and I already want to go back! The food is delicious! I love everything that we ordered. We came on a Tuesday night for the buck-a-shuck oysters and I couldn't believe how efficient they were. The oysters came out almost immediately, as there were three guys shucking non-stop all night long. Usually when you go for buck-a-shuck oysters, they take forever to come out, but not here! That way I could order one dozen at a time instead of all at once, without being hesitant about how long it might take.  The atmosphere is lively, but definitely not as loud as Guu, which is nice to not have my ears buzzing from all the yelling around the restaurant. You definitely need a reservation if you're coming on Tuesday or Wednesday because of the buck-a-shuck oysters. However, since we didn't have a reservation, we could sit at the bar and it actually was pretty comfy. The counters are pretty spacious and there are proper chairs instead of stools. I actually think I prefer the bar seats over the tables as its cozier to sit next to your date.  As for food, along with the oysters we ordered the japa burgers, aburi salmon donburi and sashimi salad. Let me start with the japa burgers- these are DELICIOUS! The flavour is amazing. Usually I'm not a huge burger fan, but these definitely wow-ed me. It definitely goes on my must-order list here. I was a little hesitant to order the aburi salmon donburi, but I'm glad I did! This one surprised me with how good it is, and they also give a very generous portion of salmon! This is also a must-try. The sashimi salad was good too, its a nice change from just the typical sashimi plate, however I'll probably try some other sashimi dish if I come back. It didn't 'wow' me enough for me to want to order it again.  I already can't wait to come back! I want to try everything on the menu!"}
{"text":"Japanese fusion bar food, made creatively. Tasty dishes likened to tapas. Served continually. I would recommend this place. Had a great time. I love watching UFC events there. They just opened a patio upstairs and I am looking forward to trying their drinks. I hope they are just as creative as the fare. Big up! to the owners. Final word.. Booyah!"}
{"text":"Japa Burgers is amazing. Buck-a-shuck ($1 oysters on Tuesday and Wednesday) is amazing. Edamame was amazing.  Foods are all very fresh. Granted, they are not the largest in portion size, but given the location and reasonable price, there isn't much to complain about. Green P parking right behind the restaurant.  Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"My first and only visit to Nome Izakaya (Nome moving forward) was like going to the gym - except for the inside of my stomach. The end goal was to get my stomach as flexible (read: stretched) as possible. How'd we plan on achieving this not so loft goal - I'm a seasoned stretcher at this point.  Well it wasn't going to be easy, we were going to order often, order a lot, get some help from the owner himself who offered to help spot us with some of the heavy lifting and take down sets of food while achieving PBs (personal bests) at each interval of training.  ***I need to make this review SOUND like I was exercising so that I don't feel as bad about all the food we consumed in one night (and in the days that followed due to leftovers).***  Due to the high volume of food, rather than go on and on about each item, I'm going to copy and paste from the menu directly and give brief comment on each item.  TAKOYAKI $ 5.50 Deep fried octopus ball served with tonkatsu sauce, mayo. KU - Loved these. Eat them hot the taste changes once they cool - not for the better  YAM FRIES $ 5.80 Deep fried sweet potato with a house dipping sauce. KU - they were OK, Yam fries, nothing wrong or crazy about them  JAPANESE CHICKEN POPPERS (KARA-AGE) $ 7.50 Japanese style fried chicken with wasabi mayo. KU - Loved these. OMG. I ate them for days after 10 stars.  CALAMARI (IKA FRY) $ 8.50 Deep fried calamari served with Japanese style tartar sauce. KU - Great taste, well cooked, excellent hot and fresh.  MARINATED BLACK COD (GINDARA NO YUAN YAKI) $ 10.80 Black Cod marinated with citrus soy sauce. KU - This was new for us to try and it was excellent. A small portion but amidst the rest of the food it was perfect.  JAPA-BURGERS $ 9.80 Nomé's original homemade sliders made with sliced rib eye meat and topped with tomato, spring mix, onion, smoky bbq sauce and garlic seasoning. KU - I would marry this burger if I wasn't already engaged. HOLY SHIT these were good.  FRESH OYSTERS $market price + was on special KU - Had a set of Fanny Bays and an assortment of others that were on special Too amazing for words  DESSERT $?? KU - Chef/owner brought us something special and off menu that I can't speak to other than it was amazing.  Some additional info worth noting: The venue isn't very big so be advised to either make a reso here or get there early. The staff are super good at their jobs and will be all over your order so don't hesitate to order up as much as you like - their minds are like steel traps of knowledge. I'd avoid the cocktails here TBH, not my scene even though they're popular, next time I'll stick with the Asian beers they have!  An amazing experience overall - big thanks to the owner for coming out to personally say hi and offered some complimentary snacks to try off the new menu (as if we needed any more food).  Eatcrest Out!"}
{"text":"Food is really good but overpriced. Service is slow and they always seem busy even when it's not. They forgot an order of sake, and gave us an extra order of fanny bay, which we gave back graciously.  The restaurant isn't very large but it is a good place to go to party with a small group.   Food portions are small and expensive. Everything felt more like a teaser then a full meal, but it is tapas."}
{"text":"Came here Wednesday evening and the wait was around 30 mins for the bar.  They had like 3-4 open tables but it seems to be all reserved.  So it is best to make reservation here when you go.  Oysters were $1 a price today we ordered around 22 of them. Pretty fresh and they gave you a whole tray of condiments as well.  Place is pretty hip and the servers are all dressed up like they are going clubbing.  No wonder guys love this place haha.  Also got the ungainly risotto which was not good.  The salmon donburi was tasty and salmon very fresh.  This is my 2nd time coming here. First time was when the first opened and a lot has changed for the better.  Will be back for more $1 Oysters"}
{"text":"Location/Service It's right along Yonge St, easily accessible via TTC.  Street/Green P parking is behind the restaurant.  Inside the restaurant has a lounge/bar vibe, quite trendy.  I believe they have DJ service on Friday nights - music can get a little loud, but brings out the mood.  The waitresses were friendly and helps with the ordering as much as they can.  Food I was in a party of 8 - so we ordered a lot of small tapa dishes to share (didn't had the time to take all pictures).  Sumarai Crunch - freshly baked and crunchy potato chips.  It pairs really well with the garlic mayo dressing provided.  Very good appetizer and starter for the meal, we finished it in no-time cause it was as addictive as regular chips!  Japa-Burgers - highly recommended!  It's rib eye meat made into a slider style.  The bbq sauce (which tasted similar to bulgogi sauce) made it the meat extra juicy and tender.  It's also a bit sweet, but not too overwhelming with the tomatoes, spring mix and onion added on.  Baked Oysters - oven baked with a spinach sauce.  If you're a fan of oysters, this one won't disappoint.  Sometimes baked oysters can get a little salty, but this one is a-ok.    Other great choices include - Tako Wasabi, Sashimi Salad, Big Beef Sushi Roll and Marinated Short Ribs.   Overall I really enjoyed Nome.  It has a good vibe if you want to chill at night or lounge with a few friends. They have a variety of drinks and cocktails.  I would definitely come back next time for their Happy Hour $1 Oysters!"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times now and I really enjoy it. It's got cheap eats, a nice vibe and good food."}
{"text":"One of the better izakaya's i've been to in that area. The first time I came across Nome, I was attracted by the 1$ oysters. The oysters are small in size, but good for its price (sauces are cocktail, horseradish, garlic, and soy sauce). I ended up going back to this place several times not only because of the oysters, but the rest of the menu was really worth trying. I would very highly recommend their 'Wara Yaki' (smoked&seared salmon), it gives me an extreme high every time. Lastly, their service is great, the waitresses are prompt at taking orders and are also very cute ^_^"}
{"text":"Came here on a week night around 11pm.  Pros: - Decently priced - Good service - $1 oysters on Tuesday/Wednesday  Cons: - Always packed"}
{"text":"This place is DELICIOUS. I loved every single thing that I ordered. There were 6 of us, myself included, and we had sat at the patio. I went on a Thursday night at 7:30 for my birthday. We had made reservations beforehand, otherwise I don't think we would have gotten in because it was very busy when I arrived with most tables being full. Here's what I had tried:  Lobster Fantasy Rolls Beef Tacos Some sort of shrimp with a chip underneath it Double Salmon Rolls Oysters (I'm not a fan of oysters in general but apparently they were really good) Short ribs, regular and spicy  There was not one thing I did not like. I would love to go again.   The main problem was the service. There was a lot of confusion, a lot of waiting, and some attitude. When we had first ordered, we had ordered the lobster fantasy and two orders of the tacos. Those came by very quickly. After that it went down hill from there. We had asked for another order of the lobster fantasy and they had taken about 20 minutes to get back to us with that. Everything we ordered from then on took around 20-25 minutes. Waiting for the dessert was just ridiculous..30 minutes for a small piece of cheescake! The staff seemed to be confused at times because there was a point where a server came up to us and asked us what we'd like to order, when we actually already placed an order with our actual server. I had also asked my server for a fork long before the food came because I cannot use chopsticks. She never brought the fork out. The food was already at the table and I had to ask someone else who took an extra 15 minutes just to get a fucking fork.  Our server had said she would take our menus from us once we placed the first order but none of us were ready to give it up yet. I'm not sure if there was a shortage of menus but she was very passive aggressive when we all told her we'd keep them. She had tried to take our menus multiple times throughout the night. My friend also had a few questions about the bill as well as where to pay (we were on the patio so the moneris does not have a service up there, so we had to go down and pay). She simply wanted to know where and who we had to go to in order to pay the bill and the server just seemed like she didn't want to answer any questions and just wanted to get out of our presence. Everyone at the table noticed it. Unfortunately I do not remember their names but I will definitely be going again (SIMPLY BECAUSE THE FOOD WAS THAT GOOD), and when I do I will be sure to find out the names of these servers."}
{"text":"Great and cozy place! I love the atmosphere. The oysters are alright, though I would rather shuck them myself. The japaburger is amazing! It is the dish the draws me back! Definitely make reservations, they are always packed.  Update: Came here again and realized I forgot to review their takoyaki. It is one of my favorite foods so I am very very picky with it. I would give them a 2.5/5. Can not really taste the squid.. Outer shell is too hard/ crisp. The skin kind of tasted like potatos which was an interesting touch. The sauce was not enough. The dish just lacked flavour and melt in your mouth chewiness"}
{"text":"I only ever visited here for their oyster specials and for those it's a great place to visit. $1 or close to that per oyster of reasonable quality are not easy to find so it's no surprise that the shop fills up very quickly on those weekdays they offer the special. They do take online reservations through open table so I highly recommend booking ahead instead of waiting in line.  They also have a limit of 2 hours per table during the oyster days (not sure if they also have the limit during other days). Which is typically a lot of time but they do get busy and service/food can get delayed quite a bit depending on how backlogged they are so if you are a large group I would recommend placing orders ahead if you are thinking of ordering more. If I didn't have to wait for 20-30 minutes for my oysters I would probably eat more of it. Come to think of it maybe they slow down the service so that people like me don't gorge on the stuff.  The quality of the oysters are pretty good and even after quite a number of visits I've never gotten sick yet, which is something I'm very wary of when having oysters, especially inland. I suggest mixing the value ones with some quality ones just to mix things up and have some variety on the plate. I think their multiple sauces for the oysters are cute too, although I stick to the boring ol horse radish and cocktail sauce most of the time."}
{"text":"It's been more than a year since I ate at Nome and ventured around the Yonge/Sheppard area. But thanks to my fellow Yelper friend Amy, she brought a lot of us together at one of her favourite spots! :)  We pretty much ordered in little separate groups. Since it has been awhile from my last visit, I don't recall anything haha. Nevertheless, I had my taste on their Japanese Chicken Poppers (karaage), Takoyaki, Japa-burger, and Chicken Wings.  What's awesome most about Nome is every Tuesday and Wednesday, they have $1 oyster deals! I ordered four Malpeque (PEI) oysters for a dollar each, and split ten Fanny Bay (Vancouver) oysters for $12 between two people. The Malpeque were much smaller in size and fresh. As for the Fanny Bay, they were really fat in comparison and you can definitely absorb the ocean taste. I enjoyed the Fanny Bays more but its tough to devour too many.  The karaage was fried crispy yet the meat was tender inside. My friends recommended the Japa-burger and it was not a let-down! It's basically mini sliders and the sauce was delicious. I think that's what made everything good. The chicken wings also tasted very juicy and saucy, little bit on the spicy side one - well fried too!  Takoyaki = must-get! They were so yummy! The surrounding flour wasn't too thick and texture was just perfect in comparison to its fried outer layer.  Overall, I loved my experience at Nome. We ordered Sake bombs and had so much fun!"}
{"text":"Definitely try their japa burgers. If possible, come on a Tuesday or Wednesday for cheap oysters. Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Amazing deal on the $1 oysters! The other dishes were good as well. The only thing is that the meat parties in the burgers are way too little and the aloe and yogurt sojus are very watered down."}
{"text":"Their food is good and love their oyster special! The environment is nice but when they are busy, it's overly crowed. Overall food, drinks, and music is good! Definitely will come back!"}
{"text":"To me, Izakayas are OK, but Nome Izakaya stood out from all others. There's nothing for me to complain about. Food was good, serving size was substantial, restaurant was clean, and the staff were attentive. I would come back and take my friends.   Food: - double salmon roll: may need two bites for each piece, generous serving size, raw salmon on top, cooked salmon inside.  - unagi risotto: may be overcooked for some but I enjoyed the creamy taste.  - bulgogi burgers: friends said it was good but they enjoyed the tacos more.  - beef tacos: heard it was better than the burgers, good beef to topping ratio.  - pork belly: heard it was good - sashimi salad: nice and light and fresh, came with a good amount of fresh sashimi.  - black bean edamame: surprisingly sweet, I'd wait till the end for more of a dessert taste.  - octopus balls: I haven't had a bad octopus ball, but there could have been more in a serving (comes in set of 5). - cactus chips and tornado chips: average; good sauces"}
{"text":"This is my first time here and it's awesome!  Great food and great service!  The manager Dave and bartender Zalina are amazing!  I came on a Friday night so was very busy, and had to sit at the bar. That was okay because the bartender, Zalina, was super attentive and helpful. Certain nights are DJ nights, so don't plan on having any quiet dinner conversations. The DJ played very upbeat music, and made it a very lively atmosphere.  Great place for drinks and food after a long week at work!  Will definitely have to come back again!"}
{"text":"Update: We went back on a deal day, so I thought to make an update based on service and new food items that I haven't already mentioned before.   The food -   Chicken wings Plentiful. The guy in our group liked these. I thought it was just okay. It came with hot sauce. Someone else in our group mentioned a different sauce would have been better.   Tuna coin  They came out cold and the bottom wasn't as crispy as it normally was.. I think the server just forgot to bring this out to us. I'll let it slide as the flavor was still good and Tuesday is a really busy night for them.   Takoyaki Five pieces. We all enjoyed these. They were a good size and up to our standards for takoyaki.  Tortilla bites A nice bite to have with a hit of heat in some, but not all of them. The dish comes with five pieces. I don't think I'll order this again.   Fanny bay, malpeque, kushhi and French kiss oysters We did 2 rounds of oysters (4 serving plates total). The sizes were a lot more consistent than on previous deal days. There was still some variances in size, but the range wasn't too far off to care. They set the expectation that the oysters would take about 20-25 mins to come out, but both rounds came out surprisingly quick. They all were shucked really clean, the staff must have a lot more experience with this now. We kept asking for fresh horseradish, which the staff always brought out with no issues.    We also got baked oysters, the beef sashimi, honey butter corn again. They were all consistent and as always, I will order these items again.   The service:  Everything that could have been a downfall for me, was fixed during this visit. First, I forgot to put a reservation down for us on one of their busiest nights (oops!).  Luckily, we were able to secure three good spots at the bar right away at 6:30 pm! The staff was welcoming and provided service whenever we needed it. They refilled water and brought more napkins and took away dirty/finished dishes quickly without us having to ask. They checked on us when we were looking at the menu, so we could order more right away. We also got our bill quickly and paying was smooth (split three ways). As a result, I gladly tipped them more than the last time.   Rumour: I overheard them saying they're opening a second location in May. Possibly in the don mills shops if my eavesdropping skills are on point, but it's so loud in there.. Who knows. If they do open there, I hope they stay consistent with their great food and service. I will definitely check it out if they do open there; especially since parking is FREE at don mills shops!"}
{"text":"My fave spot in GA hands down. Everything from the vibe to excellent original menu, fair priced drinks and friendly waitstaff, comfortable decor, terrific dj, they got it down on point. Highly recommended"}
{"text":"Best place to have $1 oysters! Their Fanny bay oysters are the best I've ever had! They're very flavourful."}
{"text":"Oysters are so dam good! I am not a oyster person, as sometimes they could be very fishy. Nome really did a good job on oysters! So fresh and tasty, I like them a lot this time. Other dishes are also delicious - beef tarter and Japa burgers!"}
{"text":"Great place for food n drinks ans just chilling with a big group of people.   Their setup allows for big group bookings which is the best."}
{"text":"Went here to try something new and was pleasantly surprised. Pretty similar to guu with the izakaya/tapas feel. We got the black cod and grilled squid which were both really flavourful. I thought that grilled squid could have used some rice or something to wipe up the sauce. We wanted to get the sea bass but they were out so went with the black cod. Not disappointed.   Lots of menu options so we will likely come back to try more of the stuff here, it is a bit over priced for portion size but I don't think it's unreasonable given the quality of the food."}
{"text":"WOW!  I dont think I have ever given a 5 star review,  but there is a first time for everything!  Went with some friends on a late Tuesday evening. I recommend making reservations as its quite busy.  Also Tuesdays is buck a shuck oysters so bring it on!  The food was absolutely amazing,  we tried about 10 different things on the menu and it was all outstanding.  One of those taste experiences that every foodie craves.  My favourite has to be the black cod, which was cooked to perfection. Oysters were also fresh, cleanly shucked and tasted great with the sauces provided and the Sapporo beer to complement.  Service was great and the ambience was even better.  I love the music,  the decor,  and the hustle and bustle of the place. Prices were also very fair.  All of these factors made up a solid 5 star rating for this restaurant.  Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Always a good to time at Nome! Great food, great oysters ( much better then before) alway live at nights and weekends! Do expect a line and a bit of a wait if its on oyster night!  We go here just to drink most the times, the environment is amazing and the staff are super friendly!  Highly recommend this spot!"}
{"text":"Love their oyster special! The Japanese foam beer is good too. My favorite is their shrimp udon salad. The jumbo shrimp and tempura Crumb are perfect in flavor :)"}
{"text":"Been here several times but it's getting worst and worst..... Every Tuesday and Wednesday is buck-a-oyster day, it is a great way to try all types of oysters they provide but don't have high expectation to the freshness. If there is one food must try, I would recommend their unagi risotto; taste good but price is $$$.  Service:  Food:  Atmosphere:  Price:"}
{"text":"(1.5*)  We ordered about 100 oysters on a Tuesday night because of the special (MALPEQUE Oysters are the only ones that are 1 for a $1). Also note that on the Oyster special days (Tues/Wed) you have a 2 hour sitting time I think. It was my first time eating raw oysters ever so my say on the taste has to be that some of them were fishy while you ate it, some had a fishy after taste, but all of them were salty, but ocean salty, which I liked. My favourite sauce has to be the garlic and lemon one because I loved how it brought out the subtle sweetness of the oysters.  The food was okay because we were really here for the oysters; the only memorable things were the Korean Raw Beef and the Abure Salmon Donburi. I've never had beef tartare before so maybe it was just bias for me that 'its one of their best dishes'. I really like the Salmon donburi because of the flavour (but its probably like kewpie mayonaise with garlic or smt/garlic aoili ontopof tthe raw salmon).   The rainbow-yuuke is their \"Salmon Natte Yuuke\" that is served at kinka; was a complete miss. Their natto wa super duper slimy and their salmon chunks were way too big so however you mixed it, little or alot, it all felt like boogers with occasionally once in a while the crisps appears for that little crunch. That dish really lacked texture and the taste was overpowered by the natto and huge salmon chunks, couldn't really taste anything else that was in there (the pickles).  The black cod was marinated sweetly which I liked but would've pereferred it tasted more savoury than sweet. The texture was somewhere in between a melt in your mouth feel and dry and flaky which was kind of just meh for me. After having black cod at Kinka I think that's why I'm being biased because I liked their buttery and savoury texture more.  The baked oysters were pretty good and buttery, but weren't great. I really think I should've just stuck to the raw oysters here as they were the real star of the show.  We also ordered Ginger Salmon, Takoyaki, and Spicy Ribs but I didn't get to try any of them so I can't really say but a friend told me the the Takoyaki was \"pretty good\", apparently the other two were just meh.  So save the best for last (kinda?), David is probably the best waiter who can wait your table so if you have a handsome korean guy serving you, you're in luck! He was literally the ONLY one who came to check up on our table and we all really appreciated it as it made our dining experience alot better. Especially near the end he asked out of the blue \"who's birthday it was\" (or maybe it was the homemade cheesecake a friend made for me was being eaten on the table that gave it away), and after leaving, he came back with a NY style cheesecake with a sparkler in it! That's what really saved this place from only having 2 stars or less tbh. Thank you so much for the birthday wishes!  Overall, avoid the ratchet and unfriendly 5'4 asian girl before she ruins your night, like seriously if you're not a server why are you on the dining floor, wear a badge or something so I shouldn't always have to try and flag down a server to want something and please don't be so rude about it. You're eyes were screaming \"please stfu and go away\". She was the bad aftertaste in our mouth that we ended talking about after at the Mcdonalds down the block lmao.  Don't think I'll ever come back unless i just want beer and raw oysters ;/  Edit: Uh i just realised they charged us an extra 42 dollars for idk what the fuck it was for??? Gratiuty????? Included tip???????? Maybe that's why that one girl was so stuck up cause she was going to earn her $$$ anyways lmao pics included someone please tell me Im imagining like kinka's got better quality and service and doesnt do this kinda shit."}
{"text":"Been here a couples of times now and I haven't had any bad experiences. This place is usually crowded and busy during dinner time for both weekdays and weekends. Atmosphere is relaxing, calm and quite clean. The service is decent however I do see a lot of flirting going on between servers and their customers while other customers wait paitiently to gain the waitress' attention - a little unprofessional. Other than that, food is great especially the baked oysters, japaburgers and the giant shrimps. This location is also one of the few in north york that sells the yogurt soju and the aloe soju so thats another plus! I definitely recommend this place and make sure to call ahead and reserve a spot to avoid lineups!"}
{"text":"Their eel risotto was incredible, cheesy risotto plus sweet eel, such a great combo.  The rolls and sashimi were delicious too. It is indeed a Japanese fusion restaurant, the dishes were so refreshing and delicious.  I like this place. It contains good vibe and memory."}
{"text":"The food here is hit or miss. Some dishes are great and others are very disappointing. Service was slow and person seating us seemed very disinterested. While some of the food was quite good, the high price was not worth the value. We went in the early evening and the music was quite loud and very clubby. I would say this is more of a place to go for drinks before you go clubbing, not a place for a proper dinner."}
{"text":"Good food, a tiny bit expensive (but as expected of izakaya places). I'd like to rate it 7.5/10 overall (not an average). 8/10 for service, 7.5/10 for the food, 6.5 for value.  Ordered buttered scalloped and shrimp (decent), baked oysters (great, but kinda small), Mac and cheese (bleh, not sure why my friend really wanted that lol), Beef ribs (great), Karage chicken (decent), unagi risotto (good, but only a small piece of unagi), octopus balls (great), and beef rolls (meh, barely any beef). Also ordered 1L of Yogurt Cocktail Soju (great).  For 3 people came to 40 dollars per person before tax. Felt kinda pricy for the amount of food, but again it was as expected.  In terms of atmosphere, it's mostly a westernized izakaya. Don't expect Asian waitresses or Asian music."}
{"text":"TUES AND WEDS: $1 OYSTERS! That's all you need to know.  Come here for their oysters either Tues or Wed (or if you want, both). They are fantastic, and there's plenty of other delicious items on their menu that you can order. If you are deciding between what to get: Bulgogi tacos or their Japa-burgers (both are $9.80), get the Japa burgers. The server may also ask if you wanted to add one more burger to the tray for $X. DO IT. I regret not doing it because the Japa-Burger was that good!  As it is tapas, you can order as the night goes on. So we order some oysters, then some apps, then back to oysters. I would recommend this if it's just two people. Our table was small and we certainly wouldn't have been able to fit all the food if we didn't order separately. If you can, make a reservation (as they get busy during their oyster nights)!"}
{"text":"Hmmm, I'm not sure I understand the hype... I came here for a friend's brithday, and it was just expensive... We had the whole second floor to ourselves, which was nice.  The food and drinks were all way over priced in my opinion and the portions were also quite small. If I didn't get hungry, I would not have gotten anything.  The service was hit or miss depending on who you got, but all the girls here do have a certain look, so it was a little hard to discern between them. One or two of them were definitely not enjoying their evenings, and it showed in their service.  It was a fun evening with friends, but I would not go back."}
{"text":"Nome equals not enough food!!! Dishes are pricey and extremely small! Being here a second time I had forgotten why I didn't like it the first time so decided to give it a second chance.   Came here with a bunch of friends, being a bit hungry we ordered 1) Warayaki (one of my fav dishes). It was extremely small in size but not in price with only 5 pieces, compared to 8-10 found at other Izakayas such as don don or yuzu. Had the 2) marinated black cod which lacked flavour and was also very small portion. The cod didn't seem fresh in terms of the texture and I didn't really taste the citrus flavours it boasts. Tried the 3) Takoyaki again and seems mediocre, nothing special. 4) Karage was also much smaller portions, and resembled popcorn chicken with a wasabi mayo which was okay. 5) the Maguro and Avocado Tartare was the most shocking to us since it was soooooooo small it looked like a plate of cat food. Sitting at the price of 10 dollars if you round up the 9.70, it's ridiculous they can serve us such a small portion and its not all tuna it's mixed with avocado cut up in these small pieces. We were all picking at this dish like we were really poor and had nothing to eat.  The dishes although small were tasty. The only bigger dish we got was the shrimp udon salad which had a unique fresh flavour I liked. The oysters are cheap on tues and wed and I guess that's why most ppl gave them good reviews. If you don't like oysters this might not be the place for you. Also when we were there their oven was broken so we didn't get to try their Unagi risotto and baked oyster which affected their score for sure. I recalled last time I came here their scallop and shrimp was pretty small as well. I know generally Izakaya dishes are small but relatively speaking this is beyond small compared to other places. So really I am reluctant but I give them 2.5 stars. 1 for flavour, 1 for atmosphere (it was pretty lively there with good music) and maybe 0.5 for service it was alright. Paid parking in back and side streets. Don't come hungry!"}
{"text":"We planned to go to Han Ba Tang a few doors away (my personal favorite), but figured we should give this place a try.  - First good impression: nice decor.  - First bad impression: the tables are too close to each other. Our table was 6-7\" away from the next ones. The space was only enough for my wife to squeeze into the bench. I can hear everything people say within 3 tables radius. I'm sure they feel the same.  - Service: ok, on the positive side. They come fairly often to take away empty plates and ask what else we wanted.  - Food: the two of us tried 5 dishes:       - Sashimi mash: the cuts were so small ....      - Monk fish tacos: fairly bland, need additional sauce. The veggies in those tacos are all over the places, and don't go well together, imo.      - Japa-burger (this was highly recommended by the waitress): too sweet, the buns were so dry or overly toasted.      - Beef tartar: also too sweet. I felt like eating some kinda candy.      - Double salmon roll (this was highly recommended by the waitress): bland and nothing special (but somehow cost $14). After reading the menu again for reviewing purpose, I think they might have forgotten to put on the horse radish mayo sauce.  - Drinks: we ordered blue samurai + red sangria. They are ok. I don't feel too bad about the drinks cuz of the half price sangria and 5$ cocktails they have on special.  - Cost: 72$ (not including tips). With the mediocre food & drink, I felt ripped off..."}
{"text":"I went to one of the oyster nights. However I was tempted to get another tapas dish, I think the takoyaki and although I thought they couldn't possibly fill me up (just six of them afterall) when I left I wasn't sure I could go have dinner at home anymore.  The dishes are quite deceptive, and very delicious. Only reasons I'm not giving a five star review: no hooks under the bar for stuff, it made the experience uncomfortable. Also, while the staff was extremely nice, the constant checking is a turn off if you go alone. Lastly, issues with the machine at the time of paying. But these are all little pet peeves, if you come here for food, giod service and atmosphere and you'll find both very enjoyable. Note music and busy nights make it not the best for conversation."}
{"text":"Reason for my three stars is because of the terrible experience we had first time going. The staff there are generally good people and very friendly accept for the one we had. We had waited 1 hour to get in, only to be seated at the bar. Which is fine, although half way through our meal they asked us to move so that they could seat somebody else where we were. My boyfriend and I disagreed and said it was very rude and not fair for us to move for people who arrived after us. From there on in our waitress decided to ask us again but in a rude tone and arguing with us why we won't move. Then proceeds to talk to everybody about is not moving for them in front of our faces and gossiping. Very rude of this girl to do so.   We really enjoyed the food, it is the best tasting izakaya we have had in the city. Although the service staff I cannot say makes me want to come back to their establishment again."}
{"text":"Go to spot for when I'm in the area! I always get the Japa Burgers, Bulgogi Tacos, and Mac n Cheese. Those three dishes are hands down my fave from Nome.  The food usually arrives pretty slow (ngl) but it is always packed so that may explain why. Servers are nice and try their best to accommodate.  Overall, this place is a must try!"}
{"text":"I love the atmosphere there, food was nice and the music was good too. I enjoy having fun with my friends there on Friday."}
{"text":"Great place to just sit down and drink with friends in a busy and lively place. They have huge pints of beer or pitchers to share. Either way, prepare to call a cab at the end of it.   There is also karaoke across the street for some more late night fun. The wait to get in might be long since they are always busy. It is also crowded so there's some difficulties getting to the washroom."}
{"text":"I went with a group of friends and we were inforemd when we go there that we only had 2 hours time limit.  That was my friends birthday and we were planning to eat and drink there. It is supposed to be a IZAKAYA and peopel go there eat and drink. I never see any izakaya in town has this time limit rules!  Food: Since this place is not open by real japanese people, the food is just like regular food. Nothing special. Cant compare to guu or any other izakaya. Most food items are deep fried and food selection is limited.  Price: it is very pricy compared to other izakaya. our bill was $250 for 6 people (girls) and we were not that full! and we only ordered beers as drinks. not even any fancy items.   Location is good; waitress are hot; i guess thats why it is packed during a friday night.   But dont expect you will get a real izakaya experience here. I definately wont go back!"}
{"text":"This place impresses every time.... I've yet to order something on the menu that I don't like!  A must try: - Creamy Mentai Crispy Potatoes - Bulgogi Tacos - Double Salmon Sushi Roll - Sashimi Salad  5+!!"}
{"text":"Amazing. Had some recommended warm Saki coupled with a chefs special double salmon roll and a ginger roll. Wow this place is amazing"}
{"text":"Called to book reservation, was kinda put on hold right away for about 4 to 5mins. After confirm booking we headed there on time. Waited for table to be set, was quite pack inside for a sunday night after 9pm.  Order a wasabi taco, raw octopus chopped into small pieces marinated in wasabi sauce. I found that this time it was a bit too spicy. Recommend maybe less wasabi would be better.   Shrimp udon salad dish was a nice dish. A cold salad marinated  in a wasabi, soy sauce, lemon, sugar and vinegar sauce. It had a few crisppy sort of chip on top of the salad to give the salad a crunchy texture. Love it wanted more. The type of udon they used was nice, i think its the same ones you can find at the supermarket  at the frozen section. The udon was very nice and chewy. Love that and the taste of the sauce with the shrimp was very tasty.   The korean bulgogi taco was pretty nice. I love korean food so this was pretty good. Thenmeat was nicely  marinated with the sweet onion and some fresh thingly sliced pepper gave the taco the crunch.   The oyster shooter combo, consisted  4 oysters on top of 4 shooter glass each with different beer. One shoot was a bloody Caesar type of cocktail spicy.  Oysters were very fresh, medium size oysters  The bill after tip was about $53. Nice environment had the football game playing as well. I'll  be back for the udon salad and bulgogi tacos. I saw the fish taco the table beside mine and it look yummy. I will try that as well next time"}
{"text":"The sliders are great, but it's mainly because of the sauce they use - not the meat. But what's even better is the shrimp. Pricey, but worth it. The oysters on dollar oyster day are really crappy, tiny, and not worth it at all. You're better off getting the regular oysters. The environment is nice. Lights are dimmed quite low, and the service is good. Fun for a group of friends during the week."}
{"text":"Currently my all time favorite, go-to restaurant. Been there a handful of times for their \"buck-a-shuck\" nights. So worth it. I'm obsessed with oysters so this is one of the best deals closest to me. The restaurant is always busy and small. The seating isn't the most comfortable. Regardless, I highly recommend a reservation on their oyster nights which is on Tuesday and Wednesday.   The hostesses need more customer service and organization training. The servers on the other hand are on point.   Now onto the most important thing - food: delicious! Other than the oysters, there's the bulgogi sliders which are amazing, the tiger shrimp are also a must-get, and the honey bread. I ALWAYS get these three items along with a few others but these, to me, are the ones worth mentioning.  I highly recommend Nome!"}
{"text":"This is a great bar to hang out with friends. It is usually packed on weekend nights and there is even a live Dj on friday/saturday nights. I would recommend the japaburger, unagi risotto, and the buck a shuck ($1 oysters on tues/weds). As for beverages, the sapporo polar (not sure the exact name, but ask for the beer with the frozen/slushie top) and flaming lambo. The waiters/tresses are friendly and the crowd is 20-40's. However, make sure to call ahead for a reservation if you are thinking of visiting on a weekend night!"}
{"text":"No other restaurant has beat Nome's ebimayo. Their other dishes are excellent too and it's a fun environment to grab some drinks.   Only downside is it's really busy here. Reservations are recommended or else you might end up waiting quite a bit"}
{"text":"Great place if you like some authentic East Asian alchohol. It's the best place in the area to go for a night out. they have cheesecake from the cheesecake factory if you'd like to indulge in something sweet!"}
{"text":"Wow, I really enjoyed my meal here.   The place has a great atmosphere. It's cozy and a little upscale, without being stuffy. They have a great drinks list with nearly anything you might want: sangria, specialty cocktails, lots of beer and lots of sake.   The service is fantastic, with our server giving us advice on what to get, and how to order for our party of 9.   Standouts:  - Tiger shrimp: I'm not even a big fan of shrimp, and these were absolutely fantastic - Japa-burger: great bun, very good beef, and a good order to get if you have someone in your party who is new, or not a big fan of, Japanese food - Sashimi salad: I loved the sesame dressing, and whatever was crunchy in there. The sashimi was very good, as well - Deep fried pork belly: requires no explanation  Other items we had: - Marinated short ribs: not bad, but nothing particularly special about these - Chicken wings: in my opinion, too much breading. The hot sauce was indeed hot, and very tasty, though - Deep fried calimari: again, heavy on the breading. They were as big as onion rings. - Tuna coin: not bad, but I'm not a huge fan of tuna  We had a large party and they gave us half a dozen malpeque oysters on the house, which was awesome.   I think I'll definitely come back on $1 oyster day (Tuesdays and Wednesdays).  There's paid parking in the back, at $1.75/half hour ($6 max for the night) and Green P parking on the sidestreets behind at $3/hour."}
{"text":"Overall food = 3.5/5 BUT THAT TAKOYAKI THO = 5/5 Service = 5/5  Since this is an izakaya, you can expect your meal to be on the pricier side and the portions to be smaller. That aside, I was quite content with my meal tonight. We ordered 5 dishes and here's how I would rate them. BEST = takoyaki because they were fresh and hot, had sizable chunks of octopus, and were drizzled in a yummy teriyaki sauce. INTERESTING = the Japa-burgers which had a slight crunch to them, and the deep fried pork belly which was essentially a mouthful of deep-fried fat. MEDIOCRE = buttered scallop and shrimp and the 15pc sashimi platter which weren't bad but I've definitely had better before (and ironically, these two were the more expensive dishes).  The service was spot on. The waitresses were prompt, friendly, and considerate. Coming from core Toronto though, this location is a bit far for me so it's unlikely that I'll return. However, I'll probably continue to praise their takoyaki as the best I've had to date."}
{"text":"I only come here on Tuesdays and Wednesdays for their amazing buck a shuck deal on oysters! Love it!  My other go to dishes are the japaburgers, grilled squid, takoyaki, and maki rolls. All very delicious and high quality!  Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"As you will see from some of  my other reviews, this strip of Yonge st and Sheppard, up to Yonge and Finch is a frequent area because my family has lived here and I have seen it change so much.  Nome Izakaya is the best thing to happen to this area. I almost do not want to write a review because it is my best kept secret.   Think about it : Uptown, cheap or free parking, great food, beautiful lounge, hiphop music, ufc, basketball on huge clear TV's that do not interrupt the amazing hip decor. Unreal.  This is a place for a young, hip crowd, but not at all pretentious.   Sharing plates: - japa burger - very good -spicy octopus -okay - calamari - okay - COW TONGUE - first time having it, not a fan but I heard it is a delicacy  - fried pork belly -very good - tiger shrimp - very good - oysters - amazing  Drinks: Drinks were off the hook, the names are exotic but one that stands out was ciroc, milk and peach snapps. The Sake is great.  Service: servers are very hot import model look alikes. Nice. Spoke to the manager or owner named Pat. He is SO hospitable and nice.  Space: Very nicely minimal decor. Nice set up. It is a long restaurant and narrow. I think the capacity comfy would be 40 or less.  Price: Medium. Could be a lot if you do not ration the food you may order. and then the drinks.  This place is super fly and one time I was here and a dj started setting up playing some sick hiphop. This could only work in this area. If they opened anywhere else it would be trashed so easily or it would be way over priced.  I love this place:)"}
{"text":"Nome Izakaya is great! I come here all the time with friends. Although the place can get quite loud, the atmosphere is great. It's a great place to unwind after a long day.   In terms of service, it is pretty darn close to perfect. I've been a server for many years and the service here is wonderful. I went about a month ago, and encountered a few issues with my beer (lipstick on the glass and a fruit fly in the pitcher). The server and manager were very attentive and quickly fixed the problem and even gave us a pitcher on the house. Even though this place can get really busy, the servers are constantly checking up on you to make sure everything is okay (not in the annoying type of way).  The food is awesome! I've tried the sashimi salad, yam fries, almost every type of oyster they have, japa burgers, bulgogi tacos, mac and cheese and other things as well, and I can say that everything I've ever had at Nome was amazing!   It's safe to say that this place is great, and everyone should experience it!"}
{"text":"I was here for a friend's birthday party and I was really excited to try this place out! We had reservations so we were seating right away when we walked in. Being that it was a Monday it was definitely really packed.  The ambience of the restaurant was Asian inspired and they had booth seats with wooden tables and a bar at the back of the restaurant.  I would also like to add that their washrooms were very clean and nicely decorated, which was an added bonus.  We all looked through the menu and ordered a bunch of dishes which we all shared.  We went on a Monday and we got their daily special, which was a pitcher of Sapporo and their famous Japa Burger to start.  The waitress that was serving us was kind of slow at getting water for the table and we had a couple of hostesses that helped out with our table because it was so busy.  We did have to ask for water at least twice before getting served a pitcher of water.  When we finally were ready to order, we flagged our waitress down and ordered their Unagi Risotto, Creamy Mentai, Grilled Marinated Squid, California Style Sashimi Donburi, Baked Oysters, Deep Fried Oyster Tempura, and Spicy Short Ribs.  My favourites which I also recommend are the Creamy Mentai, Japa Burgers, and California Style Sashimi.  At the very end, the birthday boy got his Birthday Cake which was a slice of cheesecake from the Original Cheesecake Factory.  I cannot explain to you the flavour, taste, and texture of every dish because you need to try it for yourself!  All the food was so delicious and fresh!  I was in absolute bliss after every bite and surprisingly I was pretty full considering all their dishes were tapas.  I am planning to become a regular at this restaruant and I plan to tell everyone about Nomé."}
{"text":"First off, better than Guu. Hands down. Old school hip hop, beautiful ladies, good customer service, nice ambiance. You need to get reservation or come before 7pm, by 8pm it starts to get crowded.  Rating 1 as being crap, 5 as delicious:  Butter shrimp and scallop - 3 mediocre Beef sashimi - 4 creamy, did not like the chips that came with Pork belly - 5 so tender, crispy. Can't go wrong with fatty pork :) Chilean sea bass - 4 fish was cooked perfectly, so buttery. A little bland Japa burger - 1 just a regular plain burger. Expected some twist, nothing.  Malpeques oysters - 5 fresh, cold, can't mess it up!  Tiger shrimp - 3 it's okay, served with shrimp chips so that was cool Unagi risotto - 5 love Unagi, love risotto. Together is a fantastic creamy sweet combination.  Calamari - 4 good crisp to it, nothing out of the ordinary Spicy short ribs - 5 love it, tasted like Vietnamese bbq short ribs wit ha twist!   Drinks  Mango mojito and kiwi mojito SO GOOD.  Pitcher of Sapporo (18$) good price.  Will definitely go back again. :)"}
{"text":"After reading the reviews at this place, I thought I would check this place out. I love izakaya places, and thought that this was a place that I could go and enjoy.  Overall, the place is kinda small. The atmosphere in the place is great, and everyone seems to smile a lot. The staff is very friendly, so it is a good plus.   In terms of the food, I can say that the jap burgers were great, so was the deep fried pork belly. I would not recommend the honey chips (or whatever their called) because it wasn't impressive (felt like vicky's chips with honey butter dip). But other than that, the food was pretty good. Ordered the spare ribs, and the calamari, and that was pretty good as well. Nothing fantastic to write home about, but not too bad either.   I would recommend not going on a weekend. I have tried to go on a weekend before, but they are usually packed. I went on a weeknight, and it was still full, but we were able to sit at the sushi bar."}
{"text":"Great izakaya! Love the atmosphere, great service,  and the food is amaaaazzzzingggg!"}
{"text":"Came here a lot before and I have to say with my recent visit, this place is still great. This place is always busy, especially during their oyster deal nights.   It is a bar setting with DJs on weekend nights, it's a great place to hang with friends.   Recently I've had their oysters (must get!), japa sliders, bulgolgi tacos and apple salmon rolls (quite big rolls). No complains on the food- I'd recommend any of those dishes to anyone. Service wasn't bad either even though it was quite busy when we went.  Tapa style foods so they are shareable dishes. Prices are not bad.... but it's also not easy on the wallet lol. Anyway, it's the place to come to when you want to have fun with your friends."}
{"text":"Gluten-free review:  I went here for a birthday with 10ish people. The food was great and there were a lot of gluten-free options. I had the sashimi, yam fries, sliced potatoes with cod roe sauce, tako wasabi, and oysters. The house sake is good too, especially warmed up. For dessert they have a number of different ice creams and a gluten-free double chocolate godiva cheesecake. OMG!  For larger groups they put everyone's bill on the same receipt so make sure you bring cash. But you can pay for your potion with credit/debit too.   Note that I have a moderate intolerance so if you have celiac's disease I don't know what the cross-contamination is like here. I did not have a reaction to any of the food though."}
{"text":"I love tapas bars like  this .. It was my first time and my friend and i really enjoyed it.   Edamame was FANTASTIC.  Baked oyster was pretty good.  Grilled squid was really good.  Kalbi was very tasty.   Place is not too big, and very busy at night times. You gotta be ready to sit side by side with other people, a tad too close. But you make do when you want u some tapas u know?   Haha.  Thumbs up  Pictures will follow"}
{"text":"We came here on a Tuesday night with 5 in our group for the oyster special - they were delicious and all the sauces that came with it were a bonus.   Not only did we order 60 oysters, on top of that we also had the japa burgers which were very tasty for sliders and are recommended. Takowasa aka takowasabi on their menu is a slippery and slimmy starter that seems gross but is extremely delectable . I've had this elsewhere and it seems to be on par with most other restaurants and vice versa - the price although is a bit more expensive than other places we've been to. The tuna sashimi was a little above average to me due to the flavouring.   We also ordered the udon soup (had to add the noodles) which was fine with us since it tasted very soft and fresh. Along with short ribs and the unagi risotto . they were all very delicious and well prepared and seasoned.  The reason why I have 4 stars instead of 5 was based on service. I wish our server told us about the noodles and that they weren't just regular udon noodles you find everywhere else- it would've been a plus. And the broth from the soup was amazing - it's like instant soup but without the msg! Also, I've seen a few reviews about the hostess and we've been here before but only noticed it recently that she has an attitude . probably not good for business when the face of the restaurant is bitchy...just saying - from an observer watching the front of the restaurant..."}
{"text":"I should probably write a review about this place because I've been coming here for awhile now and enjoy all the food. Great atmosphere, a little loud for socializing because of its crowded and loud atmosphere, but very chill. I love the food here and I don't think they are pricey at all. In fact, of all the Izakayas I've been do, I definitely find this please the cheapest. The portions are not that small compared to others (i.e. Kingyo) and the prices are very reasonable. I love getting their oysters (especially on Tuesdays and Wednesdays when they're on specials). Really like the Japa burgers. It reminds me a lot of the  Japadogs in Vancouver.  Same concept, same deliciousness. I also love their takoyaki, of course (even though they had so little of the bonito flakes last time I checked). What was surprisingly good was the risotto...that is comfort food at its finest. Their k kalbi is also really good, full of flavour. They also have baked potato chips with the mayo sauce...I forgot what exactly it was but that's like crack...try it next time you visit. There are definitely a lot of things that I love at this place...I can't name all of them but they were all great.   Good place for a group. Shareable plates. I love this place."}
{"text":"WOW! Do I love this place or do I love this place? I'm in this neighbourhood a lot since my friend literally lives across the street. So I'm surprised  I recently found out about Nomé.  My friend took me here on a Saturday night and it was crazy busy! The restaurant itself is quite small. The décor is minimal and modern with a hint of traditional Japanese designs.   The food is P-H-E-N-O-M-E-N-A-L. I've been to a lot of Japanese tapas-type restaurants (Guu, Kinka, Zakkushi etc.) and this place is by far my favourite.   We ordered the Unagi Risotto, Japa Burger, Takoyaki and Lobster Fantasy Roll. My top two favourite would have to be the Unagi Risotto and the Japa Burger - it was unreal!  ***TIP*** - Highly, highly, recommend this place and I also *highly* recommend you make reservations ahead of time since this place gets really busy on the weekends.  Can't wait to go back *heart eyes emoji*"}
{"text":"This place is loud and dark. Sometimes they play weird music with bad DJ remixes. The food is so so but pricey, not worth the money as the portions are small too. Kinka izakaya is much better in my opinion; brighter room, better service, and tastier food for similar price."}
{"text":"It was my first time trying and had high expectation as heard so many things about it. I think it wasn't Amazing but was still good. Was much more modern and louder than expected.  Had double salmon roll ($14, wasnt the largest portion or enough salmon for the price. average 3); deep fried pork belly (nothing like I expected but was very tasty. Probably so fattening as its deep fried pork belly lol but the seaweed sauce and crispness was nice. $7.5, good 4); and french kiss oysters (didn't try all the other ones so I'm not sure if this is a good quality or not. Didn't have much meat tho $2.8/pc); tiger shrimp (was very nice. Shrimp was big and fresh. Would've preferred more mayo-ness but menu does say it's with sweet chilly sauce. Good crispy batter 4.5).    The service was enough attentiveness.   Maybe I will give buck a shuck night a try."}
{"text":"Love this place. Definitely need to make an appointment on Tuesday & Wednesday for their Oyster special.  However, the only thing disappointed me last time was the one blond girl server there treated our table so rude. She didn't want to do our order, and ignoring our request all the time."}
{"text":"Sake bomb and tuna coin is a must try!!!! If you can't take spicy, tuna coin is not for you.... and you are missing out!"}
{"text":"Decor - 4/5  I like it!  Warm wood tones that try very hard to mimic the ambiance of Japanese Izakaya back in Japan.  It's immediately comforting - not quite like the ones done in Japan, but it still works and works very well.  Food - 3.5/5  A bit disappointing compared to Guu Izakaya's offerings and portions.  Somethings were good and others were not.  In the end, most of the offerings were easily forgotten - nothing really stands out.  The oysters are fresh on Tuesdays and Wednesdays and for $1 each, I am told it's a good deal.  I'm not a shell fish fan so I can't say either way.  Others seem to enjoy it.  Price - 3/5  For the portions, the price is high.  Guu charges similar pricing, but the portions are bigger.  The X-Factor  My friends like going here because of the young Korean and Chinese ladies who show up to eat the $1 Oysters on Tuesday and Wednesday nights.  I guess it's a good place to come to if you enjoy the eye candy and don't care as much for the food.  Overall - nothing special.  I usually go if someone else organizes a meetup there.  I don't care for the Izakaya as I find they are average in taste.  Go for the $1 Oysters or the eye candy;  the food is not the reason you would patronize this joint."}
{"text":"Hmm, Been here once for my friend's bday. I genuinely enjoyed this place. In truth, I'm not a big fan of Japanese food. I had my doubts coming here to eat in terms of price/portion. I was expecting the price to be high, since most Japanese restaurants are in Toronto. The price was definitely high, but to my avail, the food was exceptionally fresh. We ordered two of each dish, so everyone got enough. I have to say the food was perfect, even for someone who doesn't prefer Japanese food.   The other thing I really like is the atmosphere. It's dim and very cozy, something I like over the other Japanese restaurants. It had a very modern and also traditional mood to it, love it a lot! Highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Finally got to try this Japanese Tapas bar! The main reason why we came here is for the buck a shuck oysters which is only on Tuesdays and Wednesdays. And I must say the oysters were pretty good considering the price! Fresh, juicy, and pretty bit in size. The $1 oysters offered were the malpaque and you could also upgrade to $2 oysters   (can't remember where they were from) but they were pretty good. We ordered about 75 oysters for the 7 of us and also some dishes to share. My favourite was the korean bulgogi tacos, probably one of the best meat tacos i've had! So flavourful and the portion size was good. We also ordered yam fries, chicken poppers (also delicious), sweet and spicy ribs and the japa burgers!. And can't forget the sake bombs, definitely not your typical shot because it gets messy hence the name. Lol. All the food tasted delicious especially the oysters! If you come here on a buck a shuck night make sure you make reservations as it gets pretty packed by 6-7pm. Parking is also not the best, it's a paid parking lot at the back of the restaurant.  Definitely coming back here for another oyster night!"}
{"text":"An Izakaya with exciting flavours and fresh oysters. A lot of Asian themed items on their menu will keep anyone happy (such as japa burgers, bulgogi tacos, fried shrimp). Beer is reasonably priced and so are the oysters. I recommend booking a spot if you plan on dropping in Tuesday or Wednesday."}
{"text":"I've been coming here every Wednesday for a month straight. Always busy, especially on Tuesday and Wednesday night because they have their dollar oyster special.   I would highly recommend their grilled black cod, oysters, japa burgers, and sashimi salad. However, their staff aren't that attentive, doesn't refill your water unless you ask for it.   Another think that I want to note is that they're open relatively late (2PM), but their last calls are at 1PM. Great music and atmosphere for those game nights."}
{"text":"Great service, great ambiance. Get the jap burger. I didn't have high expectations since I'm not a huge fan of sliders, but these were REALLY good."}
{"text":"I came here on a Friday night with some friends. We were seated upstairs, which is a quieter area and made it easier for conversations. We ordered deep fried pork belly, aburi salmon, tako wasabi, Korean style beef sashimi, 21 piece assorted sashimi, buttered scallop & shrimp and the kara-age.   Deep fried pork belly - crispy on the outside and juicy inside Aburi salmon - seared just right but the portion is on the smaller side Tako wasabi - your average tako wasabi, nothing special Korean style beef sashimi - amazingly delicious. I have never tried anything like this. This is a must try. Asorted sashimi - fresh but also quite pricey Buttered scallop & shrimp - sauce was really good, really buttery with hint of lemon. Scallop was cooked just right Kara-age - came with wasabi mayo, the meat was very juicy inside  The cheque came up to be around $90 for 4 people, but we were still a little hungry and ended up going to another restaurant after. But overall, food was delicious, service was average, and the environment was nice and relaxing. I would recommend this place if you're in the area."}
{"text":"Came during a Tuesday so it was packed but we made reservations. We were seated immediately at our reserved time and were even accommodated when asked for seats further away from the door. Food was ok and service was alright. had to ask multiple times for the sauces for our oysters but that's my only complaint for the night. Only memorable part of the night were the cheap oysters, the rest of the food was ok. very pricey for mediocre you get."}
{"text":"Came here for an UYE that was organized by Amy Z. We started off with some mini burgers and a Sapporo pitcher. Then ordered some oysters.  I was quite amazed by how delicious those mini burgers were. Gourmet style oysters that I didn't expect from a bar. Prices are reasonable.  We finished off the night with Sake bombs. Great night with a great company. I'm surely coming back for more."}
{"text":"Their food quality top notch. Typical Japanese izakaya that does not stop introducing new fusion style food such as Japa (mini) burgers, fried pork belly and their oyster is great as well. I really liked their atmosphere"}
{"text":"Fantastic experience - the food is just too good! We ordered everything from sushi rolls to sliders. It came out quickly but without any rush, which is impressive considering how busy Nome is.  My only advice would be that you should be comfortable with smaller seats, and absolutely making a reservation. I have never been here and been able to get anything but a bar without a reservation. Even that was a wait."}
{"text":"Went with some friends for buck a shuck on a Tuesday night.  Oysters were delicious.  We had the cod which was very flavourful.  The beef ribs were also good - seasoning was good and not a lot of fat like when you get it at all you can eat sushi.  We also ordered the double salmon sushi - didn't really like that. Wouldn't order again. Definitely not all it was hyped up to be."}
{"text":"They changed my $22 to $32 on my Visa Payment (I was covering extra tip on my credit card, had a larger bill with friends that we paid with cash).   I just checked my statement and they decided to take $10 extra dollars from me, and I did not take the receipt with me at the time. Disappointed in the staff. Lesson learned on always taking the receipt you signed."}
{"text":"Came here for the $1 oyster special on a weekday! They were really good and fresh, the sauces they gave us went so well with them! We also tried the monk fish tacos and the short ribs. The tacos were great- giant pieces of fish with a really unique sauce (with kiwi!) and some salad. It was one of the best tacos I've had! The short ribs were good but the tacos and oyster definitely stood out.  I like the vibe and space of this restaurant, but the space is kinda small if you sit on a single table. Overall, very solid izakaya with great food!"}
{"text":"Went for the oyster night and it was ok. The service is somehow slow - depends on how lucky you are... some of the waitresses really don't care. Sushi is better than average."}
{"text":"Nomé is one of my favourite izakayas. I've been numerous times and it never fails to disappoint. Their buck a shuck Tuesdays and Wednesdays are unbeatable, thus very popular, so definitely make a reservation through OpenTable a couple days in advance.   We had a reservation for 5:15pm today for 2 and we were seated promptly upon arriving. They told me about the 2 hour seating limit, which was fine. I usually get the Fanny Bay oysters - they're my absolute favourite. They go for $10 for 8. However, they were sold out today. My server recommended that we tried the Lucky oysters, which were a seasonal special. They were delicious and basically tasted like the Fanny Bays, except a little sweeter. A great recommendation, and they were $1 each, which was cheaper than the Fanny bays. Unfortunately, they're only a seasonal oyster and the server said they may be losing them soon.   The Japaburgers are another one of my favourite things on their menu. I was so excited to eat them that I forgot to take a picture. They're mini sliders that have the perfect combination of tastes in each bite. The patty is a little sweet and tastes kind of like bulgogi, and it's topped with lettuce, tomatoes, onions, and some sort of garlicky sauce. I've never had a burger like it and everyone I've recommended it to has always been blown away.   I decided to try something new on this visit, so we ordered the aburi salmon donburi, and it has become another one of my favourites here. The portion was pretty big considering it was only $12.80. It had an abundance of salmon, a poached egg yolk, and a bunch of greens mixed with an aburi sauce on top of a bed of sushi rice. You mix it all up before eating it, and again, it was another perfect combination of flavours.   Nomé has never failed to impress me in the countless times I've visited and I will continue to come back and recommend this place to all my friends."}
{"text":"Forget sushi.  Forget teriyaki. Forget ramen.    Remember the new age of Modern Japanese cuisine.  This is what's happening in Tokyo.  Get a glimpse of it here.  The Kushi oysters are fat and plump.  The shrimp and scallop with butter garlic (this ain't the Keg).  The pork belly - not what you would expect but a welcome change."}
{"text":"Our first time at this restaurant, a pleasant surprise.  Busy even on Thursday night, if you have a large group be sure to call ahead for reservation.  Positive: Excellent service, waitress are very tentative. All hands on deck at all times.  Price point:  Dozen Kusshi fresh oysters $34 Lobster sushi roll $18 15 pc sashimi $21 Seared salmon $9.50 Grilled shrimp and scallops $8.8  All ingredients freshly prepared, great taste, Dishes are very presentable.   Give it a try if you are in the area.  Small place with limited seating- call ahead to make reservations."}
{"text":"I've came here for the $1 oysters on Tuesday and Wednesday and its great. Keep in mind, reservations is a must because its so hard to get a table on those days. I really enjoy their Japa Burgers, Sashimi Salad and Beef Ribs. Its a really cool place to go with friends because you'll have a lot of fun. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Reservation required on a Thursday evening in the dead of winter? Really? haha at least that's what I was asked when I entered and saw half the tables empty. However they did fill up as the night progressed.  The environment got quite loud, not by music or tv playing in the background, but by other patrons of the restaurant. I felt like it was a shouting match at some point.  Food was good, but not mind blowing. If I had to compare it to another Izakaya, I defiantly enjoyed Guu's environment & food much better."}
{"text":"My Disclaimer right away is I don't eat seafood (hold for gasp and bugged out eyeballs). That's right, you read that correctly- this yelper doesn't eat seafood!   I came here for a friend's surprise birthday dinner. It was a cute place, the decor was very in tune with the restaurant. I was a little anxious because they are known for sashimi apparently and trust me I was dreading looking at the menu. However, don't knock a place until you try it rings true in this case.  I ordered the Japa burger and it was really delicious! I mean, I would come here again just to order it. They have some seasoning on them and sauce that is just to die for. Deep down, I wanted to order them again after i devoured the three sliders but I had to talk myself out of it.   Highly recommend this place for anybody who loves Japanese cuisine and want's some yummy sliders"}
{"text":"Excellent place for some Japanese food and/or oysters. Place is nicely renovated with excellent service. The food was well-prepared but my favourite was the Donburi on the separate menu, definitely worth a try. Their oysters are also quite decent but it would be best to come on Tuesdays where they have their oyster specials.   Overall, a nice place for some friends to chill and relax and enjoy some delicious food while devouring that bottle of wine."}
{"text":"I got the Japa burgers which were 3 slider burgers for about $8. They were very tasty and the combination of tender and crispy works well. It was flavorful and not too salty. I tried the  sashimi app.. It was over priced for 9 small pieces of sashimi for $10. The house warm sake was decently priced and worth visiting for. A friend had the risotto which was very buttery and satisfying to eat. That is if you like your risotto creamy and buttery.   The service in general was on par. Except for the black lipstick wearing hostess who gave dirty looks when I told her my reservation might be smaller than initially asked for. The restaurant never had a wait line and when realized I told a server to give up one of my reserved tables for any waiting customers.  After that the hostess on 3 separate occasions would give \"dirty looks\" to my table. It was childish and unprofessional. It is not our fault for the storm to prevent people from making the reservation.  For each obvious dirty look from the hostess the reviews loses a star. The food was good as well as the atmosphere but I will not be coming back because of that hostess' attitude and professionalism."}
{"text":"My friend and I was feeling peckish after a night workout in Vaughan. This was one of the Japanese restaurant that remains open late into 2am and boy were we glad we drove 30 minutes to get here.   First of all, street parking is free after 9 or 10pm when we got there, it's a bonus. It looked unassuming from the outside but when we went in it was unbelievable crowded at 11pm on a weeknight.  We couldn't get a table and had to sit at the bar.   The menu was Japanese fusion izakaya with offering from Japanese, Korean and western cuisine. The decor was modern and upbeat with dim lighting.  We ordered the Nagasaki champion. It was a soup with undescribable intense flavour. They didn't skimp on the ingredients either. In the end we were so full but there was still half of the wok left. We didn't want to waste any drop and asked for it to go, which the waiter happily obliged. He carefully double bagged the soup, which was different than most restaurants where they would place soup in a container with lid. I found the double bag method very considerate as you are not worrying about spillage while driving.   My friend and I made a pact that we'd come back every week after our workout to try every item on the menu"}
{"text":"Came here many times a while ago because of friends preferring to meet here when coming back to visit Toronto. One of the better izakayas in town.   For people that love oysters, they have cheap deals Tues/Weds.  Recommendations: Takoyaki, Ebi-Mayo, Japa Burgers, Creamy Mentai Potato (MUST!), Habanero Chicken, Grilled Squid, and Bulgogi Tacos   Can skip: Lobster Fantasy roll. For $18, it isnt worth it. Not much lobster that I can taste."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed my dinner tonight. Went with my friend for a last minute dinner. We were seated immediately on a third night around 9:30pm. We order half a dozen of Kushi oysters that cost $16 and tasted decent. We also ordered salmon double sushi roll which was a lot of food for a roll. Very generous portion for $14 and we ordered jara burger slider comes in 3 mini sliders $9.50 I think around. The food was good and would rate the quality 3.5 starts but I'm giving an extra star because they gave me a free birthday cake cause my friend tried to surprise me with cake while I went to bathroom. The cake also came with a sparkler! Which surprised me! Also they gave my friend free refills on the ice tea so +++"}
{"text":"Most everything here is amazing! Love the burgers and spare ribs. The sushi is a thing of art. And you gotta love that they have Cheesecake Factory cheesecake for dessert. The sangria is also a big hit! Only had a few misses like the baked clams and sashimi salad, but everything else makes up for it. This place will be a new regular for date night."}
{"text":"I came here for an alternative to thanksgiving. For a weekend, it was pretty quiet but at the same time, it was a very cozy place.  The atmosphere has the feel of a restaurant but the playfulness of a bar. It makes for a good relaxing environment and I'm sure that if I was here during a game, it would be a little more livened up. Either way, I was very comfy here. Considering that this is a tapas bar, don't think that the even though the portions look small, you need to order a lot. The portions are very filling. If you like a dish, you may not be able to grab sections cause you've tried a bunch of others indefinitely. I thought a lot of these dishes weren't going to fill me up but I was wrong. Pace yourself Something to help you pace is that they serve you tea. It warmed me up and it was good to have. Drinking water, you'll fill yourself up with it because the servers are really good at refilling it. Tea will relax you plus, their green tea is amazing so why not?  Try: Yam fries - sweet potatoes fries with a house dressing kick. They're good to start off with it you're still unsure on what to try. The dressing has a little spicy kick to it but paired with that tea, it doesn't overpower your palette. Lobster fantasy - I have nothing but good things to say for this. Deep fried lobster tail with cucumber and avocado topped with lobster salad. Pardon the pun but this was a fantasy for my mouth. I wanted seconds but I'm pretty sure I was getting full already. You cannot come here and not try this. Apple salmon roll - salmon sashimi with apple mayo dressing. The problem with this was that it came right after the lobster fantasy. It was a good dish but it couldn't live up to the hype my taste buds were having already. It had a sweet taste to it and the apple mayo emphasized it. If you are going to order this, order it before the lobster fantasy so you can appreciate it more. I wish I had done that. Buttered scallops and shrimps - baked scallop and shrimp in garlic butter. As a shellfish fan, I gobbled this down like I've never eaten food before. The butter is not overwhelming on the plate so you can taste and enjoy the scallops and the shrimps. It was a softer touch to the food but that was because they weren't grilled and it works! Huge contrast with the sushi because of the deep fried portion. Loved it!  The dishes are rather creative which adds to the feel of the place. I really enjoyed being here. It was a quaint little location and it hid in the bustle of the street but it's a gem. A diamond in the rough. I felt pretty at home here.  I would definitely want to come back, bring friends, drink some sake, watch a game. I think the next on my list would be to try the oysters and the java burgers."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a quiet izakaya experience, try the upper floor of Nome, it's much calmer than the atmosphere on the main floor.   The food here is fantastic, some of my favourites are the japa burger (the patty is actually slices of marinated beef that tasted like Korean BBQ), the sashimi donburi (essentially their sashimi salad with rice), and baked oysters. The unagi risotto was a little odd, the texture isn't like traditional rice and is almost mushy but it tasted alright.   I didn't try their drinks, but they had an interesting selection. Definitely consult your server about choices!"}
{"text":"Came here on Tuesday for their $1 oyster special. The oysters were very fresh and came with a variety of sauces that you can use. I really enjoyed these. They also have a variety of dishes so my boyfriend and I shared three other orders: the butter scallop and shrimp, the salmon donburi, and the lobster fantasy role. The salmon donburi was extremely filling and had great flavour. For $10, it was definitely the most worth it. Lobster fantasy was (of course) a bit pricier but was still very tasty. I would say the most disappointing is the scallop and shrimp as it was just regular pan fried scallop and shrimp with a bit of butter (wasn't really worth the $8 for 3 of each). Overall, it was a great meal and a great way to get quality oysters at a steal."}
{"text":"Finally tried Nome but was disappointed with quite a bit of everything.  Service was ok, maybe because they were getting really busy but I felt like the staff could have been a tad bit friendlier.  Food was ok at most for the price that we were paying. They didn't have any baked oysters which was what I really wanted to try, so that was a bummer. We ordered approx 7 dishes. They did come out at a good time I.e. Wait time wasn't too bad.  Apple salmon roll - really just tasted like your typical California roll with a little piece of salmon and slight sweetness from the apples, but to be honest, I didn't even realize there's apple flavour.  Tuna tango sashimi - small slices of torched tuna. Presentation was beautiful but that was really it. Tuna was fishy imo and didn't taste as fresh as it can.  Short ribs - delicious! Soft but my friends thought it was a tad sweet  Pork belly - all it was was a piece of fried fatty meat... didn't really taste like much  We had a few other dishes but nothing really stood out. Overall a disappointing experience. Not sure if I will come back in a long time."}
{"text":"This is my third time coming to this place. and i have to say that unfortunately. it has gone downhill since. I used to actually like this location because of the vibe the staff, and some of the food was pretty tasty. in the past it was worth a 4 star. now the 2 star is because a lot of it has fallen quickly.    when we first arrived at the restaurant our friend had gotten a seat, and we saw that there were plenty of empty seats around the side booth and since we have yet to order or use anything we asked the hostess if we could switch to the other seats. This is when the hostess rolled her eyes and gave us the biggest attitude, told us \"these tables are all requested\" i asked are they reserved? she said no they are requested. i said okay well i'm requesting one now too. she slammed the menus on the new tables rolled her eyes again and just stormed off.   i have no idea how this type of attitude is acceptable, especially at an izakaya where friendly and open bar atmosphere is why people come.   We had gotten to the table and the waitress herself was friendly, and this is the only reason this hasn't dropped to a 1 star. becuase the food certainly decreased in quality.   we ordered the japa burgers, mentai crispy potato, double salmon roll, and the crispy tuna on chip.   The first thing was mentai cripsy potato used to be the best thing on their menu. that has fallen downhill a lot. as the sauce and the spices aren't what they used to be and is bland at best.   the double salmon roll, just wasn't a good combination for a roll, especially given that they used smoked salmon in a restaurant that actually serves sashimi.   the cripsy tuna on chip, was pretty flavourless as well. all the previous dressings are gone, and literally it is tuna a a tortilla chip.   the final thing the Japa burgers was only thing that seemed to still be okay, as the taste hasn't changed much.   in the middle of our dinner after ordering and us telling the waitress we wanted to keep one menu to keep ordering, the hostess would again drop by to lecture us about keeping menus we aren't going to immediately order again.   basically i'm only giving them 2 stars at this point was becuase the bar looks clean, and the actual waitress was okay. however the food itself has gone downhill, and the angry hostess has really eliminated all reasons to go.  i used to do major group events at this place. now not only am i not going here anymore, i'm going to recommend all people i know to avoid this place like the plague. as its not a good price deal. crappy service, and food is bland. there is little saving grace for it."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is very nice to have a few drink with friends. The service is very good and friendly. The food is very different and it's worth trying out all of it. We have at least 6-7 dish and tasted very good. At least it's not nacho and fries again. The music is exciting but a touch loud. They have actual DJ to play it. If you never been here you should give it a try."}
{"text":"I came here for the first time with a friend for a quick snack (pulled in by the sign for $1 oysters). The hostess was very friendly and seated us promptly with menus as soon as we entered. However, we weren't approached for at least 10 minutes resulting in my friend having to flag down a waitress after we decided what to order. Other than that, the service was pleasant and efficient though we didn't stay very long.   The oysters were pretty small but for $1 I guess you can't really complain. We also ordered the Shrimp Udon Salad which was pretty tasty with its wasabi dressing. The Creamy Potato Croquette came fresh out of the fryer and arrived super hot. It was delicious with its crunchy outer shell and creamy inside with corn niblets.  The decor is modern and the location is convenient.   I'll be coming back to try other things off the menu!"}
{"text":"Brought my friend here for oyster night and she ended up suffering severe bowel movements once we got back. I, on the other hand, was okay.   Had a good time for the most part, however, the food presentation is nicer than it actually tastes."}
{"text":"I love it here!!! Service is great. Food is always on point. I also love the music that they play here. Brings me back to the 90s. They even play the UFC fight here!! What a bonus."}
{"text":"This place is a modern gem a fusion styled restaurant with somewhat creative  asian cuisine amongst other selections.  sushi and oysters who could complain?.  the menu is dynamic tappas style great for a lax date enrionment while still being casually hip posh and conteporary.   great service very knowledgable staff willingness to listen and answer questions and friendly staff.  the reason why a 4.5 /was because the prices can really add up and you can actually end up spending a lot of money for dinner ie $40/per person to get \"full\" tappas style."}
{"text":"Came by with the girls today. Nomé is the best place to go in the area for food or drinks.   Tuesday, Wednesday oyster nights are popping. Make sure to book reservations ahead of time to avoid disappointment.   They've recently installed a naturalized water that kills bacteria with an ultraviolet light and boy does it taste good! Pay the extra couple dollars for it.   Food is great, service is great. Can't complain.   My favourites are the lobster fantasy roll, sashimi salad, sliders and the new addition on their featured menu \"smoked scallop roll\" is really tasty.   The servers are hot. I love all of them even the owner Pat, which is super good looking as well Rachel is awesome and she's super attentive   Come here now if you haven't already  New location coming up soon!"}
{"text":"I came here on their oyster night.  They have a 2-hour sitting limit on oyster nights, but I think 2 hours were sufficient to enjoy the dinner.  The oysters were fresh.  I also got the takoyaki, tiger shrimps, mini burgers, tuna salad and the grilled ox tongue.  I like the mini burger.  The patty was tender and juicy, the sauce was a little bit sweet.  It was a nice combination.  The tiger shrimps were not bad.  It's deep fried with a thin coat of sauce that is similar to thousand island salad dressing.  Takoyaki was crispy.  I don't recommend the grilled of tongue coz it was a bit dry.  Overall, it was a great dining experience."}
{"text":"Tuesday & Wednesday $1 Oyster specials or $12 for 10 Fanny Bay (it's the larger ones) we had A LOT, there was no limit on it and they were happy to give us as much as we wanted.  make reservations (they seems to have a lot of empty tables that are empty) and doesn't use the available space very well.  besides the oysters, the japa burgers are nice and juicy and great flavor, I could probably eat a dozen of these tiny things. The spicy short ribs were really spicy, and there was about 3 pieces for $10+ (overpriced much?)  It's a good place for some drinks with friends, share a few dishes and have oysters."}
{"text":"WHy I love this place -- because its close to work and it has 2 days of Happy hour $1 oysters WOO!!!   However, since everyone knows this -- it often takes awhile to get a table during those evenings. This place is just packed! don't come with a ton of people. Maybe if you are a table of 2, you can get a table more easily if you choose to sit at the bar. Even still, this place is a \"bar' so you should expect it to be quite loud.   Aside from the oysters, I like to order their japaburgers, eel risotto... but mostly I would just order drinks and eat oysters and then drink some more ."}
{"text":"My absolute favourite restaurant in the GTA.   They just recently opened up the second floor/patio section which is great because back then wait time for a table was ridiculous. But you should still make a reservation if you were to come on a Tuesday or Wednesday ($1 oyster days)  My top 3 recommendations if it's your first time here are the sweet potato fries, California Style Donburi, and Japaburgers. These are the things that constantly bring my friends and I back!"}
{"text":"A quieter version of Guu~ but they'll need to step up their game, quality-wise, to try to beat them. Baked oysters weren't as good their's. Everything else was not bad. Not AMAZING, just not bad."}
{"text":"A really nice atmosphere! We were greeted as soon as we walked in, and being a Saturday night (5:00p), they already had solid reservations booked so we had to be done before 7....no problem! But a tip: reserve your seat for the weekend!  Had the sashimi, baked oysters and my fiancé had the salmon sushi rolls. Everything came out at a nice pace, and tasted great! I was surprised that we filled up, especially him (he's a food machine), but it was a perfect amount.  We spent $60 (under our budget)and walked away satisfied."}
{"text":"Been here a handful of times and have always had a great meal. $1 malpec oysters on Tues/Wed, bulgogi beef tacos, grilled marinated squid, japa burgers, and ebi-mayo (tiger shrimp with mayo and sweet chili thai dressing) were all fantastic! Place is always super busy, so make sure to make a reservation at least the day before coming!"}
{"text":"We made reservations for 6pm on a Friday, but it wasn't necessary because the place didn't start to crowd up yet. Nome Izkaya is located in an extremely busy but beautiful neighbourhood with tons of shops and restaurants all around.   First Impressions: With such an oriental name, I expected walking into the store with an oriental menu and oriental vybe. JOKES - this place is pretty Westernized. You know when a place isn't oriental by: 1) looking at the menu (there's no Asian words in it),  2) the servers (only one Asian server that day), and  3) the bathrooms (nicely decorated with Westernized Asian Thai mixture).  In no intention of being stereotypical, (although oriental places sometimes have no Asian words in it and maybe their bathrooms are decorated similarly), it's pretty rare.   Seating: I don't know how skinny they expect their guests to be, but I felt like I was on the verge of knocking over the drink of the table beside me with my gluteus maximus. You're so close to the other table that you can hear the conversation they're having. For instance, the couple in the table next to mine just happened to be on their first Tinder date. Sorry guys, I really didn't want to eavesdrop, but I couldn't try to talk over you because I was too busy stuffing myself with this delicious food.  Food: Five stars. Good quality, loved the East Coast oysters and the huge selection of sauces. I didn't taste any sand in the oysters, meaning they were well washed and shucked! The unagi rice was in a small portion, but the rice was cooked well, well as in it wasn't just plain rice. The Jappa burgers. So small and cute, but beware of these devils, they fill you up more than you expect, or at least, they filled my petite stomach up real fast. Last but no least, I love the way they serve the rolls, the long plates are amazing because I no longer have to reach all the way across the table to grab my food."}
{"text":"This Japanese tapas place is awesome , good portions , not overpriced ,Their Japa burger was life changingly good , and the dollar an oyster deal is also awesome , busy on weekdays so reservations is a must !!!"}
{"text":"Had the Mac and cheese for the first time at this place and it was a m a z i n g. When I had the Mac and cheese there was a lot of seafood and bacon. Super content with it and would definitely go back for more! I was so close on ordering seconds but I had to control myself so I didn't. Their japa burger is definitely a great appetizer to share with your friends!   However, I wouldn't recommend the maguro and avocado tartare. The portion is very small and expensive. It didn't taste very special either."}
{"text":"On Tuesdays & Wednesdays - $1 buck-a-shuck oysters all night! Need I say more? Such a cute, cozy restaurant that satisfies all cravings! My girls & I are in love with the Japa-Burgers ($9.80), Mac & Cheese ($10.80), spicy short ribs ($10.80) & the chicken wings ($9.50/lb)."}
{"text":"I've been here multiple times now, it's great for group get togethers as they are super accommodating with splitting the bill and there's enough space upstairs and downstairs for large parties. As with other izakayas, it's small tapas so it tends to get pricey depending on what you order. I usually go for the buck a shuck on Tuesday's and Wednesday's since it's such a good deal, definitely recommended to make a reservation. Recently the last few times I went I was not impressed with the quality of the oysters. There were so many pieces of shell inside and they tasted a little off.  Service is great otherwise."}
{"text":"Wow I was surprisingly disappointed with this place. Based on all the reviews and people talking bout it I was excited to try it since I love Guu. To my surprise it was nothing compared to Guu. We went early so there was no wait but I felt rushed out as they needed us to give our table back to them at 730. But we were no where close to 730 and they already didn't serve us and wanted us to leave. My gf order an extra beer and they didn't even bring it to her. We order some risotto rice in a hot pot, sent it back as the rice was all mush and was nothing like risotto. Order a few rolls and some shashimi. The grade of sushi is good but  the food wasn't that great. Maybe i didn't order the right things but I wasn't impressed with the place. I left hungry! I guess I would try it again if I went with someone who knew what to order but it wouldn't be my place to go for izikaya in the North York area."}
{"text":"This is a very popular place to get cheap oysters (a buck a shuck) on Wednesdays. When we come here we always order lots of foods to share and to try. The food highlights for me are the baked oysters, sashimi salad, the tiger shrimp/butter scallops, fresh oysters and takoyaki. Drink highlights would be the soju yogurt mix drink. I would definitely recommend coming here with friends, place can get really packed and (club like) later in the evening as well. If you are looking for a quiet romantic dinner this may not be the place. It is also quite pricey and the portions can vary from medium to small portions. Don't expect large portions."}
{"text":"All I can say is Sake Bombs!!! They are addictive as well as the oysters. The place is for the young hip crowd in North York where you can enjoy some food, drinks and good company. The wait staff are very attentive and are quick to serve you on whatever you need.  Every night of the week, there are different specials. Many friends come for the oyster special on Tuesdays and Wednesdays. The food is amazing too from the Mentai potato chips to the fresh sashimi. They were able to accommodate a group of up to 32 people but make sure you call in advance to reserve. You may be disappointed that a table is not available as this place fills up.  Although the venue is all indoors, I found out that the patio will be opening in July which will be a good surprise given the summer weather is arriving soon. There is parking along the side streets as well as the back and along Yonge. I definitely will come back and make sure to ask the staff for recommendations on the menu."}
{"text":"Hubby and I and some friends came here for an early dinner on a Saturday night and were able to be seated right away. I liked the Japanese themed wall art, particularly the sumo wrestler artwork.   We enjoyed everything we ordered, including unagi risotto, marinated short ribs, marinated black cod, and takoyaki. The takoyaki in particular was probably some of the best I've ever had (including in Japan). What I liked about it was that the inside was soft but not liquid batter inside, yet had a firm exterior and a large piece of octopus inside. The ebi  with shrimp crackers was also a personal favourite.  The service was reasonably attentive. Prices were a little pricey but not unreasonable. Although our group of 4 were seated right away for an early dinner I would definitely suggest reservations especially if you're a bigger group."}
{"text":"TL;DR: I love the $1 oysters on Tues/Wednesday. Other foods are alright, and make sure to reserve a spot cause it gets pretty packed. Also, the place is pretty loud and you'll have to talk quite loudly to be heard.   Nome is a favorite of mine for their $1 oysters on Tuesdays and Wednesdays. The place gets pretty packed on these days, so expect for some wait if you're going at prime time or for a late night snack. The rest of their menu items aren't bad, and I would personally suggest to get the Tornado potatoe, and Japa Burgers. Even if you go on their $1 specials night, don't expect to get too full without ordering any other sides -- I, for one, usually only end up eating 14 oysters until I stop. Overall, it's a place with some good vibes and pretty good food.    1. Food (4/5)  All their food is cooked on order, and but does not take especially long. Their fish and oysters are always fresh, and you can see the chefs opening the oysters if you grab a bar seat. Their other menu items are pretty standard in quality, but I do recommend the Japa burgers and the tornado potatoe; both of which are one of my fav foods to get from Nome.   2. Service (3.5/5)  Their service isn't bad or anything, but it may take some effort to get the attention of the staff. I have ran into cases where it took them around 8 - 10min before I got my cheque, but to be fair, they were extremely busy at the time. No major concerns about their service, and it's pretty much what you would expect from anywhere. Food wait time isn't especially long either. Expect to wait around 15 - 20min on deal days.  3. Wait Time / Reservations (3/5)  If you plan on going for one of the deal nights, I recommend that you call in advance (usually the day of works) and just reserve a seat. If you don't, you might be expected to wait around 30min for a seat, and they might not be very good ones. So... just book!  ------------  Overall (3.5 - 4/5)"}
{"text":"This was my first Izakaya experience, and boy, did it fuel my hunger!   Came here last week on a whim with two of my friends, and we had such a great time!   It wasn;t too packed, but it was a thursday night around 6, so expected. But still alot of customers.   The decor was awesome, the menus were decorated with those ed hardy style japanese tattoo drawings. See pix I've added. So cool.  Anyways, we had:  1. The Shrimp Udon Salad w/ Wasabi dressing. - HONESTLY SO GOOD. Im not really a salad person, but I really enjoyed it. The dressing was sooo yum. I want that on everything from now on.  2. The Samurai Salad - it was exactly like the previous, minus the udon and extra crunchy stuffs.  3. The Pork Belly - YUM. Deep fried, crispy on the outside, and melty fatty yummness on the inside! 6 pieces, not a lot. But you can't eat more than three without feeling like a glutton.  4. The Galbi - Standard Galbi fare. Yumness and yumness.  5. The Butter Scallop and Shrimp - served in the cutest sea shell! SUPER DELICIOUS. My friend literallly drank the butter after. It was that good.  6. THe Sweet Potato Fries - can't go wrong there.  7. Complimentary oyster shots for the table! So yum! The seafood sauce on it was delicious.   Overall - IT WAS AWESOME. The service was great, fast and prompt. The location is super nice on the inside.   The drink menu looked fun and creative. Will try next time."}
{"text":"the food was alright and not as loud as typical izakayas but I often challenge whether izakayas are worth it.   food: 3/5, got bunch of stuff and very typical. the spicy short ribs were too spicy though. the sashimi salad was probably the best  service: 2/5, not much attention. all servers were girls with skimpy clothing and just brought food and no service like eater refills or checking in on food etc.  ambience: 3/5. not too loud and good seating   price: 2/5. about $20+ per person for three people sharing 5dishes"}
{"text":"This place is AWESOME. Everything tastes SO GOOD. Waiters are attentive, food is delicious... We had grilled oysters, burger, Korean beef and more. Drinks and cocktails are great also. Nice atmosphere and it's a good place to sit and chit chat with your friends:).. Definitely recommend everyone to try it out!!"}
{"text":"OMG... AGAIN.. CAN I DIE NOW?!?!?!?!? Once upon a time, I loved nome. Now, I'm asking for it's hand in marriage. There was a period of time where I came here just about every day... then my bank account started it's yapping, and I had to stop for a bit. Recently been coming back again, because I can't stay away from this beauty. Nome is a super chill place to catch up with friends, do some sake bombs, play roulette with their extensive list of shots ($3 on Saturday, so get ready to throw up...) or just generally have a good time. I love the malpaque oysters because they go down so easily and they're a great treat, especially when they're a buck-a-shuck. Although I've tried 95% of the menu, the dishes and drinks I really recommend are: Chicken karaage (omg the wasabi mayo dipping sauce is AMAZING. I wish I was born in this) Shrimp udon salad (So unique and delicious!! Cold udon with a great wasabi flavour. Also the prawns used are HUGE)  Oysters (Love the east coast ones, the west coasts are a bit fishy for my taste) The rising sun (delicious mango cocktail for a quick paradise getaway) Sake bombs (Fun to do with a bunch of friends) Japa burgers (yummy little sliders that do a good job at sliding into your mouth faster than you can imagine)  Takoyaki (best in GTA, in my opinion)   The owner, Patrick, is also SUPER nice and accommodating. We came here for a UYE recently  (1st I've ever hosted!!) and he was super kind and made sure we were all happy. Also, shoutout to my servers Sylvia, Keya + Wendy! I get these babes all the time, and I find them the best at Nome. Super sweet, quick and obviously the best. The other servers are also really nice and efficient! Once my friend had too much to drink on her bday and the male waiter brought a bottle of water and a bag downstairs for her. Totally sweet and I've never seen another restaurant do that without charging you for the water. They also accomdate and take care of my friend a lot (he's ratchet)   I love love love you guys!  Especially because they're opening a new patio! Dibs on first choice seating. ;) I don't care what anyone says, THIS is the best izakaya in toronto. And if you don't agree, good- leave, because you don't deserve it."}
{"text":"We had 6 people and multiple dishes and every single one was excellent. Highly recommend the Japa Burgers and the Tuna Coins. The Honey Bread is to die for."}
{"text":"Was near Sheppard-Yonge and thought I'd try some of the Korean food in the area which I'd heard was good. Decided to rely on Yelp, and found that none of the Korean restaurants in the area had spectacular reviews. Instead, I found Nomé, a Japanese Izakaya, which did. I walked in asking for a spot at the bar, as it was busy. Was told it would be approx. a 30 min wait, and that I'd be texted when my spot was available. No problem. I walked out, got settled at a pub to get a drink. Just as the waitress was about to come and take my order, I was texted saying I was up next at Nomé. I walked back, and was told I got a table. That 30 min wait ended up being less than 3.  Ambience is nice. Young crowd with a Japanese-modern interior (lots of wood, warm hanging lightbulbs, Japanese labeled Sake as decor). The hostess was nice and made me feel welcome despite it being just me. I was told it was buck-a-shuck Wednesday. I love oysters more than most things in the world, so I promptly ordered half a dozen as well as the grilled marinated squid, the grilled marinated black cod, and a pint of Sapporo. Prices are reasonable.  The squid came first. Delicious. Perfectly chewy with distinctly Japanese seasoning (predominantly savoury with a hint of sticky sweetness). It was beautifully presented - a sort of tower of pan-fried squid. Next was the black cod. This was definitely my favourite dish. Smoky, sweet, sauce reminiscent of the best Korean short-rib marinade (not sure if the sauce is also shared by the Japanese, but I've only tasted it in Korean food). Usually I skip fish skin, but the way the cod was presented with the skin on top made it clear I wasn't meant to leave it unattended to. I'm not sure how, but the skin literally glistened with a citrusy sauce. Not shined, straight-up glistened. The meat itself was so flaky and rich, with that buttery taste cod can have when made properly.  As it turned out, the waitress who took my order had forgotten to include my oysters. No problem - another waiter corrected this and brought them out promptly. Buck-a-shuck is a funny thing. On the one hand, it seems like it should always be worth it if you love oysters. On the other, if the oysters aren't amazing, even the low price-tag can't really make them good. I'd say they're okay here. More meaty than most buck-a-shuck specials, but the flavour is a little off. Not terrible, but not good. This explains the wide variety of sauces they bring for the oysters. My favourite was the white wine, although I tend to prefer my oysters with just drop  of lemon. The pesto was a cool idea, but too overpowering. You can tell the oysters they serve that aren't a dollar a piece are probably better.  Finally, I got the tiger shrimps. They're nice, but I'd recommend them almost as a desert. They come fried, with a sweet sauce that's a little too sweet for me.   Overall, great experience. Would come again."}
{"text":"This is definitely one of my favourite restaurants to go to!! Everything here is so so so good. Whenever I come here I usually make a reservation before hand so I don't have to wait.  I came here on a Wednesday night with a reservation at 10 and they sat me immediately with a full house. The waitress did her part in taking our order but I'm not too sure why it took so long for our drinks and food to come out. I've never experienced this on my other visits here. They must've been really backed up in the kitchen because it took about 40 minutes for our food and drinks to come out. We got the salmon donburi, oysters, japa burgers, honey bread and the beef sashimi."}
{"text":"The service is nice and the food was pretty good. The price is okay but great to split with friends. Definitely recommend to reserve a table to ensure that you have a table."}
{"text":"Located right at the Sheppard-Yonge station, it is a convenient place to hang out with friends if you are not familiar with the area and want to dine at a restaurant with many dishes to choose from and be a part of an ambiance that resembles a pub for young adolescents.   Unagi Risotto ($8.80) Creamy risotto, topped with bbq eel - Small clay bowl, even smaller portions. I swear there were only 4 bites in here :( I'm sad because it was buttery and decadent...while it lasted.  Buttered Shrimp & Scallop ($8.80) Baked scallop and shrimp, simmered in garlic butter - Slightly bigger than the Unagi Risotto. It's exactly how you'd expect it to be, plated beautifully over a shell with crispy noodles cascading over the edges.  Cocktail Soju Half Litre ($14.95) 1 Litre ($22.95) Served in a tall sleek flask; you can barely taste the alcohol. Get the yogurt flavour! I'd come back here just for it.  I've been here a few times last year, primarily for their dollar oysters, since one of my friends really liked this place. They had a good variety listed on their menu with specifications on the types and location.  Oysters: Keep in mind only 2 kinds were $1 on the Tuesday/Wednesday special whilst the rest were $1.50 or more. Either way, the oysters are consistently fresh and delicious. The malpeques oysters I've had are smaller in size in comparison to Spring Roll's & Pearl Diver's $1 oysters, however. This place has the biggest assortment of sauces that they provide out of all the other oyster bars I've been to, which include lemon, horse radish, cocktail sauce, vinegar, spicy, soy sauce etc. On these nights it's best to book a reservation ahead of time as it can be crowded.  TL;DR  If you care more about the restaurant experience (the ambiance & hot waitresses) and food quality (unique recipe combinations & fancy plating for instagram pics) over spending a lot of money and not being full, then this is the perfect place for you!"}
{"text":"The food and beverage here is outstanding! I love all the dishes my friends and I ordered and the Singapore soho sling is out of this world! It's a really busy place on Tuesday and Wednesdays because of the oyster deal, so we decided to come on a Thursday (still just as busy)! We tried the pork belly, marinated Korean short ribs, double salmon roll and  salmon sashimi. The pork belly was crispy and melt in your mouth, the short ribs were tender and flavourful without being too saucy, and the sashimi was very fresh. We screwed up by not reading the menu because the double salmon roll is all cooked salmon, (grilled salmon in the middle and smoked salmon wrapped on the outside). It's still tasty but probably wouldn't do it again because the salmon is cooked. The soho Singapore sling is an out of this world mojito!! Made with soho lychee vodka instead of rum and cucumbers instead of limes. It was so refreshing I could drink it all night long! Overall the food and drinks are great here and Thursday is even the $3 sake sangria deal day!  The only downfall with this restaurant is the seating is way too squishy. The gentleman going to the table next to ours accidentally knocked our water glasses onto my date when he was coming in. Totally not his fault because there was really no room to slide into the table next to us so hopefully they can restructure their seats to accommodate all individuals and not make it so hard to get seated."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place. Amazing food and really great atmosphere. I come here about once a month and am always very satisfied with my experience. Some of my favourites on the menu: fish tacos, japa burgers, donburi and the tiger shrimp. They have cool fusion drinks too. Friendly servers and food comes out quickly even when it's busy."}
{"text":"Great place, good food and very lively but might be too loud for some. The Oysters, tiger shrimp and Japa burgers were delicious!"}
{"text":"Had some 1 to 2 dollar oysters here the other night. Taste was amazing. They offer you different type of sauces with it, oysters are clean and great quality.  Service was good, we got served quick and accurate.  I would definitely recommend this place to others.  Only thing negative is the beer price. Even though the oysters were cheap, the price of a pitcher of beer definitely makes up the difference. I believe we paid up to $27 for 1 pitcher of Sapporo Japanese beer."}
{"text":"Ordered:  Japa Burgers, Shrimp Udon Salad, Red Sangria   No complaints about the burgers they were delicious, and the sangria was a great choice as well. The Shrimp Udon attracted a lot of fruit flies while we were eating... That was the end of that."}
{"text":"ALWAYS my go-to spot. Great for food. Great for drinks. This place never disappoints.   On Tuesday and Wednesday, they do $1 oysters! Some great items on the menu are the japa burgers, mac and cheese (and i'm not even a big fan of cheese, that's how yummy the mac and cheese is), shrimp udon salad, samurai crunch salad, baked oysters and the marinated black cod.   The staff here are really friendly and they're great. Atmosphere is live but not too loud where you can't hear your own conversation. Nothing to not like about this place!"}
{"text":"The food tastes okay and the ambience is cool. The menu is mainly raw oysters, rolls, and Japanese tapas. The portions are moderate with the tapas being tad bit on the  smaller side. The waitresses are friendly and helpful. Just okay if you're around the area and is craving fried Japanese bar food."}
{"text":"Parking in the back is plenty always packed 30-40 min waits. My favourite place for oysters. Food is solid. Sliders are kinda on the sweet side. Wasabi squids is the best."}
{"text":"Izakaya became very popular in the last 5 years in Toronto shortly after Guu hit off the city with a bang.  Since then, many other izakaya places popped up and I have to say Nome is probably up there when it comes to the best izakayas (Japanese tapas bar) in Toronto.  I came here a few times already so I already know what kind of environment this place is.  This place is a perfect model for izakaya, bar type restaurant with Japanese beer and small dishes and a TV to watch sports.  To top it off, this place offers fresh oysters and on Tuesday and Wednesday, they offer $1 per oyster special on selected oysters.  If you are an oyster lover, i highly recommend ordering their fresh oysters on Tuesday and Wednesday!  On regular nights, I highly recommend ordering the Shrimp Udon Salad (Salad with udon in a wasabi base dressing), Japa Burger (Sliders with in-house special sauce that makes it super delicious), Tuna tataki (Raw Tune with the sides seared) and to top it off, order an Asahi  Black (Rare beer!!) or a Sake Bomb!  Food are made well and servers are super nice just as the owner Patrick.  Shout out to our lovely and beautiful server of the night, Sylvia, for being so patient and always putting a smile when serving our table of 10+ LOUD people."}
{"text":"Had an excellent time here coming with my friend. It was just the two of us, and we didn't have any reservations during their $1 oyster night, so we expected to be waiting for a bit. It was extremely busy, but we got seated 10 minutes after at the bar.   The food came impressively quick and we were served well. The girl at the bar would ask us if we needed anything else, and was very sweet. On top of that, the food was DELICIOUS.   If you're planning on coming here with a bigger party, I would recommend reservations.   All in all a great experience and I can't wait to come back for more! 10/10"}
{"text":"This place will get five stars if all the servers are nice enough (attitude and forgot the order). The place is great place to eat a pretty big menu for izakaya in Toronto. And food is delicious. Live DJ could use some real mixing skills instead of auto play"}
{"text":"My wife and I had dinner here for our date night without the kids.  It was a Thursday so their Sake Sangrias were half priced.  We ordered one each of the red wine and white wine drinks and they were tasty in a dangerous way.  Good thing we didn't go for the half-price pitcher... ;)  This is a Japanese tapas style place like Guu - so dishes are smaller and you're meant to share a bunch of them.  I love these kind of places because you get to eat and try a greater variety of things.  For food, we ordered the sashimi salad, Japa burger, Tuna Tango, Baked Oysters, and Unagi Risotto.  The sashimi and tuna was fresh and had good sauces.  The Japa burger was tummy with their own ground beef and on the sweeter side.  I wasn't sure I'd like the Unagi risotto but it turned out pretty well.  We did not partake in their fresh oysters - which we will be back for on a Tuesday or Wednesday when it's $1/oyster.  Recommended!"}
{"text":"overhype place for IZakaya... I don't think I can go back.. especially seeing as the night goes on.. it gets busier, louder and rowdier...and transforming more into a bar lounge... and what's up with these waitresses dressing up like they work for hooters??!?!?!?    I think if you want similar food, there are better alternative out there.. and yes, unlike this place...anywhere else u go u won't get charged for something related to your Birthday...like said Guu for example (free of charge!)  Expect lots of overpriced deep fried.stuffs..."}

{"text":"A great place for delicious Izakaya shared plates. I visited on a Wednesday with a reservation booked. The sit time is a max of 2h, as the restaurant is small and busy. It was a fairly dark facility, but had comfortable chairs. There is parking immediately behind the building which is convenient.   The menu is extensive. We ordered everything from oysters, to sashimi, to scallops and shrimp, to donburi, to spicy sashimi tortilla bites, and so on. The dishes were delicious, well presented, and came out in a timely fashion.   The waiter brought us one 9 piece sashimi instead of a 15 as ordered, which was not corrected. A second order came out properly as a 15, but unfortunately they charged for two 15s anyway. Beyond that mistake, the experience was quite positive!"}
{"text":"Second rating is still a 5-star! This time, I came for the buck-a-shuck oysters on a Tuesday. We walked in without reservations and were seated right away (around 7pm) but were told we had the table for two hours, which was fine.   Japa burgers were still the highlight! Highly recommend."}
{"text":"I've been to Nomé a couple times for their half priced oysters, and they never disappoint! Go for the Fanny Bay oysters if you want your oysters to be thick and juicy . I also had the takoyaki and the buttered shrimp and scallop. The shrimp and scallop seemed like a really simple dish and it could've been more creative in that aspect. Their sangria is to dieee for. I will probably go back to try their other appetizers on the menu.  The service was alright, the hostess seemed unattentive, and my server as well. I understand it's a really busy place!"}
{"text":"Unagi risotto, which is Chef Recommended, is not risotto. It's a failed attempt at risotto and more like mush. It also came out 50 mins after all the other dishes.   Rest of the food was mediocre at best and service  is definitely not there.   There are better izakayas in the hood. Don't waste your time or money."}
{"text":"The Malpeque oysters from P.E.I were amazing. They were very nice, texture was nice and smooth but not slimy and they tasted amazing. Lemon juice is a must on each.   The Japa burgers (comes in 3) were absolutely amazing. The sauces blended together amazingly and the meat was extraordinarily juicy. A nice surprise was the crunchiness from the wontons leading to an explosion of both flavour and texture. I had to order another one because it was so good!  The unagi risotto was thick in texture and my boyfriend enjoyed it. The eel was a nice added touch with the sauce to this dish but I, for one, wasn't a big fan of it so -1 star for that.  The atmosphere was nice and dim-lit, a very good place for a date. I highly recommend coming here!!"}
{"text":"$1 oysters. That's all you need to know.  Certainly not the first to do it in Toronto though, Biff's Bistro on Front also does this - but everyday after 5pm. Good luck getting a table though as it's downtown. There's also a restaurant in Mississauga that does as well.  (BTW, for oysters connoisseurs; all of the restaurants that does the $1 oysters all serve Malpeque, straight out of PEI where they are farmed year round. Safe, fresh, cheap to \"manufacture\", averages $2-$3 each at most supermarkets. Though I'm sure restos get it for cheaper as they buy wholesale..)  At Nome, the eye candy are certainly fantastic as the oysters. The ladies working looks like they came straight from Moxies/Earls/Joey restaurants, matching \"uniforms\" too to boot!   A bro friend and I arrived on a early Wednesday evening for dinner. We were promptly seated by the cheery hostess/waitress at the front. The place was pretty busy for a weeknight, every table had an order or two of the $1 oysters that we were all here to enjoy.  There are TVs abound to catch your favourite sporting event, for tonight it was the Raptors versus the Trail Blazers. (We won btw, first time against them in 4 years!!!)   We ordered 2 dozen oysters at $1 each, baked oysters (kakimayo), kalbi ribs, burger sliders.   All your usual sauces for your raw oysters were there: cocktail, horseradish, mignonette, and I think the dark brown one was vinegar soy sauce the same kind you get at sushi restaurants. Tabasco sauce in the bottle on request as well.  Oh, did I forget to mention they also serve sashimi and sushi rolls?  Score! Not sure how fresh the sashimi is/was as we did not order it this time.   All our orders were great to taste, though we could have done without the baked oysters, it was watery, bland, undercooked. Guu does it a whole lot better and for the same price too! (Guu as an izakaya though exists in its own class.)    Kalbi ribs was fantastic, very tasty and tender. The sliders were also very good, at 3 small burgers per order. (Why only 3? All restaurants that serve sliders do this.)  Oysters came quick, compliments of their speedy shucker though I must feel bad for him/her who has to shuck oysters non-stop during their Tue-Wed specials night. Our other orders came promptly too. Service was OK, it was hard to flag down a waitress sometimes as it was a busy night with most tables filled.  There was a generous menu of sake and Japanese brewed beer, bit pricy but nevertheless, a big selection of both.    The place is definitely spacious, nice low lit ambience and you would have never guessed this gem existed in the Yonge/Sheppard area.  It's a great place to hang out over drinks and tapas food with a friend or friends to waste the night away, do some people watching (eye candy both working there and patrons abound) or take in the game or fight. I recall them advertising UFC nights when there is a big bout on the line.   I will definitely be back to try the other items on the menu.  Pro tip: park on the side streets, where it's free.  The paid parking lot directly behind is $1.50 for half hour."}
{"text":"It's wonderful. From the decor to the cuisine, just fantastic.  I would recommend skipping the blackened cod. Otherwise the Tapas were delicious.  We sampled a wide range of things.  THE BEST: the pork belly."}
{"text":"Eeek gross! I guess they haven't fixed themselves after their yellow food inspection score earlier this year.   We ordered 16 Fanny Bay Oysters and they were all super fishy smelling and not shucked properly. They were all still fully attached to the shell, had shell fragments in each oyster, and were squishy as hell. They all literally smelled like the fish section of a chinese grocery store. Disgusting. The waitress tried to tell us that that's usually how fishy they are, like we've never had oysters before. She didn't even bother to smell them herself.   The salmon aburi donburi was pretty good, takowasabi was pretty good. Oysters are no longer good. Bleh."}
{"text":"I'm a fan of their $1 Tuesday and Wednesday oyster special! I love the sauce selection.  Don't bother walking in without reservations.  Fave Potato chips + cheese dip is addictive and tasty even when cold"}
{"text":"Great service here. Came for $1 oysters on a Tuesday and made sure to make reservations (even 30 mins before arrival ). They filled up pretty quickly! Everything on the menu was good and incorporated different flavors and textures. Great place for group drinks or dinner dates. Best of all, they serve Cheesecake Factory cheesecakes."}
{"text":"First time visiting.  Not impressed at all! Party of three arrived at the restaurant around 9pm. Ordered about $70 worth of food and drinks. After staying about 2 hours, we were asked to leave in 15 min due to their reservation status.  Not even 5 min passed after we were told to finish our food within 15 min, the server came back to tell us their expected guest just arrived! (Are you telling us to evacuate immidetly??) Packed out our unfinished food, we were literally kicked out from the restaurant! First time EVER being kicked out from a restaurant in my whole entire life! POOR MANAGEMENT!! Never going back ever again!  Never will recommend  to anyone online and offline."}
{"text":"Food positing alert! I got sick after having dinner at this place and had to spend next day at the hospital. Will never come back for obvious reasons"}
{"text":"Nomé is my ultimate go to when I'm craving for oysters. On Tuesdays and Wednesday they offer $1 oysters! Make sure to make a reservation or you'll be waiting for a bit! I highly enjoy the atmosphere at nomé, music is good, food is amazing and the staff is very attentive.   I highly recommend the Japa burgers, their sushi rolls and of course $1 oysters!   Friday through to Sunday nomé can get pretty loud, so I do recommend asking for bar seats if you don't want to be yelling across the table."}
{"text":"The sushi's are very expensive. Mostly $20 for a roll which doesn't fill me and I am tiny. Had the double salmon roll which is grilled salmon on top, the roll does not have very good texture or taste, somehow tasted a bit spicy to me, it is one wierd sushi roll to me.   I feel bad for the female servers having to wear such skimpy clothing as if it's 30degrees in the summer, if I were one of them I would be super cold and may even get sick. Just my two cents.   People are still coming in at 11pm, 1130pm, and beyond. I'm surprised there are a lot of people here for food."}
{"text":"This is not an oyster bar it is a tapas fusion bar.  Sushi, sashimi and braised pork belly.  Good sized take as portions.  If you come to Toronto you have to try this place.  Zelena is fantastic"}
{"text":"I absolutely loved this place. Initially I was disappointed to only get a reservation at the bar but this place surpassed all my expectations. My partner and I shared the shrimp udon salad, bulgogi tacos, sliders, short ribs, and fried chicken. Everything was delicious! Highly recommend. Nice atmosphere with great service."}
{"text":"This is a really solid Izakaya which has unique Japanese-fusion drinks and foods. I'm not a fan of oysters but my friends love the specials they have here. They got great plates to share, but moderate portions so your bill might turn out more than the usual izakaya.  I recommend having a reservation and asking for the upstairs patio area. Or if you don't mind sitting at the bar there's usually no wait time."}
{"text":"Nome is a great place to go with friends. It's a bit loud and space is tight, but it's a great atmosphere. I came on a Wednesday for their oyster special, and it was packed!  Make sure to get a reservation or you will have to wait. We were also told there was a 2 hour limit when we arrived.  They have a pretty extensive menu, both for food and drinks. It is a Japanese tapas style restaurant, thus the portions are smaller and are meant for sharing. I also see some korean influences in the menu.  The oyster special were $1 for malpeque, $12 for 10 fanny bay, and $0.80 off other oysters. We ended up ordering the kusshi ones, which were creamy and fresh but the sizes varied a lot on our plate. Almost every table had a plate of oysters.   Wara yaki was absolutely delicious. It is slightly seared sashimi salmon, that is also smoked in house. There was a strong smoky flavour and the salmon was very fatty. It can get a little oily but with the salt and raw onion, it was perfect.   Takoyaki was average. It had a lot of octopus but I would've preferred a more crispy outer layer.   The beef sashimi is a korean dish that was served with pita chips. The sweet soya sauce made it very appetizing and a definite hit in my books. However, the texture may not be for everyone as it is also served with a raw egg yolk.   Lastly, we ordered the japa-burger, which is also a popular item. It was tasty but the rib-eye patty came out a bit dry.   Our server was attentive and very informative. I will definitely come back to Nome to try out the rest of their menu."}
{"text":"If you are looking for an authentic Japanese Izakaya place, this ain't it. The food is good, but it's Korean style. Eg the salad dressing has more sesame oil taste than Japanese style, ebi tempura is sweeter. Raw oysters are very fresh. There were two servers who hurried us several times during the meal. I reflected this fact into the tips, and no one said \"bye\" to us on the way out. Food 4 stars Service 2 stars."}
{"text":"Atmosphere: small, intimate, fun, awesome music Price : $8.00-$18.00 Food: 1. Japa burgers: OMFG. This burger is the bomb. Their garlic mayo and special sauce just made these tiny burgers unforgettable. $9.00  2. Spicy short ribs: OMG. These blew me away too! Perfect spicy level, awesomely marinated. Tender, truly the BEST in the city $10.50  3. Creme oysters: not as good as Guu's. The oyster were small and were just fully covered in creme and potatoes and cheese. $9.50  4. Beef sashimi: pretty good, I think I prefer thinly sliced beef rather than chunks of it $9.00  5. Oysters: super super awesome, there's a good variety to choose from. Reminds me of why I love raw oysters so much. They also give you a canister so you can dress up the oyster $2.50  Overall: pretty amazing place. Definitely be back. I'm still trying to savour everything I ate... Bit by bit"}
{"text":"Great Japanese tapas place for a North York evening out. The food is great, live DJ on weekends and a very lively atmosphere.   We shared a few dishes: -Spicy Sashimi Tortilla bites (picture below) which lived up to its name and we recommend it.  - Samurai Crunch salad was alright but in case you are looking for something healthy know that it has a lot of dressing and potato chips.  - oysters were incredible and highly recommended. - the Unagi Risotto is insane and I highly recommend it - it was the best thing we ordered! - japa-burgers (picture below) were good slider type burgers - white chocolate raspberry truffle cake was alright but didn't fit the theme and finally  - baked caramel apple pie was very good and came with taro ice cream.  Overall we were very happy and given the amount of food and sake we ordered, the pricing was very reasonable. The only draw back was that the seating was tight and uncomfortable.   We would definitely come back."}
{"text":"The food was normal.. it was certainly good.. everything we ordered tasted fine but I don't get the hype. Nothing too special"}
{"text":"I've become a frequent customer here :) I've tried more items on the menu and would definitely recommend the RISOTTO!! It's my favourite! I order that every time I'm here.  As well as the pork belly - it's fatty pork but that cholesterol tastes amazing... trust me! D:"}
{"text":"Since moving to Toronto, I've been to this restaurant 4 times already and I have been impressed with every visit. I love their oyster specials (Fanny Bays are 10 for $12 and Malpeques are $1 ea) on Tuesdays and Wednesdays, but the regular menu items are also really good!  I was really wowed by the unagi risotto - so much so that I've ordered it three times out of four visits to date. Monk fish tacos are also great, along with the grilled squid.   Best of all is the service - the girls are lovely and so friendly. It's like being at a friend's place for a big party lol. Location is great - close to my current hotel and one of my offices for work, so I'm sure I'll be back again soon."}
{"text":"**DISCLOSURE: I will be making references to a family member's connections to the establishment. This review is unbiased and has not been, in any way, shape, or form, influenced by Nome Izakaya, its management, or my family member.**  -----REVIEW-----  First-time visitor to Toronto, as I hail from the Bay Area. I simply told myself, \"You are not eating at all the popular tourist spots. You are going to eat where the locals eat.\" And that is exactly what I am doing; I am visiting Canada for one week, and hope to get around to as many eateries as possible. Came here at around 12:30am late Monday / early Tuesday morning for some eats. Here is my review on Nome Izakaya.  SERVICE: 95/100 When we arrived, the party of 7 I was in was served immediately (my uncle, who resides in North York, has connections with the waitress who served us tonight) and immediately took our order, as the kitchen was about to close for the night. Whatever we needed, our waitress took care of it. It was a bit understaffed that night, but, considering there was only ten other people in the place aside from us, it would make some sense.  FOOD: 95/100 I ordered the Japa-Burger, Baked Scallops & Shrimp, and Yam Fries; I also sampled some of the other dishes my uncle and his group of friends (which included his personal trainer, for some unknown reason), which were the short ribs, Tiger Prawns, and the Bulgogi Tacos.  The Japa-Burger is essentially sliders with fried noodle bits replacing the cheese and instead of classic lettuce, it utilizes a Japanese salad and dressing I find in most sushi restaurants back in the States. The bun was a bit soft for my personal preference, but I guess it was necessary to soak up all the juices from the beef patty and the dressing from the salad! The noodles added that satisfying crunch that I enjoy in general! This, trust me, is not your typical slider.  The Baked Scallops & Shrimp were one thing to marvel at and a treat to eat! Succulent shrimp and tender scallops just melts in your mouth. Not much more to say to that.  The Yam Fries were a bit of a disappointment. Not a big serving, considering it was ~CAN$6, and the sweet potato flavour was masked a bit. The dipping sauce was a welcome addition -- nice gingery kick to it -- but it masked that signature sweet potato flavour even more. Don't get it.  The short ribs had some well-developed flavour to them -- good kick of spice, but not too heavy to knock you out -- but they were just too chewy for me. The Tiger Prawns also had a very well-developed flavour -- creamy in the sauce, yet light -- but I found the dish to be too simple: prawns and a mini chip-like cracker to go along with it. The Bulgogi Tacos, as delicious as they were, with a mix of spice and creaminess to balance the flavours out, was basic: a tortilla with bulgogi and some vegetables coated in that salad dressing from the Japa-Burgers. I would love to see a hard-shell version of the Bulgogi Tacos and see how that goes.  VALUE: 92.5/100 I am basing this score solely off of the menu prices of the items I ordered: the Japa-Burger (~CAN$11), Yam Fries(~CAN$6), and Baked Scallops & Shrimp(~CAN$9).  $26 on a late-night meal like this is not a bad deal, don't get me wrong, but I see late-night meals as quick eats -- something like fast food, if you will. That's not to say this isn't fast food. This is quality eats. And if you're willing to sit in and eat quality, then this is worth it.  OVERALL SCORE: 94/100  -----  TL;DR: Like any tourist destination, Toronto will be filled with restaurants that trap you into paying absurd prices on food that is decent, at best. Head up to Midtown and eat at Nomé Izakaya; you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"I loved my visit to Nome! As always, let's start from first impressions and work our way down:  Decor is lovely and warm. If you want to take your date somewhere that has a great vibe and delicious food, this is it. Also a great place for you and your friends to hang out, grab a drink and some snacks (just as izakayas were meant to be). The staff is incredibly friendly and efficient. Throughout our visit, multiple staff members came by to check in, refill our drinks, and answer any questions we had.   Let's dive in to the goodies! What we had:  - Oysters:: Well...I won't lie...I am not a huge oyster person but no denying these babies were fresh and the accompanying sauces were delicious! I started off thinking I'd only have one or two...ended up having 6 and craved more.   - Sesame Salmon:: Okay I have no better way of saying this than \"fragrant & tastes as great as it smells\". It's a small dish but definitely worth trying.   - Unagi Risotto:: I ordered this originally because it was something my chef friend said \"hell no\" to. I personally love risotto and this was a different take on the traditional Italian dish. We were taking guesses on what was in it but I swear I tasted a hint of coconut in the rice. Overall, the texture and flavour was delicious and we were so full but couldn't stop eating it.   - Maguro Tataki:: Gorgeous plating & delicious food. Fresh & the texture is perfect :)   - Honey Toast:: Dessert Lovers? YOU GOTTA TRY THIS! Honey toast with honey cream, vanilla ice cream, berries and honey drizzle"}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants in Toronto and one of the few restaurants where I feel like they do Japanese fusion really well. The vibe and aesthetics of the place look great and the servers are usually pretty attentive. When ever I come here I always order the Japa Burgers, ebi-mayo and unagi risotto. As it's mentioned a million times before there are $1 dollar oysters on Tues or Wed but I believe this only applies for one or two specific types of oysters. This place does get packed really quick so if you're coming with a group be sure to try and make a reservation before hand."}
{"text":"The place was great ... Food was good make sure to get the three burgers they tasted great I hope they make bigger burgers as well from same quality"}
{"text":"Loved the decor, it was very modern but still had a warm vibe. The music was obnoxious. The server wasn't the best at the beginning.. kind of seemed like she didn't really care that we were there but later on she got better. (took forever to get our drinks, green tea took about 10-15 mins)  The food was really tasty & they gave us all a comp oyster. They don't have sushi, but they do have sashimi. The menu is kind of more like a tapas style but there aren't any pictures or really great descriptions so other than the price you wouldn't know what the portions would be like. Also, when they say it's served with veggies.. imagine after you chop up a head of broccoli and those little bits left on the cutting board... they will add maybe 3 or 4 of those and that's your side of veggies. One thing that was annoying.. I have a dairy intolerance but really wanted the green salad (which had a dairy based dressing) but the chef would not switch the dressing that came with that one for a dressing that was on another one of their salads.  Everyone really liked what they ordered."}
{"text":"Came on a Wednesday.  Was happy it was  a buck a shuck.  When I arrived I was told it was a 2 hour wait.  So we put ourselves on the waiting list and went down the street.  As soon as we were ordering at the other place, we got notified we had a table and had 15 minutes to get back.....Happy it was quick, not happy as we were just settling into another place.  Buck a shuck...you can never go wrong.  Lots of sauces, and decent job shucking it. Ordered a few different things.  The Sushi was good, nothing over the top. The sliders were good. Bulgogi tacos just average. Drink's were a bit pricey for what you got . Nothing that was mind blowing for it.  Atleast the draft beer was cold and good!  Hostess...seemed annoyed server was friendly, but slow. Service...very slow.  which is the reason for 3 star mainly.  We had to ask for an update on the taco's...almost like they were forgotten as it showed up 1.5 hours after we were seated, and finished 60 oysters and the other two dishes.  Make reso's is defn. a tip"}
{"text":"Horrible !!! I came here last night with a group of friends. And there was no one to greet us. I saw there were a lot of empty seats and the waitresses saw us but didn't come and sit us. They weren't even doing anything. We waited for almost 5-8 mins and we left after that. I think they think we weren't here for izakaya. Horrible..I will not return and I don't recommend this place! I hope this place shuts down! Pfftt!"}
{"text":"Phenomenal food! Currently my favorite restaurant in Toronto! You have to go on oyster night (a buck a shuck). Start with a massive ice cold Sapporo beer and the Japa burger sliders. The Chilean sea bass will blow your mind, probably the best thing on the menu. Get the pork belly as well only $6 a plate but so good. Oh and treat yourself to a bottle of hot sake it's da bomb *if you do go on oyster night you probably want to make a reservation a week or so in advance ;)"}
{"text":"Favourite place on Yonge! My usual order is the following only: oysters, Japa burgers, Kalbi tacos and sashimi salad! Their oysters are fresh and clean! Japa burger is so light and delicious the sauce they use is amazing!"}
{"text":"I love this place.  I spend $300 a night every time I come here. Yes I am an alcoholic and the bartender accommodates that.   I love the takoyaki even though it made me throw up twice from mixing with the alcohol. It's so good though.   I order oysters all the time and they are the best in Toronto. Also the ginger salmon roll is so good. The beef sashimi is like, my favourite.   The best thing about this place are the servers. I threw up down the stairs on New Year's Eve and they were nice to Me about it. Thank god they didn't ban me, I would have died"}
{"text":"Came in here last night for their buck a shuck deal on oysters. We had a reservation for a larger group of 10, and they accomodated us and service was great. Our server was attentive and nice.  XL Sapporo's! For a decent price. Came in a nice frosty mug, and the beer was fresh and crisp.  We ordered 100 malapaque oysters for the table, they were the oyster that was on their buck a shuck deal. They also had fanny bays for 10/$12. Oysters were shucked quickly, and came with all of the condiments. So good!  The jappa burgers were life changing. They tasted sooo good, and the presentation was great. The tacos were fantastic too, but we did get the fish tacos as well, and they were a little bit bland. But still good haha.   The atmosphere here was great too, TVs for us to watch Game 3 of the NBA Finals, without making it any less of a classy place.   Overall, all the food we got was amazing, with great presentation and detail put into it.  After all that food, tax and tip, it came up to be about $50 per person (beer included)."}
{"text":"Make a reservation or prepare to sit at the bar or wait. This place gets really busy especially during Oyster nights. Its a good thing they now have a second floor. We prefer Nome iver Kinka Izakaya formerly Guu, which is around the corner.   Good value for the tasty and creative dishes. Ok Sangria. Service is generally quick and competent. Receptionist could improve."}
{"text":"I go to Nome once in a while when I want to stay in uptown and want to have drinks and snacks. They have Dj on the weekends with house music which is unique for the area. The overall food has always been delicious and drinks are good. This review is mostly regarding the customer service. We were seated at the bar on one of their Oyster nights. We were told that we have a 2-hour limit as they get busy on Oyster nights. We started with drinks and I had a Margarita which I really liked. As we ordered the oysters and I was not even half way down into my second drink we were told that we have to get off the seats soon. I understand that we were told we only have 2hours from the beginning (which is also not acceptable for a bar, I understand some brunch places do this but that is a whole different story. When you go to a bar and you are enjoying your drink.. I don't get that), but we could see there were empty tables and seats towards the end of the restaurants and there were also empty seats at the bar and funny thing was that there was no line or anyone waiting for a table at the time. Also, once we asked the server if we could stay longer she said all the tables were reserved and once we told her that there were seats at the bar she just said \"I told you 2hours once you came in\". I don't think this is the answer you give to customer. Even if your manager told you to ask people to leave after 2hours you would kindly apologize and be like Im so sorry but we are booked or we can't. I understand that we were told we only have 2 hours, but if there are no more customers waiting to be seated and there are empty seats both at the bar and the tables, why wouldn't you offer your customer to stay longer? We would have got more food and drinks. The funny thing is that we could just pay the bill, get out of the restaurant and come back in again and get another 2 hours :)))"}
{"text":"I love all the food that I ordered there. They tastes fresh and delicious for sure. Just think sometimes if the stores get busy, then it is a little annoyed for me to wait for the hostess."}
{"text":"Great izakaya in downtown North York. Imaginative food (duck sushi, udon salad), great service. And chanting with the sake! Prices are very reasonable. It's a bit out of the way if you are coming from the centre of the city, but totally worth it and right on the subway line and close to the 401."}
{"text":"First off I'd like to mention their buck-a-shuck Tuesdays and Wednesdays; dollar oysters! We enjoyed these even though they were simply just Malpaque Oysters. I liked how they had a variety of different sauces that go well with the oysters.    I thoroughly enjoyed the tuna coin roll the most. The combination of fried sushi rice with spicy tuna,  Cucumber and cherry tomato was great. Another favourite was the aburi salmon which was a much smaller portion than expected.   The sashimi salad also had a nice tang to it and was a generous portion. Overall we were quite stuffed.   Our least favourites dishes (even though  still quite good in retrospect) were the unagi risotto (not enough eel but the rice was good with a touch of parmesan) and the monk fish tacos (nothing special)   Overall, I would return for the oysters and their Specialty rolls!"}
{"text":"I try to go to Nome once a week for oyster night. Very yummy oyster dressings!  Great menu of tasty options and drinks."}
{"text":"Awesome place with amazing drinks and delicious food. Music gets a little too loud later at night but it's ok because its a fun place to hang at late night with friends. Great music too! Love the short ribs and cocktails for sure, a must try!"}
{"text":"Food:  clean plating and presentation! Spicy chicken BBQ: a bit more spicy than I expected, not that it's a bad thing Chicken poppers: was juicy, the sauce had a the tanginess of wasabi, which was a pleasant surprise Japa-burger: sliders were good, the patty was teriyaki flavoured which went well with the ranch sauce   Service: we weren't really taken care of, but I could see that it was quite busy at the time"}
{"text":"Warning, Do not come here... These people are scammers,  We went on a Sunday and ordered the fanny bay and french kiss oysters. They gave us the smallest oysters in the world, it was nothing like the oysters pictures which others have posted. I had a feeling they aren't even the same breed of oysters that we had ordered. I ordered the habanero chicken and they said they don't make that anymore. I heard the table beside ordered it like 20 mins later and the other table got it. I ordered the baked oysters, and they said they don't have it. They hire good looking waitresses, that is the only thing I can write positive about this restaurant. I don't understand how people give them such high ratings. I am never coming back here again."}
{"text":"amazing food especially the Japa burgers. I go there at least once a week but this last time I went there the service was really slow kinda like always and the waitresses rude( ALWAYS) and I heard they opened the second floor that was really loud and all teh time I was enjoying my food all I could hear was people going up and down the stairs and some drunks screaming next to my table. overall I suggest getting take out."}
{"text":"I had granted the task of picking a foodplace for dinner to booboo who had the day off, 6 hours later, she had compiled a list of restaurants for me to choose from; booboo can't decide :( I was sold on $1 oysters=value. I asked her if we should get reservations since I'd read that it gets really busy, she said we didn't have to, and surprisingly, we were seated right away on the 2nd floor patio.   My girlfriend had only had raw oysters once before and was neutral about them so we decided to only start with 10 Malpeques, we also ordered the Korean style beef tartar, tuna sashimi, Japa burgers and the spinach and cheese baked oysters, all of which were around $10 each.   The food arrived quickly, we got the raw items first within 10 minutes and then the cooked ones afterwards. The service was perfectly average, and the patio was great as it was later in the evening as the sun set, the chairs and tables were very clean whereas I usually find patios have a varying standard of cleanliness.  The Malpeque oysters were fresh, they erred on the smaller size but the condiments made up for the value. They give you a sauce platter that includes cocktail sauce, tabasco, onion/olive oil dressing, pesto, ponzu, horseradish and their house sauce which is spicy. The house sauce and ponzu complimented the oysters the best with the onion and olive dressing being 3rd, but the pesto was just such a weird flavor combination.   My favourite was the beef tar tar, it felt like a very generous portion because of the chip to meat ratio, and the meat had a Korean bbq sauce flavor infused into it, combining with the raw egg yolk to add another unctuous level. It wasn't too salty and the quality of beef made the chunks shine like little rubies. It would've been nice if they had some pickled veg or slaw to cut the richness.  The tuna sashimi was my gfs choice, she wanted to compare it to the one we had at Guu, the portion size is much smaller, the pieces of fish were the size of a middle-aged Asian man's thumb. As with every dish, the fish was fresh and it had a textural complexity with fried onions, a tapenade and some greens. It enjoyed this dish but I can't get behind the price for the small portion.  The baked oysters were also a comparison choice to Guu, I figured 4 oysters for $10 was good value compared to Guu's 1 for $7 I think it was, but the oysters were much smaller, about 2 middle-aged Asian man thumbs big. They were drenched in butter which my gf loved, but it was a little much for me. Again, the value wasn't there for this one but this turned out to be my gf's favourite.  Lastly, the Japa burgers didn't look very exciting, just a regular slider with the regular veg and sauce, the patty to bun ratio looked all off to me but after taking a bite, my brain wtf'd a little. The meat is incredibly flavourful, similarly to the tar tar, it was infused with kbbq sauce. and the proportions of ingredients were on fleek AF. My gf didn't think much of it, but I was surprised how good it tasted, rightfully so for one of their most popular dishes. Given the price, I probably wouldn't order again unless I have a strong craving.  The dishes like most izakayas are not substantial so we went for 10 Fanny bay oysters at $12, they were mostly quite large, very fresh and creamy, and in my opinion a better deal than the Malpeques.  I feel I'm going to break my personal rule of going to the same restaurant within 3 months because of the oyster deal and the tar tar. Although I'm not a huge drinker, I'd come again to try their cocktails. As an aside, we had massive oyster breath all night, every burp was a reminder, so if you're planning on getting hot and heavy, bring some breaf mints."}
{"text":"The food quality and selection was below average.  I tried the karaage (fried chicken) which was undercooked, with overfried unseasoned batter, the sashimi salad was okay however it was drenched in a creamy dressing, the beef sliders - again drenched with sauce with tough pieces of beef.    I did enjoy the $5.00 drink special on Friday night- you can select from four blended slushy beverages.  I had the peach option and it was delicious!  The atmosphere is definitely hip, and fun and I would recommend this restaurant for going out for drinks.  They also offer $1.00 oysters on Wednesdays which sounds like a great deal."}
{"text":"I took my sister in law (who was in town for work) because the last time I came here (which was well over a year ago), their food was amazing. We came in on a Monday night and the place is pretty full for a weekday evening. Ambience is nice, casual, they have both dinner seating as well as high top seating for those who want more of a \"bar\" experience.  We ordered a variety of foods. The best part about izakayas is that their tapas style allows you to have a lot of different foods even when it's just a few people. Here are my thoughts on some of the foods I ordered:  Unagi Risotto - normally, I don't usually eat unagi (even in sushi)... but somehow the taste of the japanese unagi combined with the risotto rice and cheese, is an amazing flavour. the risotto is cooked well - the rice isn't too tough, but it's not too soft to the point where it's just mush. The hint of cheese flavour nicely complements the rice and the unagi... and gives it a nice twist to how we usually eat risotto. Def. recommend trying this one.  Monkfish tacos - I love fish tacos... so needless to say when I saw that on the menu I had to try it. I was not disappointed. The pairing of the sides along with the freshly deep fried monkfish makes it an amazing fish taco (and I've had my fair shares of fish tacos). The monkfish texture is great, the flavour is fresh and the fish has a bit of spring to it. If you aren't a fish person.. you can try their bulgogi tacos (beef)...  the bulgogi beef is a refreshing change from your typical ground beef tacos. Both options are great so I would say try the fish or the beef depending on your preferences.  Japaburger - Now, i didn't order it this time, but I've had it a few times in the past. If you love sliders... and cheese on burgers... this is for you. The portions are small, so you don't feel disgustingly full after eating the burger, it's a perfect size to taste the burger, and the burger flavour is nicely complemented by the toppings that go along with it. The beef patty is fresh and well cooked. This will definitely be a favourite for those who love burgers/sliders... almost every table usually orders one of these.  Tuna coin - Now onto their specialty rolls... but this is hands down my favourite. little dish of seaweed wrapped rice lightly fried topped with cucumber and a chunk of spicy raw tuna and a little tomato on top. Perfectly eaten in one bite, and the combination of flavours is fab. Those who love tuna sashimi, esp spicy tuna sushi/maki... this is an amazing twist to the usual and this little bites go quick after making around the table!  Tiger Shrimp - I have to say, this is probably my highlight of the evening. 6 nice sized pieces of deep fried battered tiger shrimp with a sweet and tangy sauce, accompanied by the fried shrimp chips. the flavour of the sauce is AMAZING... I can still imagine how it taste in my mouth as I'm writing this review lol. The batter is light, and not too heavy, so you don't feel gross after eating something deep fried. But yes, definitely order this if you like shrimp. I can easily eat one order of this just on my own :)  Salmon Kimchi Poke - this is one of their newer feature items, so i decided to give it a try. I was a bit disappointed. the flavours were there, your typical poke... but the pieces were so small, and it wasn't served with any chips or crackers on the side, it makes it very hard to eat actually. Also there was much more fillers than the salmon itself, so I wasn't very impressed with this dish.  BBQ duck roll - I decided to try one of their other ones after having the tuna coin... not huge fan.  most times I'm usually pretty good with eating duck... but for some reason this BBQ duck roll, the duck didn't have much seasoning on it, and taste kinda gamey. There is the sauce on top of the roll which helps flavour the duck, but in general I didn't really like it... judging by the fact that there were still 3 pieces left on the plate, it's clear that it wasn't a favourite at our table.  deep fried pork belly - another one of my favourites. I like that the deep frying actually changes the texture of the pork belly... most of us are used to pork belly being soft and melting in your mouth. The batter gave it a bit of crunch and the pork belly inside actually had more texture than i expected. It comes with a drizzle of sauce on top (assuming i'ts hoisin)... and it's quite nice - we really enjoyed it :)  Short ribs - now they advertise this on their menu as the best in the city. I don't know if it's best in the city, but it's certainly one of the better ones I've had :) I really enjoyed their short ribs, the meat is packed with flavour, it's cooked medium so the short ribs are juicy and tender. Those who love beef and short ribs, definitely get an order of this.  Last but not least... get their sweet bread!! honey bread brick with ice-cream... perfect for sharing this dessert at the end of an epic delicious meal :) AND... $1 oysters Tues & Wed nights!"}
{"text":"It has been awhile but finally back and was not disappointed. The food and service was great. Also heard there might be a second location coming soon. Some of the highlights were the oyster specials from Monday to Wednesday, tiger shrimps (ebi mayo), japa burgers, bulgogi and monkfish tacos, and most of their rolls are pretty good. In the past I also enjoyed the udon salad, slammin salmon, ane deep fried pork belly. Great atmosphere for a fun night out!"}
{"text":"It's so dark in there that I can't see what I'm eating. The food wasn't great anyway. In fact, there is nothing \"izakaya\" about this place.   The music is also too loud. I felt like I was in the club. I can't hear the person sitting across from me.   There's simply nothing great about this restaurant so I do not recommend it."}
{"text":"Oysters are sooooooooo good. Super fresh and very tasty!! I didn't even need any of the condiments because they were so flavourful and fresh. No grit or bitterness. I would definitely come back for the oysters alone. The rest of the menu is your typical Asian fusion snack bar, pretty busy during the week and a lot of college kids."}
{"text":"Came here on a Wednesday night around 6:30 and the restaurant was already starting to get full. We got the japaburger to start which ended up to be really good. They were the size if sliders and came in 3s for us so it was enough for us to share. We also also got the sashimi salad which was decent, and the karage where the wasabi sauce was mediocre  (I wish it had more of a kick).   Overall I would recommend coming back to this place. Food is decent but it gets pretty loud so it's hard to hear sometimes. Prices average $9 per dish which is pretty expensive but it's what's expected of an izakaya place in Toronto"}
{"text":"I came to Nome on Tuesday for their buck a shuck special. The person who brought me here is a regular and thank god he made reservation, because there were already people lining up when I came at 6:15pm.  Environment: Right off the Sheppard-Yonge station, the restaurant is super convenient. The ambiance is great, it's like a sports bar almost with the TVs live broadcasting the Jays game when I was here. I would say the restaurant is quite loud because of the small space and the crowdedness. We were seated at the back where half of the seats are on a long bench on the inside and the other half are tall bar stools on the outside. I kinda don't like this arrangement because the tall stools weren't comfortable to sit on.  Food: There were 2 types of oysters on special pricing, the malpeque and the fanny bay. The malpeque is the cheaper one for $1 each, but it's also smaller and the meat is a lot thinner. The fanny bay is $1.25 each and 8 for $10, in my opinion this is the better value because the oysters are bigger and so much more meatier. However, if you're new to having oysters it might be better to start with the malpeque because the taste is lighter. I ordered a mix of malpeque and fanny bay and found that they were both really good and totally fresh. No food poisoning. They give you a large variety of sauces for you to put on the oysters for flavor. I also ordered the fried pork belly and it was terrific as well. Though it's $7.5 for 5 tiny pieces of meat, much like traditional Japanese cuisine which they go for quality over quantity. My friend, who is the regular here, also suggested other dishes such as the balsamic beef strip, mini burger, bulgogi taco, and the wasabi octopus sashimi.  Service: Even though technically only 1 server is assigned to your table, you can also ask the other servers for help as well. They all seem very nice and professional, well knowledgable of the menu items. If you tell them beforehand that you're splitting bills, they would make sure to get your names down and actually remember them!"}
{"text":"I do not recommend this place. and I personally will not be coming back again. It doesn't matter how food is when you hire the most incompetent hostess to manage the front of the house to chase your customers away.   We arrived at 6pm to a half empty restaurant and was told it was an hour wait.  After an hour, we approached the hostess again, and she informed us, she has \"no idea, it could be another 30 mins or 60 mins, or not ever...\"  The hostess doesn't seem to know what she is doing and is completely incapable of doing her job because the restaurant is NOT even FULL!!! After this we left!!  I am not upset about the waiting. If the restaurant is unable to accommodate our table of 5, just tell me from the beginning, so I can go eat somewhere else.  The fact that the hostess made us (with young children) wait an hour and then tell me after an hour of waiting that she doesn't know if she can give me a table at all is mind boggling.   There are many great restaurants in Toronto. Don't waste your time and money here."}
{"text":"This place is all about quality. Really fun with a large party because you can share the dishes. Drinks here are delicious too."}
{"text":"My husband and I came here on a date night and oh my, this is the best tasting sushi/japanese food I had in Toronto!  This definitely set the bar for me based on the quality of their fish and presentation.  It is a little on the expensive side but highly recommend it if you're up for a fancy night out."}
{"text":"The place has a great atmosphere and it stays open later than most izakayas on town. I love the oyster nights on tues and wed. But come early or book a reservation cause it can get packed easily. They have a great selection of apps and entrees to share. But my favourite is the sashimi and oysters here. And their sake bottles are not too expensive which is a plus. The only problem is sometimes they run out of some selections which is a little dissapointing, however they try their best to provide with other sake recommendations. I would come here again."}
{"text":"Great food, attentive service , young Asian crowd is a little noisy Tempura shrimp was OUTSTANDING. Unusual combinations of food, beautifully presented."}
{"text":"FYI: This is my first ever review of any restaurant.    I love ALMOST everything about this restaurant.  I just had a birthday dinner party of 16-18 people and everyone had a great time.   POSITIVES:   Food, no doubt, deserves five stars for taste, innovation and being absolutely superb.  If you're looking for a trendy Japanese-west-bar fusion - this is an amazing choice. Everyone from my party shared the same consensus that the food was really good.  You can pick anything on that menu - you can pretty much close your eyes and randomly point at an item - and be blown away.  My favourite items include: tiger shrimp, japa burger, double salmon roll, creamy mentai potato, oysters.  But beware the portions of some dishes are small - like magura & avocado tartare is sooo good but so tiny.  So let it be expected that each guest would order about 2-3 dishes.   FIVE STARS  Drinks: We ordered 2 pitchers of Asahi and 2 pitchers of Red Sangria.  The Sangria was really good but I couldn't taste the alcohol.  Nonetheless, I enjoyed the drinks.  FOUR STARS  Ambiance - the place is smallish and cozy.  Not crowded with people but certainly a bit tight for space.  The restaurant dims the lights at a certain time lit by trendy glowy lights.  Not too loud.  Had a really great atmosphere. FOUR STARS  Service - was good.  The waitresses were friendly and courteous and, for such a busy restaurant, they truly worked really hard to get to all their patrons.  Sometimes, they took a while before we can get their attention but overall they were great dealing so many people at a time.  They were diligent on details like including a knife with our Japa Burger order when they saw that we were going to share them. FOUR STARS  Overall: the food, ambiance and service: 4.5 stars.  I would definitely go again.   NEGATIVES:  1. They charged us for a slice of birthday cake. One of my party guests told the restaurant that it was my birthday and hoped they'll do something cool for me.  Well, they did.   Towards the end, they placed a slice of yummy red velvet cake in front of me with an intense flame-throwing sparkler.  The entire restaurant erupted in Happy Birthday song.  We enjoyed the gesture.   BUT, when the bill came, we were charged $8 + tax for that slice of cake which we didn't exactly 'order' nor did we know we were going to be charged.  It left us kinda puzzled and partly stunned.  Usually, restaurants do this on-the-house and, given the size of our party with everyone paying almost $30-35 (NOT including the price of alcohol which I covered), it would've been nice to give this to us for free.  Since birthdays is really a time for happy celebration, my guests decided to suck it up and pay for the cake.   Strangely, it reminded me of something that Mr. Krabs (from Spongebob Square Pants) or Thénardier (from Les Mis) would do.     2. What DJ?  Also, according to the website, it said they have a DJ on Saturdays.  Not only did I not see a DJ, there's no room to dance in the restaurant.  :)"}
{"text":"Només has been around for quite awhile now. Their speciality is the $1 oysters on Tuesday and Wednesday. I remember how packed it used to be and unless you've got a reservation in the evening, you're not going to get in!  All things aside, I think this place serves average izakaya food. I honestly do not recommend eating the oysters or beef tartare here as I tried more than a handful of time (fourth time being a benefit of the doubt) and having a terrible stomach ache each time. My go to choice would be the ebi mayo (deep fried battered shrimp with sweet chili mayo) and the bulgogi tacos and burger sliders. Don't get the sushi! The sushi is level 1. If you go here for sushi... Don't even bother. Just walk across to sushi Moto. That place is a GEM."}
{"text":"Always full, Mid-week $1 oysters, varied menu offering shareable dishes from sushi, to wagyu beef sliders and fresh shucked oysters. For me, Nome is like the Applebee's of Izakaya: Consistent, good food, but not uber authentic.  We save this resto as a mid-week date when we're craving fresh shucked oysters!  If you're rolling in on the weekend, reservations are recommended!"}
{"text":"Went there a few times and the food was great. I got the $1 oysters, pork belly, one of the rolls and eel risotto. The best were the oysters and the pork belly. The service was a bit slow but it was pretty busy while I was there. Great music and atmosphere though. A bit too pricey for me but I wouldn't mind going occasionally."}
{"text":"Great place for a snack   Waitresses are very attractive just like everyone says but I really though they would utilize their good looks and charms to encourage us guys to buy more. But seeing as I was there with another female guest I don't think that would have been appropriate. Maybe if I was there with a group of guys then it would make sense.  One thing that was pointed out to me while I was there was that all the girls should sit on the inside cushion seats while the guys sit on the outer seats. This is preferred so that us guys don't stare at the attractive waitresses as they walk by. I still sat on the inside seats and I'm pretty sure I was the only guy to do so.  Anyway, on to the actual review.  Beef sashimi $8.70 - this was the first time trying beef sashimi. In terms of the taste there really isn't much flavor. The texture was a bit slimy with the raw egg but I wouldn't mind eating it again (3 stars).  Marinated short ribs $9.30 - this was advertised on the menu as arguably Toronto's best and sure it did taste great but I wouldn't say its the best I've had. There are plenty of Korean BBQ places which can top this place (4 stars).  Japa Burger $8.80 - simply awesome in flavor with a great sauce. I was tempted to order another it was so good (5 stars).  Service was quick as I was there on a Thursday evening and arrived pretty early at around 6:30pm"}
{"text":"If you like oysters this is the place to go on Wednesdays: oysters $1/each. We also ordered a few Japanese tapas that were all really tasty. For drink we had saporo beer and red sake sangria (I recommend, it's with real fruit, really refreshing). The waitress was nice, but talked too fast which was hard to understand most of the times. Besides that, all really good/fresh and I'll go back for sure!"}
{"text":"First time going to Nomé with my boyfriend. It has been on my bookmarked list for awhile. It was a Friday night and waited about 20 minutes for a seat by the bar. The hostess was very friendly even though it was pretty packed and a busy night.   Got sat by the bar but it was spacious enough and comfortable as well. The service was quick and food came in a timely manner despite the place being busy. We were checked on and had a pleasant experience here.   We ordered the following: Tako-Waso, Grilled Beef Tongue, Baked Oysters, Spicy Kimchi Salmon Poke, Monkfish Tacos and Grilled Squid.   My favourite were the Monkfish tacos, it was full of flavour and very fresh. I think it was tasty and would have it again. My least favourite is the Baked Oysters, unfortunately it just wasn't to my liking.   The beer was also awesome! I enjoy a good ice cold glass of Sapporo especially to start off the weekend. I definitely wouldn't mind coming back to try out more of their dishes."}
{"text":"To start, the staff and management made good on a reservation that went missing. It was a busy night and we had a reso.  It was lost but the staff made it happen and really went out of their way to make it right with some very nice gestures.  The food was very good.  Best bets were the shrimp, sliders and salad.  The rest was great too.  Defiantly worth a try and a refreshing change for the area."}
{"text":"We had reservations for three at 6:30 but they told us we missed our \"6pm reservations\" when we arrived. Then the hostess told us it was our mistake, not hers. Then she said she could sit is at the bar in 30 minutes.when we spoke to the manager he did get us seating at the bar, but the 3rd seat was a stool on the side of the bar making it very cramped and uncomfortable. The hostess said she would work on getting us a real seat, but she never did. The food was good, but the service was extremely bad"}
{"text":"This is one of my favourite Izakaya places in Toronto. The food and service are excellent, the prices are very reasonable and the ambiance is fun but not too overwhelming/loud.  We came here for a friend's birthday and ordered a variety of dishes to share. Would definitely recommend the Shrimp Udon Salad ($8.30) - seafood and vegetables on top of a bed of udon noodles, very unique and filling.  The ambiance of the izakaya is a bit more toned down than some of the other ones but still very fun. They have really cheap shooters and sake bombs. Overall a great vibe and the friendly staff/quick service make it even better."}
{"text":"Abure salmon donburi... is so freaking good that I had to get a second helping. Like you don't understand I usually don't order seconds at izakayas but hooooly.... it like called to me. Honestly there is enough salmon for everything and just enough sauce and oh man I can go on and on.   The service here is always the best! Never have to deal with 1 or 2 servers or the waiting for one to come out game. Always walking and all super helpful. Also again the owner Patrick pulling us through with a table haha. We first reserved a bit late but since my gf knows him (not really me) he pulled through haha! Such an awesome owner!   Defintiely one of the best places to go to for food or atmosphere or drinks! Also don't forget their weekly deals!! Just be sure to call in and reserve a spot otherwise you might get stuck at the bar or wait a while!"}
{"text":"Great price for oyster on Tuesday and Wednesday. All the other food are also good. Try short ribs, tiger shrimps and the mini burger."}
{"text":"Came here after work with a friend and loved it so came back again after work the following week.   This place is great to hang out and relax after work. But hard to have a heart felt conversation as the place is super loud and I had to scream across the table to talk to my sister. There are daily specials so definitely check them out.   Great drinks. Try the mango chili frosty with sake and rum. Delicious!!  Food is good too.  Fried pork belly was interesting, each slice thick and deep fried. The japa burger was delicious and highly recommended.  The oyster specials on Tues and Wed were fresh with a good selection of condiments. The tuna and avocado tartar, takoyaki, and ox tongue were all tasty.   Nice trendy vibe, great drinks menu, reservations are highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Went there on a Wednesday night because I had an oyster craving at 9pm, so hubby called to see if it was full house. Luckily the girl said that they would have a table available for 10pm. Reserved!  We ordered two dozen oysters, sashimi salad and grilled calamari. The oysters were definitely worth the late night trek. They were fresh and the condiments offered definitely made it tasty!! The two other dishes were just so so...  Service was good and prompt, no attitude from any staff as mentioned by some other helpers. Good place to grab a drink and snack.  Will definitely be back whenever oyster craving hits again!"}
{"text":"I love a good Izakaya and this place was great.  Tuna tango - good but I would probably try something else next time as so many great options. Salmon aburi donburi - so light and fresh. Downright yummy  Ebi mayo - outstanding, wow! Bulgogi tacos - delicious and bigger than expected. Pork belly - deep fried bacon. So bad for you but so delicious! Tacoyaki - like an octopus hush puppy. Good.  We were startled how low the bill was for the quality of food. Food 5/5!  The service was good but there were problems in the kitchen which our server apologized profusely for.  Will definitely return."}
{"text":"Since Guu was pretty much booked up for Victoria Day dinner, my family decided to book it up the subway to Nomé, having passed by here several times but never going in to eat.  I will begin by saying this, service was very slow that night. It seemed they were on weekday schedule, because I only saw a total of two waiters/waitresses, despite the fact the place was pretty much full house when I arrived at 8pm.  With that aside, everything else about the food was great! The japa-burger was unanimously the highlight of our meal, and we ordered two plates of that for the three of us. We also ordered the black cod (good as well), marinated squid (average), beef tongue (very good), beef sashimi (Korean style, good), and the kusshi oysters (excellent). We'll definitely return for one of the oyster special days, because I've never had better oysters than here!  If they have better service as in more waiters during peak times, I might give it a 4.5. Right now, however, I believe 4 stars would suffice."}
{"text":"I would still give this place a 2.5 stars after visiting on a Tuesday evening for their $1 oysters (well, $1.10 for Fanny Bay oysters, $1 for Malpeques). The oysters were huge and meaty. The sauces available were good.    Unfortunately, the other dishes we ordered were not that good. The sliders were good but could be because it was drenched in sauce. The grilled squid was a huge disappointment and small, the karage was decent but only very few pieces and not that crispy. The yam fries were really crispy and came in large pieces. We also had the beef tartare which was pretty good. It was sweet and was served with pita chips. You have ask for more pita chips though because they give you only 5 pieces, which is definitely not enough.   The music is incredibly loud at this place that you cannot hear people talking at all. They should really turn it down as it's a restaurant, not a club.   Also, what bugged me a bit was the professionalism of the hostess. She was on the phone with another potential customer at the time and I guess there was a mix-up with the reservation that day, so when the hostess hung up, she spent a few seconds complaining to her colleague about the customer while we were still standing in front of her waiting to be seated. I get that it's stressful at any work place sometimes, but complaining about a customer while other customers are listening and in front of you is just not appropriate or professional.  In terms of food, there are other better izakayas in the neighbourhood, particularly closer to Finch. However, I probably would come back mainly for their $1 oyster deal."}
{"text":"Updating my review for the recent oysters night we had here :)  $1 oysters (or rather, $1 off the original price) on Tues/Wednes -  Got two dozens of Malpeque, half a dozen of Kusshi and Kunamoto - where the latter two were pricier.  Besides the differences in size and shells, I didn't actually taste a huge difference among the three types of oysters.  I like my oysters with horse radish usually, but this time had Tabasco sauce with the Malpeque and still so good.   Also got the seafood udon, tako wasabi (octopus infused with wasabi and wrapped with seaweed), yam fries (tastes like any other yam fries but still so good), and double salmon roll (I wasn't a fan of the grilled salmon unfortunately.. the sashimi on the outside of the roll was tastier).  This was shared among four people and came to $35/person after tax - not bad especially with the amount of oysters we all had.  Overall, Nome has a really live ambiance and makes a great hangout place for groups of friends - there's a DJ every Friday so it's worth checking out but definitely with a reservation!"}
{"text":"Nome is one of my fave \"go to\" places when you just want great food and can't handle disappointment. The atmosphere is very unique. There's always 90's hip hop which brings high school nostalgia and you feel like you're always surrounded by friendly people. Patrick the owner is a great host and is always making sure everyone is having a good time! Lastly Nome is great for bringing out of towners to experience great Toronto eats! My favorite dishes: lobster roll, wasabi salad, Chilean sea bass, the cod, and baked oysters!"}
{"text":"Nomé calls themselves an authentic Japanese izakaya on their website but I totally disagree. The restaurant does have vibes like an izakaya but the food doesn't exactly hit the spot as an izakaya if that makes sense. I would call this place an Asian fusion spot instead. So if you're looking for a place that is more like an izakaya, I would suggest places like Kinka or Kingyo instead.   Here is what we ordered at Nomé:  (1) Fanny Bay Oysters: Nomé has oyster specials on Tuesdays and Wednesdays. You get 8 fanny bay oysters for $10, which is a decent deal. The oysters are decent (fresh enough) and the sizes are reasonable. There was also a variety of sauces that you can put on your oysters.  (2) Sesame Salmon: We originally saw a picture on Yelp of this dish that looked pleasing. But anyway, DO NOT ORDER THIS DISH. This dish was a big joke. The salmon was diced into small pieces and there was no garlic or chives on the salmon as how the menu described this dish. They literally put sesame oil over the salmon and called it a day. The portion was so small and it was almost $9!!!! The salmon was also worse than AYCE quality. Such a disappointment. It seems like you really need to follow the chef suggestions on the menu or else things seem to be a miss. One star docked because of this.  (3) Japa-Burgers: Okay, this was one of the best dishes I have tried at Nomé. The onions, the smoky barbecue sauce and the rib eye meat all complemented each other. Highly recommend this.  (4) Monkfish Tacos: The portions were quite large for these tacos. However, I wasn't crazy about the monkfish being that deep fried. It tasted more so like fried cod and the distinct flavour of the monkfish was kinda destroyed by frying the fish. However, the yuzu tartar really complemented the taco.   (5) Lobster Fantasy Speciality Roll: The portions were quite large for this roll. However, it was quite pricey at around almost $20. In my opinion, the roll was on the dry side but you can still taste pieces of the lobster. It was okay but I don't think I would order again since it was quite pricey.   The service at this place is also questionable. Sometimes, it's good... but sometimes it is not so good. I found it hard to flag down our waitress. Another star docked for this as well.   All in all, I would come back to the restaurant again for their Oyster specials but I wouldn't exactly come to get my izakaya craving satisfied."}
{"text":"Just a decent izakaya place. The oysters during buck a shuck are very small but that is to be expected (at least they taste fresh)"}
{"text":"Been here a couple times for drinks and the $1 oyster deal.  Fanny Bay oysters were good. Chicken Karage isn't bad.   Not very Izakaya like. Maybe it's because I'm used to and enjoy the Japanese style of a friendly and sometimes boisterous greeting at other spots.   Good place to go to for drinks and eats in the Yonge/Shep area."}
{"text":"Good place to come to for a drink and for the eye candy of waitresses, which I bet everybody comes here for....yea you know what i mean.....oh yea don't forget the $1 oysters on Tuesday and Wednesday, but honestly I didn't really enjoy it that much but hey you get what you pay for....this place is always packed especially on the weekends so prepare to wait....atmosphere is pretty sheek and modern, a little too dark and loud for my liking but its a hip place to come with a bunch of friends....the little sliders were pretty good but other than that the food was mediocre and quite pricy too, I rather goto guu for izakaya"}
{"text":"Tiger shrimp is so good and the restaurant should be changed name before. I like there so much a bit price The restaurant is so popular on Yonge and I had been to there many times and recommend to my friends as well."}
{"text":"Staff was really friendly. Food was delicious and came quickly. Enjoyed the ambience other than the fact that the music was too loud and some of the dishes had a tad bit too much sauce but other than that it was a great meal."}
{"text":"While this place doesn't have Guu's hype, the food and desserts are better in my opinion. The oysters are always popular but recommend also trying the tiger shrimp, beef tacos, octopus, japa burger, and any of their 3 salads. Plus top your meal off with the fudge cake from cheesecake factory."}
{"text":"I get take out from here on occasion. It has a trendy atmosphere and serves a variety of interesting food options! The price is moderate and the service was great for me."}
{"text":"This place is great! Everyone's really friendly and the food is on point. The only thing I wish I knew before going was that it's a tad pricey. Otherwise it's a great take on Japanese tapas"}
{"text":"alright. Since my first time stepping feet into Nome, I've managed to make it at least a bi-weekly event. There were weeks when I came twice a week. *shakes tiny asian fists* you are the reason my wallet is always empty!!! But yes, Nome still manage to excite me and impress me. Great food and amazing hospitality. Honestly I only expected mediocre food and bitchy service before. I mean, this is a posh place packed with hot gals. I was expecting Devil Wears Prada or Mean Girls treatment. However, once you sit down, you realize they are all sweethearts (including Pat, who's a teddy bear)!"}
{"text":"If you want a good, well priced Izakaya in North York - come here!  Fresh Oysters & Japa Burgers are my favourites!  Their sushi and sashimi is pretty good.  Always on par and fresh on point.  I live just up the street - so that's a huge plus for me.   When I am craving for Izakaya, I don't have to travel all the way to downtown for one.   All you North Yorkers out there looking for a decent Izakaya, go to Nome!"}
{"text":"Service is great, efficient. The quality of food at the same level as a chain like jack astors or milestones except its japanese. Prices reasonable. Good for groups."}
{"text":"Yum yum yum. I went with a large group of friends. The service was very good, and I love that they let you make reservations online.   We got so many dishes to try. My favourite was the duck and fries!   Only downside is there was very limited vegetarian options. :("}
{"text":"Came here on a Tuesday with my girlfriend for their buck-a-shuck deal. They have a ton of small, almost tapas-like plates that are perfect for sharing. We got the pork gyoza which were absolutely amazing, as well as the sashimi plate (really fresh), tuna bites of some sort with this awesome spicy sauce, monkfish tacos (decent) and a couple dozen oysters.   The only negative was that the oysters took forever to be served. We ordered them as soon as we sat down and they were the last things we got. It seems like most people who come to the restaurant are ordering them on Tuesdays, not sure if maybe they can just start shucking them a couple hours earlier to prep."}
{"text":"I went with a large party on a Friday night.  The atmosphere was loud and the wait staff actually wasn't that attentive at the time.    We had multiple orders of food: edamame, mac and cheese, wings, other izakaya stuff.  I generally enjoyed them all.  The pitchers were very key to the good night we had as well as the sake bombs.  However, I do wish the wait staff was more attentive, but they could have just been super busy being a Friday."}
{"text":"Great place to go for catching up with friends while enjoying that $1/oyster on certain days of the week. Only thing is it does get pretty loud and packed, so the last time when I went they had a 2hrs seating limit; which is also understandable because it was very busy that night. One of my favourite izakayas uptown. Would recommend their beef tar tar as well."}
{"text":"ONE DOLLAR OYSTERS!  If you like oysters, this is absolutely the place to come! If you like Japanese tapas as well, this is even more the place to come!  The Fanny Bays Oysters are larger with a sweet taste- although you only get 10 for $12 they are big enough to split the difference, and they taste great!  I highly recommend making a reservation a day in advance and going with a friend. Split a dozen or two oysters then try some of their tapas dishes to share. The tiger shrimp are spectacular and are coated in a very unique sweet sauce.  To go with your copious amounts of dollar oysters and few tapas dishes I suggest getting either an XL Sopporo, which comes in a freezing cold glass, or try one of their cocktails.  Cheap but great oysters, excellent Japanese tapas dishes, and amazing drinks makes this one of my favourites in Toronto."}
{"text":"I came here with three other fab Yelpers for the Wednesday Oyster special, where I had a moment of realization: I don't actually like raw oysters - I prefer them smoked or baked. Now that I've gotten that out of the way, let's move on:  The good: I'd happily recommend the NAMA Gure Sawa (Fresh Grapefruit + Vodka + Soda), my favorite order of the night. The white sangria was also good, albeit pricey at $27 for a pitcher.   The sashimi salad is nice, but order the Samurai Crunch if you want something different and fun - it's not every day you're served potato chips on top of salad, right? The deep fried tiger shrimp tempura with sweet chilli mayo (Ebi-Mayo) was the best appetizer, but it's hard to go wrong with deep fried anything. IMHO burgers are typically a yawn-fest, so I was surprised that the other standout menu item here is the Japa-Burger. Not especially exotic, but plenty of flavor to go around.   The \"meh\": The BIG Beef roll was too big to eat without breaking apart into messy lumps and otherwise rather forgettable. The Japanese Chicken Poppers seemed somewhat undercooked or just off-tasting. Many menu items were sold out by the time we arrived at 6:30 and they politely requested that we vacate our table after 2 hours (although they didn't reinforce the rule with much authority). Considering that our food took a while to arrive and we were still eating, perhaps they gave us some leeway.   Overall it's more good than \"meh\". I'd consider coming back here since it's kind of close to home, but Guu Izakaya still owns the Toronto scene (according to me). On an unrelated note, the bathrooms are very clean."}
{"text":"Not my first time here, but t is my first time here since I started using Yelp. Horrible experience with their food and service this time!!  Came here on Tuesday night for $1 oysters, they served Malpecs for $1 each and small size Fanny Bay for for $10/8.  Not a bad deal to drive business. The place was packed full!!  Deep Fried Pork Belly - was ok, but not worth re-ordering. Texture was in between crispy and chewy. Didn't have much flavour. Relies on sauce for it to m tasty.  Duck Roll - this menu item jumped out to me as super interesting because I like duck. All of us felt this roll was pretty disappointing!  The maki was falling apart. Duck meat was cold - I guess it was planned this way, but didn't taste good.   Chicken Karaage - i love this dish!! But didn't taste good here.. chicken karaage is boneless dark meat deep fried in a bit of batter izakiya style.. it's usually super juicy and therefore juices just oozes out when you bite into it.. tonight's chicken karaage was dry, therefore no juice and no flavour and no texture   Beef TarTar - whey too much sauce (sesame oil). Just imagine raw ground beef with too much oil.. beef dish was mushy.. we didn't finish this dish and told them to take it away..  Double Chocolate Godiva Cheesecake - the menu offered 2 different kinds of cheesecakes \"direct from the Cheesecake Factory\"!!!!!!! This item is also a Cheesecake Factory dish, but didn't say on the menu it was from the Cheesecake Factory. We asked the manager specifically if it was really from the Cheesecake Factory and he assured me yes, so we ordered it. IT'S MOST DEFINITELY NOT REAL CHEESECAKE FACTORY. The colour was off, the real one is much darker in colour, the texture was off, the real one has a richer harder texture to the Cheesecake, this one was soft.. We also didn't finish this dish and told the manager to take it back because it was real Cheesecake Factory Cheesecake like he promised.  We asked for the bill, 5 appetizer dishes plus drinks was $400 plus tip for a table of 5, cuz we like to drink when we go izakya. We prepared cash to pay the bill, asked to have word with the manager..  Told the Mgr the service tonight was horrible, oysters we ordered to take a long long time to come. Beer pitchers and sake took a long time to come because they weren't even punched in and therefore never came, so we have to re-ask for our drinks throughout the night. He just starred a little and said \"but we EVENTUALLY served you drinks, RIGHT?\" .. we were planning to mentioned poor attitude from 2 of their staff.. but then the way the Mgr handled the conversation so far.. we were just like.. forget it and just took our tip back..  Food experience was 2/5 Staff Service was 2/5 Manager was 1/5 Atmosphere and trendiness was 4/5  Although this was not our first time coming here, non of us with ever revisit.. with so many other similar options near by.."}
{"text":"Serving Japanese tapas as my brother in law described it - Nome is another trendy restaurant with unique menu on Yonge Street. Came on a Friday night and course of the place was beyond packed! With reservation however we were seated immediately!   Their menu consisted of your typical Japanese dishes but with interesting twists! Monkfish tacos, Unagi risotto, Cali styled sashimi donburi, fried pork belly with seaweed paste? There's no other restaurant with any of these items on their menu!   We sampled large portion of the menu - personal favorites: Korean beef tartare (unbelievably flavorful), unagi tempura (loved the sweet tempura batter), pork belly (crispy and fatty - delish!), and grilled black cod (flakey and beautifully cooked!).   Others that we tried that we thought were just okay: monkfish taco (tasted like McDonald's fish filet sandwich with the dressing), Cali style sashimi donburi (way too much mayo), unagi risotto (the rice had dissolved into mush), fried calamari (not too memorable), wara yaki (I wasn't too big on the smoked salmon, but my husband loved it).   Overall - although there were many misses, I can honestly eat the Korean beef tartare every day (I would mix it into every carb I can get my hands on). With so many more options to choose from, I would love to sample the remaining unique menu!"}
{"text":"I wasn't sure what to expect coming for the first time for a friend's party. We had a table for 20+ people and two different servers took our order. They don't do a very good job counting their cups and utensils because my side of the table was short 1 cup, and 1 knife despite everyone having 1 fork each.   Back to the servers: one took orders per table (we had 2 tables, one of 9 and the other with a bit more than 9). Food came pretty quick....for the other table. No exaggeration: they were on their desserts before my side of the table even got their first dish. And then when 6/9 people on my table got their food, it took another 10 minutes for food to arrive for the other 2. And for me? My food came last when everyone else was already halfway through their meal at my table. The other table already finished their food. I was pretty peeved. I ordered the Aburi Salmon Donburi, and when I asked where it was after food was delivered to 6/9 of my table, I was told it would take a while. But the real kicker is when everyone else had their food, one of the servers came around asking if everyone got their food yet! What the heck? I've been waiting a good half hour while everyone else had been munching away. I was relieved, but in a crappy mood when my food finally arrived. I honestly think they forgot because they gave food to everyone by name, but they almost put my dish at the other table and didn't know who ordered it, making me believe they only started making the dish when one of their servers asked if everyone got their food yet.   Eventually I informed them that I had been sharing a cup with my partner to their surprise. They also took our pitcher away to refill and then gave it to the next table, leaving them with 2 pitchers and us, 0. Pls count properly.   Food wise, the dish was alright. The price point was also decent for the quality provided. One concern that I should have read up on yelp first was the tendency for stomach aches, because immediately when I left the premise, I felt incredibly nauseated. I informed my friends who seemed fine, so it MAY have been the yolk on my Aburi salmon donburi. Overall, a very underwhelming experience. I can only say our server was not the worst server I've ever had."}
{"text":"Best spot in the city for buck-a-shuck binge (All my cheapos, hit up this place on a Tuesday or  a Wednesday evening, but ensure to make a reservation), Try out Tiger shrimp and the burgers. I prefer Malpeque oysters over the premium ones. Malpeque oysters aren't as meaty but also not as fishy as the premium ones. Sauces are on point too"}
{"text":"There is nothing to complain about Nome, the service was great and the food was very fresh.  The interior of the restaurant is very unique, it almost gives a \"dinner vibe\" even if you go there for lunch.  I've had their oysters, rolls, and beef tartar, all of which are very fresh and tasty. They have a great selection in their menu, and they also have specials every day (e.g. $1 oysters). I would recommend it for a large group of people, and also for a a 2 people date."}
{"text":"Nome is always a great place to go to whether it be because of their amazing ambiance or unique freshly cut $1 oysters on Tues/Weds. I find myself always wanting to go here..its an ideal place for a date minus the loud music which I also really like as well. Their music typically plays old school R&B which I'm really into right now so if you aren't then you may have to consider another choice. But I highly recommend Nome Izakaya because of their delicious food, great ambiance, and amazing atmosphere. Their also building a rooftop patio soon so if your in the area of Yonge & Sheppard then I highly recommend going to Nome Izakaya."}
{"text":"I'm not a connoisseur of this cuisine, but I came here with friends who know the style of food better than I do. We had 6 people in our group and ordered lots and lots of dishes to share. nothing was a major disappointment, but some things weren't really my cup of tea. The funny thing is we all took a liking in totally different dishes, so there was something to suit everyone and everyone found a dish they thought was particularly good. For me it was the calamari.. mouth watering just thinking about it! I would come back here for what I would consider an unusual and pleasantly surprising dining experience -- and the nice ambience in the restaurant doesn't hurt!"}
{"text":"My gf loves oysters and I like them too. Tuesdays and Wednesdays are oyster days so you get 1 dollar oysters. They are one dollar each so you get what you pay for :P But it's always a good time. I love sitting at the bar it's so chill and it feels different than other bars you would go to.  It's a cool place and gets packed on Tues/Wed & Fri/Sat It's meant to have that Japanese style so there's no Soju there, they want to be as authentic as possible it seems which I think is great. Asahi & Sapporo beers are served either on Tap or bottle/can.   Cheers~  Steve"}
{"text":"If only their salmon were a little more fresh, I would have given then the fourth star. Everything else were great except the following: the Sashimi Salad has a very good dressing, but the salmon colour was completely pink and not orange so they were bland and take away from the dressing; the salmon for the double salmon roll is the same thing, and I can imagine how good would it have been if only the salmon were fresh. The staff are friendly and gave excellent service. There is no way to fault them on that. The only pain with visiting this place would be the parking. Spaces behind and around the restaurant are very limited and very tight. Lighting at night is limited, so be mindful of that."}
{"text":"My favorite spot for dinner, especially when Im eating dinner late. My favorite nights are Tuesdays and Wednesdays because $1 oysters!! It's best to make reservations especially on weekends because they do get super busy and it is quite a small place. But their food is so good and consistent! I always get the bulgogi tacos and japa burgers. You can always add an extra taco/burger because it only comes in 3 (in case you have an even # of people, or you're just hungry).   Other recommended and tried:  Unagi risotto, Deep fried pork belly, Mac & cheese"}
{"text":"Love coming here for their $1 oyster nights! We were able to make a reservation over the phone even though there wasn't anything available on OpenTable the day before. Food, drinks and service are always great here. Perfect for catching up with friends or date night!"}
{"text":"Came for the $1 oysters, there mad small.  Nothing really stood out as great and i ordered a lot.  Jap burgers were overdressed with mayo, kinda gross, shortrib was burnt and everything else was meh...  Too noisy and rammed, if you wanna go dont do it on tuesday and wednesday, $1 oysters arent worth the bs"}
{"text":"This same location has many restaurants come and go over the years. I am glad Nome actually made it decent this time. The food is great. It is on the expensive side but you have the quality. I had the Wara Yaki ($9.5), few pieces of raw salmon seared on the outside and with the aroma of charcoal. it is absolutely delicious. And the 'deep fried pork belly' ($6.5) was really surprisingly good. They had braised the pork belly so it is nicely seasoned and soft, and then it was deep fried after. So it is crunchy on the outside and delicious and soft on the inside. Lovely.  Overall the service is great, the waitress are hot, and it is not overly crowded like Guu. Lovely, and will return again."}
{"text":"Overall, a nice little Izakaya at Yonge and Sheppard. I'd give it a 3.5. It definitely stands out form the rest in the area.  Nice food, nice interior, great service.  The minus point really falls short in the food. Some food is really good, some is just meh, and some you wonder. Ordering the right thing is important i feel. Talk it out with your server."}
{"text":"I don't know why people give 5 stars to such a standard place. Nothing impressed me to give more than 3. Food, environment,waitressing skills, service quickness,etc.."}
{"text":"Food was great.  Service was friendly and fast.  Drinks were perfect.  The only reason I'm giving 4/5 is because even though the food was really good, it was just missing a tiny bit of something that would make it extraordinary.    We had the $1 PEI oysters- small, but $1; the octopus appetizer, the short ribs, the octopus balls, and the eel risotto.  All good, but the risotto was a bit saltier than necessary.    I'd definitely go back"}
{"text":"Went here on a Friday night. I've been here a few times but decided to write a review this time. The food is pretty good but a little on the expensive side for what you get.  Japa burger and spare ribs were tasty. The first couple of times I came here it was pretty packed but not so much this time...which was fine by me.  The service was pretty good. The waiter we had was friendly which is in big contrast to the waitresses we had the last couple of times. The waitresses were so freakn miserable. It seemed like life had beaten them down but the waiter we got this time was pretty cool. The hostess still seemed pretty miserable but our interaction with her was minimal."}
{"text":"The sliders are so good, the sashimi salad is great, most of the options we ordered were good. However the downside of this place is the staff, not friendly and can be a bit rude, and the super long wait time (which explains the food quality) and also it's because there is not much happening in north York. Despite some new places have opened up but Nome was probably the frist cool place for foodies and still a very popular one.  My only bad experience have always been with the staff and the waiters .... some are a bit grumpy and some can be a bit rude or tooooo rushed ! Lol  The place is cool, food is good. Well, for a both York food establishment overall it's good...."}
{"text":"Generally I like this restaurant but the quality varies each visit...today's bun seems coming from dollar store....."}
{"text":"Love this place,,,Oysters are on discount on Tuesdays and Wednesdays...highly recommend that you make reservations beforehand, cause you could be waiting up to an hour to get a spot.  Danbouri - LOVELY !"}
{"text":"This is a regular stomping ground for us. It's always a lively time with live DJ spinning on the weekends. It gets busy here especially on Fridays and weekends, so make sure to grab a reservation.    I always go for the tako wasabi as a starter. If you love raw octopus and wasabi, this is the dish for you. I love the freshness of the octopus and the tangy-ness of the wasabi. The japa-Burgers are also a must. The patties are made of rib eye, so they are mouthwateringly juicy. If you're still hungry, I would recommend the baked oysters or the takoyaki.  Service is always friendly and they usually have sports games on the flatscreens. Always a good time"}
{"text":"Great ambiance, hip restaurant, japanese tapas. Good experience!   unagi risotto, risotto was over cook to mushy rice that u cant feel the texture. 1$ oysters on tuesday. Oden was amazing. Super fresh beef tartar.  Wasabi octopus good starter. So so seabass , under cook ...even flake apart. Tuna tartar has 2oz tuna, wasnt much a fan of it. It did look really pretty.   All in all still a good experience would go back for the rest of the dishes."}
{"text":"I went here for a birthday party, parking was pretty crazy but that didn't matter because parking is always crazy in the 6.  The food was amazingly presented, and not to mention the flavors. I had the spicy chicken, which was super delicious and thank goodness the chicken was cooked to perfection, the meat was succulent. My fiance had the baked oysters which he said were filled with \"yummy goodness\"   The atmosphere was definitely fitting for the birthday party, and even just a night to get together with some friends to drink and eat and be merry :).   overall this place was definitely a hit for me."}
{"text":"This place is by-far one of my favourite spots north of the city. It's a hidden gem I like to keep in my back pocket as a cool alternative for informal occasions. The menu may seem a little daunting if you're unfamiliar with the Izakaya experience but I've slowly made my way through the entirety of it, and have not been disappointed. Some staples include the fried pork belly, the spicy short-ribs, apple salmon, monkfish tacos, Chilean sea bass, and the excellent oyster selection. The atmosphere is pretty cool too. Thursdays-Saturdays have a more upbeat vibe, dim lighting, a DJ and a really vibrant crowd, whereas the rest of the week is a little more subdued. A good option for a more informal social event, whether you have a large party or as a couple. The shared-plate, tapas inspired menu is the perfect alternative that gives you the opportunity to try a little bit of everything. They also have an awesome cocktail menu, beer options, sake selection and wine list for all your beverage endeavours. Skip the pub or wing joint and pop in here next time."}
{"text":"Gem of North York. They have oyster specials on Tuesdays, my friend also told me they have specials on Thursdays as well. We also ordered the California Style Sashimi Donbouri, it was AMAZING. Long story short, this place has become my favourite spot uptown. I will definitely go to North York from downtown just to have the Donbouri."}
{"text":"This was my first time at Nome and my boyfriend's second time. It was a great experience. The atmosphere is hip and trendy with the staff being friendly, attentive and gorgeous! When we first arrived it was PACKED. Not one table was available on a Sunday night which is quite rare. We were offered the bar and we obliged which we normally don't do.   Our bartender was attentive and friendly. The only problem was the food arrived before my first drink. As someone who loves to pair my food with beverage, I waited to eat until I received my drink. However, I recognized she was swamped as she was the only bartender on in a full house.    The food was very flavourful with many different textures. My only complaint would be the Chicken Karrage. It had a very strong wasabi flavour to it. I found it didn't have a balance of acidity to counteract the spicy and creamy elements. I would favour a karrage dish like Kasa Moto's more. The sushi was the best sushi I've had in Toronto however. The Maki was huge and had an amazing combination of crunch, creaminess and a great balance of that fish flavour with a hint of spice and refreshing cucumber.  Overall, the experience was great and we will definetly be back!"}
{"text":"5 stars ~~  I've been to a bunch of tapas bars and nome is easily in my top 3. The service is consistently attentive and the food is always great.  FOOD: 4/5  - TAKOYAKI 5/5   probably the best takoyaki I've had in toronto. It's always hot, crunchy on the outside and warm goodness on the inside -OYSTERS 4/5 ( tues & wed 1$ special)  Pretty fresh for the most part.. but sometimes they're so tiny  OCTO WASABI 4.5/5 only taking .5 off because my friend didn't like the slimeyness of the octopus. But, ugh I love slimy raw octopus and wasabi. ** if you don't like slimy, raw or Wausau don't get this SASHIMI SALAD 3/5 it was good sashimi, but I'm not gonna spend 10 bucks for it again  DRINKS 4/5  - JADE FOX 5/5  I seriously love this shit, this kiwi mojito is heaven. Its not too sweet and not bitter at all  - BERRY MOJITO 4/5 This raspberry and blackberry mojito was a little too sour for me, but my friend loved it so.. 4 stars -CUNNING KIMONO 3/5 this is a lychee martini w/ lychee jelly. It was kinda bitter to me and the lychee flavour wasn't as powerful as I would have liked."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for years!! Recently been coming here often for birthday celebrations and I have a new found love for this place! Good service and good food! Although when you have a bigger group service is a little slow. Must try the unagi risotto with extra parm on top!"}
{"text":"We went here on the recommendation of fellow Yelper extrodinnaire Jackie W. My boyfriend had a gift card from  work and we tried out our luck and boy am I glad we did! The Yelp community does not steer you wrong!!  The location is near yonge and Sheppard and there is plenty of parking both in the lot behind the restaurant and on the street. The location is right on Yonge, beautiful decor with friendly and attentive staff.  We were seated right away and when places are packed on a random Thursday let me tell you, it's a good sign! We got right to ordering, using Yelp suggestions and our growling stomache as our guides. The bulgogi tacos were out of this world delicious, the lobster roll amazing, and the baked oysters were out of this world!!! Basically everything was outstanding including thr dessert and next time we'd probably try the burgers everyone raves about!    Though we had a gift card, the prices are very reasonable and trust me when bf and I eat it's enough for a small army.  We are already planning our next trip...cant wait for the cheat day :)"}
{"text":"We came here two nights ago and both my dad and my friends dad got food poisoned. It's been two days and they're both still feeling pretty sick. The only foods that they had that we didn't was the calamari so I can only assume it's from that.   On top of some of us getting food poisoned, the service at this place was seriously terrible. They forgot one of our orders (steak) and when it arrived (almost an hour later) it was super cold and tasteless. However, after we showed our concern about the steak they didn't charge us in our final bill.  The only reason why I'm giving this place 2 stars instead of 1 is because the times that we've been here before we're okay.  Overall, if you're looking for Japanese bar food, there are plenty of better places (with better food and service) that you can spend your money on. Don't bother here"}
{"text":"Nome is a huge favorite of mine. Make sure to reserve early if you want to go. Japanese burgers are so good. Oysters served fresh. I absolutely love their shrimp udon. It has a Wasabi kicker as a sauce. I absolutely love this place.  Even to order for take out. I never miss ordering the shrimp udon dish. The best!"}
{"text":"Came with one fine woman! It was her first time eating oysters and it went well. The restaurant is rated on the following criteria; cleanliness, atmosphere, customer service and food quality.  We went at 5:15 PM on a Wednesday. The place was empty but it got filled up throughout the night because of the buck a shuck deal. A reservation is a must for this place.  In terms of cleanliness, it was apparent that the place was clean. Neither of us had food poisoning the day after. However, their washrooms were not very clean but it's better than what you'd expect at most Asian restaurants. 1/1 Star  The restaurant was dark and it looked like a hallway with tables lined up on the side. The walls were decorated with lovely Asian painting and bottles of alcohol were displayed on the shelves. We enjoyed the uniqueness and the mood lighting. 1/1 Star  In terms of customers service, we were treated well and attended to graciously until the room began to fill up. It then became apparent that we had to start flagging waitresses down like other Asian restaurants. One of our orders; the ribs, came non-spicy. I'm not sure if that is a mistake on the waitress or the kitchen. 1.5/1.5 Stars  Moving on to the food! We had ten Fanny Bay oysters first, they were big and delicious with the sauces and my girlfriend loved it. I feel like the sauces kind of make the experience here. A dozen Malpeque oysters followed and they had a salty brine with a creamy texture that made it taste better than the Fanny Bay ones. After the raw food, we had wings with hot sauce on the side, spicy rib(which came out not spicy) and chicken karaage. Aside from the rib not being spicy, it all tasted great. 1.5/1.5 Stars"}
{"text":"To be honest! Disappointed! very very mingy portions! Everything tastes salty! I have to drink water from time to time!!!! Nothing is special. I was doubting that the chicken was undercooked. won't come back again,"}
{"text":"This is a trendy Japanese tapas restaurant / lounge on Yonge Street. We actually tried to come here on the weekend, but they were booked, so we just came back on a weeknight. If you want to come, I'd recommend you book a reservation or at least call ahead.  The restaurant has a nicely-decorated interior, with stylish furniture and dim (but not dark) lighting. The music is mostly top 40, so I'll leave it to you if that's a pro or a con. The service was fast and friendly, though the waitresses were a bit underdressed, I felt (though not quite Hooters level). I imagine this place probably gets a bit more rowdy late at night, but we didn't stay to find out.  The food was tasty and had a lot of variety. We got the black sesame edamame (good), the Japa-Burgers (decent), the grilled marinated squid (great), the double salmon sushi roll (great), and the spicy marinated short rib (good). Come with some friends, in order to share, but not too many - most dishes are sized for about 3 people. Overall, I'm not in a rush to come back, but the experience was fun nonetheless."}
{"text":"Quite a trendy and busy place. I was given the boot after 2 hours which I understood. But wish they advised me as they sat me. Not when there's 30 minutes left. When our server told me that after I ordered 36 oysters all I heard was the \"flight of the bumble bee\" ringing in my head. Food was not bad. And service was....  okay I guess. They forgot about us and our requests often. And took us some time to even try to order. Never got follow ups. Or our water. Maybe because t was $1 oyster night...  but imo you never compromise service. I mean not like they had any special food to compensate or fall back in. Pretty normal Asian bar affair. But shout out to those kalbi tacos!  Not too shabby!   If it wasn't for a few of the servers slip ups. They would have gotten a 4.  Don't drink and drive.  Cheers"}
{"text":"BUCK A SHUCK Tuesday's and Wednesday's are a must-go! They offer a larger kind of oysters, 10 for $12 which is a nice change up. The cocktails are great! I love the lychee iced tea and the jade fox (kiwi Mojito).   I would also recommend the udon salad, takoyaki, Japa burger, unagi risotto and the sashimi!   Make a reservation, either call in same day or go online and make one on open table, they are usually flexible and respond within a day. Without a reservation, be prepared to wait at least an hour on weekends."}
{"text":"We really enjoyed this spot!!   Finally made my way to Nomé after hearing so many good things and I was certainly not disappointed!  I made a reservation a week in advance for a Wednesday night so we can enjoy the $1 oysters, and upon arriving was seated promptly. We were notified of the two hour seating limit, which I understood, but I still found it to be a bit off-putting to be told that as soon as I sat down. The hostess was a bit cold but our waitress was really sweet.   We ordered a bunch of oysters, the sliders and the spicy short ribs, everything was really delicious, I can understand why people rave about the food, it's really great. The sliders were hearty and meaty and they had a nice mix of textures, the short ribs were spicy and flavourful, and the oysters were fresh and really beautiful; my favourite part of the experience for sure. I especially loved all the sauces they offered with them.   The restaurant is really cool and hip, it's a small place so space is a bit limited, tables are quite close together, but there are still spots for larger groups. There's an upstairs level as well and I see that they have a patio upstairs as well which I think would be a great place for the warmer months.   The reason for the 4 stars as opposed to 5 were just a few minor details. The first, as previously mentioned, is the seemingly strict time limit. We were out in under an hour or so but the table next to us was starting to get warned that their time was almost up and were given a \"last call\" to order. I just don't find that conducive to a relaxing dining atmosphere. I guess for their special oyster nights, they want people in and out but I still think it's a strange thing to do to customers. The second thing I found odd was that they offered sparkling or flat water, flat water for $3 which gives you unlimited refills. We asked for tap water which was free but it wasn't offered as a choice so maybe unknowing people might not know that it's an option. They said that they have a special water filtration system which is why they charge for it. Seems like a weird money-grab to me.   Otherwise I'd love to come back with a group of friends, it's a fun place with great food and a cool atmosphere. It can definitely get pricey if you're ordering drinks and lots of food, I'd say have dinner beforehand, and then come here for oysters, snacks and drinks!"}
{"text":"Small place to hang out with friends. It's definitely very crowded. Small dishes and taste good, not great tho."}
{"text":"It's a Tuesday night and my friends decided to bring me out to to Nome since I've never had oysters before. To start off I really like that it's very close to other restaurants cause next time they suggest Nome I'll make sure to walk towards Owl of Minerva. If there's anything other bad food that I dislike, it's late or rude service. In this case it's BOTH. I don't think in any case having to ask for water twice is acceptable, nor is being obnoxious towards your customers. Owl of Minerva on Yonge during rush hour gave me my food faster.   Other than that, the $1 oyster deal was alright. The atmosphere of Nome is nice, their Japa-burger was better than the oysters but the deep fried pork belly saved my night, which is why this review is at a measly 3/5."}
{"text":"OK. This place is awesome. The food, the vibe, the music.. Oh and the drinks, the drinks! The lychee martini is honestly to die for.  We went on a Wednesday for Buck-a-shuck oysters; the Fannys were awesome. And the Jappa sliders are all that!   The wait staff are super personable and really attractive! On top of all of this, this spot plays some dope old school hip hop to wash it all down.  To say I will be going back is an understatement, I might move in."}
{"text":"This place is great! We've gone multiple times for intimate dinners with our friends. A great Izakaya experience. My only complaint is that the serving sizes are a bit too small for their prices. I know that is what to expect in Izakaya but this is Izakaya fusion. I'd expect a bit more gluttony for the price. All in all I would still recommend it."}
{"text":"This Izakaya style restaurant (think tapas go Japanese) certainly hits the right notes for what it is. Servings are smallish, but the idea is to order a variety. The yam fries and calamari were good but nothing special. The pork belly and marinated short ribs are house specialties and excellent. A standout was the Oden soup, a very unusual mild broth with assorted small fish cakes in interesting shapes. That alone could make a lunch. We came on the basis of positive Yelp and other reviews and were not disappointed. It's a good value too. I'll be back for a buck-a-shuck oyster night.  If you go be forewarned that it can be crowded (make a reservation), and partly as a result of that, it can be loud! We had difficulty hearing each other across the table, hardly something you expect in a Japanese restaurant. The large wood ceiling panels likely aggravate the noise problem, since those make effective sound reflectors."}
{"text":"First time trying Nome after loving other izakaya places. All the foods I've gotten here were really good. Walking in to this place, there was a rustic vibe with nice dim lighting and Asian decor.  All the staff were friendly and checked up on us often to see if we needed anything else.   We got a variety of items: lychee iced tea, beef tartare, baked oysters, takoyaki, japa burgers, monkfish tacos, and chicken poppers (karage) for two people. Everything was tasty and the portions were great!   It was on the pricier end but that was expected for an izakaya place. I would definitely recommend this place if you're craving some Japanese style foods!"}
{"text":"This is a great Izakaya restaurant without the noise of similar Izakaya joints. The food here is great and the service is excellent, but the menu could use a few more vegetarian dishes...The ambiance here is excellent, nice modern setting with light top 40 music in the background, this is a great place to have some snacks, a light dinner and drinks, perfect place for those who want to talk."}
{"text":"Came here one night with some friends to take advantage of their $1 oyster special. Service was awful. We were told there were no tables available despite the whole place being nearly empty. We were also informed that our server was too busy to serve us..uhmm what!? The food was very disappointing, to put it mildly. The kalbi ribs were very fatty, barely any meat on the ribs. Foodwise, compared to other izakayas, Nome falls short. The karage was unflavored, the flavored mayo dipping sauce was just green mayo. The tuna tataki was good though. Guu and Yuzu do a MUCH better job."}
{"text":"Neat and trendy place. A good alternative instead of going somewhere downtown if you live in the area.  We were unfortunately seated next to an ahem rowdy Asian family during our first visit here so the atmosphere wasn't exactly what I had hoped for. However, the food made up for it.  Sashimi was fresh and presentation for all the dishes were really nice. I'm a fan of sweet potato fries and the ones here weren't bad, though I wouldn't say it's 'the dish' to order. The deep fried oyster tempuras were crunchy on the outside, and nice and fresh on the inside. The sauce also went pretty nice with it. Something to try here.  They do have a pretty vast menu so I'd actually suggest trying something to your interest here, not to mention their dishes are quite unique compared with other izakayas out there so definitely worth a visit."}
{"text":"I was pleased with my first visit to Nome, but after the second, I was already bored of the menu. I also felt that majority of the items on the menu were deep fried with only a few salads to refresh the palate.   I would only come back here for drinks and their $1-2 oyster special on Tues & Wed."}
{"text":"Dollar oysters with sauces, excellent starters. The Japa burgers was one pf the best tasting \"burgers\" I've had. The smoky BBQ sauce had the perfect balance of smoke and other ingredients. We will be back. Great place to share food and conversation, although the conversation was a bit loud but then it's an Izakaya!"}
{"text":"I came for the $1 oysters (Tues and Wed) but stayed for...everything else. The food is delicious and well-portioned compared to other Izakaya establishments in Toronto and the staff are helpful without being annoying and disruptive (warning - there is a 2 hr seating time and reservation is recommended). For food, I recommend the black cod, creamy mentai and potato crisp and tiger shrimp (Ebi-Mayo). Their famous sliders are good, too, but it's too much bun for this hun (the sauce is definitely the star). And for the cocktail drinks, I liked the berry mojito. It's not for mojito-traditionalists but it's refreshing after an hour or 2 of gorging."}
{"text":"$1 oyster Wednesday. That should probably be my shortest review yet. What more do you need?  Tasty cocktail and beer and sake? You've got it. Superb finger foods that are great to share with friends? You've got it. Close to the subway and not ridiculously overpriced? You've got it. Oh, and did I mention $1 oyster Wednesdays? What are you waiting for? I'm out the door already."}
{"text":"Excellent place, parking in the back, nice environment, really professional service, the  Oysters are very fresh  and not expensive at all. Their Japa burgers are so tasty as well as their tiger shrimp. In terms of sushi the double tuna (I this it's called )  is quite good too. I've been there at least 7 times and I'll definitely go there again I've and over"}
{"text":"Our go to spot for oysters and after work drinks! Can't beat the $1 buck a shucks on the weekdays.   The ambiance is great in the evenings for drinks and tapas with a group of friends. The majority of times I've been here were for birthdays. All of the food items that I've tried have been amazing. The usual crowd pleaser; sliders, ebi mayo, sweet potato fries (of course), short ribs, poor belly, carage - just to name a few.  Last I heard they were expanding a rooftop patio. Not too sure if that's been open, but that should be interesting!"}
{"text":"Yummmm.  Nomé wasn't packed as I came with my friends on a Tuesday around 8PM.  The servers are knowledgable and very sweet but disappears around the end of the meal.  Nomé  The sangria was delicious here; bubbly and sweet.  I got the Cali Style Sashimi Donburi and it was eff'ing delicious.  It filled me right up and I cannot, cannot, cannot wait to go back.    Overall, Nomé is has more a Japanese-bar like feel.  The sushi, sashimi, and rolls are actually a little more expensive than I'm used to and decided against ordering a roll in favour of going to Bake Code after.  I'll def be back for buck-a-shuck next week!  PS. I think they have a spot or 2 for parking in the back - but other than that, parking can be a struggle, just park where the TTC station is and pay."}
{"text":"NOMe NOMe NOMe.   Tuesday night $1 oysters are a thing to die for! My friend has been raving about this place for some time so I made a reservation for Tuesday dinner for my mom's birthday.   We arrived half an hour early but were seated promptly. The 2 hour seating limit didn't start until the actual time of our reservation so I thought that was very nice.   I ordered a Sapporo and there's nothing quite like having it on tap. We ordered 45 oysters throughout the night, japa-burgers, the lobster roll, unagi risotto, and the takoyaki. Despite our frequent orders, the service was very quick and attentive.   The oysters come with a number of different toppings you can add to it. This roulette of toppings really sets it apart from some of the other oyster joints in the area. The taste and size if the oysters were average to above average, but for $1 I was more than happy.   The japa-burgers are something to rave about. They come in triplets and are delicious. My brother's description of them were \"Big Mac's super elite older brother\" but I don't think that does it justice.   The lobster roll was large and quite good. I couldn't really taste the lobster though tbh.   The unagi risotto comes out warm and in a very small bowl. There is one piece that tastes fantastic, but leaves you craving more. It was not very filling and despite being unique, was the least memorable dish we ordered.   The takoyaki was one of the best that I've eaten. I attribute this to the fact that not one flavour overpowered another and blended well for a delicious takoyaki.   All in all, fantastic place! I only rated it 4.5 stars because it is pretty pricy and eating here is a little inconvenient. Despite ordering and spending a lot, I left the restaurant not quite full yet. Regardless, this is a must go!"}
{"text":"My favourite place!! Especially on the days where we can suck for a buck! Service is decent... But food is great! The sashimi salad is to die for. The japa burgers are OK..  Kind of sweet; which I don't really like. Oysters are good and juicy. Lovin the takoyaki balls.. The only thing you should be aware of is that you should rsvp a table for your party a head of time otherwise wait time can be a little crucial. Environment is great, can be loud. Been here about 6 times, and also had my birthday dinner celebration here. Parking you gotta pay for. I highly recommend Nome."}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere there. It's actually a good place for a Saturday chill out. A great great place to have oysters. Really fresh although not a lot of different kinds"}
{"text":"One word-Super Wow. Okay that's two words. My partner in crime suggested this place as we were on a  waiting list for another resto nearby. Great Choice!!!Nice place nestled in the hipster part of Yonge Street. If you like Tapa restaurants @affordable prices $$-$$$$. We ordered the crowd favorites. Burger sliders, Tiger shrimp, BBQ spicy chicken and sashimi with smoothies of piña colada and peach mango. The Good: we had great service! Our waitress gave us the run down of the best choices. The atmosphere is great with hip music for Friday and Saturday dinners. They also have big TV screens to watch sports. The bad: need to make reservations on busy nights otherwise the wait to get a table is at least 1hour. The Ugly-not a place you want to take some one on a first date can't really hear each other unless you're seated at the bar. It's like a mini club, but that's a minor nusense. Tips: Oh yeah get their Honey bread dessert. Also if they offer the bar because you need to wait for a table, take it..it ain't bad. You can watch them make the rolls and shasimi. Save time..."}
{"text":"Good for some drinks with friends or grab some oysters on tues/wed. Other food is just so so but the japaburgers are good. Service can be slow at times and mix ups happens so just check in with them. Good drink options: sangria, oyster bay wine, alosake, yogurt sake, sake bombs. Their rooftop patio is nice with overhanging lights. Music downstairs can be a little loud.   Yes would visit here again.  Wish they would change the food menus from time to time."}
{"text":"First time going here with some friends.  Service was terrible!!!! Tried several dishes.  Tried 4 types of oysters (fanny bay, kusshi, French kiss & malpeque) & they were all delicious.  Mentai potato chips with cod fish egg dip were just ok. The dip was nothing special. Marinated Beef short rib- delicious  Lobster rolls- good Bulgogi Tacos- just ok Tuna sashimi salad - good Tuna tango- just ok Corn on cob deep fried was delicious"}
{"text":"Honestly there's no point in even trying to get a table here. Every time I come it's an hour to 2 hours wait time and you see empty tables everywhere. Even asking the hostess how long the wait might be will take you 20 minutes. The hostesses are so slow you almost wonder what's so hard about pressing a few buttons on a screen to check tables. Honestly the food is average and drinks aren't anything special and the prices aren't even great. The only thing that's good about this place is their Tuesday and Wednesday buck-a-shuck deal. But good luck trying to find a table on those days. They're only so packed cause of the location, so if you are coming, make sure you want to wait an hour or 2 or wait 20 minutes to check how long the wait for a table will be before you pay for parking."}
{"text":"I've been to this place quite a few times. What attracted me was the $1 oyster days.  Obviously, this is an izakaya. If you're a big eater and you're expecting to eat till you're full. Expect to spend a lot of money.  Anyways onto the food. Some things I personally like are the japaburgers. 3 japanese styles sliders. Shrimp udon salad is pretty good if you can handle the taste of wasabi. In fact, all 3 salad options are pretty good. The oysters you get on the $1 days are the malpeque. I'm also a big fan of the yam fries, lobster fantasy. One of my friends really likes the unagi risotto.  Red wine sake sangria is really good. As is the aloe soju, and yogurt soju. These are definitely must tries in my opinion..  The place is small and dark. The darkness is kinda good though because you feel more separated from neighboring tables in such a small establishment. Wait times can be long so i suggest that you make a reservation before going.  Service is usually really good and waitresses are gorgeous. Top notch women."}
{"text":"What pushed me to try out this restaurant were friends who have been to Nomé and always had nothing but good things to say. That being said, I took a chance and decided to celebrate my 21st birthday here. My reservation was made for Saturday March 12 with a group of 15 at 9pm.   When we arrived, we were seated right away and around 9:30pm the place was filled with only a couple of seats available left at the bar. The place is quite small and very popular so I strongly suggest making reservations if you plan on coming. Many of the dishes on the menu are made for sharing which was perfect for my group. Every dish we tried.. None of them disappointed us! A lot of the food paired really well with the drinks they offered on the menu and the server always attended to our table to see how we were doing.  Later around 11pm, the atmosphere changed as they turned up the music. (Saturday's are live DJ nights). They played good music.. Music you would typically hear at clubs. And just before leaving the restaurant, the servers came out and surprised me with a complimentary cheesecake and a large sparkler! Thank you to the staffs at Nomé and my friends who made my birthday special.  All I can say is that I definitely 100% would come back and recommend this place for everyone to try out."}
{"text":"Unlike most of the other Japanese restaurants in Toronto opened by non-Japanese people but only hire Japanese staff, Nome Izakaya hires young and trendy girls who speak Canadian and look plenty appetizing in its dim lighting. But most people aren't here because of the girls (unlike the suits bars downtown), but for the $1 oysters and/or the yummy food.   Also unlike Kinka (formerly known has guu), this place does not have japanese chefs yelling hello and goodbye to you as you come in and out of the door, which reduces the noise level significantly.  I came here twice in the few weeks I was in toronto this holiday season and was satisfied with the majority of the food here: Inexpensive and well portioned for an Izakaya.  It is then, of no surprise, that not all the food here is Japanese, or even Japanese fusion, and has quite a bit of korean flavours  I would order again: - sesame salmon - came with avocado, which the second time i went the server said does not. was so good though that i would keep ordering it every time i come here - Maguro & Avocado Tartare - Kinda like a poke but more garlicky! Ordered this twice! - Nagasaki Chanpon - we had spicy with added udon noodles. The soup was so good and had three portions of every seafood which was great! would order again! - baked oysters - with broccoli cream cheese - delish!! would order again! - unagi risotto - good but a bit too cheesy  I wouldn't say no if someone wanted: - bulgogi tacos: three in the dish - quite good but not crazy about the mayo - spicy marinated beef short ribs - really good and actually has a good kick, but seems pretty typically korean flavoured kalbi - habanero chicken - really spicy and a bit too salty, but really tasty - japanese chicken poppers (kara-age): upon first bite was boring, after a few more bites, pretty good  I would definitely avoid: - grilled beef tongue - dry and doesn't taste that fresh   For drinks, I tried these: - blue samurai - a type of pineapple malibu thats less tangy - really good - sake red sangria - also very good  The portions here are quite decent so i would say that you only need 2 to 3 dishes a person at most, so you'd be spending between 30 to 40 dollars depending on if you drink.  The food is not as great as Kinka, but I definitely prefer the atmosphere here."}
{"text":"I love oysters and got my boyfriend into them too, and we come here every week now on their $1 oyster nights. It's always a good time and the food is great. Wait times get longer later on in the night."}
{"text":"Came back one more time and once again we got shoddy service.. again we had things forgotten from our order. Also we tried the oysters on special (i think it was tuesday) and they were nasty, don't bother."}
{"text":"Had a last minute craving for oysters and luckily for us, it was a Wednesday so $1 oysters was the going special.  Called the place to book for reservations and they were able to fit us two in for 10pm.  Got there on time and was seated after a 5 minute wait or so.  The place was packed and had a very chilling ambient feeling which was great.  Highly recommend this place for first dates.  We immediately ordered and decided to go with 2 dozen of the malpeque oysters, grilled squid, and a sashimi garden salad.  The grilled squid tasted a bit too soft for my liking and was a bit under seasoned.  The sashimi garden salad on the other hand was great!  It tasted fresh and the mayo sauce was a perfect touch to the salad.  Now on to the main event which were the oysters.  They came beautifully shucked and tasted very fresh.  Tried all their various sauces which greatly enhanced the taste!  All in all, it was a very pleasurable experience and we are already planning to go back next week to eat more oysters and to try other items off their menu.  If you are an oyster fanatic like we are and are in the North York location, definitely try this place out!"}
{"text":"First time here. Googled reviews. No reservations. Got lucky and were seated by the bar. Our Caucasian server with glasses/brown hair was by far the best.   My husband and I were so pleased with this place. The oysters and food were very good. The owner came by to chat with us and told him that he definitely got it right with this place. Even the music was awesome. It was practically my play list."}
{"text":"Here we go again...Motown Philly Boys 2 Men. Why, I ask. WHY? Is there really no other music you can find? Very perplexed by this. I bet I can guess what's coming up next. Prince. Yep."}
{"text":"The $1 oysters got to me and I have never had raw oysters before so this was new for me. We were lucky enough to find a table during the nighttime on a Tuesday. I love sashimi so the oysters was quite equally as good. Food took a bit to come out but it was worth it! Besides that, I tried the kalbi burgers - crazy good stuff!!!! I thought the risotto was okay, not a big fan of them in general."}
{"text":"I gave this place a few more tries and yesterday would definitely be my last visit. I cannot say that I have left this place ONCE with a positive experience. The best thing about this place I must say are their $1 Malpeque oysters on Tuesdays and Wedesdays. Besides from that, there isn't anything special here. The food is pretty mediocre; nothing special.  The ambiance is very uncomfortable mainly due to the people there. Every time you get up from your seat to go the washroom or just to walk to your table, EVERYONE looks at you and stares you down until you are seated or out of their sight. The crowd is snobby judging by the conversations I have heard in the ladies room and the demeanor the manager displays.  We knew the manager since we have visited a few times. We always make reservations before arrival and one day they told us there weren't any reservation made under us. So, the manager told us that he will TRY to do something for us. He stood beside the hostess and started chatting. We decided to leave since the wait seemed long, so my friend went up to the manager to notify him that we no longer need a table. The manager then tells him that a table's ready for us.  This manner is unacceptable as a manager. The manager should have came up to us to notify us that a table was ready instead of having a full-on conversation with the hostess. If my friend didn't walk up to him for the notification, we would still have  been waiting. Last thing I have to mention about the manager is that, he does not greet us unless we greet him first. This is unexceptional clientele manner as a manager!  Moreover, service is very poor. Nobody came to check up on us or took our plates away and we had to ask more than once about our orders (e.g. when they're arriving and who it's under since we always request for separate bills due to having a large crowd). It's loud with all the chattering and music blasting in the background. It is impossible to have a conversation without yelling at each other.   I really do not recommend this place... unless you are a really tolerable person."}
{"text":"Such an exciting new addition to the Yonge and Sheppard area. We were wooed in by their $1 oyster special. Oysters seemed very fresh and came with a number of condiments. The  white wine vinegar and oyster was a superb combination. Note to self: vinegar goes much better with oyster than lemon juice!   I had the Shrimp Udon Salad, wasn't particularly amazing but I really liked the wasabi dressing. I also tried the self-proclaimed \"Toronto's BEST\" short rib, and in my opinion, it barely fell short of claiming the honors."}
{"text":"Id hate to be the dude working here on tuesday plucking oysters at $1 a pop. we usually come in a group of 10-15 so he's doing close to 50-60 just for us...  good drinking atmosphere and friendly service. this place can get pretty pack and its a tight squeeze near the back of the restaurant. the tapas are pretty good the japaburgers are popular and so are the deep fried shrimp. they should prob change up the calamari and i would also recommend puting sochu whiskey on the menu. every good Izakaya would have it. this place is a good addition to the popular soju joints in the neighbourhood  5/5 for the lovely waitresses"}
{"text":"Food and atmosphere is always outstanding! Don't order the Sangria, unless you're craving OJ, bcuz that's all you will taste - no fruits, no wine."}
{"text":"This is my first visit thanks to dkLO recommendation. The food was fantastic, tasted great and of great variety."}
{"text":"Was in the area so I met up with a friend here last night. Parking was fine, you can park right behind the restaurant. It was $7 to park here which I thought was too much for parking uptown. We made reservations but it wasn't that busy when we arrived.   There were so many things I wanted to try! We ended up ordering the sashimi salad, takoyaki, tiger shrimp, baked oysters, and a seafood soup. We also ordered the japa burgers but they were sold out :( It was only 6:30 so I don't understand how they could be sold out already. The waitress was really nice and attentive and helped us pick something else though.   I thought everything was pretty good, some of it was a little salty but it might have been just me because my friend didn't think so. The takoyaki was actually quite good so I was really happy with that. Overall it was okay for an izakaya in the area, I would come again because I really want to try the japa burger!"}
{"text":"You need to make reservations because its busy! My favorites are Japa burgers (comes in 3) and the fish tacos  (comes in 3). The yam fries are good too as it is served with a great dip."}
{"text":"Food is slightly over priced for those are coming for the first time.  Me,  Im foody so I don't mind spending money on satisfying my taste bud.  I love the Asian fusion food an I gotta give props to the chefs here for being innovative.  The girls here are at least a 7/10, so good news for you boys out there!  I see you yelpers here!"}
{"text":"3.5 Star  Nome Izakaya is a fun place to have a drink or 2 or 3 with friends. Dark and loud and rowdy! Good looking waitress in tight short skirts?   All I care about is the $1 oysters which available Tuesday and Wednesday evening.   Asahi Pitcher ($24.80)  Malpeque Oysters Special ($1 each) - Star Fanny Bay ($12/10) - Star Takoyaki ($5.50) - Not Bad Spicy Short Ribs ($10.30) - A-OK  Food did take awhile to arrive especially the cooked food as the place was busy on a Tuesday evening!  Nome Izakaya is a good watering hole in the area.   I will be back for more oysters!"}
{"text":"Was there for oyster night with a friend from the UK. It was our first visit and having been to Japan a few times I found this spot very authentic. Great energy, attractive staff and customers. Added a lobster roll to our oysters and Asahi Dry. Will be going back again for sure."}
{"text":"Went last night with family for dinner. Oysters were fresh  and everything we ordered on he menu did not disappoint.  This one is a keeper."}
{"text":"Short & Sweet Review - Come here for the Atmosphere and drinking - Asahi beer tasted great and so did the Sapporo. DJ playing and great decor.   With that said, none of the staff are Japanese, but again, this is at the start of Koreatown north so what else would you expect? Therefore, a lot of the food tends to be more fusion-like and not the real deal. Still tastes good, but don't go around espousing to your friends that you now know what \"real\" Japanese food tastes like after visiting Nome!"}
{"text":"I have been here for couple times mostly night late for drinks and snacks here and there. Considering the atmosphere, this is a place to host birthday dinners with your friends and family."}
{"text":"I went there today to try to order the baked oysters to get it take out. The restaurant did not offer it and wants you to eat it dine in only. Thier reason is that they want you to eat it fresh and its to hot for the containers. They offer take out for other items that are even hotter than the baked oysters. So I did take a seat and eat it there in the end and when i got the dish. The baked oysters was so small inside and seems like it was shredded up. I also sat at the bar and no one bought me a glass of water which is pretty much mandatory when you eat in. I would not recommend this place if your looking to order take out and the service is not really good once you disagree about something with them. I will not return to this place again."}
{"text":"Decided to go here for dinner after a recommendation from a friend and then reading all the Yelp reviews and I can happily say that we were not disappointed. Arrived at 6pm on a Tuesday for the $1 oyster night (I highly recommend you make a reservation on Tuesday, Wednesday and weekends) and although we had to wait a little for our table it wasn't bad. Our waitress was friendly and we never had to wait long for her to take our order or clear something away. The drink orders did take quite a while but given how busy they are, it's understandable.   Lobster fantasy - steep at $18 but you get a lot of rolls and they're big so the money is worth it.   Tuna coin - amazing! My husband hates cucumber on anything but he still ate 4 of these and would have happily had more.   Deep fried pork belly - decent, sauce was good but nothing ground breaking.   Monkfish tacos - probably my least favourite of al the dishes. The fish felt lost and over cooked but the tartar sauce was good.   Japaburgers - loved these. A new take on an old classic and I could not have been happier.   Fried octopus balls - it was definitely interesting and new, the texture was kind of weird but the taste was good.   The cocktails were okay-ish, took a while and they were quite sweet and also not very strong. I had 3 in an hour and felt nothing so they could do with a little more of a kick. For dessert we had the honey toast, it was something we had never heard of so have it a try and I'm very glad we did. It was nowhere as sweet as i expected, well balanced and light. We also got the fanny bat oysters ($1 for one type (can't remember the name) and $12 for 10 of the fanny bays) and they were huge! Would definitely come back here again."}
{"text":"Nome Izakaya has $1 oysters on Tuesday. We came when the malpeque had the offer. They were small and decent. Their dishes are very delicious and they have a wide arrange of different tapas. Dishes have an average price range $10+. My favourite was the Japa burger and Aburi salmon donburi, I love torched pressed sushi and it was like a bunch of them all in one bowl. It's good to come in big groups so you get to try a little bit of everything. Service is really fast and they are very responsive!! I suggest making a reservation before you come - it gets really packed!  remember that if you come in a large group they automatically add tip to your bill, but it won't say on your bill. I wasn't notified prior and my bill did not have TIPS or anything indicating tips, it just had food and taxes. I proceeded to give another 15% on top of my bill (which was expensive already), the waiter saw it and didn't even hesitate to tell me."}
{"text":"Wow. I have never been to a tapas place quite like this one! EVERYTHING I had was delicious and if I lived in Toronto, it would definitely be a regular spot for me. I'm from the states and my cousins took me out to this place. The vibe is very chill and it was definitely a cool spot for us to have dinner and take our time enjoying our food. A few menu items that I absolutely loved: tiger shrimp, lobster fantasy, japa burgers, baked oysters, salmon donburi, unagi risotto, the sashimi garden salad, and the bulgogi tacos. All so flavorful and different! Don't think there is really anything like this in Boston (if so, please enlighten me because I NEED to get my hands on this deliciousness again!) We had a table of 12 and order three of each menu item and we were stuffed. For the dessert we got the honey bread and it was devoured in seconds! If you're looking for a local spot or just visiting Toronto, please do yourself a favor and spot by this gem! (I was so hungry that I didn't take any pictures, but pretty much all I mentioned are pictured here!)"}
{"text":"First time coming here with good friends for my birthday dinner.  I am a big fan of Izakaya/tapas and my fav spot was Guu, however I find that place is way too loud!   Kingyo Izakaya was way over priced and potion of food was small, walking out $200 bill and still hungry!  Other hand, Nome has quite good selection of foods with different varieties, their size were big and price was surprisedly cheap!  Decor was inviting with nice ambient, service was little slow that waitress kept forgetting stuffs.. But otherwise I like this place and will definitely coming back :)"}
{"text":"Located at Yonge and Sheppard, this is a great place to hang for food and drinks on a weekday or weekend night, as it's pretty happening (I would assume more so on a weekend). Just to be sure I'd make a reservation before going since it can get packed. On Tuesday's and Wednesday's Nomé has what they call buck-a-shuck i.e. Dollar oysters (Malpeque, PEI variety).  Parking is in the back and paid $2/half hour, $8 nightly max. After 6pm (GreenP lot 403). If you're lucky you may find street parking.   My go-to is usually the sashimi platter, the sliders, or the oysters.  Grab a pitcher of Asahi and enjoy. If you're daring and can handle your liquor, try the Flaming Lambo"}
{"text":"This place was packed when I went! Definitely would recommend a reservation prior to coming here on Tuesdays & Wednesday's + weekends. It'll allow you to avoid any waiting.  The waiters are quick to the punch and are very nice went ordering and explaining the oyster menus.  Got the bulgogi tacos, sliders, yam fries, chicken wings and 10 oysters for $1.  Couldn't really complain about any of the food as it was awesome. The total came out to be around $60 for everything which is not bad at all!!  Everything was seasoned beautifully and tasted beautifully.  Would highly recommend anyone to try out this amazing restaurant at least one time; you won't be disappointed! :)"}
{"text":"Been here several times. Highly recommended. Great place for a night out. Try their yoghurt soju! Designated for girls:) also try the fried pork belly,  fresh oysters , black cod, tiger shrimp they were great and well presented.Staff were very attending and friendly."}
{"text":"Nome Izakaya is a decent choice for tapas and a lively vibe. I've been here twice.  What I liked: - Fanny Bay Oysters - Japa Burger - Bulgogi Tacos  - Monk Fish Tacos - Lobster Roll - Wara Yaki  What I didn't like: - Their sashimi; this was horrible and tasted very watery - Sesame salmon; small pieces and drizzled with sesame oil... - Unagi Risotto; so small and mushy, fairly bland - Sashimi Salad; salad drowned in dressing - Baked Oysters - these were ok but kinka is way better  Overall this place is expensive and not really worth it. I would come back for some of the chef's suggestions and oysters, but not much else."}
{"text":"This review is a bit dated as I came here months ago.   Great food but a bit on the pricey side. A great place for groups especially on their oyster days. My only gripe is when we came here with a reservation we waited 30 min for a table while they gave out all the open tables away to their friends first. If they had told us they don't take reservations or accommodated us in some little way it would've been better.  I doubt we'll be back any time soon."}
{"text":"Honestly, I'm not expecting too much with any japanese restaurant in Toronto. I'm satisfied in Japango as my go-to japanese restaurant. But this place changed my mind set! We were supposed to just grab something around yorkville but we ended up at north york. We saw this Nome sushi as top 3 in my yelp current location. I usually go for the 3-5 spot. So, we came in without any reservation and they still accommodated us in the bar. We start it off with the famous oysters!! And good lord, not even kidding, it's a good one. I'm actually coming back to try the $1 oyster during tuesdays. Then we thought of getting japa burgers, short ribs, and unagi rissotto. I'm not so impressed with the rissoto, it's sticky japanese rice with shredded nor with eel and unagi sauce. It's decent. For the short ribs, i feel like it was dry but my companion who has more experience and exposed to recipes said it's fine. We like the sauce by the way. And lastly the japa burgers!! If only im not full, i would buy another order."}
{"text":"1 dollar oysters and cool lounge . Lots of beautiful people and every thing tasted delicious. Definitely worth another visit"}
{"text":"I genuinely love all the dishes I've had here. They include items such as the following:   -Baked Oysters ($12.50) which included 4 oysters that were deliciously baked in a creamy spinach sauce -Unagi Risotto ($9.80) this was creamier than I expected but in a great way -Monkfish Tacos ($14.80) which included 3 tacos with crispy, deep fried pieces of fish  -Aburi Salmon Donburi ($12.80) this was the 'cleanest' item we ate all night as everything else felt heavy in comparison. This was amazing as well!   We ended dinner with one of their specialty desserts, Cheesecake Ice Cream ($8.80). In all honesty, even though it tasted good, I wouldn't say it was worth the money for this specific dessert dish. It was basically just ice cream that was cheesecake flavored. If that's your thing though, definitely order it!   All in all, a great experience as usual. The only reason it's not 5/5 stars is because of how close each table is to another. Anytime I was speaking to my boyfriend, I felt as though the table next to mine was also invited to participate in what we were discussing due to the proximity of the seats...."}
{"text":"WHAT TO TRY?!  Anything on their grilled menu is generally pretty good. I especially liked the marinated short rib. The baked oysters were good too in flavor but I would want to taste bigger chunks of oysters rather than chopped up and mixed with the cream and cheese.   From the fried menu I tried the takoyaki and the calamari. They were both good and the takoyaki has 6 balls per order! Calamari was a bit over fried but the Japanese tartar was pretty unique.   From the chefs selection, the wara yaki was good! Slightly seared and then smoked in house. Pretty unique dish I haven't tried elsewhere! I would recommend you to try. The japa burgers are good because they used the short rib meat and its marination as the base of the patty. We also tried the Mac and cheese but didn't think it was that special. I thought I was eating nachos because of the ingredients it came with but instead of nachos served with cheese and peppers, it was macaroni!! The texture of the macaroni was good though!  It's generally VERY busy here. We went on a Monday and it was still very busy up until we left which was 11:20 pm. It's awesome they open till 2am everyday though. Especially when you're craving Japanese tapas on a regular day, you can rely on Nomé to be open late to satisfy your crave.   Last tip??  Come here on Tuesdays or Wednesdays to take advantage of the $1 oysters deal!!! Don't forget they have a special menu too that showcase some of their seasonal items which might interest you! And make reservations because this place is busyyy!"}
{"text":"overpriced and super small portion sizes which felt more like appetizers and did not fill us up. The funny thing was that the server told us that the dishes were meant to be shared. Wouldn't go back there"}
{"text":"Tried their japa burger and their yam fries and the yam fries were very good but the japa burger was slightly over dressed. Overall was good. Still enjoying the atmosphere and people here."}
{"text":"Their Instagram says \"$1 oysters Tuesday's and Wednesdays all night long\" so I went in on Wednesday and somehow 22 oysters came out to $42.50. The waitress gave some spiel about how each type of oyster is only X dollar amount off. Long story short, false advertising. (Only the Malpeque oysters are $1) Besides that, their Bulogi tacos are the best tacos that have ever entered my mouth, complete flavour explosion. Their sesame salmon and short ribs were nothing special, overall a classy restaurant perfect for a date."}
{"text":"Really nice izakaya place at North York. Came here for my friends bday celebration and they did not dissapoint at all. We ordered a lot off their menu, including the oysters and were amazed by 95% of the stuff (I would skip the sashimi and something on the menu along the lines of coin sushi).  This was my first oyster experience and I really enjoyed it! No weird smell, tasted fresh too! I would definitely come back to take advantage of their cheap oyster days, but I was still pleased with the regular prices too! I wish they had a sample platter arrangment for all the oysters they have to offer though, that would've been nice.  The burger and tacos were amazing. We had a group of 4, and the food only came as a set of 3, so we had an option to add an additional one which I highly recommend.  We were very pleased with the overall service as they kept refilling our tea for us on the icy day we went.  They even came out with 2 slices of cheesecake factory cheesecake for the birthday celebrations for free! Considering the lines at Yorkdale are still massively long, it was nice to be able to try the cheesecake and not need to be in that line!"}
{"text":"Nomé Izakaya is another new Izakaya () that open up in Toronto a few months ago and I went there back in September (yes I am that behind on my posts) since it was recommended by a friend. Upon entering the place, it was rather empty and I was a bit skeptical with the \"club-wear\" clad waitresses but the good thing is, they all speak English fluently unlike most Japanese Restaurants but at the same time they weren't very knowledgeable of the menu... then I realize that the Chefs are Korean rather than Japanese *more skeptical  Nothing special, the usual decor of Japanese Restaurant these days but I have to say, I love the black plates with the wooden tables.  On the house, a half shll oyster for each of us as an amuse bouche.  Nigori Sake $19  Pickled Fire Fly Squid  $4.30 ~ Hotaru Ika No Okizuke: Pickled fire fly squid with soy sauce. ~ Not sure what this was when we order it but was giving it a try notherless given it's so cheap. It was very salty and fishy tasting and we both didn't really like this dish, oh well at least we tried.    The Mack-Attack $9.80 ~ Aburi Shime Saba : Lightly seared makarel w/ ground ginger, green onion & soy sauce ~Ben loves loves makarel, so it's a must try everytime we at a Japanese restaurant. The skin here was really well seared and was very crispy while the makarel was not too sour/tart from the marinate.   Deep Fried Pork Belly $5.50 ~ Deep Fried marinated pork belly w/ seaweed paste ~ This was a tad plain looking but the pork belly was melt in your mouth with just a thin layer of batter for a great contrast of texture and just a pop of flavor from the seaweed paste.   Korean Style Beef Sashimi $8.70 ~ Thinly Sliced beef sashimi and fresh egg yolk w/ a korean style soy sauce dressing ~ I love the flavor here especially mixed with the egg yolk and the Korean Pear but hate to say that there was some tendon/vein of the beef which made it chewy at times.   Marinated Black Cod $9.80 ~ Gindara No Yuan Yaki : Black Cod marinated w/ citrus soy sauce ~This was cook perfectly but I find it too salty which overpowered the cod which had a rather mild taste.   Smoked Pork Feet $9.30 ~ Braised and smoked homemade pork feet ~We both like this dish, love the smoky flavor and the sauce/glazed here but wish it was cook a bit more to a softer texture which will make it not only tastier but also much easier to eat.   Octo-Wasabi $3.50 ~ Tako Wasabi : Pickled Octopus w/ chopped wasabi stem ~Didn't like the pickled squid we got, so we decided to order this old favorite at the end and it was made just as we like it w/ extra wasabi (was in fact quite spicy)    Takoyaki $4.80 ~ Deep Fried octopus ball served w/ tonkatsu sauce & mayo ~Ben was somehow craving for this that night and I have no idea why it says deep fried on the menu since Takoyaki is not deep fried... Anyhow, it's probably cheapest takoyaki I had ever had in a restaurant even thou it wasn't anything special.   Verdict : ~Service was great but wish the waitresses are more knowledgeable about the menu items.  ~ Very affordable and conveniently located Uptown"}
{"text":"This place is amazing - all my 90s babies should reach cause the playlist definitely brought me back to my middle school days! Anyone remember Ashanti and Ja Rule? Ok now as I continue to write with several songs stuck in my head, I'd also like to point out the fact that this place accepts OpenTable reservations (yay!) And in fact, they do get all booked up, even on weekdays.  Recently I came on a Wednesday night to get their oyster specials with a friend who frequents here. So much better than Shore Club, the quality of these oysters so so much better and lots of oyster options too. So oysters are definitely a must here!   What else is a must? The sashimi salad - the texture was amazing and they gave great portions of sashimi too! Monkfish tacos were also really good - taste and texture wise! Takoyaki was also made perfectly! Lastly, definitely recommend the sweet potato fries - sounds very basic but trust me, try their sweet potato fries, one of the best I've had! The size of each fry and the softness level was very exact to my tastes (I sound like a fry expert).   Amazing food, lots of space (with a patio in the summer as well), wide selection of drinks, I mean, this is a perfect hang out spot with friends on any night! Highly recommend you make a reservation asap!"}
{"text":"Came here for dinner tonight with my bf and sis. Food are very fresh and tasty. We've tried their smoked scallop roll which is new item, very interesting and definitely can taste the smokiness in the roll.  Their pork belly is to die for!!!"}
{"text":"So, ordinarily I write this reviews with a few pictures. Tonight however we were very hungry and my phone was dying so we opted just to enjoy a great meal. The only bad thing I can say about this place is that there is no wheelchair accessible washroom. They warned us of that ahead of time and seated the two of us at a four person table to accommodate my handicapped son even though they were very busy and people were waiting to sit down. We started with a 21 piece order of Sashimi and a BBQ Duck Roll. Without any hesitation I would like to say that the plate of Sashimi that arrived was the finest I have ever had, period. This place sets the bar pretty darned high. The BBQ Duck Roll was something else entirely. If you are a fan of Peking Duck this one is for you. Every mouthful pays homage to a well prepared Peking Duck. My son did find this roll a little challenging as it requires some hearty chewing. This was a very great way to start the meal and we felt that they could not improve on this, we were wrong. Next up we asked for the Sliders, it seemed that everyone was ordering these so we had to try them too. With the Sliders we also requested the Deep Fried Pork Belly. They made the mistake of bringing them together. I took the tomato off one of the Sliders and gave that and a Pork belly to my son. He ate the Pork Belly, then took a bite of the Slider. He put the Slider down and absconded with the entire plate of Pork Belly.... I only got the one and he glared at me if I even tried to scoop another. To accompany the meal we had their sparkling and flat filtered water. The only way to improve on this would have been to have a little Sake but I was driving and it was late. With tip it came out to $110, more expensive than we are used to but worth every penny."}
{"text":"They have Buck and Shuck here on Tuesdays and Wednesdays..  From the outside, it looks like a typical eatery, on the inside, it is very nicely decorated, hip happening place. You need to book reservations here, walk in is not possible and there is a 2 hour per sitting policy.  We ordered 6 dozen of Buck a Shuck oysters, they have other oysters on the menu at discount also but we went with the buck a shuck.  We also ordered other Izakaya items on the menu,  Pork Belly - Deep Fried and melt in your mouth; Steak Tartar - It tasted ok but I am more in favor of the French influence than the Asian style. Squid Robata - Nice and tender with a glaze of sweetened teriyaki sauce  The place is busy but the servers are fast and the food does come out really fast.  The dishes are all tapas style so you need a few to get full."}
{"text":"Very sorry to have to give 2 stars.  Always liked this place. Been back many times but last visit was very disappointing. As we waited quite long for a table not because we didn't have reservation but due to the staff not efficiently turn table. We stood there for an extra 20 minutes waiting for a table to be cleared, while multiple wAitresses walked past the dirty table, looked and walked away. By the time we got seated, another 15 minutes until or order was taken.  But before our drinks and utensils were brought, our food begin to arrive.  Maybe they anticipated a crowd so some stuff were pre made (not impressed).  The food and drinks were just ok that night. Not hot enough and service was meh.  Maybe it was just a bad night. Hopefully they see this and make some changes."}
{"text":"Good food, good service thought the two times I've been here the diet coke was lacking in flavour.  Not sure how often they change the syrup.  Tried a large variety if the dishes and by far the best were the tiger shrimp.  The sliders were very good as well though the sashimi salad could have used a lot less dressing.  Good option if you're in the mood for izakaya uptown!"}
{"text":"Friendly staff.  Accommodated our birthday party of 16.  Ice cold beers in frozen mugs.....thank you.   Sliders were tasty.   Pork belly apps ......melt in your mouth but still crispy.  Variety of Ice cold oysters. Tasty.   Raw octopus in washabi sauce fresh.  Had a variety of sushi rolls.  Great job for presentation, great flavors bursting.  Don burri bowls were nice but a little thick on mayo sauce.   Chicken wings were nice n crispy.  Chinese teapots n tea were good.   Washrooms down stairs were clean in basement.  Lounge on second floor. Live DJ sat after 10pm. Nice touch. Paid  Parking in back was difficult to find, as expected for sat night."}
{"text":"I know there are quite a few izakaya places throughout the GTA, however, I have not liked a whole lot of them. I spent quite a bit of time in Vancouver and got into the Izakaya cuisine thing and found no real place convenient to me that had the same vibe. I know there was GUU but the one in north york is too sanitized. After looking at the reviews of Nome and the pix, it looked like a good place. Like a lot of Izakaya places, this place was packed in tight. We were there on Buck-a-Shuck night so it was extra hopping. First of all, the ambiance - busy, noisy, and hip! Nice! The oysters were real fresh and tasty! The selection of sauces were good too. The table was small for the four of us and if you order too much food, you will run out of space quickly, lucky for them, my kid can plow through a couple dozen oysters in one breath - so...I ordered a third dozen! We had the sliders and though it was good, I think they have way too much mayo stuff on it. The short ribs were too sweet but still good since you are only consuming a small piece per person. The edamame is a good choice - the black sesame dressing is awesome. We also had the chicken wings (better than most wing joints), the baked oyster (my pref would be to order more fresh ones), the yam fries (which is really sweet potato) and the salmon sashimi (a really tiny tiny portion of sliced salmon). Overall, it's a good place to go to get your Izaka-yeah! There's no place like Nome."}
{"text":"Went on a Wednesday night for their oysters special. I tried their malpeque and French kiss oysters. They both tasted similar but the French kiss oysters were a little bigger and double the price at $2 each. The oysters tasted very fresh and delicious! Would definitely come back for more. Their oysters specials are on Tuesdays and Wednesdays.   Also tried their japa burgers and black cod. The japa burgers were the size of sliders so they were a good size for me. The sliders were very juicy and tasted delicious but the buns were a little dry. The black cod was comparable to other izakaya places but it still tasted good.  I would definitely recommend making reservations for Tuesday and Wednesday nights if you plan to arrive after 6. I went at 5:30 and it was relatively empty but we had to finish by 7 because reservations were made by others at that time."}
{"text":"This place is a popular izakaya in Ktown north that does buck a shuck oysters on Tuesdays and Wednesdays. Malpeque oysters are a buck each and Fanny Bay ones go 8 for $10 on these two days. Make sure to make a reservation on oyster days, however, as walk in customers rarely get tables.   Aside from the oysters, Nomé is also good for their unique sushi rolls and izakaya style sharable dishes. The menu is a bit of hit or miss, but I would recommend the Double Salmon roll along with the Japa Burgers and Bulgogi Tacos. The tacos are legitimately the best Korean fusion tacos I have eaten so far!"}
{"text":"Food was really tasty, great for sharing with a group. We came on a Sunday around 7pn, it was really busy. Reservation recommended. Noise level was a little high but same with all bar/drink places."}
