{"text":"Tastefully decorated with wine bottles, glasses, and interesting lighting fixtures, the interior feels open and bright thanks to floor-to-ceiling windows. A fantastic outdoor back patio includes an outdoor bar and lounge areas. 

The service was pleasant and patient - We were given a bread basket with crispy flat bread seasoned with tarragon and a few slices of white bread. It was accompanied with a rather plain marinara sauce, which foreshadowed the upcoming meal.

Baby Red Romaine & Escarole Salad
Cara Cara orange, fennel, shaved Parmigiano-Reggiano and old wine vinaigrette 
A light start of fresh lettuce, a slightly tart vinaigrette, ripe Cara Cara orange, and cheese. While the orange and the dressing was enjoyable, something was left to be desired...perhaps it's because of my unrefined wine and cheese palette, but I wasn't particularly impressed. Memorable Summerlicious starter salads include the butterleaf truffle salad at Truffles at the Four Seasons (which has since closed) and Tutti Matti's carpaccio salads.

Bigeye Tuna Tartare & Spicy Sopressata 
Cracked olives, garlic grissini, arugula, lemon and Sicilian organic extra virgin olive oil 
Fresh tuna tartare on a bed of salami was a welcome dish, especially since I've never tried sopressata before. The saltyness of the cured ham paired with the freshnesses of the tuna created an interesting balance between bites. The olives were typical, and the bread sticks brought a crunch but no flavour to the plate. Perhaps if they were toasted a bit more or rolled in sesame, it would've been a nice compliment to the dish.

Wild & Tame Mushroom Soup 
Six kinds of mushrooms (no butter or cream)
Thick, warm, and hearty - this had the rich texture of a comforting soup despite the lack of cream or butter. I was impressed with the consistency and I love the taste of mushrooms so I thoroughly enjoyed this soup. As with the salad, there was something lacking - the \"wow\" factor that I always hope for at 'licious restaurants. The best mushroom soup that I've tasted was Wild Mushroom Soup from Tutti Matti - unfortunately not on their current menu.


Grilled Top Sirloin Fettina
Charred onion, heirloom tomato and rocket salad with crumbled Gorgonzola
The vegetables were nice and warm, and the sauce surrounding the steak sweet however the steak wasn't particularly interesting or great. Tender and nicely cooked, it was a good, simple cut of sirloin but didn't blow me away or leave a lasting impression on my palette.

Grilled Jail Island Salmon
Pickled summer beets, heirloom carrots, watercress salad and horseradish crème fraîche
Despite my half-success with the fish at Biff's Bistro, I decided that it was worth another go. While tasty, I'm quickly getting bored with this Summerlicious lunch. The beets were nice, warm, and soft and the horseradish crème fraîche had great flavour. However the salmon was...just salmon.

Roasted Portobello Mushroom & Brie Quesadilla
Caramelized onions, pico de gallo, chipotle crema, plantain tortilla chips and cilantro cress
My personal favourite of the entrées, the chipotle cream had a tangy flavour that tasted great with the pico de gallo and quesadilla. The pico de gallo (salsa) was ripe and simple. Always a fan of portobello, these quesadillas had great flavour. While an interesting visual, the tortilla chips were lacking the flavour I usually enjoy from plantains. As a plantain chip lover, they were a disappointment. I'd rather crack open a bag of the Samai Plantain chips that I got addicted to Barbados.

Chocolate Toffee Crunch Cheesecake
Dulce de leche cream
Thick cheesecake that was more toffee-like than chocolate. The caramel was pleasant with the dense cake. I wasn't a fan of the bit of toffee that accompanied the cake but overall I'd say that this was the best dessert out of the three.


Bavarian Vanilla Cream
Ontario strawberry compote and dark cherry balsamic
Nice and warm with a smooth texture, the vanilla cream dessert sat on one of the better compotes that I've tried. I found myself scooping this dessert up more for the compote than the cream.

Coconut Rum Baba 
Tropical fruit salad and banana cream
This spongy cake was covered with coconut shavings over pineapple, mango, and lychee. A sweet, generous drizzle of rum syrup soaked into the cake quite nicely. While I wasn't the biggest fan of this dessert initially, over time as I enjoyed my company it grew on me. It wasn't too rich or filling.

Wonderfully designed and decorated, Jump Café & Bar creates a vibrant, young, and upscale environment quite well. I would return for a drink at the bar, and the service was fantastic. However, I thought it was missing that the \"oomph\" factor that would make me wholeheartedly recommend this restaurant for future Summerlicious romps. This is a good spot to take someone who wants a very simple no-frills meal."}
{"text":"Small portions that did not reflect the menu... For example: Leg of Lamb was four small medallions; Tortellini was 6 Tortellini pieces...  You need to grab a bite before you show up.  Also, wine was only for the men as the waiter only topped up the men's glasses and the women had to fend for themselves. The food is good but small... The service is lacking in so many ways. The desserts were weak... A custard dish had the consistency of milk.  Jump used to be a place where it was an experience.  They had high standards for their food and service. It is clearly now a franchise with no attention to detail. At three different points in the meal we had to ask what the specials were as the server did not know them. Each time the server had to go to the kitchen to find out (soup, main and dessert).  My wife worked there 20 years ago and it is no longer that place.  How times have changed. It is now just a franchise licensed name that rides its laurels and lacks that je ne c'est quoi of a better time.  Sorry for the rant but this place has killed it for me and all O & B places are now dead to me. Sad as this used to be a name in Toronto dining and now it is an embarrassment."}
{"text":"My dinner came with a fridge cold temperature. Can you believe it? Who serves cold steak? I ask them to heat it up and it was still cold after reheating. The food was really tough to swallow and forget about the taste because it would make me to look like I was asking too much."}
{"text":"I went here for Winterlicious ($35 prix fixe).

1) Appetizer - Pork Terrine 3/5 
- I've have better pork terrine from certain markets and grocery stores.

2) Main - Beef cheek 3.5/5 
- the beef was tender and the portion size was good

3) Dessert - Bread pudding 4/5
- this was delicious and was the best part of the meal

This is an Oliver and Bonacini restaurant that I don't believe is one of their better ones. It's not bad, but it's not great. The ambiance and the food do not leave a lasting impression. I prefer Biff's Bistro and Canoe for their higher end restaurants, and Bannock and the O&B Canteen for a more casual atmosphere. Jump should be somewhere in the middle, but it's not up to par with the others.  I would choose somewhere else to go to for a regular night out for dinner."}
{"text":"Came here for their winterlicious menu. Overall I give the experience a 3 to be nice. 

The negatives:
As someone else has already previously mentioned, they overdo with the salt here. The jump fries and the mushroom ravioli was way too salty. You could not taste anything else. Also, the waiter forgot to tell me and my friend his name, so the customer service is lacking. 

The positives:
The desserts we had were great."}
{"text":"If you're a fan of the O&B spots, then check this one out.  Great for the lunch time crowd.  Menu, good choices.  If you need to plan a business lunch downtown, this is a great spot.  And if the other person is paying... order everything on the menu :)  If i worked in the area, I'd definitely make it here once a week."}
{"text":"Food was good ... Service was inattentive and slow.  We were a party of 10 ... Lack of attention from the servers got way more air time in the conversation than it should have."}
{"text":"I went to Jump for a Winterlicious Lunch because I had heard great things about it and wanted to give it a try. To my surprise, the limited menu was interesting and the food was great! I had the Chicken Milanese which was amazing (very soft and juicy) and the apple crostada for dessert, although it seemed more like a crumble, but still very good! My partner ordered the crab cakes for an appetizer and the BBQ pulled beef ribs sandwich for a main which I was lucky enough to try and they both were delicious!
The environment was elegant, my only complaint was the slow service. We waited forever to order our meal and there was an uncomfortable delay between courses. Other than that, unique atmosphere with excellent food. I would definitely do it all over again."}
{"text":"A great restaurant, but a little over on the pricey side.

Service: Excellent - I didn't realize we were supposed to be served bread+dip, the waiter pointed it out himself, apologized and brought it over right away. He checked on us multiple times even though he was serving a table of ~20 guests. The servers who walk the food over are just as nice and check in with their guests to make sure everything is going well.

Food: The food was of great quality for the most part. The mains were perfect, the Ricotta Agnolotti tastes great and the pasta melts in your mouth. I wasn't a fan of the prosciutto bits (too salty). The Grilled Chicken was juicy and tender for the most part, I enjoyed the little salad it came with.

Overall, great experience and I'll be back in the near future."}
{"text":"Service was impeccable! Space is gorgeous! And the food tiny portions of delight! 

Cocktail & appetizer reception was done beautifully. we had our own little section of the restaurant, where we enjoyed drinks and a delicious assortment of food. i will definitely have to go back!"}
{"text":"Horrible, horrible lunch experience. Went with my colleague and boss (his first time), we sat in the bar area because we made reservations late which was fine. Our waitress (unfortunately I did not get her name, but I think she was European) was curt, quick and to the point. I ordered the roasted chicken caeser salad. The description on the menu had kale, romaine, pancetta, broccoli, pretzel croutons. There was no kale, pancetta was about the size of a toonie, one stem of broccoli and one tiny piece of a pretzel crouton, and I think I had about 3 oz. of roasted chicken. This was all for the amazing price of $23.00. I asked the waitress if I could have more croutons and she brought over a plate and they were good. We ordered the French fries and that was the best thing. Not once did the waitress ask us if our food was good or if we wanted extra cheese or pepper. Needless to say I will not be back to Jump. There are too many other restaurants in the area."}
{"text":"Went for summerlicious and was quite impressed despite reading negative reviews upon going! Highly recommend! Excellent staff and service!"}
{"text":"Had a very nice lunch experience at Jump, i enjoyed the modern yet intimate decor of Jump and found the service to be professional and helpful 

I had the juice of the day and it was very nice and refreshing, then started with the mushroom soup (loved the fact that there was no cream in the soup, made it much healthier... i hope), then had the bay scallops parpadelle (the pasta was toothsome and i know for some ppl they might not like how naked the pasta is  i.e. little sauce but i absolutely loved that, i don't like pasta that swims in a puddle of suace)

I hope to return to try the dinner service"}
{"text":"SERVICE

This is my first review where the place and service were good enough for me to consider giving the place a 3 despite the food, but really, I came for the food, ya know.

Everybody smiles offensively, not defensively, quick with service, think it's a biz crowd, so time is of the essence, boom, boom, order, 2 min, apps, same for rest, of course it's summerlic so prob they're stockpiling back there.

FOOD

Ya know, I knew going in that this was an O&B offering, yeah, I knew, and, for some god unknown reason, I went anyway, despite never having a single good exp with O&B brand.  Either I'm getting more particular or O&B is getting more egregious.

Crab cakes, baked dry, the sauce kinda compensates, big though, this sucker, the sauce is uh, off, too, like it came out of a jar or something, not made in-house, is it poss?  Has O&B decided to factory-produce sauces for all its restosÉ

Porchetta was just pulled pork, is that misleading?  I'm googling now and it's popping up as ya know the rolled up roasted kind as served @ Porchetta & Co.  The foccacia is fakakta.  Kettle chips?  Some freakin mayo over them, wtf?!  These chips were even the decent store bought kind ... thin and now moistened by the mayo so a bit soggy.

Dessert, oh boy, yup, rum cake coulda been set deco in rum diary, not meant to be eaten only seen, inedible, that sauce, coloured sugar whipped up.

So overpowering the sauces, so bland the food, and so mediocre, which is putting it nicely ... I'd rather eat @ Big Smoke for these calories and cloggers.  

Freakin O&B dressed up crap strikes again!"}
{"text":"Had a decent dinner here while in Toronto on vacation.
Our waiter was a very serious guy who barely cracked a smile the whole night.  Very attentive and accomodating though, which I like.
I thought the menu was good.  As a vegatarian, I was pleased to see several options on the menu.
Food was good and portions were decent.  Cocktails were a bit pricey though and their beer menu was lacking."}
{"text":"The only time I have ever eaten here was in August 2008. My wife and I were on our honeymoon and we had had a rough day. They took care of us and turned our night around and even gave us a free desert. They earned the undying loyalty of my wife and if we are ever back in Toronto it is guaranteed we will be back."}
{"text":"I feel like jump is pretty overrated. I had the quails tacos which was pretty good but not fantastic. I think the renovations  at jump were a nice upgrade and match the Bay street atmosphere. But overall the food is too expensive for the quality. I think earls is a safer bet than jump. Jump has some dishes which are good but not fantastic or they have dishes that are just subpar."}
{"text":"Great good, comfortable atmosphere, great service. We had a large group of people and everyone had a different entree - no complaints. Poor appitizer selection but overall very happy we went there."}
{"text":"First let me start off by saying that Jump is right smack dab in the middle of the financial district. That being said Its not really in my preferred price range but my coworkers wanted to go here for lunch so i hesitantly obliged. 

The place was happening (do ppl still say that?). It was packed and I'd say 90% of the people were probably having a business meeting.

Now I ordered a chicken Caesar salad (which was actually quite delicious) and a pint of mill st and after a mandatory 18% tip and taxes, I paid about $40.

Tbh I usually spend that much on a weeks worth of lunches at subway, but the price is the price and I agreed to go. I think ill only go back during winterlicious."}
{"text":"We went when they had a part of the restaurant sectioned off for a party, and it was loud as hell.

After finishing our appetizers which were okay, we waited around 35 minutes for our main dishes to arrive, the excuse was that they were busy preparing the party's dishes. When our main dishes arrived; they were cold and honestly nothing amazing in terms of taste. Furthermore; my cousin ordered his steak done medium and got it rare.

The dishes are overpriced and the quality overall is average. With the many options one has in the Financial District, I would recommend looking up any other restaurant."}
{"text":"3.5 out of 5! One of the better O&B restaurants. Recommend the gnocchi, lamb tenderloin and box of jump fries"}
{"text":"Pretty standard food, ambiance and experience.  Nice place to go after work for a drink.  Staff is nice and wine list is pretty good as well.  Tends to be a little more low key too than say a Ki or FOUR so the afterwork meat market cougar fest is less likely to be found here.
Ill be back...:)"}
{"text":"I came here for summerlicious and was not at all impressed.

The food was far too salty (I could barely finish my appetizer). The balance was totally off. The meat was too tough (and tasteless if not for the goat cheese). The chocolate cheesecake was far too sweet (though very smooth).  We were stuck in a corner. And no one came to check up on us. 

Would I come back? Probably not."}
{"text":"Friendly staff, nice decor and amazing food. Make sure you try the white chocolate cheesecake with filo."}
{"text":"I have been to Jump a number of times over the years, as it is a popular lunch spot situated in the middle of the financial district.  The service is great and the food consistently good.  The mushroom soup (a staple at O&B restaurants) is a must. 

The patio is busy in the summer.  Thursday is the busiest night with the after work crowd of the financial district. However, the dining room can get quite noisy due to the large glass windows which makes the conversation of patrons seem even louder. Having said that, the atmosphere is lively and energetic. Definitely worth a visit."}
{"text":"Jump has very good food, but i would say for a casual, 'after work ' restaurant it might be a bit pricey. having said that, it worth the money. nice people, the right size of portions. remember to shake the hand of the 'business man statue' in the lobby, as it will give you good luck (if you can, spare 25 cents and leave it on his business man hat... it will give you fortune)"}
{"text":"I love Jump and go all the time!

A note to those who go for Winterlicious/Summerlicious... Restaurants are NEVER as good as they normally are during those events.  I will NEVER EVER go to a restaurant during that time of year, bad idea people.  Even very very expensive restaurants quality suffer during that time.

Needless to say I have always received excellent service at Jump.  They have very friendly and kind staff and the food is always delicious.  I ordered a steak at 10:30pm last night and it was by far the best steak I have had in a long time.  

Great place to go for drinks or dinner, don't let the Winter/Summerlicious reviews throw you off this place, it has always been a great place for food and drinks.  Many of us from the Bay and King area go a few times a week and are always happy with Jump!"}
{"text":"Good points: beautiful decor, service was friendly, prompt and attentive. 

Cons: the food is just average. Had a party of 6 and we all ordered a variety of items off the lunch menu. Tuna tartare, soup, salads (green and chopped), pasta and calamari. For the price you would think it would be mind blowing. Average and not memorable."}
{"text":"Came here for Summerlicious lunch, everyone at our table ordered the Chilled Pea Soup as appetizer which was the highlight of the meal for me. It was refreshing and has a slight kick from the chilli oil drizzled on top.

The B.C. Keta Salmon was served on top of smoked farro, braised kale, pickled mushrooms in maple dashi broth.  It has a good balance between the acidity and savoury. The salmon itself was a bit undercooked probably due to the lunch rush.
 
Artisan Chocolate Marquise Cake was not overly sweet, the cherry compote complemented the cake nicely.

The servers were attentive, however the food service was slow for our table. Also, our orders got mixed up twice (chicken instead salmon, and the cheese plate instead of chocolate cake)."}
{"text":"This restaurant is quite simply beautiful! Spacious and modern, with high ceilings, and unique conversation-worthy light fixtures. My friend and I agreed that is one of the most gorgeous venues we've ever dined in, without being over the top and pretentious.

We made reservations for the Summerlicious Menu. Here's what we ate:

1) Crab BLT

This was HUGE. A bit big for an app, but we welcomed it. The crab was delicious. Thankfully no Pollock here, but truth be told I would never expect imitation from an O&B restaurant. 

The only downfall of this dish was that the bun was dried out. It appears that it had been pre-toasted for service, and tasted like it had been left out on the counter for too long.

2) Sustainable BC Albacore Tuna

I am not a raw fish kind of person (I'm still working on it), but this dish was the highlight of our night! All of the flavours were harmonious, and there was a good amount of veg on the plate, which I appreciate. The smoke of the barbecue did not overwhelm the fish, and there was just enough acidity to balance everything out. Loved this, and would definitely order it again.

3) Tandoori Lamb Sirloin

Unfortunately, our lamb was really underdone, closer to medium rare than medium.  I would have been okay with it had it been tender, but it was tough to saw through. This might just be a case of personal preference, however.

While there was a hint of Tandoori in the dish, it wasn't quite enough. The accompanying raita lacked seasoning, as did the slaw. A little bit of salt and acid would have gone a long way to brighten the flavours of this dish.

4) Cannoli with Pistachios and Lemon Curd

A nice sweet finish. 

5) Double Chocolate Brownie

I love the pairing of raspberries and chocolate, so this worked perfectly for me. The brownie was surprisingly moist!

The service was undeniably excellent tonight, and bumps my rating to a 4/5. I would definitely come back to try their regular menu."}
{"text":"1: Poor 2: OK 3: Good 4: Very Good 5: Excellent

Food: 4 
Service: 4 
Ambiance: 4
Overall: 4

I came here for their Summerlicious menu for dinner with a friend recently. We both ordered the crab BLT for our appetizer, the BC albacore tuna and the tandoori lamb for our mains, and the cannoli and strawberries to end off on a sweet note.

The crab BLT was refreshing and not mayonnaise heavy like many seafood sandwiches. What my friend and I absolutely loved were the vegetable chips that accompanied them. Those chips were so addicting! We commented on how we prefer them over potato chips and wish we could make them at home.

My BC tuna was great. The salad it came with and the dressing matched perfectly with the freshness of the tuna. Great presentation as well. I loved the grilled oyster mushroom it came with. My friend said her tandoori lamb was the most tender lamb she's ever tasted. I couldn't agree more. No weird gamey aftertaste either.

Dessert was ok. I've had way better cannolis in Scarborough and elsewhere. The mascerated strawberries with ice-cream was simple and done right. So simple I could make them at home. On the plus side, you could see vanilla bean in the ice cream. Legit.

We had a bottle of pinot grigio as suggested by our server and I think he made a great pairing to our dishes.

Summary: Good food, great service, the place was also newly renovated so that's definitely a plus. Would definitely come back to try their regular menu! A solid 4.

Recommendations: Crab BLT (wish we could ask for extra veggie chips!)"}
{"text":"Loved!!! So welcoming, amazing share plate of chateaubriand. Highly recommend this - the au jus is outstanding with this. We really loved the Caesar salad and the kale and cauliflower salad. Will be back to try the burger next."}
{"text":"We went as part of Winterlicious this year and it was well worth the visit.  A great ambiance overall.

Wine list: decent but could have been more expansive

Appetizers:
Kale Salad - Quite tasty but it reminded me of something I would make at home
Pork Terrine - I didn't personally care for this.  Somewhat bland and the pickled onions had an unusual sweetness to them

Entrees:
Lamb Meatball with spaghetti - A huge meatball, perfectly seasoned and moist.
Beef Cheeks - Unbelievably tender, no knife needed.  A little on the rich side but very good overall

Desserts:
Bread Pudding - It was good and not overly heavy but the size of a brick
White Chocolate Panna Cotta - Very nice and subtle in flavour as it should be.  It was very enjoyable overall

Definitely worth a return visit."}
{"text":"Lunched here late-ish (1pm) mid-week with a co-worker.

Lovely seat by a window in a relatively private booth.
Service was attentive and expedient. However, there was a bit of disdain in the waiter's voice when we inquired about the daily specials (as laid out on the website and menu) as well as the soup of the day. All had run out for the day :( According to the waiter we should have been there by noon to have any expectation of trying a special :(

I ordered the jerk chicken caesar salad - an interesting take on a classic. It was made more interesting by the addition of corn and beans (not something I would have put on my salad, and I probably won't be replicating this at home). 

Both the chicken on my salad and the fish order by my colleague were dry - as though they were prepared for the noon rush and merely leftover when we arrived at 1pm. I guess the silver lining is that our meals were on the table much more quickly than expected.

Over all, this experience was a little below my expectations for the location, prices, and reputation. Perhaps I will give Jump another try when it isn't the end of a shift in order to try the specials and find a more congenial waiter.

p.s. the peach-mango juice was delicious but too viscous for my coworker."}
{"text":"Meh, it was ok. The ambiance is nice and service is good but the food is mediocre. For the price, there are better places to go around the area."}
{"text":"Incredible! Wooed myself and friends from the moment we walked in. Was offered a appy from the manager while we all had a drink at the bar and waited for our table. (Possibly the best spring rolls ever.. Or I was starving;) Marketa was our server and was on point all night. We all decided to partake in the Winterlicious menu and she offered great recommendations including the wine parings which my husband loved! It's rare to have a dining experience where the service, atmosphere and food are equally 10s. We all loved our dishes and were discussing when we will come back! The regular menu is a bit pricy but well worth it I'm sure. If you are curious (as we were) then try the Winterlicious menu and come hungry!"}
{"text":"I love the ambiance in this place. Trendy and fun, lots of people from the after-work crowd.

We went here as a group for Winterlicious. We all enjoyed our meals but wouldn't say they were extraordinary. I guess it's hard to make \"American\" cuisine extraordinary though.

Appetizer - Spice-Roasted Pumpkin Soup: This was pretty good, I'm a huge fan of pumpkin anything so I might be a little biased. The crab in it was a nice touch.

Main - Goat Cheese Stuffed Atlantic Salmon: YUM! The salmon was moist and tender and the goat cheese was really nice. This was a pretty light main - it came with a side of a few grilled veggies. This is good though when you are planning on eating three courses.

Dessert - White Chocolate Panna Cotta: The waitress recommended this to us and so I went for it. I wasn't a huge fan. Not a fan of the texture of panna cotta and had to really focus to taste the hints of white chocolate. That being said, the waitress was willing to trade it in (great service!) for something else, but we politely declined.

So overall, it was an enjoyable meal but wish I'd gone for the fruit instead for dessert!"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch and ordered the salmon entree on a chickpea salad.  Salmon was awful.  Cooked rock hard and dry.  Needed a steak knife to cut because a butter knife wouldn't do.  Waiters solution was coffee on the house.  Salmon reminds me of when my 8 year old nephew offered to cook me chicken the very first time... glad to see jump is hiring our youth."}
{"text":"Went there last night with the girls.  I had the beef tenderloin and a glass of red.  The waiter was VERY fast with getting our orders and getting us our food, then literally disappeared (otherwise this would probably get 5 stars).  The beef was amazing, done exactly how I wanted it, the sauce that accompanied was so good I couldn't help dipping all the bread in.  The mushrooms were a bit rubbery, but that would be my only concern on the food.  The free bread was amazing, the tomato sauce they bring with it was so fresh tasting, it was wonderful.  I will definitely go back with my husband (and hopefully get a different waiter?)."}
{"text":"First time at this restaurant and it did not disappoint! The service was excellent from the hostess to our server at the table. Our water glass were never empty and we didn't even have to ask for someone to come to fill it. And our server was very hot which added more points! 

I started off with the \"Guilt & Honey\" bourbon recommended by the server as it is sweet and covers the bourbon taste yet it is still alcoholic. It was good, loved it, I like a cocktail that is on a sweet side. They brought out a complementary salad for us - cucumber, carrot salad to start off.

For the main, I was in between dishes but I decided to get the Roasted Australian Lamb Saddle - with pea puree, potatoes and mint sauce. The plate looks like an artwork when it came to the table, so beautiful that you don't want to mess it up. But I had to eat and it tastes as pretty as it looks. The lamb was tender (I got it medium) and it did not have the \"gamey\" taste at all. The spice rub on top, I think it is pistachio was very good with the mint sauce. I pretty much clean the entire plate clean. We didn't have room for dessert, maybe next time. 

The atmosphere was good, even though we sat right at the entrance, there was still some privacy and was not super noisy. It was a great night catching up with my girlfriend! We ended up there for nearly 3 hours."}
{"text":"My rating is based on the food and overall ambience. When I go to an expensive restaurants I expect GOURMET MOUTH WATERING food. Unfortunately the food was not memorable, they didnt have much selection, the portions were smaller than average (i'm talking the full/dinner size!). Worst of all-EVERYTHING WAS SALTY! We went for a friends birthday dinner and the whole party agreed that the food was much too salty for the average taste buds. It was very loud (obnoxious people sat next to us), music was on the louder side, service was relatively slow and our plates came out in intervals so we had to wait for everyone to get their plates (not fun) The staff was friendly so thats one plus. The ambience matches that of joeys restaurant so if thats the feel you like maybe this is the place for you. My overall rating was definitely heavily determined by the saltiness of the food."}
{"text":"Had a great time here last spring for my anniversary with my girlfriend (who is actually not the other yelp reviewer -- just a coincidence). Reserved by phone and was asked if it was a special occasion, I told them it was an anniversary and that seems to be a thing they pay attention to. We had a delicious rack of lamb and smashed potatoes, I forget what else we ordered but it was good. At the end of the meal, they brought us a dessert plate, on the house, with \"Happy Anniversary\" written in chocolate icing. It was a wonderful, memorable time, and reasonably priced. I left a big tip."}
{"text":"This has to be the most pretentious restaurant in Toronto. The servings are very small, the food is tasteless and the servers are snobby and stuck up.
I had the taco special, the tortillas were 'homemade' thick and tough so they would NOT bend to hold the fillings. My friends had very small servings of pasta and an unidentifiable curry. One friend sent the ice tea back after one sip and she almost spit it out it was so bad.
I would not recommend this place to anyone.....EVER!"}
{"text":"Well I just went through a bunch or reviews and there isn't much more I can add to praise the food or presentation! Both were very good and the flavours left my pallet more than satisfied. We were at Jump for Summerlicious Dinner - my second time but my wife had worked downtown has been here several times for lunch and she said she never had a bad meal here over the last 10 or 15 years. 

I had the gazpacho(nice &spicy) and my wife had crab cakes. We both had Korean BBQ Ribs - Asian Sweet and very tender with asparagus mashed roasted potatoes - excellent and for dessert we both had the sweet cake with lemon curd and blue berries.

I must mention our server Courtney who was pleasant and chatty and kept our wine glasses filled with that very good house CabSav offered at $40 for Summerlicious. More restaurants should offer reasonable priced wines. All in all a great evening!"}
{"text":"You follow your heart to find the love of your life.  When choosing the perfect place to celebrate your love, you follow your gut.  And my gut told me, \"White Chocolate Cheesecake, Double-baked in Phyllo with Biscotti Crust.\"

The private dinning at Jump was perfect for an intimate celebration I had in mind, warm, classy and stylish.  The restaurant event coordinator was professional, highly organized and very accommodating throughout the planning process.

The chef did a phenomenal job of creating delicious vegan dishes for our vegetarian friends.

Hors d' oeuvres:
+Mango and crunchy vegetable rice paper roll was fresh and tasty.
+Spiced beef empanada with chipotle sour cream was so good, there was none left.  Golden pastry crust and flavorful filling.
+Vegetable samosa was crispy and lip-smacking good.

Appetizers:
+Peekytoe Crab Cakes with celeriac remoulade and citrus dill caper dressing.  Hands down, one of the best crab cake I have ever had.
+Boneless Bacon Wrapped Quail with fiery pineapple B.B.Q.  Thumbs up from the guests who ordered them.
+Wild & Tame Mushroom soup.  If you see this on the menu, try it.  \"No less than six type of mushroom with no cream or butter,\" our chef friend couldn't stop talking about how tasty it was.

Entree:
+New York Strip & Shrimp with buttermilk mashed potatoes.  This was no ordinary surf & turf.  Tomato onion confit, sticky mushroom gravy and broccolini complimented the steak and shrimp perfectly.

+Mahogany Glazed Black Cod.  I normally don't care for cod, but that glazed buttery cod with madras curried lentils, cilantro and mint chutney was so good!

Desserts.
+Soma Molten Chocolate Cake with espresso créme anglaise.
+Banana Cream Pie with toasted coconut and caramel sauce.
+White Chocolate Cheesecake, double-baked in phyllo with biscotti crust.
They were all fantastic.  Everyone practically licked their plate.

I was extremely pleased with the high level of professionalism and service of the staff.  The head wait staff was terrific.  She was polite, attentive, and had a good sense of humor.

What a wonderful evening that was, good food, intimate and warm space and impeccable service."}
{"text":"I have been here twice, and I enjoyed the both dining experience at Jump.
We had few appetizers and loved their alcohol (wine) selections. 
Service was excellent in both times. Also, highly recommended if you are looking for a restaurant venue. We had small party in this restaurant and it was amazing 4-course meal."}
{"text":"We love O&B restaurants (at least from the ones we've tried) so we \"jumped\" at the chance of trying this place during winterlicious 2012.

Peekytoe Crab Cake -My friend went with this and I wish I had too, because it was simply DELICIOUS. The outside was perfectly crispy and the inside was soft and melted in my mouth. The dill pickle tartar sauce was the perfect sauce.

Oyster Mushroom Salad - was refreshing and great as an appetizer. There were plenty of oyster mushrooms, fresh arugula leaves and parmesan bread crumbs.  The dressing was very flavourful - a great match for the oyster mushrooms.

Slow Roast Pork Shoulder - The smoked bacon and onion jam was impressive as it went really well with the tender pork and roasted potatoes.  I usually don't go for Pork dishes at restaurants but this one is definitely a winner!

Classic Carrot Cake - I heard great things about it but it was a bit too heavy for me.  I only took a few bites. It was yummy, nonetheless - I wish I had more space in my stomach!

Milk Chocolate Panna Cotta - the lighter dessert choice.  It was the perfect end to her dinner, especially with the paired ice wine.

We also opted for the Wine Pairing option at an additional $20.  Our server was so knowledgeable about our wine pairing and each glass complemented the paired dish wonderfully."}
{"text":"I'm trying to be a little more discerning in my reviews now, as a 3 star rating might be a little out of character for me.  In summary, service was very good, food was on the pricey side, and I didn't get to try the cocktails today!

On the service side our waiter was very attentive and made sure that water was kept full throughout, BUT I realized that we missed out on the amazing bread and dip that is given while waiting on the meal.

For food I had the daily special which was a jalepeno turkey burger.  It was pretty good and the root chips it came with were excellent! However, for the price I would go for the ahi tuna burger with its more substantial sides at Ki over this any day.

I did notice that there were some pretty good prix fixe options available for dinner, and any place that proudly displays Makers on a wall should have some pretty good cocktails, so I will be coming back and hoping to see my rating go up!"}
{"text":"Went to Winterlicious lunch; there was certainly no danger of overeating. A total rip-off!!!

1. The lobster bisque was seriously watered down. 
2. Bangers & mash had only 1 sausage.  Since when \"bangers\" mean 1.
3. The \"desert bar\" was the size of 2 Dairy Milk squares.
4. Coffee was also seriously watered down.
5. $28 + tax + tip.

I realize the Winterlicious is a stunt to bring in people during a very quiet time,  but a scam like this will not have people coming back."}
{"text":"Visited for the first time during Summerlicious. Food was good, though not outstanding. Ordered wine. At first it tasted a little off and smelled dusty. Staff person (perhaps supervisor?) advised it was fine - that's just how the wine tastes. We tried it in another glass...lo and behold, it was fine. The first glass - the actual glass itself - had been quite dusty. She completely ignored that - no comment, no apology. In fact, she treated us and the situation with disdain. The food didn't leave a bad taste in our mouths - that server did. Fortunately she only served the wine. Our food server was great."}
{"text":"I would only give one star because Summerlicious courses disappointed me so much. Food courses are ugly and not tasty at all. To me the starter today tasted like toothpaste and the main course tasted like dishsoap. Will never go there again."}
{"text":"Resto \"trendy' du centre-ville du célèbre \"Oliver and Bonacini Restaurants Group\" (voir leur site web pour les autres restos). Pour avoir essayé 3 des restos du groupes, je crois qu'ils ont des établissements de qualité avec un bon rapport qualité/prix, et Jump ne fait pas exception.
Le plafond extrèmement haut et l'atmosphère bruyante enlève un peu d'intimité à l'endroit, mais le décor feutré, les gros fauteuils et l'éclairage tamisé compensent amplement.
Nous avons mangé un des \"Daily Specials\", le \"SUNDAY\" GRAVY FOR TWO:
beef short ribs, pork tenderloin, sausage, fresh bucatini (pasta), green salad, crusty bread (79$ pour 2 personnes). Il s'agit d'un plat traditionnel italien à partager qui consiste à plusieurs délicieuses pièces de viande dans un bouillon, toutes cuites à la perfection. Le tout accompagné de pates cuites dans le bouillon de viande, de délicieuses pommes de terre, de rapinis sautés, de pain grillé et d'une salade verte.
Sélection de vins au verre bien.
Service très bien.
J'aurais donné 4.5/5 si j'avais pu écrire \".5\"..."}
{"text":"For those staying at near by hotels such as the one king west this restaurant is very convenient. We loved the food/ service. Bravo!!"}
{"text":"I had a great lunch at Jump on a weekday.  The place was fairly busy at the time yet we still got top-notch service.

The prices were a little high, but the quality of the food was definitely above average.  I enjoyed a Caesar salad and the salmon dish and was very pleased with both.

They also have a nice patio which is perfect for after work drinks."}
{"text":"Jump truly made my tastebuds jump!

Came here for Valentine's Day but ordered off the regular menu. We started off with the Yellowfin Tuna Tartare, which tasted wonderful with the chips they came with. 

For the entrees, we got the beef and boar bolognese and the baked ricotta gnocchi. We would not recommend getting extra cheese on these dishes, as they were already very cheesy originally. The beer and boar bolognese was a bit on the salty side, but the texture pasta noodles tasted very good. The gnocchi tasted EXTREMELY cheesy, so that is good news for cheese lovers. It was kind of bland, so we asked the waiter to give us oregano and chilli flakes on the side, which made the dish much better (sidenote: great customer service from the waiter who went out of his way to find us the extra seasoning)

For drinks we ordered the berry bliss cocktail and the lovers lychee mocktail, and they went great with the meal.

Overall, had a great experience here and would definitely consider returning!"}
{"text":"Came here for an event. The sangria is a must. This refreshing drink definitely highlighted my evening, and we had a lot. The venue had been renovated since the last I went, with many classy modern lighting. The food is like any O&B standard fare. Please note washroom is on a second floor and requires flight of stairs"}
{"text":"I love Jump!!! I had the best dining experience in a long time. Our waiter was so helpful and patient (i'm indecisive). It was great."}
{"text":"I visited Jump for a mid-week dinner with a couple of friends/colleagues who were visiting from Dublin. I've been once before and I have enjoyed it both times. Our server was very friendly and helpful, and the service was excellent. The menu was varied and the food we each chose was wonderful. Beautifully presented, good quality and excellent taste. It's pricey compared to some restaurants in the area, but I feel that the price was comparable to the experience. A great place to take visitors."}
{"text":"Had walked by this place many times during my lunch hour downtown but knew it was a bit too expensive for work lunch for me personally...keeping in mind to try for dinner eventually.  Plus it's rather well-known.

So tried it on a summer Monday evening at 6.  Figured it would be dead but there were a few people.  Rather large inside, sort of divided into three sections, although all semi-visible, just separated from a large, artsy floor lamp in one part, and low wall dividers.  A few booths.  Mostly tables, I'd say 50 in total??  

Fine service.  Nothing memorable.

Free bread?  Small basket of white bread slices and good crustini crisps for dipping in a tomato sauce oil?  
App:  Good mozzerella tomato salad ($14.95).  
App:  Good sized romaine salad.  The other in my party refused to call it a proper Caesar since it lacked bacon and croutons.  Had an actual anchovie, which he refused to eat.  lol
Entree:   Very good truffle mushroom gnocchi - although I recommend the dinner size for sure.  The lunch size must be tiny as the dinner to me was just right.  
Entree:  Apparently a fantastic steak, good size, cooked propertly to order.  Very tiny portion of mashed potato on the side.  
Dessert:  Good toffee creme brule, with two tiny chocolate cookies on the side.  Also good molten chocolate cake.

Drinks:  Ordered the Niagara 'Jump' chardonnay for $40/btl.  Very satisfying.

Would I go back??  Probably.  Nothing at all stood out about this place to make me recommend it again, but 
nothing wrong with it."}
{"text":"As S.S. said, this is a pretty good place.  The food is well above-average, the decor is upscale and the service is attentive.  My risotto was good, and my girlfriend's pasta was good as well.  It may not be amazing or extraordinary, but if you are looking for a consistently good, solid, quality upscale-type place, then this one will definitely suffice."}
{"text":"I could eat a bucketfull of the bacon wrapped quail. The service was outstanding. They stop short of a rave for me for puddles of water on the bathroom counter (c'mon guys!) and a pretty fatty veal shoulder I had for my main along with heart-stopping polenta fries that would put KFC to shame."}
{"text":"We were so lucky to find this place since there are so many options in a city like Toronto. First and most important, the drinks were perfect - updated old school and inventive concoctions. It looked like a great wine selection too but we stayed with cocktails. Our table skip the appetizers and went straight to entrees in hopes of saving room for dessert. We had the Short Rib ( more like a brontosaurus Rib), pumpkin ravioli, roasted duck and lasagna. All of it was delicious and received raves. My short rib came with a breaded fried Yukon potato side that was creative and delicious. We only were able to have one dessert for four - a key lime with lavender torched meringue. Service was top notch and everyone was incredibly friendly and comfortable. The atmosphere was sophisticated yet comfortable and one wall was entirely a wine rack. Great dining experience."}
{"text":"My last and probably best stop on the Winterlicious-see-how-fat-we-can-make-Jacob 2014 tour! 
To start me and my guest decided to try the wine pairings with our courses and split each dish, so we could each try 6 dishes and glasses of wine. Awesome idea..unless you REALLY want to finish a dish because it's great! Haha. And with the food at Jump we ran into that conundrum more than once.
The appetizers were a pumpkin soup and a dinosaur kale and ricotta salad...which I'm not ashamed to say was ordered purely on the basis of having 'dinosaur' in the name, heh. It was tart and delicious with small chunks of fig going nicely with the ricotta and kale. The pumpkin soup was OK, but not really to my taste because of the crab in the soup.
For mains, we had goat cheese stuffed Atlantic salmon and braised beef cheeks on bean ragout. I'd like to talk about the salmon, but it was so good that I barely got any by the time my dinner partner was done with it. Haha. The beef cheeks were well done and the white bean ragout they were on was also tasty.
For dessert I finally had the chance to have the much talked about (thanks Phillip S. lol) traditional bread and butter pudding. It was a large square chunk of dense raisin bread in an amazing caramel sauce topped with vanilla ice cream. This thing is insane: the sauce is incredibly rich and decadent and it all comes together incredibly well. I'd come back here for this alone. Also, there was a white chocolate panna cotta, but who cares really because: BREAD PUDDING.
The wine pairings were great: light white wines with the fish, heavy reds with the beef, and sweet dessert wines with the pudding and panna cotta. Overall, a very satisfying and delicious meal. 
I'll make the trip here in the future...if only to have more bread pudding."}
{"text":"Very good menu as other reviewers have noted. Service also very efficient, though lacking in warmth and personality. It may be my age but the noise level was too much for me. Why must they design these places with so much cold metal and hard surfaces? Would return for the great food but cannot handle the noise."}
{"text":"Dropped by for a lunch on a Tuesday and it was busy but super packed. 

My party of two opt for soups as appetizers. We got the mushroom soup and the soup of the day which was a Mexican inspired soup with beans, tomato and tortilla chips. 

For mains we got the short ribs and fries and the special of the day which were the fried pickerel tacos. 

The short ribs and fries were disappointing as the meat looked very tough and dry. There was also an overpowering amount of fries that came with the short rib. 

The tacos were decent but I thought it lacked a salsa or sauce. The taro chips that came with it made the dish overall seem very dry and like it was lacking a side. 

For dessert we opt for the jump white chocolate cheesecake and the daily special which was a chocolate mousse with chocolate curls and brownie bits. The cheesecake was very light but I didn't quite enjoy the cherry sauce that it sat on top of. 

Overall, an enjoyable experience at this O&B restaurant but likely won't return for a while."}
{"text":"I've only been here for lunch and after work drinks / snacks. I work in the area and went to Jump for a business lunch recently. The food was not good.  It was like they had the dishes ready and sitting under a heat lamp, waiting to be served. Our food came out very quickly after ordering, was rubbery in texture and didn't taste all that great.  I don't think anyone at our table of 6 finished their meal.  Really disappointing. There are much better restaurants in the area..."}
{"text":"** This review is based on the Summerlicious preset menu **

My menu selections were the following:

- ANDALUSIAN STYLE WHITE GAZPACHO
 The gazpacho was fresh, flavorful with a hint of heat. Different than the expected tomato base gazpacho I've had many times before- this was an interesting take on a timeless spanish soup that I would recommend to others.

- BBQ SUSTAINABLE B.C. ALBACORE TUNA
 Intended to be seered- this dish was served overcooked. Even the most discerning eye could possibly mistake the tuna for chicken. The tuna was served on a bed of spinach accompanied by a rubbery grilled king oyster mushroom. Overall the dish was overcooked and tasteless.

- CANNOLI 
 The proud pastry of Italy... unfortunately this version tasted like a defrosted grocery store variety. The dessert was served with a tart lemon curd garnish and crushed pistachio. (I wished I had chosen the brownie option).

The service however was spectacular; waitstaff very attentive and restaurant manager making rounds to the patrons ensuring a positive dining experience.

Overall I would say that the Summerlicious menu was disappointing and for those who were dining at Jump for the first time- it might be their last."}
{"text":"I went here for an anniversary dinner with my boyfriend. The service was absolutely amazing, all be it embarrassing sometimes :) When making the reservations online (which is always a huge plus in my books) I guess my boyfriend had put that it was for an anniversary. When we arrived the hostess was very friendly and nice, she took our coats and wished us a happy anniversary. Our waiter was very nice, knew the menu very well and was very thoughtful (my boyfriend accidentally dropped his fork, and the waiter came out of nowhere with a new one literally in 10 seconds). The only complaint would be how close the tables were. It was hard to not eavesdrop on our neighbours! And also hard not to comment on them (we're big people watchers and usually make comments about those around us...I know we're horrible people)

The food was great. I had the crab cakes to start. The were very flavourful, with great toppings and extras. I only wish that their had been more cilantro in them as I thought that kick of flavour mixed with everything else was what made them. Also they were a little 'wetter' (more mayo mixed in) then I would prefer, but overall they were good. My boyfriend had the fois gras to start. It was AMAZING. Perfectly seared, very flavourful and served with great accents. I would say it was the best thing we had. I had the special for dinner, a huge rib-eye steak with asparagus and blue cheese butter with a side of the pan seared wild mushrooms. The steak was great (but actually too big to finish) and perfectly cooked, but I wish there had been more to the dish. The blue cheese flavour was too subtle for my liking, I think when you order blue cheese, you want a punch of flavour. Also I wish it had been served with a starch like mashed potatoes. The wild mushrooms had great variety, but didn't have any flavour beyond their natural (I don't think they were even seasoned) with would have been nice. My boyfriend had the mushroom gnocchi. The handmade gnocchi were super yummy and melted in your mouth beautifully and the creamy mushroom sauce was full of flavour. The portions were all very large but we saved room for dessert. For dessert I had the toffee creme brulee and my boyfriend had the icees (mango, blood orange, and raspberry sorbets). Both were good, but the embarrassing thing was they came out on a long plate together with a lit candle and in chocolate \"Happy Anniversary\" written. When I had seen the plate leaving the kitchen I actually said to my boyfriend \"That's always so embarrassing when restaurants do that. Please never have a restaurant ever, ever, ever sing me Happy Birthday!\" and then the plate came to our table. At least they didn't sing and it was just one server, not a crowd. The Shiraz wine we ordered was super yummy (although expensive) and went well with our meals. The wine list is extensive, and definitely not cheap. 

Overall, amazing service, great food, good atmosphere. I would go back again, but it's not the place we'll go every year for our anniversary. I definitely wouldn't call it a cafe though!"}
{"text":"I went here for my birthday tonight. I had the most amazing time!
We were greeted with a friendly smile by the hostess and she offered to take our jackets to coat check. After we sat we were greeted by our very friendly waiter who recommended some wines for me and my boyfriend. I decided to go with a pinot grigio. It was perfection.
We also were given a glass of ice water that was filled up before it was even empty without having to ask. As the waiter came around to our table he recommended some savoury dishes. We decided to order the Antipasto for appetizer. The antipasto was outstanding. The cheese that was served was a great addition. One hard cheese and one creamy cheese. Along with a spicy avocado spread. 
For our main course my boyfriend ordered the flat iron steak. He said that it could of been better, but it was cooked to perfection (medium-rare). I ordered the prosciutto wrapped lamb. It was to die for! And so tender. It was stuffed with spinach, pistachios, and dried cranberries. I would definitely order it again. Throughout our meal we were greeted by the manager who wished me a happy birthday on behalf of himself and the restaurant. Throughout our meal we were brought a special bruschetta platter, compliments of the chef. 
For dessert we ordered the special which was a smore. Homemade graham cracker with an oven baked brownie, homemade marshmallow, with toffee brittle. And for an extra touch they wrote happy birthday in chocolate on the plate and added a candle. 

The restauruant atmosphere itself was great. Lively, as it was a friday night, but very controlled by all of the staff. Every waiter walked by very attentive and had a smile on their face. Our waiter Patrick was exceptional. I would definitely go back just for the fact that he was by far the most knowledgeable, professional, and friendly waiter that I have every experienced at a restaurant. It was my 21st birthday and a great one at that thanks to Jump! I would recommend this restaurant to anyone! Rave reviews all around!"}
{"text":"3.5 stars.

I like this restaurant, and I wish I could like it even more. 
Depending on what you order, some things are better than others. 
I came for my birthday earlier this year (not my first time), and I had a quinoa/chicken dish I believe, which was very satisfying, and I tried my friend's risotto, which was also really good. However, the time before that I ordered a burger for lunch, which came with foie gras, that I removed (overkill!!!) and the burger was way too salty and oily; too salty to eat. I sent it back, and they were apologetic and glad I told them, and remade the burger. Sadly, it was the same :( (maybe the patties they ordered were over salted to begin with), but they did sent a complimentary side of fried shrimp. I couldn't finish the burger, and I didn't have the heart to complain about it again and ask for something else. I also felt extremely nauseous afterward, due to how oily it was.

They make a killer B-52 coffee, however, I've had it be too cold at times, and they've had to remake it. The way they make it also depends on the bartender. The first time I came, I was blown away by how the three different alcohols formed three separate layers in the cup, based on their densities, and you could feel and taste this separation on your tongue through the straw. It's not always made this way (sometimes it's mixed), but it is always good if its hot. They did re-make it without a problem when asked. 

The interior and layout is fantastic, and adds to the atmosphere and overall experience. If the food lived up to how the restaurant presents itself (upscale, trendy), it could get a full 5-star rating.

Bonus: parking is just $2 when you eat at the restaurant (underground, and lots of spots), after 5:30 pm Mon-Sat, with ticket validated."}
{"text":"Came here for Winterlicous on date night. I chose Jump because their Winterlicious menu sounded appealing. There is an underground parking lot in the building and the restaurant offers a voucher for $2 parking. The lot is accessible on the north side of Wellington just west of Yonge. Make sure you take a ticket rather than putting in a credit card when entering the lot so the voucher can be redeemed. 

When we got into the restaurant for our 7:30pm reservation, it was busy with a low-lit, classy ambiance. We were asked if we wanted to hang up our coats and were given a hanger tag, and proceeded to our table.

Our server was very friendly and attentive. We both ordered the Pear and Rosemary Collins cocktail, which is featured for Winterlicious, and it was very tasty and on the sweeter side. I had the salmon and tuna melt for my appetizer, chickpea cabbage rolls for my main, and toffee brownie for dessert. My favourite dish was the cabbage rolls, which were very tasty. I particularly liked the texture of the dish. The appetizer and dessert were just okay. The melt was tasty, but it lacked complexity that I was hoping for. The dessert was my least favourite. I love brownies, but this one fell short. I would have liked it warm and more airy with less toffee. Overall, the food was just alright. Not bad, but not great. I would rate it 3.5 stars."}
{"text":"My first experience for dinner at this place was good, however! I returned for lunch with my mom, stepdad and boyfriend on the day of my university graduation to celebrate. What a huge disappointment. It was like a completely different place! The food was cold, and my boyfriend and i ordered 2 different pasta dishes which ended up being identical in the bland, luke warm pesto sauce they were made in. Only diffetence was 1 or 2 veggies and the type of noodle. I honestly think they just scrounged up what was left over after the big lunch rush that they get from the business crowd. But it wasnt even late!! It was like 1230. In addition they made us wait at the door for quite a while saying they were loooking for a table. Then when they let us in the restaurant was EMPTY except for 1 or 2 other tables. I think they wanted us to leave because we werent business people? Wtf! But we were dressed nicely since it was the day of my graduation. I found it very discriminatory and rude. Then when we were seated we gad very poor and condescending service. I wish i could turn back time and celebrate that special day somewhere else. I was so disappointed because i enjoyed dinner there with my boyfriend about a year earlier and it was great. I dont think you could pay me to go back now. What a bunch of snobs. They acted like we were inconveniencing them gor coming after the lunch rush. Ummmm well then close the restaurant!!!!!!! Thats what a lot of restaurants do. They close for a short period to prepare for dinner service. I checked the restaurant hours after this experience just to make sure and we were well within operating hours!! So why so rude?? I really hope the manager sees this and tells his staff that there's other customers besides those who are there for business lunches who deserve respect too. I felt embarassed for bringing my family to a place with such bad service. Never again."}
{"text":"I had high expectations from Jump because of Canoe, but i thought it was just good/ OK, definitely not fantastic, which is too bad. 

Service was good, location is central but extra boring in an office building. 

The 6 of us shared oysters (fresh, sweet PEIs), foie gras was seared perfectly, medium rare tuna was..not the best i've had. It was a little thicker and tougher than I'd have liked. 

I had the scallops, which were a disappointment. 
They were not seared properly, no crusty sear; it was kinda soggy and not very tasty. 
The chorizo that came with it was definitely not a chorizo; it was a normal somewhat peppery sausage. I'm not convinced that Canadians do Mexican well. 
The kale was perfect; that was pretty much the best thing on that dish
Mushroom as a side dish was yummy

Molten Choc cake was good; but again, it was technically correct and good but not mind-blowing"}
{"text":"This place is pricey but totally worth it, all the entrees are to die for and the dessert? Even better! The deep fried cheesecake is a MUST, totally I love with it!"}
{"text":"I had the Truffle Ricotta Gnocchi with mushrooms, which was great. I've tried gnocchi before, but this was the first time that I enjoyed it. The texture of the gnocchi was light and smooth. The only complaint I have was that it was a bit salty for me. I got the smaller portion and a side of sweet potato fries. The fries were good, but I have had better. The smaller portions are great because if you want an appetizer or a side it is good if you don't want too much food. However, despite the smaller portion size I couldn't finish everything.

My friend had onion rings & pasta. The golden onion rings were crispy, and the beer batter gave it great flavour. The bread basket they gave us with the tomato dip was delicious. The service was great and the staff friendly and efficient. The atmosphere and the decor was really nice. I would definitely come back. Next time I want to try a dessert."}
{"text":"Was here on a business lunch while in Toronto. It was a late lunch, around 1pm, but Jump was still, well... jumping. If you're looking forward to trying the rotating daily special, make sure you arrive before 12:30pm, or else they will likely have run out for the day. Those of us looking forward to trying Wednesday's burger special were disappointed.

However, we all ordered the steak sandwich as our Plan B, and it was a more than welcome substitute. Sometimes I love or hate sweet potato fries depending on how they are prepared by a restaurant -- I have to say I very much enjoyed these. A few of us also tried the juice of the day, which you could tell had the appearance and taste of fresh ingredients.

Service was quick and attentive -- we were in and out of lunch in less than an hour. Great turnaround."}
{"text":"I came here for a belated Valentine's dinner with my wife last week and we were sat by the manager (I think she's Polish) when we entered the restaurant. You can really tell that she loves what she does as she smiled the whole time she was talking to us.

We sat next to the window in the restaurant, the restaurant was quite busy so we were happy with our table. Our server came to the table and explained the menu to us, he was well versed on the dishes and (as my wife has a lot of allergies) was able to communicate well with the Chefs to make her dining experience a great one. We had the Tartare and Oysters to begin, then i had Steak Frites and my wife had crab ravioli with squash puree. 

We were treated to another pasta dish from the chef because we were celebrating V Day late, I thought that was a nice gesture. 

Upside(s): Great Decor, amazing service and awesome food

Downside: The hot sauce that comes with the Oysters is unbarebly spicy

I will, for sure come back here for a special occasion like Valentine's or a birthday in the future."}
{"text":"For some reason this restaurant seems to get the middle managers all excited.  It serves foods on plates that feel cold from the fridge or freezer, with pasta that tastes as if it was merely thawed a few moments ago.  The staff is condescending because of course that's how you make let people know they're dining in a faux high end restaurant."}
{"text":"Another Oliver and Bonacini restaurant...what's new?

I came here with a large group for a birthday celebration last Friday night. The receptionist was very courteous and were lenient with time modifications. When I got to the restaurant, it made more sense as it was quite deserted for a Friday night. There were about 5 other tables that were seated between 8:30 PM (when we arrived at the restaurant) to 11:00 PM. 

I was pleased with how multiple servers were assisting us instead of designating the responsibility onto one individual. However, I found it interesting when I was comparing the service my table was receiving versus the service other tables/couples were receiving. It was evident that we certainly weren't a priority, and rather we felt unwanted (this was an observation noted amongst several party members). 

As for food - it was, like what my rating suggests, A-OK. I ordered the gnocchi. The gnocchi consistency was a little off. The pasta tasted too flour-y and starchy instead of fluffy and soft. The sauce was mediocre. A joke that went around the table was that the pasta sauce for my gnocchi and my friends' mushroom lasagna was the same as the two soups one of my other friends ordered. Note, he ordered a tomato-based soup and a mushroom-based soup. 

Pros:
I loved the ambiance and their patio however, this is not a place I would come back solely for food. It's great for the social scene and chit chatting. Also, parking is very convenient - enter the public parking garage just west of Yonge/Wellington. Parking is $2 after 5 PM upon validation at the restaurant."}
{"text":"While I would certainly hate to take money from the servers by dissuading you from going here, the management at this establishment makes the servers pay for the credit card use fees of their clients.  I have never heard anything so ludicrous in my whole life.  This is a policy that has to change before I ever step foot in Jump or one of their sister restaurants.  If you go, please use cash, and put more money in the server's pocket."}
{"text":"Luckily my birthday lands smack in the middle of Summerlicious, and get treated to some nice places around the city for the week.  

Some how Jump ends up being a spot I go to once a year, and well beggars can't be choosers and who am I to turn down a free meal?  But overall, for the price (well not mine), I never find it up to snuff.  In fact, I really don't see the difference between Jump and places like Moxie's or Joey's (food wise).

This night I had the Crab Cake, Korean Short Ribs and a chocolate cake.  Everything was heavy handed with the salt, to the point it was almost inedible.  Our waiter, as nice as he was, was super busy tied up due to the Sum'lish, and we had to ask for butter 4 different times because it never got there.  Each time we'd ante up the amount.  \"Can we get some butter please?\", 5 minutes later, 2nd time \"Could we get a pound of butter?\", another 5 minutes later, 3rd time, \"Could we get 5 pounds of butter?\" and the last time \"Could we get all the butter you have in your fridge?\".  We were light hearted and it was all jokes, but we were still annoyed.

Anyways... meh.

I get up, and this place gets me down.
I don't really like to jump, because the waiter goes round and round
And I know, just how he feels.
You've got to roll with the punches to get to what's real
Oh you can't see me standing here,
I'm getting ready for a foodie scene and it ain't the worst that you've seen.
Oh can't you see what I mean ?

Might as well not jump. Jump !
Might as well not jump.
Don't go ahead, jump. Jump !
Don't go ahead, jump."}
{"text":"It was only last week that I was here for my birthday dinner, courtesy of fellow Yelp Elite Karl R.  Earlier this week, I came with 2 co-workers for their Summerlicious lunch.

Upon entering we noticed that each table already had bread baskets sitting out in the open.  Minor detail but it only made me assume that the bread we were about to consume was going to be stale.  

I ordered the Wild & Tame Mushroom Soup made with 6 different kinds of mushroom and it is specifically highlighted that the soup is made sans cream or butter.  The soup was quite good, with the nice nuttiness and earthy taste of the blend of mushrooms.  My dining companions both had the Peekytoe Crab Cake.  I noticed there was a discrepancy in the tint of the batter - one seemed like it was fried in fresh oil, while the other seemed as if it had been fried in thousand-year oil.  The crab cake was served with a cucumber-dill salad and creole remoulade sauce.  I got to sample a piece, and thought that it was quite tasty.  The lump crab meat mixture was held together nicely with a creamy texture.

For mains we all ordered the Pulled Pork Sandwich w/ Coleslaw and Chips.  I was totally not expecting actual (kettle) chips to show up on my plate - but sure enough it did.  The coleslaw was pretty dull and boring and lacked any real flavour.  I have never had a pulled pork sandwich before, but I thought that the sandwich bun was quite tasty, and that the pulled pork was nicely seasoned with a barbecue sauce and caramelized onions.  However, the 2 ladies I dined with, who have had more than their fair share of pulled pork sandwiches said that the one at Jump was awful - so awful that one of the ladies didn't get past 2 bites.  

For dessert I ordered the Butterscotch Panna Cotta.  Although it is advertised to be served with salted caramel, all I got were big salt flakes sprinkled on top of a plain panna cotta, with a butterscotch drizzle.  The salt flakes really gave you a hit of sodium upon contact with your tongue - something I wasn't expecting of a dessert item.  With that said, the panna cotta was extremely creamy, and I absolutely loved the dollop of vanilla spice sweet cream that came with it.

The other ladies ordered the Lemon Sour Cream Cake w/ lemon curd & blueberry sauce as well as the Amaretto Chocolate Marquise Cake.  The Lemon cake did not have a blueberry sauce, it was just served with 2 blueberries.  One of the ladies lamented that she wondered whether the lemon curd was out of a jar because it was so sweet.  I, myself quite enjoyed the lemon sour cream cake as I felt the cake base was airy and light and not overly sweet and went well with the lemon curd.  The chocolate Marquise cake is not something one should brave without a coffee or tea as it is an extremely rich dessert!

Verdict:

A few minor errors were made (e.g. cocktails coming out after appetizers were served, not asking if we wanted coffee or tea with dessert).  The thing that really put us off was when we found the bottom of one of our dessert dishes covered in gunk.  It made us wonder just how clean our dishes were... All in all for $20 during Summerlicious I would come back again - but not if I had to pay full pop.  The crowd is older, and it wasn't all that busy considering it was lunch time AND Summerlicious at the same time.  Perhaps a sign that this is one of the \"has been\" restaurants in the financial district."}
{"text":"Last minute Monday motivation, I've decided to go for Winterlicious. Service was very nice and friendly. From the time you walk into the door, they ask if your coat need to be hanged and if you have been served. I didn't make a reservation as I couldn't find one on Open Table, they accommodated me and sat me on the bar. Again even dining at the bar, the service was great! 

For the appetizer, I've ordered the Lobster Bisque. I think the orange sour cream was way to over powering, which made the soup too sour. I prefer a thicker consistency where I can taste a few bites of lobsters. 

Moving on to the main course, the Olive-marinated Fogo Island Cod. I am a huge fan of Fogo Island Cod. Flavour was good. Except I find the fish a little dry inside. 

Dessert: Bourbon Toffee Brownie. Must eat it with the vanilla creme fraiche. Even then it's a little too sweet. 

Overall a 3.5 stars. Happy with the service and ambiance!"}
{"text":"I was spoiled with Bymark for lunch and Jump for dinner today. I must say, one cannot get enough of Mark's cooking. 

I have always enjoyed Jump since the day they opened. Noting has changed."}
{"text":"Very pricey for the quality and ambience. Decent portions but plating lacked consistency and menu was nothing memorable. The servers were very nice but felt like this was more in line with an average hotel restaurant."}
{"text":"Great place to have lunch! Beautiful atmosphere and loved the food. Service is great, friend and time appropriate. I will definitely be back to have the tuna tartar!!"}
{"text":"Fellow Elite Karl, when's the list for Men friends arriving?
Not greedy, just a simple White Chocolate Cheesecake[1] will do.

I don't want to sit near the front entrance either.
Sit me where there's Skylight, so I can watch Birds poop.
Can I tell them I'm Karl R so I can get the VIP table?
I went for Dessert but the Dining Room looked so much Klassier.

{"text":"Came here tonight (Friday) for Winterlicious.

Reservations were made on-line through Open Table - always a plus in my books as I hate having to call in then having to leave a voice message and then waiting for a response (you get the picture).

Service was really good ... although, Dining Companions and I were convinced that our server was faking a British accent a la Madonna.

This is where Jump lost its star count : the food.

Starter - Ontario Buffalo Mozzarella ... it was actually pretty good. Light with an oil based dressing. The beets and candied pecans added to the salad.

Main - Grilled Salmon ... meh. The lemon aioli was not necessary as it didn't add anything to the salmon. 

Dessert - Chocolate Cheesecake ... meh. I've had a lot better.

I'll be okay if I don't come back.
Not to say that I'd pass an opp to eat here again.

Solid three stars."}
{"text":"I came here for the first time on Saturday night for a dinner party with a group of 8. Sophisticated and yet surprisingly comfortable atmosphere. Our server and the whole staff were very warm and down to earth. Great selection of cocktails. Loved my northern lights cocktail. We ordered tuna tartar and  scallops and bacon for appetizers. Tuna was nicely done sashimi style with subtle flavors and good portion. Scallops were huge and slightly under but solid. There is a huge room and wall of wine on display. We had the Chianti La Piuma and it went so well with our meal. Most of us ordered steak as the main. I had the surf and turf, the Saturday special and it was delicious. They accommodated my substitution for vegetables and additional broccolini. I am reminded why it is definitely better to eat steak at a restaurant rather than attempt to cook it at home. Beef tenderloin was a perfect medium. Others got braised short rib at my table and it got rave reviews. Big portions. For dessert I had the cheese plate. Nice pairing of hard and soft cheeses. Loved the 4 year aged cheddar. At the end of our meal we moved to the drink bar and lounge area and it was perfect. No need to walk or drive to another establishment. This place has it all. It was not overly busy on a Saturday night just the right percentage of patrons to make it a relaxing dining experience. Several families here as well as adults looking for a night out.  Overall excellent lounge and restaurant consistent with the Oliver Bonnacini experience. The parking validation completes the experience and makes it worthwhile to come downtown on a Saturday night."}
{"text":"I decided to write my review before selecting my rating...I am struggling between 4 or 5 stars.

I dined during Winterlicious, I started with the Buffalo Mozzarella Beet Salad, not what I expected but still delicious. Next I had the Butternut Squash Ravioli. BEST THING OD LIFE. It melted in your mouth it was so good. This is the reason why I am struggling with my star review. Lastly I had the Hazelnut and Pralines Cheesecake. Also very good. 

The two down sides were 1) I was sat a poor table. I was seated right by the bar, the waitress explained to us that they were expecting 500+ people and was going to break their record, so I understand it was busy. 2) For a high end restaurant their bathrooms are horrible. They need to update those ASAP.

Our waitress Lindsay was amazing... so because of her great service I will rate this place a 5. I will def be back!!"}
{"text":"I was finally able to try this popular, newly renovated restaurant all thanks to their attractive summerlicious menu. JUMP is located conveniently (for me at least) in the heart of the Financial District, with entrances just off of Wellington and Bay or through the commerce court courtyard (where the Running Room used to be).

The summerlicious lunch menu was $20 for 3 courses, and in my opinion had the most interesting and appealing options out of the neighbouring restaurants that also participate in this annual event. 

Since I've never been to this restaurant before I cannot comment on whether or not the renovations that took place were an improvement on its appearance. On first impression, I did find the decor very modern, spacious, and clean. I also found the dress code to be business casual although I don't think they will stop you at the door if you are wearing jeans.

Often times at summerlicious events I experience long wait periods in terms of service but I was pleasantly surprised that everything went smoothly and our courses were served within a reasonable time.

Appetizer:
Tomato Tarte
(Clover Roads tomatoes, fresh ricotta and Rosewoods Estate organic honey)
Fresh and tasty. I loved the bread as well as the tomatoes! Be careful though as there are some slivers of hot peppers in this dish so expect a bit of a spice kick!

Main:
Crab BLT
(brioche, bacon, crab, vegetable chips)
I don't think the veggie chips  served on the side were house made. Most likely they were store bought (I could be wrong) which is fine as they were still delicious. The crab BLT was humongous! Very filling for lunch and also very tasty. Love the combination of crab and oh so crispy bacon. Overall, a great sandwich and will likely go back again just for this main alone.

Dessert:
Cannoli
(pistachio and lemon curd)
Also a very large portion. Tasted fresh although they could have toned down the lemon curd to balance out all the flavours.

Overall, I think you are getting your money's worth for the quality of food they serve (in terms of summerlicious menu). The portions are also a decent size for a lunch meal. The service was great - our waiter was very attentive and as I stated earlier each course came out at a perfect time. Great experience and I will definitely return again soon."}
{"text":"First time coming here with a date few nights ago.

Hostess was really nice, offered to take our coats into checking but we kept our jackets. The only problem I had with this place was the seating arrangement. The tables in the main dining room were awkwardly too close to each other, its like having dinner with 4 with 2 people on your side that you didnt know lol. So we asked to get a more private, quiet seating area and were moved to the right side of the restaurant near the bar, way better. The bartender was our server, she had good knowledge on the wines and recommendations for the pastas. I forgot what my date had but I got the crab cakes, they tasted amazing ( i already checked in and left a tip about them but im just going to write them again because they tasted soooo good)
So moist and tender, cut really easily with the butter knife, the corn and lil toppings around and above where the perfect touch. My long island iced tea actually tasted like a legit one, equal amount of liquor and iced tea yay! The cappuccinos we got towards the end, they tasted okay. I enjoyed the biscotti that came with it more then my coffee. 

Overall, nice decor, good looking people and great servers!"}
{"text":"I've seen the sign for Jump cafe so many times. I kept envisioning it as a little cafe with a couple chairs,  coffee from thermoses, plastic-wrapped sandwiches, that kind of thing.

Nope, I was totally wrong. Jump is an upscale restaurant. Its part of the Oliver and Bonacini chain. I came on a weekday evening with a large group. The place was busy-financial district crowd, lots of suits. I really liked the display of wine bottles along one wall as you walk in. We initially waited around in the bar area while our tables were prepared. The service was friendly and we got drinks within 5 minutes. 

I'd describe this place equatable to...Earl's, Milestones, the Keg, that sort of thing. I think the crowd also helped make it a more upscale atmosphere. There is alot of seating. We lucked out and were seated in their meeting room...which held around 15-20 of us at one table. It was gorgeous!!

On this occasion I had my usual gin and tonic, and the mushroom soup. The were both delicious. Their menu was a good range, from pasta, to burgers, to steak. They also had some daily specials and wine pairing suggestions. From what I could tell from everyone else's meals, serving sizes were generous and they were pleased with the flavouring. Of note, the vegetarian bowl was a success with those who ordered it. I'll have to come back and try it out!"}
{"text":"Classy interior and crowd, expensive, and standard downtown Bay St food (think Italian), so only 3/5 stars overall.

Food 3/5 - Nothing \"wrong\" with the food quality or taste, but also nothing special. Portion sizes are reasonable meaning that no, you don't get a 4-serving size pasta like you would at an Italian diner, but you should leave here feeling just right. Complimentary bread comes with every meal and their bread dip/spread (combo of something tangy, olive oil, and BV I think) I enjoyed! More dinner menu options here than at Mercatto, etc, and a few vegetarian options are available although the mains are mostly meat/fish heavy. Daily specials are also available. 

BYOW available! But have to pay $30 corkage fee, boo.

My vegetarian partner ordered an entree-sized ricotta gnocchi ($24), which like all their pastas was handmade. The portion size was not enormous - was just right. Hence, I wouldn't recommend ordering their appetizer size pastas since that would be too small. I ordered the wild pacific salmon ($29). The salmon was quite large and one side was deliciously crispy. This dish also comes with small shelled clams. Kind of bland, would not highly recommend.

Value - $$$ for sure. Even starters were ~$20. Don't come here regularly unless you can afford it. Never come here on a student budget.

Service 5/5 - Very polite and professional! Glass was always refilled promptly. 

Venue 3/5 - Big, pretty ceiling lights and sky windows. Loud though because they have a lot of customers (but we didn't have to make a reservation), hard to hear across the table at times. Tables were fairly close to each other, so not much space particularly when the restaurant is crowded."}
{"text":"This place never failed to impress my guests and exceed expectations.  
A business lunch or friendly dinner I have nothing to complain about. 
Latest experience was new year eves dinner. 
The set menue was perfect,  the selection was put together from appetizers to desserts to satisfy everyone.  The price was more reasonable than expected for that particular night and compared to same price bracket restaurants.  
The huge surprise was the portions.... When you pay less than $100 for a 4 course set menue in a 5 star restaurant and everyone in your party can barely finish the dessert,  then the portions are very generous.  The steak that partner had and the lamb I had were beyond  amazing. 
Love this place"}
{"text":"My first time here for lunch in probably over 6 years.  And it was worth the wait.  Thank goodness for Summerlicious - what a way to experience really great restaurants at a more reasonable cost.

The summer salad was light and refreshing.  The shredded asparagus was a very nice change from how I normally eat asparagus. A very tasty way to get your 7 to 10 servings (well a serving or two).  The crab BLT was a great sandwich; the bun was nice and airy and did not take away from the sandwich content, the crab very tasty and who can go wrong with bacon.  The vegetable chips were crisp and very tasty. I don't know how they prepared them but they were much more delicious than standard potato chips, not that I'd expect that from JUMP.

The finish touch was the double chocolate brownie.  Rich, decadent chocolate, will leave you leaving the restaurant with a smile on your face."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner on a Saturday night, they mixed up my reservation ( I made it for 8pm but they thought 7.30pm) but to be fair I was being difficult and have to change it 2 times. Very cozy, financial district decor, the chairs were plush, the lighting was pretty and it just felt like money inside, as if I should be dining with Don Draper. 

We ordered 1 meal off the summerlicious menu ($35 dinner), and that was a really big disappointment. The pig and parsley terrine was soft and good but the bread and the chichorron that came with it felt stale and was chewy. You can tell its been pre-made and sitting out for a while because the sauce had built a thin film on top. The salmon entree felt cold and the skin wasnt crispy fried. The dessert was the worst part - got the coconut sponge cake - not spongey at all - it was hard as a rock, dry as a brick. For summerlicious I'd stay far far away. 

However, we also order items off their regular menu. The tuna appetizer was good ($19)- but not memorable, the fish itself was good and nice and raw in the middle, but there was an odd spicy sauce that I couldnt figure out what it was. The mushroom soup was ok - at least it came out somewhat warm. The redeeming part of the meal was the $100 - 20oz ribeye for 2 - it comes out on a large platter with potatoes and carrots. It also comes with a bone marrow, which was the best part. The steak was good, wasnt chewy and again came out hot. The tiramisu dessert coffee was good, but felt a bit small and you could finish it in about 5 gulps. 

Our server was ok nothing spectacular, didn't smile too much just average. I may come back again to eat their regular menu again."}
{"text":"Had dinner with 4 girl friends from the moment we arrived we were treated very well. Martini drinks were wonderful.  Amuse-bush was delicious.  Mennonite chicken [evening special] was great as were our apps and dessert.  All the servers were attentive never had to ask for water or wine fill ups.  Parking and coat check were free!"}
{"text":"This is the best place, ever, for a quick dine-in business lunch. Service is incredibly efficient here from taking down orders to keeping your waters filled to processing payments. The food arrives within minutes. It's really a wonderful experience when the staff know what they're doing!"}
{"text":"Good food with nice presentation.  Messed up our order, but were able to fix it in a timely fashion."}
{"text":"Went to jump last night and was quite disappointed. I am well versed in fine dining, and a definite foodie. The soup was one of the nicest I have had, but the rest of the food was over spiced. I had the chicken and my husband had the scallops. The flavours did not fit together well at all. I am a fan of spice and lots of flavour, so when i say over spiced it's pretty serious. 

Also, i have an allergy and ordered food that was supposed to be free of dairy. I was told after it was made that there is milk in the food, and the waitress tried to get me to still take it, a hamburger without a bun (a $25 dollar hamburger, for that matter). That's when i decided to have the chicken, which was obviously rushed because it was pink in the middle. Thought their food quality was excellent, they need a new chef because the food was not great. 

I would not return. There is so much better out there, including all the other O&B restaurants and many many others in the city. 

Recommend: nota bene, crush wine bar, and my fave in the city \"Union\""}
{"text":"My husband had booked a surprise birthday dinner for me at Jump on Saturday. The decor was nice & the atmosphere / ambience also great however there were a few things that made my dining experience less favourable. 

Food: 

Tuna tataki was good , along with the Caesar salad. 

I ordered the Wellington steak ( medium rare) and it came under cooked closer to blue. 

Drinks : 

Two of us ordered the red sangria & they both tasted very different . Also there were no fruits in the sangria & there was more ice than the actual drink. 

Desert : 

We had brought our own cake & was not advised about the plating fee. Usually upon arrival , the host / manager should advise us about the plating  fee or auto gratuities. 

I understand if there is a flat rate fee for plating however they attempted to charge $5 per person . We had 10 guests & $50  to cut a birthday cake is ridiculous. 

A corking fee is only $30 flat rate , I don't understand how they think it would make sense to charge $5 per person for a piece of cake . 

Also, the cake we bought was exceptionally big and the remainder of the cake was not returned to us. The cake feeds 20 & the slices that they had cut were small so there had to be cake left. 

I spoke to the manager on duty respectfully but was not pleased with the way he spoke to me. 

I had brought to his attention regarding the plating fee about not being informed. I don't mind paying a fee but I would definitely like to be advised prior to being charged excessively. Rather than apologizing, he continued to be- little me. 

\" This is a restaurant , all we do is sell food it's customary what do you expect ? All restaurants charge for plating fees\" 

Although I do appreciate the manager excluding the fee, I am extremely disappointed with the lack of customer service he had. 

Also , upon requesting for the bills it took 25 minutes to receive them & another 15 minutes to be billed out. We were a group of 10 ( 5 couples ) , rather than the server asking if we wanted one bill ( which would have been fine ) he billed us separately. This is wasn't a big deal but I think it would have been much easier for the server to have organized the bills by couple rather than seat. 

I personally would not recommend jump but will be open to try another O&B restaurant ."}
{"text":"Jump never fails you.  Haven't been for many, many years and visited over lunch today for colleague's retirement lunch. The ambience is always that great... be it over lunch, happy hour or dinner! Their service is just phenomenal. Our colleague stepped out for a call and they covered it. White glove service, need i say more? 

Their calamari has been the anchor of the restaurant in addition to the decor,their liquor collection. This dish never fails, calamari was grilled perfectly, so was the olives, the tomato and pesto sauce! Love it!"}
{"text":"I came here for a Christmas dinner with friends and the staff were quite nice and accommodating. They have a great setting if you're looking for a more upscale evening with friends and family. But unfortunately that was the highlight of the evening for me.

When it come down to the food and drinks I was underwhelmed. The drinks were average price until you get to the wine list. Every wine by glass seemed to be over priced for the quantity you were getting, in respect it was most much economical to get a bottle of wine and share that instead.

The food was mediocre. A friend and I had split the Sunday Roast dinner for 2 which included a meat platter, salad, bread and 2 pasta dishes for $79. the quality of the meal was good and it was cooked very well, however the pasta seemed to be neglected it was over acidic and below room temperate (seems odd for an italian restaurant) and the salad was not dressed well. For the price point I would have expected a better quality meal, there are several other places in Toronto where you can have a great italian meal for less then $25. If you're busy and unable to do some research into other Toronto restaurants this is a good default place to go. However, I'd say do some research and find another place to go."}
{"text":"The First of many Winterlicious meals lined up for 2014!
Among the Oliver & Bonaccini restaurants, JUMP located in the financial district.
Their service is superb! fast and efficient, the decor is lovely, contemporary and unique especially with its glass cube lamps that hang high from above.
The food in general is on average 3.5-4, based on the winterlicious foods we had, and they're as follows:

Spice Roasted Pumpkin soup: 4/5 pumpkin puree spiced along with a rich creme fraiche in the center drizzled with some pumpkin seeds added a complimentary crunch to this starter. 

Enright Farms Beef Bourguignon: 3.5/5 more of a stewed dish that had most of its flavor in the gravy/both topped bubble and squeak, which in essence is like onions, potatoes served on side with smoked bacon and beef.  The beef lacked flavor..

Traditional Bread & Butter Pudding: 5/5 this truly made up for the whole meal! topped off with ice cream, and mint leaf, rich caramel sauce surrounding the cake was pure BLISS!! so savory!! this dessert was love a first bite....

Overall the place is worth visiting.......once..or twice...."}
{"text":"Always a fan... this place never disappoints... one of my favourite lunch restaurants in Toronto."}
{"text":"Came for winterlicious dinner. Environment is classy, food was okay. Server at the door was very attentive. The main I got was bourbon braised brisket, was very heavy and salty lacking some sides to complement, overall it was okay as I can stand very salty food, just chuck some water. The lobster bisque could not be eaten by itself because of the taste, I had few spoonfuls of it. Dessert was coconut tapioca pudding I find it interesting, looks cool, tasted okay. Some people in our group got the Mac and cheese, since I'm gluten free I didn't venture to try it. Like previous reviews said, who would come here spend $50 to get Mac and cheese?"}
{"text":"I like Jump. I've liked it since the 1990s. It's never really slid. Prices have gone up. Sure. The bar isn't quite the phalanx of power suited lawyers and bankers drinking it up after the market is down that it used to be. There's nothing about it that says romantic.

I had the strip steak this time around. Flavorful with some nice baked potatoes hiding under the steak. We shared fries and onion rings. Jumps one weakness is their dipping sauces/spreads for their fries, onion rings, and bread basket are uninspired.

I'm dinging them a star this time around. Usually Jump has about 2 or 3 people working your table but a couple times we felt we were looking for our waiter. And he missed writing down an item. 

Did engage in a short but interesting conversation about Jeremy Irons and The Borgias. So few people seem to recall the Jeremy Irons horror movie Dead Ringers (http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0094964/). Even trying to sum up the movie is difficult. \"Twin gynecologists to upper class women. Irons plays both. One goes crazy and starts inventing horrific 'devices' for use down there because he thinks women are 'changing'...\" Luckily I brought up the movie after I finished my raw steak."}
{"text":"Absolutely great restaurant! we celebrated our anniversary here and the staff was very friendly. all of our food was done extremely well, we got the bison lasagna and cooked duck. 

The cheesecake is an absolute try, make room for it. 

I would recommend this to anyone celebrating a special day"}
{"text":"I usually love most things O&B, so I was really disappointed when my experience here wasn't great.

The service was very slow and not that friendly.  A colleague of mine and I popped in after a work event.  Winterlicious was on, but nothing on the menu was tickling my fancy.  Unfortunately, due to Winterlicious, the regular menu was significantly condensed.  

I had the wild mushroom soup and the mahi mahi.  Both were okay, but not worth the $11 and $28 I paid for each.  

I don't think I will be coming back to this O&B restaurant.  It's just not worth the money, and I prefer some of their other places."}
{"text":"During a business trip in Toronto, the only women at the training (myself and 2 others) decided to have a girls night out.  I had been doing pretty well with my recent picks so they tasked me with finding a place for dinner within walking distance to the office and the hotel.  Corporate Offices were picking up the tab so money was no object, and when that is not an issue then the sky is the limit.  We had originally intended on going to Canoe but they did not have a table available at the right time and we didn't find the menu all that appetizing, so we checked out their sister restaurant (their owned by the same people) Jump Cafe online and found their menu a little more appetizing.

We hoofed it over there just in time for our 5pm reservation.  In a city as big as Toronto earlier is better for dinner because by 6:30 the places start to get crowded.  We must have gotten there at shift change because we ended up with like 4 different waiters/waitresses, although they all seemed very knowledgeable, friendly, and professional.  I'm not a big fan of modern design but I did like the modern decor here, since it was not overdone.

We couldn't decide on one appetizer so we got 2; Peekytoe Crab Cakes with lemonade fruit tartar sauce and green bean jardiniere, and the Bacon wrapped boneless quail with grille dpineapple and sweet and sour pepper jelly.  I don't know what a Peekytoe Crab is or even if it's a real crab but it was delicious.  The seasoning within the crab cake blended so nicely with the fruity lemon tartar sauce and I am not a fan of lemon.  The quail was tasty too, but the party of flavors within the crab cake were my favorite.

For our entrees; I chose the Truffle Ricotta Gnocchi with northern woods wild mushrooms and porcini cream, while the other 2 ladies chose the Ancho Chili Roasted Halibut with tomato and blue corn tortilla sopa, and avocado lime salsa.  For the pasta dishes you can choose from a large or small portion and since I knew I wanted dessert I chose the small portion, and I was informed by the waiter that it was very rich and very filling.  He was right.  My first thought when the plate was set before me was that the gnocchi looked like plumb grub worms, but once you get past the way it looks it tasted great.  The woodsy mushroom flavor and the creamy cheese filling gave it a very rustic taste which I liked.  The cream sauce wasn't overly thick but it was very rich.  I'm thankful I got the small portion.  Being from Alaska it is against my up-bringing to order Halibut outside the state, but the ladies seemed to rave about their dishes as well.

Last but certainly not least we ordered dessert.  There were so many delectable items on the menu we couldn't decide but luckily for us the Jump Cafe has already anticipated this and had an item on the menu that fit us perfectly; the Dessert Platter for Two.  This divine sampler included; SOMA molten Chocolate cake, White Chocolate Cheesecake double-baked in phyllo with biscottie crust, Grand Marnier Creme Brulee with plum raspberry compote and amaretti cookie, and a scoop of milk chocolate and Tahitian vanilla ice cream.  We devoured that poor platter, sample everything and each of finding something different that we all liked.  The molten chocolate cake was actually rather dark and not very sweet.  For me, my favorite was the cheesecake.  I am not a fan of white chocolate but I am a fan of cheesecake.  I think the thing I liked most about it was the added texture of the phyllo.  

I had always heard of the virtues of Icewine and when I saw it on the menu I decided to try it with my desert.  The waiter asked which Icewine I'd like to try and when I told him I'd never tried it before, he got a twinkle in his eye and a smile on his face and told me \"I know exactly what you should try\" and dashed off.  He presented me with a small glass of amber liquid that resembled cognac.  I took a sip and I was in love with this rich honey-citrus flavor sweet wine.  He showed me the bottle and explained it's something he found last summer and bought several bottles.  I later found out this particular year of Icewine isn't even on the menu and he was kind enough to write it down for me; Cave Springs Reisling Icewine 2004.

Anyway; all in all it was a superb dinning and culinary experience that I will never forget.  I hope to be back on my next trip to Toronto."}
{"text":"This restaurant has been around for a while. It's a good place to go to after work when they have their patio specials. The service is kind of pretentious. Food has never disappointed. Good for business lunch.

{"text":"Went here for dinner during Winterliscious with a reservation.
We were seated promptly after the hostess took some time to find my reservation.
The service was attentive, friendly and professional.
The food was okay, I didn't really like my appetizer and dessert, the entree was pretty good and so was the cocktail. The portion size was decent, I was not full after but I was satisfied.
Overall, I'd say I'm not overly impressed. Not sure if their winterliscious menu differ in quality from their regular menu, so can't speak to that."}
{"text":"Pretty restaurant with padded high-backed seats and plush chairs.  The SUMMERLICIOUS menu was available although they served from the regular menu as well. Had a pint of muskoka detour which was not really a pint, but more like 16oz. 

For appetizer I had the chilled pea soup with shrimp which had good flavor and texture, bit reinforced my previous conviction that I only like my soups hot. The bread and dip they serve in the beginning was not that great,  the bread being cold and the dip basically just a tomato sauce with olive oil.

The lamb was a disappointment. The polenta was mushy, the green olive flavor was overpowering and the lamb itself was small in quantity and taste. I expected more from such a well known and expensive restaurant. I've had much better lamb in greektown.

The coconut sponge cake did not feel much like coconut and was dense and dry in the middle.  Pineapple salsa saved the day but not completely. 

No matter how hard I try I cannot give this place more than 3 stars."}
{"text":"Ordered the burger, it came with the most disgusting fries ever. Over-cooked on the outside, hard on the inside.

Asked for the burger to be medium, it came medium-well. Burger bun was sub-par. Burger ingredients were barely passable: not enough cheese, tasteless tomato, not very exciting sauce. A very mediocre burger.

Salmon ceviche was not marinated long enough, avocado was not ripe."}
{"text":"I was thrilled when my colleagues agreed to let me choose the restaurant for our Toronto dinner.  After narrowing the options down to about a handful, I further zeroed in on Jump, which possessed an extremely interesting menu.  We entered the beautiful, modern space and took in the industrial, manly decor of dark browns and black.  The dining area was sprawling and offered a variety of seating beneath the lofty, high ceilings.

We decided to celebrate our productive afternoon with a bottle of white wine from their elaborate list.  We began sipping the crisp beverage while we munched our way through the bread basket, which included rosemary crisps, foccacia, and crusty slices of artisan Italian bread.  We also ordered starters to satisfy our rumbling bellies.  I began with the Wild and Tame Mushroom Soup.  The fragrant, earthy broth contained at least six different kinds of mushrooms, each putting forth their own signature flavor.  The soup was lean in the sense that it did not contain any butter or cream, yet it was barely strained and contained comforting chunks of its namesake vegetable.  Fresh mushroom and chive slices acted as garnishes, peering out from within the broth.  I absolutely loved the dish.  My co-workers, however, did not find their half a dozen Oysters very fresh.  Even the spiced red pepper dipping sauce, fresh horseradish, cool lemon, and classic mignonette apparently did not do much to enhance the flavor.

My Mahogany Glazed Black Cod entree was perfectly cooked and served with an aromatic Indian blend of curried lentils, both enhanced with sprigs of cilantro and cool mint chutney.  The Veggie Bowl that my colleague had ordered was an Asian-style compilation of cauliflower and Chinese cabbage served over jasmine rice and tossed in a Thai red coconut curry.  The fragrant seasoning really added an unique kick to the traditional vegetables.

Lastly, I found our SOMA Molten Chocolate Cake dessert to be another home run.  The warm, moist pastry was topped with a scoop of vanilla ice cream, a sweet espresso syrup, and fresh strawberries.  It was decadent and rich, but the fruit somehow made it feel lighter.

After all of my effort and dedication to the worthy cause of satisfying our hunger, I was disheartened by my companions' distaste for the meal.  I really did not agree with their sentiments and would still recommend the restaurant for its flavorful food and entertaining atmosphere."}
{"text":"Just OK experience. We went during summerliscious so it is expected the overall experience will be a notch down. The decor definately feels very Bay street corporate and not necessarily high end. The meal was OK not bad not great. Service was good."}
{"text":"This review is specifically for lunch. I've visited this place for lunch with my boss, and co-workers consistently choose this spot for a meal during work hours based on a a few very basic, but dependable factors: the service is super quick, food is consistently decent, and the atmosphere is classy, trendy, yet still super professional if you're coming here with colleagues. It's elegant enough that I'm sure it's just as nice in the evening as well, for a dinner or a date or a meal with friends. 

When you barely have an hour for lunch, but you want to step out for something nice in the Financial District, Jump understands the urgency. They bring your food out in less than 10 minutes, but it's always fresh and carefully prepared. While the delicious factor isn't off the scale, the food is decently above-average and quite good. The lunch menu doesn't have much variety, but there are still some pretty dependable options - I've had the Roasted Chicken Caesar Salad and the Pacific Salmon Main. Both have been classic dishes where you can't go wrong - while they won't make your tastebuds swoon, they aren't terrible either. 

Overall, a reliable spot for lunch in the Financial District for satisfactory food, trendy and sophisticated ambiance, a room full of suits, and a very convenient location just east of Bay and Wellington."}
{"text":"How do you have everything going for you, but fail?  Enter Jump Cafe & Bar.

This restaurant is located in the Financial District and the patio is in a courtyard surrounded by skyscrapers.  It felt comfortable and the buildings shielded you from most of the wind.  The service was amazing and we never had to wait to long for someone to come by if we had a request.  Throughout the night, we were helped by 3 or 4 people and all whom were great.  The dishes were beautifully plated.

Unfortunately, we found a hair in one of our pasta dishes and the sizes of entrees were inconsistent.  The Ahi Tuna entree was bland and the size of an appetizer, while the Porterhouse Steak was too big to finish.  

Overall, the price of what you're paying is definitely not worth what you're getting."}
{"text":"Really beautiful business lunch.   Attentive service, gorgeously presented food, great flavors, nice ambiance.  We took a client here and it was perfect.   The noise level was not so quiet that we couldn't talk freely about business matters, but was not so loud that we had to shout.   Nice lighting and huge windows make even a dismal Toronto weather day seem nice.   And the flavors and textures of my arctic char lunch were fantastic."}
{"text":"Decor was superb. I went there for drinks with a Colleague. Service was quiet good as well. Would definitely go back"}
{"text":"This review is for the outdoor patio experience available in the summer - as part of my Definitive Guide to the T.O. Financial District Happy Hour (list).

Most people wouldn't know that Jump had a patio area since it is tucked in behind the Commerce Court center right between Wellington and King. Nevertheless, the space is a great place to spend a hot summer's day after work (when it is open and staffed).

My absolute favourite part of this place, is the fact that they have Kronenbourg Blanc on tap. This is my favourite summertime wheat beer by far.

The seating arrangement, with bar seating, small high-top tables for 2-3, larger patio dining tables and a comfy group couch section as well.

Don't overlook this place in the summer - it should be experienced at least once!"}
{"text":"Recently attended a smallish party of 30 or so - cocktails and apps.  Wine choices were good and overall food was pleasant.  

I do appreciate the service here.  They have consistently been excellent in my experiences.  Attentive friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"This place is a fine dinning experience with an extensive wine list and many fine options for apps & mains.
I've been here many times.
The food is better than a 3-star, but given the cost I would call it a 3 - I subtract points for high cost if the place is not overwhelmingly good.
The staff and interior are well done.
A safe bet for a nice downtown experience."}
{"text":"I have been here twice, and honestly I don't remember much about our mains, I guess they were not that memorable BUT the complimentary bread with the red dip was the best complimentary dip I have ever had! The dip was made out of tomatoes and red pepper , I think. A diluted version of the dip would make a great soup! I wish they bottled it ! 

I went here for Winterlicous and for a family dinner. I liked the interior and the ambiance fit for any occasion."}
{"text":"Food was OK and nothing to write home about, but I just want to add to the praise for the White Chocolate Cheesecake - it lives up to the hype and I would come again just for that signature dessert.

Also, this place made the best Old Fashioned I've ever had."}
{"text":"Go JUMP! This restaurant is awesome. Not sure about all these \"summerlicious\" reviewers (good thing we didn't listen). Here's some info we didn't know before: they have been recently fully renovated. The place looks amazing, modern yet classy, and their menu is brand new as of a couple of weeks (they changed it right after summerlicious). Patio is still there, an it's beautiful too. Parking: After 5:30pm it's validated and you only pay $2. Very convenient.

Everything we ordered was YUM!!! We started with some complimentary amuse-bouche taro chip, avocado & tuna tartare, then we ordered oysters and scallops. For mains I had the red wine risotto and the hub had the burger. I tried some of his burger and we both agreed it was incredible. This is by no means a burger joint, and you normally don't pay over $20 for a burger, but ... BEST BURGER I've had in Toronto (so far). We finished the night off with espresso and their mini ice cream sandwiches. They were really good too and their coffee is excellent.

It's really hard to knock them down on anything. The server was unbelievably nice and just the right amount of attentive. Their general manager even did a walk around later on and asked how everything was, what we thought of the menu, and if there was anything they could improve on. We couldn't think of anything. I'm so glad we JUMPed in."}
{"text":"One of my favourite restaurants in the Financial District, and of the Oliver Bonancini group. Not as upscale as Canoe nor Auberge du Pommier, but the price reflects that too.

Dishes I love there - Truff le Ricotta Gnocchi and SOMA Molten Chocolate Cake. Both are just soo delicious. The gnocchi is actually made with potato instead of the usual ricotta cheese, so it's a bit heavier than your typical gnocchi but it's soo good. Even when I'm stuffed I can manage to finish every last bite!

I went recently for Winterlicious for lunch, and tho they didn't have any of my favourites on the menu, I did really enjoy the halibut course - it was nice and light with panko crumbs as the crust, which gave it a light taste similar to tempura.

All in all, a solid place with great service and decor. A must if you are looking for food in the area that is consistent and reasonably priced. It's also great for an after-work drink, and they have a nice patio in the summer."}
{"text":"The hubby and I had dinner here to celebrate our anniversary and we were greeted by a very friendly hostess who took our coats (and even helped us put it on before we left...wow!).

Atmosphere:  intimate, good for groups since they have these private rooms, decor is sleek and stylish.  It got pretty busy when 6pm hit, but it was by no means crowded.

Food:  a little expensive but the quality is absolutely amazing!  My husband ordered the special for Thursday which was BBQ Spring Creek Brisket Poutine - the brisket literally melted in your mouth.  The Yukon gold fries were cooked to perfection and the gravy wasn't too salty.  I ordered an appetizer sized pappardelle and lamb osso buco ragu and a side of onion rings with buttermilk dressing.  The pasta is made in house so it tasted really fresh and the sauce was buttery goodness.  The lamb was super tender and just delicious.  The size was a little smaller than I expected but I'm glad I ordered it since I probably wouldn't have finished the entree size.  The onion rings tasted like onion rings to me.  

NB:  order the dessert platter for two - it gives you a little taste of everything for a reasonable price.  Hands down THE best vanilla ice cream I've ever had (Tahitian vanilla).  And the white chocolate cheesecake wrapped in phyllo pastry?  Holy moly.  My taste buds were dancing.

Service:  excellent.  Our waitress was very knowledgeable about everything on the menu and very friendly.  She always kept an eye on us and we didn't even have to flag her down to ask for the bill!

Overall:  good place to go if you're willing to spend a little more for a special night out on the town.  Also good to note that it's pretty central, located in the financial district.  They validate parking!"}
{"text":"Very nice interior and good food but the service was really really bad. I hate writing bad reviews but our waiter took forever to come to our table not once but many many times. He even apologized and said \" I hope you don't think I forgot about you guys\". Well we felt like we didn't exist and for the price we expected better service, we won't be going back."}
{"text":"Not a huge fan of Jump. Its servicable, but not somewhere I would want to pay my own money for. I've been here a number of times over the years and its always a safe bet for a business lunch. Its easy to get reservations and the food is safe. Theres nothing ground breaking on the menu, and everyone can find something to order. 

Got the salmon with soba noodles as a main and the beet salad as a starter. Salmon was okay, a bit over cooked and difficult to eat for a business lunch. The beet salad was pretty good. It tasted very fresh and something I enjoyed. Service here is pretty good just cause its a business clientele."}
{"text":"Amazing service! I love this place!

I was here on the weekend for an office Christmas event. I was just the date and when I arrived I discovered that my date had failed to inform his office/the restaurant that I was a vegetarian.  This freaked me out, as there was no vegetarian option listed on the private event menu. 

However the staff and kitchen were AMAZING! They didn't make me feel like some freak of nature and were completely accommodating to my diet. I ended up with a delicious and well thought out vegan main dish (jasmine rice, lentil salad, chick pea fritters, tahini, and some roasted red pepper sauce - SUPER YUM!!!) and  also they whipped up several vegan appetizers on the spot, even bringing my my own dish of appetizers. Really impressed with the service and food. 

I would absolutely come back here."}
{"text":"I came to jump in mid December with my family and boyfriend for a nice evening out. I had read really good things about Jump and was excited to try out some of the menu items that people had been raving about.

We arrived just before our 6:30PM reservation and sat in the bar and had a drink while our table was being cleaned off for us. They have a very nice bar and a very cool whiskey wall when you walk in. They also have some neat cocktails, so I tried their version of a white russian, with cherry flavors, and it was delicious. If I hadn't been driving, i would have had about four of them over the course of the evening.

We were seated shortly after we received our drinks and headed into the dining room. Some very neat decor here to look at. The place was quite busy, as was expected, but our server was over fairly quickly to take a drink order and provide us with the specials of the day.

After perusing the menu for a bit, I decided to go with the cod croquettes (a daily special) for my appetizer, the mahi mahi for my main and the white chocolate cheesecake for dessert. We were brought bread with (what I recall... not sure) red pepper spread of some kind. Quite good and flavorful, but butter would have also been a nice option.

Our appetizers arrive and my cod croquettes were delicately placed on a bed of tartar-type sauce, golden crispy and fried. They were quite good, the sauce was perfect with them, but I felt they could have used a little bit of a flavor kick. Still, a very good dish that was gone rather quickly. I love mahi mahi and I had high hopes for this dish. i didn't want something super heavy (there was a great lamb special on but it was a large dinner and probably too much food for me) so that's why I picked fish. I was so very disappointed, especially after everyone else kept raving about how good their dishes were. The fish itself was good but nothing special, and it was on a bed of \"organic sprout, garlic fermented stew\" with \"pickled zucchini\". The zucchini made sense and actually made the fish stand up a bit on my tastebuds. But there wasn't much of it to go around for the amount of fish on the plate. Whatever that garlic fermented stew was... well it wasn't. Bland, boring and added absolutely nothing to the dish or the flavor profile. I finished my meal but I was sorely disappointed. Especially after seeing the lamb special, which had a lamb shank and a lamb shepherds pie, which my dad and boyfriend raved about. If I went back, I wouldn't order the mahi mahi. Very disappointing (even now, its making me disappointed).

My parents and brother decided to each get a glass of prosecco with dessert. I ordered a hot tea with my white chocolate cheesecake, which came fairly quickly. Our dessert soon arrived and by the time we had finished, the prosecco still had not. We couldn't get a hold of our server, let alone anyone else so when the manager or front of house manager came by, we said something. He was very apologetic and offered to rectify the situation immediately. My folks are fairly laid back so they agreed and wrote it off as a blemish on the otherwise good meal. They brought four complementary glasses (the manger persuaded my boyfriend into having a glass too) for us to have. A few minutes later, the manager came back to the table with a special dessert just for us - chocolate cookie sandwiches with mocha ice cream inside, a dish not on the dessert menu, and apologized again, noting that this was not the kind of service they usually offered and that he hoped it would make up for it.

Everyone else was pretty pleased as we finished up and paid. I think the restaurant did the right thing and dealt with the issue as best one can. I was just so disappointed with my food that the night really couldn't be saved, even with the delicious cheesecake (which was amazing btw). 

A few things worthy of note - I found this restaurant to be loud, especially so for a nice dinner out with family. Talking across the table had to be done in a louder than usual voice and it kind of ruined the ambiance for me. As well, this is a BUSY location. So if you don't make a reservation, expect to wait! This isn't a quiet romantic place to have dinner for two (in my opinion.

I think I may need to try this place out again to give it another shot at wowing me with the food."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went there Saturday night. I got the BBQ pork chop,  which consisted mainly of the kimchi side,  a small tough pork chop and (literally) 4 small potatoes.  My bf got the half chicken which made much more meat,  but was barely seasoned, and not much sides to remark on. 

While the mediocre food was overpriced, we found the service to be far worse. Just very awkward people  dropping the plates on top of our forks, hitting my shoulder when trying to pick up a glass, water glasses placed off their paper coasters,  and leaving empty bread basket for the entire meal. 

Not worth it at all."}
{"text":"Nice place for appetizers and fancy cocktails on a very urban concrete patio located on a rooftop between towering office buildings. This place screams urban professional. Service is mediocre, presentation is nice and the food and drinks are delicious."}
{"text":"We were in from out of town and fell upon Jump. The service was wonderful and the food was delicious. It was a slow night so it was like we had the entire restaurant to ourselves. The drinks were delicious... I had the Coco Chanel which was incredible, not to sweet either. I tried their soup which Was stupendous. I also had the beet salad which was delicious and ordered the special for dinner which was a mushroom risotto with duck confit; cooked to perfection. The chef came out along with the course to shave black truffles on the top. This was a rich dish in every sense of the word. Every bite was fantastic! The other people in our party also enjoyed every bit of their meal as well. I would highly suggest this restaurant... It's just a tad hard to find the entrance as an out of towner. :)"}
{"text":"Being new to the city, I've only ever heard wonderful things about this stalwart of the Toronto restaurant scene. 

As a fan and patron of other O&B joints in the GTA, my dinner at Jump was a highly-anticipated affair.  And the experience was as fabulous as I expected it to be.

There's plenty of reviews on here about the excellent menu, so I won't get into the intricacies of what we ordered. However, I will say that, as starters, the Bacon-Wrapped Boneless Quail and Pan-Seared Foie Gras were exquisite, while my main of Roasted Half Free-Range Chicken, served on a bed of caramelized onions, capers, cracked green olives, and mascarpone polenta shined in both quality and quantity, compared to the selections of my dining party.

From Jump's excellent wine list, a few bottles of  the 2006 Pirramimma Stock's Hill Shiraz served the perfect complement to our highly-palatable meal.

The staff were friendly, the music selection was très cool, and the ambiance was stellar.

I will conclude by saying that every appetizer, main and dessert, ordered by my group of nine, evoked an unanimous top score on the satisfaction and value for money scale...and was concluded by a definite promise to return."}
{"text":"If I'm lucky, I'm sent downtown to work and it's during summerlicious.  This year, the stars aligned and I found myself with 5 summerlicious bookings.  This was the first as it was really close to the office and it was a quick trek for 3 colleagues and me.  

Perhaps it's the hurried and frantic nature of summerlicious but I really found the hostess on the phone to be really disorganized and a touch indignent.  Sure, you're part of the O&B family and you have the cachet but you're not Canoe so please, hold the attitude... I just want a table for 4.  Once that was done and over with, we treked down to Jump days later and was promptly seated.  The atmosphere is quite nice as it has a lot of natural light from the vaulted glass ceiling.  The space is modern and open.  I really liked it a lot.  The hostess told us that our server will with us in a moment.  We waited for probably 10 minutes before anyone made an appearance.  

The server was pretty energetic and if anything, he seemed to be trying very hard.  Nothing wrong with that but seeing how anxious he acted, it made us feel a bit uncomfortable.  It was more noticeable after we said none of us wanted anything from the drinks menu.  I swore he nearly pouted.  With our summerlicious menus taken away and our orders placed, we were able to take in the surroundings.  It was fairly full (about 80%) but no where as crazed as the person on the phone made it to be. Servers were flowing in and out smoothly from the kitchen to deliver the meals.

Our starters came quickly and I'll admit that I did like the carrot and jalapeno soup.  It had a touch of sweetness from the carrot and it was nicely tempered from the heat of the chilli.  The corn cake was just ok according to my colleagues.  They said that though they noticed the crab, it was mostly corn and other fillers.

Mains came soon after and my Thai spiced salmon was a bit underwhelming.  It was cooked a touch too long and felt a bit dry.  The spices could be stronger as I was expecting more of a punch from it.  Two of my colleagues went for the porchetta and they said it was pretty decent.  One said it wasn't as good as Porchetta and Co but it'll do.  It was a bit tougher and had more chew than he'd like.  

Dessert was light and refreshing.  I got the Passion Fruit panna cotta and everyone else at my table got the chocolate mousse.  Their verdict was that its was good but not great.  

Overall, food was never outstanding but it wasn't offensive either.  Service was decent even though he was 'jumpy' (yes bad pun I know).  Considering the low price of summerlicious, it was a decent meal.  If I paid normal Jump prices, I'd be a bit disappointed."}
{"text":"Pretty good place. Always get quality service, although price is a little high. But what do you expect when dining at one of Toronto's best restaurants. 

Food quality was ok, but not as good as Oilver Bonacini's other restaurants (Canoe, Biff's Bistro). I love those 2 restaurants the most, but now I can say I've been to all 5 of his restaurants now."}
{"text":"Went for Winterlicious. Had a perfect dinner! Tasty, good portion sizes and very nice ingredient combinations (but do not take pork as it is overcooked and dry dry dry, so dry).

Desserts are OK (could really be better). Service is uneven (some attentive waiters, some much less... and of course the one in charge of my table seemed to be the less attentive of all... but others helped with a large and nice smile).

I'd be happy to go back but remain afraid that this place can be very uneven in the quality of food like in that of the service."}
{"text":"Our waiter was super friendly, he spent the time to review everything on the menu with us.  Not saying that I needed that, but still, I appreciate the effort.  

The decor is beautiful, spacious, and elegant.  The place feels like fine dining, but without the high prices. 

There are some expensive items on the menu, but there are also cheaper dishes to choose from if you don't want to spend a lot.  

The quality of food is amazing, makes me want to eat there every night, and I said that when I was eating.  I made a promise to myself that eventually I will eat at this restaurant at least once a week.  We were given a complimentary starter as well, which I really appreciated (although just a small one.)

You should definitely come here, I'll be coming back, and I've never been to a place this good.

Derek"}
{"text":"The huge whisk(e)y selection here is definitely a selling point,  but the food is only okay.  Don't go expecting to be wowed. You won't be really disappointed, but you won't be impressed either."}
{"text":"I love this place.  Trick is... to order food that you can understand goes into it.

The price is high but it has to do with the location and everyone in the financial district is automagically considered ballers.

I know it's a faux pas to have summerlicious and winterlicious here, but i do... guilty!"}
{"text":"Really small menu for lunch, chances are you won't find anything you actually want to eat on their lunch menu. Seems like the dinner menu is much better in terms of variety. Portions are on the tiny side, and I found myself to crave a little more food after I finished - as did several others I had lunch with. 

Ordered the Pacific Salmon which was served with soba noodles...it was tasteless. It tastes like something you should eat if you're on a strict diet. You should also know that the salmon is not fully cooked and left medium rare. I understand this is a new way of cooking salmon but I prefer my salmon fully cooked. I just wasn't satisfied at all with this meal both in terms of flavour and portion.

Wanted to have a cappuccino after, but unfortunately they didn't have lactose free milk. For such an upscale restaurant, that was rather disappointing. The only saving grace is that this is a fantastic location with great decor, comfortable seats, and great service."}
{"text":"Fellow Elite Karl, though I have no interest to be on any of your lists, I definitely on my Hot Yoga Date (HYD)  A-list without even any need to add my name in.

I must be really really omfg HOT after my hot yoga practice when my date suggest to go to Jump with me for a drink or 2. Fortunately, after Jump my date is wise enough to know that I need more than to be impressed. 

The experience is MEH... not romantic... the crowd is way older for our taste... food is overpriced...

Now my HYD is scratching Jump off the to go place to impress..."}
{"text":"Went there for winterlicious menu. Tried the crab cake which was pretty good, better than the beef tataki which was much too thin."}
{"text":"My friends and I decided to have our Summerlicious reunion at Jump! Restaurant this year. The girls are fans of Oliver & Bonacini; I on the other hand, am still reserved after unfortunate experiences at Luma, O&B Canteen and Canoe. The problem is, I have trust issues with Canadian contemporary restaurants' adaptation on cuisines from other cultures. I might be bias, but it is rarely executed properly. It's a TRAP! It's like ordering Angus AAA Tenderloin from a Chinese restaurant. TRAP! TRAP! TRAP!


Appetizer: 
Bread with Roasted Red Pepper Paste 

Warm bread happiness! 

Canadian Rock Crab & Corn Cake: Rock crab and corn with lime and wild leek aioli, daikon and summer beet slaw

We all enjoyed this dish. The dill complimented the crab cake very well. The daikon radish and beet slaw is an interplayed on the bitterness of the root vegetables and the acidity of the dressing.  The textures and the flavors of the dish were extremely well balanced. 


Entrée:
Boneless Jerked Chicken: Jamaican yam and pigeon pea ragù, island pineapple salsa

Two of my friends ordered this dish. I already warned them about crossing the demarcation of cultural cuisines. They didn't listen. Some girls never listen! Tsk tsk! Haha! They practically ordered the equivalent of wanton at a French restaurant or sushi from an Italian restaurant. The chicken was dried with virtually no spice or seasoning. It was bland, real bland. Pass! 

Rosemary Porchetta & Fagioli alla Toscana: simmered cannellini beans, pomodorini and chili garlic rapini 

The simmered cannellini pomodorini was exactly what the desperately dried porchetta needed. The portion was ginorm(ous)! I was actually able to scarf down the entire 2 lb porchetta after doubling down on hot yoga for 3 hours! Unfortunately it was not a testament to the food quality...it was a testament to the brutality of a 40 degrees Bikram yoga practice!

Dessert: 

Hazelnut Milk Chocolate Mousse: Espresso savoiardi sponge and strawberry sauce 
Coconut Rum Cake: Dulce di leche cream cheese icing and mango jam
Passion Fruit Panna Cotta: Ontario wild blueberry sauce and Chantilly cream

The texture is off in my Panna Cotta. The verdict was unanimous, Jump! needs a new pastry chef.
 
Mango Mousse Tart: Chocolate tart with strawberry cookie bits

This was a surprise dessert for us. The mango mousse has no mango flavour. The artificial strawberry cookie bits felt out of place. Verdict, Jump! still needs a new pastry chef. 

Aside from food, Jump! needs to work on their table side romance. The server only briefly touched on one entrée and one dessert; \"this is your jerk chicken with tomatoes on top\", \"this is your hazelnut milk chocolate mousse with a strawberry on top.\" Com'on Jump! Lie to me! \"This is your hazelnut milk chocolate mousse. The sponge cake was infused with organic espresso. We ensured the espresso extraction occurs at 90°C to 96°C. This was a critical process as higher temperatures accentuate bitterness; while lower temperatures accentuate acidity. Pieces of caramelized hazelnuts were sprinkled on the milk chocolate mousse. Each cake was topped with wild strawberry. We lost three men in the forest during our strawberry expedition. Enjoy!\" 

Anyhow, I have no one but myself to blame. Every licious, I would create an Excel-licious document with participating restaurants, reviews and prices. The data is cross examined with Yelp AND Urban Spoon! This year, I was so busy with new beginnings; I neglected my Excel-licious exercise!  Oh well, you can buy good food, but you can't buy extremely delicious borderline immoral juicy juicy gossips! Kidding! It was great catching up with the girls! Every 4 months, I need a gentle reminder on my own blind spot, girls myself included never listen! Haha!"}
{"text":"\"Meh\" is the perfect word for this place. I'm not sure if this is because I came here for summerlicious and the experience may not reflect the average one, but all I could think of was all the cheaper, better restaurants I could be eating at. The waiters are pretentious looking and act accordingly. Service isn't particularly polite either. I got the crab cake and it was decent but overly salty. The grilled korean short rib was alright as well but better than the pork shoulder of some of my colleagues. The only item I would say was good was the sour cream lemon cake. Overall, not worth it at all for summerlicious for dinner at least. I've been doing summerlicious for a number of years now and I felt I got the least out of money from this place."}
{"text":"I came here for a business lunch and was pretty disappointed.  it is very hard to hear in here and I found the service slow, although it was pretty friendly.  The food came out quickly, but my dish of a linguine vongole was shockingly bland (and it was $22!)  While presented nicely, it literally was a pile of cooked linguine, with a few pieces of \"crispy fatty pork\" (their fancy way of saying \"bacon\") and a few clams outside of their shell.  Now I don't know about you, but typically a pasta vongole is probably the most flavour packed item on any pasta list since you cook the pasta in the clam water - but in this case, the execution just seemed... dejected.  Sigh.  I hope if I return again for another meal, the dishes will be a bit more inspired!"}
{"text":"The menu has definitely improved.  Had the Tuna Tartar and a quinoa  and mushroom app.  Both were excellent for the price.

Typical downtown Toronto expense account lunch crowd.  Doubt anyone there was paying their own way.  

The service is fast, you can be in and out in an hour.  Perfect for Toronto, eat and back to work."}
{"text":"Had a lovely Winterlicious lunch at Jump back in January. The food was excellent and service was pretty good. I expected smaller portions, but surprisingly, I was quite full by the end my meal. I particularly loved the honey crisp apple and cranberry crostata!"}
{"text":"3 étoiles c'est peut-être un peu sévère mais bon, c'est un resto trendy comme on en trouve à la pelle dans toutes les grandes villes nord-américaines. Donc la cuisine est bien exécutée, un brin originale mais le lieu manque d'âme et de personalité à mon avis.

J'étais avec un groupe business, j'ai donc pas vu l'addition mais ça devait être trop élevé pour ce qu'on a eu. Et le choix de vin était décevant.

Le service était parfait."}

Place isn't too pricey unless you get wine. Their selection is pretty decent though"}
{"text":"We came here on Friday as part of the \"Jump into Louboutin\" package; it was about 8:30pm and the restaurant was fairly busy but not crazy.

It took 10 minutes for water to arrive, another 20 for the waiter to come take our orders and then another 5 for bread which we had to ask for.
We were two, and shared two mains which they happily split up for us into two courses. We had the Tortelli, which was an odd Chinese meets Italian dumpling, the meat inside was oddly textured but it was pretty yummy overall, though a bit oily and salty. Next was their Prime Rib burger and fries which was really good. We finished with a shared serving of their three sorbets: lime; mango; and blackberry... which were all really good.

Overall, the food was pretty good, but unfortunately shadowed by the slow and poor service."}
{"text":"Yep! Summerlicious dinner for me as well :) it's ooooookkkkkaaay here.... I agree with other reviewers about the food quality here.. it's just a meh. 

Service wasn't bad though! They weren't mean, didn't forget things, and food came on time. We also got complimentary chocolate dessert cups with strawberry mousse and rice krispies. That was reeeallll yummy and beats everything I ate that night.

I don't have much to say about the food.. It was alright. It didn't justify that price though, but for summerlicious I'll let it go.

LOVE THE DECOR! Love that doodle poster on the window. And no the giant lamps don't light up, we asked..."}
