{"text":"Been coming to bellos for over 6 years, and they never disappoint. The sandwiches are all amazing, from the grilled smoke meat to the chicken brie,  the vegetable pizza is the best I have ever had. Highly recommended, its the go to place for lunch when your in the old montreal area."}
{"text":"Not cheap but 1) delicious and 2) more authentic than most run-of-the-mill Old Montreal joints."}
{"text":"Good food but overpriced. I asked about the size of their 3 veggies meal, they showed the size of the container plate, but when I made my order they only skimpily filled half of it. Should be in the $$ rather than $ price-range."}
{"text":"Great place to have a healthy lunch. Salad and veggie choices were good. Love it that they had a TV where I could watch the world cup. Staff and patrons were friendly.  Reasonable prices."}
{"text":"This place is great! Delicious prepared foods, pastas and sandwiches. Gets pretty crowded at high noon, but the line moves quickly so don't be discouraged. Table turniver is equally quick.  Roasted red peper farci with gnocchi and Brussels sprouts was delicious, as was eggplant parm. Not cheap though. $18 or thereabouts for lunch and cookie."}
{"text":"banana bread pudding is amazing. big helping is plenty for two people. no chai tea latte in the menu. dirty chai was an even bigger mystery. the curious barristas came through and made me smile. and according to the wooden info graphic by the steps there is no difference between latte and cappaccino. who knew!"}
{"text":"I really liked this deli they have cool and creative sandwiches, and a nice selection of sides for a great quick lunch or breakfast! Finely a go!"}
{"text":"After a long day of touring Old Montreal, we needed a break. We came across this italian deli and coffee shop. I'm glad we did. The owner and staff  we awesome, very helpful. The sandwiches are fresh prepared in front of you. The coffee was perfect. If I lived in Montreal this would be a regular stop!"}
{"text":"Tasty little deli/Café with nice selections of sandwiches. Everything tasted very fresh- we had a pork sandwich and a itlaian cold cut freshly pressed. Desserts were unique and excellent. Perfect place to stop in for a quick bite."}
{"text":"Amazing staff. The girls who work are so nice. The owner can be a bit of a comedian. The sandwiches are delicious and the carrot cake is a must. Definitely worth the visit."}
{"text":"Che bello indeed! A perfect lunch option in Old Port. The food is fantastic, comforting, tasty and I'd even say indulgent. If you're a member of the Carb Club, their pasta will have you returning faster than you can say spaghetti. There's a great spread of roasted veggies too if you're on your best eating behaviour. The staff is generous and one time there was a bi of a delay with my friend's sandwich so the lovely helper offered him a brownie on la casa (the house). Ain't that nice?"}
{"text":"I've been having the chicken cranberry wrap every single time I eat here and I just can't get enough!    The generous chicken cranberry salad is wrapped in a large green tortilla wrap with pecans and cheese included and then melted on the panini grill.   The result? Biting into this wrap is like biting into a warm delicious hug. The flavors really go well together.  Of the half a dozen times I've had this wrap, it's pretty consistent. There was only one time where they heated the wrap a bit too long. This wrap you gotta try at least once!!!"}
{"text":"Bello's selection is awesome. A lot more choices than most of the other sandwich shops in the area, and it's not just sandwiches it's salads and cooked entree's as well. I love the meatball and chicken/brie sandwiches. The pate chinois that they have on I believe Thursdays is also good and super filling.   You can make your sandwich a combo and it comes with a drink or a beverage. I like that it's an option because I don't normally want a drink anyway. I had some really good (but also really decadent) banana chocolate bread pudding. The worst thing I've had from here was some sort of chocolate chip cookie/scone combo that was super dry and weird tasting.   It's a bit pricier than other places ( a sandwich combo is normally around $18 after tax) , but they do give you large portions and the food is really good. It's not a place we go to eat everyday, but I'm happy to eat here every now and then."}
{"text":"I want ALL THE SANDWICHES at this place. I've tried a bunch of them, and they're all so good I would go back and get the same thing the next day. The salad serving sizes looked a bit on the small side (for my liking) so I stick with the sandwiches.  It's also a deli, so you can pick up all kinds of pasta and pre-prepared (mostly Italian) goods.  This place is popular with the business crowd, so it can get a decent line going around lunch time - even then it's never taken me too long to get in and out. There's some seating, but not a lot (and it's mostly small tables). If the weather's good, I grab it and walk two blocks (towards the river) and eat it in the park."}
{"text":"I've only been there for lunch but you'll be getting a pretty good sandwich.   Ingredients are fresh, service is quick at the counter.  Prices are a little steep: sandwich with a tiny salad and a coke will run you about 20$ but hey, that's the old port for you.  I've probably been back already since writing this review, this place is a relatively safe bet in the area."}
{"text":"The best ever!!!  We're 3 friends visiting Montreal for few days we've tried some of most popular restaurants and highly recommended places Bello deli wasn't one of them!!!  We found it while we were walking around and we fall in love with it  We have tried the brownies it was so much good  The tea and the coffee are really really great ..  we decided to come here everyday as long as we staying here  Also the sandwiches are delicious and unique"}
{"text":"My favorite place for lunch near work! Everything there is awesome, from the large selection of sandwiches, the daily meals, the salads, the desserts. If you're in the area, do yourself a favour, and stop by. The staff is super friendly too :)"}
