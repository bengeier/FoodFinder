{"text":"Home cooked food....so good and portions are huge!  Chicken Paprikash every Monday...get there early they usually sell out.  Chicken Parmasan and Lasagna on Thursdays...oh my gosh it is awesome.  Portions are huge and the prices are so reasonable.  Go hungry and you will leave full.  Love this little diner :). Great food and service."}
