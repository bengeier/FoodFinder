{"text":"Drove into town that night from DC and didn't know the area well but googled/uber'd to nearest hookah bar to chill. Turned out to be a great night. The DJ had our heads bobbing all night, wings were on POINT, and the staff really took care of us. Next time I head to Toronto, I'll definitely be back. Thanks KY for the awesome night."}
{"text":"Excellent shisha place with good vibes & music. Best choices for shisha flavour in my opinion (we had their house mix). They also have the best fruit infused teas & a good array of food choices with very affordable prices in comparison to other shisha places. We ordered coffee, tea, strawberry milkshake (fresh),  wings & their house mix fries. Their house fries were a little too cheesy for me making them soggy, but overall everything else was great. Also very clean. Definitely worth a visit."}
{"text":"went to this place not sure what to expect, as soon as walked in was greeted by a guy i think he was one the owners. very nice welcome to me and 2 friends, explained they opened about 4 months ago, went through the menu in detail, even gave us excellent suggestions for tea choices. the recommendations/ friendly service made this visit here possibly one of the best spots ive been. definitely recommend! 5 star chill spot. good music also!"}
