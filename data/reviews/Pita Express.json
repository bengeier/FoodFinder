{"text":"Been going here for years now as one of my many lunch options. It's a nice 5-10 minute walk from my office so good excuse to get out and onto Stephen Ave.

First off, our office nicknamed this place 'Angryman Donair' since the owner (a super nice guy) used to always be mad at his staff and would look all pissy. Things have changed I'm sure, but the name still stuck.

Food wise, it's all good and the only complaint I would have it that when you eat it 2-3X a week, it gets a bit tedious. But the Falafels, Donairs, Salads, Vine Leaves, and even the ice cream are usually always very good. They always ask you what you want on it, and the veggies are always fresh. I like the half n' half myself with the beef and chicken. Very filling.

There's enough seating in the place even during the lunch rush, as most people grab something to go, and in the Summer it's nice to hangout on the patio and eat while people watching (even though those same people are probably watching you devour a giant messy, drippy donair which can *never* look classy)."}
{"text":"Oh thank you Pita Express for being open on New Year's Eve, and for feeding a few hungry children and their parents!

After attending the festivities in the Municipal Centre, we needed a little more than mini-donuts to sustain us.

We shared hummus, stuffed vine leaves, chicken shawarma, and a falafel pita. So delicious and great prices!

The little seating area upstairs is perfect and was nice for us to sit and have a chat while noshing on the lovely food.

Happy New Year to the fantastic family running this place as they obviously take pride in their food and their service!"}

The donair I had was loaded in toppings and the sweet sauce was the perfect blend of sweet and garlic.  I love supporting local especially when the owners are the front man and this place was delishious. I'll be back."}
