{"text":"We first learned of wings over from going to the one in state college and it was the most delicious wings we have ever had.  So we were so excited when we heard they were going to open one in Pittsburgh.  The service is always really nice and it's always really fast.  My husband and I like getting golden barbecue, it's so delicious and the boneless wings are the size of chicken tenders which makes it really nice for the price and we also recommend trying the hot garlic sauce for the garlic Parmesan wings and the barbecue and Wimpy flavored are really good as well. Really recommend this place to satisfy your wings craving!"}
{"text":"I ordered a large order of onion rings, which by the way were good, but the quantity was only enough to fill the regular size container and NOT the large container provided."}
{"text":"Absolutely awful.  The amount of salt used in their rubs and on the fries was incredible.  I wouldn't feed this food to an animal, let alone a paying customer."}
{"text":"Horrible service, took forever to get two small orders of wings, dirty inside.   Never again."}
{"text":"The customer service is incredibly bad.  We ordered delivery to a location that they commonly deliver.  The delivery didn't come for hour and half so I called and the manager blamed it on us said the phone was disconnected. The phone which I was calling him on.  He was like you still want the order or not?  In the rudest tone. Mo fo a hole ! ! !  I'm more than mad at the way he treated me.  No apologies for not trying, lying about the phone issue.    The wings are only ok.    Unfortunately no other wings delivery.   I still can't believe the phone person was such an a'hole."}
{"text":"mmmmmm best wings in Pittsburgh I can't stress this enough. and great service, as well! Aaron was so kind and helpful."}
{"text":"this is probably one of the worst wing places I ever went to!!!  the ketchup is watery and disgusting and the boneless wings were either overcooked or just that nasty to much breading I would never come here again and everyone that ask me about this place I tell them the same thing"}
{"text":"South Side was dying for a wing place for a while. But this place is meh. Wings are oversized (jumbo as they call it), which means you're just eating overfed factory farm chickens which is disgusting in its own right. Boneless \"wings\" are just tenders which doesn't make sense. And their orders are by the \"pound\" so unless you have a scale with you, you don't really know how much you pay for. Good variety and options but expensive for low quality. I give them credit for great service and timely delivery, but if you want wings, go to a nearby bar, it'll be cheaper and better."}
{"text":"ordered boneless buffalo wings and instead got dry chicken fingers and fries that look like they are from the giant eagle frozen section"}
{"text":"Simply fantastic!  Delicious wings, quick delivery, and reasonable prices.  They even deliver small orders.  Love it!"}
{"text":"I love the boneless wings and they have so many sauces to pick from! The teriyaki and west Texas mesquite are my favorites and the fries are a perfect amount of crispy! You can even order online to get a look through the crazy amount of sauces to pick from. My #1 place for football game wings!"}
{"text":"If you're on the South Side wings over Pittsburgh is an absolute go to wing spot. Based on where I live I think I've become a bit of an addict. It's my go to late night spot and occasionally, when I really feel like I've earned it, post workout meal.  My go to order order is the DC-3 honey barbecue. However, I had a couple my guys in from Detroit and over the course of weekend they at least have the menu and loved every option they tried.   So as far as the food, and that's important part, they give five stars from me. To counter staff is a whole other situation altogether. They are not bad, they just seem to cool to really engage you. Again it's far from a deal-breaker but it is one of those service points that I personally find a bit off-putting."}
{"text":"What I Ate Combo (Hangar 1)  What is it? A pound of boneless wings with fries and a drink  Price $16.57  Flavor I got Teriyaki and Golden Barbecue  Bonus I upgraded my fries to Ranch Waffle Fries   Verdict This was essentially a chicken tender/curly fry combo BUT, the greatest chicken tender/curly fry combo I think I've had my whole life up to this point.  The first thing that really struck me as awesome is how it wasn't greasy!  The fries and chicken was fried to perfection.  The chicken is perfectly white meat, how they should be.  Usually I'm grossed out by big portions but this didn't make me feel like that.  This was enough food for 2 people and worth the money.  I would defiantly come back here.  When it comes to chicken and fries this place should be in your bookmarks."}
{"text":"Hells yah!  First ever!  Hubs brought these home and we tore them up.  Tried the boneless buffalo red alert and the honey BBQ.  Pure excellence and not weak on the meat at all.  The red alert were stage 3 hot-ness.  They have 2 levels that come hotter.  Plenty spicy on the red alert and let me tell you I can handle the hot stuff.  Not sure on the set up or ambiance but if you are looking for the best boneless in town you just found it here.  Okay?!"}
{"text":"The best wings I've had. Their honey mustard are delicious. They offer chicken without the bone as well. I've never been disappointed by Wings Over Pittsburgh. The fries are awesome too."}
{"text":"Solid spot for late night wings after the bars in the South Side area. This spot was open till 3am and did not disappoint. Wings came out crisp and on point. Seasoned waffle fries, done son. Get it."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place for boneless wings and waffle fries in Pittsburgh. I always get a combination of barbecue and honey mustard wings. I'm never disappointed. It's good late night food, especially after several beers."}
{"text":"Stopped by here for a post work-out feast. The place was well-lit and clean. Even though it was nearly 9pm on a Sunday, there was still a good amount of people eating there. It was a self-serve place, but the cashier was nice enough to bring our food right to our table. The wait wasn't that long.   For ~$19, you get 25 wings in 5 flavors of your choice. We tried: cajun teriyaki, hot garlic, afterburner (super spicy buffalo), citrus chipotle and mustang ranch. They were sooooooo good with the right amount of sauce and crispiness. The sauce was just right...enough to cover the whole wing, not all soggy and dripping. Out of the 5 flavors I tried, my favorite was CAJUN TERIYAKI, and my least favorite was mustang ranch. Overall, it was a wonderful experience and I definitely recommend this place if you are a wings lover, because it will definitely \"wings\" you over!"}
{"text":"We ordered delivery tonight instead of eating at the restaurant. My boyfriend lived on Wings Over in college, so he was like a kid in and candy shop when we ordered. We ordered boneless hot garlic wings with fries and traditional wings that were red alert.   My boyfriend ate it so fast that he couldn't move after. He always enjoys wings especially from here. I enjoyed my food as well. The wings were very yummy and the sauce descriptions really helped me decide the right one. The fries were crispy still when we got them.  The only issue we ran into was we ordered extra sauce that was honey bbq but we just got extra hot sauce. Not a big deal at except we paid for it.   We will definitely order again but actually eat them there ! If you like wings, I would absolutely suggest ordering from here."}
{"text":"This place sort of reminds me of Buffalo Wild Wings as far as taste, which isn't a bad thing. I thought the price was reasonable for as much food as you get. I got 3 different sauces because I couldn't choose - buffalo, citrus chipotle, and Jamaican jerk. They were all tasty but the citrus chipotle was my favorite. The wings are really big, too, so you're definitely fulfilled. I also ordered a Caesar salad as the side. Nice portion but not enough dressing at all. I do wish they would give you ranch or blue cheese and that you didn't have to pay for the celery. However, I ordered from Postmates, so that could've been the reason why. I'll order from here again, I love wings and these are definitely satisfying."}
{"text":"I've only eaten here once to try it out. I just aborted my second, and last ever order, and that's why I'm writing this review.  Yelp's \"full menu\" says that 15 bone-in wings are $13.99. Not cheap, but a fair value. When actually ordering, however, the price was marked as $15.99. After delivery fee, taxes, and tip? $23... for 15 chicken wings... with no sides... or extra sauce... or drink.  Wings Over (fill in the blank), you have a wing place with a broad selection of sauces, and there aren't a lot of options for decent wings in your delivery range. But let's be honest, the wings are JUST decent. They aren't special, gourmet, organic, free range, jumbo, stuffed, grandma's secret recipe, etc.; they're just normal, mass-produced, aerial themed chicken wings. I went to your website, and you don't even advertise any specials. Even B-dubs has specials (and beer).  $23 for 15 \"one-step-above-fast-food\" wings? Nah, I'd rather buy buffalo wings from a pizza place out of principle."}
{"text":"I have a huge obsession for anything to do with buffalo chicken - so naturally I had to try buffalo chicken from here! It is a very small place that you can eat in or take to go. I ordered a half pound of boneless wings in the Jet Fuel buffalo sauce. I asked what the \"normal\" spice level buffalo sauce was and they told me Red Alert was so I went with the next higher - I LOVE spicy! I like to think I have a high tolerance for spice, but this put it to the test, not in a bad way though. The Jet Fuel had a very unique spicy flavor which I liked, and they had some SERIOUS kick. The chicken pieces were really big and I liked the breading/crispness of them.  I think if/when I do go back I will try the more mild sauces as the Jew Fuel was almost too much for me, still super yummy though! This place is good for some quick wings and they have a nice variety for you to try!"}
{"text":"Its a good spot to go to if you dont want what you actual ordered. I ordered a Cesar salad with chicken. I actually got a regular chicken salad. When I asked where the Cesar dressing was they said they didn't have anymore. Thats something they should have mentioned before I ordered the salad. Oh and no cheese. My Husband order waffle fries they gave him regular shoestring fries."}
{"text":"Their wings are good as well as their fries, but only if you get the Cajun seasoning on them. The customer service though is severely LACKING! they don't deliver to where I live but whatever the biggest problem I have is that if you're picking up you can't pay over the phone by card. Which you think they would allow to ensure they got payment in case you decide not to pick up the food. I tried to order on the website so I could pay by card but of course their website doesn't work. The only way you can pay by card via phone is if you're doing delivery. Not sure what's up with Pittsburgh being behind with the times."}
{"text":"They service so many different tastes of wings. I have tried three sources. It's delicious and smells so good."}
{"text":"The food here isn't bad, but it's not great either. We came here multiple times to use a groupon (it was one of those where you spend X amount of money and receive 3 groupons), and we probably won't return again. The staff are nice, but they also seem to goof around a lot. It's also a pretty dirty location. The floors were disgusting every time we came. I would not think to eat inside here. They don't make their own ranch and their packaged ranch is not very good. Every time we came, we ordered their wraps- which honestly are a good deal, considering how much food they put inside. However, nothing sticks out as being super good. It's just ok."}
{"text":"I tried this place the other night and was not disappointed. I ordered online which was simple ordered for delivery which was very fast, I ordered and within 20mins they were already there. GOOD FOOD great service. this will be my new wing place since me and my dad order wings at least once a week !"}
{"text":"Okay place. Reminded me of a pizza delivery spot that really doesn't encourage done in, Just delivery. No fountain drinks. A bunch of young people working there goofing off. Fries were cold. Was not impressed with the wings at all very bland both dry rub and saucy wings"}
{"text":"The good thing about writing a review is that it may take a few days before you complete it.  Wings Over Pittsburgh has totally benefited from this.  If I would have wrote a review after my first experience with this establishment it would be less stars and bitter words.  I completely love the wrap they have available here.  It is a meal unto itself.  Nothing really special about it, plain flour tortilla, lettuce, tomato and pieces of boneless wings with your choice of sauce or dry rub.  I have tried several different sauces and one dry rub.  For the wrap it is best to choose a sauce, if you get a dry rub, you will need something to dip it in, or hope that the juices from the tomatoes and lettuce will make it tasty.  You can add crinkle cut fries for $1 or seasoned waffle fries for $1.50.  As I said before, the wrap itself is more than enough for a meal.  When I get the fries with it I always feel like I'm stupid for doing so.  I can never finish both and I hate to waste it.  My friends always order the ribs from here and are never disappointed.  If I was a rib man I would be too.  They look mighty good.    (minus two stars for my first encounter with you, but plus one star because you totally redeemed yourself and credited me on my next order)"}
{"text":"This is my go-to place for late night food. The sauces are great, and the waffle fries are awesome. The boneless wings are a little chewy, but still not bad. I'm currently waiting for delivery from another restaurant for over an hour and wishing that I would have ordered Wings Over, because I would have eaten by now. Thanks for being consistent Wings Over Pittsburgh. Never stop delivering until 3am."}
{"text":"Quicker than quoted delivery - that's a huge plus in my book. Plus they brought it directly to my hotel room which is always nice. The wings were pretty standard though and not that special so if you're looking for something more then I would look elsewhere. Otherwise I think that their customer service and speed was excellent and they had no problems with my order."}
{"text":"Good place to grab a bite after work since they're open late. Wings are cooked the same every time. They have plenty of sauce choices. Ribs are ok, but nothing to write home about. They deliver, but I usually swing by and grab take out."}
{"text":"My go-to late night wing spot! I'm a college student so I often get midnight cravings. Their delivery service is really good and they usually come really fast - quicker than the estimated time shown online. The combo meals include drinks and fries which is pretty clutch also! Would recommend!"}
{"text":"The service was amazing. The food not so much. The wings were way over cooked and chewy not crunchy. The wraps were made by a 5th grader and the fries are from grade school lunch. Overall this place is not recommend by me. If you're looking for wings there are a ton of better places than this place. By the service was nice!"}
{"text":"These wings are kinda dry and the flavor does not go through the whole wing...they are good in a pinch when it's late and you are hungry.  But I've had better wings from the frozen food section"}
{"text":"We order wings over about once a week and it hits the spot every time. The sauces are amazing and the fries are good too! We get the hangar 2- boneless and about 12 wings with fries and 2 cans of coke. We usually have a wing or 2 leftover (just as good the second day!). They have a quick delivery, ~ 20 minutes. They are open till 4am on weekends too!   The boneless wings are more like small chicken tenders- we prefer the sauces on them. If we get a dry rub we usually get it on the regular wings. The waffle fries are good, but can sometimes be too crispy/hard. The crinkle fries are always on point."}
{"text":"Very good food, limited menu but my chicken and fries were delicious and the delivery was super fast! A little expensive but for good taste and fast service I was ok with it!  I got honey BBQ and the mild/BBQ mix was good as well! Garlic park dusting in the fries as well!"}
{"text":"I've had dinner here a few times including delivery, and the hype really died down.  There are so many 5 star reviews that yelpers may start thinking it's flawless, when really it's just a fresh wing with awesome sauce (lol, awesome sauce). I really enjoy the Golden BBQ & order that each time. We've also had the Citrus Chipotle, Jamaican Jerk & Sweet Chili. All had their own unique flavors.  The boneless wings still are delish & large (chicken tender size). The delivery is fast and efficient.  Service is deff hit or miss. I've had really great service somethings, but not-so-good counter service a number of times (i eat here reallllly often, so not sure of the ratio lol)   My waffle fries that I upgraded to were completely well done. Not a taste of potato.. more like potato chips. I love waffle fries too :/  So again, great wings & and great mix of sauces, but don't let all of these fabb reviews fool you."}
{"text":"We ordered delivery at work. The chicken wasn't cooked to our liking. Five of us ordered and three voted never to get delivery from there again. The fries were soggy too. Maybe it's better to just go to restaurant instead of delivery."}
{"text":"The beat tasting wings I have ever had. Place was very clean, cashier was kind and polite, and the wings tasted like nothing is ever had. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"Sorry folks. Wings Over sold out. Not only is there's a $2.99 fee for ordering on GrubHub (exceptionally high) but now they have a $25 minimum order on weekends. I recommend R&B's Pizza for you wings instead, they are cheaper and the wings are excellent. Just as fat and juicy as Wings Over, but at lower price. Very disappointing to see a price gouge like this from one of my old favourite restaurants. $4 worth of wings for $27? No thanks."}
{"text":"I order from Wings almost once every week. Their normal wings are really good. I recommend getting the Louisiana sweet heat if you like spicy, the Cajun bar b q, and honey mustard. I don't recommend their boneless wings personally, because they're kind of soggy. I LOVE their fried chicken sandwiches, I always get it with Louisiana sweet heat. It always fills me up and the crinkle cut fries are really delicious as well. Only downside about the sandwiches is that if you leave it out for too long it will taste bad cold and it will be soggy. The fries are like that too :("}
{"text":"I love the Wings Over chain. As a PSU alum, I frequently order from Wings Over in State College and would still order from there when visiting as a treat. Opening a location again in Pittsburgh made my day. They offer in bone and boneless wings, fries and ribs. All are amazing. I usually get the Hanger 1, which is a pound of boneless wings with 2 flavors, fries and a drink. They have a large selection of flavors, both sauces and dry rubs. Even though they don't deliver to my apartment, I'm willing to drive over and pick it up. It can also be a little expensive, but the wings are worth it."}
{"text":"The staff is great, food is always perfect, my orders have never been wrong. WOP is a great place to eat!"}
{"text":"I have been ordering from wingsover for the past month and they are awesome! EVery order that I placed was at my door within the hour and the food is delicious and priced accordingly. The wraps have delicious crispy chicken and the wings meat is very tender and well cooked. We get wings from here rather than Pizza Milanos because of the better variety of sauces and great food."}
{"text":"Mixed bag, but would do again.  Pros:  Super fast delivery!  Wings were perfectly cooked as were the waffle fries.  Food arrived hot and on time (they're like, just a mile from my house).  Literally everything was delicious. Excellent pepper wings.  Just the right heat!  The waffle fries were awesome.  Good blue cheese and ketchup.  Cons:  I'm unsure why I pick a dressing (blue cheese, ranch, etc) if there are no celery sticks.  It's not like anyone dips their wings into this.  Dressing is entirely for dipping veggies in and the very expensive wings did not come with this.  Garlic/parm wings tasted of wing, neither garlic nor parm, so not an iota of flavour at all other than chicken--not even salt or pepper.  Sad.  The waffle fries were in no way the flavour I asked for (garlic parm)--they were bright red and I think the were Siracha or something?  I can't fault this too much, as they were still really good.  I had a coupon that was never applied. :(  Really con:  I suspect their delivery driver rail-roaded me into an extra tip, as I'd done it online already and he specifically made a point of saying \"what about the tip?\" I'm a big believer in tipping and always do.  It's not on to have your driver ask about such a thing *at all*!!!!!!! Super bad form.  He also made me come to the street in pajamas and barefoot, when it's literally his job to come to the door and I specified \"knock loud\" so we were sure we'd hear him.  We even have a bell.  He didn't leave the street. So, I think he scammed me into basically tipping him the equivalent of 40%.  And he also *sped* down our very cramped street while texting on his way out!  WTH?  Overall, really lovely food, poor attention to detail, and you should coach your drivers to never ask about such things.  It's gauche."}
{"text":"Hello all, how can a place say they sell \"wings\" when it's really wing \"dings\"? It ticks me off when a place doesn't know the difference between the two. If a wing ding is what your selling then say so A Real wing has 3 sections. If you pittsburghers want a Real wing then go to Monkee Bar, Valley Hotel, Twin Oaks, Bistro Bar just to name a few. Don't go to Wings over Pittsburgh for wings....cause they only offer dings....NOT wings. Bad advertising for them. BAIT AND SWITCH."}
{"text":"We saw this place in Carson Street one day so we came back to try it. My son and I both ordered Hangar 1 combos. They come with 10 boneless tenders, fries and a can of soda. Everything was made fresh to order. We both ordered dry rubs. I ordered Garlic Parm and my son ordered the Mustang Ranch. The chicken was hot and crispy but the rubs were VERY salty. I first thought the price was a bit high until I saw how much food we got. We both had enough left over to take home lunch for the next day. I wouldn't rush back but would come back to try bone in wings with sauce."}
{"text":"Delicious and affordable.  Ordered delivery around 9pm. The driver was so nice. Would like to recommend Citrus Chipotle boneless wings, so crispy and delicious. The only booboo imo might be that the bone-in wings were a little bit pink. Will surely try more flavors the next time!"}
{"text":"Ordered some delivery during the Pens game this week - wings seemed fitting. These were just as good as I remember them years ago in State College. Plenty of flavors, decent prices, and the freedom to customize everything just how you want it. We ordered boneless wings and waffle fries and were extremely happy with both. Delivery arrived 15 before schedule time too, which is always a plus. We will definitely be ordering from here again soon."}
{"text":"New to Pittsburgh and was craving wings one night after a long day. Tried to place an order online, but learned that they did not deliver to my place, even though I only live 2-3 miles and 15 minutes away. But this did not deter me! I decided to call the restaurant instead and place a pick up order. I ordered the \"puddle jumper\" or 10 bone in wings, half golden bbq and half 7 pepper. I also ordered a small waffle fry and a can of cherry coke. So after a very long day spent in my car, I got back in and drove through downtown Pittsburgh on a saturday night. Once I get to their location on East Carson St I found out that there is no parking to be had. This is definitely no fault of Wings Over since it is all street parking, and E Carson is a fairly busy spot for late night activities. After circling the block a few times, I parked and went in to pickup. I didn't take the time to throughly look and was handed a black bag with a few containers. After being enticed by the smell for 15 minutes, I finally got a look inside. Two boxes, no coke.  Looked at the receipt to make sure. Yep, I was charged for a coke I didn't get. Annoying, but thought the food could make up for it. Waffle fries are a fav for me, by the way. Opened up the fries. No waffle. No straight cut. Crinkle cut. You know, the ones they serve in school cafeterias. Half crispy and half soggy. Again, I consulted my receipt. Yep Sm Waf fries was written clearly. Optimistic (and still hungry), I looked at my wings box. Ding Ding! Correct order. Now, on to the food review. 7 pepper was not a sauce but a dry rub. Pretty good. Nice pepper flavor; would have liked more kick though. And the wing was well fried. The golden bbq. Just. No.  These wings were oversauced, and as a result, soggy and not crisp. The sauce was just okay. NO hint of bbq at all. It is a mustard based sauce I think. Lots of tang and oddly sweet. It was like a slightly more savory version of honey mustard sauce. Not that good. Oddly enough, in Morgantown, WV (my hometown), they have the gold sauce wings at Kegler's (a local sports bar), which is what these could have been. Mustard based sauce, with kick, AND other spices.  There are positives though. The wings are meaty and you get good bang for your buck. The dry rub was done very well. Also they make their own ketchup for the fries. It is different from reg old Heintz, which is a go to in Pittsburgh. Nice spice kick and less sweet.       Overall: Good for a pinch; great drunk food; I would dine in next time though."}
{"text":"Came here for a late night snack. LOVED that it was open til 1am on a SUNDAY!!   Ordered 25 wings in 5 flavors.  We recommend the dry rubbed garlic parmesan and spicy garlic. Also tried the dry rubbed mesquite BBQ, jet fuel and citrus Chipotle.   The wings were cooked perfectly; juicy and sauced nicely. The staff was also friendly and helpful in deciding the awesome flavors.  The jet fuel was hot and there was flavor, not just heat. The citrus Chipotle was sweet and reminded me of KFC's honey BBQ wings. The mesquite BBQ was just like lays BBQ potato chips.   Are these the best wings I've ever had?  No, but they were extremely satisfying late at night (AND sober lol)."}
{"text":"Wings over used to be my go to spot before their changes in how they structure their delivery. Grubhub takes far too long for the wings to be fresh and the fees in addition to the high wing price point is unreasonable. It's like wings over is as dead as wingstop is. If they went back to normal it would be nice."}
{"text":"I'll start off this review by stating that I only ever come to Wings Over late at night. They get my business simply because they are open until 3 am. I wouldn't really think of going to Wings Over during the day. With that being said....  Everything is just, OK.   I usually end up ordering a combo of boneless chicken wings. That comes with fries, and a drink. I always opt for the waffle fries and I add a cheese cup as well. I pass on the seasonings because in my opinion they tasted like crap and ruined the fries for me.   What I do like is the fact that you can split every 5 wings to be different flavors. So with an order of 20 wings, 4 flavors? I'd like to see that at more wing places. Their numerous styles of BBQ are great. Note, the buffalo sauces are pretty spicy in my opinion.   As for the service, the girls working behind the counter are pretty nice but overall horribly unprofessional. BUT, I mean I don't expect too much more than people goofing off at 2:30 in the morning. I feel like I would be doing the same. If you go in late like I do, please be advised there will be South Sides post bar drunks coming in.   3 stars."}
{"text":"To be fair I've only ever gotten delivery, but why would I leave my house if they deliver fast! My go to flavors are definitely honey BBQ and the Jamaican jerk, but some of the flavors are a complete miss, especially the dry rubs don't even bother. I always go boneless as well and they are so juicy, I'm craving them as I write. The waffle fries are good but not great and I like the garlic Parmesan and Cajun the best but it's never equally seasoned on the fries is the biggest downside. Overall i would say the best wings in Pittsburgh!"}
{"text":"Pretty decent wing spot. I think the overall rating is so high b/c there aren't a lot of \"good\" wing places in Pittsburgh. The only thing that would drag this place down is the store hours are inconsistent. I think when they first opened it opened after 4pm, then they changed it to 11am M-F temporarily. When you call the phone just rings and rings, there isn't a voicemail to tell you their hours or if they're closed. Consistently would be nice."}
{"text":"I love that everyone who is writing reviews for this place remember fondly former times at other Wings Over locations.   I tried it for the same reason.  It was as good as I remember.  My husband and I looked at each other after the first bite and each said \"This tastes right!\"  No matter how many wings I have eaten since my university days, there is just something about the boneless wings at the Wings Over locations.    Don't go here expecting the best food in the world, but after a night of drinking, or if you are looking for nostalgic flavors this is the right place to go!"}
{"text":"This place is always so good! Huge portions with a lot of really good sauces and dry rubs. I've been here many times before but this time around I got the garlic Parmesan dry rub and wimpy buffalo sauce and my friend got the ranch dry rub and the Cajun blackened dry rub. We both got the Hangar 1 combo which comes with boneless wings, soda, and fries. They give you a lot of food, though they are pretty expensive in my opinion. It's probably the only reason why I don't order from them more frequently. Really good food though."}
{"text":"I'm not impressed. I'm a pretty big wing connoisseur and these wings are average. I've never been to any other Wings Over...locations, so I went into this pretty open.  Their online ordering is easy-peasy. I ordered a hefty selection to make sure I had a nice overview on what Wings Over can offer.  The \"boneless wings\" to start with Wimpy Buffalo sauce. These aren't boneless wings; they are chicken tenders. The sauce was good, but the meat was dry, requiring lots of bleu cheese to compensate (I do love me some bleu cheese, though)!  I also sampled the Honey BBQ, 7 Pepper, and Oriental Sesame. It's true; these wings are def meatier than other places. @Curtis G. enjoyed the Honey BBQ best while I preferred the 7 Pepper dry rub. Again, these wings were OK.  I'm open to try new wing places, and I can give props to Wings Over for meaty wings and a varied selection of sauces.  However, I don't care how much meat you give me (ha ha) if it is dry and the nice sauce flavor is lost in a river of bleu cheese."}
{"text":"Why mix the sauces?  I like this place and I will be back. They are right on Carson and open late. The employees were nice and helpful and the place is bright and clean with lots of TVs. The menu also has BBQ but I was here for wings.  The prices are decent 15 wings (sections not whole) for 13$. The wings are well cooked and slightly crunchy even after sauce. A nice variety of sauces and they will let you taste them all.   That brings me to the problem, the 15 piece comes with 3 sauces. We got chilli, jerk, and barbecue sauces. I wish I could describe them to you but I can't because instead of 3 different flavors they mixed the wings in the box with no division. By the time I got home there was really no way to know which was which. The resulting mixture was pretty tasty but I will make sure they don't mix them next time."}
