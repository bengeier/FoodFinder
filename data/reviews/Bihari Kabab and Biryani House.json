{"text":"I have been to this place three times so far in a year and have found the quality and taste quite consistent. Food is really good - it does not seems like those type of pre cooked recipes  where frozen cooked items are mixed to prepare just in time food. Prices are very reasonable. It has small sitting area though and no fancy but clean place. Food portion size is just about right. Fresh baked Naan is very yummy.  You place the order at the counter and there are no waiters to serve. The place is not that much visible in the market and the market entrance is is bit tricky on East side of  Morningside just around 30 meters south of Sheppard Ave traffic light."}
{"text":"Make sure you have your food the same day you order it. Take out only. Ordered couple of times - biriyani & butter chicken-good, cheap, take out style food."}
{"text":"Great local joint for Tandoor fare. They have a legit Charcoal Tandoor, which means big FLAVOUR! (Note: Always check with restaurants to see if they use Charcoal or Electric. Electric= no flavour)  Stand out dishes are the Lamb Karahi, and Chicken Tikka. This is more of a takeout place, though there are a few tables to dine in.  Call at least 30 minutes in advance of your pick-up time. Everything is made fresh to order.   One of the best places for Indian food in Scarborough."}
{"text":"Trust me I'm Indian! These guys don't know what biryani is..horrible taste! I wonder if even the people who work there eat this food! Just drive to silver spoon at Mccowan and Sheppard and you get the same priced BIryani with much better flavor and authenticity! I will never visit this place again unless I am starving"}
{"text":"Ordered a family combo tonight. Came with 4 hot and fresh naan, chikken tikka, chicken kebabs, beef curry and biryani! All for $25.  In an area surrounded by south Indian and sri Lankan food this place is much needed.  We were very happy with the food quality and price. Lots of leftovers for lunch tomorrow for the 2 of us.  We will be back.  The restaurant is a bit  hidden they have a very small store front located between the Caribbean and Sri Lankan spots. Got to love Scarborough."}
