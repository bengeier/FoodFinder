{"text":"We used to like to dine here when it was the Hot Rod Grille, but those days appear to be over.  When we walked in tonight, a waitress called out from the bar and said she had a large party upstairs and one in meeting room downstairs, so she didn't have time to wait on us!????  If they knew they had two groups coming in, shouldn't they have had more help on hand?  We left feeling like they could care less if they had any business at all.  I would rate them less than one star if I could!"}
{"text":"Their burger with nitro sauce is awesome. Always had good service at the bar with a few different bar tenders."}
{"text":"This place just opened and used to be Hot Rod Grill. I decided to try it since it is accross the street from our house. My friend and I went on a Wednesday night around 9:30pm. 

When we walked in we saw a sign that said \"Please wait for hostess to seat you\" so we waited for 10 minutes with no acknowledgement and decided at that point to go sit at the bar. The lady bartender looked at us and continued to text on her phone for the next 5 minutes. When she finally gave us menus.. it took another 10 minutes for her to take a drink order (there was only 8 or so other customers in the place). I ordered a margarita and my friend a beer... as she was shaking my margarita, the glass broke into the ice bin and then it was another couple minutes before we got our drinks. She then walked away and began to eat her meal... in front of us!!!! What?????

Being a restaurant manager, you never eat in front of the guest's... 1. Sanitation and 2. Just rude an unprofessional. I don't care if it's an Arby's they don't eat at the cash register! So after she was satisfied with her food, she took our order. The burgers were straight out of a package and less than tasty. The cook brought them out by the way, the bartender was busy on her phone! We left and I vowed not to return.....

However, we had a little to much to drink at my house, got hungry and wandered back over two days later at 1am... same bartender.... this time we sat at a table. The bartender didn't even come over to the table, but shouted from the bar asking what we wanted. We ordered breakfast this time, Biscuits and Gravy and Chicken Fried Steak.... she took are order, didn't write it down and then from the computer system shouted accross the bar at us to say our order again. The Chicken Fried Steak was good and the Biscuits and Gravy lacked sausage and it was made with a lot of flour. Thankfully the bartender switched shifts with a guy and he was much better! 

When the check finally came they over charged us by $7 because the first bartender had no clue what she was doing... maybe she was drinking or at least I hope that would be the valid excuse.

Close or not I will NEVER be back...... okay food and HORRIBLE Service!"}
