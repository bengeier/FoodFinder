{"text":"Small little storefront, a little shabby. Pizza was tasty tho. We got cheese because it was late and veggie takes longer; they were closing at 2 for shabbos.

The flapper on the toilet was broken so I had to pull it up to fill the tank so I could flush.
Good for a quick slice or carry-out on shabbos."}

{"text":"After a Passover grocery trip (down the street at Unger's), my wife and I stopped in for a whole pie and a few other side dishes.  Looked so good we decided to stay in and eat instead of schlepping it home.

We ordered a whole mushroom pizza, potato knishes and fried cauliflower.  To start, the fried cauliflower was amazingly good!  Crisp with great flavor.  We then ended up sharing a potato knish and bringing the other one home...they were huge!  Knishes were in a round shape stuffed with a really great potato and onion mixture that reminded me of Bubbe cooking in the kitchen.  Finally, we got our pie!  The mushrooms were fresh (not canned!) and the crust was slightly chewy with great flavor although the sauce was on the mild side for a red sauce.

Overall we loved the meal and will most definitely be back."}
