{"text":"Fast service, pleasant waitress, kinda cheap. Not a bad place for my first time in Toronto China town. Highly recommended"}
{"text":"I was here for take out. The server was very polite and even gave us water while we picked out our selections from the menu. We got chives pockets, pan-fried shrimp dumplings, noodles in soybean paste, & the special fried rice.  The dumplings were the best dumplings I have ever had!  The sauce that goes with it was great too. The noodles in soybean paste was pretty good too.  If you mix it well, it won't be as salty.  The special fried rice was good too.  The flavor isn't overwhelming like regular Americanized or Canadianized fried rice.  Chives pockets have always been one of my favorites.  And their pockets are flavorful and big!  You could ask for some dumpling sauce and use it on the chives pockets.  It's delicious!  And yes, I waited for my food for a little while... Which the server apologized for. It was fine with me since I was chatting away with my friend anyway.  I totally recommend it."}
{"text":"Delicious food. Was pretty packed so food came a bit slow, but they always made sure we had something to eat while we waited. Will return, frequently"}
{"text":"The dumplings are decent but the service is incredibly slow. So slow that I will not be returning. I waited 35 minutes for my one order of dumplings. That's completely unacceptable. Mother's Dumplings or Dumpling House over this place any day. Definitely not worth the completely crazy long wait."}
{"text":"Malatang (numbing spicy noodle soup with self-served ingredients that you pick from a freezer and wait for them to cook) is a budget pick in here. But make sure you have a whole hour to eat as tons of people come in for it and then it gets slow. They have it in mild to extra spicy levels and being a super big szechuan spice fan, I'm super happy that the extra spicy was a fine level of heat. The other entrees that claim to be spicy however, are weak and pretty much mild. The sliced beef and five spice tofu appetizers are decent and salty.   The dumplings are a-ok, but I just have high standards because I know how to make my own. We ordered the beef pancake but they gave us these panfried pork buns instead. They tasted weird. The server was very timid and looked tired. The owner was nice and glad to hear I wanted extra spicy. Like any northern Chinese place there's skewers on the menu but I haven't tried them yet. I'd go back for that and the malatang. it's a 3.5 but I'm giving them the benefit of the doubt."}
{"text":"We got takeout dumplings, ma po tofu, noodles, and scallion pancakes from here for a birthday dinner. Everything was delicious, better than anything we can order in around here (North Toronto). I don't know what the in-restaurant experience is like, but I would definitely get takeout from here again."}
{"text":"An unassuming place, we have been here at least three times. The first time we were lured in by the sandwich board on the street and the promise of chive and egg pockets, which we had previously in Flushing NYC and wanted more of. Clearly this first visit worked out because we came back. Second time we dropped in for a quick bite and thought it was good. But this 3rd visit we came with a family crew of 4 adults and two kids. And it was lunch and we hadn't had breakfast and so we were ready. When we walked in at just before noon on a Saturday we were the first ones there and the staff were still mopping the floor. We wondered for a moment if we had made a mistake, but by the time we had finished ordering - they give you a paper and you write down your choices - the place had completely filled up. We had a selection of steamed and fried dumplings, poached spicy fish, egg and chives pies, beef pies, shredded potatoes, and noodles. And was all amazing. Sometimes you need the right mood, the right order, and the right moment -- this was it. Food was just spot on."}
{"text":"Seriously this is he worst beef noodle I had in Toronto. Soup is far from tasty- too much sesame oil in it. Beef tastes like it was cooked several days ago. Vegetable looks stale and is bitter! Malatang might be good, but I have lost interest to try. Not sure how long this business gonna last, but I would never visit again."}
{"text":"Their malatang is seriously amazing. I also tried a few side dishes and soups on different occasions, but those are just mediocre."}
{"text":"Malatang means \"numbing spicy hot\". It's a spicy broth bowl, where you choose your own ingredients. The price is by weight. $9.05 per 500g  At the back, there is a refrigerated table of various ingredients. You choose your toppings and you put them into a plastic bowl. Bring it up near the cash register so that they can weigh it. They ask you if you would like to add lamb (say yes), and how spicy you want it (I recommend medium unless you have terrific spice tolerance).  The broth is very good to excellent.  My favourite ingredients are: Fish balls, spongy tofu, pigs blood, clear noodles. Add lamb.  Depending on what you like, the price can escalate quickly.  Dumplings are good and reasonably priced. Pork / Chive was solid.  It's a super casual vibe.  Make sure to catch a glimpse of the hologram of Chairman Mao behind the cash register.  BONUS: perfect for a freezing cold winter day."}
{"text":"We were walking in search of a place that would be different than the rest. So we stopped at this place. Let me just start off with the waiter that waited on us. He could not speak English, so it was very hard to communicate with him. It took about 30 minutes for our food to come out and the place was completely empty. But, when the food eventually came out, it was delicious! The dumplings are excellent!"}
{"text":"Went here on a Monday night with a party of three. Lots of students come here as their prices are really good for the quality of food. We each got the Malatang ($9.55/500g) and shared an order of their steamed pork and cabbage dumplings- all of which were pretty good. Note: if you are not used to spice, I'd suggest getting the \"not spicy at all\" option.   I am usually pretty good with spice but this was something else. I ordered \"very little spice\" and  it came with a good dallop of spicy sauce. So I mixed it into the soup like anyone else would, thinking that I would be able to handle the spice. As I mixed it I could already tell  that this would be really spicy as a reddish orange colour proceeded to spread throughout my soup. I took one bite and my tongue was on fire. After the second bite I had to ask the waitress for another bowl of clean soup so I could dip my noodles in it before eating the next bite. After just the first dip of my noodles in the clean soup, the clean soup then turned fire red as well. By this point, the soup wasn't the only thing that was red- my lips and face were completely red as well! The waitress seeing my struggle then helped me completely switch my original bowl of spicy soup into a clean soup base.   Besides being really embarrassed at the end, the food itself was very light and tasted fantastic. Our food came very quickly and the service was very accommodating. I would definitely recommend coming here and trying out their malatang. I think when I left they had a good laugh haha."}
{"text":"Cash and debit only. Nice restaurant with good service. Came for lunch on a Friday and it was moderately busy. Food came out quite fast.  Pork, chive and shrimp pan fried dumplings: Came piping hot with a nice brown crust. Juicy inside and honestly just a tasty dumpling. Enjoyed it.  Mixed signature pan fried dumplings: so so hot and again nice brown crust. I don't even know what are in these too busy inhaling them.  Boiled pork and celery dumplings: juicy and good, tasted really fresh. Enjoyed it.  Beef noodle soup: a good broth, not too salty, and a strong sesame taste. Noodles were good and the beef was tasty."}
{"text":"So  1.waited a long time 2.got my food wrong 3.no apologizes 4.just because i said i didn't touch \"my\" food, they went and served that food to others after i brought it back to the kitchen  Both the owner and the server suck! If you don't know how to run a business, don't do it! Other people would think Chinese are stupid and unprofessional!! ??????????????????????????"}
