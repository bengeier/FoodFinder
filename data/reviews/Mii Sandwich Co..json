{"text":"The sandwiches cost 1.5 to 2x times as much compared to the other places but I guess they've to make up for the rent."}
{"text":"Food was great but the service is incredibly slow for the amount of people working there. I've now been there four times as I work in the mall and every single time that I've been there they have messed up my order (three times when I ask for spicy they give me mild, fourth time they forgot about my sandwich entirely) and have always forgotten my order.   I do love the food though as it is delicious, but the missteps in communicating with their team makes the wait truly long (ordered at 5:20, received sandwich at 5:42)"}
{"text":"Very shocked to see a banh mi centred menu in a mall food court. They even had pho and rice platters. Even more surprising, the food was good! Bun was perfect and the sweet potato fries came with some sort of Korean mayo that was so good.highly recommended. I'll be back for sure"}
{"text":"I am truly a fan of this place. I always order the same thing: coconut chicken sandwich with the sweet potato fries (they've changed these fries over time - they were much much better before but I still like them). They have varying levels of spice.  I have chosen the hot sauce most times but dared to try the thai cilli a couple of times and it is just SPICY! so heads up.   I tried the same place at the scarborough town center location and let me tell you, it wasn't the same.  Totally recommend the yorkdale location though."}
{"text":"Amazing Asian Caesar salad. I get it every time. Crisp, fresh, flavorful- especially with the crispy tofu on top."}
{"text":"1) Lots of staff = Quick Service  2) MANY different fresh vegetable options for the sandwiches/salads  3) I got the classic Lemongrass Chicken sandwich and it was DELICIOUS. You can choose how spicy you want it like Chipotle.   Really impressed."}
{"text":"I have never had such bad experience at a food court.  Normally I do not expect good service in this setting, however, I felt very disrespected by the cashier (the chubby one).  There was a miscommunication when I placed the order but there were no apology given.  When her manager (I am assuming) asked her what happened, she blamed it on me while I was standing in front of her, in English too!!  Her face and expressions are still haunting me and I will never recommend anyone to go there.  Such a shame, the food was actually very delicious."}
{"text":"Great addition to Yorkdale Mall's food court!  Mii Sandwich Co. is another Asian-fusion restaurant that has recently popped up in Toronto.   Mii Sandwich Co. offers customers traditional Vietnamese food such as pho noodle soup and lemongrass marinated bbq.  In addition to traditional Vietnamese dishes, the restaurant also offers a menu of revamped lunch items which in my opinion really sets the restaurant apart from the other food stands at the food court.  Asian-fusion revamped lunch items includes bao sandwiches (imagine Viet-inspired burgers), Viet-inspired tacos, and Viet-inspired submarine sandwiches. I find all the Asian-fusion items to be a DELICIOUS ALTERNATIVE to the usual burger and fries lunch fare.  The food is reasonably priced with customers being able to purchase a filling meal or combo for around $10 or so.  It's also worth noting that all food items are prepared in an open display so you know exactly what's going into your food and can verify its freshness."}
{"text":"Don't care for the food too much although it's reasonable. I prefer their Mango Smoothies and I like that it's actually made with mango and not powder. Definitely recommend their tapioca is good and also generous"}
{"text":"If you love banh mi boyz, then you may have a hard time giving this place a chance. But, the 2 sandwiches ice tried were quite good.   1. Lemongrass chicken banh mi: flavours were good, and the baguette was nice and toasty.   2. Tofu and oyster mushroom bao: I loved the flavours for this one. Texture was lacking thought because everything was 'mushy' (the good kind)  I love banh mi boyz' made to order freshness. This is like the \"Subway Sandwiches\" version of that.  $7.50 a sandwich won't break the bank, and it's a nice option at Yorkdale. Give it try."}
{"text":"Have a little meat and a lot of vegetable in it with a unsuitable price. I choose mild spicy but that but a lot of chillies. In conclusion not good"}
{"text":"Newish Vietnamese sandwich shop at the food court across from the Eaton Centre. Very modern looking shop. I wonder if it's a chain?  I had two Bao (which can also be got as tacos). One was lemongrass chicken and the other bolgogi. It was 7.50 for both. They were decent but holy cilantro. They put a huge amount in. Maybe most people like a lot of cilantro but it was too much for me. Despite this ID come back to try the sandwiches and the pho."}
{"text":"This is by far my favorite food court spot at Yorkdale mall.    The tacos are my absolute favorite!! The taco shell is thin but it has a very nice texture to it. They let you adjust your spicy levels, but make sure to ask. Mild does not mean not spicy to them!! Mild = Sriracha, so if you can't really handle spicy, make sure you adjust to it accordingly.   I've had their bao, I feel like they don't stuff their baos as much as their tacos so I prefer the taco more.   Their sandwiches are really yummy. I had the pulled pork one, it contained a lot of onions. I know that the lemongrass pork and bulgogi is delicious!! I prefer those over the pulled pork but that's cause I don't like onions that much.   Their pho is small for their price, but the soup is super yummy and flavorful.   I had their bubble teas, it's made from powder and it's $4.99 for a pretty small size. I don't think their bubble teas are that worth it."}
{"text":"I typically eat their banh mi sandwiches or their asian sesame salad. Very tasty and nice offering compared to other things in the food court. I wouldn't necessarily try their specially drinks of pho because it is diluted. Id rather go to a real pho place where there soup base if boiled for hours"}
{"text":"Food court food delivered by uber eats...meh... it didnt work at all.  The irony of their \"fresh\" rolls is that they dont seem fresh at all. Tasted like it was made a day ago.  The bao was delicious but not filling and a bit too pricy for such a small portion. I enjoyed the \"taco\" as well...but i am 100% convinced they use paratha as the shell.  Probably never again- as they didnt even give me spoons and forks to eat thru Uber Eats."}
{"text":"Mediocre drinks. Expensive for the quality and quantity. Better to get che ba mau at another viet sub store."}
{"text":"MII Sandwich Co. is on the second floor of the food court inside Yorkdale Mall. The food court is always busy, so it's hard to find a seat. This place wasn't too busy. It's a western Vietnamese fusion fast-food restaurant.  I tried two different types of sandwiches, which is what they're known for. It was a different twist on the classic Viet sandwich. Basically, it was just different types of meat instead the usual sausage, ham or meatballs. There were 4 levels of spicy. I took the mild, which wasn't much. Hot had peppers in it, so it was quite spicy.  I tried the Caramelized Tiger Shrimps sandwich, which was more flavourful .. and had a bite of the Grilled Coconut Chicken sandwich, which had white meat but was a bit dry. Both were $7.49 + tax each. Overall it was good, but the portion doesn't justify the price. Maybe it was all that mall walking, but I was hungry again after an hour.  =/"}
{"text":"I'll give this place credit for being relatively good for food court fare, but I definitely prefer the baos/sandwiches from Banh Mi Boyz.   The bubble tea here is actually quite good though. They use fresh avocados for the avocado shake and the tapioca is well-made.   If you're looking for something different from the traditional burger or Chinese takeout food court joint, try this place out."}
{"text":"Very meh experience. Ordered the lemongrass chicken rice platter and found the chicken drabbed in too much sauce. The refreshing taste of lemongrass was easily lost.  Staff also very indifferent. The girl at the cashier looked like she was bored the hell out of her job. The guy who literally dropped the plate in my tray also couldn't be bothered to say anything."}
{"text":"Mii Sandwich Co. is a welcome addition to the Yorkdale Mall food court. Service was pretty quick despite the lineup. They offer four main types of entrees; sandwiches, tacos/baos, salads and pho (Vietnamese beef noodle soup). Prices are reasonable and comparable to typical food court fare; tacos and baos start at around $4-5, salads start at $6-7, sandwiches at $7 and pho at $8-9. All their drinks are currently $1 off with the purchase of any entr√©e.   Today, I tried the lemongrass chicken sandwich ($7) and the iced Vietnamese espresso with condensed milk ($4.50). The sandwich was piled generously with chicken, cucumbers, pickled carrots and daikon, cilantro and hoisin. They'll also ask how spicy you want your sandwich; mild, medium and spicy. I ordered medium, but it wasn't until I was halfway done the sandwich until I realized it wasn't spicy at all! Additionally, lemongrass flavour was nonexistent. However, I will forgive them because it's a new establishment, and the chicken was pretty good regardless. The baguette was crunchy on the outside and beautifully fluffy inside. The iced espresso was also really good; creamy, strong and flavourful. However, I felt that there was too much ice.   Although I didn't have the pho, the portion size looked generous and it came with the traditional sides; bean sprouts, basil leaves, lime, and hoisin and sriarcha sauce."}
{"text":"It was a surprise to see Mii Sandwich Co. In the place of our favorite grilled cheese fast food counter at Yorkdale. We haven't been in a while so I'm not sure how long Mii has been there.  We did give it a try as the baos looked like ones we had in Maui!  We ordered 4 as you get a better deal ordering them in pairs.  We tried the chicken, beef and pork.  All were generously portioned and delicious.  I didn't notice the lemongrass flavor though. We also had a bowl of pho which was good too. Some of the beef had a lot of tendons making it tough to chew though.  At the time they were handing out samples of their smoothies and bubble tea.  The mango tasted really yummy but the strawberry bubble tea was very artificial. We will be looking forward to trying some other menu items the next time we visit Yorkdale."}
{"text":"The coconut chicken bao and tofu and mushroom five spice bao were really good! Service was somewhat slow for the amount of people working there (4 or 5 employees) and there weren't a lot of people in line at the time. Other than the slow service, I'll definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"The food - pho, smoothie, soup, and noodles are great.The sauce/soup is delicious as well.    However, the customer service counter was not great. As soon as we finished our order the cashier started talking to another cashier and ignores us. The counter was quite big so I had to really lean over to get a straw and was trouble reaching. But no acknowledgement or help from her."}
{"text":"This place exceeds my expectation for a food court joint. I always order their bao and rare beef pho-- both are great by every standard."}
{"text":"Maybe it was my mistake for ordering their pho when their specialty is clearly sandwiches but why put anything on your menu if you can't execute it properly?  On the second floor of Yorkdale near Crate and Barrel in the food court lies this waste of real estate. All Vietnamese staff so I assumed good all around Vietnamese food but holy phuc I was wrong.   I ordered their MII special house pho which has their freakin name in the title and it was table flip worthy.   The bad: Fresh basil they served weren't fresh but was old and brown. The well done beef was tough as leather, could be used to make a LV purse and sell it downstairs. The noodles were as soggy as socks on a rainy day without shoes on. The beef balls were salty as.. balls. Assuming.. The soup was 1 dimensional and watered down almost.  The good:  It came out quickly.  Bad life choices."}
{"text":"I seem to come here a lot when I'm at Yorkdale. Why? I like their drinks:) the Logan drink is so refreshing and the Vietnamese desserts in a cup are a tasty treat. The apps and sandwiches are pretty tasty too. Pho was disappointing though. Very small portion, very bland tasting, did not satisfy my pho craving at all. You've been warned. Go for the fatty fried apps"}
{"text":"This was easily the worst sandwich I've eaten at a restaurant in Toronto, or any other city for that matter.   I got the coconut chicken combo with fries and an iced tea. To start, the fries tasted like they were boiled in water and had zero flavour to them. I ate maybe 5 before throwing in the towel on those.   I started the \"sandwich,\" which was essentially an untoasted, chalky French loaf cut open and sprinkled with low grade chicken and cilantro. Yum...  To top the experience off, I got to wash this abomination of a lunch down with a lukewarm iced tea.   I'd like to submit the attached pictures into evidence. Thanks for the times, MII!"}
{"text":"Decent pricing for food court, but somewhat overpriced if you think about how much banh mi's actually cost elsewhere, i.e. downtown.  However, you're not in Chinatown, you're in a busy ass food court in a mall.  It was $8.99+taxes for a banh mi (good size) + a sweetened lemonade.  I thought the drink was quite refreshing, whereas my sister took 1 sip and she thought it was too sweet!  I guess you can just wait for the ice to melt a bit.  Good quick(-ish) alternative at Dine on 3, especially after seeing the line at Chipotle.  My only criticism is that they'd be a bit more interactive with the customers.  They literally take your order, slowly take their time, make it, dump on tray, and see ya."}
{"text":"I'm from SD and I love their banh mis here!   We were looking for a quick snack and came across this place. We ordered 2 sandwiches, the meatballs on a stick, an avocado smoothie and a mango smoothie. It was all delicious and I def recommend this place for tourists visiting the mall.  The mango smoothie is a must have since it's super fresh. Best smoothie ever!"}
{"text":"Very expensive for a mall fast food joint. A bowl of pho here is $10. Most of the pho places that I've been to are less than $10 and far more delicious. But then again, maybe this place is expensive because it's in Yorkdale.  Now to the taste. The broth is SO SALTY. I have a high tolerance for salty and greasy foods but this place is just way too salty.  I did end up liking their smoothies and that I would recommend, hence the 3 star review here:"}
{"text":"For years I've been wanting to have Vietnamese sandwiches and/or pho at food courts and now I get both at one stop???!?   The restaurant is a cool concept and has a great selection to choose from (sandwiches, pho, tacos/bao,  salads, bubble tea). You can choose from three levels of heat: mild, medium, and spicy. Nothing is terribly expensive (less than $10). You can see their miinu and prices online at their website.   I tried the lemongrass pork sandwich to go and it was prepared quickly and in some very stylish packaging. The pork is tender and juicy, the bun was warm and crunchy, and the peppers were the perfect level of heat (for reference, I chose spicy).   It can be difficult to get your food because the prep area is a little confusing and chaotic at times, but wait times aren't anything to worry about.   I'm excited to see mii around more often and hopefully get to try more of its miinu!"}
{"text":"The first thing I saw was... They gave lotsa rice on your plate. There is good basic variety which includes pho, rice and bahn mi to choose from. Drinks is also a hard choice when there's great variety.  The cashier was very knowledgeable and at ease recommending when you ask for an opinion and what to order.   I ordered the lemongrass pork & chicken rice that comes with a side salad. The portions are certainly good. But there's lacking of lemongrass taste in the sauce. Considered that it's fast- food in a foodcourt. Can't complain much! ."}
{"text":"I was craving pho at Yorkdale yesterday and just my luck I came across this place, brand new so I gave it a try. Got the pho & taco combo. extra $2 to upgrade the pho from a small to regular size. So that's $10.99 for the combo. I'd definitely come back, it's as good as the typical pho franchise restaurants around the city."}
{"text":"Food: 3 stars Normally wouldn't get pho at a food court but gave this place a shot.  $8.99 for the pho and I was told it only comes in one size. Pho was not bad and came with the usual bean sprouts, basil leaves, and lime. Their one size is about a medium at most pho restaurants. I substituted the beef balls for more beef slices. Got about 5-6 palm-sized slices. Beef is lean but not tough. Soup base was pretty good.   Store front: 4  stars Bright yellow store signage. Clean and bright store front. Pretty eye-catching.   Service: 3 stars There was no line-up so we were served quickly."}
{"text":"I know it's call MII sandwich but nevermind the sandwiches I want my damn PHO! Wanted Pho for the longest time!  Thank God MII is here to the rescue.  Especially, I need my energies before my Sunday hockey.   MII is located in the food court. What really caught my eyes was actually the rice salad roll loll but then I honed in onto the smell of pho ... Much like a fat kid with an ice cream cone :)  Usually I won't get pho at a mall food court but they have a combo $8.99 (pho + rice roll) and I couldn't resist.  I'd recommend this if you are in the mall. Pho is pretty good. The portion is fair and I can watch them make it fresh.  As for the rice roll, it was a bit dry, but that's also because it's made well head (probably in the morning)   I'd give it 3.5 stars .... Service was pretty good tho for a mall stall."}
{"text":"We got 2 baos coconut chicken and korean beef plus one avocado milkshake. Love them wahahahaha"}
{"text":"The worst. Very, very poor attempt at Vietnamese food. My beef taco had three teeny weeny pieces of meat. My chicken bao also had 3 pieces of artificial tasting chicken. And it cost way more than banh mi should. This is by far the worst banh mi sandwich place in Toronto. The pho had a faint resemblance to real pho."}
{"text":"Had the beef ball and rare beef pho noodle soup and fresh chicken wraps in rice paper.  Great taste, portion and fragrance.  Fast serve and friendly staff."}
