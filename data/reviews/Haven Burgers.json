{"text":"I absolutely love this burger place! The California burger (which I always purchase) is always juicy and freshly made, contains a load of veggies. I want to compare this place to a high end burger joint but the price point makes me want to compare it to a fast food chain. If you're on the edge of trying this place just do it and you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"What can I say about Haven , one of the best hamburgers I've ever had. The \" Haven burger\" is the bomb. Good food, good price. I would recommend it to everyone."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic!  I absolutely love atmosphere, the people that own/run it are great and very friendly.  My young son constantly asks to go there for dinner and has fun joking around with the people behind the counter.  Anytime we're not sure what to do for dinner, we end up here!"}
{"text":"I definitely love their California burger.  pretty good place for good bite. Small , friendly not a fast place but it doesnt take them long either.  Try it!"}
{"text":"Southern California style burgers and pastrami sandwiches! I have been in AZ for a little under a year and I missed the hamburger stand type food you can find all over Los Angeles so when I found this place I felt right at home!! Delicious food and really nice staff. New favorite place!"}
{"text":"The Haven burger is excellent. This could be the best quick food burger I've had. Very flavorful and cooked to perfection. I had a egg, bacon & cheese sandwich here a few months ago that was equally as good. Please support this restaurant that is trying to survive the light rail construction. It's well worth the traffic hassle."}
{"text":"This place is great. Good food and good service. Clean and straight forward location. One of the best pastrami sandwiches I've eaten. Price is decent for the good quality of food you get too."}
{"text":"The California Burger is by FAR the best burger! This burger spot beats In & Out and all the other great burger joints!  The zucchini fries are so tasty as well & My kids love their chicken tenders and fries too! The staff there are always friendly and patient with our big orders and they always get the order right!!!   Only downfall we wish they were open Sundays:)"}
{"text":"I went here because my dad said he heard it was good. When I went on Saturday around noon, it was PACKED. Now, being in the service industry, I understand that sometimes you want people to order and get done with it, but there's no reason to be rude. My dad asks everyone the same question all the time, \"what is the biggest meal you serve?\" The guy at the cash register just blew him off and told him to order. Then he messed up said order. The food was good. Not great. The burger was dry and it had no condiments. I won't be returning."}
{"text":"I didn't have their famous burgers, but my carne asada burrito was very tasty. It was busy at lunch, which tells you a lot about the place: people like it. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Haven Burger is heaven sent!  I've been searching for a hometown burger place for 5 years.  Suddenly I found one walking distance from my house!!  Many restaurants failed in this location, but they didn't have Tony!!  Tony owns this burger joint.  The burgers taste old fasioned, the fries are crispy outside and fluffy on the inside and the service feels like your eating with family.  The Haven signature has pastrami on the burger and thousand island on the toasted bun.  Everything on the menu is worth trying.  All the customers leave happy with promises of returning.  And They Do!!   I gotta eat here at least once a week.  YOU HAVE TO TRY HAVEN BURGER!"}
{"text":"My husband recently placed a to go order from here and didn't really think much about the price until we looked at the receipt after he arrived home. Our bill came to $38 but when we did the math our bill should have only been around $30. We were completely overcharged. We tried calling and could never get through. Definitely will not be going back."}
{"text":"I have always loved pastrami burgers since I first tried one at Crown Burger in Utah.  I thought that taste might never come to Arizona, but Haven Burgers is here.  Their signature pastrami ( Haven ) burger is a great cheese burger with pastrami piled on top.  They also have this in a Haven Melt which is also very good.  They have a California burger with avocado that is great.  Their fries are very good and they have homemade onion rings which are fantastic.  There are a lot of other menu items as well as breakfast items that I can't wait to try.  Haven Burgers will make your burger any way you can dream up.  They have the soda machine out by the customers and drink refills are free.  The owner if often there and he really cares that you're pleased with your meal.  This is a new culinary gem in the east valley that caters to those looking for great inexpensive food!  Guy Fieri needs to find this place and spotlight them on \"Drive-ins, Diners and Dives\"."}
{"text":"I was passing by and saw the sign that said $4.99 for a burger combo deal. We decided to give it a try. The burgers/fries were BEYOND delicious! Everything was made to order and you can see the cook prepare your meal. The owners are very friendly! The restaurant is very clean and kid-friendly. A locally owned restaurant that prepares delicious food for a very reasonable price. What more could you ask for? I cannot wait to go back again! :)"}
{"text":"I never give 5 star's to a food place but this place is that good.  We found this place on yelp and enjoyed the atmosphere and mostly the burgers.  The owner and his family take pride in the place and it shows in the food. It's clean love the table tops lol"}
{"text":"Went for lunch and although I did eat all my food I wont be back. I had the avocado burger and my lunch partner had the California burger.  I expected a bigger patty. It was borderline where's the beef. 

Im not a fan of shredded lettuce and my tomato was slightly grainy. 

Just trying to keep it real."}
{"text":"I came here for the 1st time today. It was awesome. The food was great. Fast service. The place was busy and still managed to get my son and i served fast. He tried the pastrami burger. That was amazingly awesome. Thank you guys"}
{"text":"Cheeseburger, fries and a drink for $7. Solid meal for the price. They do have a parking lot in front of their place (they are just outside of downtown Mesa). They also offer breakfast (burritos, omelets, sandwiches, etc). Kids meals $4. The owner is on site and really cares about making sure you are taken care of properly."}
{"text":"I am so done with this place! This is the third time I've shown up to a closed Haven Burgers during their \"business\" hours.  Burgers are good but not worth the annoyance, waste of time and gas. Seems like the owner changes hours of operation like he changes his underwear. Note to all: they now close at 5pm on Mondays."}
{"text":"Definitely a spot worth supporting. A little taste of southern Cali with the pastrami sandwiches!"}
{"text":"Definitely a very average hamburger--nothing exciting about it. Not to mention several things in our order were wrong. For the price I can think of many other places I would rather go to get a burger! :)"}
{"text":"Words can't describe how great this place is and the people that work here are just as good."}
{"text":"Found on Yelp, had good ratings. Clicked on website which led me to some weight loss thing.  I tried calling to verify they were still open- phone message stated call couldn't be taken.  Went anyways and it was open.  Looked like it was going to be pretty good.  Got a cheeseburger meal.  Their pop machine is cool, has lots of flavors.  My burger meal was about $8 and some change.  The fries are the frozen bag kind.  The burger is on a sesame bun.  The burger was okay.  Nothing amazing. Basic.  I won't be back only because there's more flavor to be had. Also- I wanted to wash my hands and needed a key on a big stick to get in. Made me feel like my hands just got dirty again holding the stick."}
{"text":"Great burgers (I got the California burger & my husband for the bacon cheeseburger) great service & super friendly. The guy that took our order was really nice & even chatted with us during our meal a little. We will definitely be back here again!"}
{"text":"They're made to order. Great juicy patty qualityn fresh  l-ove their ranch    I love the jalapeno burger , California one too. They're kind of hidden but worth finding. They are not cheap but like supporting local businesses. Check them out"}
{"text":"Ham burger combo. 8 bucks really great pastrami on a burger. Fries could use an upgrade.but the burger was amazing! And a drink. Great price"}
{"text":"Tried the Haven Burger combo. I was pleasantly surprised by how good it was. That is a great feeling isn't it!?
The pastrami on the burger was perfect and full of flavor. It was made just the way I like a good burger. Really enjoyed the fries with ranch as well. May need to order two sides of ranch next time.
I'm sitting here looking at the menu and I can already tell I will be back to try more and if it's anything like what I had today then it's got to be good!
The place is clean and in a good location. Good service and they were helpful with my questions I had about the menu.
I will be back!"}
{"text":"Best burger in Arizona.  Try the fried zucchini.  Wash that down with some Orange Crush."}
{"text":"All I can say is legit, legit, legit! Based on only their burgers this place rocks. Friendly staff, great portion size and clean environment. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Southern California style burger, not much else to say. It's like Yellow Basket, or Tommy's, or Monk's, Ted's, you know the drill."}
{"text":"Love the California burger
.avacado cheese onions.. great grill toasted flavors.  The owners are very personable
Always clean."}
{"text":"I love this place! It reminds me of back home (California)  and the Miss Lady at the cashier is super friendly love her!"}
{"text":"Cool little place. Fun guys working here.  Food is good. I would recommend it.  I had the chili burger with everything and loved it.  The onion rings were good as well."}
{"text":"Man this place is great.  Best burger in town, and HANDS-DOWN best pastrami.  They do their burgers on a flat top grill, best for burgers imho.  They also have great fried zucchini; it's in spears and the zucchini is still a bit firm when it comes out.  The fries are crispy and their ranch is the good kind.
A must try if you're looking for a good pastrami joint.
The owner or manager guy is friendly and takes good care of the business.  Other employees are positive and friendly.  The place is clean.  Only complaint is that it gets super packed, I couldn't even go here during a week lunch time.  No seats and no parking.  But it's busy for a reason!  I love you Haven Burgers!"}
{"text":"Really liked this place. I had the Haven burger and it was very tasty. The service was very friendly too. I will be back."}
{"text":"In town for work so I was looking for somewhere local. Had a double cheeseburger and onions rings and they were both really good. Like the special sauce on the burger."}
{"text":"Great family run hamburger joint! Fresh burgers made to order. The fried zucchini is to die for! Chili cheese fries are the best around! Great prices. So lucky I found this place!"}
{"text":"Excellent food! great price! My shop loves to eat there!
Friendy fast service!

{"text":"Love this local, non-chain, burger joint. The Haven Burger is delicious (burger with pastrami and 1000 Island dressing). The onion rings are great as well. Looking for a true mom and pop burger joint, look no further. And the prices are good as well."}
{"text":"Such an awesome place to go eat!! Decent prices for quite a bit of food. I got the haven burger and it is fantastic!! Easily one of the best burgers I've had. I would definitely recommend this burger spot to anyone!"}
{"text":"Terrific hamburgers, this place is family owned and makes some of the best hamburgers I have had in a long time. There chili dog and onion rings was not so good though. But, Ill defiantly be back for the burgers and fries."}
{"text":"I tried Haven awhile back, late evening. I got the regular cheeseburger with their house sauce - it was good. Lots of fresh fries. I will try again."}
{"text":"Great service and the food is amazing.  Best burgers in town. The rib eye sandwich is my favorite.  Great variety of burritos ane more."}
{"text":"We came to this location about 830pm it was packed. The food was delivered ASAP to us. At first I was a little worried about trying out the food because of my past experience with other place. I order the haven burger which can describe it in one word amazing. The food and great fresh taste was incredible. I live two blocks away from this place and past by it everyday. My wife suggested to eat dinner and try something new. There is no doubt I will come to this place over and over the guy at the cashier was really friendly and happy to see customers."}
{"text":"Good food with good prices.  They have a little of everything.  I really enjoy their burgers and always must get a order of fried zucchini.  They do theirs as spears, instead of slices and this makes them juicy!"}
{"text":"After reading a lot of good reviews on Yelp, we tried Haven Burgers on Main Street in Mesa. South side of Main Street adjacent to Pioneer Park, across the street from the Dairy Queen. It was a huge disappointment. Nothing is better than a great hamburger but the people who rated Haven Burgers have a much different concept than I do of what makes a great burger. To suit my taste, the burger has to be thick (about an inch). You can not make up for a thin paddy by stacking a few of them on top of each other. If your burger patty is not at least an inch thick, you're just McDonald's by another name. Cardboard still tastes like cardboard when stacked in layers.
If I don't get asked, how I want my hamburger cooked, I know I'm in just another fast food \"restaurant\". For me, the paddy has to have some thickness and the option of ordering it cooked medium rare has to be there. Haven Burgers slops some thousand island dressing on the burgers. The only way a new customer can know this is to order a burger and learn that \"that's how it comes\" after picking up the order at the counter and sitting down to eat it.
For my taste, I need my hamburger served cooked-to-order and presented to me on just a naked bun. They have to either give me the condiments I choose on the side, or there has to be a condiment bar with uniform SLICES of onion (preferably red), sliced tomatoes, fresh, crisp, vibrant whole leaves of lettuce, and I want to apply my own mayo and mustard in the amounts I choose. Pickle slices are welcome but in a perfect world, I would have a crunchy kosher pickle wedge on the side to munch along with the burger. I really don't mind paying considerably more for a great hamburger. You get what you pay for.
If I had been hungry and just stumbled across Haven Burgers, I would have said it was \"fine\". That was not the case. We left home with Haven Burgers as our single intended destination because of the high ratings and reviews on Yelp upon which I have been relying for at least six years. I love Yelp.
AZ88 in Scottsdale serves the best hamburgers for my taste. They've got it right. I used to love Bill Johnson's as a great place to get a hamburger but they closed down. There was a Lone Star Steak House in Mesa that served a great hamburger for my taste, but they closed. Oddly enough, Denny's does a pretty good job close to suiting my taste on their hamburgers.
One final thing I will say about Haven Burgers is that, even though we did not go during a busy time at all and there were a lot of employees for such a small place, the fellow who took our order and seemed to be the boss, came off a little impatient. There seemed to be an attitude in there that they were doing us a favor by allowing us to come in and order some food.
No, I would see no reason to return to Haven Burger with a McDonald's on every corner. BTW, I hate McDonald's but McDonald's is just as good as Haven Burger."}
{"text":"Always fresh n cooked to perfection. The Only LA Cali burger stand in Az that comes with cheese burgers n pastrami burgers. N fried zucchini is Bombay!!! Must try the Haven burger!!!! Reminds me of home"}
{"text":"Great food served by great people. A fantastic family owned joint. The menu is pretty large: pitas, burgers, sandwiches, and burritos. The haven burger was AMAZING. The perfect amount of pastrami and burger with a tasty sauce. It's a bit pricier than places like in-n-out but the quality of food is worth it. I can't wait to go back and try something else!"}
{"text":"Mediocre food, slightly better than mediocre service. The cashier got our order wrong, and when we sent it back she got the order wrong AGAIN. Besides that, the hamburger patty was way too thin for the bun it came in, and the taste reminded me of a Burger King hamburger. We also sent the fries back, as the fries had been overcooked then left to become cool. Gross. NOT coming back. Recommend in & out, 5 Guys, or Red Robin if you are serious about your hamburger."}
{"text":"The first time I tried Haven Burger, I was on a search for the best burger to be found in the East Valley.  I ordered the titular Havenburger, a 1/2 lb patty topped with what seemed like at least 3 lbs worth of Pastrami.  It was definitely in the top five burgers I've had in my life.  Juicy, tender, the pastrami added a wonderful flavor, and the dressing added a moistness to balance out all the meat.  I was certainly full from just this fantastic sandwich...and I'm sure I could have slept a week with all that meat in my belly...but then I tried a fry.  The fries are crispy and awesome.  A lot of restaurants relegate fries and onion rings to the realm of \"sides,\" but Haven Burger treats all the details of their platings with equal respect.  Nothing fancy, but just plain good.  Since then, I've discovered their chili dogs, which I crave often.  
The service is beyond fantastic. The owner is usually working, and he recognizes me and asks where my buddy is (this being sometimes months between visits.)  He always has time to chat and let us know how much he appreciates the business.  
Honestly, this place is the epitome of what a privately owned business should be.  Friendly service, great food made with attention to details, a quirky quiet atmosphere...this place should be called \"Heaven Burger!\""}
{"text":"Had the haven burger. Would have been great if I liked onions! This burger has enough onions on it for 5 burgers. Onions where not mentioned or listed in the description of the burger.  If you are not an onion fan or have an onion allergy, make sure you tell them to hold the onion or else you will be eating an onion burger with some meat! Everyone in my party had to remove all or some of the onions because they overpowered everything.

The restaurant is very dirty. Had a hard time eating the onion burger in the dirty smelly atmosphere. Bathrooms were bad and looked as if they had not been cleaned recently. 

The staff was friendly and were really the only decent part of the experience. If it was not for the whole onion on the burger, the very very dirty restaurant and bathrooms it would  have been an ok burger joint."}
{"text":"Ordered Haven Burger, very good service is great would come back here again. Did I mention I drove from Apache Junction to try the Haven Burger. Being born & raised in So California  (Whittier ), I sure do miss California Style Burgers. Only those from So Cal know what I'm talking about."}
{"text":"First time I have been here, recommended by my father in law. Delicious! I ordered their jalapeño burger. It was very good. Place was very clean. Friendly staff, nice and family oriented. My sonand my husband enjoyed their meals too. Great food, good prices."}
{"text":"Outstanding fresh burgers. Good onion rings. So full right now, I can barely move. I should have cut it in half. We've been here many times. I get the jalapeño burger, she gets the bacon cheeseburger, and we split an order of onion rings. Great burger every time. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Double cheese was on point. I have wanted to try this place for a while. Friendly staff fast service. I'll be back"}
{"text":"Love love love this place. I'm fortunate to live right across the street so I can stuff my face with their delicous burgers anytime. :)"}
{"text":"Great food.  Nice employees.  Nice little gem near the LDS temple, Pioneer Park and downtown."}
{"text":"We had steak sandwich, pastrami burger and jalapeño burger. All the food was mediocre. Service was fast but I wouldn't come again."}
{"text":"I've eaten here before and I always try to support local businesses but  the owner/cook won't make my food the way I want. He was yells at his employee (non English speaking undocumented worker) then a server is screaming the whole time sitting at the bar making the environment stressful and tense we won't be back. A lot like southern Cali restaurants just super unprofessional."}
{"text":"We enjoy the burger with pastrami. Nice yummy taste. Nice little burger joint with a try. Their quesadillas aren't great but the burger are good."}
{"text":"I really enjoy this place. People are very friendly and nice. Everything is made fresh to order. The havenburger is really good. My wife gets the breakfast burrito with sausage egg, potato and cheese. It is one of the best breakfast burritos I have ever had. I like to support local restaurants and this is one I would like to stay around so please support them and give them a try. Maybe come by after or before a temple session!"}
{"text":"I think the best part about the food is the fact that it is an open grill and the hamburgers put off the aroma of a backyard grilling. The food was fantastic, only real problem that I had was that the burgers were 1/4 pounders before cooked and were a little small. But the price and food was great"}
{"text":"The wife and I ordered for delivery via GrubHub. I'd heard good things and the reviews were solid, so maybe we just caught this place on an off day. However, the experience overall was pretty negative. They forgot half my order and an hour later, I'm still waiting for the restaurant to get back to me. The food itself wasn't bad, but I could honestly approximate it by getting Carl's Jr. for 50% less hassle. The ingredients themselves were fresh, but the actual execution was pretty slapdash. All in all, a disappointment."}
{"text":"This place is small, but they serve a mean hamburger!  All are grilled on the spot, they have a large variety to choose from and the fried zucchini is to die for!

My family has tried from the basic burger to the California, avocado and Haven burgers and all have been fantastic!  Service is quick, and place is clean.  Great for family dinners."}
{"text":"My husband and I wanted to try some place new. We see this place when we go to the Tempe at Christmas time. We figured we would try it. It was awesome!!! Good was cooked perfect, good prices and very friendly. I loved it when I went to get my drink I noticed a picture of what I believe is grandma with her grandkids, it shows they are family people. The one man their brings your food to your table, and talks to everyone their. We will be back."}
{"text":"My favorite burger joint in Mesa.  Reminds me of Angelo's in southern California.  Highly recommend this place..."}
{"text":"Our first time here, we've been looking for a great char-broiled burger place since moving from So. Cal. Now we have the go to place for what we want...a proper char burger, fries & coke for a price that doesn't break the bank ! We will DEFINITELY be coming back for more."}
{"text":"I like haven burger for their fresh ingredients and friendly staff. Being family owned and operated business they provide personal service that you can't get anywhere else. Their food is some of the best in the area."}
{"text":"The BEST Pastrami around. Great burgers and fries too. Super friendly and fast. Love this place for my Pastrami fix. Get some fried zucchini too. I'm a regular and you will be too. Support the little guy and come here often. 

Thanks guys."}
{"text":"I was in the area and super hungry and wanted something stat. 

I pulled in, not expecting much, but I was very glad I came in. The food was BOMB. 

I had their Haven Burger. Who knew pastrami on hamburger meat would go so nicely together. I don't eat flour-based products so I didn't eat the bun with the burger, but it was still good. I know if I had eaten the bun it would have been really good. (After hearing about \"Wheat Belly\", I've stopped eating that stuff). I'd recommend it! 

The woman, who I believe was the owner, was very nice. She was definitely a good sales woman. I was going to just order the burger, but she said \"I had\" to try the Haven Burger because it was better. 

It was lunch time so it was pretty busy. I'm glad to see that though because it is a mom-and-pop shop. 

I'm not really in this area, but if I were I'd come  back!"}
{"text":"Great burgers, great salads, excellent onion rings, fast service, friendly people.  This is definitely on my list to visit again next time I'm in town.  Thanks, Haven Burgers!"}
{"text":"I drove 7 miles to try this joint and I wasn't disappointed. The California Burger was good (I made it a double). The onion rings were really good. Downside? Small portions with the o-rings. And the price was a little high. I will definitely come back. My total out the door about $12.50."}
{"text":"These burgers are delish! A litte hole in the wall with great burgers and great service. Try their french fries and onion rings too. This is the closest to a 'California' style burger as you'll get out in AZ."}
{"text":"I was looking for a place for lunch today in Mesa, and decided to try something new.  Haven Burger came up as an interesting option.  I had never heard of it; it's a local spot right across from the temple.  I knew this is a sketchy neighborhood, so I didn't know what to expect - but place actually looks nice and clean, inside and out.

The setup looks very similar to another locally owned burger joint, the popular Giant Hamburger.  The grill is right behind the counter, so you can see them cooking the food, just as at Giant.  It's small, with something like 4-5 tables and a similar number of booths.

I went with their signature Haven Burger combo.  The burger is topped with lettuce, tomatoes, pastrami, and thousand island dressing.

Another similarity to Giant: you're basically eating fast food, but it's not fast at all.  Sure, the wait isn't quite as long as you'd get at a gourmet burger joint, but don't expect to sit down and start eating right away.  This isn't a knock on the place, but something you should expect.

As far as the food is concerned, it's very good for a fast food burger.  The pastrami and thousand island dressing really work on the burger.  The quality of the ingredients is not what you would expect at a gourmet burger joint, so don't expect a nice, thick, juicy patty cooked medium-rare with thick-sliced pastrami.  It's just good enough to make this an excellent fast food burger.

The drinks offered are standard Pepsi products. (They give you one free refill, although I don't know that they're strict on this.  You shouldn't drink that much soda anyways!)  They also have horchata and jamaica (no refills), but I didn't get them, so I don't know how they rate.

The single biggest problem with this place is no doubt the fries.  These are freezer fries, not fresh cut.  They were really not good fries - I regretted not getting the thousand island or ranch dressing to dip them in ($0.30 extra).  Some vinegar would also help a lot; I didn't see any vinegar anywhere, but I didn't ask, either.  If they don't improve their fries, it'll be hard to justify eating here over one of the popular mid-range burger chains (Five Guys, Smashburger, etc.) where they actually have tasty fries.

Overall, I'd rate this a step above Giant, two steps above your average fast food burger (Burger King or Wendy's), and a step below Five Guys and Smashburger.  If they were to improve their fries, they might be able to move up to that next tier. (Their prices are more reasonable, though, so if you're budget-conscious, this may be a better option.)

Haven Burgers is a reasonable place to eat if you're in the neighborhood, or you're on a budget and want something better than Burger King.  But don't add it to your list of destination burger joints."}
{"text":"So far the closest tasting pastrami sandwich from California..Very good!! Totally recommend!"}
{"text":"Went here at 8:00 on a Friday and they were closed, employees juststanding around. Sure, I'm hangry as hell as I write this, but it clearly said open till 9:00 on the door."}
{"text":"My husband really liked his burger. For me, it was just too big to be manageable, but that's personal preference. The service was very very friendly, which always makes the experience more enjoyable."}
{"text":"Had been wanting to try this place for a long time and finally did.  It was hard to try because I kept wanting to eat there on a Sunday and they aren't open.  Fast food that isn't *that* fast - no drive through and the service is quick to take your order but slower to prepare the food.  I guess that is a good thing!  Tried the pastrami sandwich.  Good size - lots of chopped up and fried up meat on a hoagie roll with spicy mustard and pickles.  It was just okay.... I wouldn't have it again.  Also tried the cheeseburger and fries.  Also just okay."}
{"text":"While waiting an eternity at stop light to stop light on Main St. rush hour I started checking nearby bookmarks and feeling defeated because I had passed them all checked the nearby option and saw this place and pictures of Pastrami. Sold. After a few more lights I finally made it into the hard to access plaza(coming in and leaving depending on your destination) and into this place. The staff was friendly and there were a bunch of people waiting on orders so I was amazed how fast I got my food. I got the combo with the Pastrami sandwich which was almost not even need except for the drink on the hot day because the sandwich is huge. Its salty and spicy with the mustard slathered in there and the pickles brighten everything up between bites. When they say California style they really do remind me of a spot right by my aunt's place in Anaheim right down to the menu."}
{"text":"Honestly one of the worst places I have ever eaten. They employees were extremely nice, and I love little places like this, so I wish I liked it. I'm so confused why it has 4 out of 5 stars. People were going off about the zucchini fries...they were terrible. Way too thick. Burgers were about the same quality as a McDonald's dollar menu burger"}
{"text":"I had a Haven Burger. I have been waiting for a pastrami burger place to open up in my area for a while, fell in love with www.crown-burgers.com years ago. Also a plus is that they \"grill fire\" the burger too. It was not as big as pastrami burgers I have had at other places, but then again, it was a little less money too. Very tasty. I'm gonna be the mayor, check foursquare and see."}
{"text":"Local mom and pop joint and wanted to eat from roasting @ Spring Training game. Had the California burger no bun and it was awesome with avocado, lettuce, tomato, cheese, bacon. So good I had another one in 5 minutes."}
{"text":"Pros:
Food is good. I always order the California burger. Service is good. 
Cons:
They advertise their breakfast, but they don't open until 10AM. They're closed on Sunday. 
That's why I only gave them 3 stars. If it wasn't for that I would give them 4."}
{"text":"Nice local burger shop. Food was good. I had a bacon cheeseburger combo, it included a fountain drink and thick cut fries. Excellent quality. Good bun. Fries were good. No complaints. However, they have a big menu (lots of delicious sounding things!) and there are no descriptions of what each item is. But whatever, its a nice place, local ownership, and its quality."}
{"text":"The best burgers in town!!!! These are California style burgers. The bread.....just everything"}
{"text":"Not the best burger. Pastrami was extremely fatty. Frozen pre-made burgers and fries. Search for gourmet burger doesn't mean frozen, it means made fresh to me."}
{"text":"I had the haven burger combo and she had a BLT.  Mine had pastrami on it and is a good sized burger.  It is flavorful and I would definitely order that again.   She said the BLT was ok.  White bread, mayo and of course BLT.  
The fries were thick cut.  I got some that had been cooked before we walked in, so although they weren't bad they might have been better if fresh.  
The drinks are from one of the new machines that does scores of different flavors. 
Overall,  I think this little shop has good food for a good price and I would return."}
{"text":"I was looking on Yelp for a new place to get a burger. I saw this and thought I'd give it a try.  The reviews for the pastrami sandwich were very good so I decided to have that with fries instead of a burger. My friend had the double chili cheeseburger with onion rings.  The pastrami sandwich was delicious. So much meat I could only eat half. The fries were so good. Crispy on the outside and perfectly cooked on the inside.   My friend really enjoyed her chili cheeseburger and onion rings. Service was quick. We hit it at the right time. As we were leaving there was a line out the door. We both decided we would go back and maybe try the breakfast items.  Yes they serve breakfast until 11:30.  So it's not just a burger joint.  Lots of good menu choices."}
{"text":"Great mom and pop place for a Saturday afternoon burger.   

Driving through a part of town I hadn't been in a long time abs saw the sign,  figured what the heck.  I'm so glad I gave it a shot.  

Welcomed as soon as I walked in by the staff.  Ordered up the haven burger that comes with pastrami.  Was cooked up to order perfectly,  served up juicy and hot.  The kind of burger that melts in your mouth delicious.  

For about 8 bucks total got a great sized burger,  piled with meat and pastrami,  fries and a drink.  For just a buck or 2 more than fast food I got an amazing burger, done perfect,  by friendly people.  

I'm glad I stopped in, look forward to coming back.  I highly recommend haven burger to anyone who enjoys a great burger at great price."}
{"text":"The people we were with thought this was the best burger place in town and given the name you would have thought so.  For me it was just OK.  Nothing special about the meat, or the bun.  They did have crinkle cut fries.  Maybe I should have tried something else."}
{"text":"Honestly the best burger I've had in Arizona!Also,the owner is very nice and down to earth.He made my fiancé and I feel very at home.I love the decor,GO RAMS!!!"}
{"text":"The burgers are so delicious. 
They are large and they have a great homemade touch to it! 
I got the jalapeño added with bacon it was perfection and it was very spicy not a hint it was For real spicy. It's worth my money and the cozy diner type feel has me wanting to come back. 

Also please get Fried zucchini it's to die for"}
{"text":"I took my grandchildren on a light rail transit adventure from downtown Phoenix to Mesa, where we found Haven Burger! These \"picky eaters\" ate everything, including all of my fries. Haven was very busy when we arrived, but the owner greeted us and took our order promptly, and even engaged the kids in conversation. Our lunch was up within a few minutes, and I loved the Haven burger with pastrami! Moist and delicious ! 
A huge plus to me is the cleanliness of the place, every single employee paying attention to detail. Yes, the rest room is for customers only, and clean.
I love my \"triple d \" places, street food, trucks, etc. I DO appreciate it when it's immaculate. Good job, Haven Burger!"}
{"text":"Not bad at all......great little place for Breakfast not a dive by any means but not 5 star by any means but no complaints on my end, it is a quick and split.  If you're in the area and want Mel's Diner (telling my age) this the go to place. ;)"}
{"text":"Always good burgers. Very friendly owner and staff. Clean place. Clean restroom. Outdoor seating. Quick service. Fair prices."}
{"text":"If you have ever had a Crown Burger in Utah and crave them, the Haven Burger is an even better burger. The pastrami is amazing and the burger is perfectly cooked over a flame. The fries and onion rings were good as well. I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"My wife and I went here for the first time this weekend and we loved it. I found it on Yelp and it didn't disappoint. Staff was friendly and the service was fast. The burgers were amazing. 

My wife ordered the Haven Burger (burger with pastrami on it) and I order a boulder cheeseburger with bacon(60 cents extra) and jalapeños (40 cents extra). Both were cooked well and were so tasty. The fires were hot and seemed like they were just cooked. If you are in the area and are sick of McDonalds or other places try it out!"}
{"text":"I am picky when it comes to my burgers so I won't be over critical.  For the price you pay, I thought the Haven Burger was pretty good and the fries were nice a crispy.  The owner was walking around talking with us and was very personable which added to the service.  Atmosphere is about what you expect with a hole-in-the-wall burger place.  All in all pretty good and worth a visit."}
{"text":"(Lyrics - Warrant - Heaven)

I've got a review for your place
As I'm order the Haven Burger
It's sweet and moist and salty
and it's looking pretty good
See the pastrami in the mix
Thousand Island dressing on the bun
The zucchini fries are great, but don't forget about fries

I know you want to be the king of Mesa
As long as you're the hero of this burger joint

Haven burger isn't too far away
(ahhhhhh)
Its open almost everyday
No matter what your reviews might say

Haven Burger is located close to downtown Mesa.  My friends kept on saying they didn't want to \"get stabbed\"!  I didn't think it was that bad!  Then again we were just walking around looking for a place to eat.  

Not particularly sure where the Haven name came from, but I decided to order their specialty anyways along with zucchini fries -- yum!  I love me some zucchini fries anytime over regular fries.  However, their fries were thick and crispy so no complaints.  Love, love, love zucchini fries didn't I mention!!  They were perfectly done here with a side of ranch!  My Haven burger was different from what I'm used to.  Pastrami in a burger!?  Yep, and guess what, it works.  The salty pastrami really gave some pop to the burger while the Thousand Island dressing almost reminded me of a big mac.  

Overall, the place looks like taco dive, but they serve burgers of course.  Service came with a smile and they were totally friendly and attentive.  Definitely, recommend a stop by if you're ever in Mesa and no we didn't get stabbed....Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Great burger, the almighty haven burger! The staff is very nice and the haven burger is definitely one of my faves! I usually switch the ranch for ketchup and mustard for a more standard burge."}
{"text":"I was anxious to try this place because it was recommended to me and the reviews were great. I arrived just after a very large party so I knew there would be a wait. I was not expecting someone to steal my order. Tony was VERY apologetic and when I went to buy some onion rings he gave them to me for free. 

The burger tasted decent but the patty was small. It felt like they had to overcompensate with the toppings. The fries were okay, the onion rings not to my liking. It was very overpriced all together. It was a disappointing experience. The only great thing about it was Tony who was very nice!!!"}
{"text":"Best pastrami burgers in the west.  This small corner burger joint is worth the trip.  Don't let the neighborhood fool you, they will not disappoint. This has become our family burger favorite replacing Five Guys...hands down a much better burger.  Get the haven burger combo and fry sauce and you will be back."}
{"text":"Amazing! Best burgers and nice family! Probably one of the few places that actually makes everything seemed homemade but in the best and most easy way possible."}
{"text":"Amazing food, great service! This place is a great find in west Mesa. Everything is made fresh and the thousand island dressing is amazing!"}
{"text":"Had to give this place five stars the service was excellent and the food was phenomenal they greet you when you come in the door and they say goodbye to you as you're leaving who could want anything more"}
{"text":"Excellent pastrami burgers.  I've never been disappointed here and the service is always fairly quick and friendly."}
{"text":"First time here so I tried the Haven burger my other half raves about. I'm REALLY glad I did! Lots of flavor and more than enough food to satisfy!

I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"The best burgers in town! Gyros too! Don't forget the California fries- fries, chili, pastrami and cheese! Support local."}
{"text":"If you want great food and even better customer service eat here. The owners treat everyone like they are friends. We travel from Anthem to Mesa just to have their food. It is our favorite place to eat. The only thing they serve that is bad would be their choice in a football team...Haha! GO CARDS!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Friendly local burger shop. Very low prices. They were glad to customize my burger replacing the onions with onion rings. Great for an affordable lunch during spring training season!"}
{"text":"Bomb food reminds us of Douglas that is in Whittier, Ca my favorite place. We drive 45 mins for a pastrami, Patti melt and chili fries. And the family atmosphere is great!"}
{"text":"Definitely good burgers. Gyro was eh....

But the haven burger I think is where it's at. Even better than their regular burgers. Awesome flavor."}
{"text":"Please stop by and see Tony. This is a family own and ran business. Tony is welcoming and truly happy to answer any questions you have about menu items. 

We came here for are Friday Family Fun night after opting out of our traditional movie night. I am happy we did. The burgers are made to order on a open flame grill. It's a nice size patty with a delicious sauce. But the star of the show for me was the onion rings here. Tony explained they are made in house! Please send the coins to try them! 
They offer self serve soda machine with plenty of options. Do keep in mind after the 1st refill there is a .50 cent fee. 

Great burger and a fair price. I believe they also serve Mexican food! 

Note parking here can be a little tricky with the light rail on main and it being construction to expand the tracks just a block away!"}
{"text":"I came to try this place out because of the Yelp reviews.. The owner compared it to Cali style burgers.. I'm from Cali.. burger was decent.. zucchini were decent but they are a bit too thick.. I prefer my pastrami cooked a bit more.. we were told it was a longer wait if we wanted breakfast.. we opted for lunch.. I miss George's in Riverside.. I can't find a place like it.. this place is a fair replacement but needs a bit of fine tuning.. #NobodyDoesItLikeCaliDoes"}
{"text":"I had a double cheeseburger you get a good size burger for your money.   It was cooked the day I like it.  As far as flavor it's a burger.  It was good but it is hard to not be good.     I had onion rings with it.  The onion rings were quit taste.    The only have Pepsi cola products which I do not like so I got water.  They had a little trouble pricing out the onion rings because it is usually just an adder to the basket price.  So the Sind then to me at the fries price.  
They were friendly and the food arrived quickly."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a decent burger joint, there are better but you won't be making a bad choice coming here. The atmosphere is of a small food joint and the grill out in the open. The dining area isn't the cleanest, I could see chunks of dust sitting on decor under the  wrap around counter. You do have the open of an outdoor patio but when we went around 12 on Saturday, all of the tables were dirty and neglected. 

Food wise, I ordered the California Burger, as it seems the owner and co were from there and that was a specialty. The burger itself wasn't awful but the store bought patties and bags of commercial buns didn't offer anything to the taste factor. 

The other weird thing is the charge of a refill on your soda after the first one. It's 2017, we all know that restaurants profit on that syrup from the first cup. Seems like bogus thing to charge for but whatever."}
{"text":"Excellent! I was told they were good, but dang, they make some seriously delicious food! I had a cheeseburger & fries. Try out this little joint for good grub any day."}
{"text":"Why are you reading this and not eating all of their onion rings? This place is great and the owner is super friendly. I have never had bad service here."}
{"text":"Had to go on a work trip and was very hungry! Me and my partner stopped at this place because we saw it had decent reviews on here. We were not let down! 

Pros - Great tasting food - friendly customer service - nice diner atmosphere 

Cons - limited parking - one dimensional for the people brought in aka more sports oriented rather than a business style place."}
{"text":"Haven Burgers is a friendly sandwich shop in central Mesa.  I've only been there once, so I'll try to add details about my personal experience.

When I find a new sandwich shop, I always order a Pastrami sandwich.  Doesn't matter if it's hot or cold, just as long as it's Pastrami.  Haven Burgers happened to have a Pastrami and it drew me in.  

Haven Burgers service is rather quick which I was pleased about and the sandwich came out all nice and cut in half (the way I like it).  

I drove home and unwrapped my sandwich and began devouring it.  However, if you know me, I'm not a fan of soggy bread.  Soggy bread is the worst thing ever and this sandwich, while good and tasty with quality Pastrami, had soggy bread.  I'll forgive Haven Burgers for this misfortune by stating I drove home ( a good 10-15 minute drive) therefore giving time for condensation to build up in the wrapping.  However, the soggy bread still deducts 1 star.  I originally would have deducted 2 stars for soggy bread but the cause of it may have been my fault.  

Once the construction on Main is lesser than its current state, I will return to this restaurant and attempt again at finding my Pastrami sandwich.

I'm not sure if I would recommend this place, but we'll say yes because I love local eateries and always try to support good food when I find it."}
{"text":"Really hoping the LDS patron this establishment since it is across from the Mesa Temple. Went to Haven Burger for the first time on July 16, 2013. Took Brandon my son to try it out. I ordered the \"California Burger\", and he had \"The Jalapeno Cheeseburger\". Both of us ordered us combos which all you have to do is spend an extra $2.59 fir fries and a choice of Pepsi products which is a big plus to me! I love \"Char\" burgers, not \"Flame Broiled\" i.e. - Burger King, Carl's Jr.. The day before, I took my other son Trevor to \"The Habit\", a California chain that is now here in the valley due to \"CHAR BURGERS\"!!!! Haven Burger, if they were a chain, would give The Habit, a run for the money! Yes, you can get a \"Double-Char\", for only $2.95, without cheese at the habit, but for the choices here at Haven, they are going to be my choice for wonderful food for along time! PLEASE TAKE MY ADVISE AND TAKE A TRIP TO HAVEN BURGER!!!! - Open six bays a week, and they also have Breakfast which I will write a review about soon, due to I want to try the \"Greek Omelet\" - Also, want to try the  Carne Asada with a Pita! People in Mesa and the east valley - DO NOT MISS OUT ON THIS LITTLE GEM on Main and Hobson. Yes, Light Rail is going on, so might be a pain to get to, BUT WELL WORTH IT!!!! - Review once again by Dan Dugan"}
{"text":"I was very satisfied with the service that I received here. We were greeted warmly upon entering the restaurant. The menu has a variety of options from breakfast to burgers. The drink machine carries Pepsi products and it was a nice change from the regular Coke products. Our meal was brought out in a timely manner and it tasted FANTASTIC. I got the Haven Burger and the flavors were absolutely amazing. I would definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone and everyone!!!"}
{"text":"These burgers are okay at best really small considering they boast about how big their burgers are I probably won't be back here good luck with your future endeavors Haven Burger"}
{"text":"Good food, decent portions!  Will be back next time I am in area."}
{"text":"To be completely honest I didn't care for Haven as much.  The burger itself tasted like a burger that you barbecue on your grille.  The food took a while to get to us."}
{"text":"You know those burgers you can eat while watching TV or talking to the person across the table? Well, this is not that kind of burger...the Haven burger deserves your full attention because it's just that good. They took me seriously when I asked for crispy fries which is refreshing...if you're going to blow your calorie count for the day, this is the place and the burger to blame it on."}
{"text":"BURGER JOINT, located in downtown mesa. 

I ordered there cheese burger special. Unfortunately it's missing that California charbroiled taste to it. Over all the burger was good. The fries were very bland. They serve Pepsi products, which I'm not a fan of. The drinks are very limited and water down. The location is very clean and staff is seemed nice."}
{"text":"I finally had a chance to visit this burger place close to me.
     I'm so glad I did. It is a \"Burger Haven\", with juicy burgers and pretty darn good fries. Not as good as Belgian Fries since they aren't cooked the same but tasty none the less.
     I will be honest and tell you that when I try a new burger place like this I get a simple burger with only mayo and jalapenos. I want to taste the burger patty. Here they make them fresh and add just a little seasoning to 1 side. Easy to see since they make them right in front of you. You can easily monitor their progress if your that concerned about eating at a new place.
     The burger was perfect for my desire. Nice and juicy with lots of flavor. It's nice and big and very satisfying. Add the mayo and jalapenos and I was in Heaven, Oops, I mean Haven.
     There are a bunch of different combos and condiments you can put on them. They normally come with Thousand Island dressing, which is OK, but I like to taste the meat so I go minimal.
     My friends loved theirs. They both finished them off in a heart beat and downed them before I did.
     As we waited I read over the menu and it's was wonderfully varied and enticing. They even have Gyros.
     If your looking for a good burger in the Downtown Mesa area, this place will make you happy."}
{"text":"I found this place through Yelp and I'm glad I did. It's on the small side and it's super busy but service is quick and the food is good. They really have a variety of things to order from breakfast stuff to quesadillas, to burgers and pitas. For me I gotta have the jalapeno burger which is always cooked perfect. It's hard to find a place that doesn't over cook their burger meat."}
{"text":"If your looking for a burger in Mesa, this place will be hard to beat.  Small joint but clean and consistent. Numerous types of burgers, I like the Haven Burger. Burger w pastrami and cheese. Their own sauce is a cross between McDonalds/Jack in the Box type sauce. Fries and onion rings solid. They also have some Mexican food items but have'nt tried. Owner is cheerful, upbeat and cares about service. Give it a shot, Good spot!"}
{"text":"My buddy wanted to try this restaurant because they had good reviews and the photos of the burgers looked amazing.

I went there last night at 8:30 to the place being closed, while every website shows that they're open to 9. Oddly enough, their own website takes you to some diet website....

There was a small parentheses that the hours were subject to change at any given time. It would be nice if they had a functional website that said so before I drove 15 miles to find out I wasn't getting a burger. It's too bad that you have to call to RSVP your burger but pro tip: If you're going past 8, call in advance to see if they're open because you'll never know what you get if you just show up"}
{"text":"Met up here with a friend.  We said \"Hey, go Yelp a place to eat around here!\" and he pointed this place out.  Im all for trying new places and this place was great.  Love the small mom & pop shops!"}
{"text":"Blah, nothing impressive. I got a burger combo. I won't be going back."}
{"text":"This is a great little burger joint! The food is really really good, I fancy the jalepeno burger but I have tried the Haven Burger and you cant go wrong there either. The atmosphere is fun and the owner is always helpful and friendly, he takes the time to chat here at there too. The food it very fresh tasting, I would definitely recommend the onion rings, and their zucchini fries. I have yet to try one of their burritos or something off their breakfast menu, I hope to do that soon!"}
{"text":"Had the hamburger combo and was very very pleased and satisfied. It was just like having a homemade burger. Something about this place makes you want to come back sooner than later. It is small and comfy and super clean.  So glad we gave it a try on our visit to Mesa."}
{"text":"Well we'd loved to have been able to given them a great review as others have but when we arrived mid-afternoon they were closed despite supposedly being open until 9pm.  Sorely disappointing."}
{"text":"We had stopped by here before heading out to the bars. The food was delicious. My boyfriend got the carne asada quesadilla and I got the California burger. Both were really good, did not disappoint at all. They have a good menu selection with Mexican and American food. They even have a breakfast menu. The service was quick and the guy taking our order was patient while we kept trying to decide what to get and questioning him about different selections. Can't wait to go again!"}
{"text":"I LOVE Haven Burger! It's very close to my home and office and I always have an amazing experience! Few restaurants offer this amount of \"bang for the buck\"... For a few bucks *less* than what it costs to eat a combo meal at Jack in The Box or McDonald's you're in for a legit, beefy, burger with a flavor explosion factor not available at places with drive-thru windows.
Add that to a really friendly staff, cheery environment, and a unique, varied menu of american burger favorites, and awesome Mexican comfort foods, and you just can't go wrong!
I suggest a double pastrami burger with cheese. *drools*"}
{"text":"Haven Burgers is a small burger joint on Hobson and Main, kitty-corner to the Mesa Mormon Temple and across from Pioneer Park. The menu is very creative and they serve everything from innovative breakfast fare to delicious takes on classic Americana. They also have really good Hispanic food with fun additions or toppings that you won't find anywhere else.
Their specialty here is the Haven Burger, pretty much a large, well made cheeseburger with warm, spicy pastrami on top. It is sooo good, I get these all the time. The list of burgers on their menu is extensive, and they really try to get the tastiest combos of toppings on every sandwich. They also have funny quirks on their menu like the pastrami quesadilla, but it actually turned out being delicious.
I've ordered most of their menu, and not once have I been less than pleased with everything I've gotten. Even the sides are delicious, and the onion rings are fresh-made and probably some of the very best in Old-Town Mesa. I've introduced my family and many of my friends to this unassuming restaurant, and everyone who goes loves it. My brother actually holds the owner's record for eating the most food from their restaurant. :)
If you like great Southwestern food with fresh ingredients and a vibrant, rare twist on every dish, Haven Burgers is the place to be."}
{"text":"Haven Burger has delicious burgers, fries and fried zucchini in a very relaxed atmosphere. I stop here every time I am in Mesa."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place!!! In town working at a clients and decided to stop in given the great reviews. I assume it was the owner that took my order (or an employee that really loves his job). He was extra friendly and made me feel like I had made the right choice after working long hours. I ordered the jalapeño burger combo and it did not disappoint! Delicious charbroiled flavor and the fries were amazing!!! The soda even tasted better than most I swear. Took me back to the little burger joint I worked at in high school. I only wish there were one back in Vegas! I will definitely be coming in every time I'm in town."}
{"text":"Excellent burger joint! Everything taste great and service was friendly  and efficient. Had the Haven burger with Pastrami and chili cheese frys. We tried onion rings as well. Everything was good. I will go back, interested in trying their breakfast items! I will update after I do."}
{"text":"Haven Burgers is very clean. Burgers are REALLY good. Service is friendly and fast. Prices are low. This place is family owned and you can tell they are passionate about and proud of their food. 

I'm probably going to have to come back to try other things on the menu. They also have breakfast including breakfast burritos, French toast, and cook to order omelets. They also have Mexican style burritos and quesadillas, and a variety of salads. The burger was excellent though, so as I sit here in the booth digesting and writing this, I'm already thinking about the next one I'm gonna order when I return."}
{"text":"I thought this place was okay, but not great.  I ordered a double cheeseburger with pickles only on it and fries and drink.  They serve their burgers with Thousand Island dressing but I'm not into that.  The burger is served on a big sesame seed bun.  The fries were about average.  The restaurant is sort of a hole-in-the-wall establishment but I recommend other burger places such as The Chuckbox in Tempe."}
{"text":"Parking was terrible, but the food was great! I got a cheese burger and my husband had the haven burger and fries. Both were cooked to perfection and everything was fresh and delicious! We will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Thanks Tony and crew for super service, fine fare, and genial conversation.  Our party visited yesterday evening after a grandchild's winter concert on recommendation by his mom.  Normally an easy commute down Main Street in Mesa, be advised that at the time of this posting, the Light Rail expansion development may pose temporary logistical challenges.  Haven Burgers' brightly lit storefront anchors a smallish strip mall northeast of Dairy Queen, The Mormon Temple, and Pioneer Park, on alternate corners.  A welcoming family atmosphere, and perceived culture that engages catering to folks occupying various stations in life.
We proceeded to be intrigued by a variety of offerings displayed on overhead menus.  Apparently a signature selection item, Pastrami was ordered in a wrap, while an enhanced burger was selected as well.  A grilled chicken quesadilla, as well as multiple sides filled the bill.  Support ingredients (reportedly locally sourced as possible) along with watchful preparation enabled us to acknowledge freshness, juicy, tender, well-seasoned, arrangements that met our approval.  A couple of sides were relatively less satisfying than the main players.  Although serviceable, Onion Rings and Zucchini could benefit from non-standard breading.
We did miss out on a known Havens Burgers favorite incorporating Gyro meat; the day's prepared quantity being exhausted before we arrived.  I consider that a good sign, and I'm looking forward to trying it on a future visit.  There were raves from some repeat visit diners all too willing to attest to the popularity of said selection.  Opa!"}
{"text":"I reminesce on the times I've had these burgers and fries. Ugh, so delicious. Just waiting to go back!! Shout out to the friendly staff and amazing chef"}
{"text":"We ended up at this place a couple of weeks back because my fiance was craving a good burger from someplace we had not tried before.  I saw the great reviews on Yelp and loved the idea of trying a popular local burger shop instead of a larger chain.

Unfortunately this was not the experience that we'd hoped for.  My fiance's burger was overlu-salted and rarer than he ordered.  The fries were pretty generic like Ore-Idas.

I ordered the chicken gyro and was even more disappointed.  The meat was over-cooked and not seasoned well, dry meat but a sloppy amount of sauce.  Very dull taste and I would not recommend this to anybody.

The manager was nice, though.  He asked about our meal and offered to make another burger to make up for it, but we declined.  That seemed like their normal recipe and I am not sure why the second one would be tastier than the first.  And if you are looking for a gyro, go a few blocks north and head to George's Gryros instead."}
{"text":"A great find across the street from LDS Temple. Great patty melt and fries. Noticed a lot of people ordering the fried zucchini, so will try that next time. Very reasonable prices, too."}
{"text":"Butgers are ok. Rude staff. Last time I came here they were closed before actual closing time."}
{"text":"Checked out The Haven for the first time when in town for a show. Nice little burger shop. No frills, nothing fancy, but a nicely made burger just as I ordered it. KT had the chicken burrito and loved it, finishing every bite. Good fries as well, and I'm particular. Just like the California roadsides you see so many of. Not my favorite spot, but would definitely return."}
{"text":"Decent burger, thin patty, fries not worth the price. Kinda pricey considering what you get. I might come back and try the pastrami. The older lady that took my order wasn't the friendliest. Overall Grade C."}
{"text":"This reminds me of a burger place i use to go to called Tams in los angeles. Since moving here i haven't been able to find a good burger place. And the owner treats me like family since I'm a regular. I come here at least 3 times a month."}
{"text":"I finally have a new favorite local burger place. A little piece of East L.A. county in East Valley, Arizona, which is a very welcome rarity. Great burgers, great pastrami, generous spears of fried zucchini, and I can't wait to try one of their gyros."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. There aren't many private owned hamburger stands in metro Phoenix. Haven Burgers is the only real burger place that I know of in Mesa. The owners of this place are California natives and very friendly. Service is prompt and the menu is good. The food though!  The hamburgers are top notch! Try them all. You won't be disappointed. The pastrami sandwich is the best no kidding. I highly recommend this place to anyone who loves hamburgers. It's definitely worth the drive...."}
{"text":"Damn good burger spot! Located in the heart of downtown Mesa, Haven Burgers is a place you must check out in the valley. The location is hidden right across the street from a church, but once you find it, it will be well worth your time. The restaurant is very small, but they offer outdoor seating that is perfect for outside eating on a warm day. The owner will greet you himself at the door and follows up with you through out your dining experience to make sure you are fully satisfied and comfortable. I ordered a double burger with bacon and it far exceed my expectations. This is definitely a place you have to visit more than once if you are in the downtown Mesa/ East Valley area! Would recommend for lunch or dinner anytime of day!"}
{"text":"Having lived in CA for 30 years & recently moving here, I had no idea that a pastrami with mustard & pickles on a roll served at the Hat or Johnny's was \"california\" style. But I was familiar with the CA style suburban burger diner with a large menu of burgers, fries, breakfast, & misc. fried options. 

So I gave Haven Burgers a try. The pastrami was just the style i was looking for, a little small, and light on the mustard, and bun was kinda dry, but I do love the effort that was put forth. It's my favorite pastrami in the area even though it falls short of the Hat or Johnny's. 
The charbroiled burger was definitely good. Haven does a good job of providing comfort food at a fair price. 

The place has a family ran vibe, they're friendly, and I'll be back to support them as I hope they continue to find success."}
{"text":"We have found the burger joint we have been looking for since leaving So Cal.  Wonderful char broiled  burgers, delicious fries and some of the best fried zucchini I've had in years.  This restaurant is clean and comfortable. The staff is super nice and friendly. It's really great to have an awesome burger for a decent price. Cant wait to try other menu items like Pastrami, the Chili,  A Burrito, and  breakfast. Looking forward to it!"}
{"text":"My wife and I ate here after getting done with our window cleaning job in the area.  My wife ordered the BLT, which was put together well.  Some burger joints just slap everything together, hand you your item and say good luck.  Not this place, they take the time to make sure everything is laid out perfect.  My first time being here, I just went with the Haven burger.  It was amazing!!!  They cut it in half so it was easy to eat and everything was cooked perfect.  The fries were big, not the skinny crap found at other places.  I would go back to this place again to try their rib eye steak sandwich.  The interior is nothing to write home about, but the food makes up for it.  Next time you are in mesa, give this place a try!"}
{"text":"Great burger! I thought pastrami was weird on a burger but it was great. Really recommend"}
{"text":"Just became one of our favorite places!!! Although we can't go all the time (I'll never lose any weight, portions here are huge!!) It was a great experience!! The owner was out speaking to regulars by first name and giving first timers a clear understanding of the kind of business they are! His wife is in the back preparing orders and making sure things are running smoothly!! 

Did I mention the food was perfect!! I had a lettuce wrapped Haven burger (regular burger topped with pastrami) in which I couldn't finish because I was helping myself to my bfffffs steak quesadilla!! Which were absolutely fabulous. 

Every meat we had was perfectly complimented with seasoning, and tasted like it was made to!!!

Great space! Please Indulge!"}

{"text":"Best breakfast burrito place EVER! This is my go to place even though it's about 15 minutes away from my house I wouldn't go anywhere else if I'm craving a breakfast burrito. The tortillas taste fresh and they're always packed to the brink of bursting with the yummy fillings (my favorite is the bacon). Although this place isn't 5 star looking, it is 5 star tasting and very consistent."}
{"text":"This is the spot! A mom and pop shop in the down town Mesa area. Haven burger and Lenny's are the 2 best burger spots in Mesa. Although they are different. Haven burger is also less expensive. It is actually very affordable and you get your money's worth. It is a must eat spot."}
{"text":"Not only does Haven Burgers have incredible burgers, my favorite is the patty melt, their customer service is phenomenal!  
Yesterday my husband burned his hand badly when a radiator blew on his hand. He spent the morning with his hand in ice water but it was still very red and starting to blister. We took a lunch break and went to Haven Burgers, his hand still wrapped in a cold wet cloth to try and ease the pain. 
While we were eating the owner came over to ask what happened to his hand. My husband told him. Without hesitation, the owner removed his apron and told us to hang on a couple of minutes. He actually went to his home and cut off a piece of an aloe vera plant that he had. He brought it back and showed us how to apply the gel to the burn. I offered to pay him for his trouble and he wouldn't accept any payment. 
The aloe was a total success and blistering has stopped. The pain is greatly improved and even the redness has improved. All because of the kindness of this wonderful man, the owner of Haven Burgers. 
He has customers for life!  We greatly appreciate his concern and unselfish act. 
Thank you, thank you so much!"}
{"text":"This place reminds me of pastramis back home in L.A. It was absolutely delicious!!! They also have Tommys Burger style!! And they serve breakfast!! Wth!! I'm definitely returning!! Also , a shout out whom I'm thinking is the main man, very nice and personable !!! YES this gets 5 plus stars!! Thank you so much for bringing a little L.A. To Mesa!!!"}
{"text":"Filling portions, decent prices, Gyros meat was a little over cooked, burgers are like a sweet Burger King burger. I'd go back. But wouldn't go out of my way to eat here."}
{"text":"Good burger.  Pastrami adds a nice secondary taste.

Fries were ok...not special.  Also had the fried zucchini.  It was good but it appeared to be cut in lengthwise quarters.  It would probably be better if it was sliced.  Moreover if they sliced it they could most likely get away serving less zucchini (we had almost as much leftover as we ate).

Overall real good."}
{"text":"Haven Burger, wow. Needed a burger joint in this area today and this had good reviews here and on Google. We went and wow. The Haven Burger has pastrami and 1000 Islands dressing, and it was so awesome. The owner was totally rad, too. I know it costs lots for the license but a beer would've topped it off very nicely!"}
{"text":"Burger Haven has great food and the owner is always pleasant and excited about his business and pleasing customers. I've been here 4 maybe 5 times and I'm always happy I came."}
