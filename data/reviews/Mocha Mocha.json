{"text":"Guys you gotta check out this little cafe. Especially for their Sunday Brunch. Friendly staff, well balanced healthy food, cozy environment and good coffee. Love their pasta there. Better than eggspectation or Cora."}
{"text":"My mom (who doesn't live in the neighbourhood) took me here for lunch yesterday because it's her favourite. It was very cute and the menu has great options at a very reasonable price. I had the Salad Nicoise and it was excellent! I saw some people eating delicious looking sandwiches as well. All in all, this place is a gem in the neighbourhood and I was super impressed!"}
{"text":"I quite enjoy Mocha Mocha. 
Very casual - healthy - tasty food. 
Clean place, friendly staff, quite a variety of meals that are certainly not your normal 'American / Canadian' lunch. It gets busy at lunch.
You pay a reasonable price for quality and freshness.
The hardest part is finding parking on the Danforth."}
{"text":"The gazpacho  was amazing. Freshly made with just the right amount of spice. The chicken enchiladas were delicious with the jalapeños placed so it was your option to have them.  The vegetable lasagna was quite nice. The salads were well put together with a lovely balsamic vinaigrette and a nice mix of vegetables. 

The portions are very generous and the service is pleasant and prompt. 

Atmosphere is simple and relaxed. The air conditioning was a little light but then again it was 28° outside plus humidex. 

Parking is the only thing that is a downside but you expect that in this are of the Danforth."}
{"text":"Love this place! The prices are reasonable, the service is decent, they deliver (extra bonus), and most importantly the food is delicious. I am a big fan of the chicken enchiladas, bean burrito platter, BLT avocado, and the avocado salad plate. They also have good soups and a variety of tasty treats. It can get crowded, but that doesn't bother me much. Mocha Mocha is definitely one of my favourite spots in the area."}
{"text":"Mocha Mocha is my #1 go-to neighborhood lunch and brunch place. The food is extremely fresh, unique and very tasty. The menu is varied enough to have something for everyone and the vibe is comfortable and casual. Prices are very reasonable, especially given the freshness of the ingredients.
My general beefs with the place are the over-cluttered dining room- too many tables to maneuver the place when it's full and the less-than-efficient service. It's cafeteria-style ordering protocol is fine when the place isn't busy but when it's packed, you are likely to get long waits, incorrect order delivery and confused wait-staff. 
My fave orders are the Spicy Hummus Pita, Quesadillas, Avocado BLT and Brown Rice Salad. Also yummy- the carrot muffins and macaroons.
It's conveniently located in the heart of the Danforth just East of the Chester TTC station and is very kid-friendly."}
{"text":"The nicoise salad was made with tuna salad, not seared tuna, but that was okay because I knew from their website beforehand. It was fresh and tasty. But the lettuce leaves were whole--can't eat that without cutting them. And there was only ONE olive. ONE. Felt stingy.

My friend had the chicken enchilada and I had a taste. Seemed like pasta sauce on it instead of salsa. Meh.

The bathroom is awkward to get to and the servers seemed put out to let me through to reach it. Did not feel welcome."}
{"text":"I got food poisoning there. I believe it was an old egg in the salad or something else. When I called them - twice - they were unpleasant and dismissive. didn't even asked how I was feeling. Not going back. I have been going there for many years it is not as good as it used to be. Too bad......"}
{"text":"Before visiting, I heard quite a few positive reviews about this place, so I figured it would be stellar. It wasn't.

The first thing that ticked me off about this place is the ordering process. You approach the counter and place your order. Not a problem, lots of places operate that way.

What bothered me was having to stand there for several minutes - while some servers buzzed around the half-empty restaurant and two stood in the kitchen area yapping - before someone finally took my order. None of the employees seemed to be happy to be there that day.

The food came out quickly (it's brought to the table), but I wasn't happy with what I ordered - a BLT avocado. The toast was rock hard and messed up the top of my mouth, and it falls behind many other restaurant BLTs I've eaten in the past.

Hold onto the receipt the server gives you because you'll need it when you go back up to the counter to pay."}
{"text":"Finally, I got to try Mocha Mocha. What a pleasant surprise on the souvlaki Danforth. I got everything to go as we were making a picnic out of the first great weather day. The vegetarian club is stuffed and the chewy toasted bread is delicious. There were huge pieces of a brocoli, potato and onion bake in a homemade crust. Incredible texture especially since it was not soggy from the brocoli. The chicken quesadilla was cheesy and could have used a few more chicken pieces, but it was still better than other places. The penne pasta of the day was ok, whole wheat pasta would have been healthier. Finally, the veggies stuffed hummous wrap was fresh and tasty. I was happily surprised at the very reasonable prices considering that some of the dishes included a freshly made salad, and a generous amount. I found the service excellent and I did not mind waiting the 10 minutes for my order as it was all prepared fresh. I counted no fewer than 8 ladies behind the counter and they all looked happy, no sourpuss faces. They all seemed to get along and be in tune with each other while preparing the food. One lady patiently took my order and did not rush me. The same lady packed my order and handed it to me and asked if I needed napkins and forks, to which I said yes. She quickly bagged those items and smilingly handed them to me. I should also say that I had two vouchers that I bid and purchased for this order. There was no questions asked, no negative looks, and I was treated like any other customer. The place was constantly busy with people walking in and out. I will definately return as the food was healthly, fresh and awesome tasting."}
{"text":"Loved this little brunch spot on a lazy Sunday. Mocha Mocha was still really packed even though I came in around 2pm. I have to admit I was a little confused by the cafeteria style ordering, but still enjoyed my visit nonetheless. I gleefully ate up my scrambled eggs and lox with organic wheat toast. Although there wasn't an empty seat in the place I still found it easy to carry on a conversation without feeling like I was shouting across the table. I can't wait to come back again."}
{"text":"Cafeteria meets salad bar, it's a nice little restaurant located in Greektown.

I was told the chicken quesadillas are a favourite.

They were indeed delicious and surprisingly filling.
A good portion, usually I expect to be starving after quesadillas.
The fresh salad with giant avocado chunks was tasty.
And, you can get your own free water from the cooler.
Excellent.

The sandwiches were okay from what I saw... I'm glad I ordered what I did.

I might eat here again if I happen to be in Greektown and I want quesadillas...you know instead of souvlaki...well, I guess you can find everything on the Danforth... 

So, if I don't want souvlaki, sushi, or pub fare...I might end up here...
but I can see why it's a local favourite if you want a nice healthy meal."}
{"text":"The best BLT I've ever had, and the nicoise salad is amazing too. Their salad dressing is soooooo good."}
{"text":"I give two stars for good food and consistency. It does bother me that from time to time they do get a warning from the health department. One should really pay attention to those little green signs in the window; mandatory and provided by the city of Toronto warnings of health issues. 

It can be slow for service, but the wait is usually satisfying and worth it.  I've been a regular here since a date brought me here more then 15 years ago. He is long gone, but Mocha Mocha is still here. 

I have several favorite dishes including the vegetarian lasagna, tuna cake, and the vegetarian club. This is not strictly a vegetarian place, but has a good selection on both sides. You would once see me here at least once a week. 

Now because of the constant warnings for minor infractions from the health department, I limit my going. I'm surprised to see they have had several infractions on the city department website.

Update: Been again recently and noticed the health warning posted again in the window. What are you people doing here? Your health warnings are a risk of making people sick, you got good food, clean up your act please.

March 2014: After 15+years of consistently good food they are finally starting to slip.  The last two times if it had been my first time I wouldn't go back. The lasagna tasted like it was microwaved in a plastic dish and you could taste the plastic in the food.  Not good. If I go a third time and it is bad food and bad service, I won't go back and they will have lost a loyal customer of 15 years.

April 2014: I've taken away another star because they are no longer consistent. Is it just me or is this place going down hill fast.

May 2014: Again, this place seems to be going down hill fast.. I wanted to order the lasagna but the last time it tasted so bad I couldn't finish it. They had one piece left over and it looked bad. Should not have been offering it. They use to have a very high standard here. Am I the only one noticing the decline...   I keep coming back because it was once so good."}
{"text":"Mocha Mocha is always packed and it's definitely a popular spot on the Danforth...but I'm just not a fan. I've been twice--once for brunch and once for lunch and I really wasn't that impressed.

For such a small place the menu looks huge, but there's really not much variety; pretty much everything savory comes with cheese and avocado. It's healthy in the sense that it's not deep-fried and everything is fresh but i don't think you'd really find anything low-fat / low-cal. The coffee wasn't anything special either.

BUT that's not to say it's all bad. Despite the fact it was packed both times I went there the service was still good-- they were quick to bring our meals, they got our orders right and they were friendly. The cafeteria-style makes for a comfortable, cozy atmosphere. And the food was alright...just not exactly what I wanted. 

I wouldn't plan to go there again, but if I was going out with people who really wanted to eat there I wouldn't make a fuss."}
{"text":"This our go-to place for breakfast. Great food, friendly staff, cozy atmosphere -- have been going here for years.

Lots of regulars here but you need to know that you order (and pay) at the counter and serve yourself coffee -- the atmosphere is very relaxed! Always amusing to see the occasional \"Withrow Park princess\" flounce about clucking their tongue and muttering that no one is serving them.

Menu is imaginative and electic with some good traditional choices as well."}
{"text":"This place is our favorite place for breakfast or lunch on the Danforth. Food is fresh, meals healthy. Nicoise salad, fiesta platter, fish tacos, potato tuna cake, grilled veggie sandwich with avocado...oh the daily soup.....all amazing. Highly recommend it."}
{"text":"when you walk into this place, you immediately feel the love for food, for people and for honest value.   It's awesome. 

If you are looking for reasonably healthy fair on this stretch of the danforth, you can't beat this place.  I like the casual cafeteria like arrangement and the fact that I can always help myself to a newspaper, water, etc.  In the winter, it's a great place to stop for a bowl of coffee or hot chocolate."}
{"text":"Sooo I'm a regular here.
The food is consistently amazing- especially the vegetarian club, and brown rice salad. Their salad dressing is the shizz (and you can even buy it bottled!!). So is their yummy tomato sauce. 
Mocha Mocha, please expand your cafe. There are always crowds. I've seen many customers come in, and then decide to leave- just because of the sheer volume of people. Maybe open a second location? ahem.. in Leslieville...I know it would make a lot of us very happy."}
{"text":"Acceptable place to get breakfast on a Saturday. As other reviewers have mentioned the service and ordering system is chaotic. I was brought multiple incorrect orders before finally getting my proper order. I also watched them passed the soy latte around to everyone in the shop. Also, whatever they put in their lattes, not sure how many shots, but I seriously think they put three because I was jittery all day. I thought that was excessive. The omelette was nice enough and the toast was especially good, but the one cash register girl turned server tried to tell us that we got one plate of 2 pieces of toast to share for two orders. We asked because the sign says two pieces. Anyways she told us twice after giving us quizzical looks that the plate was to share. Then the only knowledgeable girl in the whole place stepped up and was like you are wrong. Go get them another toast!

So service is spotty."}
{"text":"Okay GTA people. We've found our new favourite restaurant. Mocha Mocha on the Danforth. Heirloom lettuce, fresh tomatoes and crispy multigrain bread. Their fruit bowl is pineapple, blueberries, honeydew melon, strawberries, and bananas. Their bacon is not those microwaved salt sticks, but real bacon, made to order. The orange juice is fresh-squeezed and not watered down. Not a fan of the eggs; I saw an omelette that had some tan parts. The staff is wonderful: clean, great social skills, more than accommodating! They are helpful without being intrusive. They are at Danforth and Logan but a limited menu is available through UberEats"}
{"text":"This place has been mentioned to my Husband and I a number of times. We've been living in the Danforth neighbourhood for about a year and a half now and finally chanced Mocha Mocha this past Saturday for brunch. 

It's an interesting cafeteria meets salad bar type place. Lots of fresh salads, breakfast plates, etc. No frills when it comes to coffee beverages (despite it's namesake) and other beverage selections. 

The menu is pretty extensive for such a small place but there are many steps involved in getting your food. 

First, you seat yourself. Most of the few available tables are dirty. You can either handle that or you can't. If you work across the street from the Eaton Centre and occassionally have lunch there, you know of what I speak. Anyhow, you order at one counter, receive your food and your bill shortly thereafter and pay at another counter once you're done. 

It's an interesting and, dare I say, antiquated system. But, it seems to work for Mocha, Mocha, judging by the sheer volume of people. I also overhead people saying things like \"the regular\", so I assume people go there a lot. The Danforth has a number of brunch places which I haven't tried, though I am big on brunch. 

Bottom line- if you want a reasonably priced, packed full of fresh ingredients meal, give Mocha Mocha a try."}
{"text":"I love coming here for breakfast or brunch! The food is always great and feels much healthier than greasy eggs/bacon/toast (e.g., omlettes, crepes, burritos). It's very clean, but a bit crowded. The coffee is always fair trade but you have to pay by the cup."}
{"text":"my take out food was delicious.  you can never go wrong with the ham and cheese avacado crepe.  its the best I've ever had.  Im a frequent here, I've had the avacado salad, the nicoise salad, as well as a few of the sandwiches incl the vegetarian club, ALL FREAKING incredible.

staff is friendly as well."}
{"text":"I really want to like Mocha Mocha - but this is the second time I've left extremely underwhelmed. 

Last time I visited I had one simple request - syrup for my crepes. But alas they had no syrup at all!? They actually looked at me like I was some sort of scaly leper for wanting such a crazy thing such as syrup!

So this time I decided to circumvent the syrup fiasco and just go for scrambled eggs and bacon. Now, after my excellent experience at Motorama I guess my expectations were higher for Mocha Mocha - and all they did was disappoint.

They said they were out of green tea. WHO GOES OUT OF GREEN TEA? Seriously. Its not like they have to ship it in from China - I know they're giving me Lipton. What? No one make a run to Loblaws on the weekend? And then I made the mistake of wanting ketchup for my eggs. I asked for it, but the girl left and never came back...so I had to make my way to the counter (with my kid strapped to the front in the carrier) to get my tiny serving of ketchup. And by the time I actually got to eat...pretty much everything was cold.

So sufficed to say this place is also not kid friendly. I'm glad that my friend and I had our son's in carriers because god forbid we take strollers in there! Also for some reason this old lady in leopard rain boots kept giving us the \"huff face\" whenever our kids started to fuss. I think we were really ruining her snobby goat cheese salad experience. 

So yea, the salad's looked pretty good, but the breakfasts for $8 wasn't worth it in my opinion. I don't think after two meh experiences I'll be coming back."}
{"text":"We go to Mocha Mocha so often that my husband and I joke about how it's our cafeteria. The food is always fresh and well prepared. Our favorites are: Fiesta platter, salad nicoise, and African chicken stew."}
{"text":"The salads are exceptionally fresh and tasty. I usually enjoy the Nicoise when I am there. The prices are very reasonable."}
{"text":"Not the best place to go for a sit-down meal...  I'm not a fan of ordering at the counter, waiting at my table, and then paying at the counter. That being said,  I LOVE the food there! And as far as I'm concerned, they have the BEST veggie sandwich in the city (try their veggie club)!!!"}
{"text":"I have three words for you: tuna potato cake. Believe me, it's a lot more appetizing than it sounds. Mocha Mocha offers this dish up on Tuesdays and Fridays only, and I was fortunate enough to have my first dinner here on a Tuesday. I was a little overwhelmed by the menu, and I saw someone in front of me at the counter order the tuna potato cake, so I thought, \"Why not?\" and I haven't looked back since.

Imagine a really thick, cake-like latke that's just the right amount of spicy with chunks of vegetables and a hint of tuna mixed in. The tuna perfectly compliments the middle eastern flavour of the spices. The cake is served with a side salad - the cake is so large, though, that I ate half with dinner and wrapped up the other half to bring home.

Mocha Mocha also serves soups, sandwiches, pasta, breakfast food, pastries and a variety of the other dishes. Almost all the main dishes are served with a generous portion of garden salad on the side. It's a breath of fresh air between all the greasy fries options in the city, if you're like me (a.k.a. lazy when it comes to cooking and fairly reliant on eating out). I don't think they even have french fries on the menu, and I love that. I can also vouch for their delicious beef empanadas, though I once ordered a banana smoothie that was fairly lackluster. 

Mocha Mocha is quickly becoming a favourite Danforth haunt of mine for their fresh, flavourful menu and laid-back, cafeteria-style dining room."}
{"text":"I've been going here for years, and it's always been tasty, healthy, good-value cuisine. Their fiesta platter is like heaven to me. I also like that it's casual, something between table service and self-service (order at the counter) so it's no fuss. The women who work there are great."}
{"text":"It's not quite a cafe and not quite a diner - whatever it is, it's wonder. 

I wish I could say I've tried a lot of the food here, but I haven't. Every time I go I think about ordering something different than my \"usual\" but it's just so good that I can't not get it. So what is this \"usual\" dish, you ask! The veggie club. 

So why is this veggie club so good? It's a veggie sandwich, grilled cheese hybrid with avocado, eggplant, tomatoes, mozzarella, it's fantastic. It also comes with a side salad that's pretty good too. There are very few dishes I find myself craving but for some reason this sandwich is one of them. I would have to say it's probably one of my favourite go-to sandwiches in the city. 

Maybe one of these days I'll try something else but probably not."}
{"text":"After reading and hearing how good this place was, I decided to try some take out. While I must say the food was amazing - fresh, healthy and very delicious, the service on the other hand was dreadful. This place needs to take a long hard look at how it is set up and also the staff needs to have some hard core training sessions in a little thing called customer service. I should not have to stand there, having staff behind the counter, making eye contact and yet ignoring me, while I meanwhile had to dodge the one waitress as she carried plates to customers eating in. And when it FINALLY came time that I was served, the woman's English was so poor, I could not understand her and had to ask her about four times to repeat what she said. There was a group of about four also first time women that went before me and I heard them make the same comment, that they couldn't understand her. I am NOT knocking someone who has not mastered English but why put this person on ordering duty? But that wasn't my major complaint. That was having to stand there, for five minutes and be ignored. 

The food? The food was delicious but was it worth the wait? I'm thinking no. The Danforth is full of places to eat so thankfully there's no shortage. Places where instead of standing there waiting, being ignored, you can be in and out and on your way in the time you'd still be waiting in Mocha Mocha. 

I gave two stars for the food. Had the review strictly been on service alone, I would have scored it zero."}
{"text":"Really huge portions, great flavours and good value. It's a self service restaurant so if you sit on the patio you have to order at the counter and then sit down. Really enjoyable food."}
{"text":"Come here for a healthy breakfast. There seems to be a little Mexican and Japanese fusion in their dishes, and I like it."}
{"text":"The winter of exceptional late brunches continues!

It's cafeteria style.   It LOOKS healthy.  It FEELS healthy.

It's foooking delicious!

A wonderful assortment of unique dishes, many of which feature avocados and eggplant.     Just mind-numbingly good food.

It's like an unpretentious version of the restaurant \"fresh\".  

The decor is plain-jane.  The coffee is forgettable.   But it's one of the better places for brunch in town."}
{"text":"Great location for a fresh, healthy meal.

I had the spicy chickpea guacamole pita and it was delicious! I kept a keen eye on what others were receiving and everything else looked really good - especially the fiesta platter. The sweet things looked great too!"}
{"text":"Slowest takeout ever! Waited for spaghetti and the other food got cold in the meantime. Never coming back again."}
{"text":"Walking around Danforth and found this gem. I ordered the tuna melt and my boyfriend got the burrito platter. We both loved the food very yummy. Clean fast and best everything looked and tasted fresh! :)"}
{"text":"VIBE 
Mocha Mocha is one of my regular Danforth spots. Unpretentious and always packed with regulars (mainly girlfriends or families) it's great for lunch or an afternoon. If I'm having a bad day, their meals always cheer me up. It reminds me of a little Parisian cafe. 

It's small so a bit tightly packed and if there are strollers, it's another challenge to navigate. But if you're near the window and on the patio the view can't be beat! Love it! 

A word about ordering: go up to the counter; order. Keep your tiny receipt (or chaos ensues). Then the staff will bring the meal to your table. You can get water from the gatorade jug on the side counter. Service isn't the greatest but it's not awful. More meh. 

I EAT/ATE 
Everything here is made fresh on the premises and you can taste it. I love their chicken enchilada which comes with rice and a heaping portion of salad. Their warm potato salad with feta is one of my cravings (just ask for extra olives...they always skimp on them. Four olives is pushing it for them) and their cookies are quite delish too. Of course, the food here is kind of fusion leaning on French/African so the crepes are quite delish.  Their brunch isn't anything special but if you're looking for a cute place on a Sunday, it's nice for a catch up (beware waits).  Food is king here for healthy/hearty. Good value. 

OBLIGATORY CATCHY REMARK 
Yummy Mommies and fans of chick lit will love it here. It's adult cafeteria basically. Great food. Me Likey."}
{"text":"This place has always been a reliable source for a good meal for me and my family for about ten years. 

The ambience is great (if you are into that stuff), they usually have good, appropriate music playing, and the lights are just dimmed enough. 

Different ordering system: You pick your table, put everything down, go up to the counter and order. They bring you your food, with a chit saying what you've ordered. This doesn't exactly seem efficient to me, as I've often gone up to order dessert and they write you out another chit so you now have two bills instead of one. Not very environmentally friendly I'd say. 

BUT. This place is a constant. 

Favorite dish: Bean Burrito. Comes with a salad and rice. Mmm. So good.

The servings are HUGE. Esp. this dish. If you have a small appetite, definitely splitable. 

Lack of fifth star: A few time the service has been iffy. I could swear that the entire staff was high."}
{"text":"Great food but consistently lacklustre and slow service.  If they could actually get their act together, they would be much better and have a more loyal following than they already do."}
{"text":"I was pretty disappointed by my meal there, which is the main reason for giving Mocha Mocha only 2 stars. I met a friend for lunch there and checked out their online menu the night before. Everything looked really yummy, healthy, and satisfying...I was sure I couldn't go wrong.

But I did! I ordered the Vegetable Mozzarella crepe which came wet (not just soggy) and strangely sweet as if they had mistaken the sugar for salt. The vegetables were fresh, which was nice, but all of the juices that had seeped out during cooking were dumped on top of the delicate crepe and rendered it pointless and pretty unpleasant. On top of it all, there was SO MUCH CHEESE, which I normally wouldn't be opposed to, but it just felt far too heavy to be on this dish; on this crepe which I normally attribute to light and lovely. My chai latte was nice and foamy, but absolutely mediocre. 

My friend had a light lunch of soup and an Americano. The soup looked rich and delicious and other diners' meals looked pretty great too. I might give it another chance and get the fish tacos once I get over that weird sweet and boggy crepe...

Didn't mind that I had to order at the counter, the food was the main problem."}
{"text":"To make it brief, like others said... their \"ordering system\" is a little different compared to most places. At least for me - it felt pretty new. You had to go up to the counter to order, and they would give you a receipt to hold on to (you'll hand this back to them when you pay for your order AFTER you eat), and they'll tell you to take a seat and bring the food to you.

So okay. A little confusing... my friends and I needed some direction, but it was easy to get used to after a while.

Oh, and a warning to anyone who decides to bring food from outside into the restaurant: the ladies behind the counter can get a little picky about that. A friend wasn't allowed to eat the food she brought in even though the rest of us were ordering and were paying customers. So while we all chowed down on the food, the lady behind the counter was eyeing down my friend to make sure she wasn't drinking her pop.

I felt the reaction was kind of excessive to be honest... but the food was really good and made up for it. 

I ordered the veggie lasagna (came with toast and a salad) for $13 and I felt pretty full despite having only half the portion (shared the rest with my friend). They're pretty generous with their servings. Another friend of mine ordered orange pekoe tea and it came in a small tea pot with a cup, a spoon, and a cute creamer jug. We filled two and a half cups - which was pretty good considering she only paid around $3 for the tea.

A+ to the presentation.

Anyways, I'd say the price is pretty fair, ranging from $4-14 ish, on most foods items (not drinks). I guess you get what you pay for (so healthy!). It's definitely better on your wallet when you can share with a friend though.

DESPITE the strange first encounter, glaring ladies, and some misunderstandings... You can tell they tried their best with service (they must have felt a little impatient with us). 

After knowing what to do now, I think I'll be going back. :p"}
{"text":"Mocha Mocha is a great choice on the Danforth for any meal of the day. My prefereance is to eat there around brunch/lunch time, but it does get very busy.  Tables are situated close together, so don't choose this place if you're going on a first date (unless you want to hear everyone else's conversation and babies crying) or if you're looking for a nice quiet meal.

If it's really busy, I usually grab a seat and then my hubby goes up to the counter to order for us.  It's caf styles--order at the counter, then they bring you the food.  You pay at the dessert end of the counter after you've finished your meal.  If you want water, you help yourself to the keg of water located on the counter near the entrance hallway.  The glasses are there too.

My favourite is the tuna potato cake (comes with a salad) and my Mom absolutely loves the warm brown rice salad (she will drive down from Pickering for this!)  Everytime I have eaten here, the food is always fresh and delicious.  Nothing too fancy, but just good quality meals that you can rely on everytime you visit."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, very tasty fresh food. I have only been for breakfast but the omelets are all very good."}
