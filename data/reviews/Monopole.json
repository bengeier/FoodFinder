{"text":"Monopole is absolutely wonderful.   The food is fresh and delicious, the wine selection is great, and the staff is incredibly friendly. My husband and I sat across from the kitchen and had a wonderful conversation with the chefs, which was a very nice addition to our experience.  We stopped in for lunch and had just a few small plates paired with delicious wines and could not be more pleased with our experience.   I would highly recommend Monopole to anyone looking for an overall, wonderful experience."}
{"text":"Fantastic food, friendly peeps, excellent coffee, good vibes and atmosphere. I've only visited for lunch and coffee but this is hands down the best cafe in the vicinity. Thank God it opened because I was getting tired handing over my hard earned pesos for mediocre food at Bonne Souppe. I am a really picky client but no bone to pick here ;)"}
{"text":"It's definitely a spot best enjoyed after office hours. Until 6:00PM the restaurant/café is raided by hundreds of local office workers in need for a caffeine fix. Great value, super nice owners (I met Gabriel and Julien). My favourite spot in the area."}
{"text":"This is in my opinion the best food/service experience in Montreal, offering excellent value for money. The portions are generous and there's something on the menu to satisfy most people. The dishes are really good to share if you're in the mood for that and there's plenty of interesting wine and beer as well as really tasty cocktails.   Favorite dishes: -Brocoli, pistachio, ricotta. Both oven rosted and cold sliced, pairing excellent with the pistachio and cheese. One of the better starts I've had to a meal. -Beef carpaccio with brussel sprouts, popcorn, tabasco infused whipped cream, parmesan and other stuff that makes it both innovative and extremely tasty. Don't miss out.  The location of the place is a bit anonymous, but if you chose to go there you'll find yourself in small and cosy buvette that has higher hang-out-tables, a big round social table, and many more good spot. Or treat yourself and grab a seat infront of the chefs.  This is the place you can drop by in the middle of the week, have a great meal and a nice bottle of wine without feeling that somebody obliterated your bank account. (That they're offering take-out and doubles as a café in the early hours doesn't make it worse)"}
{"text":"Quelle belle découverte! Alors que nous cherchions un bar a vin pour accueillir notre prochaine séance de club de lecture (le vin aidant les discussions sans nul doute!), nous avons choisi d'essayer le Monopole car les commentaires mentionnaient un lieu calme ou tu peux parler et en même temps avec une belle sélection de vins. Je les ai contacté pour réserver une table, me disant qu'un vendredi soir ce serait mieux d'avoir une place assurée. Quelle a été ma surprise en arrivant quand on nous a dit qu'une salle nous avait été réservée au fond du bar! Vraiment on partait deja sur un très bon pied car on ne s'attendait pas a tant d'attentions. Et toute la soirée a été une série d'attentions diverses qui vraiment nous a tous touchés. Le bar fêtait ses 1 an ce soir là et c'était un peu plus bruyant que d'habitude et le menu était changé pour l'occasion avec également du vin et des choses à grignoter offerts par la maison a l'ensemble des clients. Évidemment c'est pas le cas tous les soirs mais il est certain que l'esprit festif était bien au rendez-vous. Nous avons commandé des plats et tout le monde a adoré ce qu'ils ont essayé. Jai pris un tartare de buf et j'ai adoré les diverses textures entre les ingrédients: viande, fromage bleu, noisettes, c'était vraiment bon. La carte des vins était vraiment superbe aussi et nous avons testé pas mal de choses différentes avec aucun vin décevant, que des belles découvertes! Le staff a été genial et notre club de lecture a vraiment été un succès grace a l'ambiance du lieu et l'esprit festif de la soirée. A priori ils servent des lunchs aussi et font café le jour, bar a vin le soir. Une de mes copines y va régulièrement et elle trouve que le service est constant et qu'a toute heure de la journée le staff est aux petits soins pour les clients. Une belle place a visiter, à Griffintown et tout près du Vieux Port. J'ai trouvé qu'il était assez facile de trouver des places pour se garer dans les coins. Pas de doute, j'y retournerai!"}
{"text":"Excellent americano. Up there with some of the best in Montreal. Probably my second or third favourite."}
{"text":"Walked by and decided to stop in for a coffee but was seduced by a pile of chocolate chip cookies that would not let me leave without taking one home.  So glad I followed my heart.  Oh and any Aussies or Kiwis in town?  They have flat whites!"}
{"text":"This is the place that your veggie hating baby will eat veggies dishes they create. super friendly staff and all the dishes we had were good."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went to Monopole on a Friday night. The initial plan was just to stop in for a glass of wine and an appetizer and the go somewhere else for dinner but we ended up staying till past midnight and had dinner and wine there.   We each started with a glass of red wine and shared the parsnip, bacon and aïoli dish. Before then I don't think I ever ate parsnips but it was surprisingly good! It was my favorite dish and yet it was pretty simple. Then we had the cavatelli with pumpkin and chanterelles mushroom followed by another glass of red wine. The pasta was also pretty delicious.  Lastly we had the Jerusalem artichoke because two of the staff recommended it. Unfortunately it was my least favorite dish.  It was ok. It tasted a bit smokey to me and I'm not really a fan of that. I thought it would be good because they put a layer of cheese and then flame it.   I really enjoyed the red wines. There was two that I particularly enjoyed. My favorite out of the two was the Cardin. I think they change the wine selection and even the food menu pretty often.   Although the wine and food were good, I'm mainly giving this place five stars because of the service. I was very impressed with the owner. He came around taking our order and at one point we wanted to try another glass of red wine and he said \" follow me... \" then we went into the wine cellar and he let us try all the red wine bottles he had opened that night! There must have been five wines that were open! It was fun doing a bit of wine tasting! That was so nice of him ! There was one bottle in particular that we really enjoyed but there was only about a glass and a half left so he gave us what was left of the bottle for the price of one glass. That's pretty generous of him.   This wine bar specializes mainly in vegetable dishes and let me tell you these dishes are so tasty! In all honesty think it helps that it is served with a lot of cream or with other ingredients that make it flavourful like bacon or cheese. I'm not a big fan of veggies but if veggies were normally served like this I think I would eat it more.   I will definitely be back and I highly recommend it!! This place is a six min walk from my boyfriend's condo so it's very convenient! I'm also curious to try their meat dishes because we sat at the bar and the pan seared pork shoulder dish looked so good!"}
{"text":"A gorgeous restaurant in Griffintown located on Wellington, close to the famous statue of Source on Bonaventure expressway. I went there on the quiet day, which is Saturday, to try their brunch, which changes regularly depending on the inspiration of the cook. From Monday to Friday they serve coffee, lunch and supper, but then weekend they have the brunch and close earlier than usual. The wine at Monopole is a big selling point, since the owners take much pride in it, and actually name the restaurant Monopole because they love the manga Les Gouttes de Dieu so much and the protagonist's favorite bar is called Monopole. The plating of Monopole is really an art and their wine also remarkably good. The ambiance is super nice and the decor really tasteful. Totally recommending this place!"}
