{"text":"after the restaurant makeover'd massimo's on college burnt down, they built this place right next to my work (how convenient!)  it's pretty standard za, it looks similar to the big slice but isn't nearly as shitty. I almost always get the margherita, it's loaded with garlic and other fun/non-invasive spices. they have hot sauce and pepper flakes to throw on if thats your thing.  the place isn't as nice as the old location after the makeover but it's spacious and the bathrooms are well maintained (normally I wouldve give a shit * but my work doesn't have a bathroom).   dope slice and an apple/orange juice for 5 bucks. or go nextdoor to pizza pizza for the same deal if you're a wiener.  * pun!"}
{"text":"Very rude.  Their website states that they are open from 11am to close Mon-Sat.  I tried to go there for lunch on Saturday.  When I got there the door was open, so I went in.  However, the chairs where all up and there was a man inside mopping the floor.  When I asked him whether the place was open he sarcastically said \"Does it look like we're open\".  I tried to tell him that the website stated that they would be open for lunch, but all he could do was keep sacrastically saying \"does it look like we're open?\".  He didn't even say what their hours were or anything!  I got so frustrated I stated, \"If you don't want me as a customer I'm leaving!\".  So unbeliveably rude!  Stay away!"}
{"text":"A delicious slice. Simple, classic and unpretentious pie. The owner makes his own jalape√±os for those looking for a little extra kick. Highly recommend you opt for Massimo's over the more sophisticated looking shop next door."}
{"text":"Huge slice. $4. Greasy and good."}
{"text":"This place is one of the only pizza slices in the city that is recommendable. I find this city lacks places to get a good slice of pizza. Massimo's, though not as good as some joints in cities like NY, represents the small percentage of good pizza in this city.  For for $4, you get a large slice and it's open late."}
{"text":"So after reading a few of the reviews, merely the ones that gave an average rating i think they've got it all wrong i mean for 1 the price at $4 bucks a slice or should i say 2 slices in one is more than a bargain expecially for a fast food pizza joint that is located along the strip of Queenwest with all the bars and clubs around it you'd think they would take advantage of the guaranteed customers. damn, i hope none of the workers or owner's read this hahahaha. but come on seriously, if you had a choice to eat at garbage pizza pizza and pay $5 bucks a slice (yes, 1 slice) you'd be satisfied with that? I doubt it. anyhow, as for the pizza itself, got to LOVE that Caprese. can't get enough of that pizza. I've tried some others but they can't amount to the Caprese. Aside from their enormous slice they use the most important thing, FRESH INGREDIENTS. need i say more. As for their hot food, never had so i can't comment.   Overall, if you are looking for a quick bit to eat and craving for pizza i highly recommend Vinny's Massimo's Pizza!!!"}
{"text":"Its been a week and I'm still raving about this Pizza. It was sooo good I had to go into the back and just tell them how good it was. If this site is meant for just giving feedback on the food itself...well then do yourself a favour and try this pizza. You wont be disappointed."}
{"text":"The slices here are delicious and pretty large.  This is solid pizza joint that offers delivery and slices and might be my favourite pizza joint (non gourmet or restaurant) in town.  I usually drop for a slice but I recommend getting a fresh slice if possible as the guy working the counter may or may not heat it properly!  I like this place more than Pizzaiolo and that horrible orange sign place down the street.  I recommend a cold slice here over the orange place down the street."}
{"text":"Good pizza, but can be wildly inconsistent.  I've had gorgeous slices and then hideous ones a few days later.  How long it's been since coming out of the oven is the main thing, the pizza doesn't seem to sit well, and the oil becomes unappetizing.  If you live in the neighborhood it's a good place to get delivery from, since it'll be hot and fresh."}
{"text":"I don't know why I wanted so very much to like this place and it's food. Maybe because it was an alternative to the garbage pizza chain down the block. Or maybe it was because it was run by what seemed like regular Joe Italians. I dunno. But honestly I don't find anything about their pizza that's noteworthy aside from the fact they seem to use real cheese as opposed to the processed stuff.   I've tried a few of their slices and well...It's OK, better than Pizza Pizza, but that's about as far as it goes. I've eaten pizza from all over the city from franchise to gourmet and I honestly don't feel there is anything about Vinny Massimo's that makes it stand out. Furthermore, why so skimpy on the toppings? For what they charge for a slice they shouldn't sprinkle their toppings with such a degree of cost cutting reservation.  As for pasta, I did try their spaghetti and meatballs and again it was merely OK. Was it worth what I paid for it? Not really. Maybe I'm fussy, maybe I don't get it, but I expected more out of my experience from this place. Too it's not exactly the most appealing place to sit and eat, absolute bare minimum in seating and decor to open the business with.   I'm giving the place a generous 3 stars as it is smack in the middle OK but really meh, I've had better. I guess 2 1/2 stars would be about right."}
{"text":"Best Pizza?  Best cheapest pizza?  Greasiest pizza?  Couldn't tell you but I do know that their pizza is good and I have returned many times.  This is one of the many pizza icons in the city and should be taken seriously.  They usually only have 4 or 5 types going at one time but they always seem to be fresh, indicating a steady flow of clientele and warm pizza.  Pizza Margherita - herbs & spices, tomato sauce, cheese topped with garlic parsley oil   Pizza Giardinetto - black olives, mushrooms, grilled eggplant & zucchini, sundried tomatoes, cheese & tomato sauce"}
{"text":"I ordered pizza here the other night with some friends, we chose Massimo's (the reincarnated!) to be the food purveyor to our drunken shenanigans. And while the pizza was not as heavenly or chi-chi as terroni's or libretto's offerings, it did the job of filling us up suitably.   We ordered two large's: their famous margherita and the vinny massimo special-a mix of tomatoes, proscuitto (special substitution)green peppers, bacon and onion. The marg was delicious with its blend of bubbly cheese, sweet tomato sauce and their trademark basil/garlic oil that marks the pie in splotches.   Massimo's crust is too thick and was the weakest link, dry, not crispy hot or chewy. Our special pizza was loaded up on all the ingredients, the bacon and proscuitto being the most tasty elements of the pie with their salty, fatty flavours.   Service is rather sketchy here. We were told it would be a half hour wait for pick up and upon arriving it seemed that our order had not been worked upon yet-hence another 20 minute wait. They do delivery, take out and there's some sparse seating for eating in.   A tentative three stars for now."}
{"text":"Once a week. At LEAST. Without fail.  Also I'm almost 100% positive that their \"Caprese\" pizza was MY idea. When they first opened my weekly pizza order was a large pizza with bocconcini, basil, tomatoes and garlic & parsley oil. Then one day I ordered my usual pizza and they were all, \"You mean the Caprese pizza?\" and then my brain exploded. I don't think they put basil on it anymore, though... Hm.  Anyhow. My favourite greazy-ass delivery pizza in town, hands down."}
{"text":"After reading the praises of this place via multiple online sources, I jumped on the opportunity for some hot calzones to be delivered for dinner on a cold winters night. I enjoyed their ingredient options and they were a good size, however the end product was pretty greasy and worst of all, there was no marinara for dipping!  Calzone without marinara is blasphemy in my eyes, but either way these weren't all that impressive to begin with. The calzone hunt continues, elsewhere."}
{"text":"Great pizza, every time I go there I try something new and it's always good. I would recommend this place if your looking for something a bit more authentic tasting"}
{"text":"Ok sooo I've gotten the pizza here a bunch of times and I went last night when I was walking on Queen west and got incredibly hungry. I enjoyed half of my slice - greasy, thin, cheeeeeesy. Then I found a short black hair on the side of the pizza. I tried to take it off but it was baked right in. The guy working there was yelling at someone on the phone so I just threw it out and left O____o. Probably won't be back for a really really really long time and also will have to have been drinking."}
{"text":"I was disappointed. The server was surly and lazy. The selection was pretty weak. The pizza was barely warm because the lazy surly server barely re-heated it. Plus, the price was ludicrous! $4 for a slice??? At Pizzaoilio they give you twice the pizza for the price, and it tastes good!! I won't bother again. Serious disappointment."}
{"text":"Definitely some of the greasiest pizza in Toronto, but also some of the most delicious. They're open until 4:00am on the weekend, so it's definitely a great option for some post-drinking grub, but you might have to do battle with some intoxicated assholes. Mind you out-of-towners still seem to flock to the Pizza Pizza next door, leaving a clear path for those who know the deal.  I've never stayed here to eat my slice -- I usually just grab some napkins and I'm inhaling my food on the sidewalk. It's not a very inviting atmosphere late at night, with people slumped in their seats and garbage scattered on the tables, but I've walked by during the day and it seems a little more pleasant.  The pizza is always fresh. It's nowhere near that re-heated stale cardboard texture their neighbours serve up. And their late-night availability makes this place a no-brainer for that area of Queen West."}
{"text":"My friend who works across from this place introduced me to it. Really nice owners (always telling people to wait for a fresh pizza to come out) and amazing pizza. Some people might find it a bit greasy, but hey pizza isn't the healthiest food to begin with. The Margherita and Boccaccini slices are my favourites"}
{"text":"We stopped ordering from there a couple months ago.  The pizza was never consistent ... sometimes it was awesome, other times it was cold and burnt.  Sometimes they'd forget to put the bacon on so would try and sneak it on at the end (so the bacon was raw and the rest of the pizza was burnt).  Not a big surprise they have closed."}
{"text":"4.5 stars amongst the usual pizzariea's -pizza hut, pizza pizza, etc) 3.5 stars compared to neopoiitan pizzariea;s - amatto's, pizzaiolo, falsaca, liberty, etc  The caprese is definitely one of the best they have on the menu (tomato's, boccacini, basil, etc).  + points for being open till 4am! + points for thin crust + points for the sauce + points for using olive oil + points for real cheese + points for generous slices at reasonable 4 buck slice   The great thing about this place is the more places like these open up, the more we can weed out the garbage from the city from demand. Pizza pizza next door needs to close! It's pizza at the end of the day - but A call to real italian new york style pizza. thankyou independant owners!  p.s shout out to RC for introducing me to this place."}
{"text":"Your typical pizza joint.  Except that their slices are HUGE.  They are so big that they don't even fit on the paper plates they serve the slice on.  It would probably take two paper plates for a slice to fit because they are that humongous.  Aside from their huge size, they are also quite tasty, filling, and reasonably priced.  There is a pizza pizza very close to this place but I believe under most circumstances I would choose this place over pizza pizza.  I am impressed."}
{"text":"as far as pizza goes this place is alright. in terms of ambiance it's about as inviting as CAMH.  i was in there last night after work, and there was this large, unshaven  man surfing porn on his laptop right by the cash register... i REALLY hope he's not managment...  this pizza will most likely make you fart. if you're cool with that, chow down."}
{"text":"Greasy and good. Huge slices, and I love how the pepperoni is on top of the cheese and gets crispy. It's my thing.   I'll be back, and I'll enjoy you, but I won't crave you and seek you out."}
