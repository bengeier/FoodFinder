{"text":"I live right by this place, there isn't really anywhere else to order from... for the past 2 years our delivery orders were pretty much wrong Every single time! No exaggeration!  Weather it was for getting a sauce, forgetting toppings (which you pay for!) Cold food, wrong drinks, eyebrow hair in my sour cream! No ketchup in 2 banquet burgers?! The best part is when you call back they argue with you! The Worst customer service iv ever experienced. Also when the order is wrong and they come back to give you your new order they ask for the food back!! Lol!! There's too many times to list, I still order because I like burakas and it's close but definitely check your order before you pay! Also they told us the slices are warmed up from the night before if u get slices when they open so make sure you don't get slices in the A.M! Haha......"}
{"text":"Received a pizza with the wrong toppings, pepperoni instead of tomatoes. Because my daughter started to eat it (and discovered the pepperoni) they wouldn't fix the mistake.
Terrible customer service. We live down the street from this place and will choose to go else where from now on- someone who appreciates their customers."}
{"text":"We started from ordering from diamond pizza recently.  
First the most  part we have been very happy with the promptness of the delivery and the quality of the food.  That was until recently we tried a couple choices on the menu we had not ordered before.  My wife ordered the veal on a bun she said it had no flavour and tasted like something she could have taken out of the friezer and cooked at home.  I thought I would try thwas not good quite expensive considering what you got also a little small and frankly no flavour.  We will forget those menu choices in the future because for the most part there food we feel is excellent the panzeretto were very small we will forget the pizza and panzeretto choices in the future."}
{"text":"There are way too many other options for ordering pizza to choose this place again. My pizza must have been sideways en route because it arrived with all of the cheese bunched on one side and soggy dough on the other. The cheese wasn't even fully melted. How hard is it for a pizza restaurant to make a pizza?!"}
{"text":"I ordered from their Main Street location and would certainly not recommend it simply for their \"Customer Service.\"  This place is relatively close to me in location and so felt it would be convenient, though BEWARE, if your order is wrong, YOU are the liar.  Last Summer I ordered two panzerotto's, and the ingredients in one of them contained tons of hot peppers, and I cannot eat spicy. They told me I was lying and hung up on me!  Waste of money and no dinner for me. One year later, I decided to try again.  I asked to add ingredients to a poutine, which friends of mine always does that lives in my building, and even though I was very polite the angry woman told me that they do not do this and when I told her I would pay extra she yelled and told me they do not do this (you make pizza, how difficult is this to throw some mushrooms on top, especially knowing they've done this for friends of mine). I had to hang up on her since she was losing it, and I ordered from somewhere else.  Food is your regular cheap and greasy hangover food, but TERRIBLE service.  I will never order from there again and will certainly not encourage others to do so."}
{"text":"should have read there reviews about customer service ordered delivery they said about 45 min alomost 2 hrs late still no pizza had to call to cancel sorry folks don't want fresh delivey! utter Dissapointment!"}
{"text":"I ordered 90 bucks worth of food witch involved a party size pizza when the order came the most important thing was missing the PIZZA! As the driver Apologized he went back to get my pizza and I I talked to the manager he was very rude and very vulgar they told me that it would be five minutes it was really 20 minutes by the time it came they wouldn't take the pizza off for me and they wouldn't do me a deal so I paid the whole 90 bucks Service was terrible I do not recommend this to nobody you're better off ordering from pizza pizza!!!"}
{"text":"We have lived in this area for 25 years. We have always ordered from Diamond's but in the last few years we have ordered less and less as the quality of food is getting worse. We ordered a home burger which is one of the few good things still left. We also ordered the haddock and fries and a caesar salad. When the fish arrived my jaw dropped. It looked like a burnt pop tart. We received ONE piece of fish with our order. And we didn't get tartar sauce. When I called the restaurant I was advised the tartar sauce is only given \"on request\" - which we did request. They also confirmed they always only serve one piece of fish. The fish was as long and as thin as an iPhone 5. It tasted like a frozen fish stick. This was by far the worst order I've had for delivery from any restaurant. The restaurant expected us to wait for the next driver to return to be able to have the sauce sent out... Diamond's is literally one block from our house. Overpriced and poor quality. Beware when ordering..."}
{"text":"guilty pleasure: indulging in delivery, 

and this place definitely had a lot of options that suited every mood. but they have the WORST costumer service. I let it pass the first time, even the second time i said 'probably a bad day', but the third time is just too much. 

The first time i ordered from there I had missed the delivery guys first call and caught the second call of which was the 'call center/office', and the woman said 'My driver is at your door and trying to call you, do you want the food?'..trust me, it wasn't a nice tone. i understand how annoying it can be when customers don't answer so i actually felt bad. any way we went downstairs and let him in and he was wailing in a loud tone saying he was going to die in the cold, and if he did it would be my fault. he said \"why do i always get these calls?\", while he was moaning and complaining i had paid on the machine and tipped him $8 - once he saw that he instantly flipped and started smiling and apologizing. Still though, it was un-real. 

The second time our pizza was late by 40 mins and when i called to find out the status there was no apology, just 'were very busy today, it'ill be there soon.'..the pizza ended up being extremely soggy! But since we were all so hungry we ate it anyway...i ate mostly the fries..

The third time we ordered ( i was hesitant, trust me) it was a group of us, one guy called it in and when the woman on the phone asked for the phone number, he simply said one second and asked out loud for the home phone #. The woman on the phone instantly said \"call me back when you figure out your number and hung up!!!!

I appreciate good food, but when the customer service lacks so much its really hard to get past. i will NOT be ordering from there again!"}
{"text":"Closed on the holiday long weekend for DineSafe violations. Not a good sign at all.  So many other options on the Danforth to choose from.  Unlikely to return here even if they reopen soon since the Yelp reviews are mostly negative."}
{"text":"DO NOT ORDER FROM THIS PLACE! Terrible customer service!
Ordered a banquet burger, a double burger and a large poutine at 5:30pm today. On the just eat website their page explained that delivery can take anywhere from 45 minutes to an hour. We waited an hour and 27 minutes then finally called and asked when our food would be arriving. The lady on the phone had no idea where her driver was and simple said \"he should be there.\" Then, she tried to tell me that the driver called me, but I never got a call from him or the restaurant. Then she tried to tell me that he left over 45 minutes ago which doesn't make any sense considering we live near Don Mills and Eglinton and it only takes 15 minutes to get here from their location. After that I told her I didn't want to order anymore and that it should not take over an hour to recieve a simple order of burgers and a poutine. She didn't listen to anything I said and kept repeating, \"well the driver is downstairs,\" which he wasn't. I told her one again that I do not want the order and then hung up. Five minutes later the driver calls and says hes here.
So basically waited almost two hours for a very simple order and didn't even get my food. Thanks diamond pizza for the shitty service."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I have been customers for many many years. Actually, Diamond was the first place we ever ordered from together and it is kind of a part of our relationship as we have been enjoying their food several times a month since we started dating. The food was always fantastic until recently. I went to order tonight and I noticed that their priced have gone up significantly. We decided to order tonight anyway as that was what we wanted to have, but made a mental note that we couldn't afford to order as often anymore. When we got our food we noticed a noticeable reduction in portion size. I ordered the small souvlaki meat only portion. It was 4 tiny pieces of chicken for $4.50. That's 1.13 per piece!! What a joke! Additionally, I asked for my salad dressing on the side and they forgot to send it. So I had to eat a dry salad. They did give me a credit on my account for a free salad next time though. The woman was fairly apologetic too. Unlike some of the other reviewers, I have never had a rude employee.. I am just very disappointed at the lack of value these days. Diamond has been around forever and has very loyal customers that don't deserve to pay more for less quality.."}
{"text":"My hubby and I moved into the hood in 2012 and Diamond Pizza instantly became one of our local go to places for ordering in...weekly...

Great thick crust pizza....we get the 5-topping special with the toppings on top of the cheese...omg...to die for. Pretty decent rotisserie chicken too.

When we feel the need to work off some of those calories, we just walk over for a huge pepperoni slice. The staff is super nice."}
{"text":"I was craving a gyros on a pita while the Taste of the Danforth was going on, Go figure!! There was NO WAY I would get anywhere close to the Danforth on a sunday during the festival so thought I would go to Diamond Pizza.
   It was nothing special but not bad either. The food was a bit crunchy so I made myself believe it was due to over-grilling. The meat was not on a spit like most places but rather pre-sliced for easy prep.
  The place is a bit more cleaned up then I remember and believe me that is a good thing. If you are close by it is not a bad place to check out but if you want gourmet food? Go elsewhere, this is what it is a greasy spoon, drunken, craving place for food."}
{"text":"First time I ordered from this pizza restaurant. The food was awful. The calzone was deep fried with the meat sauce on the side???? First time, last time."}
{"text":"I've actually been here a couple of times when I first moved to the area..only ever tried their onion rings and chicken souvlaki on a pita but on my 3rd visit I saw a cockroach scurry by the pizzas and that was a nope for me, walked out and never been back since. This was a while ago, I think they shut down for a bit(probably health related) but they are open for business now though I haven't been back."}
{"text":"I am updating because we have visited a few more times over the 3-4 years since I wrote my first review.

Don't let the name fool you - don't be mislead - DO NOT GET PIZZA HERE! You will be disappointed. The pizza isn't anything to write home about, but a couple of the other menu selections are great - go for them instead!

Favourites:
1. Greek Salad
2. Chicken
3. The magical rice

They have long hours, and they fill an area fast food gap. They have lasted impressively long, likely because of this!"}
{"text":"I heard some very positive reviews but like a lot of family run places there was a lot of nostalgia that effected everyone's opinion of this place.  

I don't understand places like this, there are some places run by cheapskates that won't hire more than two teenagers who work at minimum wage yet when I go into this place there are at least 6 men in the 50's working.

I've gone a few times and each time the customer service is as advertised her AWFUL, it feels like these guys would rather all just hang out and whats wrong with you to come in and mess up their good time and order a pizza.

In the end the pizza is good, not excellent, not really a gem just something that didn't go out of business."}
{"text":"Absolutley nothing to rave about here. The crust is dry and heavy and their sauce is way too salty. Too bad because I was really hoping to have fiund a local pizza joint close to home that makes delish pizzas. The search continues as I am now way out of the delivery range of my fave delivery pizza joint - King Slice."}
{"text":"Good service, average pizza, horrible garlic bread."}
{"text":"Ordered through Just eat. Driver came to our building and refused to bring the food to our door. Says there was no safe place to park his car. See photo of his car, parked safely. Store called and asked us to go down and get it as the driver did not want to leave his car for fear of towing. We live in a building with aprox 70 units, deliveries happen all the time, you would have to leave your car in the spot for 24 hours before anything would be done. The amount of time he sat in his car was triple what it would have taken to get out and bring it to our door.

Manager at Diamonds was rude on the phone and hung up on us.

Did not get to try the food."}
{"text":"Burekas is good,add bacon. And they're panzerotto's too... wings are poop, don't order, ever..  has lots of good items and a few duds... I pick up from them all the time... oh yea they have 2 locations.. Stay far away from the Danforth rd (Scarborough) location... they are straight garbage. Not the same quality at all, a boiled egg dropped on the floor is tastier then the \"food\" they sell"}
{"text":"One of the better pizza joints in the city. If you like the combination of 'Montreal style' pizza with good dough. That MTL style I'm a fan of - smothering most if not all toppings with cheese.  Not for the thin crust pizza lovers, their dough doesn't have the same consistency and taste as cardboard, that's a good thing. 

Greek menu and I've only ordered their Greek style fries. Haven't ordered anything else on the menu.
Good food in a dive like place.  Not for the ambiance driven diners, but for pizza lovers."}
{"text":"This place is the worst. Literally missed a bunch of delivery items, told me they would bring them, forgot, told me they would give me credit, then told me they had no record of my credit when I tried to use it. They were super rude the whole time like I was trying to steal a $6 item. I was a super long term customer. Fuck these guys."}
{"text":"Worst service and food ever! Rather sit on the phone than serve us our cold, soggy food. Zero customer service skills at this restaurant, should have offered us our money back but I guess returning customers are not important to them. Will never be back."}
{"text":"I'm used to the food from the main st. Location, and it didn't really compare. Also, forgot the chicken on my salad,  as well as croutons."}
{"text":"Use to be an amazing place both to order in or take out. Went there today and was terribly disappointed. The floors under the counter were disgusting. Looked like they hadn't moved the gum machine to clean. Actually liked like some food stuffs were  on the floor. It is a shame because they used to have the best food. I asked to use the washroom while waited for my order. I was told it was an employee only washroom. Seriously? It wasn't like I walked on off the street wanting to use their bathroom. Food was mediocre at best . Parking lot needed to be salted or sanded. Won't be back"}
