{"text":"This place is my number one pick for hot pot bowls!  I loved the broth!  In fact, I finished it before I finished the vegetables, meat and noodles!  The items I  picked were the lamb, sausage, leek, seaweed knots and wide noodles.  The minimum charge is $10. a bowl, so you might as well keep adding goodies until you hit the minimum, right?  Did I mention that the mild broth was the high light of my meal?  The time passes quickly while watching the food travel network on the tv screens in the smallish seating, industrial decor dining area.   Our meal would have arrived earlier if the server wasn't on his phone, much of the time, but he was pleasant and aimed to please, when at our table.  I plan to return to have another custom combination and devour every last drop of their broth!  Did I mention that I loved their soup base?  ;)"}

{"text":"This place is in an odd area I'll be honest. It's almost random of where this restaurant is located. But besides that, this is a \" create your own\" style of place. So there's no set styles of soups you can order. I chose the beef broth with beef slices, some vegetables and a few extra add ins like tofu.  **** There is a minimum amount of what you can have in your soup, otherwise you'll be charged a fee.  For example, if you only have $10 worth of your soup, you either add more and reach the minimum amount, if not you'll be charged a fee******  I recommend this place for the experienced palettes of more unique flavors. While you have a lot of different proteins you can add."}

{"text":"I'm a big hot pot fan and this isn't really hot pot, it's more like a build your own bowl of noodle soup. Which is fine. I ordered #2 spicy and my husband ordered #3 spicy. In terms of spicyness for my level 2 is fine. But my husband's level 3 wasn't spicy it's more like they added an extra bowl of chili oil making it really hard to sip on the soup. We ordered beef slices, lamb slices, beef tripe, enoki mushrooms, fish tofu, and dry tofu. The meat slices weren't on par to our expectations so that was a thumbs down. The beef tripe was definitely poorly cooked because it was so hard and chewy you can't even bite into it. Mushroom and fish tofu was good as expected at any other places. Their wide noodles were good, can't really go wrong with that. Overall service was good and food was not too great. Probably won't come back but it was worth a try."}
{"text":"Food is good. Service is good. They have a lot items that you can choose and how spicy you like to add."}
{"text":"A rhyming haiku of our experience:  Craving Chinese food Spicy hot pot fit the mood Off to eat at Kood  This restaurant offers primarily hot pot, but not the cook your own kind. Each person has an individual menu where you can mark off how many servings of what hot pot item you'd like and you can also specify your spiciness level for the broth. There are also some combo options available such as pork belly and beef which include vegetables and a drink. The kitchen will prepare all your hot pot items for you and you'll get your big ol' bowl of broth with heaping proteins and veg!  We shared a triple meat bowl with beef, pork belly and calamari with various veggies and tofu, spice level medium. We also shared a dipping sauce. The bowl was a fairly large size, and there were a good portion of hot pot items in our order. Of all the meats I enjoyed the pork belly the most, and my favorite vegetable was the lotus root. The dipping sauce was a generous plate of Sichuan seasonings in oil, a salty spicy melange. It could easily be shared by two or more people.   The prices were very fair for what we got, especially considering the really expensive prices at other similar hot pot restaurants.  I thought it was odd that the restaurant is labeled as a tea bar and in the name that is listed first before being a cafe, when they only had 2 types of tea for sale, both in bottled form, not freshly made. The tea bottles did look unique and interesting, but since I was told they were in bottles I thought they were some generic store bought type tea when we placed our order. When I saw other customer's bottles that intrigued me since I had never seen that brand of tea before so I might have to try a bottle next time.  Service was friendly but succinct. Our server spoke both Mandarin and English. One small suggestion would be to also offer spoons with the bowls so you can have some of the flavorful spicy broth along with your hot pot, and it would also help customers be able to fish out their hot pot items better."}
