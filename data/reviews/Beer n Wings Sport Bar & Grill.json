{"text":"They deserve less than one star. 

The only good was the fries had a great seasoning and the huge selection of wing flavours.

The \"hot\" wings really weren't although I understand that's relative. My fish and chips was the worst I've had. It was overcooked and so dry that I think the last quarter would make a suitable hammer. The waitress barely looked at us again once she heard \"Groupon\" and we ended up leaving early since she hadn't come around in 20 minutes so we could get more drinks. 

Also who in the world served fish and chips and didn't have any tartar sauce (and barely knows what tartar sauce is). I know it's a wing place but don't put it on the menu if you're not sure what it is."}

{"text":"I've been here a couple of times with a Groupon. I thought the wings were great. Very similar vibe to the Wild Wing franchise."}
{"text":"I almost didn't come here from the look of it, pretty empty. But I'm glad I did! The service was really pleasant and attentive. The basketball game was on the big screen. So it was an enjoyable time. We got the sweet potato fries and the 3lb wings, hot bbq and medium blue cheese flavours. The fries were crispy and good and came with a southwest sauce. The wings were really good too, crispy skinned, very saucy, and came with a creamy dip. I'll be coming again!"}
{"text":"Ordered for delivery. 1 ib. Of large breaded wings with blue cheese. Really meaty. 
Wanted mild and they erte perfect. Deep fried pickles but they forgot the dipping sauce.
Delivery was quick( skip the dishes)"}
{"text":"Wish I can give them negative scores.

They randomly make up rules on when and how you use the goupon.  Went there with three people using the groupon \"$50 Groupon toward lunch or dinner for 4\" and they wouldn't accept it...Even though I had done it in the past. When asked about it, she said it was in the fine print somewhere... When it clearly states it nowhere!!  

Horrible customer service, the lady even yelled something along the lines of cheap get cheap service, when we were leaving.  When it was a standard 15% tip for sub-par service.. which included messing up our order 2x/ long wait/ justifying the random rules on the groupon. This will be the last and final time I go there.  The food isn't worth paying full price.

But wait, there's more!! This ground is not even the $20 or $50... they ended up subtracting taxes off the groupon's value.  So the $20 value groupon we bought was onlu worth $17.40."}
{"text":"I'm surprised to see such a low score as it wasn't that bad when we came here although we got our food to go. We got our wings to go and the server was extremely nice and more than happy to help us decide what to get as it was our first time there. We got a pound each of honey garlic and sweet bbq sauce which were both good - average wings with an average price point."}
{"text":"Don't do takeout! But dine in food is good. Wings are decent! Service is good. Can be very bad like feeling and mostly men frequent lol"}
