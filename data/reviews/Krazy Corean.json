{"text":"Amazing! Staff and service was great. Loved the laid back atmosphere-dim lighting, and a very clean, open, modern concept in terms of the way everything is set up. The menu is simple, but everything was very delicious. Highly recommend the Ssam-gyup sal and Bul-na. Meat was extremely tender and flavourful, and the presentation of everything was just awesome. All the drinks were spot on. The people they have behind the bar are just talented and really know what they're doing. Perfect lighting for food porn photos too ;) .... I really enjoyed myself and definitely will be back soon! I can already tell this place is gonna be a hit."}
{"text":"Lovely dinner at a great price. Fantastic service too. Can't beat the cheap drinks and delicious bulgogi."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went to venture bars on college st. and came across the restaurant. Their food was reasonably priced and the service was quick. We ordered the Wing platter and Sea Honey. They weren't traditional Korean dishes but they were delicious!  It was our second time trying Korean food but we loved how their dishes came tapa style.   I asked the bartender if they had any warm beverages and the server suggested hot sake but the bartender made his signature drink that was not on the menu- it was hot cocktail called Sunset on College st. I loved it!   We will definitely return especially before the hype catches on and the restaurant gets busy."}
{"text":"Everything on their menu was a bit different from other restaurants I have been to. Very familiar taste with a bit of twist to them. Hard to figure out what they would actually taste like (or look like) until they actually come out The prices were very reasonable and I love the fact that you are able to share all dishes with your friends try out different dishes. Cocktails were great. They tasted as good as the cocktails in expensive bars in the city without me having to pay 12~14 dollar per drink. Vibe was good and staff was friendly. Advised it was recently opened hence not too many people, but a great place to go with your friends if you guys are open to sharing food and want to actually hear each other talk."}
{"text":"$10 lunch special and great service! Will come again.  The place is decorated with vintage books that you can read and the decor is adorable."}
