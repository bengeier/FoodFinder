{"text":"This is probably the best Poké restaurant in Charlotte! The staff is friendly and the place is clean! I built my bowl with shrimp and bluefin tuna. My favorite sauce is yuzu wasabi and Poké sauce. I picked my veggies and added crabmeat salad and avocado at the end. Highly recommend anyone to try this weekly to try out different combinations! I love how fresh the food is here. I travel a lot for work so I've tried a lot of other Poké and this is one of the best ones I've been to."}
{"text":"Great service! I went with a build your own because none of the recommended bowls seemed like a good fit. Maybe they need a couple more suggestions there? Fish was fresh, lots of toppings and ingredients to choose from. Nice and light lunch option."}
{"text":"You basically pick what kind Rice you want, then what kind of protein goes into the bowl -usually sushi but also have Chicken and vegetarian options. Then you pick what kind of sauces you want and what kind of vegetables.

I went very skeptically but absolutely loved it. My wife is been there twice for lunch already in one week and we went for dinner

Very reasonably priced. Serves no alcohol."}
{"text":"Hello Hawaii in Charlotte! My Hawaiian native friends recommended this location. I had the signature Hawaiian Poké bowl with a Hawaiian Sun brand Green Tea w/ Lychee! IT-WAS-DELICIOUS! I can only give 4 stars though because the price was very high for the portion size. After tip I had spent $18 on a regular sized bowl and the canned drink  I thought the regular sized bowl was supposed to be $11 and the large bowl $13, so perhaps there was a mistake on my bill. The employees were pleasant and helpful but they seemed to lack confidence and experience."}
{"text":"Tucked away in a strip mall is this heavenly joint for poke lovers. They have an excellent selection of toppings and fresh ingredients and the taste was phenomenal. 
If you like fresh fish and tasty food, give this a shot."}
{"text":"The fish is fresh and the Poké bowls are tasty -but be forewarned- the portions can be sparse and inconsistent depending who serves you.  My first visit was great, my server was friendly and helpful and my Small bowl was a good portion. Second visit was a different story.  I ordered a Large bowl and got far less than my last visit. Each topping that I selected they'd remove some and leave me less. I had three sprouts at one point and asked for more it was so ridiculous. Surreal. I'll think twice about returning."}
{"text":"Size is small & I'm not a huge fan of their house poke sauce. Fish is good and doesn't taste fishy  great staff and clean environment. But the price isn't worth. There's another poke place 10 minutes that I'd rather go to. But this is definitely a good location in a place like this!"}
{"text":"I love poke! Went there for lunch for the first time. We sampled a lot of menu items!  It looked so good we just couldn't not restrain ourselves. The flavor combinations are amazing.  Be adventurous. The seafood is SO fresh.  The people are very nice and helpful. Thank goodness, the menu is not that simple for a first timer."}
{"text":"I've been here at least half a dozen times and every single time I can't wait to go back. Everything is made to order, fresh ingredients, and well priced. I'm poke obsessed because of this place! So good!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite poke in charlotte.   The ingredients is super fresh and the sauce they added on it is super delicious.   Since it's close to my gym I always stop by afterward.   The good is super healthy and nutritious if your on a diet.   Will definitely come back again!!"}
{"text":"I am thrilled to eat Poke! I ordered the Large bowl with salmon, ahi tuna and spicy salmon (3 meats)
Seaweed salad is extra $1 and divine! I added masago, cucumber, edamame, pickled ginger, pineapple and sesame seeds and cilantro toppings. The tempura crunch topping is a delicious contrast. I think the price is worth the cost, it's like sushi rolls--you pay good money for quality tasty fish and it's a wonderful dinner.   I had heard about poke for months and it's fabulous, like sushi grade tuna and salmon. Fabulous fish like this is meaty and savory and yummy!!

The service is great and I enjoyed my first experience with poke! Parking is easy and I will definitely return for more poke meals."}
{"text":"I'm a big sushi poke fan, and was excited to try this place while visiting. I love the setup, the place looks very clean and sanitize. All the meat and veggies looks very fresh. I'm very picky about that when it comes to my sushi. I wanted to try everything on their menu but the shrimp with Yuzu wasabi sauce bowl, caught my eye and heart.  Aside from the shrimp, it has fresh jalapeño, green onion, organic spring mix, cucumber, edamame, and crabmeat on top. The spicy mayo and the yum yum sauce makes it even more tasty. It also came with peach oolong tea which makes it a perfect combo. And the best part is they have a 30% off for grand opening but think its ending tomorrow. If you haven't made any dinner plan,  strongly suggest you try this place especially with such a great promotion they have going on now."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I ate at Genghis Grill the other night and saw this place on our way out. My girlfriend LOVES anything trendy and new and having to do with sushi so we decided to try this place out. The people behind the counter were very helpful and knowledgeable. It was a little quiet in the restaurant as they didn't have music or TVs or anything so we opted to take our food to-go. My girlfriend got the Spicy Ahi Tuna signature bowl and ate every bite of it. I opted for the Spicy Chicken Deluxe signature bowl and also finished every bite of it, I literally licked the bowl clean. We will most definitely be returning here in the future!"}
{"text":"I had never tried poke bowls prior to my visit here, & this experience was magnificent! The food was perfect. I had the spicy ahi tuna signature bowl over sushi rice. I just wasn't expecting these incredible flavors. I was delightfully surprised, & I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"New Poké place that's coming to charlotte! I got the regular bowl to test out, and I have 2 proteins for my bowl. The salmon and bluefin tuna are very fresh, and I can taste the freshness on my first bite of fish. I always go out and eat different seafood restaurant, and this is Poké place use some of best quality fish. I didn't put too much sauce in my protein, and I was surprise by their high quality fish. The portion is not too big, and the regular bowl fill me up. The fresh pineapple is a good mixture with my bowl. Highly recommend friends to come try this place and start eating healthy and fresh!"}
{"text":"A fresh and delicious alternative.  The staff is super friendly and attentive.   We'll be back for sure!"}
{"text":"I enjoyed eating there but it could have been better. They could have more vegetables or mushrooms. Since there are not many poke places in the Ballantyne area, I think it's a great place to go for poke. I have been to many good poke places in the triangle area and the options of items to put on your bowl make a big difference on the flavor. In the poke places I have been to, you do not get charged extra for pineapple or avocado."}
{"text":"Great addition to the area.  Excellent food and good people serving it.  The spicy ahi tuna is delicious!"}
{"text":"The morning after my first lunch visit at this tiny, wildly popular Ballantyne sushi joint, there are five things that stand out in my mind:

1. Everything (esp. the fish) is very fresh. 
2. Smallish serving sizes (even the large).
3. A waiting line out the door.
4. Packed parking lot and dining area.
5. A $17 tab for a large bowl plus drink.

My guess is that its target market is the health conscious young professional, aged 20-40, who walks from the nearby office parks thereby avoiding the parking snafu. Although that's not me, I did greatly enjoy the Spicy Ahi Tuna Signature Bowl (with sweet onion, scallions, masago, cucumber, shichimi crunch, pickled ginger and spicy mayo). I also appreciated the friendly service, the cleanliness and knowing that I did my body a favor; however as I walked to the car,  my stomach seemed to be thinking, \"Okay, that was a great appetizer, now what's for lunch?!\"

Still, I appreciate it for what it is and who it is for, and as such, I do recommend it, especially to sushi lovers. I might even stop by every now and then myself (but only with a coupon during off-peak hours.)"}
{"text":"The wait is over, after driving by this shopping center almost every day, Poke Cafe is finally open. Let me tell you, it has not disappointed. I have eaten here twice, and both times I have not been able to not order the spicy tuna bowl. Your fish of choice and sauce is individually hand mix in a stainless steel bowl then topped off with preset toppings or individually chosen ones. The tuna melts in your mouth and the spicy sauce compliments it so well with just a hint of spice, nuttiness, and umami flavors. The pickled ginger, masago, and crunchy tempura add layers of flavors and texture that make the bowl complete. The price may seem a bit steep, but the quality of the fish is unbelievable. The portions are not as small as they seem. I had a hard time finishing up the large bowl size. I believe that food like poke or sushi are meant to be enjoyed by their delicate flavors and not as fillers, so I don't mind paying a few more bucks for good quality food."}
{"text":"After visiting Hawaii a few times I didn't think I liked poke. I thought it was low quality sushi cuts thrown in with soy sauce. So I had been avoiding this place. Though I decided to give it a try...and I'm really glad I did. I came in at the lunch hour rush and was unsure what I wanted and the staff was super patient and helped me out as it's overwhelming if you're not sure what you like. I got the make your own bowl which was cool as you pick as many toppings as you would like. The people making the bowl had lots of suggestions. Great service. Then I had my bowl and it was awesome. Super fresh and not low grade tuna or salmon at all. Good mix of flavors. Try the poke sauce. I got the rice but they had salad as an option which would have been the healthier choice. It was a tad pricey for lunch but if you think about the sushi you are getting it is overall a good value. If you think about how much a sushi roll is....this one is just deconstructed."}
{"text":"This is my favorite go to for lunch for one of the best poke bowls in Charlotte!  Build your own with salmon,tuna ,spicy or not.  Add white warm sushi rice and pick all the traditional and not so traditional toppings you want.  A small bowl with two proteins is more than enough to satisfy.  Add a sparkling water or a fountain drink and you have a Fantastic Fresh  Meal !  Fantastic!!!!"}
{"text":"Okay so I'm addicted. Order an already designed bowl or trust them to walk you through it. Either way the results are delicious!  Fresh. Healthy. Freaking awesome!!!! Big fan!!!"}
{"text":"Its an ok place, while the food is fresh, but price is pretty high. I had a regular bowl+ fountain drink for $14. The protein portion is small while the rice they gave you was too much. One thing that they should do is mix the sauce and all the food you pick, and not just with the fish. At least this was the way I had in the other city, and it tasted much better."}
{"text":"The cat's pjs of poke! 2018.01.07

This place is phenomenal. Fish is fresh, staff is friendly.

Poke as good as California. Incredibly fair price for serving size. My favorite is the spicy yellowtail."}
{"text":"Not that impressed. We were excited to see a Poke place and went in. Maybe our expectations were higher, but it was pretty mediocre. Tried Umami and it was way more flavorful! They even have sushi burritos! 

The staff didn't seem too happy to be there. There was no line when we came in either. 

It serves its purpose,but not the best as far as taste."}
{"text":"Was only so so. Bland flavor, and very over priced. I got a large bowl and with the added cost for avocado, was $18. Yikes!"}
{"text":"I love this spot. My brother and I are actually from Hawaii and we come here every week. Their fish is good and even their yummy crab salad. Closest thing to a Poke Bowl from Hawaii. The staff are very friendly and the owner is very involved and awesome"}
{"text":"Have been reading great reviews about Poké and wanted to give it a shot.  Very minimalistic environment and tight on space.  I chose a poke bowl with the spring greens as the base.  Everything else required some guidance and the people behind the counter were helpful.  Chicken and tofu were my two proteins and very little of each were put in my bowl.  A tiny bit of cucumber, Japanese radish (very yummy), and pineapple rounded out the bowl. Oh, the tempura crumbles were recommended as my crunch.  It seemed to me that the servings were too sparse, even if it was a small bowl.  With my bottled seltzer water (ginger OH- very delicious) my total was over $16.  In my humble opinion, it was just too much money for what I had.  The quality of the food that was served was very good.  In the south, we like brewed iced tea and they didn't have it.  It just wouldn't take much to brew tea, but my guess is that they want a business that is small on space, sparse on servings, and limited on drink offerings.  It's all in the formula for staying profitable and that is what I thought about during my time at Poké.  I can understand how this could be a great lunch place option for people who work in the Ballantyne area.   I, however, will not be in a big hurry to return."}
{"text":"Truly enjoyed my experience. It's a make your own bowl of: various raw fish,chicken and tofu, with rice and sides. They also have dishes you can choose from on their menu. Think of a sushi rolls minus the seaweed wrap, in a bowl. Its very light, refreshing, filling \"in a good way\". So caution because just like anything else, sushi can be unhealthy, it can get caloric depending on what you add to it. You start to add the mayo based sauces, and high sodium sauces, it changes how health this can be but its definitely a better option than your typical fast food location. So, again, fast, tastes amazing, great if you want a healthier option but it's a little more expensive than some might want for lunch. My larger bowl was $14, not typically would want to spend for lunch. On a normal basis a lunch would come in at around $10. That said, you get what you pay for, which is why I wouldn't eliminate coming here, just not as often as I would like."}
{"text":"So delicious! It was super flavorful. The staff was super nice and helpful. You could tell they really wanted you to enjoy the food, which was so nice!  Everything was fresh and so tasty. Will become a regular here for sure. I should taken a photo of my food before i ate it all!"}
{"text":"Seeing the sign \"Hawaiian Poke\", I began waxing nostalgic and longed for the poke I used to get when growing up in the Hawaiian Islands.  I rolled in to find something very different.  This was more like a Salsarita's style \"you build it\" bowl of rice and fish.  I knew I was in trouble when the very first ingredient added to my bowl was a bunch of rice.  The fish was fresh but mixed only with some sauce before dumped on top of the rice and moved down the line to add \"additions\" to the top of the protein.  

This is a pretty far departure to the poke shops I grew up with on Oahu. Poke is a dish best described as a \"salad\" and the ingredients are mixed together with a little bit of time to allow them to marinate and blend.  It would not be unusual to find 5 or 6 kinds of different poke at a poke stand in Hawaii.  Flavors blended with various fish to create a tasty dish.  

The ingredients were definitely fresh, and the place was clean, so I'll give points for that.  The idea is great, but I wouldn't call it \"Hawaiian Poke\" by any stretch.  If you want some fish on a bed of rice, this is your place.  If you're looking for Hawaiian Poke, keep looking."}
{"text":"The food taste is pretty good. Not as flavorful as Poké I've had elsewhere, but I suspect any \"make your bowl\" ones won't be able to match the marinade of prepared Poké. 

The people there are friendly and helpful in picking out your bowl.

My biggest gripe is the food portions are way too small for the price. If you got more ingredients or prices were $3-4 cheaper I'd go back willingly. As it is, I'd pass at the current prices."}
{"text":"Came to this town for a business trip over the weekend. Glad I stopped by this place for lunch. I did a build a bowl with Spring mix base with bluefin Tuna Salmon, mixed with House poke sauce and spicy mayo. Topped with cucumber, fresh pineapple, edamame, seaweed salad, almond and tempura crunch. Wish we have something like this at our town."}
{"text":"I'm big on Poke.  It's like deconstructed sushi and I like sushi, so why not give poke a try.  OH MY, this place is delicious.  I took Sweetie and my kid that doesn't just eat pizza and chicken nuggets out to give it a try.
Nice place, a bit tight on space, but the yumminess more than makes up for it.  A bit intimidating when you first walk in, it's kind of like Subway(Blech) or Blaze pizza where you pick your own bowl.  I being a larger guy chose the 3 proteins (Bluefin tuna, spicy tuna and shrimp) on top of sushi rice.  The nice lady behind the counter guided me the whole way with suggestions.  I added the poke sauce combined with spicy mayo.  I added onions which were very potent, sprouts, cilantro, scallions, avocado, and crab salad.  Let me take a second to pay homage to the crab salad which was amazing.  Stringy pieces of surimi dressed nicely.  It really added to the bowl.  The avocado and crab salad was an extra dollar each.  They have other shakes like sesame seeds and crunches like tempura to add to the bowl. You cal also get some extra sauce when you're done since it never seems to go as far as you think.  Yum Yum Sauce was a crowd pleaser.  BTW, my daughter is gluten free and most everything can be done gluten free and they have gluten free poke sauce!  SCORE
All in all, we had a great meal.  It's a bit spendy, but what isn't these days?  I would ask that they serve brewed tea which hey, you're in the south right?  BIG FAN though, and I'll most certainly be back"}
{"text":"In a word, Amazing.

I had been wanting to try this place for weeks and I finally had a chance to take my wife. It's a very industrial feeling little spot with a Hawaiian theme, steel tables and matching chairs. That's not what brought us in though.

Their sashimi bowls are to die for. We weren't starving, so we split a regular sized Spicy Ahi Tuna bowl and added some seaweed salad for an extra buck. The portion size was surprisingly large. It didn't disappoint. The flavors meshed perfectly to be a balanced and light meal that still gave our tastebuds a wonderful journey. 

I will be recommending this place to all of my friends."}
{"text":"I enjoyed every bite. I would only complain about the amount of tuna I received in my order. Since that's the main cost of the bowl...  Food was wonderful. Could be better. I ordered the Hawaiian traditional poke bowl."}
{"text":"I'm so excited that the Poké craze has finally hit Charlotte! When I moved here from LA in September there wasn't really any places like this. Poké is just deconstructed sushi pretty much, and who doesn't love sushi? In a bowl? SOLD! I got a large bowl with extra scoop of protein, half salad half brown rice. Everything there was so yummy. If you ask to sample the sauces that they put on top of the fish, they'll let you taste it first. That's awesome since Poké is still new here, lets people try without regret."}
{"text":"This is pretty basic, but amazing. You have a bowl with the ingredients you want. Sushi grade fish or you can gobwith a meat or vegetarian or vegan. 
I got the classic salmon and my friend got the spicy citrus salmon. We both loved it!
Mine came with a poke sauce I have never had. It was flavorful, yet light enough to not over per everything. The sushi rice was excellent. You can also make your own if you don't like the signature recipes.
I will be back everytime I'm in Ballantyne."}
{"text":"I've been to a couple of different poke places, and I think this is the best.  The ingredients really are very fresh.  The pineapple is actually cut and not from a can and the salmon was good quality.  I thought that the size was quite good. A large filled my husband up just fine and I was able to split one between my three (small) children.  There is a lot of rice but it's a rice bowl so what would you expect?"}
{"text":"So fresh, delicious & friendly!  I wish there was a snack size, but otherwise amazing"}
{"text":"Yum! I've been on a poke kick so I was excited there was one in ballantyne. We came here for dinner and they weren't busy at all. It was nice to take my time to decide what I want to eat. Overall, I was pretty happy with the selections they had but they were out of sushi rice which was pretty disappointing. For my protein I got the grilled chicken and shrimp. Both were delicious!! I got onions and seaweed salad as well. The sauces are delicious and the staff is very friendly. I can't wait to go back and maybe try it with the sushi rice."}
{"text":"Similarly priced to other Poke places, fresh and filling! I tried their small bowl with two proteins; at first I thought the portion was skimpy but then I found myself barely finishing it. I do like that avocado is included and not extra. What stood out to me the most was if you are a newcomer to this type of restaurant they have pre-set bowl menu items to help you get started. I'd come back if it weren't so far away from where I live and work."}
{"text":"I created my own bowl and wow, it was delicious! The salmon and toppings were so fresh! They have so many different toppings and sauces to choose from. I am obsessed with this place!!!"}
{"text":"I'm so glad my first experience with poke bowls was at poke cafe. The fish is so fresh and delicious and they make the menu easy to understand. I've recently went to another place closer to midtown and they really can't compare. This place is hands down the best place for poke bowls. If you never tried them come here first."}
{"text":"What a find! This place opened just 3 weeks ago and I passed it on my way to my office this morning. I am in Charlotte on business and like to find healthy eating since all my meals are from restaurants. Delicious! Ordered the large bowl with sushi rice base - large comes with 3 proteins. Mine were bluefin tuna, spicy salmon and spicy tuna. Got the poke sauce (soy, sesame) with yum yum sauce on the side. I loaded up with edamame, Oshiko, scallions, ginger, crab salad, lime, masago, avocado and tempura crunch. Fresh, filling and reasonably priced. My only issue is that it takes a while to build each bowl and with only one person building it can take a bit. But go for the food!"}
{"text":"This place is sooooooo good!!!!!! Comeeee yoy wont be dissatisfied!!!  The fish is so fresh! And the owners are super nice! And their peach tea is sooo good."}
{"text":"Disappointed. I've been to these sort of places before and I had certain expectations. I felt that the selections were a little limited. I was okay with that, as the base variety was there. Quality of the food is good and seems fresh. However, I was quite dismayed at the portion size and the price you pay. The \"large\" would barely qualify as a medium in most places. The amount you get was maybe half a bowl. And at $13 ? Portion sizes are small for the price you are paying. I doubt I will repeat and will try to find something better."}
{"text":"This place is AMAZING. I have been secretly wishing that a Poké place would open in Charlotte since I stumbled upon some pictures on Instagram last year. When my boyfriend and I went to Genghis Grill the other night I saw this place as we were leaving and I, of course, flipped out and immediately googled it. I also decided right then that the next time we were in the area we'd check it out. The staff was very knowledgable and helpful, offering suggestions and substitutions. We will, of course, be returning in the future. It's a little on the pricy side but it's definitely on our Splurge Date Night list. The restaurant also doesn't have music or TVs so it's a little quiet and awkward so we opted to take our food to go. I will be recommending this place to all my friends and family to try out!"}
{"text":"Excited to have this place down the street from my office!  Cute little spot in the same shopping mall as Brazwells.  You can choose any of their signature bowls or create your own.  Super friendly and helpful staff! I've had both the Spicy Tuna and Salmon classic and both were out of this world.  Can't wait to go back!  Heads up this is more of a quick stop establishment and not something that you would reserve tables or have parties at. You're in and out."}
{"text":"Finally! Poké is spreading in Charlotte and finally a poké cafe not far from my house! Unique to Poké Cafe is it's Hawaiian influence and citrusy flavors. It is brand new and the service already exceeded my
expectations. I built my own bowl with spicy salmon, spicy tuna, and bluefin tuna with poké sauce, eel sauce, and aioli drizzle. It was Alohaoohlala ono (that's delicious in Hawaiian)!"}
{"text":"Moving from South Florida we were so psyched to find this place! It definitely is as good as we'd hoped. Great, fresh food and wonderful service. This will become a regular place for us!"}
{"text":"This place is incredible. The fish is so fresh, I love the combos you can put together yourself. I will be back, probably tomorrow"}
{"text":"Omggg this place is delicious!! A friend told me about this place and I had to get here. I got a regular bowl with salmon and shrimp, brown rice, masago, sweet onion, scallions, cilantro, avocado, crab salad and the seasoning with like 5 spices mixed together and a side of eel sauce. All this plus a bottle of water, $16. I left STUFFED. The food taste amazing. The service is polite and friendly. The restaurant is clean and the environment is relaxed. I enjoyed this so much. I will be back!!"}
{"text":"I love the Poke Cafe!  The food is incredibly fresh, the people are great, and (something I thought I'd never be saying) the Seaweed salad is AMAZING! We have become regulars here and although I hope all of you read this review I hope that not too many of you go because then the lines would be waaaaay too long. Well, I guess the owners would love you to come so forget what I just said."}
{"text":"First visit with my wife, we both liked it, very delicious. Place is clean, and the fish is very fresh (the spicy salmon was not spicy though). They do a nice job explaining to you how to order, and the choices available. Great variety. 
Only thing missing is Carrots and sweet Corn on the veggie choices. 
And Diet Coke :( 

We'll be back."}
{"text":"We visited within a week of our coupon expiring.  They denied use of the coupon, which is highly unusual and set a bad tone.  The experience was miserable.  When you spend $13 a plate at a fast food counter with bare tables, bare floors, cafeteria style service for what's billed as very fine fresh blue fin tuna, your expectations are higher.  This is hole-in-the-wall high school cafeteria ambiance.  To watch them fill a bowl is to hold your blood over a flame waiting for it to boil.  They begin by nearly filling your bowl with rice.  In my case, greens, leaving almost no room for anything else.  Were I not with a guest, I'd have walked away before the process began.  After the rice fills your bowl, they stingily, using the smallest size scoop imaginable, shaking out every piece extending beyond the scoop, and scraping off anything over the top ridge of the scoop, measure out the cheaper filler items and sprinkle them into the bowl.  We ordered the large bowl, so what they pinch into your bowl is barely noticeable and adds no flavor or texture.  Given the quality and freshness of the tuna, I cannot complain about the portion size of tuna, although you bet your life watching them stingily virtually counting each cube of tuna they put in your bowl, feel cheated.  Hotels serve larger portions of high quality tuna poke in an upscale relaxing atmosphere for about $2.00 more.  We didn't try every sauce, but their \"special poke\" sauce tastes like pure soy sauce: pure 100% regular sodium soy sauce.  It was like removing the top of a salt shaker and inverting it over your bowl.  The owners have no idea how important gracious service is.  My guest, less critical than I, said she'd never return.  It was unpleasant, run by people who behave as stingy and cheap, and too expensive to enjoy fine blue fin served in a high school cafeteria atmosphere."}
{"text":"It was my first poke bowl of my life! I loved the clean setting, the seafood and other products looked and tasted fresh.

A bit pricey, but I hope I'm paying for the fresh and safe seafood"}
