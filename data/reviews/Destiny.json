{"text":"I was inclined to love this place, I really was. The name, the decor, fantastic. However, the service simply was not. At all. After having the host AND the waitress doing a double take at our race, I was mildly annoyed. After waiting half an hour, with waitresses frequently passing by and not ONE stopping, even after we made eye contact, we were pissed. The icing on the cake was when a middle aged couple came in, and were served within 10 minutes of sitting down, while was STILL haven't been greeted by a waitress. We went up and complained about the service, were offered a mediocre apology, and then left. Never again."}
{"text":"The rule is, each person must order one thing. So if there's only 3 out of 5 people ordering... that's not good enough, they will insist you order more. However I don't know what happens if you refuse to order.  I used to think this place was a pretty decent place to sit with a small group of 3 or a pair just work on personal things that need a bit of attention, but I've noticed for the number of times I've been here; as soon as the environment gets louder, the music along with it gets louder too. It isn't until you ask them to turn it down they will. Although granted I've always come around the evening.  All and all it is a decent place to meet friends, have lunch or a snack with a side of bubble tea and desserts. The price is a bit higher than other bubble tea places. The menu comes with a large variety of choices with their drinks and food, which is nice. The drinks are a bit on the sweeter side due to them soaking the tapioca in syrup along with the drinks (especially the fruit ones) are made with syrups/purees as well [I think you can ask them to make it half sweet if needed]. Improvements should be made with the staff and consistent cake sizes."}
{"text":"My friends and I went to Destiny on Saturday night after spending a couple hours at the oh-so-crowded Night It Up. I was very full from all the food and drinks at the night market, but two of our friends were not big fans of the long line-ups and the lingering smell of stinky tofu.  It was our first visit, and we were pleasantly surprised. The restaurant is pretty big, and the decor is lovely. Simple and modern, like a comfy lounge more than a casual bubble tea house. The service was pretty good from the moment we walked in. The menu is also quite extensive. They offer the classic bubble tea flavours to sodas to smoothies, and their food menu has everything from appetizers, soups, rice and noodle dishes to desserts.  My Mango Mix drink and XO Sauce Pan-Fried Rice Rolls were pretty good. My boyfriend did not enjoy his Apple Soda, but his Beef and Kimchi Hotpot was tasty. (It's the one item our table ordered that looked a lot better than on the menu.) One of our friends liked his Chicken in Coconut Curry on Rice. However, another friend ordered Fried Crab Claws and we waited about 45 minutes for 3 tiny crab claws that cost him $10! That was definitely not worth it...   All in all, my friends and I enjoyed dining at Destiny. It is slightly pricier than your typical HK-style cafe, but it is a nice place to hang out if you're in the area. It became a lot busier by midnight, so be prepared to wait for a table if you plan to go to Destiny at a late hour."}
{"text":"My goodness. What a horrible experience! They will refuse to split your bill, and will add a mandatory 12% tip to your bill AFTER taxes. We decided to give them 10% (still after taxes), which was around $2 less than what they asked for. Two waiters then chased us out of the restaurant and demanded that we give them $5 to cover everything (showing that they can't even count money properly). Wanting to go home, as it was nearly midnight, we just forked over the money.    The service was absolutely horrid. They take a long time to understand and write down your order - and still forget parts of it. So obviously, it takes them a ridiculous amount of time to make your order as well. They angrily announce whatever drink they bring and then plop it down on the table, throwing the napkins at you. One of my friends ordered rice, and was not even given ANY utensils until she walked up to the front and asked for some. Did they expect her to eat rice with her hands?    Other than that, the drink sizes are ridiculously small for the price and the taste is quite subpar. Do yourself a favour and AVOID THIS PLACE. Try Green Grotto or Serissa for your bubble tea needs."}
{"text":"Destiny has ambience and ample seating which makes it a great place to hangout with friends or large groups of people. You can literally stay for many hours doing your homework or playing board games. The environment is very comfortable and relaxing. But besides from that, the food and drinks are mediocre.  The food is alright but it is most likely pre frozen, judging by the quickness that it took for us to receive the food and the chewy texture of it. Literally it took under 5 minutes to get our food, which to some would be great because food is speedy but it is a sign of lack of freshness. The drinks on the other hand are better than the food but are pretty expensive for the small amount that you receive.  The service was a let down. You need to flag them down to get any service or they won't come to you. I think it's because the nature of the restaurant which is mostly for people to chill and relax for hours which is probably why they don't feel the need to check up on their tables that often.    Overall, it's a nice place to chill with a vast amount of food and drink selection, but don't expect the greatest quality when it comes to food or service."}
{"text":"A hot bubble tea is perfect for the current weather. Compared to places in the states or UK this place is so classy and good. HOwever for richmond hill standard and comparison it's just okay."}
{"text":"Feels like the place used to be a lot better. Last time I went the food was really bad. They killed the atmosphere with old loud music. Almost like it's trying to be something it's not. Then I found a fly on my plate."}
{"text":"Wow, another interior design gem in Ontario! But, what else would you expect when it's the sister restaurant to Chako BBQ next door?   Destiny really blew me away with its pristine interior, cozy little pockets of space, long communal tables, trendy couches, beautiful planters, and dark wood throughout. It kind of reminded me of a day-time version of NY's Buddakan.   Although the space is gorgeous, the caliber of food & drink don't seem to measure up. You think if you had such a nice space, you'd let that be an extension of an impressive menu. However, Destiny is more of a place to go to get boba and milk tea drinks. They have a menu that features pictures of sub par food such as a scoop of rice w/ an iceberg lettuce side salad and sweet & sour pork. They also have noodle dishes and sushi, but I can't speak to how any of these tasted since I just had one of their drinks.  So, they have a plethora of drink choices w/ carafes of Destiny Specialty drinks and tall glasses of Iced Oriental Teas, Grapefruit Teas, Slushies, Milkshakes, Yogurt drinks, Fruit Blended drinks and Soda Mixes. I went w/ their Coconut Milkshake and was pretty happy w/ it.  Wi-Fi here is free, which is awesome when you just want to grab a drink and do a little work. Although, I almost felt like I was contributing to the destruction of the ambiance. You look around and ppl are studying there w/ their papers splayed all over the tables, or ppl who are practically horizontal on the couches. It's just kind of weird.   Either way, this place was perfect for what I was looking for: A good drink, Free Wi-Fi and a beautiful space."}
{"text":"Everytime I come here there is something wrong. The food and the drinks are subpar at best. For the distance traveled considering I live downtown, there are plenty of better places to get good bubble tea. It's worth it to go and see and try once  in a while with a group, but otherwise, not worth it."}
{"text":"This was one of the worst restaurant experiences I ever had. Ignored by all servers who never have any smile on their faces. I had to call them to come take my order after waiting 20-30 minutes. Servers are all rude and you won't see them again after they take your order. Even the servers bringing the dishes just drop the plates on your table and leave swiftly without asking if you need anything else. You will never see them again if you need something else. Even the food is very low quality but they will charge you Moxie's price level ($10 for some KFC quality lava cake?). Of course, on their bill, the 15% tip is already included even though they don't deserve any. They don't even ask if you need water or bring it automatically like many other restaurants. Even for the bill, you have to catch the attention of a server. They will all play hide and seek with you as thought it's not their problem. The owner is probably hiring high school kids with no experience but locate the restaurant around some high end restaurants hoping to charge as much for maximum profit. I will never ever set foot in this restaurant again."}
{"text":"worst tea spot in This town, first of all, my bubble tea was overpriced and second of all it was not fresh, third of all, when I went to pay, they would not let more than 4 credit cards to be used in our order. please don't support this sketchy business operation."}
{"text":"I go here all the time. Its a great place to just hang out, play cards and have bubble tea. The atmosphere is really nice and it has a pretty cool design to it too.   They have a wide variety of bubble tea and I haven't ever been disappointed trying new ones. You can get them in teas, milk teas, slushies, milkshakes, hot teas, fresh fruit drinks... My go to drinks are the mango passion fruit fresh fruit bubble tea or, on a cold day, the hot taro tea!   As for the food and service, its really hit or miss. Some days the service is quick and great, others its just the opposite. I really like the sausage and rice with peas, the spring rolls are good and the coconut shrimp as well. Other dishes I've tried were either too saucy, too salty or tasteless.  Verdict: If you're looking for a nice meal, better luck elsewhere! If you're looking to hang out and have bubble tea, this is a great place."}
{"text":"For the price, the drinks can be a bit small. But you know, I didn't care after I got my drink because this is one of the only tea places I've been that uses Osmanthus flower (sweet olive flower) in their bubble tea base.   If you aren't familiar with this flower which can be used to brew tea, you've got to try it. It has a sweet, honey-like smell and a very subtle taste, but it really makes your mango or other fruit teas taste amazing!  Definitely recommend going there and asking for your tea to be made with osmanthus flower. Delicious."}
{"text":"Horrible service, servers don't listen to customers requests. I asked for a soup and asked to replace the noodles with extra veggies. They charged me 3 dollars extra and did not add any veggies"}
{"text":"I came here two days ago. It was around 9pm when we got there. Me, my bestie, and my bestie's mom went. We ordered a ramen, caramel cake, fruity honey brick toast, chrysanthemum tea, and a fruit tea. The fruit tea was absolutely delicious. The chrysanthemum tea was good too. The caramel cake tastes good and wasn't too sweet. I didn't like the brick toast that much. The toast was salty because they used butter and it was also very moist. Similar to a sponge. Like for example it's like how you would soak a liquid in it then it comes out when you squeeze it. It felt like that so I wouldn't get it again! One thing that sucked was that when we asked for an extra cup for the tea they charged us $1!!!! But definitely will come back for the fruit tea!"}
{"text":"Beautiful set up. Yes, it's fancy and cool.   DEstiny started out goood. I mean, really good. Then, it went down. DOWN DOWN DOWN. What happened??   Their service got slow and rude. One staff threw dirty napkins infront of us when he was taking our plates away. It took another staff 15 minutes to bring us spoon.  They're also not very informative on the menu."}
{"text":"Came here after dinner to check out the desserts. The cake slices were HUGE - we had 1 slice of strawberry shortcake, 1 mocha chocolate and 1 chocolate marble chessecake (something like that) - they were all delicious! I recommend sharing one slice among a few people. The cold drinks were ok, def not \"natural\". I liked that they serve tea in a pot with a little candle underneath.   But honestly, when I walked in, I thought this was a club or something. The decor is very nice but not very fitting for the nature of its business. Don't people want a cozier space to hang out and read magazines?"}
{"text":"awesome place for teens and people who just want to drink and talk; service is crappy decor is really nice food is not bad overpriced stuff cakes are always out of stock  ** note that if you go there, always check your forks and spoons because most likely, they're dirty**"}
{"text":"We were seated immediately. Service was quick at first but lagged as the night went on, especially around 10 pm. However, they did not rush us out, rather they allowed us to sit, chat and take our time to catch up with one another.   Prices are fair and there is a good variety of drinks and food to choose from. I like that they have free wifi. Our group paid in cash since their card reader was not working properly. Also they combined our orders into one bill and we had to organize who ordered what so they could split our bills for us.   The atmosphere of the place is comfy, spacious, well lit and tables are large as well.  The drink I chose was the sesame milk iced tea. It was very strong at first sip since most of the sesame flavour settled to the bottom of the glass and I didn't stir it yet at that point. Nevertheless, the taste was pleasant and even the small size was a reasonable quantity.   For dessert I picked the butter coconut toast because I like butter, coconut and toast separately so combined it should be amazing right?!  My intuition was correct. Loved the toast. It was crispy on the edges and gooey in the middle which was a nice textual contrast. The butter sauce on top reminded me of custard Taste wise but thinner in consistency. The bread itself was thick and pillowy when I cut into it. Overall I found the toast to be quite a filling snack/dessert item.  Final verdict: Food/drinks are good. Service is alright but crowds will start forming especially during late night."}
{"text":"Subpar drinks and service that isn't the greatest. Waiters aren't attentive and it can be a mission to wave down one. Also, we ordered a Jamaica Almond Fudge cake and a Nut Buster cake but when it was delivered to us, the staff wasn't knowledgeable about which one was which.  Even after knowing this, I keep coming back time and time again so something must be drawing me back here."}
{"text":"This is a very nice place to chill with friends. I usually go here at night. It has very nice drinks, teas and food as well. The price is fair. I recommend it"}
{"text":"Everything is overpriced and the service is extremely horrible. They take forever to come by to take your order, and it was tough for us to even try to flag someone down.   On top of that they force you to buy something even if you don't want to. Otherwise you have to pay $3 just sit alongside your friends even when the restaurant has hundreds of available seats. I've been to this place a few times before but this time I didn't want anything and just wanted to join my friends. I was with 7 other people who all ordered things that were at least $6-8 each which adds up well above $3 per person for 8 people. The manager who was serving us then told me that I must buy something. However I was not in the mood to get anything at the time and he was still telling me that I have to get something, which then forced my friend to buy something extra so that the server would get off our case.   It made it a very uncomfortable experience for our whole group and I felt bad to make someone else spend more money than they needed to. I also felt very unwelcome, which is the last thing I should feel in a restaurant. I will never be returning even if my friends go again."}
{"text":"If you're feeling young, or love microwaved food and bubble tea, this is the perfect place to chill for you!"}
{"text":"Rude staff, broken machine, missing chopstick for takeouts, average food. Not recommended if I have other options."}
{"text":"Haven't been here since 2013 and I have to say it was quite the disappointment. Ordered the takoyaki and beef slice spicy ramen, both were mediocre.  Portion was decent however and the bubble tea was alright.  Overall would not recommend."}
{"text":"Great place to grab a meal, have a drink. Price is reasonable, very casual, servers are attentive. Food is alright - nothing outstanding."}
{"text":"Never again.  This place was good when it first opened years ago.   We came here again for lunch today. Bubble tea was not good.  Food was not good at all. Ordered a noodle dish and the noodles were soft and soggy like it was sitting in a pot of water for hours and hours  Server was horrible. He forgot almost everything and never ever once stopped when we called him over. He would do this continue to walk past us while we were talking and he had to turn our heads and continue to tell him what we wanted because he never stopped at our table. His replies were rude, \"what do you want\", \"coming\""}
{"text":"Went here for deserts after dinner and drinks with a couple of friends, first of all this isn't really a place that would be good late night because they were closing the booths around 12. The waitress was not too fond of us asking questions about the cakes available, she got frustrated and started pointing at the menu. The bailey's cheese cake was absolutely tasteless, honey dew with milk is their specialty which was fine, but it seems they had ran out of actual cups, and served us with plastic ones instead, guess we don't need to worry about the environment anymore because everything can be recycled these days, or can it? Furthermore don't let the decor fool you, the soap in the washroom doesn't work, the faucets are poorly designed causing water to spill everywhere except the drain. When you sit on the couches you feel a couple inches shorter, and you would probably need a friend to help you up. This was my second time going here and I think the quality has lowered drastically."}
{"text":"I don't care how good the food is here if there's ZERO customer service, I'm never coming back.  The owner is this place is so rude, it's disgusting. The owner discriminates against her own customers over seatings.  I didn't realize how bad this place was until I'm writing this and reading what others had to say about this place.  I had to move my seats FOUR times today to try to find a spot to study/eat- owner refused to let me sit in the back part of the restaurant for whatever reasons.  Walking in I told the owner lady that I wanted a relatively quiet place to do work and she gave me a seat facing the window which was fine up until a crowd of 12 people showed up and were super loud.  I asked if I could sit in the opposite section of the restaurant and she said it was closed off along with the back side of the current section.  I moved to a spot but later saw that the back section had people sitting there and I moved there cause it was remote, quiet and bright.  Lady came by again and told me that she already told me I couldn't be here and when I questioned her about the other people sitting there she said it was her daughter (there was a Caucasian woman there and I'm sure it wasn't her daughter).  In any case, this is the way this place treats their paying customers.  Rude!!  I can't see what's the big deal with me sitting in the back area other than they can't wipe down the table??!!!!  This is just plain discrimination.  As I mentioned before, ZERO customer service.  Other than taking my drinks and bowl away, no one came by to ask to see how things are going, whether or not I needed anything else, or give me the bill to pay!  I had to wave the waiter down or go up to the counter to pay and ask for stuff each time.    Things are overpriced here but I figured since I was planning on sitting here for most of Sunday afternoon, I didn't mind the cost.    I was looking forward to this place as my go-to place to study/eat but they just lost another customer cause I'm never coming back again.  There are so many other good places in the area for bubble tea/Chinese food that they'll need to do better to stay in the competition.  I wouldn't be surprised if this place goes out of business in the future with the way they treat their patrons."}
{"text":"Atmosphere: Very nice modern interior design.  Service: REALLY BAD. SLOW. Waiters/Waitresses will NEVER check up on you. You can't even flag them down.   Food: Average. Two of the three dishes I've had here were really greasy. Their bubble tea is probably the only thing I would ever have here.  Try out if you really want to. But as for service and food. Not recommended."}
{"text":"Awful service, rude and confused manager, terrible coffee and hot Dark chocolate. They didn't serve all the orders at the same time, after 10 min. somebody came to get the orders, We ordered, 2 specialty coffees, one hot dark chocolate one cold drink, one crepe and one cheese cake + a glass of water for myself.....I was so thirsty. After 10 min. he brought a hot chocolate first which didn't look like a \"Hot Dark Chocolate\" it was like and taste like a hot brownish color milk!! Awful taste...... After 10 min. someone else brought something by mistake which it wasn't one of our order, so we returned it.......... After 10 min. I told the servant \"don't bring the order one by one, bring everything at the same time\", he said, \"you should have told me first\", I said, \"I am telling you now, this hot chocolate is awful and its cold\"...... he took the hot chocolate and gone........... After 5 min. they brought 2 \"specialty coffee\" but they were not Specialty at all, taste like crap!!.......... again not all the orders at the same! After 5 min. he brought the crepe & the cheese cake at the same time! HEEEY.........I know he tried so hard!! Then I told him \"I asked you to bring a glass of water too\", he said \"Sorry, I will\" After 5 min. he brought the replaced \"Hot Dark chocolate\" which was totally different from the first one..........  We almost finished the crepe and the cheese cake but so far no water and there was one cold drink left............. Then I told him \"where is my drink and water?\" He said \"which drink?\" I brought all of your order, then we realized he didn't write it down....! OMG He said \"what was the drink?\", I said forget about it we are almost done. You provide a terrible service and we want to leave just bring the bill and a glass of water........... After 10 min. still NO WATER!!!!, I was so thirsty then I asked another waitress to call her manager and bring me a glass of water, she said actually that guy is the manager.......!!! OMG, I felt so hopeless......... I asked her \"please bring the bill & a glass of water, we don't want to stay here longer\" . . . . . . BTW, I finally got a glass of water.............HEEEEEY"}
{"text":"This is usually the hang out place after dinner or when there are friends from out of town.  The bubble tea is very expensive.  It is the atmosphere that counts.  Most of the customers are in the 20's or 30's that don't care about the price.  They can sit there for hours playing card, tablet, laptop or smart phone.  The waiter/waitress is polite.  Remember to call them when they pass by, otherwise you may have to wait a long time.  The ice dessert is good.  The cake, however, is so so.   Don't rate the food as it is a hang out place."}
{"text":"I have been here once before a few years ago but don't recall such atrocious service before. I came here recently again and was so disappointed as it wasn't as I remember it to be. We were greeted at the front and was brought to our table. The seats were incredibly uncomfortable, imagine sitting on a plank of wood that was exactly what it was like. When we were seated, we had to wait for at least 20 minutes but not once had someone come by our table during that time. Every single time I tried to get the attention of someone, they would avoid eye contact and just keep on walking pass. The food and drinks although good, was overpriced for the proportion. There was a lack of waiting staff and it was difficult to identify who was even working there as they all wore something different. One waiter was even wearing a winter jacket while on his shift. I will not be returning again and will be taking my money elsewhere."}
{"text":"This place is starting to go downhill.   Their building maintenance sucks, how long did it take to fix that front entrance. Months?  Sat in a room at the far end one time, dead flies all on the ceiling cloth. The sofas, I don't know if they have ever been cleaned. Lots of drink stains.   This place need a bottom to top refresh.  Tea is the same (it's a powder drink) so that's consistant, food is pretty much the same, the crepes vary depending on who's working.  Still an okay hangout but hopefully they get better."}
{"text":"They did not have half of what they had in the menu. The prices were over rated. I ordered hot chocolate which was 5.69 something and pretty much tasted like water. Very bad service due to poor English. The destiny in silver star blvd is much better and great service and people were really friendly and food was great. I recommend don't give a chance to this place."}
{"text":"I used to come to this place almost 3-4 times a week every summer for years, the service was OK and the food was good. Since the renovations this past summer, they increased their prices again to obscene numbers. I went with a group of 7 where we were put onto a small table. I tried the rice bowl with Taiwanese sausage, which is almost always good no matter where you go and was a safe choice before their renovations... Or so I thought. Besides the bowl being very small, it was mainly rice with only 6 thin slices of the sausage. Let's just say it wasn't worth $11. My companions were less than impressed with their meals which cost $3 more but was the same size.  The service from the staff was pretty good and they walked by fairly often to make sure we had everything we needed.  Once we decided to leave, they said we could only have a max of 4 separate bills (should have known this was still their policy since it was before the renovations). We figured out who would pay for who, some needing to pay by card while others had cash. When we went up to go pay we were then told they do not accept any card and there was an ATM behind us. A little bit shocking considering they have meal dishes that cost $75.99.  Maybe I'm just more baffled because I knew how it was before where the meal sizes were decent, prices fair, and they accepted card.. But I don't think I will ever come back or recommend this location"}
{"text":"Destiney's Richmond Hill   I called the restaurant at 12:59am, screenshot attached for proof, I spoke to the manager and asked him what time they close.  He said they close at 2am, last call at 1:30am, I asked him if as long as I arrive there before 1:30am then it's ok? He said yes.  I rushed and I arrived there at 1:25am with a friend of mine, the same manager I spoke to on the phone was there at the front and he asked the lady to seat us, she seated us and in a rude way she said it's last call now and we would have to place the order right now, we ordered 2 waffles with ice cream for dining in, and 2 food items for takeout.  She went to the kitchen and came back to us and said, they won't able to serve waffles now because they already turned off the waffle machines 20 mins. ago and it would take 20 minutes to warm it up again.  So I said to her, basically they turned off the waffle machines at 1:05am which is way too early, they should have at least turned it off at 1:30am if there were no more orders, because the restaurant advises people that last call is 1:30am NOT 1:00am! I also advised her that I called before I came in and spoke to the manager and he told me that as long as I'm there before 1:30am then it would be fine.  She apologized and said sorry and again she said they can't turn it back on now because if they do it would take 20 minutes until it's warmed up.   Finally, I asked to speak to the manager, the manager at the front came over and I explained to him that I am very upset and that as soon as I go home I will post my complaint review on Yelp, Google Places, Trip Advisor and many other internet blogs, and will also be writing a letter to the head office of Destiney's about this complaint in accordance with the laws and  freedom of speech, when he heard that he started apologizing and said that's fine have a seat and we will do it for you, I said No thanks, I don't trust the kitchen staff, because now after I complained to him they might spit or do something to the food, then I left.   I can understand that the staff can't wait to go home, but if their policy says that the last call is at 1:30am and that's what they advised me and advise other customers then they should abide by it, if the staff get lazy and decide to turn off the machines earlier than the promised time then perhaps they shouldn't be working there, and the same goes with the manager because he shouldn't be allowing his staff to do this.   I posted the same complaint on several internet review sites"}
{"text":"I enjoy the food hete as well as their wide variety of drinks. This restaurant falls behind in one aspect! Awkward service, not consistent. Still suggest going for a late night snack or mid day bubble tea."}
{"text":"Oh Destiny... the headquarters of Asians in the 905 area. I only come here when I feel like getting bubble tea on a hot summer's night and it's already past 11 or to get back to my Asian roots. While I do make the drive from downtown Toronto, it's usually with friends when we have absolutely nothing else to do.   The bubble tea here is alright, nothing special. Portions are smaller than you'd expect for the price. It's better than gofortea, but doesn't compare to tenrens. They sometimes run out of tapioca on busy nights (weekends) which kind of sucks cause I don't like getting jelly in my drinks.  I wouldn't get the food here, everything I've tried has been mediocre at best.  The smoked salmon salad is gross skip that at all costs. Something else to consider before ordering is anything with fried chicken. Their fried chicken is soaked in a MSG batter, so much that it will linger in your mouth long after you've left.  This place is loud during the evening's. A lot of asians playing cards and fob's screaming about random shit. So be prepared to enter a screaming match with the group of asian girls sitting next to you. Long story short, if you want bubble tea late at night go here, if not then don't bother coming."}
{"text":"Terrible. There's a reason why they closed down twice. Service is slow AF. Waitress didn't even understand \"milk black tea\" and needed us to point it out in the menu. Took over an hour for our food and drinks to come only to discover the strawberry milk tea tastes like Pepto Bismol tablets dissolved in water. Milk black tea is literally water and milk. I would review the lychee green tea but it still hasn't come yet. On the bright side, the interior looks great!"}
{"text":"In 905 land, there are limited options for entertainment. Don't be offended if you are a 905er. You know it's true. That's why they call it the suburbs.  Anyways, bubble tea is always a great choice for a relaxing evening.  Destiny has things that you find at most other bubble tea places. 1) Crappy service. 2) Loud music. 3) Young kids that can't get into bars. 4) Girls desperately seeking attention dressed way too sexy for tea  5) Horrific food. 6) Bubble tea.  This place has nice decor and it's huge. They don't have an extensive list of  flavors of bubble tea...  If you want cherry or blueberry, they don't have them.  The drinks here don't suck, which is great considering it's a tea house.  I was happy with my apple green tea with grape jelly. Popcorn chicken was over-salted and disgusting.  Between this bubble tea joint and Go For Tea nearby, I prefer this one because of the parking.  I got a new car and chose the parking lot where it was less likely to be hit. Parked next to a Bentley convertible and a Mercedes, I felt at ease enjoying my tea."}
{"text":"I feel like some of the reviews on Destiny are a little harsh.   Either that, or I just went on a good night!  I JUST came back from Destiny. Went on a Friday night, 8:30pm-ish. Wasn't as packed as I expected, it was just the parking that was difficult. Ending up parking behind the actual building. I assume parking was packed not only because of Destiny, but both The Keg and Chako next door.   I went with a group of six. Got seated right away in a nice booth. I ordered a pork cutlet on rice. Rice could've been better, salad was ... Well, salad. Pork cutlet was just below food court quality, drizzled with A1 steak sauce. (forgot to take a pic of it! oops!) Drowned down some coconut milkshake, was a little too sweet, but the flavor was good for powders I guess. Obviously not the best bubble tea I've had, but good enough.  Got the nut buster as dessert, and my boyfriend and I loved it!  Service really is what you expect in an Asian restaurant, so I guess it wasn't as irritating for me. Just used to that kind of service.   Decor was nice as everyone stated. Its seriously border line nightclub.   In all honesty, you come here for the company you bring. Its just a nice, semi fancy place for hang outs. I feel people expect a lot from it.  Though, I would choose Destiny over Go For Tea any day!"}
{"text":"My first time here was a decent experience. I enjoyed my strawberry milk with tapioca and the teriyaki squid. The environment is also very cozy. If you like to study at cafes and is in the Richmond Hill area, come here."}
{"text":"This is more of a hang out/bubble tea place than anything. I tried the food and it ranges from decent to outright terrible (never get the ramen, one of the worst dishes I've ever tried at a restaurant). Stick to Chinese dishes, they're much better than other cuisines there. Bubble tea is decent, pretty big selection. They have a lot of space so you can bring board games and it's a good place to go as a big group. It's a bit of a nostalgic place because few years ago there weren't as many bbt places and everyone always went to destiny."}
{"text":"Every time I enter a bubble tea shop/cafe, it seems I have entered a different realm, where the expectation for service literally does not apply.  I've visited this particular location about half a dozen times in the past year, unwillingly. I don't like bubble tea, I just don't get it. Powdered drinks with giant caviar looking things that shares the same texture as tadpoles. What is Tapioca anyway?  I thought after a few visits, perhaps I would grow fond of this place. The food here isn't all that bad, and the individual snacking dishes are actually cooked to a tolerable degree. I always get the popcorn chicken, as I do at the other Destiny on Silver Star Blvd. I always thought the other one had better décor, in the past, and even now with it's facelift.  Here is my beef with ALL bubble tea shops. No servers here will ever, EVER speak to you more than they necessarily need to. They'll bring you your food, and bring your bill. If you don't know them personally, forget about asking for recommendations, or small talk. For some people that's fine, but if you work in an environment that is trying to suggest harmony, and warmth..I expect to be greeted a bit more. But I'm just one Man, and this supposedly is the unspoken rule of remaining unspoken.   I always request where to be seated exactly, and the staff here has never had a problem with it. The place is clean, and it offers WIFI. Many people come here, order under $10 and stay for a very long time.  But the service here is as one would expect from any bubble tea shop, nonchalant at best. You got all these trendy looking servers, earring flopping all over the place, tattoos hanging out, hair that would make Adam Lambert look like Harry Potter.  Buddy handed my friend his drink like he was tossing a shot across a bar, it spilled a little. I was going to protest, but my friend begged me not to. His food never came either, so it was only myself that ate the entrée. We ordered the same thing!! This is a different kind of institution, apparently, I just don't have a system where I can judge bubble tea shops.   Silly Raymond, bbt's for kids."}
{"text":"Nice place for food and hanging out. We had the crazy fried calamari, beef and garlic fried rice and mango smoothie slush with tapioca. The food and drink was yummy and the price was reasonable (I felt the drinks was a little overpriced). Service was good  (little slow but friendly + informative)."}
{"text":"I'm really split with this place. I love that you have your own little booths and the food here is yummy. But the service is unbelievable bad! Me and 5 other friends were sat for 30 minutes before we got mad and asked for somebody to serve us! Even now I'm writing this we finished eating over a hour ago and no one has come to collect our plates. So bad!   When just receiving the bill they already added a 15% tip for themselves. Maybe that's why the service is so bad, because they know they are gonna get tipped anyway. Defiantly put me off coming here again!"}
{"text":"When most people go to bars and get drunk on a weekend... Me and my crew get wasted on Bubble Tea - And we have no problems driving home!  Out of all the bubble tea places in the Markham/Richmond Hill area, Destiny's ismy most frequent and reliable choice to hang out with friends since high school. It's a good place if we want to just sit, drink and have a laugh without being bothered... and don't really care what we eat - as long as it's decent.   The space is huge! Tons of seating on the main level, the loft level and an outdoor patio on nice days/nights. Modern decor, looks like a lounge/club. Mixed seating types - booths or open seating so there's a bit of privacy.  The mood is totally different depending on which group of friends I go with... Midday Crew - during weekends around 1 or 2pm is usually empty with tons of parking and we stay till 6pm then when more people start to trickle in and it's our cue leave. (Past) Curfew Crew - after 9pm Friday or Saturday... harder to find parking, a lot busier and louder, but you are seated almost immediately. This is when we bust out the cards for a few games to see who will end up paying for everything.  Food is decent, nothing spectacular. The cakes are all store bought from La Rocca, but the simplest Toast with condensed milk is pretty good (you can easily make this at home and still taste the same... or even better - but I'd rather have someone else make it). Some of our usual orders: - popcorn chicken - squid balls - beef brisket noodles soup - fried rice - garlic beef  Drinks... tons to choose from.  Mango mix and the orange lemon (hot or cold) are my usuals.  Service has always been the same, bit of smiles, quick to order and pay. The lady usually gives us the bill halfway thru our 'afternoon', I think it's cuz of their shift change, but we stay another hour or two. They have their off days - slow service, run out of mugs (they then use take away cups) or running out of lettuce?! (that was a one-off)... but nothing too crazy.  3.5 stars... for the ok food and drinks... It's really about the company you are with that makes your stay enjoyable. Note: Richmond Hill location takes credit card (not sure about debit).  Scarborough location is cash only but there's an ATM at the entry)"}
{"text":"Came in on a sunday night with a group of 12. Our server's English was not on par he got half our orders wrong. It was a total disaster. The place was really understaffed. To top things off the prices have increased significantly. Service level has gone downhill year over year. Will not be coming back."}
{"text":"This should be a 0/5. We had a big party of around 10 and they seated up on this secluded dark table upstairs with no other customers nearby when there was a more lighted up section beside it. The drinks were expensive, everything was over 4.95. The orders were all in take out cups ONLY, my friend couldn't even recognize her order because it looked so different compared to the picture in the menu, and my other friend got the wrong order...apparently sugar cane milk tea sounds like green apple green tea. There was no service besides giving us our drinks whatsoever. When we went down to pay, I luckily saw that 15 percent tips was already included. So I paid 6.45 for a small hot taro milk tea which tasted mediocre and for nonexistent service. My friends weren't told about the included tips so they ended up paying 30% tips...So like 9 dollars for a large bubble tea?...My friends said their drinks tasted horrible too, mostly overly sweet..."}
{"text":"This place SUCKS.  1. The roof was leaking water everywhere and there were buckets placed around the place to collect ceiling leaks  2. They ran out of glasses and our orders came in plastic cups and didn't look anything like the pictures on the menu, and the \"large\" size was just a regular small plastic cup. Then our friend who showed up later ordered a large too, but he got the actual glass which looked way bigger. Then the waiter assured us that the to-go cup had the same amount than the tall glass... Which either way is not a good thing, because that just means that the design of the glass makes you think you're getting a lot when you're actually getting a very small amount.  3. The strawberry ice cream with chocolate crepe crisps is overpriced and lame. The amount was small, the taste was mediocre, and it was like $9!  4. The almond cake was dry and disappointing  5. The caramel milkshake tasted like coconut, and it was completely white. I honestly think they messed up the order and made a coconut shake by accident, and then just threw some caramel flavored syrup to mask the flavor. Either that or they ran out of caramel or vanilla ice cream and replaced it with coconut. They didn't even tell us, but what if we were allergic to coconut?  6. This place is always crowded, and service WILL be slow. At least our server was very friendly, but she was super busy. Not her fault, I think they're understaffed."}
{"text":"Second / Updated Review: Probably my 10th time going to Destiny in the last 6-7 years, and now I just find more and more things to flag. My group ordered Green Tea which came in a little pot and 1 (really) tiny cup. We asked for 2 more cups, and the waiter said each cup would cost $1.....SUPER annoying and shocking, because the amount of tea wasnt being changed...we had only asked for 2 more cups to share the tea pot instead of 1. Food is still good tasting and probably the only thing that makes me come back when I can't find something else in the area.  The same dude who wears purple cleaning gloves to clean tables, is STILL doing the same thing. Cleans tables, and using the same gloves is serving food to patrons. Someone really needs to flag this or report to York Region Public Health.  Otherwise, food is still tasty, priced well. The $1 per tea cup is rather confusing and almost enraging, and the infamous purple glove guy needs to go."}
{"text":"I used to love coming to destiny's for late night eats and hangs with friends. But haven't been back since they changed their menu. I find that the quality of their food downgraded. It's gotten more expensive for less. I've had a lot of up and down experiences with this restaurant. There are times when it was good and times where it was beyond horrible. The employees don't seem to care too much, sometimes you wait around for hours and service is horrendous. It's such a shame because I used to really enjoy coming here."}
{"text":"Service is a bit slow and the drinks and food choices are satisfactory. The atmosphere seems a little aged to be a modern hang out place. It's still a good place to hang out with friends and play some card games. The staff don't seem to bother you for ordering a few drinks and staying for hours. There is fee wifi so I guess they do encourage you to stay awhile."}
{"text":"Had to pay a dollar for an extra cup...Yeah, and tea is tasteless. Orange mango does not have any mango taste."}
{"text":"Comida muy costosa y sin variedad, se tardan mucho hasta para sacar las bebidas, la calidad de las comidas no tienen sabor. Calidad relacion precio es demasiado costosa para lo que le ofrecen al cliente."}
{"text":"I have never in my long life written a review for anything, but this restaurant is so bad that it provokes me to warn the rest of the world of its greed and bad manners. There were about 16 of us that came one night for dinner. we ordered and everything was fine, until the food came. The server dropped the very hot noodle soup on the table (accident), and it spilled on 4 people, they were wet from top to bottom, and they were all burned. The server said with an insincere tone that he was sorry, didn't ask if we were okay, and what they can do for us, not even take our their first aid. we all sat there not knowing what to do, and they didn't give any instruction as to move to another table, but just left to get napkins (to clean up a table of mess). eventually we decided to move to another table ourselves, and we took all of our spoons, forks, and all our food ourselves to the other table. and that's it, never see them again. Didn't come up again to see how we were, or if the people that were burned were okay. We are all generous tippers since we know that being a waiter is hard, but we decided to not tip on this meal since their customer service was terrible. Then the war begins..... so I went up and told the manager that we would like to not pay for the tip since they dropped a bowl of bomb on us and did not felt their apology was sincere, and their customer service was nonexistent. So they said that they could not remove the 12% tip. So i said that, let's just take off 20 dollars from the bill if they can't work out the machine to remove the tip, we had 16 people, so 20$ would have been 10% or so. then they \"angrily\" said that they take take off 2%!, but they were angry and had a threatening tone, seriously threatening! and I said no, I would not like to pay any tips at all, not only did they not provide any customer service, but they make it seem like its our fault, and got angry at us, and make us feel threatened. So we said we would like to give no tip, and then the manager angrily said \" you just dont want to give tip right? just say that in the first place\" (which I did, but he just didn't hear i guess). and then they THREW the bill at us and yelled out, PAY THE MONEY. and then we did, we pay the bill, without the tip. and as we walk back to our table, they became monsters.... they YELLED out loud at us, and the manager came and kicked their own chairs in front of all of us, including kids! and they asked us to leave and pointed to the door, and we left, and as we were walking out, we can hear them yell at us in another language (cantonese). and as we walked out, the manager followed us, and all of us were scared, and they said to us with a threatening tone, who got burned? I want to know, but at this point we were all upset, and just told them to stop, stop being so rude and bad mannered. I  In summary, it was the worst experience I've had in my many years of life. It seems that these employees are all teenagers who don't really have much manner and respect for people, and are there solely for the paycheck and do not regard people's experience. It seems that all the employees are referred in by their friends and did not receive any proper training on customer service or manner, or courteous, or respect, or any form of kind behaviour. the restaurant was quite empty for a saturday night, it seems that i'm not the only one who had a terrible experience, and hence their business is dying. I hope to get in contact with the owner, the manager was the worst of all the employees, and hope to suggest a few tips on hiring. if you are looking for a place to dine, or drink bubble tea, or do anything, I would not suggest this place."}
{"text":"Destiny is one of the hot spots for young bubble tea fanatics. While few would argue that it has some of the best bubble tea in the city, many would agree that it has a great atmosphere, conducive for hanging out with friends. Its bubble tea is just OK."}
{"text":"Have been here many times in the past and always had a good experience. However, it seems they have made some changes to their policy (i.e. minimum of 1 order per person). The place was empty last night at 12:00 AM, I think they could have put this policy in place during peak time hours, or if they have such policy at least they can say it in a professional manner rather than the host saying this in a condescending manner. The host was extremely unprofessional and had an unwelcoming attitude. The quality of the drinks were definitely lower than before, I ordered the Kiwi Juice and it was watered down."}
{"text":"Overall good! I'd give a 3 and a half star if I could. The ambiance is really nice; very classy and all the food comes out visually appealing (fancy shaped glasses, rice pyramids, etc.) I see a lot of people complaining about the service being slow, but it was actually fairly quick when I went. The reason it doesn't get a four star though is because the food in general isn't very extraordinary. It's certainly good, the squid appetizer was actually amazing, but their beef noodle soup, and fried rice was just ok. Their signature tea was also good, but it was definitely on the small side for being $5-$6."}
{"text":"I like their brick toast with condensed milk. Their waffles aren't bad either. Loaded with lots and lots of whipped cream.  Their large size bubble teas are pretty massive. I prefer their fruit drinks rather than the bbt. I've tried kiwi and pineapple before. Yum!  Service isn't the greatest. But I can understand considering how busy it can get. This place got even busier after go for tea closed down a couple blocks down.  Good luck finding parking!"}
{"text":"When here to go get some lychee soda with bubble bubble kinda disappointed in their services took literally 30 minutes to get to drinks as well as people that came after us got their food and drink before us which was kinda upsetting.  Overall the drink was decent but the service was terrible."}
{"text":"This place is a decent bubble tea shop to hang out with some friends and just relax.  The drinks are decent for the price and the snacks are also not bad.  My favourite has to be the popcorn chicken and taro milk shake.  Overall the atmosphere is nice and when the patio is open it's a great place to relax.  The service is sub par if you can even find a server, but the food and drinks come out mega quick."}
{"text":"-- My First Impression --  I used to visit this Destiny more frequently when I was in school. They had free wifi and I could sit there the whole day to work on my assignments and get caught up on my studies. Not too much has changed since then, their staff aren't attentive at all because they are always chit-chatting with themselves instead of working. During my latest visit, I was here on a weekday afternoon and there were not a lot of customers here. I told the server we were a party of 2 and he brought us to a table. My husband asked whether we could sit in the upper level. The server seemed shocked and asked why we wanted to sit there. I was quite surprised. Since there were only 5-8 guests in such a large restaurant, did it matter where we wanted to be seated?  (When there were only 2 groups of customers sitting in the upper level)  -- Food and Drink --   1. Minced Pork and Sausage Fried Rice - a mediocre Chinese style fried rice. Large portion size and the price reflected it.   2. Large Strawberry Black Tea with Tapioca - My husband loved their strawberry black tea a lot. It wasn't too sweet and tapioca texture was above average.   3. Large White Peach Black Tea with Green Apple Jelly - I liked this white peach black tea very much. The tea taste was mild. I found the green apple jelly very hard and it caused me to have a stomachache afterwards.   -- Overall --  I found this place over priced and the servers weren't friendly at all. Originally, we were here for their grapefruit fruit tea (there was actual grapefruit pieces in it). After they changed their menu and the prices, they removed all grapefruit drinks. Now that the new Go For Tea is opened next to where I live, I don't think I will come back to this branch anymore."}
{"text":"The place is chic and makes the best drinks in the area. All kinds of bubble tea and slushies that not only taste good but look good. There is also a large selection of food from noodles, rice, hot pots etc.  Great place for a date or a conversation ."}
{"text":"I haven't been here for over a year and they've really changed the place. Unfortunately, I feel like the service has gone down. The food is about the same but the decor/renovations are quite nice.  Our server was in training, being accompanied by their trainer. While ordering, my friend ordered coconut jelly, to which I asked if they even had coconut jelly because it wasn't on the menu. The two servers said yes so we continued ordering. We got the matcha red bean slush, passion fruit tea, green apple tea with lychee, popcorn chicken, and strawberry shortcake. The server in training made sure to repeat the order to confirm it was correct. 15 minutes later, a third server came and told us we didn't have coconut jelly, so the order was changed to lychee jelly, which was okay but I wish they told us earlier when we first asked. Shortly after, a fourth server told us the strawberry shortcake was sold out, so we changed that to the truffle royale cake. After about 30 mins, a fifth server brought our drinks, except they were the wrong drinks. When they brought the correct drinks and food, they didn't give us any utensils to eat them, which took another 10 minutes or so. The time they took wasn't too much of a big deal for us since we were just drinking our drinks and playing some board games, but the service was quite lacking.  The food itself was very average. If you've been to this type of Asian dessert and food place before, then you've probably eaten these. The drinks were all pretty standard, nothing special, and slightly overpriced. The popcorn chicken was seasoned nicely and was crunchy. They weren't particularly hot, just warm. The truffle royale cake tastes exactly like the Costco black & white cake--which is very chocolatey, sugary, and rich.  I would probably only come here if it was the only one around at the time. The service was just all over the place, but the food itself was fine. We weren't particularly eager to get our food quick, since we were just planning to lounge around and play some games for a few hours. Don't come here if you're looking for quick service."}
{"text":"Took over 40 mintues to get our food. The food didnt come out around the same time. We didn't receive enough utensils for our table. No water was offerred or provided. We asked three different servers for water before we got anything. Two of my peers received their bubble teas before we got our water...even then they managed to get our bubble tea order wrong  We ordered kimchi fried rice and beef fried rice which was mediocre at best. Their waffles are good.   I would not come back to this location. Especially not for water."}
{"text":"Destiny is a really good choice when you like to spend a few hours with a group of people. There are a lot of seats available and the service is pretty good. The menu also has a very wide range of items which allows for everyone to get what they desire."}
{"text":"I have been here a few times and have to say the drinks and food are delicious.  I went with a bunch of friends who each had two bubble teas each.  All I can say is, \"They were heavenly\".  When I went there last time we had a steak dish of some sort (which was amazing) a seafood soup (which was delicious), a taroccino (which was amazing hot... wow) and some other things.  I would definitely go back.  The attire is dressy or casual and the ambiance is nice.  It's a good place to relax with friends."}
{"text":"Always drove by this place in east beaver creek and finally paid a visit  They have really good drinks !!!  We ordered the strawberry slush drink and taro slush drink and both were really good! The strawberry one had a really big strawberry flavour maybe a little too sweet.  I preferred the taro drink to be a little sweeter and I asked for sweetener and added it, it was perfect.  Onion rings and fries were basic nothing out of the world and they were a good sharing size   We paid $1 to upsize our drinks and it's worth it. The service was good got everything we needed and was checked up on  They have really appealing desserts aswell.  The place is really big very high ceiling and overall big area  Good experience. Also free wifi (no password)"}
{"text":"This location is great for hangouts because it is spacious and has confortable seating. Music isn't too loud and environment is decently clean. Servers are friendly and check up on you regularly. I have been to this location many times but only for the hangout. I do have to admit that they have improved their meals from being super salty to a decent amount of saltiness. Unfortunately this place is last on my list for drinks. I have tried all sorts of different drinks each time and 5th try is strike. If you want to hang out over drinks then I would recommend elsewhere. Other than that I guess they have good cake (sometimes its stale)."}
{"text":"Man, it's gotten so shitty over the years, that I don't even want to go here anymore.   Came here quite late in the evening after an activity, as we just wanted a quick drink. Came in and ended up waiting for a couple minutes before we got a table. The host didn't actually see us, but another server did, and pretty much just ignored us, and didn't even tell the other host we were waiting.   When we got a table, once again it took forever to get the attention of a server to put our order in. Drinks are okay, but nothing special or worth mentioning.   As we were sitting, the server just brought over our bill without us asking for it. Not something I like as it feels the server is subtly asking you to leave.   Overall, don't like the way this place has turned out over the years. There are tons of other bubble tea places in the vicinity, which I urge you to go to instead. Just full of rude kids working who don't care."}
{"text":"Been coming here for years to hangout and play board games. Prices are above average but that is okay cause you can sit for hours. The hot food is bout 2.5/5. Its really nothing special. The desert is much better overall. The teas, slush etc are all pretty standard. Great place to have a drink and just chill."}
{"text":"Be still my heart. Destiny has taken my breath away with its beauty and has won me over with their early evening special.   On weekdays from 5:30 - 8:30pm, there's a $7.95 special - approximately 10 entree items to choose from and this great deal INCLUDES milk tea or green tea. What a steal! Regularly the items are priced between $6.99 to $8.99 and tea prices starts from $3.99. Entrees include Cantonese chow mein, rice with eggplant & minced pork, tom yum seafood soup, pork cutlet ramen soup, and more.   Alluring interior design, modest costs and convenience - there's free wi-fi, but not available on weekends and stat holidays (as it's too busy to accommodate demand). Though I still feel Destiny is in my cards as a regular uptown hangout.   How I've turned my back on bubble tea for so long, but now I'm back baby! And with a vengeance! No matter how far you are, I will drive the distance for you and I'll return sooner than you think...   However, I can't help but feel you're holding back and the best is yet to come. And for that, you're a 4 star for now. But I can't wait to see what the future holds... Destiny you have made me a happy girl! And I WANT YOU RIGHT NOW!"}
{"text":"I tried.  I really tried to like this place because I thought to myself that this location must be better than the other Silver Star location http://www.yelp.ca/biz/destiny-tea-cafe-scarborough#hrid:t6HNvViqfKG69W_ikjUIRg because they must have learned from each other's mistakes.... but, alas, my hopes were in vain.    Once again, I went with a large group and were seated on the second floor.  The company was superb, but the drinks...?  I got the hot almond tea in a paper cup and it both smelled and tasted off.  Others who asked for bubbletea were served in plastic cups.  Rumour (completely unverified, but I think the source is trustworthy...) has it that only second floor visitors get plastic and paper cups because they're less heavy for potentially clumsy servers to bring up.  Really?  I had the misfortune to be hungry and ordered the 'pad thai' which was really seafood and chicken ho fun (thick rice noodle) with a bit of hot pepper.  The dish wasn't entirely bad, and would have tasted great from a food court when labelled as such.  On some positive notes, the decor was nice and the servers were professional and prompt.  Funny aside -  a fellow in a table behind us sat down and broke his chair.  Entirely.  It was like a scene scripted from a comedy from his stunned expression to everyone else trying not to laugh.  This would be a good place to hang out for non-alcoholic drinks with friends on a late night.  Great for large groups, and it's clean.  I'd stay away from the food though and think about the plenitude of other similar bubbletea houses in the area."}
{"text":"After a heavy dinner, two of my friends wanted to go to destiny for bubble tea. We waited at The front for 30 minutes before we were seated. Not one apology for the wait. We were finally seated, ordered two bubble teas and asked for the bill when the waiter said we would have to each order an item or else we would be charged a fee for not ordering. SHE NOR ANYONE ELSE TOLD US ABOUT THIS FEE BEFORE WE SAT. none of my three friends wanted anything, so we talked to management about this in which they replied \"JUST ORDER THREE MORE ITEMS!!!\". we were so full from our previous meal and absolutely did not want anything else to eat. We eventually settled on buying three more items we clearly did not want but had to because of their ridiculous store policy. After ordering we ask for a split bill in which she replies \"we have to charge a 15% premium for separate bills\". ARE YOU KIDDING ME? WE JUST SPENT ANOTHER 30 DOLLARS ON ITEMS THAT WE DID.NOT WANT.IN THE FIRST PLACE, AND YOUR CHARGING FOR SEPARATE BILLS????. we spoke with the store owner who said the same thing the employee said. I hate this place with a passion; would                not recommend this to ANYONE.  WORST FOOD AND WORST SERVICE EVER PERIOD. Would give 0 stars if possible. I MADE A YELP ACCOUNT JUST FOR THIS REVIEW"}
{"text":"Unlike everyone else, I ended up here at around 2:30 am, catching up with an old friend.  With no Karaoke places available, and alcohol not really on our minds, we hunkered down for some sweet drinks.  The selection is large, and we only could try a couple.  They were very sweet, and not particularly \"natural\" in flavour... still Lychee-ish foodstuffs are still tasty, authenticity aside.  The space is very modern and quite attractive, actually.  I like the decor quite a bit, with warm yellow lantern styled lighting and very ultramodern yet eastern styling.  The gray couches are an interesting colour choice; the fabric wasn't holding up well from the frequent spills.  Discoloured and tired, the couches really took the interior design down a notch or three.  Still, with free wi-fi tonnes of magazines and sparkling decor (aside from the couches) it makes for a great place to relax whilst reading or chatting."}
{"text":"This place is HUGE!!!!!!!!!!!  Good for big parties and family gatherings.  Wait did I mention its a boba place.  I figure their food will be only \"okay\" but its actually really good surprisingly.  We order their XO chow fun appetizer which is really good with a good kick to it.  I love their Seafood Tom Yum Udon hot pot.  It was perfect for the rainy day.  The boba drinks comes in 2 sizes; however, its alot sweeter than how I like it.  It is pricey than normal though.    Although the place is big they do lack decoration ideas and some uniqueness."}
{"text":"expensive and has a cover charge if you don't order something even if everyone else at the table is so lol, nice try satan"}
{"text":"I've been here for about 5 times now and the renovation looks great. Drinks are so so there's nothing too special about the drinks.. But servers were pretty quick. I would've gave it a 5-star rating if the servers had smiles on their faces when they are servicing.  Overall a pleasant experience."}
{"text":"We used to come all the time as they would fry up a simple friend rice/egg for my kids for $3. They also had great $9 combos that had a full entree, drink and crepe dessert. BBT is yummy!  They have since raised the prices and gotten rid of the daily specials.  So.. basically.. now they are a typical bbt place with nothing that really makes them stand out. Before they got rid of the daily special, i would have given 4 stars.  Some pluses, good for big groups, lots of jacks to plug in devices,"}
{"text":"Location: 165 York Blvd Richmond Hill ON L4B 4A7 Price: $$ Service: Okay  I've been there a couple of times. Everything about this place is just okay- nothing spectacular in my opinion. They have a large variety of drinks but a lot of the time this place is over priced. Their small size is extremely small for $6.49...but with an upgrade to a large it's $6.99 (if you can stomach the price and the size). Haha the size kills me though, since the large size is in a vase like glass compared to the small. I ordered their mixed drink: green tea slush and red bean. It was a little too sweet for my taste so it was a waste after only drinking half. I also ordered their coconut & cashew crepe- in fact the coconut ice cream and crepe was yummy. So I do recommend ordering that!  It is very ordinary but it gained a lot of attention because of the vibe and the decor. It has a friendly and hip nature. Recently, it has become more of a family environment.   Verdict: Try?"}
{"text":"Reactivated this account specifically to review this spot... Would not recommend this place to anyone, unless you want to sit around for 45 mins while you wait for your microwaved fried rice. Water, which should be served at the beginning, was served at the end just before the bill - The fastest thing to hit our table was the bill. And to top it off, \"gratuity included\"?... Nahhh"}
{"text":"I've gone here so many times in the past couple of years, but I'm going to decide to stop going.   They were good a few years back, but every time I came the place was just going down hill. Service was poor and the food was okay.  Like I said, I've gone here multiple times so I've come accustomed to their menu. I usually order a small taro milk tea with tapioca and spicy popcorn chicken with rice.  I went here tonight, we were seated right away. We waited around 10 minutes before the server came to us, I didn't think anything of it. We were ready to order when she came. I ordered a taro milk tea with tapioca, squid balls and spicy popcorn chicken with rice, she said she didn't have spicy popcorn chicken on the menu (even though I've ordered it multiple times before). Okay, maybe they changed the menu or something, fine. 4 other of my friends ordered food and beverages as well.  The bubble tea came out first, it was a WAY smaller serving than it was before.  I could have literally finished it within 2 sips. The person who brought it out to us was down right rude. He placed down my bubble tea and right away asked \"who's is this?\", with his hand out. I didn't even have time to take the drink before he rudely asked.  4 out of the 5 main dishes came first. A friend waited 10 minutes after before his food came out. The portion on the popcorn chicken was also smaller. Probably around 20% less than what I was used to there.  After we were finished eating, our server took our dishes and didn't return after 20 minutes. No one came to ask if we wanted the bill, if we wanted more service, or if everything was okay. I tried to call the waitress multiple times, but didn't acknowledge me. Finally different server comes to us and asks of we want the bill, I said yes and asked for separate bills. I asked my friend for the time and it was 12:30am, I personally thought that our original server was done her shift and left for the night. A few minutes later the floor manager comes and hands us one big bill with a pen. We divided it up equally and decided to go to the front to pay.  When we get to the front, our server was standing at the counter punching in someones bill. WOW. I was a bit shocked. The manager went beside the server and waited for her to finish was she was doing before he served us. I told him we marked down numbers on the bill he gave us so he doesn't get confused when we pay. He didn't say anything. I told him I was #1 on the bill, he punched in some numbers handed me a separate bill crumpled up the original bill and gave me the rudest stare ever. I paid, and went outside to wait for my friends.   Horrible service and okay food.  Every time I came to this place a few years ago me and my friends would have to wait to get seated. Now a days the place is half empty, now I know why."}
{"text":"Overpriced for the quality of the drinks. It's nice and spacious inside though and there are outlets for laptops. I wouldn't go there to eat though because the food is overly salty and spiced. As for the drinks, I find that they're not properly mixed as many times I can feel the powder particles."}
{"text":"Destiny has definitely gone downhill since they opened.  I remember back in the day this was my go to bubble tea shop.  They had a wide selection of bubble tea and food but now it's crappy service and crappy food.  The bubble tea is overly sweet and the food is either really salty or the portion sizes had drastically gone down.  It's ridiculous how hard it is to get service and it took me at least two minutes to get a table last time I went and it wasn't even overly busy at 11pm.  I definitely recommend going elsewhere to get better quality and better tasting bubble tea for the same cost."}
{"text":"Nice ambiance and good place for group meet ups but the BBT is no good. Too sweet and prepared without much care (we got our orders bery quickly but soon found out why). My drink wasn't even supposed to have taro jelly but they just threw it in there. My fiance's drink wasn't supposed to have tapioca but it did. We got the fruits with shaved ice dessert and usually when we get this at other places the shaved ice is flavoured. Here, it was just sliced fruits on a bed of ice. Might as well have just given us a bowl of fruit salad and save the ice.  I've never been too fussed about my BBT but I'm starting to take a huge preference for Cha Time which is way better in quality/taste of drinks."}
{"text":"Haven't  been here for years. Service still sucks. Food is decent but it's so slow.   I got the ma po tofu. It's not bad for the price.im not sure I would come here again..  The bubble tea is tiny!!! I finished it with one sip. I'm surprised this place is still open and haven't closed down yet. This should really change to cha time!  The seating is nice... food, service not so much"}
{"text":"I've been here many times.  The servers are okay, but they usually forget any \"special\" requests, like an extra straw or plate. Besides that the bubble tea is yummy and served in huge glasses, and the decor is beautiful. All my friends love going there.  The bubble tea is delish, but the food?  Avoid.  There are way better places to eat  Asian food within a 5km radius.  Definitely a chill place to hang out with friends on a Friday night, lounging on couches and having a laugh, without breaking the bank."}
{"text":"destiny? this confused restaurant/cafe should be renamed to a more fitting name, what comes to mind when I hear destiny is trash. after a long night and a great dinner,  a couple friends suggested destiny as a place to grab bubble tea and relax and that is when the night was ruined. I have never had an experience this unpleasant, the staff were incompetent and clueless not to mention they gave us attitude while we remained calm. The food experience itself was also horrible, I've never been so displeased with something I ate.   1. Let's start with their menu, it's an unclear and atrocious sight that nobody should have to lay their eyes upon. There are so many mistakes on the menu that a five year old wouldn't make, this makes a joke out of their menu, a sad pathetic joke. The visibility of the fine print is another problem, if you do not have 20/20 vision don't even bother looking at the bottom of the menu. But if you don't read the fine print, you won't realize everyone is obligated to order an item off their menu or they'll charge everyone a fee of $3.99 for just being there. Yes,  that's right they'll charge you more for helping their business by even going in there first place, talk about amazing customer service. onto the food, I ordered the pad thai and my friends ordered three items. Understand that my friends ordered a combination of three items which they assumed would be three dishes with altered prices because they ordered more than one item. The moment they received their food you could see the despair on their face, not only did they only receive one small portion that was immensely overpriced, the food appearence resembled what would seem to be deep fried rocks. I couldn't imagine the night getting any worse but sadly it got worse when they brought out my order. pad thai is supposed to be vibrant with color and very tasteful, however mine was brown and tasted bland; I wouldn't be surprised if they poured some soy sauce briefly after microwaving these god awful noodles. This was obviously more Chinese than it was thai, their menu is nothing but gimmicks, you never get what you expect to have ordered. All in all the food experience was appalling and I never wish to come back to this restaurant.   2. Customer service should be valued by every restaurant but however for some reason destiny, instead of valuing their customers they argue with them and give an abundance of attitude. Our waitress couldn't even speak English very well so it was hard to understand her. She claims she said that everyone had to order something or we'd have to pay the fee of $3.99 but no one at our table heard her. When we asked her about it she kept giving attitude and abruptly raising her voice for no reason. I was done speaking to this incoherent animal, it was clear nothing was getting through her head probably due to the fact she doesn't understand the language being spoken to her. We ask her to refer us to the manager and we confront him about this problem. Turns out he's just as much as a tool and decides to treat us the same way, he keeps telling us \"BUY THREE MORE ITEMS OR I'LL CHARGE ALL OF YOU $3.99 EXTRA\". We were beyond fed up at this point and we didn't want to aggravate the manager any further so we asked to speak to the store owner. This manager claims he is the store owner and keeps telling us to buy three items or he'll charge us a fee. We decide that we should just buy three items and get out, we couldn't handle how useless and incompetent these employees were. When we asked for the bill, we seperated it so that everyone pays for their own items. The manager forcefully charges us 10% gratuity for splitting the bill, I've never been to restaurant where they charged you for splitting the bill but destiny is full of unpleasant surprises. We decide to pay a single bill since our experience was dreadful and they didn't deserve the 10% gratuity. Our same incompetent waitress comes back with a single bill and the price is still the same. This caused a huge argument between us and the employees and ruined the whole night. We finally paid and got out of there, Thank god.  In the end destiny provided me with the worst dining experience I've ever experienced. I thought this kind of experience happened on scripted reality television shows but no, destiny is just that bad. Their food presentation is atrocious and they over price everything on their menu. A lot of their food and drinks have the consistency of dog food or cat litter, save yourself the money, gas and time by not visiting this sad excuse of a \"restaurant/cafe\" I've also never had a use for a yelp account but this experience annoyed me so much I had to create one"}
{"text":"It may be an eventual fact that this chain will close in the future.  At least I hope that it will during my lifetime because they have proven over and over again how it has failed my already low expectations for it.   We came here on the weekend for my sister-in-law's birthday as the yearly tradition.  This time the straw that broke the camel's back was a hair found in the popcorn chicken.  We brought it to the attention of our server and while they did replace us with a new batch but it was without an apology.  The worst was they still charged us for it or the least a pathetic discount.  This sort of act was as if it's a norm for patrons to find hairs in their foods it's ridiculous.   This is the last time me and my circle of network will ever give our business to.  Please stay away."}
{"text":"I love this place! There is always an array of Japanese fashion magazine, tasty treats and friendly, quick staff!  This is a great time to get away and be away from the downtown Starbucks.. I think this is better than Ten Rens just because it is beautiful and spacious.  The array of bubble teas and cakes and food is divine! You should definitely go!"}
{"text":"Beautiful venue..love the lighting..great for casual dates!   however, the food is horrible..the popcorn chicken does not smell or taste like chicken and i do not understand why its red...the fried rice is never properly cooked...i have gotten sick after eating their food a few times...and have had some friends get sick as well..  i do love their drinks and thats the only reason i go there now!  as far as customer service is concerned the service is very slow...I always see them standing in the corner but as soon as you call them over they hide"}
{"text":"Hmm, been to this one a few times. I'm not a big fan of Destiny. Servers are asian females and typically gives cold shoulders or just rude. Hate this place and wouldn't go.. unless a friend picks the location."}
{"text":"Way too fancy for a bubble tea restaurant. Prices are reasonable. My peach iced tea was served in a nice glass and tasted alright. Squid was pretty tasty.  They did add gratuity to our bill but our waitress did not inform us about that. I ended up paying a tip on top of gratuity. This has happened to me before. Not cool.  Overall not a bad place to hang out and have a late night chat without alcohol being involved."}
{"text":"First off I would like to say I've been to destiny for years now even before the renovation. It has always been a hit or miss place for me.   Here are my pros: - Comfortable seating and nice ambiance.  - It's a great place for studying as they have outlets and USB ports everywhere. - The food here is relatively good as well, especially after they renovated and updated their menu.  - They are also open late and have long hours, making it very convenient.  - They play a variety of genres for music from Chinese songs to Korean songs to American pop and rap.   Here are my cons about this place: - Customer service here is absolutely terrible, they're slow and never attentive, always on their phone at the front or the back of the store.  - There was one incident where I waited at the front to be seated for 10 minutes and it was empty, the staffs were all just on their phones at the back.  - There has been multiple cases where I ordered and they forgot half my order...  - Another disappointing encounter I had here was when a man came and asked \"are you ready to order\" as if I was just sitting here doing nothing when I already ordered 10 minutes ago... Shouldn't you check on my order instead?  - Despite the fact that I did mention that this may be a great place to study for, I would like to add that their WiFi never works.   However, this is still one of my favourite place to study at because it's quiet with outlets at each booth. Their deep fried shrimp balls with sliced almonds are my favourite item on their menu! A definite must try!!"}
{"text":"Low quality ice cream. All sugar and no cream. Tastes like the 4L stuff you can get at No Frills. This doesn't come close to Summer's or EDS. I would have been happy with Kawartha's or Hagen Dass quality.    Their coffee was terrible. I wasn't even expecting Starbucks quality!  Their washroom is filthy. Luckily, I am man. An upright walking homosapien."}
{"text":"Destiny is a really cool hang-out spot if you just want to sit down for a while & chill with your friends. The ambiance is nice & the decor is modern. The bubble tea is quite delicious :) & I love getting their soup noodles (it's not too expensive & it's very filling)!!! Their tea is kind of pricey though. But you get to sit down for a very long time without waiters bothering you. They are also open very late, so if you're bored with nothing to do after midnight, you can come here :)"}
{"text":"After seeing browsing the reviews, I can say I basically agree with everything that's been said... to an extent.  The interior is fantastic and the 2AM closing on weekends is pretty awesome.  Had this place been here about 12 years ago, this would be one of my Asian date places.  That being said, it's not the year 2000 and the reality is that this place is over priced and just not worth it (I'd prefer Ten Ren's).  They've got a really large selection which is great and all but it's a bit overkill.  I haven't tried the food there but a lot of customers there seemed to be ordering a lot of it (mostly the sweets but I did see a table with some fried food too) so it can't be too bad right?  I was with 3 others and we each tried each others drinks and all 4 of our options were a bit too sweet in my opinion.  And of course, over priced.  Also, I was told the WiFi there is free but none of my table could connect.  Bad day?  Maybe our phones all coincidentally went crazy for our 1.5 hour stay there..... Who knows.    I ended up getting the Wheat Germ Soy.... I don't know why or what came over me that compelled me to do this but that's what I got and it actually wasn't too bad.  In fact, of the 4 drinks we had at my table, it was my favorite.  It kind of reminded me of a half decent protein shake I've made before.  Black Sesame Taro Soy for my girlfriend and it was just far too sweet for me to enjoy.  My bud got Avocado milk and actually this wasn't too bad.  Kind of hard to screw this one up but they added a bit too much sugar for me.  My bud enjoyed it though.  His friend got something similar to my girlfriends except there was ice cream on top of it.  I had one sip and my blood sugar definitely went up.  The service seems to be a common complaint but really, it's not actually that bad.  To me it's like classic Asian service..... the kind of service you would get in Asia.  They come to you when you call them over.  Otherwise they leave you be.  Not really a bad thing in my opinion because you don't feel rushed to get out of there and when we did call a server over or for the bill, they were there within 30 seconds.  I guess this would be a common complaint seeing as we are in Canada and all but honestly, it's the service most Asians would expect... Unless you're dining at a Michelin star restaurant over there.    Anyway, will I be back?  If I'm in the area maybe.  It deserves another chance.  It's a nice place, the biggest problem here are the prices.  All our drinks were either $5.99 or $6.99.  You would get the same from say Ten Ren's for $4.99-$5.99."}
{"text":"This used to be my old high school hangout -- late night Taiwanese snacks and bubble tea, so I was excited to check it out after their recent renovations.  The decor is stunning (especially the middle seating area), but for some reason, they sat everyone to the sides of the restaurant.  Not a big deal, but just odd.  The menu was pretty standard for Destiny's, same types of snacks and dishes (with some new features, of course), but nothing I was super interested in.  I ordered the minced pork and Taiwanese sausage with rice (something I used to order all the time back in the day), my parents ordered the popcorn chicken with rice and a seafood fried rice.  Overall, the dishes were decent, with the exception of the fried rice -- super salty.  The beverages were okay, everyone who ordered a pot of tea claimed it was very sweet.  I ordered a ginger milk tea, to which it was not very hot at all, but good ginger flavour.  The most disappointing part of this establishment was the service -- it must have been the trainee staff or something; because with the exception of a male and one female wait staff, everyone else was terrible."}
{"text":"I love going to Destiny for late night eats. I used to work at one of the restaurants in the area and would sometimes stop by after work for dinner or dessert. I keep going back because although the service is horrendously slow, the food is good, and so are their drinks. They recently re-vamped their menu to include things like brick toast and other new dishes. Most recently when my friends and I visited, we shared the strawberry brick toast and holy moly was it ever amazing. Love this place and will forever be re-visiting it!"}
{"text":"Everyone needs to chill and not freak out so much over the service and whatnot and understand that this place is understaffed and HUGE.   FACT: the take out cups contain more than the in house glasses, so it's actually more beneficial for you to get a take out cup. For those people complaining that the glass cups are a scam, then you've never been to a restaurant before. Have you ever asked how many ounces is in one of those milkshake cups at diners? Answer, not as much as it seems.  The service style is also a difference of culture, to be honest Chinese people don't stress on service as much as food. The pricing is fair if compared to other bubble tea and similar places.  I'm biased because I grew up around this place and worked there for several years but seriously, cut them some slack. AND there's a 10% tip out, so be nice."}
{"text":"Don't waste your time here .my boyfriend and I came here around 12 am on a Thursday and we asked the waiter if it was busy and he said no! So we got our seats and waited for our waiter to come back she said she was going to be 5 mins and she was gonna come back . 25 minutes later and no one took our order not even a \" did you place your order yet or has anyone come by to ask if u have been served\". Not one person came back to take our order. We got fed up with waiting and left the place without even eating .. I reminded my self that this place isn't what it used to be . My advice don't waist your time with no good service ...!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I highly recommend not going here ... Take my advice its happened twice now for us and we thought maybe it would change but nope 3rd time isn't gonna cut it.. I am fed up with this place and the manger doesn't seem to give one care about his costumers.. I would give it a no star if I could ... Please please don't waste your time there are better places out there !!! December 18,2015"}
{"text":"I've been to Destiny many, many, many times with friends. I would absolutely never go to Destiny if it were up to me. This is why:  The prices are moderately high for drinks and food. This would be okay if the quality of their products reflected the prices. The bubble tea is never too great (e.g., too powdery, too sweet, not much tapioca, general weird taste). The cake slices are delicious, but the cooked food is just so-so. Their portion sizes are always smaller than the photos too.  The cups that the drinks are served in are FILTHY. More often than not, the cups aren't sufficiently washed. The sides of cups almost always feel sticky from previous drinks and sometimes there are even lipstick/chapstick prints on the rim. It is disgusting to be served drinks in dirty cups, but my friends keep going back because we get a discount :(. I'm always scared that I will have a \"cockroach Destiny\" experience (Google it!) but thankfully, it hasn't happened yet...to me! I highly recommend that you ask for your drinks to be served in to-go plastic cups unless you want a free taste of somebody's lipgloss. The plastic cups are bigger too, so it's better value for your money. If you order food, don't forget to wipe your forks, spoons and knives with serviettes before using them.  The management is super cheap. If you get a hot drink, they often don't come with sugar. If you ask for some sugar, they will give you one pack. ONE PACK!!! You will have to keep asking your waitress to give you more sugar because the management has told them to only provide one sugar pack at a time. Keep in mind that you'll be putting this sugar into a $5 drink. McDonald's will give you all the sugar you could ever need when you order a $1.30 coffee. Destiny's excessive penny pinching will never cease to amaze me.  The waitresses aren't very friendly or attentive, though they are usually fairly attractive (they're all skinny Chinese girls). You'll be seated and given menus without hearing any words come out of your waitress' mouth. She will come back and take your order, only speaking if she needs clarification on what you want. Don't expect a smile (this is Destiny after all!), so if you get one, she's yearning for a big tip! Remember to check your bill before tipping, because they like to add on an automatic 10% gratuity charge. I guess that's because based on the typical service, most of the waitresses would never hit minimum wage because of the lack of tips.   I'm giving two stars because they allow customers to sit and hang out for a few hours, though they've banned card games. The decor is also pleasant, so maybe the aesthetics will allow you to ignore the poor service and dirty cups.   If you want to go to a similar place that isn't nearly as bad, try Go For Tea which is just across Highway 7. Ten Ren's Tea Time at Highway 7/Valleymede is even better, though their prices are a bit higher (however, their bubble tea is always top notch)."}
{"text":"Compared to the last time I came here (at least 2 years ago), this place has definitely improved. (So my rating is more of a 3.5) I think with all the competition popping up in Markham, they really had to up their game. Their menus have gotten a huge makeover in terms of look and variety. There are a lot more food selections and the drinks have graduated to some really unique selections. They no longer taste like just flavour power and water so paying $6-7 for a drink is starting to make more sense. I've always been a big fan of their decor, which I find very sparkly and modern.   The service has definitely improved from last time. They've apparently moved from hiring incompetent teenagers that seemed to care more about how they look to people that can actually service a restaurant. The only issue I had was there were a couple slip ups with our orders (e.g. extra drink, one drink took too long) BUT given that we were a pretty big group, it's understandable that it happens.   Ultimately, if I were to have rated this place 2 years ago, I would've probably given 1 star (which is why I waited years to come back). Now that they have gotten better, I can see myself coming again on a more frequent basis."}
{"text":"WHY???  Why do I come here?  Oh right, I was invited to hang out with some friends and they picked here. Mind you, it has been a while since I have been here.   This was the first more modern looking Destiny in the area. I still remember coming here the first few times and feeling kind of awkward how booths that accommodates 2-3 people are facing a booth that seats 6-8 people, almost like they're a group, but separated by an aisle.  Anyway, this review is not about those times, this is about this time. We arrive around 10:00pm on a Monday evening between Christmas and New Year. It was fairly busy when we arrived and was seated in about 10 minutes. Not bad.   Our server comes to ask if we're ready to order after about 15 minutes. The five of us each orders a drink and an order of noodles for two people to share. Drinks arrive in decent amount of time, a friend had asked for a glass of water as they delivered our drinks. That water was forgotten and we ask someone else for some water, she returns with one paper cup of water. We weren't expecting a cup for each of us, but some water would imply more than one.   The food eventually comes as well and it looked pretty good. We asked the person who delivered the dish for some small plates, he returns with one. Friends who had the food said the noodles were okay though. Our drinks were okay too.   We did sit a while as this was a catch up of sorts. Around 12:30am, it has already died down, there was about five tables of people remaining and we've decided to call it quits and head home, but we saw no servers for at least 15 minutes, so we agreed to gather all our things and pay at a counter by the door or something. We stand there for about five minutes before we found a server and asked for our bill. She gives it to us right away without saying a word. We checked our bill and asked for her to split it, this server still says nothing. We pay her and she returns with change and short-changed me $10. With her attitude, I'm not sorry I didn't leave a tip.   Did she think we were walking out on the bill? I seriously thought about it though, because we waited 20 minutes to look for someone to give us our bill. I refuse to accept the stereotype just because it's a Chinese establishments that it's to be expected that service would not be good. This another one-star review I had to leave for the Destiny bubble tea chain, I honestly think they need to train their staff on how better server their customers, because I hate myself a little for having come here."}
{"text":"Destiny renovated and looks completely different, the place is nice and roomy. The food was pretty delicious but there wasn't much selection... And the drinks are way over priced, they need some real Taiwanese themed desserts or more dessert choices on the menu also."}
{"text":"These food places are actually getting me really upset. I went there for a late night snack at 11 pm and there were only 2 employees working and it was busy too. I had to wait for 20 mins to order and when the food came they were not hot or fresh (92% sure they were microwaved). And it was super difficult to request for anything cause they gave us a table around the corner. When we were trying to leave we had to get up to the front and ask for the bill u know why? CAUSE NO ONE WOULD COME TO THE CORNER TO CHECK UP ON US. I was actually livid. Congrats Density, you just lost another customer.    TO THE PERSON WHO MAKES THE SCHEDULE: u should be fired."}
{"text":"This Destiny location has been the go-to hang out/birthday spot for us as high school students. We would come here after dinner time to drink bubble tea and chat with friends - it was one of the first super fancy bubble tea places, and had a large space to offer in the event that you brought a giant cake in.  Being on two floors, they have a wide selection of drinks, a bit of food and snacks available for you to order. Also, they don't limit you on the time you want to stay, so it's definitely a good place to go if you want to see a friend that you haven't seen in a long time and want to chat past 12am.   Their cheapest drink is $4.95 - which is a small iced tea with no toppings (tapioca, etc. inside), but you can select the amount of sugar and ice that you put inside. If you want to upsize any drink to a large, it's $1 extra, tapioca costs $0.80 more and if you want jelly, aloe or icecream, it's $1.50 extra. Other than that, they have oriental tea, milk tea, fresh fruit juice, slushes, and their limited edition drinks which can cost approximately $13 each."}
{"text":"Came here once late at night with my friends for bubble tea. I got the peach iced tea with lychee jellies and it was pretty good but I thought it was overpriced.  One of my friends ordered some sort of milk tea and when it was delivered it was the incorrect order, and the server kept saying it wasn't... Eventually the server took it away and came back with a new one, not before it took a really long time. Also, the mandatory tip is STUPID. I wasn't planning on tipping but it's great to know that I'm forced to. Service is kinda crappy, but the drinks are alright. I guess it's a good place to try if you don't mind waiting."}
{"text":"Was here was a late night snack. Super impressed with the waitress that served us. She was super polite and informative which goes a long ways nowadays since good service is rare at most places. Food was alright. The fish and beef balls were a bit overcooked. The service definitely topped it."}
{"text":"A lot of up and down experiences here. Lately - down.   Service is SLOW. One girl was working seating/reception, drinks, and orders. They are quite understaffed it seems. It wasn't that busy but it took a while to get seated. It took a while to get a menu. It took a while to order. It took a while to get our order. It took a while to get the bill. It. Took. A. While.   Had a bubble tea and shaved ice.   The bubble tea was a little too sweet. I heard a group near us leaving, and one of them asked if she was going to finish her drink and she said \"it's way too sweet\" and made a squinty face. Her's was some other drink/not bubble tea so perhaps all drinks might be a little too sweet for some. More importantly the tapioca sucked. It was not chewy. It was mushy - most likely overcooked, or has sat too long/is old. It also tasted like cilantro.... what on earth? This made my bubble tea drinking experience awful, as I am sucking down a sugary drink with pearls that crumble in my mouth. It's a no for me.   Now for the mango shaved ice. Have you ever finished a glass of milk, and had a bit left at the bottom and go rinse your glass/cup? Ok, well next time, put it in the freezer after, and crush the ice. That's what the shaved ice is here pretty much. The only indication that it is \"milk ice\" is that a bit melts at the bottom and is mildly white colored. Toppings are not fresh from what I could tell. If you are in need of a fix for a mild frozen dessert, I guess this will suffice.   Overall, its a little rough, but they are open late so if you have nowhere to be and want asian desserts, I guess you can come here. Or go home, take a sip of mango nectar and chew an ice cube - I saved you $12 and you had the same shaved ice experience, you're welcome."}
{"text":"I used to come here back in 2012 and I had great experiences; very fitting for big groups to hang out.   Things now are drastically different! I came here a couple of weeks ago expecting the same quality drinks. The tapioca was HARD and unsweetened. Their homo milk tea was overly sweet, even though I asked for half sugar. Also, the price per drink comes to ~$7 and definitely not worth the price.   Don't waste your time here, there are plenty of other bubble tea places close by."}
{"text":"Came tonight with a large party. We occupied the entire second floor. Two servers for 100 people, and the servers weren't always there. Ordered in what looked like a storage room with a register. Pay when order. Mandatory tip of either 12 or 18 percent. Can't remember. Don't want to do the math. My $4.99 homo milk tea with tapioca/grass and egg jelly size small. $6.35 after tax and mandatory tip. I didn't even get any service. I got shuttled around and I picked up my drink in a takeout cup. I did not get tissue either... They also got my drink wrong. I asked for grass jelly and egg jelly. I got tapioca and grass jelly. I would have told them, but they took my receipt, and there were a zillion people there waiting on their orders. I had friends who waited more than 30 minutes for their bubble tea order. Not cool.   I'm also a tad concerned about the way the female server dressed. Um... Crop top? Where does one carry a tray? Somewhere close to exposed skin I'm assuming she doesn't wash as frequently as her hands. Not a germophobe, but I would expect a uniform slightly less casual if I'm paying that much for my drink."}
{"text":"If you want overpriced average bubble tea, this is your place.  Food has it's ups and downs. Some of the stuff is really yummy while the others are \"meh... it'll have to do\" My favourite thing to get here is the ma po to fu rice - it's A LOT of rice though, so carb-haters.. avoid! The ma po to fu is made with just the right amount of spiciness. You also get like 4-5 lettuce leaves on the side, which they try to pass off as a salad.  The snacks are okay.. everything is salted just a weeeee too much. Sodium overload? I think so. The popcorn chicken is my favourite there and it's not even that good. It's more pricey than most other popcorn chicken places though but it's not that much better. There is sometimes those soft chewy bones inside the popcorn chicken.. which makes it NOT popcorn chicken anymore. The drink sizes are getting smaller and smaller every time I come here.. the large used to be huge and now they're definitely cheaping out AND charging you 7$ for it. Okay?! The normal milk tea is not that good either.  The restaurant is pretty big, and has a lot of space. I really like the decor of it, and that's why this used to be my place when I was in high school. Oh, young me.. thinking I was cool, hanging in destiny.  The service has improved by a percentage of 100. They used to ignore you and never smile, but now the servers are always smiley and trying their best to help you. Good job destiny!  I guess this is a place you'd come to if you needed a place to catch up with friends, but still .... naaaah."}
{"text":"Came here on a Friday night and it was not even half full. Me and my fd have chosen a bigger table for two of us so we can seat comfortably and discuss business. When we have decided to sit down the server said \"this seat is for 4 or more people and you guys are only two\" sirously how rude! I've worked at restaurant before for years and you should never said that to a customer when your restaurant is not even half full. They should train these kid better! It is obviously theses kids are lacking experience and manner!!! The food was decent but not fabulous. Drinks are reasonable price for the size given. I would give more stars but the service just Kills it. You want people to come here more often. Train your staff properly and teach them what manners are and if you really hate your job don't put that on your face!  For food we ordered the popcorn chicken. It is tasty and they gave a generous amount of portion.  Beef noodles. The bowl is huge but the portion of noddles was so littles and sooo little beef slices.  Tom yum seafood hotpot. Tasty soup but the shrimp are soooo not fresh. Their frozen shrimp is mushy! But this $20 set cab serve 2 ppl as it came with a bowl of rice and noodles plus a plate of seafood and a plate of Edamame.  Green apple herb tea taste like cough medicine. Just this combination is weird. But I must say they the price is worth the portion they give you."}
{"text":"Ask for anything on the menu... they are probably sold out. The service was horrible and the staff was rude. They kept getting our order wrong. We continued to be patient with them. At the end we asked to have seperate bills and the waitress came out with one bill. We asked that it be split between the 5 of us and they said that it is not possible. Also, the menu clearly states that a service charge is added for groups of 8 or more but she still added the service charge even though we were only a group of 5. When we asked why, she made up some bullshit that they add service charges when we split the bill (even though she added the charge before we even split it). We ended up just paying 4 bills because the waitresses did not know how to operate the machine properly. As soon as we walked out of the store we can hear the waitress (I believe her name was Maggie) yelling and cursing in chinese. We felt extremely disrespected. I strongly advise that if you are not chinese speaking, please do not go here. Would never recommend to anyone. If you like the cakes, just go to metro because that's where they get them."}
{"text":"Went out to eat with a group for a late night dinner. The food's great for a cheap price. When I saw the prices, I definitely couldn't believe that the food would be good, but it surprised me. If you don't care about service and you just want a good meal for a good price, then this is the place to go. The waitress stopped paying attention to us after awhile. When we were ready to pay, she brought us our bills, but she didn't come back with the debit machine for awhile. We had to call her back and that's when she told us the debit machine was up front. Food's great. Service is.. eh."}
{"text":"This place was half full when we got there on a Saturday Night. The service was fast and they checked up on us multiple times and delivered Excellent customer service. Wait staff was perfect. The popcorn chicken tasted good we enjoyed the seasoning. The club sandwich special set was good. The rice with beef was delicious. Food came out pretty fast. Bubble tea was a bit on the expensive side but tasted good. The washrooms were clean. We enjoyed our late night snack here. Would come again. Can't really comment on this place if it was full but the wait staff was very attentive."}
{"text":"I am a huge foodie and along with that I always have room for dessert. I decided to try their new menu with the Ferris wheel option. The fruit tea- AMAZING!!!!!!! However their food options were not bad and wasn't great. I'd hope they would bring their flat shrimp pastries as it is a FAN FAVOURITE"}
{"text":"The first time I came here, I remembered not liking the bubble tea and thinking the overall experience was average: 3/5 stars. However, the second time around, I enjoyed (to make up for the first time I suppose). After our helpful server, Priscilla, informed Sarah and I of the most popular dishes, she made some of HER fave recommendations. Her brief reviews were honest and lead to me choosing a rice dish (which is rare because I luuhh noodz). I ordered the sizzling short bbq beef ribs with rice. The meat serving was more generous than I had anticipated (peep the pic), as was the bowl of rice. I looooved the fact that the plate was literally suppaaa hot fiaaa... minus the fact that it burned most of my egg. I also ordered a small hot bbt on the side. Unfortunately, my perspective on their bubble tea did not change; though the smell is delicious, the tea itself is a bit powdery and watered down. I'd give it a 4/5 because I fiiinally found an alternate dish from my regular (noodz) and it was actually quite good and the service was a1. The resto itself is spacious and you can sit there as long as you want. There's free wifi and even little booths for people who study alone with their computers. Take it from me though; I highly recommend to try a sizzling dish if you visit Destiny!!!"}
{"text":"Destiny is the spot to hang out late night with friends sipping tasty non alcoholic drinks and fulfilling the late night craving for asian food.  As someone who doesn't drink alcohol yet loves every other type of drink available, this place really does it for me, and it is open until 4am!  The decor is that amazing Japanese zen minimalist type of design that I really like.  The drink selection is huge and I would say 80% are hit and the rest miss.   The waffles and crepes are excellent too, but you should really share these as even a single order is too much for one person.  3 stars instead of 4 because the music is too loud and occasionally the service can be lacking."}
{"text":"If you want a good laugh come to this place for its \"marvelous\" service. The food/drink/dessert selection is up to par."}
{"text":"This place is ok. They have a wide selection to choose from drinks and desserts. I have ordered dinner here once, and got food poisoning. Their food isnt the greatest so stay away! Also its very difficult to find parking."}
{"text":"Two words...Oreo Cake OMG i think i put the pics up  Food was nothing special but their drinks were tasty and the Oreo cake....made my night."}
{"text":"Just because the place is fancy and the presentation of the food and drinks are nice, doesn't mean the food is actually good. You have to have no taste buds to think anything they cook here is anything close to decent. 2 instead of 1 star because the drinks aren't awful."}
{"text":"I have mixed  feeling about this place.. However, I think that next time, I would know better not to sit in front of the entrance during the very cold weather..  (one of the worse seat in town!!)  Drinks are nice but one of the menu on the items that I really like is gone (the $3.99 rice with minced pork and egg)..  Instead, there are overpriced food items. There are so many places around to grab a bite.. why would anyone want to go here and grab a bite??    I rarely lose my cool but honestly, I had to when they refuse to move us elsewhere (even thoughn there were lots of space) unless we plan to order something else..   Anyhow... will forgive them for this time.. but customer service is left to be desired...  Charge of 12% applies with big groups or when you sit upstairs.. (i actually prefer to sit upstairs)  Make sure when you order a drink, to ask for less sugar or no sugar as they put a lot of sugar in the drinks  also, now they can even print a bill with all the subtotal divided for each individual but a pain for the waiter to calculate or make sure the total is correct when a group is paying in cash with lots of changes"}
{"text":"???Destiny?????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????high tea???????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????? Destiny????????~~???????????????"}
{"text":"A hot spot after a night out, usually after dinner or karaoke, bringing large groups of loud teenagers, girls that try too hard to impress, or couples (and lots of them). Generally, the usual clientelle are Asians in the 16-25 age group.  It's a trendy hang out place, opened late, which is great since there aren't many options in the 905 area on a night out.   Overall, service is a hit or miss, much like their drinks. Did I mention that there is a minimum $3.99 sitting? It's mandatory for you to order something if you're going to sit there, and all $3.99 is going to get you is a small drink. Adding tapioca or upgrading to a large size is $1 more.   Popcorn chicken is a usual order with my group of friends. I don't understand why they keep ordering it as it is too oily and salty to enjoy. But I would avoid the food overall.  Generally, a good place to hang out with friends, nice decor, clean space, and plenty of eye candy to keep you going.   Note: My favourite is taro milkshake or almond milk tea."}
{"text":"Really big and relatively fancy restaurant but the food is not suited for this environment. I ordered the fried rice and fruit shaved ice and was quite disappointment. The rice was nothing special. I was disappointed with the shaved ice - portion was a lot smaller than I expected. I would even say green grotto is better than here. I feel like Mabu Station or ZenQ has better food than here.   I guess this place is okay if you need to catch up with some friends since it's not too loud. Some people come here to study as well from what I've seen."}
{"text":"Last Friday was a night of randomness, unplanned, somewhat spontaneous! Iri,two other friends and myself were trying to decide where to go at 11:30pm, downtown was out of the question. So someone made the executive decision to try Destiny!  I've heard and seen this place before, but have never tried it. I guess there's a first for everything.  The place resembles GO FOR TEA, which in my opinion is similar in terms of menu and drinks.  The decor is nice, and the people are friendly, however on weekends Destiny gets busy.   Our entourage came here for some drinks, both Iriana and I went for their fruit smoothies, which was delish! meanwhile the other two had tea (which smelt like medicinal tea/ Neocitron) lol... overall of this place is a solid 3.5 Drawback were out booths, they were too low, so you can't sit back, but for the most part it was awkwardly comfortable."}
{"text":"Where do i starttttttttttt. Please go in a group so u get to taste a few things. First start off with WATERMELON JUICE.  Then get their CREPES OR WAFFLES.  Then try their brownies. Its soooooooooooooooo good. I cant pick anything specific. Just go nuts. Dont be picky. Try it alll."}
{"text":"I'm giving this place 5 stars because every time I come here I have a great experience. Once in awhile we may get slow service but at the end of the day everyone who works here is always very accommodating and will try to help you right away. Language is sometimes a barrier but if you point to what you want on the menu everyone wins! They do the best they can I wouldn't hold it against them. Worst case scenario they get someone who can speak fluent english and it all works out. The past two times i've came here we've gotten someone who is completely fluent in english so I really think they took some of the recent reviews into consideration. I come here regularly for tea and occasionally get something to eat.  The menu is pretty good, a little limited for vegetarians however lots of seafood and meat options. So far I've had the seafood hotpot, which was delicious and had a great presentation (to be honest I wasn't sure what i was ordering, my first time having hotpot). Definitely had to share my experience with that dish on the gram ;).   Ive shared the ferris wheel appetizer which is an assortment of finger foods on a ferris wheel. Again, great presentation especially when you bring friends out and want to impress them at Destiny.  Last night I had the mushroom udon and again delicious! Our server went above and beyond and even gave us a free dessert. Whatever he put in that dessert worked for me because now I'm writing a review and would definitely go back and indulge in that round chocolate ball of delicious. I forget what it is called but it tasted like a ferrero roche.   Lastly, I want to talk about what we come here for. THE DRINKS! Non-alcoholic of course but still so good! They have a ton of drinks to choose from and they are all presented so fabulously. I mainly come for the herb tea. They serve it with two glasses so you can share with someone, i always ask for a shot of honey which cost about $1.00 (i think). You can get unlimited re-fills of hot water in your pot. We normally go through about three rounds of it before we've had enough/the tea is not strong anymore. My favourites is the longan date tea, apple blossom tea and the rose tea.   The bubble tea is excellent too, honeydew melon is my favourite. There are loads of drink choices to choose from though, you have to go there and find out about them all.  The renovations are really nice, it makes for a great chill spot/late night munchies. We definitely replaced Cha Time with this place because its a nicer experience. Its a little dark outside so you dont realize its open but it is and its great! Lots of people go there with friends and play cards or bring their laptops and do work. I would recommend you try this place"}
{"text":"This place is great if you're craving sweets during late nights. Destiny closes between 2-3 am depending on the day that you go. When I go come here I normally get the seasonal fruit waffles. It's so goood because their fruits are normally sweet and waffles are made fresh. They also serve it with vanilla ice cream, with drizzles of condensed milk and powder sugar. Thinking about it now makes me drool. Also if I'm going there to get a drink, I normally get the mango mix and honey green tea hot, both with tapioca.   Pros : - a lot of seating, this place is huge so never really have to wait  - free WiFi, great place for a study date  - great variety of drinks, desserts and food  - a lot of parking, the parking is shared with other busy business so it may be difficult to find parking on weekend nights   Cons: - the area can be very noisy  - Service can be a little slow at time depending on the traffic"}
{"text":"Question of the night? What happened to the cups?  It was midnight on Saturday, we were seated quite promptly with the place nearly full. We all made our orders and mos of them hot. When the drinks came out, they were all in plastic or paper takeout cups. This is strange, I thought to myself... this is the first time that I didn't receive an actual glass... not sure if the dishwasher was broken, all the cups ran out, they were hoping we would leave quickly... or they just decided to move into a different direction.  The hot cups were massive, and ordering a small hot drink, I could only imagine what the large actually looked like. What I found out when the bill arrived was that they only do take out cups in a large size. But since they were only serving paper cups, I guess we all automatic free upgrade.  I love my red bean.. but this was just too too sweet... just not to my liking, not their fault really. No one else complained, and I never really have anything wrong at this place. Their cake selection is awesome, like the demetres cake shop. They seem to have an even more advanced menu than when I went months ago so if you like unique drinks.... you can be sure to try something new at Destiny!"}
{"text":"Lol just dont go here. Servers clearly only care about tips when all they did was nothing. One time a server made us pay half way through our meal because she was about to leave. Like what if we wanted more things? and when you don't tip them for doing nothing they run after you and ask for a tip. Just run faster."}
{"text":"I just keep getting disappointed everytime that it's time I vented my frustration.  It's just not worth coming here.  First time we found flies in our melon desert, second time there was a hair in our drink.   I've even heard of stories of other creepy crawlers found in the restaurant.  Parking is horrible at peak times (not their fault) and the food is so salty, we end up drinking more water than their regular menu sugar drinks.     Destiny is the typical Richmond Hill/Markham meetup spot at best.  I always want my people to do well in their businesses and franchises but I've lost hope for Destiny.  Great for the young generation who don't know any better,  but for all foodies alike, you guys already know to steer clear."}
{"text":"I used to go here until my friend showed me this. http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=42811155282  Now I just go to \"Go For Tea\". They have better food and sweeter tapioca there anyway.  But to review Destiny is something I cannot ignore, so here goes.   Destiny has some of the most modern interior design I've ever seen for a bubble tea establishment. It is well lit with gorgeous chandeliers and floor to ceiling windows surrounding the space in it's entirety. It boasts clean minimalistic booths, dark wood accents that give it am upscale bistro feel, artistic planters, and the clean white communal seats brightens the room even more.   Although the space is beautiful and the Wi-Fi is free, the drinks don't meet the same standard as the decor. The tapioca balls were tasteless and chewy while the drink flavors leave a powdery taste, kinda like a protein shake that's not fully dissolved. The drink sizes didn't seem to fit the price point as the drinks are much smaller than expected.   If you decide to go on a Friday or Saturday night, good luck trying to find parking as this place is an absolute zoo. You're best bet is to go sometime during the week to avoid the fiasco of finding parking.  Overall I would go back for the ambiance and free Wi-Fi but not for the drinks. For the price, you can get better drinks at other places. If it wasn't for the whole roach thing, I would've given it a 3 star rating solely for the ambiance. But unfortunately for Destiny, you can't undo something like that. Go at your own risk."}
{"text":"FOOD = overpriced, mediocre  ENVIRONMENT = bit loud, but spacious  BUT disgusting washrooms  SERVICE= what service?  huh?"}
{"text":"Nice place to hang with friends. I buy their VIP card to get an additional 10% off; the card is good with wasabi and chako too!"}
{"text":"They recently did a major renovation and even changed up their menu, but after giving it two tries, I was continuously disappointed in their lack of quality in food items. During my most recent visit, we ordered the mango yogurt smoothie & earl grey ice tea. They only had 3 tables of guest in house, yet it took over 20 minutes to make the drink. The mango yogurt was watered down, didn't look or feel like a smoothie at all . The Earl Grey, was warm, there was no ice, and completely tasteless.   Destiny is a good spot if your looking for a nice decor, and spacious spot for large groups. But if you are looking for a good bubble tea spot, there many others in Scarborough & Markham area."}
{"text":"High end bubble tea at a convenient cross roads location for meeting various friends in the north eastern part of the GTA. The large coconut slushy is larger other places but all 'n' all a fairly safe lifestyle choice for a first date that's not a coffee date but maybe not ready for the wine 'n' dine play."}
{"text":"Came here for drinks after lunch. This place is big seems to be a bit renovated since the last time I came over a year ago. The decor is good. As for the drinks it is quite average."}
{"text":"I'm from Minnesota, where there are two, maybe three bubble tea places in the Twin Cities area; I'm talking TRUE bubble tea places, not the joint that also serves bubble tea.    Right when you pull up to this place, you think, \"Is this really a bubble tea place?\"  It's a huge location with very tasteful decorations inside.  It looks like the idea was to provide a beautiful and elegant place to socialize with friends/family (or do homework and play Magic cards...).    I stopped here with a friend to grab a \"night cap\" after dinner.  We were seated immediately and handed menus.  The selection is ridiculously huge!  There were plenty of bubble tea concoctions to choose fromt; along with desserts and hot dishes as well.    There was was a little slow, at least slower than what I'm used to back in the States; but he eventually came back and I ordered a traditional hot milk black tea (large).  It arrived in what looked like a large beer mug and came with a side of sugar.  Great beverage and certainly what I needed to end a long days work.    Parking is easy, wifi is ok and the service was fine.  I'd for sure go back!  - 4 stars on beverages - 3 stars on service"}
{"text":"I came here with my sisters yesterday and we ordered a lot! It's more on the pricier side, there's literally nothing on the menu that's cheaper than $5, and these are drinks we're talking about. The lady that helped us was friendly but after she took our order she never came back. We had to get out of our seats to ask for water. The food and drinks were pretty good, but I'm still iffy about the prices. I've read a lot of the reviews here and they seem to be really negative, maybe I got lucky and got one of the nicer servers?  Would I come back? Probably."}
{"text":"Food and drinks aren't the best, but they're good enough, and the atmosphere is great to hang out with friends and play some cards games! It's my go to when I want to hang out with people but not drink - it's like a pub for tea."}
{"text":"Average food and decent teas for an insanely high price. Destiny is not a good destination for your boba or your hunger needs  First off the service was terrible. It was beyond Asian terrible. At least at other places your food actually shows up quick. Or even shows up. My shoyu ramen was served to another table. Waiters were slow and would ignore you when flagged down. The waitress while nice and attentive was looked just as flustered as we were. Rude asian service is okay as long as the food shows up...it did not   The tea itself was actually not bad. A distinct creamy oolong flavour with very soft chewy tapioca balls. The portion size was for ants   The seafood hotpot was sad. No extra bowl is provided so there is no space to actually cook everything. It's very small so nothing fits. Ur noodles and seafood will get over cooked while other stuff gets undercooked if u don't eat fast enough.it was stressful   The popcorn chicken was standards. Crispy and oily with an msg flavour that burns the tongue"}
{"text":"Came here on a Thursday night at about 9pm with a group of 6. We asked for 10, but some of our friends couldn't make it later. It wasn't that busy so we got spots right away.  We ordered drinks and they arrived quickly. But instead of the typical glass mugs/glasses that bubble tea drinks usually come in, they were in plastic take-out containers. First impression wasn't great. So we asked one of the servers why we got this and he said they ran out of mugs. I'm not sure how they handle weekends if they don't even have enough mugs on a Thursday night. What was worse was we saw a couple nearby getting glass mugs after us. You might think this isn't a big deal, I mean, who cares what it comes in. But you don't go to a restaurant to sit in and eat and get served your food in a take-out box so this felt exactly that. We might as well got up and left.  One person asked for no ice in their BBT, but they came with 3 BBTs with no ice. Honest mistake, sure, but doesn't leave a good impression with no apology. They just brought a container of ice.  When we got the bill, they charged on gratuity on it already. We asked why, and they said since we originally asked for 10 seats, they had to charge it as if they were more people. That was obviously ridiculous since it's not like they did more work for us and the place wasn't even busy. We told the server and she had to get the manager to change it. He came back with the bill without even saying a word and just dropped it at the table.  The service here was so crappy that I didn't even have time to talk about the bubble tea quality. They use powder milk and flavors for all their milk teas, which is not worth the $5+ price. You're better off going to Ten Ren's and getting good quality bubble tea than ever coming here."}
{"text":"03.24.2018 - This is my first time here.. I ordered Deep Fried Tofu, Spicy beef noodle , and Tapioca milk tea. My cousin ordered Hot Matcha Latte  and Waffle w/ chocolate, strawberry, banana and banana cream ice cream    1. I really liked the Deep fried Tofu 2. I love spicy  food, the spicy noodle wasn't that spicy for me. So the waitress suggested I try the suicide beef noodle  *next time I go I will definitely try it* the beef was very soft and would break apart easily  3. My tapioca milk tea was okay, I don't like to much sugar but I had to add a little to this drink *I don't know if that's how it should taste regularly ?. The tapioca was nice and soft  4. The hot matcha latte was good, they give you sugar on the side... but you don't need it in my opinion it's very sweet.  5. The Waffle w/ chocolate, strawberry, banana and banana cream ice cream  was good, the waffle was soft and the ice cream tasted like it had condensed milk mixed in it, that was yummy    Overall the ambiance was good and it was a nice experience, our waitress was polite and helpful."}
{"text":"Terrible service, all staffs have bad attitudes and are all incompetent. Store manager disrespectful. Food over priced for small portions that were not satisfying. Unnecessary charges for people who are not interested in dining, charged extra for asking to split the bill with friends. Highly unsatisfied with the experience here and do not recommend to anyone!"}
{"text":"The WORST bubble tea I've ever had!!! Honestly, I'm not picky at all; like you can screw up my order and I'll roll with it (tbt to when ten rens put cinnamon instead of black pepper on my food or when they put mint syrup instead of lychee syrup in my strawberry bubble tea- like I don't care), but this was absolutely awful! I got the regular Oolong Milk Tea for $4.95 with less ice and it was not sweet whatsoever. I usually get half sweet but this time I didn't and it literally was not sweet at all! Basically it tasted like bittery, old tea (that's been sitting for WAY too long), but at the same time it tasted watery? I usually take my milk teas half sweet so I can taste the tea too but this was horrendous and gross! When I got my drink, it came clear and I was told to mix it, so I did. At the top were weird white glops that I tried to dissolve but honestly that didn't do anything other than make the drink look like milk tea because it still tasted like nothing! Makes me wonder what those were. My friend got the same and hers was bad as well. The decor of the place is really really nice, I just don't understand how they could serve something like that. Will never come back!!"}
{"text":"Food is ok. Drinks and deserts are decent. Service needs a lot of improvement. Only reason I gave this place a one star was cause of the service. The Fact that I had to hunt down a waiter to serve me and for repeated requests. Part of me wanted to give this place a chance but when I had to wait 45 minutes for my dish to arrive on a quiet day, I kind of draw the line."}
{"text":"I have come to this location on a few occasions. The place is busy but there is a lot of seating available since the restaurant has a huge space. Ambience is nice and they have both tables, booths, and lounge chairs for a variety of purposes depending on why you're hanging out for a bbt shop.  I like their food. It's not cheap though, but usually I get their noodle bowls. A few apps I do like: popcorn chicken. Must get. Seriously. It's addictive and delicious, albeit on the oily side. But it is flaky and soft and breaks apart easily. Gyoza are the usual, nothing special. Takoyaki is another one that is pretty good. The chicken wings are okay, but I don't feel it's worth the money.   For the drinks they have a few I really like on the menu. I love the ice cream drinks, super rich, delish - get the strawberry or mango. And sesame!!  Another favourite is their honey aloe drink. It's honey tea with aloe jelly :)   Last but not least. Signature mango mix is THE BOMB. It's mango slushie with chunks of mango and jelly :)  We decided to try the Oreo milk tea Coz it's on the menu. Presentation is great. The taste, meh. It's basically milk tea with a thin layer of Oreo cookie crumbs. The rock pieces is basically coated candy. The milk tea however is lukewarm. I was expecting it to be cold but it was room temperature. I didn't mind it Coz I was cold but my fiancé did not like lukewarm bbt.  Anyway a great place to hang out and chat. Their service needs improvement though because for a place this big they need call buttons... Esp when ppl don't walk around that often and usually I have to leave my hand up for 5 mins."}
{"text":"It is actually 3.5 stars.  This review is for lunch special on weekdays only.  My coworkers and I came for Friday lunch.  The lunch specials were all priced at $8  which included a small salad and a basic hot/cold beverage.  Customers can order bubble teas and other specialty drinks for added charges.  The rice and noodles entrees arrived in 5 to 10 minutes.  Stir fry noodle and rice took 15 minutes and above.  But the waitress forewarned us about the wait at time of placing the order, so it was fair.  I ordered a spicy braised beef soup noodle.  It was very mild, more like a hint of spiciness.  The broth was boldly flavoured and delicious still.  The braised beef chunks were big and tender.  The lunch special selection was limited and similar to what you could purchase at HK tea cafe.  I think this is what Destiny aims to be for lunch hours - a mini HK tea cafe.  I suppose customers can order food from the regular menu instead of the lunch special menu, but I don't know how long the wait time would have been considering the kitchen has to make one special dish separately, as opposed to mass produced lunch special items.  The service was sufficient and fast.  The server split bill for each of us no problem.    The decoration was modern and nice."}
{"text":"Really good tea shop for catching up with friends, study, or doing group work. They place is really big and they have power outlets at the booths for you to charge your computer. The bubble tea was average though and the price is like those teashops such as Chattime/Sharetea. We didn't get any food items so I can't give any opinions on those. I wish they have board games because this place is really great for hanging out."}
{"text":"Food is okay. Not bad for late night snacking but their slushie x ice cream drinks are super refreshing"}
{"text":"Solid place, nice decor. A real long-standing Toronto fave spot, have been coming here for over 5 years before all the chains rolled in. Good place for late night snacks, bubble tea and chilling. There's free WiFi, good amount of outlets and the music is never too loud but enough to mull over quiet moments with friends."}
{"text":"After renovations the menu and atmosphere is great & I expected their crappy service/workers to improve. The original crappy workers changed but replaced them with rude ones.   The workers are so hard to call as well and you can see them just chatting away at each other being goofy, dancing and being on their phones which is probably the reason why they cannot see a customer trying to get their attention.   No where did it say I was required to pay tip/ I will not pay tip to a worker who did not even check on my table and to one who complains that I did not tip enough. It is called a SERVICE tip so I will tip if my service is GOOD. they do not think of why they did not get tipped.   The first time I came to the newly renovated place they did not even give me my change back, I had to ask. If they thought I was tipping 30% they got me all wrong.   Was a good customer but after more than 5 instances of bad service It's not worth it to come again anymore."}
{"text":"Recently dropped by for a Saturday night visit and was surprised that this place has managed to stay open for as long as it has. 5 years ago this place was a hot spot to hang out, but I just don't see why anyone would bother these days. The only redeeming quality about this place is the size and space. The decor is actually really nice, good for a date. There's ample seating (even an upper level), and they don't seem to mind you staying for an extended period of time. To be fair however, it wasn't exactly busy, which is a little bit surprising given that it was a Saturday night. Years ago, this type of place would be packed to the brim, perhaps a sign that much of their clientele has moved on to greener pastures.  Disclaimer: I have never had the food here. And from what I've heard, the food is OK for a BBT place.  My harsh 1-star review is based on three things: 1) the drink, 2) the price/value, and 3) service.  1) The bubble tea simply was not a pleasant flavour, especially when compared to the plethora of fine BBT options that exists these days (e.g. Coco, Chatime, etc.). I also tried the kiwi juice, which was one of the worst kiwi juices I've ever had. The tapioca was mushy beyond belief, as if it was overcooked to hell and back. Blech.  2) As far as price goes, when you're paying $6+ for a drink, you expect the quality to be decent, but they simply do not deliver. Overpriced. And when you're sitting down at the restaurant, they serve you your drink in a very cheap, flimsy plastic cup. I understand it's economical especially if people leave and want to take their drink with them, but the cheapness of the plastic was reminiscent of a $2 food-court Bubble tea stand. They should take a hint from GoForTea and TenRen's, both large establishments in the same area, charging similar prices. The drinks there are actually pretty good, and they serve them in a proper glass cup.  3) Our waitress was friendly and courteous but the wait times for food/drink were so ridiculously long."}
{"text":"Orders: Mocha bubbletea (tongue depressingly sweet), Honey milk tea (ok), Sizzling beef w/ rice (eh, mediocre), honey chicken w/ rice (no ty), spicy ramen  (eh okay).  Pros + Ambiance  + Great for studying/doing work  + Comfy sofas, rock hard benches  + Clean restrooms + Big groups friendly + Wide selection of specialty drinks  Cons  - Hard to find parking  - Slow service  - Mediocre food  Overall: Drinks 3/5, Food 2/5"}
{"text":"Quick observations:  1) This place is always busy.  2) The service LAGS. Honestly, for the price of one chandelier, they could have one more server on the floor every night for a year. At least one more...   3) The teas hot or cold are good, not great; food is over-seasoned; desserts are yummy!  4) The design overpowers the content. I can't believe this is a tea/dessert/non-fine dining restaurant. You've gotta be kidding me. My Norcal friends would go bonkers. This should be a club, ultra lounge, upscale...   Pauper in a Prince's clothing...  2.5 stars"}
{"text":"Great late night place for group hangouts and desserts!   Pros: - Parking: As long as you don't go during prime time, you shouldn't have a problem with parking. There are lots of spots around the building! If you go at night after dinner, you will probably have to wait around for parking.  - Seating: Tons of seating, regardless of the size of the party. I've gone here with about 10 people and we were seated right away. There are two floors to this location. If you plan on studying here, there are seats with outlets. Just make sure you ask for a table with one. It is a very spacious area, you really don't feel cramped.  - Points: They now have a points system so I definitely recommend using your Vicinity card and collecting points.   Cons: - Pricing: The items are priced pretty high, but considering its a sit down area it is expected. You are paying about $6.00-$8.00 a drink with toppings and all (depending on what your looking for). Considering the quality of the drinks, I would say that is pretty high.  - Consistency: Over the years that I've been coming here, I would say that the consistency in the food and drinks have changed a lot. The drinks/food used to be better and they are hit and miss.    Foods/Drinks I like: - Jamocha Almond Fudge Cake - Incredible Crust - Nut Buster Cake - Condensed Milk Toast  - Seasonal Fruit Waffle - House Special Iced Fruit Tea - Mango Mix - Mango Ice Cream Drink (Pretty much all of the flavours taste good) - Minced Pork Sausage Fried Rice - Dragon Fruit Smoothie - Grape Soda with Bubble Bubble - Mixed Berry Waffle   Overall, I will probably come here with a large group of friends if we need a late night spot to go too but won't come here out of my way."}
{"text":"Haven't been here in a while but very pleased with the visit.   Large milk tea with egg jelly and grass jelly for $5.99 - the sweetness was just perfect and the milk tea was silky smooth.  Gomphrena tea $6.99 - the tea itself had a very light flavour and was very good. The teacup was so tiny it was like I was drinking from a toy teacup set. The only way I could hold the cup was to pinch the cup handle with a thumb and a finger.   Condensed milk toast $3.99 - super thick toast with a crust that just peeled off. Really crunch crust. The condensed milk was caramelized on the top. A very good snack and would order again if I had the chance.  Truffle Royale cake $5.99 - silky smooth chocolate layer and very moist. Would have it again in a heart beat."}
{"text":"Destiny is the go to bubble tea place if you're looking to dine in or hang out. After all these years, Destiny still gives out its modern and cool vibe. Drinks are good, but you can find better at some of the new competition in the neighborhood (Chatime and The Alley come to mind). The snacks are ok too, but I havnt tried too many."}
{"text":"One of my favourite places to hangout. Relaxed environment, big tables, and great drinks! Also, the fruit waffle is really good!"}
{"text":"Good olé destinies lol. The drinks are good but some are overpriced and smaller. Heck a lot of the main foods are smaller now compared to a month ago.   The staff is friendly from what I've seen. Although the crows you can get in there are a lot of youngins and that can be quite annoying.. but if you looking for a place to chill destinies is still not that bad just careful on certain nights.   Mango mix all day, but again this thing used to be massive back in the day.. now its like tiny so sad.. :( still really good but the money for it and size definitely sucks. The popcorn chicken is a crowd favorite I thing.. simple, tasty and honestly popcorn chicken how could you mess it up. It'd be an insult if you did! The main food portions are getting smaller I swear.. I can literally eat two plates full of rice to be full... back then one plate was good enough!"}
{"text":"Food and drinks alright. Terrible service! Server got our friend's order wrong then got mad at us! Servers should learn to roll their eyes after they leave the table. Enforced 15% tip."}
{"text":"Been going to this place for such a long time and seeing it develop into what it is today, it's amazing. The ambience is so romantic and modern that it gives you a classy feel as well.  Their menus now offer dim sum and western style afternoon tea as well. But they still have your favourite Taiwanese snacks that everyone tends to order everywhere they go.  The servings upgraded a bit and of course, with the upgrade of this place, the prices also went up a dollar or two which is fine if you don't come here everyday just to feel classy.   Recommendations:  Fried squid balls Popcorn chicken Hotpot  Build your own crepe/waffle  Fruit tea"}
{"text":"The service here is just absolutely horrible! We went as a group of 5 people for some light tea and to share dessert. We had eaten a big dinner and were not hungry, just wanted to sweeten our mouth with some dessert!   However, when we got there  were forced to order 5 items off the menu because we were 5 people. Apparenly that is their \"policy\". When we asked the server about the details of said \"policy\", she said the policy is only in effect sometimes when the restaurant is busy and people are waiting for tables. So it is not even a consistent policy, just when they feel like it. Half an hour later, the restaurant was not that busy - so did the policy go out of effect?   We told her that if we ordered 4 dishes, and the fifth person left the table and went home, then we would be following the policy but the table would still be occupied....i.e. this policy does not help with the overflow of guests. She didn't really bother to engage, just kept saying it was the policy and  insisted we must order another item so we have 5 orders for 5 people.   I told her that she should let her manager know we won't be coming back, and that this policy of trying to suck money out of customers (who are already paying more than needed for subpar food/drinks, to be frank) is actually backfiring because they are losing us all as customers. I kept saying it's not HER fault she has to implement the policy, but that she should make her manager aware of this.   She literally walked away while I was talking and just never came back to our table for the whole time we were there. It was really strange.   The last time we came there, we asked for another spoon and were told that the item we ordered only comes with one spoon. They have no concept of customer service, and going there just ensures that you'll leave unhappy and frustrated.   There is no way this place is staying open for much longer."}
{"text":"I don't go here for fast service.   I don't go here if I know what kind of food I want.  I go to Destiny if I want a slow cup of tea (or glass of bubble tea) served in the company of friends.  I go to Destiny to have conversation, laughter, and to catch up.  There is no rush here.  This place is big and has almost anything you could crave if you're peckish.    The ambiance is brightly lit and there is always music playing - a dull hum from all the frequent customers.  You don't go here if you want a bubble tea that tastes perfect - BUT you come here if you're looking to chill out and just talk."}
{"text":"I really enjoy these types of tea houses. The service is never consistent but as one of the reviews stated below, they are more concerned about the food. We had a fruit & vanilla crepe and honey citron tea. The crepe had fresh kiwi, strawberries, and bananas, and was served with two generous scoops of ice cream. I would definitely order that again. As for the tea, the presentation was the highlight. It came in a glass teapot with dried citron slices and a tealight candle lit underneath. The tea cup itself was mini and also made out of the glass. As for the taste, it was just okay. Although it was worth a try, next time I will stick to their specialty drinks."}
{"text":"Good drinks (pricy tho compared to pmall), shitty crappy microwave food, I had the pan fried noodle which tasty like yeaterdays leftovers in the microwave,   This place should be nice and clean and it's still nice but I can't say much about cleanliness...chairs and pillows all have stains"}
{"text":"It's been years since I went to Destiny.  My girlfriends and I decided to grab a drink after dinner Friday night, luckily we arrived at 2130 and not 2200 as the place started to fill up. The drinks were okay, I remember them tasting 'richer', I ordered a sesame milk tea and it was  a bit watery for me. Our server was lovely, she was polite and patient. We ordered one plate of snack and one drink each...and sat there for 2 hours. This is a great place to catch up with old friends with no seating time limit. The only downside was the lingering smell of food on my hair and clothes."}
{"text":"Food was subpar and not worth the price and service was non existent. The place wasn't busy at all when we came and I can see why now. Food was also unreasonably slow to come out.   I asked for a spoon halfway through the meal and it took over 20 minutes for the waiter to return with it! It seemed like all staff was on training.   They even had the audacity to charge a 12% \"service charge\" for splitting the bill. WTF!?!   I am never coming back here again and am for sure not recommending it for any friends!!!"}
{"text":"Is a trandional brand bubble tea since ten years ago, come back for a supper. The place is still very nice. Comfortable environment to sit and have a conversation with friends or even study. Not as noisy as other bubble tea store.  Food and drink is above average at this price range and the service are reasonable. For sure will come back more often."}
{"text":"There have been some changes to Destiny and I'll focus on that.  You can assume anything else has stayed the same.  Destiny's menu received a bit of an overhaul as certain items have been either added or slightly changed.  There a lot more options as to what to get now and, for the most part, prices remain a little high for what they are.  However, unlike before, the quality has improved.  I went with three friends and, for the most part, we all enjoyed our food.  This is really nice to see.  However, where my disappointment still exists is with the customer service, which really hasn't improved.  The waitress we had didn't seem to know a lot about the menu and wasn't confident in any of the questions asked to her.  Not only that, but she also asked us to pay the bill earlier because \"she was about to finish her shift\". I'm understand she's about to get off work, but why was it necessary that we pay at the time you want us to? We said okay because we didn't plan to order more, but what if we wanted to order more and why do you specifically need to be there for that?  The biggest problem now?  A new 'service charge'.  The menu has something along the lines of \"A 15% service charge will be applied to orders that are for 8 or more guests and for a total cost above $80\".  This implies that you'll be charged that charge on either 8 guests 'AND' for an order above $80 (for the table).  As in, both conditions.  However, when we received our bill, it was added.  We asked our waitress about it and she got her manager.  The manager says that it's their policy to add that 15% charge in place of tips and that we're free to add nothing more to that.  This charge also covers things like Wi-Fi.  This also implies to me that the waitresses don't directly get the tips that customers give... (how on earth do you determine how much is for the tips and other things like Wi-Fi?).  The problem with this service charge was that we only had 4 guests, not 8.  But the manager said that we had above an $80 total bill.  But the menu says you need both conditions to be met, not just one.  After a long discussion, in which nothing was cleared up at all, he ended up waiving the 15% service charge, reluctantly.  I didn't give much of a tip because of that mess and our waitress who was pretty subpar.  The short version here is: Beware that they tack on an extra 15% to your bill if you have 8 or more guests OR have at least $80 on your bill.  My friends and I went to this place over Go For Tea to play board games because it's closer but that 15% \"service charge\" is completely unnecessary.  Part of the manager's point was that other Asian places are applying it and this isn't entirely true - I've only seen it at a few places.  If you're like us and like going to a place to play board games and to grab dinner, you may want to consider somewhere else if you don't want to be charged that extra 15%."}
{"text":"About a 2.5. The whole time we were here, we were just thinking if only Chatime allowed us to sit down and have dinner.  The only good thing seemed to be the decor. Service was very slow. It took forever to get our bill. The drinks were small... and even smaller if you think about the ice they had put in the cup! The kimchi fried rice was good and tasty but the chunks of kimchi could be cut up a bit smaller.   Parking is usually such a hassle during prime hours but not too bad when it's late in the evening."}
{"text":"This place has been the to go chill place at late night for me and a lot of my friends since high school. They have a huge place, with dimmed lights for atmosphere. Drinks-wise all their drinks are decent (not superb). The one thing is that the amount you get does not only depend on what size you ordered (small or large), it also depends on the shape of the glass they serve the drink in. Once my friend ordered a drink in large, he got a very thin-shaped glass filled with ice which he was able to finish in like just a minute. He told me it felt a lot less than other drink he had here.   They have a really nice food menu though. They got all the typical Taiwanese-Chinese snack foods such as fish balls, meat balls, sausages etc. They even got Japanese snack foods like Takoyaki! They also serve full meal dishes such as fried rice and noodle soup. I once had their spicy beef noodle soup and I really liked it, fair warning, the soup was very VERY spicy.  Overall a decent place to chill and hangout with friends. Also good way to grab late dinner if you ever missed dinner for some reason."}
{"text":"Saturday night is not a good time to visit, as I drove around the parking lot for about 10 mins before finding a parking spot.  I ordered a large sesame milk tea. Sesame often sinks to the bottom of the cup and I had to stir it (which is fine since sesame is heavier than milk). What's not ok is their butter coconut toast. The top is lightly covered with butter and the coconut sprinkles are barely there. The bread was plain white and clearly not put into the toaster. So I pay $5 for essentially bread with butter. Go for tea makes better toast and I probably won't order toast from Destiny anymore"}
{"text":"This place is overpriced! Its bubble tea is more expensive than Chatime, or even Ten Ren's Tea. The drinks aren't amazingly phenomenal. You actually pay for the decoration, the warm, fancy atmosphere and that's it.   They have a great variety of choices for both food and drinks. The quality of their drinks are okay. Too much ice in their blended drinks, which make them flavourless. The tapioca is hard.  Their snacks are mostly salty. The chicken popcorn is good, but yes, salty and the portion is small (not worth the price you paid). However, I like their Mapu Tofu with rice.   I used to come here often with my sister during the cold days. We sat there and talked. If we were there with a group of friends, we would play some card games. The staffs wouldn't care how long we would sit there. They basically just tried to ignore us as best, and we barely saw their smiles. Staffs were cold and careless.  I just only like their warm lighting decorations."}
{"text":"I haven't been to Destiny for a long time so we decided to check it out. The decor was still the same but a little worn down. Lots of loud music, but not too loud that you can't chitchat with friends. There is lots of magazines and playing cards to read. I couldn't seem to connect to WIFI.  My friend ordered a Hokkaido Milk Tea with Bubbles and I ordered a Oolong Milk Tea. The waitress was very friendly. However the bubble tea was horrible. All I can taste was milk and the milk tasted more like cream but not. I couldn't finish the drink and we were in and out under half an hour.   I don't recommend this restaurant if you are soley drinking bubble tea. I won't go there again"}
{"text":"Ok a book club wanted to go to this plce and i arrived late!  Ok i arrived and no one asked if i wanted anything.  Ok so i was thinking i need to order and they bring it tome ok.  No one for the hour left i was thier never check in to see if they wanted anything or if things were ok.  It ws not packed and they had 3 staff!  Hmmm  Coustmore services is a thing they should improve on!  It was 2 pm!  Helllo people tip!!   Each of my firends had to go out and ask for the check and when they came back to pay someone came over asd asked how they would be pauing we said cash (it was lout on the table) they walked away and five miunts later no one shoed up we ened walking to the frint to chash out!!!    The tunes were tooo LOUD they should turn it down!!     Over all not a good time to go!!"}
{"text":"One star for the drinks only!  Bad, bad, bad service.  So we were just 2 on a Sat night (11pm) and got seated right away.  The place was semi full and we ordered a hot taro drink, reg bubble tea and cake.  We waited, waited, and waited.  I saw other tables around us that sat after us, ordered, and got their food and drinks.  I called my waitress Kaway over about 25 mins later and asked what's taking so long.  She said they are making it right away and left.  10 mins later, the drinks finally came but they made my hot drink a cold one and I told the runner and he took it back.  This took another 10 mins to make.  When it came, I told them to cancel the cake as it's just too long and we were not in the mood anymore.  Funny, when you decide to cancel anything from an Asian establishment the food miraculously appear right away!  Overall, the drinks were ok, cake was something you can buy from Sobey's (no wow factor).  We asked for the bill and thought that she would at least comp us for the long wait but none (oh yeah, this is an Asian establishment).  When I asked her she said she can't cause she's not the manager so I asked for the manager.  He came and we explained what happened.  He came back with a 10% off and left (no apology, no smile, nothing).   We paid the exact amount and left.  Will not come back as there's tons of dessert houses around."}
{"text":"Recently came here yesterday with my girlfriend and we had a few drinks and some fries and onion rings. I had ordered the strawberry slush and she had got the taro slush. The drinks were good and the strawberry slush was flavourful and sweet. The fries and onion rings were ok. Just like any other place  Ok now we talk PRICES: $$ For a good time for two, your looking to spend about $30+. The drinks were both $6 each for a small. $1 more and you could up grade it to a large. I recommend doing this as the large is pretty tall. The drink in the picture is a large. The fries and onion rings were personal sized and was $8. Lets just say u could go to harveys and get the same amount for $3. The portion was extremely small for the price, even for one person.  I saw some desert get brought to another table (waffles and ice cream and fruits) which looked really good! I would come back here and try it.  Last tip; I read a yelp review before coming here and it said you need to not only wave you hand but your whole arm to get some service lol. This is true!"}
{"text":"Standby tea house that's always spacious, quick and has wifi.   The food is tasty but most come for the speciality drinks including hot teas and milk teas.    Service is courteous but not spectacular.    Would come anytime when looking for a late night place to chat with friends."}
{"text":"Very overwhelming menu ranging from drinks- many, many drinks- to all kinds of cooked foods, to all kinds of desserts. There are many choices that seem delicious but it will definitely take more than one visit to go through all of them.   Overall though, the quality of the desserts and drinks is pretty good. It also helps that there are fairly sized portions."}
{"text":"Ate here with a family of 4 adults and one kid. Total bill was about $100 which included $12 automatic 15% gratuity cause our bill was over $80??? Common food and nothing special, place was quiet on a Friday night. Not coming back as it was bad value."}
{"text":"I am actually going to give them 4 stars. Great selection of Taiwanese snack foods and desserts, lots of seating, and for the most part the decor is a modern and clean. Great place if you want to go somewhere and talk as it is not too loud. The location is very good but parking is an issue."}
{"text":"Bubble tea is sometimes a little too sweet, but I'll give it to them for their large bubble tea size! Food is always good to eat but a little on the pricey end for what you receive. I recommend this place for a good sit down catch up, study session or bubble tea go-to for treating people from out of town. If you're a bbt fanatic I would recommend the other bbt joints down the street like Coco or Chatime instead."}
{"text":"Pretty amazed by the high end elegance of the place. When they said tapioca boba tea, I'm thinking more likes small cafe environment. I walk in and it's vaulted high ceilings, high end interior design and ambiance more suited to an upscale lounge bar. Decor rivaled that of pristine and cleanliness, they even had free wifi. Drinks were pretty good, wasn't too bad or great. Expected the freshness. I'd go back again for sure when I visit Toronto"}
{"text":"Completely disappointed with this Destiny location. My friends and I were attracted to the beautiful interior after their renovations and decided to give this location a try as we frequent the Richmond Hill one. We were surprised with the menu as it was completely different from the other locations.   The first major problem would be the service or the lack of it. There were many servers walking around but none were attentive to customer needs. The language barrier was also a huge issue as the servers only spoke mandarin and didn't understand English. Ordering was difficult and we literally had to use Google translate.  The food was also disappointing as it was not worth the price. I ordered the popcorn chicken on rice (the most basic fail proof dish) but it was so dry that I couldn't even finish it. I tried asking for sauce to eat it with but as the servers didn't understand, I eventually gave up asking.   All my friends and I left feeling extremely disappointed and we will most likely never come back. Was hoping for some good eats but ended up with overpriced and unsatisfying food. Next time we will know to go back to the Richmond Hill location."}
{"text":"First impression: really overpriced bubble tea. Ordered a peach green tea large size and the total came to $12 including tax and tip. Laughable, really. I feel like this place is good if your group is hanging out for a LONG time (2 hours+?) then it might be worth it.   However, if you're looking for a place to hang out with your friends with good bubble tea at a reasonable price, this place probably isn't for you.  I would perhaps get food here, but I'm just really unimpressed with the price tags that they just slap on here. It's NOT worth it - avoid and drive somewhere else.  TL;DR: don't come here if you like your bubble tea to be at a reasonable price. Really overpriced for everything."}
{"text":"The highlight of Destiny is that at 2am on weekends, the lights dim low and Japanese strippers descend on ropes from the ceiling. The high tables along the middle corridor become their dance floor. The overpriced bubble teas are replaced with tea pots full of sake and a separate \"menu\" with more exotic selections is circulated to male patrons.  JUST KIDDING  This place sucks.   Imagine sitting in a swanky nightclub setting with obnoxiously loud 1990s trance music blasting and an elaborate confusing menu of 180,000 different bubble teas and milkshake flavour combinations, most of which will cost you close to $10.   No booze available.  Slow service.  I'm surprised they don't charge cover."}
{"text":"First of all, I completely understand weekend nights are busy and hectic. I used to work as a waitress as well so I know it gets stressful and pretty much impossible to provide every customer with the best service. However, tonight I was utterly shocked with how my friends and I were treated. We had to ask for napkins three times to three different people, the ice matcha latte was completely watered down to the point we weren't even sure if there was matcha in it and when the server took it back to make it again, we didn't get it back for more than 20min. Here is the highlight of all this mess. By the fourth time asking for cups of water - we finally got them but with spit in it. Seriously? We were polite in asking at first but of course, when we had to ask so many times for something like water, we had to make our point by saying \"can we PLEASE have water.\" So just in case anyone is planning to head there in the near future, check your water cups because even at those busy times, they were able to take time to spit into our cups."}
{"text":"Haven't been there for years.  Came back and found out they've updated their menu.  Their dinner special seems okay.  Includes main dish a drink and ice cream dessert.   Seems quiet for night time though....  wonder what happened to them after the cockroach incident."}
{"text":"Nice place to hang out , chat and have dessert with group of people! Tried their dessert for the first time and it was great. Usually come here late at night to relax and have some light food or dessert. Service and wait time are good."}
{"text":"Ordered a large Brown Sugar Wintermelon Milk Tea with boba takeout for $7.65 tax included. Super expensive compared to other bbt franchise that is usually for $5.60. It's not like the drink was excellent.  From the name, you can really tell how sweet it is. It seems that everything is priced quite high here. I may come back to dine in to try their kitchen food but honestly kinda expect the quality of it from the drink somehow."}
{"text":"Looking for some mediocre bubble tea and a nice place to be? Look no further!  Love the décor here but, I can't say the same for their drinks. This place is very modern and spacious. It has great lighting and you can request for booths with outlets which makes it perfect for studying (minus the increasing noise level as the day progresses)! The staff is friendly however, not really attentive. During most of our visits, it took us around 20 mins to wave a server down to get our bill. Keep in mind that their degree of attentiveness decreases as the number of customers increases.   Their Strawberry Soda is a no-no. It looks appealing and tasty but honestly, it just tastes like club soda with a hint of strawberry jelly. So not worth your 5 or 6 dollars! Moving onto the Hazel Nut Latte. A sip of this drink has left me wondering if I had ordered a watered down coffee or a hazel nut latte... I can confidently say that I DID NOT taste ANY kind of hazel nut flavour in this drink and there goes another of my 5-bucks-not-worth-spending. Another disappointment award goes to.... the Red Bean Milk Tea! It tasted like red bean powder with an unbalanced ratio of milk and water. However, there was one red bean drink that I enjoyed for momentarily and that was the Red Bean Ice Cream drink. It tasted good for a couple of sips until it gave me a sugar rush as I continued to down this drink. Okay, I LOVE green tea and I thought, 'hey... what can possibly go wrong with a Milk Green Tea?' The verdict: it was pretty mediocre. There was only a hint of green tea flavour in the drink and it was laced with a good amount of sugar. I gave a stab at another green tea drink, Red Bean Iced Green Tea and that was wuite disappointing as well. The red bean topping was tasty however, the green drink itself was nothing more than a bottle of crushed ice. Well, there was one drink that I actually truly enjoyed and that was the Chrysanthemum Pu Erh Tea. It sounds like what it tastes.  Besides from the mediocre drinks, the food is pretty much on the same level as well. The popcorn chicken is not the best. It literally tastes like chicken pieces that are kept in the fryer for a bit too long. Ekk!  I'm not sure if they still have a lunch menu (since I've been only visiting in the late afternoon-evening recently), however, the food on that menu was pretty good. Recalling back to 4 years ago, their lunch menu gave you the option of choosing 4 or 5 items for around $10. These items consisted of assorted a coffee/tea, beef/fish balls, fish cakes/tofu cakes, slider of mini sandwiches and other various appetizers you'd find on their regular menu (it's just that they came in a smaller portion).  With all that being said, this is not the right place for you if you're looking for some tasty bubble tea and treats. But, if you are looking for a nice place to hang and don't mind the mediocre drinks and food, then by all means, please proceed."}
{"text":"Came here last night with a party of 20. Admittedly, I come here all the time and I'll also be the first to admit that its very average. But still, if you're uptown and driving, there aren't many places you can go past midnight.   Service is typical of any other bubble tea lounge, they take your order, bring it to you and then pretty much leave you alone until you track them down to get your bill. If it were any other place I would leave and never come back but its almost expectedly at these tea shops so I don't mind just lounging around for an hour or two without being interrupted. Generally the service staff is nice and just leave you on your own unless you need something.    The drinks are fine, I don't think they are as good as Chatime or Ten Ren's but I'm not a huge fan of tea anyways so its not a big deal for me. Generally the quality is consistent. Food is also not amazing but if you're out late and just want something to eat its passable. I'm guilty of ordering something I know will be subpar, but when its late and you're delusional, you become unreasonably optimistic that maybe this time will be different and the food will magically be better.   Overall its a nice place to casually hang out with some friends. They have comfy booths to lounge in downstairs and whenever we have a larger party over 20 like last night they give us a section upstairs and its a nice undisturbed space to chill so its fine for what we were looking for.   Never had any problems and its nice to have a laid-back and super casual place to meet friends when you're uptown."}
{"text":"I used to go to destiny a lot when I was younger, but stopped going last 10 years. I'm surprise this place is still surviving. I went during the day on a Saturday and there were a few families and quite a lot of students there studying. I would say the food and drinks are average, nothing amazing, but I guess it's a good alternative to a bar or a coffee shop. Not many places you can go with a bunch of friends and just chill and talk."}
{"text":"Came here last night after my friend and I found out that Go for Tea closed down -next closest place. I ordered a hot honey green tea and shared a plate of peanut butter French toast. Our drinks came immediately, but it took ~ 30min to make French toast - not a big deal in the grand scheme of things. The worst part was that 4hours after, I was vomiting - a case of food poisoning. How do you contaminate French toast or a hot honey tea? I'm never going back. I miss go for tea."}
{"text":"The bubble tea here is bleh. Tastes extremely water down.  The only reason I still come here is for the abundant seating and the ability to sit and talk with friends.  I ordered a cake here once and it was extremely freezer burned.  I used to come here for lunch specials with the Mrs. since it would include a bubble tea, but they have since removed that special.  The waitresses and waiters don't make rounds in this fairly large building, therefore you will wait for hours to get the bill or place your order."}
{"text":"The renovation looks great, though disappointed in the menu; it seems to be even more limited than it was before. Drinks are mediocre. The popcorn chicken was good but its hard to mess up anything deep fried. We did want to order more snacks but nothing appealed to us. Service was okay, no complaints.   Decent place to study/chill during late hours."}
{"text":"Not sure how this place is even getting 2 stars! Horrible I tell you. BEFORE this place was renovated and *probably* under different management, it was SO much better. This place is a disaster now!   First of all, we got seated and our waitress brings out water in glasses that had white or whatever nasty thing that was floating in it! We were so disgusted, we didn't want to be rude but told the waitress kindly that we did not want water. Also, she sadly did not know what a straw was that my boyfriend had to act it out in a nice way with a smile so she knew what it was. The language barrier made it tricky to ask for stuff and to place orders.  I got the mango smoothie with tapioca and he got the honeydew milk tea with lychee jelly. I didn't even know what to say. We did drink it (because it would've been a waste of money) but it was tasteless!! We got spare ribs and it was just ok, it was so thin and not flavoured well. It was just so disappointing.  I used to love coming here before they renovated, because the drinks, appetizers and dessert were so good!! Now it's so bad, and not only is this my opinion but a group of my coworkers who went said the same thing. Definitely never returning to this location.  P.S. when I used the machine to pay with my debit card the girl was WATCHING me type in all the details.. like seriously?"}
{"text":"Destiny is the ORIGINAL bubble tea house - having its signature East Beaver Creek plaza location for several years... Flash forward ten years and its failure to keep up with the newer bubble tea chains and houses is an utter disappointment. There's just nothing special about it. Sure, there's great decor, lots of space, and decent tasting food, but there's just not \"it\" factor that distinguishes Destiny from the rest (and I don't think the grossly overpriced drinks and dishes count... sorry but $10 for a cup of tea even makes Ten Ren's seem cheap).  The drinks are standard. There aren't any cool toppings are add-ins that make it unique. I'm pretty sure they still use powder for some of their bubble teas too - underwhelming given that most tea houses are opting for ACTUAL steeped tea these days.  Ambiance is nice. Incredibly spacious, and the seats are pretty comfortable. I can see why Destiny would be a Go-To place for large groups at night.  Menu is pricey, and the food isn't even that good. Most seem like microwave dinners to me. Even if some snacks are decently priced, the portion sizes are small and the bill can rack up if you are hungry.  TLDR: Destiny will always be the one and only original tea house... but I would definitely choose other places over it now in today's bubble tea revolution"}
{"text":"Bad service. Went during the evening for tea. there were only 4 tables seated but it still took me and boyfriend 15 mins to order our food. Hated the music. I prefer the destiny on Midland."}
{"text":"There is only one thing that has me coming back and that is their spicy popcorn chicken!! The waitresses are sometimes clueless and will tell you that it doesn't come in spicy flavour but they are wrong. They'll go to confirm with the kitchen and come back saying it's possible to order as spicy. The popcorn chicken is the only thing I find edible on the menu.   Their rice dishes are incredibly bland and I do not recommend them! The gyoza is mediocre but not worth paying for. I have tried to order their seafood pancake at least 5 times now and every time they say it is unavailable, might as well take it off the menu! I am not a fan of chatime at all and I like destiny's bubble tea 100x more. My go to is the taro tapioca slush!   This place also has the SLOWEST service I have ever seen. You could easily walk out without paying and no one would notice. I have waited so long for the bill that I often contemplate doing this. Ridiculous how difficult it is to wave someone down."}
{"text":"Been here about three times late evening to grab a bite and bubble tea but never got the chance to try the food. We were coming back from the cottage and a friend suggested to come here to get food as its supposedly a decent price for lunch. We came around noon and it wasn't that busy, we were situated near one of the left corners where most of the other diners were. As for service, they were a bit slow checking up on us whenever we needed a water refill etc (we were sitting behind some seated post lol- was hard to see I guess?) they had a wide selection of food and drinks but it was personally a bit more pricier then I anticipated.  I couldn't decide between the curry rice dish or the ramen (chose the ramen instead) because I was craving something soup base. Soup base, noodles, toppings were pretty generic - nothing special here how ever I did really like the fried chicken katsu.  As for the drink, I picked the rock candy \"soil\"  one because it just looked cool. Tasted alright nothing special either though the chocolate rock candy was pretty good.  Total bill was quite a bit for lunch so :/ not sure if I would come back on my own, only if someone wanted to meet up there then I'll go."}
{"text":"Dessert here is really good I love the cakes and the drinks too! Only problem here is that it's really overpriced, recently they jacked up their prices so I don't come here as much, sad it was a pretty good place."}
{"text":"I love the parking, decor, food, and ambiance of the place. We had the large bubble tea which was tasty and sampled some foods since we just wanted a snack. I really wish they had something like this back in the states!"}
{"text":"This place looks nicely decorated. Wifi is extremely slow (we are from Chicago and it would be nice to have internet access for Free) . We barely saw our waiter, which was fine, because we prefer to chill and be left alone.   I had the milk papaya hotpot - corn/papaya/veg were tasteless. Just a cool-looking pot over fire with bland milk and ingredients in it.  The banana smoothie tasted like powder?? (sadly, my husband thinks it's good). It's overpriced poor quality food.   Three stars goes to the ice cream fruit crepe- Very delicious and it was huge!!!  Ideally, it would be a cool hangover place if the food is more decent."}
{"text":"Amazing place to hang out with friends! Great for both small and large groups. Bubble tea is very good but a little bit pricey. Food is good as well. Service can be mediocre sometimes but the wait time us usually reasonable and ambience is great"}
{"text":"This place is my go to for bubble tea and their delicious waffles and ice cream.   Always very busy but service has always been fast for me.   They recently updated their menus and have added some more options which have me continually returning."}
{"text":"Haven't been back here in a while. Place seemed to be busier than before. Close to midnight and there's a line up. The food was mediocre. Drinks were not cold enough. Water took forever to come. Only 1 server in our section and it was packed. Waitress was really nice but that was all. Don't come here for great service."}
{"text":"Have been coming to Destiny many times for the past few years. They renovated again and have a new menu, so was excited to try it out! Came around 10pm on a Saturday, surprisingly was pretty empty and was seated very quickly. Ordered the Ferris Wheel Set, which came with baskets of fried food and two mango smoothies for my boyfriend and I. Our drinks came after 10 minutes, but  food seemed to take surprisingly long. Continuously saw other tables receiving their ferris wheel sets and we were still waiting. Asked who seemed was the manager how much longer our food would take, and he went to check. He stopped a server who was about to give the ferris wheel set to another table, went to the kitchen and came back out and we received it. Overall, other than the wait time, the ferris wheel set was yummy and filling for two people. Came the next night after with a few friends, and the service was horrible. The server gave us ONE napkin for a table of five, and had to ask for the bill three times before finally getting it after half an hour."}
{"text":"Newly renovated. Looks great. Lots of parking space. Food? ....hmnnnn...not really impressed. Expensive drinks."}
