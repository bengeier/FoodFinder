{"text":"Not too bad of an experience but I could have had better (both on my part and theirs). I came in for dinner time with my mom and my brother and we were soooo excited to try this place (Indian food lovers here). Now, it was partly my fault because I was a bit full from eating earlier that day but I also didn't really enjoy a few things about the food they served.  We were seated right away and that's always a plus in my books but it took quite a bit of time for our server to come to us. I know it's a buffet but I wanted us to get started with some drinks and look at special menu items to see whether or not we actually wanted to go for the buffet or not. The server came by soon and she was nice but not very engaging. I don't really blame her, she kinda just wanted to do her job right and get onto the next customer and she wasn't rude or anything, just bland for lack of a better word.   The decor inside is absolutely stunning. Really beautiful and quite difficult to put into words so I would really urge you to go there to check it out.  In terms of the food, it's kind of a hit or miss. All the food is fresh and hot and that's fantastic for me (I really cannot deal with lukewarm food lol) but flavours wise, some of the dishes just didn't do it for me. Indian food is all about hitting you with flavour so when some of the meat dishes (although they were nice and tender) didn't give me the flavour I was looking for, I was pretty disappointed.  Coming back to the problem of the server taking a while to get to us, it continued all throughout our visit. Took a while for plates to be cleared off so when I went to get dessert (and finished it), all of our main dish plates were still on the table. Dessert was also a hit or miss, but I would seriously recommend their gulab jamun.....ohhhhh my god it's good.  Overall, i've definitely had better in terms of the quality of the food but I wouldn't give it a complete miss. So I would try it but without expectations being too high!"}
{"text":"Came for lunch and enjoyed it. They had a decent variety of items, and the quality was pretty good. The food wasn't very spicy, but some of the desert items were very sweet.   The restaurant fills up quickly and getting to the buffet can be tricky if you're seated further from it. You will find yourself moving between tables and traffic going in the other direction.   The service was good and our servers checked on us periodically. However we did have to flag them down for refills.  Give it a shot, but be mindful of the price and the two hour seating limit."}
{"text":"Having read great things about Tandoori Flame, I decided to check it out with my wife.  It was a good meal, though I'd hesitate to call it great.  There's a good variety of food, and everything was well-stocked despite the restaurant being very busy while we were there.  My wife, who rarely eats Indian food, complained about the lack of English descriptions for the food - I didn't find this to be a big problem, but it did bother her not knowing what was in each dish, or how spicy it should be.  The food was lacking in flavour compared to other Indian places i've frequented.  It wasn't entirely bland, but it definitely wasn't what I'd have hoped for.   To my surprise, they had pizza available, which seemed like it'd be a great choice for my children - sadly, it tasted like ketchup slathered on a thick sheet of cardboard.  Still, the kids ate it, and if you go to an Indian buffet to eat pizza, I'd have to question your culinary priorities.  Overall, the experience was good.  Our waitress came by periodically to check on us and refill drinks, and we all ate our fill.  If I were looking for a decent Indian place that's well-located, I'd come here again."}
{"text":"QUality of food has gone down since Maninder took over as Manager. Poor food with too much cream. If you want to stay healthy, avoid this place. MSG filled, reheated food with poor customer service from the staff as well.   The only good thing is the ambiance is nice!"}
{"text":"Can chicken be both dry, overcooked and taste like it's not cooked? Tandoori Flame can make it that way! The food is bland, the service is awful and you'd be happier going somewhere else."}
{"text":"Tandoori Flame is a place where me and my family all enjoy going. The decor is just amazing and everything is very modern and clean with touches of traditional pieces. The food is excellent although \"some\" of the waiters seem a bit lost sometimes. They tend to hang around near the dishes doing nothing and I've noticed this quite a few times, and when the bill is ready, come running over to get their tip. Overall, the atmosphere is really nice and the food is just amazing. I highly recommend this buffet to everyone and is definitely worth the trip."}
{"text":"Excellent food . you should try the butter chicken that is my son's favorite dish. For new the tandoori chicken is also a must. Good for a Friday evening dinner. You will feel like in India even though I haven't been there."}
{"text":"On the prowl for awesome Indian buffets. Found this place.  What's so great about it: clean, good service, incredible variety/selection Not that great: you can find better quality elsewhere Not to say that it's bad by any-means- it was great! It's just that this is the place where their variety is what carries them above other biffets. I highly recommend."}
{"text":"Food quality not the best, but quit good The diversity of food, salads, dessert, sides makes me give them the 4-star"}
{"text":"Perhaps this is because I'm on an empty stomach, but I have some very fond memories of this place. I actually love this place now! Loads of options and most are generally tasty!"}
{"text":"High end buffet price - low end buffet quality.  Came in with a group of 4 for weekend dinner. Sign posted in front says 2 hour limit - they gave us the bill about 80 minutes into our meal. Then said we couldnt split the bill. Ummm huh?! How hard is it to just charge per person.   Dessert table was beyond pathetic - for the price I was expecting more authentic indian sweets, not cheap store bought cookies, cakes, and ice cream.   Get rid of the sad and cheap pizza, fries, spring rolls, onion rings ect and have more variety of biryani, pakoras, samosas (one they had tasted like cheap frozen ones you get in stores) or even have an hakka-indian section if you want to branch out of the traditional indian food.   The naan was actually really good - but Im not paying 30$ to fill up on naan. Decent amount of curry options ..but it gets repetitive after you go through them all. Outside of the curry bar - your options are limited. I meant they had a buffet tray...for KETCHUP.   For 120$ between 4 ppl, your better off going to an fine dining indian cuisine - get the same amount of food, better quality, for way less $.   To leave on a positive note, the waitress were nice though. Quick for water fill ups and removing dishes."}
{"text":"The Boston Pizza of Indian food - I'd give it less than one star if that were  possible. Food might be tolerable but it's only been an hour and my stomach is unsure . If it were cheap I'd be more forgiving."}
{"text":"We visited Tandoori Flame on Tuesday night. Walking in, I was impressed with the decor and the design of the restaurant. It's a little trendy, but at the same time, you can see a little touch of India here and there. Similar to the Mandarin Buffet in Brampton, they have a couple dining rooms that could be used for private functions as well.   All the waiters and waitresses are very polite and helpful.   Because it was a Tuesday night, I was afraid the food selection wouldn't be that great, but I really had nothing to compare to and we were in the mood to try something new. Looking back at the reviews on their Brampton location, it seems the food selection here is not as great. There were about 8 different meat/seafood dishes, 7 vegetarian dishes, a couple biryani choices, a salad/pasta bar and desserts. There was also plain naan, samosas, pizza and fries.   Having Indian buffet was a nice experience where we got to try a lot of new things because we always take the safe route and order tandoori chicken, butter chicken or chicken curry for takeout. Other than chicken tikka masala, I haven't really added anything new to my list, but all the chicken dishes were very juicy and flavourful. However, I found the naan to be way too greasy...too thin and crispy (I like naans that are more fluffy and chewy).   I felt the desserts were nothing too special. There's ice cream, fruits, cake, baklava, and a several Indian desserts. Unfortunately, they didn't have gulab jamun that night! The mango custard sort of made up for it though...but I wasn't very fond of the other Indian desserts.  I will come back, but considering I really only like tandoori chicken, butter chicken and chicken curry, I'd save myself a bit of money and have lunch buffet instead."}
{"text":"Finally decided to try this place a few days ago. After much anticipation, the experience was a major let down. At first the decor looks amazing and inviting until they tried to sit us at an extremely dirty leather bench. They all looked dirty. We found a nice simple table and tried to over look the mess. The buffet is one station of basic Indian food plus pizza (porquoi) and a salad station. The food was not bad but definitely not good. Very simple and underwhelming. The naan was lovely though but everything was boring on the palette.   The service consisted of one woman racing by our table three times. We barely caught what she was saying as she was speeding by. She didn't stop once to properly greet us.   I didn't even have seconds cause I couldn't wait to get out of there. Oh for those of you who care about cleanliness please avoid this place. The open parts of the kitchen was filthy, imagine what can't be seen. My only regret was not taking a picture to prove my point. All human thumbs down."}
{"text":"I think they're best in town for continental food. So much food to pick so much variety to choose from :)! The service is good you don't have to worry about the cold drinks as the server will ask you as soon as you get the plates to the table :). If you go for lunch that's $13 per person. And if you go for dinner it's $30 plus tax so yeah. It's a must try you won't regret :)"}
{"text":"I went here with some friends Tuesday night. Oh how I regret that decision now. Our server was unattentive and unfriendly. The deep fried appetizers were cold and I'm pretty sure the samosas were originally frozen.   The only redeeming factor was the wide selection of various curries. They tasted pretty good too! The naan bread was greasy and chewy though...ew.  The worst part of my experience here was the food poisoning I got for the next two days. One of my friends from that night also got terrible food poisoning. I will never be returning!!"}
{"text":"It's a fair deal.  The food tastes great, and the quality is consistent. My family and I visit this place regularly, and its a pleasure to see the pride of ownership as they are always renovating and improving the facility.  Make sure you're hungry!!!"}
{"text":"We love Tandoori Flame, although we normally opt for take out. The flavours are excellent for the various curies and the veggie pakoras are awesome. Sometimes the meat in the takeout butter chicken is a little skimpy...otherwise, perfection."}
{"text":"Excellent delicious food with alot of varieties as well as nice friendly staff just note that prices are exchanged  16 for launch weekdays 21 for dinner weekdays  21 for lunch weekends 25 for Dinner weekends"}
{"text":"Worst Indian Food we ever had. Good variety of dishes are offered but none tasted good, and I tried all, hoping the next may turn out good so the money I'm spending on the dinner (definitely over-priced for that sorry fare). Who puts lemon (and so much lemon) in Karhi Pakora !! Kharoda soup and Hot n Sour soups had no taste at all. Even Tandoori chicken was a so-so. Ambience not authentic though, but may be good. Having said that I go to a restaurant for food. And I am never going back and have already told my friends to avoid eating there.  On top of the food quality, service was really not good-- the water glass which I got first had lipstick stain on it !! Service was slow considering servers were only serving drinks not food. Such a waste of money and time"}
{"text":"This place, like its veg competitor offers a huge variety of dishes.  However, despite the variety, the individual dishes themselves are subpar and nothing special. You can have a few amazing dishes or lots of okay dishes. I'd go for the first option.   This place is good for those who want a taste of everything and don't mind under seasoned food.   Service is so-so.  Ambience is lively, it does get extremely busy."}
{"text":"My experience was positive. Staff is great and food is good. Really enjoyed their Goat Curry and Tandoori Chicken. It is a little pricey for my taste however enjoyed the restaurant."}
{"text":"People had a good review about this restaurant in brampton.  I wanna check it out myself, so went there with my colleagues yesterday and was so disappointed.  First of all the service was very bad & the food was even worse. Starting from appetizers until the desert everything has no taste at all. I would not mind if I have paid a resealable price for the buffet but $28 for this kind of food and service is not acceptable at all. On top of that to make it the worst they charged me $2.50 for gratuity. Worst experience ever. Never ever gonna recommend to any known people."}
{"text":"I did not go in with very high expectations. But the pani puri and the lahori chana were enough to blow me away. The Punjabi food was out of this world. The biryani was below average and the pav bhavi was average. Punjabi food was pure heaven. I can still feel it lingering."}
{"text":"Went with a group of 40 + people   Were told that we would have to pay for 50 people to use the room and we agreed.  To our suprise they charged us for all adults instead of lower price for kids.  Waitress and cashier were not ready to hear anything and so we paid   Great place but unfortunately extremely bad interpersonal skills  Anyone going in big group beware.  Take everything in writing"}
{"text":"Food was disappointing. Host was rude. Not recommended as there are better Indian food choices in the area. Very pricey for a sub par Indian buffet."}
{"text":"The ambiance is good . The place has a good variety of Buffet."}
{"text":"If I were giving stars based solely on the variety, selection and quality of the food, Tandoori Flame would get 5 stars.  Two thumbs up to the kitchen staff; every time I've eaten here the food has tasted fantastic, and considering the enormous buffet selection they offer, that's impressive.  And although I've never tried any of the cocktails, their cocktail menu offers a long list of creative, tantalizing-sounding beverages.  Apart from that, there is a lot of room for improvement at this restaurant, and it's all in the details.  Management, I hope you read this because with some minor fixes and more attention to detail you could have a fantastic, 5-star establishment.  Here's what needs to be changed: - your entrance is beautiful with all the hanging potted plants, but you need to take the price tags off the plants.  That looks tacky. - when your staff cleans a table, make sure they do a thorough job.  For example, the table the hostess guided me to had crumbs all over the booth seat which I had to clean off myself. - hire more staff or encourage your waiters to move faster so they don't leave clientele sitting waiting to order a drink for several minutes. - When your waiters serve a drink, they should make sure the glass is clean.  In my case, the waiter brought me a cup of masala chai which had chai dripping all over the side of the class.  Sloppy.  (It tasted good though.) - Have sugar available at all the tables; don't make your customers have to ask for it. - The hand drier in the women's washroom is broken.  Either fix it or provide paper towels. - And most importantly - this is what irks me the most - your restaurant has wifi, yet you refuse to offer the code to customers.  That's just plain rude.  I don't know what your reasoning behind this is, but to do so is ridiculous in this day and age and makes it pretty obvious that your primary goal is not customer satisfaction. I sincerely hope Tandoori Flame implements these changes because I would love to see it thrive and stay around for a long time."}
{"text":"The food was amazing, I don't know why people have a bad reviews  UPDATE: Now I know why it has bad reviews, I went the second time on Wed (kids is free day) and the quality was very bad compare to the first visit....Food was just not the same, even the ice cream not the same, you could tell they lowered the quality because kids is free day...For me that's cheating and I don't like cheaters"}
{"text":"My first time here and not a big Indian foodie but I can say food was excellent and would definitely come again, was busy for a monday night now I know why  because of the good food. Would definitely recommend this place if you like Indian food or want to try something new."}
{"text":"Have been frequenting this place since a few years now. But my recent visit was a real dampener. Like every establishment, they've become too complacent with their success & their food quality is spiralling downwards. More than half the items on the buffet were cold. Their food wasn't fresh at all and it had a particular smell. This place really needs to figure out what's going on their kitchen."}
{"text":"Visited Tandooro Flame on mother's day, great food really liked chicken BBQ, Papars, Gool Gappe..Service is really quick. Our server was Karishma who was really courtieous and helped us making right choices for the food."}
{"text":"I've tried this location for a few years. Always hoping it would get better than the Brampton location. It's ok but never has managed to hit that sweet spot the Brampton location has.  Now I give two stars where I would normally give 3 on this, and that is cause of price. This place for what you get is WAYYYYYYYY too over price. They need to nock down each adult price by 10$ -  the food is ok, but is not near 30$ a person on a weekend ok.  They have of course a good number of veggie dishes, all good. But for this price, go to the Brampton location it is worth the money."}
{"text":"Great buffet selection for vegetarians. Service is good, ambiance is OK. It seems to be quite noisy and expect lots of families with lots of children.   Buffet is priced well, drinks are reasonable. If you don't like spicy food, be cautious, many of the hot dishes are quite spicy!   Not as good of a selection as the Brampton location, but there is enough on the menu to suit your whole party.   Will come back. Will recommend."}
{"text":"BEWARE - I must say I was rather disappointed at this restaurant.  Food wasn't bad but the service was terrible.  I went with a group of colleagues during lunch and when we got the bill, gratitude was automatically added to our bill (which was fine), but the waiter didn't say anything and when we asked for separate bills (there was a group of 10 people), he just told us the total amount which was $17+.  For those that was paying cash, he asked do you need any change back, so automatically we think we should also tip and most just gave $20.  We realized the next day that tips was already included and why would he even ask whether we need any change back, and he didn't even mentioned that tips was already included. So each of us pretty much tip around 30%+.  That is just dishonest and I hope he is not doing that for other customers.  The waiter never even smile once throughout the dining experience.  They need to replace someone else that is more honest and friendly.  I hope management knows this."}
{"text":"this place has the worse food ever, even the waiters  agreed with me. The kheer was made out  from water instead of milk, the food was no where close to being called indian, pakistani or punjabi; or even food for that matter. Please dont go, expensive and bad. Really bad"}
{"text":"The original - haven't been here in a year, but went way too many times to count. Food is always amazing, servers are good and deal well with such a busy place. Great for groups, they always have fresh good food and it's yummy as hell. Perfect for vegetarians, lots of good choices."}
{"text":"Best buffet that we have been to in Toronto till now. Quite a huge variety of dishes, excellent ambiance and service and great value for money. Will definitely go there again."}
{"text":"Been here twice and i love it! Great for family buffet and also if you are a fan of indian cuisine. Definitely one of the best indian buffet with lots to choose from."}
{"text":"Bribing for reviews with coupons .. Mothers day lunch for ten people. 45 minutes to get water to our table. There were 2 servers for.about 150 people sitting in our section.  The food was bland or sweet... not well made authentic. The sambar and dosa were terrible. The biryani rice were all broken grains.$25 per person for poor food plus drinks and slow service. Plus they came and offered a 25%discount off the next visit if we gave them a review on yelp right then that they could see.. so bribing for reviews. Floors by the kitchen and food were slippery with food and oil... saw three people almost slip. We arent going back again."}
{"text":"Food was amazing,  but unfortunately the service ruined the experience for my husband and I.  We had to ask the bus boy for a refill because the waitress just didn't check with us after our first drink.  Once we were finished at our table we patiently waited for the bill and even after making eye contact with her several times she still didn't come over.  She was setting tables and still didn't even come over.  The restaurant had very few ppl there...  Another issue we had was how icy outside of the Restaurant was; It has been raining all day with below zero temperatures. I don't think a little salt down is too much to ask."}
{"text":"Great Indian food. Everything is high quality, and they aren't afraid to serve spicy food. Yes I know Indian people won't find it spicy, but I'm white and compared to the bland Chinese, Italian and American buffets on the market, this place is spicy. Great value, esp for lunch.  There are a few areas where they could improve. There are long waits on weekends, but the restaurant isn't full - some sections are closed. Additional staff are needed. It would also help if they took reservations. Although the food is great, the selection is so-so. They advertise as North America's largest Indian buffet, and while I don't know if that is true, it is hardly a difficult title to claim. Regardless, the number of items is artificially inflated by including sauces and other things, so the total number of dishes is not as great as it should be. Other dishes are very similar to each other in taste or composition. So I end up not experiencing as much of a variety as I would expect from a large buffet. That said, it is bigger and more varied than any other Indian buffet I've seen in the GTA - just not enough to hit 5 stars."}
{"text":"High end buffet. Went there today and I honestly was blown away. This place is so clean, has delicious food, and the decor is beautiful. The food was hot, fresh and delicious. The tandoori chicken, butter chicken, naan, pani puri and just the huge variety. Very cheap for what you're receiving and a great deal!! I am looking forward to my next visit."}
{"text":"Great indian food with a large selection. Everything is tasty. My favourite is the butter chicken and the lamb  curry, amazing taste. My hat off to the chef. Desserts are equally good which includes sweets, fruits, ice cream, cakes etc. This is the best dine in buffet indian restaurant in Mississauga."}
{"text":"This is one of the Best Indian Buffet in Southern Ontario. Better than Toronto, North York, Markham and Richmond hill.  Number of variety food are a few to ten times more compare to others.  Reasonable price, clean, nice service and I like their interior design as well.  You won't be disappointed for sure."}
{"text":"Buffett choice is amazing we can start with gol gupas and chaat papri and go all the way with vegetarian and meat dishes. BBQ is really good especially there fish. Wined up with desserts.  Definitely favourite place to go with your family and friends."}
{"text":"There weren't many options to the things i could eat there, and so much of the food was basically the same.  Also It was hard to get some good customer service there. Overall it wasn't a great dining experience for me."}
{"text":"First and foremost: I love this place.  I'm a huge fan for very simple reaons, Tandoori Flame knows what is important to its customers: food, service and layout.   Tandoori Flame has a lot of options, like more than 20+ food choices for desserts. As someone who has grown up around Indian cuisine, this is very important as we love to have multitudes of flavors thrown at us: Tandoori Flame delivers.   The service here is impeccable, Tandoori Flame has staff that are always smiling and happy to help you with any of your needs. This is super important when they're navigating the cavernous seating area trying  to meet everyone's needs.   The layout of Tandoori Flame is simply elegant. They keep everything simple enough so that you can focus on your food and guests, but offer enough tidbits of  clutter so that you can spark conversations about \"the random things\" around the store with your guests.   The one BIG reason that Tandoori Flame will not begetting a 5-star rating is because their seating area is a bit cluttered. Given the right set of circumstances (which happen quite often), the line to get to the food can be bottle-necked through a very small hallway. Half the people are going to their seats and the other half are leaving them, resulting a bit of pandemonium.   TL;DR: Great food, great service with a bit of process flow problems. Come here and enjoy the food, just be ready to wait in line a little."}
{"text":"Horrible, all the curries watered down. I usually look forward to Palak paneer at Indian Restaurants and this one was so runny and tasteless. Lamb curries was rock hard and mainly pieces of bones. This place got 1 star only for the entertainment."}
{"text":"What a let down! the food was not worth the price at all and service was slow. All the curries tasted the same and the desserts looked so un-appetizing couldn't even bring myself to try them, the \"kheer\" was grey coloured and so thin it could be mistaken for soup, I survived on naan and salad the only good items in a buffet claiming to have \"150 items\"... I've been there once before a few months  ago and remember it being better so maybe they cut down on the variety or something overall felt like a complete rip off, this kind of buffet is not worth more than 9.99 please don't waste your money, would not recommend or go back"}
{"text":"Worth visiting once if you are damm hungry. The variety they have in their buffet is no match to others. Though its on the higher side on price but worth trying once if you are a fan of Indian food."}
{"text":"Good to visit if you are too hungry and you dint had your previous meal. The variety of food is amazing. Quality is also good. Though being on a little higher side on price but worth trying once"}
{"text":"Wonderful dining experience. Excellent decor, food and service. .paisa wasool . Made mother's day more special for me n my family"}
{"text":"Went twice in 2 weeks!  We love it there because you can try bits and pieces of things that you may not have the guts to try at a restaurant (and pay $14.99 for something you may or may not like).   The first time we went the naan was amazing, regular style and garlic.  The second time we went, the naan was really dense and very chewy.  We asked the naan chef where the garlic naan was and he said he would make us a fresh batch---what a difference!!!  Hot and fresh, soft and savoury.    The dessert and salad stations were the least interesting to me, but everything else was fantastic.  Pace yourself, go slow and enjoy!  FYI Wednesdays kids eat free!  Get there before 7 pm to avoid a line!"}
{"text":"I love this place! Best indian buffet I have ever been privileged to eat at."}
{"text":"I went here last night and wasn't too impressed. I had to wait in line to get a table. When I got the table, I realized there were still numerous empty tables. So not sure if they make people line up to make it seem busy or whether they just don't have enough people seating guests.   The food was ok and the options were limited (compared to the Brampton location). For example, the only non-Indian item here was pizza. So if you're coming with fussy children, they may not have many options. All they had for appetizers was mini samosas/chaat/gol guppa and some tandoori meats/kebabs. Even the mains weren't as numerous as I would expect.  Also, they have a dholi + bhangra dancers that make their rounds. It's very frequent and very loud. The dancers also approach you to join them. I understand that they are trying to create a dinner/entertainment atmosphere but I don't think a buffet is the place to do it. Or it could be less frequent/shorter performances. Another down side is that they block the way to the buffet when they are performing.  On the other hand, the decor is very nice and the service is very friendly.  My non-Indian friend enjoyed it but those of us that were Indian weren't that impressed."}
{"text":"This is the second location of Tandoori Flames. Its nothing like the original Tandoori Flames in Brampton. Being a buffet style resturant they do have a huge selection of items.  So having that great experience in my head we thought we should try this new location in Mississauga. Unfortunately the experience was not up to the point that we expected.  When we were going to be seated the server didn't even bother to give a tour or show us where are the washrooms or serving plates. I had to go look for the washroom.  The chicken was dry. Most of the main course dishes felt like made from frozen or boxed containers.   Soup was cold and there were no spoons. A server came but left after putting the soup bowls and didn't care for asking guests if they were looking for something.  when we were seated non of the servers came for some time.  Most of the cooks or the servers were eating in the same room where your guests were eating.  Some of the items were not refilled for some time. For instance I had to wait for a while to get chill chicken that was not refilled eventually I had to leave it.  The server who was refilling water spilled water on the table and left without saying or bother cleaning it.  After seeing all this we just left. I feel that the management in not up to the mark. Honestly I won't recommend this location to all my friends and family. One thing I would recommend is by the end of the have separate room for your server's and cooks to eat rather than having them sit where your guests are eating.  I won't recommend this place to my friends and family members."}
{"text":"Found a plastic bottle rim in my salad!!! I brought this to the attention of the manager and waiter and they had a rehearsed response of ''we make food for a large group of people and this will happen\". They were unapologetic and felt that excuse would suffice. They didn't offer to pay for our meal and their standard response gave away the fact that this possibly happens quite frequently. This is unacceptable and this has to be stopped. I asked them what if a child had choked on it and they seemed completely unfazed. They seem to think that just because they cater to a large group of people that they don't have to worry about few unhappy customers. My husband and I walked away having lost our appetite."}
{"text":"Disappointed with the service and the quality of food. It tasted like they just added more water to the curry to increase the quantity. Even the chicken pieces were highly suspect. There are way better places for Indian food in Mississauga."}
{"text":"The friendly atmosphere and open space doesn't feel like your being pressured to leave as soon as your done eating. Good place for family get together ' because of that. Food is not extraordinary but it's tasty enough for you to come back to. 3.5/5"}
{"text":"though it's a large indian buffet, most of the dishes it offers up are not 100% all indian per say.. like the salad bar, pizza, onion rings, and fruits.   there was more indian dishes than lets say the host in markham.  decor was nice, but some parts unfinished like the waterfall wall in the front, and some remnants of reno work in the dining room areas.   sexy looking bar area, look very dark even in daytime,  very justapose to the main dining room.   interesting pictures throughout of framed bollywood actors with a little blurb about them.   the food was alright, not anything different from what I've seen elsewhere except for additions of some hakka selections and sauteed vegetables. because of it's sheer number of selections and alright food quality, it's a-ok 3 stars in my books and worth checking out if you're in Brampton."}

{"text":"Great first experience, second experience we all got sick.  So needless to say I will not be going back."}
{"text":"I ended up in Bramalea a few times recently that saw me needing to have dinner, and as my reviews show, I enjoy indulging in Indian, so after having an experience at Bombay Palace, I thought I should try the other buffet up the road.  I was not as impressed here as I was at Bombay Palace.  The buffet was larger, with a vaster selection, but there were downfalls.  Started as customary with a mango lassi. It was too thick. Thankfully there was ice in it, which as melted, thinned the consistency.  Moving on to the apps, there was a nice display and variety. Samosa, pakora, salads and papadum. But unfortunately for my child, all contained a level of spice too hot for a child. I saw chilli peppers in all these, although I enjoyed, my son could only chew papadum for this part of the meal.  Moving on to the mains, the selection was large. Larger than Bombay Palace, but, none were labeled for spice level. (Medium hot/hot/extremely hot) knowing what should and should not be is one thing, but noticing chilli's simmering in the saag paneer, one of my almost six year olds favourite dishes, I had to tell him there was none. Near all the dishes had a level of hot to them, mind you I enjoy, but it was not child friendly at all. Sure they had pizza and fries available for children, bit some children (like mine) actually enjoy curries. The shahi paneer and butter chicken were mild enough for him, but no channa, or dahl. As well, this buffet featured goat, not Lamb. I would prefer not to worry about bones. The chicken curries, used the cheaper cuts (leg/thigh) while the cost  was 20% higher than Bombay Palace who used breast meat in their curries. Finally I tried the biryani here, and like the remainder of my meal it was disappointing. The mint content was absolutely overwhelming, rendering me incapable of finishing the portion I served myself.  Deserts were plentiful, mango or pistachio ice cream with the  norms, plenty of sweets. No complaints here.  Generally I felt the food to be generic, it didn't tickle my palate, I could easily do a better job at home, but that is defeatist to the point of going out, and unfortunately my child was limited in his selection, due to an overall overuse of chilli/cayenne and peppers.  Would I return, perhaps if my son was not with me, but the odds of being in Bramalea, without him for dinner are relatively slim, so it may be a few years before I would entertain the thought of trying this place again."}
{"text":"Complained about December 2017 birthday dinner buffet 4 people [Brampton] and manager agreed to call back with complimentary for 2 to try buffet in Mississauga. He never called with comps. He substantiated the complaint and then did nothing. Brampton buffet is downhill from what it was in 2017 and 2016. Really less quality. Less everything. Clearly less customer service."}
{"text":"- Decor, cleanliness and Customer Service is amazing - Huge selection of dishes - Consistency and Quality of the food is not as good as the Brampton's Location"}
{"text":"Went here for dinner with family and must say place is good, crowded and nice ambience. Very inviting but unfortunately food is not tasty at all. They quality is fine but taste is not. Correct for guest who prefers quantity over quality. Just not us. Won't go back."}
{"text":"Although I can find better places for a Indian food, I end up visiting this place few times becoz of variety avail here on one stage. You will find both North Indian and South Indian food here ( south Indian food taste is not upto the mark as they are not specialist).   Good thing about this place is you can see all food and make your choice."}
{"text":"Great place for indian punjabi style food. Have a decently priced takeaway menu."}
{"text":"This place is such a disaster, I can sum it up with the following few sentences:  -  Largest buffet in the GTA? Why do Indian restaurants have to lie to gain a competitive advantage? No it is not the largest its just average imo  - The business took a strict quantity over quality strategy... 95% of the food tastes marginal if not below average...The food is so blatantly rushed to be prepared in mass quantities, that you can taste more oil in the curries than flavor - I literally had to take a paper towel to dab out oil out of one of the meat curries I had #Ridiculous  - Sure the decor is nice, but I didn't pay an arm and a leg to eat crappy food and have a \"contemporary or modern?\" debate.  Let's just say the best thing abt the place is the outside architectural design - which Tuckers Marketplace actually had designed, and Tandoori Flame just created an eyesore in the middle of the Mavis and Britannia intersection, by placing that huge tacky Indian writing on the sides  If you really want to impress guests or want to take your family to an actual \"upscale\" Indian restaurant in Mississauga, go to The Host by Square One"}
{"text":"It probably is one of the biggest Indian buffet that I've seen in GTA. I like the food and the spice level and the options that are available. Their tandoori chicken and aloo tikki are my favorites here.  I also like the pani puri and papdi chaat that they serve. Along with that there are some sections with pasta/pizza/noodles/manchurian and they all taste good. Some of their salads too are alright. My only issue with this place is that along with being a restaurant, they also have a banquet hall in the same complex. People who host/attend parties in that banquet hall should ideally be served their food in their section. But unfortunately, that is not that case. So you have a hell lot of people trying to line up for the food in the common food section. It can get really frustrating when you have to stand in a long queue everytime you get up to get another serving for yourself. The place gets really congested. For that reason only, I and my friends totally avoid going to this place these days."}
{"text":"Huge selection of Indian food with Canadian/American items such as salad bar, ice cream, and pizza. Clean restaurant & friendly staff. Largest Indian buffet i ever been too."}
{"text":"Tandoori Flame never dissapoints when it comes to overall food variety, However Dessert section needs improvement more variety, Also on busy days you will have to wait patiently for Naan."}
{"text":"I am in Love the best place ever. Great food and food bar is always full and fresh. There is so much to choice from. $12.99 for lunch is a great deal."}
{"text":"Lot of options. More than we can try. Quality is good too. Ambience is great. Overall awesome dining experience"}
{"text":"On weekend getaway came here in Toronto area. Buffet on Saturday evening... And also they claim running a street food festival...So we gave a try, place look ok. Nothing special all regular items. Food was bit spicy for me,it can be personal taste but sure missing Real Indian taste.  Good thing... We like desserts. Masala tea was for extra$2 Overall giving them 3 cuz... They are allredy in that category."}
{"text":"Only been here once on my trip to Toronto but I was pleasantly surprised. We got there about 30 mins after opening for the lunch buffet on a Saturday and so seating was no issue we were 6 and got a great place. The decorations inside were very pretty, I liked it a lot. We were close to the buffet and the selection was big. There was a lot of choice and the food tasted great. They have a good selection of deserts and fruits. Only downside was some of the fruits like oranges had gotten dry and the strawberries were very sour. The waitress was very friendly but not much of a smile to show and we never had to wait to get water or to have our dishes get picked up which was great. All in all the place is a very good Indian buffet, considering the price too and the selection."}
{"text":"My first time at this restaurant was last Saturday Jan 23. My first impression on the service was excellent. Staff smiled and appeared genuinely wanting to please.  The food was very tasty and there was a lot to choose from.  My only disappointment was the tandoori chicken which was undercooked. However as soon as I pointed it out they immediately took action to remove all the tandoori chicken. It was later replaced with well cooked version. I would go back to this restaurant."}
{"text":"Huge selection of Indian Food. I really like their dessert choices until my last visit. Some staff members are really nice and some are really rude. It is pricier than most other places."}
{"text":"Nice decor, spacious,good service...lots of dishes in buffet however i found more than 60% of their food lacking authentic flavours especially the tandoori starters...not even close to the original tandoori taste plus its not freshly made either...ive had food here on wknds n weekdays....it was avg on wknd however below avg on weekdays.. heavily buttered curries makes it hard to distinguish btw the  dishes...blant salad bars...did like the freshly made tandoori naan n rotiz..n the freshly baked pizza plus few items in dessert n dats it really!!"}
{"text":"My entire family feels sick now. We all regret coming here. The experience was also quite poor, cups were empty, plates were left on the table, and staff wasn't very friendly (until it came time to tips that is). Avoid!"}
{"text":"good buffet, chaat and pani puri are not good. non veg items are good.  go on weekdays when it is cheaper."}
{"text":"My wife and I were here for dinner tonight and each had a variety of dishes from the buffet, all of which were very good.  My only complaint was that the Tandoori Chicken was slightly bland and the Chicken Curry was bone in (we usually prefer boneless meat, especially in curry).  While we love Indian food, we are not a fan of Indian deserts so we're pleased that there was a variety of non-Indian deserts as well (which were delicious by the way). We look forward to stopping by next time we are in the GTA."}
{"text":"We did a family dinner buffet on a friday night.  wasn't too busy, so we got a table quickly.  The service was reasonable, but could have been a bit better.  The food selection was good and they seemed to keep the trays refreshed..  i tried some of the chicken appetizers and though they were ok, a bit dry (the tandoori and haryali).  Overall the food was good but not that flavourful.  I like that the selection was great.  from chaat papri and gol guppa to veg and non veg dishes and some pizza/spring rolls for the less adventurous.  the salad and fruit bar were also well stocked and desserts werent bad.  Comments: - chicken was dry - semia was not sweet enough - gulab jamun was too sweet - nimbu pani (salty)was very sour  - selection was great - overall food tast was ok - some items were really good like he chaat papri  also, was a little pricey at $21/adult ($20 for seniors).  Kids are cheap - junior was $10 and child was $2..  but it still added up.  I don't know if it was worth the cost...  But there aren't that many indian buffets so what can you do.  I still prefer a-la-carte but its not a terrible choice."}
{"text":"It was very busy tonight! But that's no surprise...8pm on a Saturday night.  We got seated faster than expected. We were told up to 20 Minutes, got seated in about 10. Food was pretty good. Service wasn't great but got a little better towards the end (when busy-ness was dying down).  We sat at our table for about 5 seconds just to drop off our coats and got food right away so we didn't really give the waitress a chance yet to greet us. BUT when we sat with our first plate, we noticed we had no knives and didn't get greeted until we were almost done eating....not cool. Finally we got our water when we finished our first plate. Our first empty plates weren't picked up until we were almost done our second one. Aaaaand our water was never refilled, we had to get another waitress' attention. Our original waitress never came back to check up on us until we were ready to pay. And not until then was she giving us a little more attention and being nice. I get it...it's busy...I'm a pretty patient person but c'monnnnnnnn. And we noticed the manager standing around a few times just delegating....it would be nice if he could help his employees....  Sooo service wasn't so good.   I would've rated them a 2 but the food was good enough to bump it up one more! It was really busy but they were able to top up the food which made every batch fresh. Rice was cooked perfectly, chicken cooked all the way through with great flavours, fish pakora was crunchy and everything looked fresh and clean!   I'll probably visit again in the future (I love Indian food and this is close enough to home) so we'll how it goes next time!"}
{"text":"Indian Buffet with amazing quality food!  Indian buffets aren't hard to find, but no other does it better than Tandoori Flame.  This place is huge, fit for any family gathering. The choices: truly endless.   There is so much more than curries here at Tandoori Flame.  It's honestly a great way to experience Indian cuisine without ordering the entire menu at a restaurant. from curries, to pakora, to pani puri, samosas.... the list goes on!  Everythig I tried I liked!  The food is fresh, flavourful, wholesome and delicious.  I would say it's a must try if you love Indian."}
{"text":"I like variety and this place is ALL variety.  I would tell you how many different dishes they offer, but I can only count to 10 in Hindi (I kid you not) and gave up after that.  Weird decor.  Not sure what this place used to be, but the colours and finishes do not suit an Indian restaurant.  It kinda looks like they took over a previous restaurant (maybe Mexican?) and just put a new sign on the place.  Perhaps they purposely chose these colours, but I'm not a fan.  The food, however, is amazing.  I really wanted to try absolutely everything offered, but my stomach wasn't big enough.  Although it was busy on a weekend evening, it never took long to grab food.  The food was replenished quickly if it ever got low.  It was also so busy that nothing ever sat for too long, so it was all very fresh.  While I like being served at a restaurant (I'm a snob) I think getting up and walking a bit between each plate is a good idea.  It definitely helps you pace yourself.  Plus, as already mentioned, I like being able to try lots of different dishes, rather than just ordering one or two dishes.  Great for groups.  Lots of seating.  There were lots of kids there when I was dining there, so be prepared for that.  Interesting (weird) beverage options, but enough to choose from that you're sure to find something satisfying.  I wasn't a huge fan of the dessert options because I find most Indian desserts too sweet, but there's also a good variety offered in that department.  We drove all the way to Brampton JUST to dine at Tandoori Flame, and it was well worth the trip.  Lots of parking available."}
{"text":"Meh type - too much hype to be honest. Probably better options if you go to the smaller mom and pop places near by."}
{"text":"This was my first time having Indian food. The place was nice and clean. The female waitress were nice and friendly. The place got busy very quickly and we had to wait a little while to get our drinks.  Lots to choose from in the buffet so I was glad to have a friend show me what everything was.  The Naan was so fresh and good and all the food I tried was tasty. I was surprised because I never thought I would ever enjoy Indian food so I am glad I did. The only thing I would suggest is that if it is your first time go with someone that knows this food so enjoy it even more and have a better experience. I will go back for sure and try a few other dishes I didn't get the chance too."}
{"text":"excellent Indian buffet. Naan perfectly done. The whole restaurant very clean, especially for all you can eat establishemnt"}
{"text":"Omg!!! I haven't had something this good in a loooong time. If there were 10 stars I would give them that. So so fresh and delicious. We have been sitting here for 2 hours now and I am sorry we can't eat here every day. Very very recommended."}
{"text":"5 stars for variety, even a mediocre fan of Indian food would appreciate the selection. From authentic Indian food to pizza  , onion rings and fries . Indian friend said it was legit so enuf said.  3.5 stars for food quality. It's a buffet under $30 stop complaining  2.5 stars for service. Was going to order more drinks, head waitress said to wait (holding a finger up) while multiple checks were being paid. After asked for check is when she told the waiter to take our orders... yet she didn't take it herself (10 mins láter)  3 stars for price $15 duller lunch buffet is above avg. but wasn't fully unreasonable.    4.5 stars for decor. Felt nice in this establishment being a buffet.  3.7 stars average so according to math 4 s  If you haven't been before to this venue and are hungry by all means feast otherwise Popeyes is across the street"}
{"text":"All the different vaierty you can think of. For similar meat dishes, they have a general and a halal version. Lots of vegetarian options too. This place is pretty busy. No reservation will be taken for under 10 people"}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised at quantity and quality of food.  I tried about 10 different things and liked them all.  Would benefit having more details listed with the name of the dish as I didn't know what some of them were, or what was in it, or how hot it was.  There was pizza and fries for the not-so-fun guests and ice cream too.  Service was slow getting a table and our table was not cleared frequently with our dishes between rounds.  Water tastes like chlorine or chemicals. Naan was amazing!  Lots of meat and veggie options!  Will return."}
{"text":"This place is so amazing!!! The buffet was delicious and there was a huge variety of different types of food. The best part was the decor, it made me feel like I was back in India."}
{"text":"came here for my aunt and uncles 25th wedding anniversary dinner with my whole family.  My cousin (their daughter) and made reservations for our us - as it was a surprise to my aunt and uncle.  when we arrived (on time, surprisingly) they had told us a private section (promised) was not ready and that they could put is in a common area for the time being. This was upsetting because we were all widely separated.   after complaining several times, they finally moved us to a more private (not completely) area near the back of the restaurant and gave us 4 tables to accommodate the size.  my cousins and i all sat together and as we ordered the first round of beers (two pitchers) they came flat.. so we sent it back.. low and behold the next pitcher comes and again, FLAT.. so we send it back and this time the owner/manager comes to talk to us, questioning if we know how to drink beer and what flat beer means? Offending my brother, he goes why don't you get me a regular pint of something else and lets compare that to this draft.. he comes back with another beer in a pint glass.. only for that to be flat as well.  it took our dad and elder cousin to step in and state that we knew what we wer talking about and to avoid severing us a pitch but bottles instead.   To my surprise, when we got the bill, both pitchers and the additional pint that was not consumed were charged to us!   a place of horrible customer service - do not expect my family to return here again!"}
{"text":"3.5 - 3.75 stars  You know you are not mistaken when 97% of the patrons are Indian and the place looks like it is at 85% capacity.  Although the restaurant boasts to be the largest Indian buffet in North America, I was a little disappointed.  I guess I was expecting a reeaally huge Las Vegas style buffet.    There is a wide variety of dishes but not a huuuuuge variety.  Stand out dishes include the Aloo Gobi, Chicken Biryani, Rava Kesari (I had  4ish bowls of this stuff - I was eating it like rice - sooooo yummy!), and some veggie curry dish of which I can't remember the name.    There was also an interesting dish (with its own separate station) that I unfortuantely did not try out properly because I didn't know how it was supposed to be eaten.   The station was filled with plates of hollow fried crispy dough balls with accompanying sauces.  There was also a potato, chickpea, and cilantro mixture located at this station.  It was only after eating my 4ish bowls of dessert Rava Kesari that I learned you are supposed to punch a hole in the hollow crispy dough ball, add the potato chickpea mixture and then drizzle sauce on it.  Although I did try each of the components of this station (crispy dough ball, chick pea mixture, and sauce) - I didn't know to put it together correctly.  So, if you do dine here, and you didn't know before, now you'll know.     That naan bread is okay - not particuarly tasty.  The samosas are not bad.    Service is friendly.  The dining area is quite nice.  The foyer is quite pretty.  Prices are reasonable - $20ish for an adult - does not include drinks.  Actually, since the typical indian dish costs about $12 - $15, the price of the buffet is quite a steal!!!  Kids dine for free on Wednesdays.  I enjoyed my experience and meal but I am not sure I would want to drive the 40ish minutes it took to dine there again ... unless I was in the area."}
{"text":"The last time I went, I paid $35 for lunch!!!! It was all you can eat, but that is way too expensive for an all you can eat lunch compared to other Indian places. The food is good but to be honest nothing spectacular."}
{"text":"This has to be the world's worst managed restaurant on earth. The hostess will not care to listen to your needs and then the server would take forever to give you a glass of water.  The roti chef is arrogant and haughty and will talk to you as if he is doing you some favors if you asked for a roti. I think the people who work here just hate their jobs because for them customers are like numbers on the tables and their job is to serve as many as possible without caring about the quality.  The food is equally bad. Most of the dishes lack flavor and all the curry dishes have the same curry. The desert corner is a big joke as it is all about quantity.  I am never going here again."}
{"text":"HAIR IN MY FOOD!!   This place looked good at surface, humongous food selection and all but I had hair in my food. I am not going to write anything else because that is just gross! Not sure I am going to return to this place again. I like my food free of Human body excretions."}
{"text":"Good Indian all you can eat. So many options and very good price. I've been here several times now and i love it."}
{"text":"The food is good, they tend to keep the spicing higher than most Indian places I've been to, which is how I want it.  I don't want Americanized bland food.  Service is where this restaurant loses points.  The waiters are just not attentive enough for drink refills or even something as simple as bringing the bill."}
{"text":"DH and I love this place!! They have a ton of food and drink choices. The tandoori dishes are delicious and authentic. The service is very good. We both love the goat leg soup they serve. It is fantastic and a must try. Avoid peak times if you are with a large group. Its usually just the two of us so we get seated very quickly. On special festivals they have live music and bhangra dancers. The food and ambience are both very good. This so far has been our favorite Indian buffet place."}
{"text":"Excellent decor and  variety  but  food is tasteless! Decor, price and  ambiance is  great , however the  Indian  food is  know  for its  flavors  which are  completely missing . what a waste  of  such a great  location and  concept .  They desperately need a change of head  chef !"}
{"text":"Finally decided to visit this well known Indian buffet and I wasn't disappointed! Considering most Indian buffets have a ton of curries but all taste the same and the only difference is the colour. Tandoori Flame by far squashed that thought and proved itself with a huge selection of quality food, veg dishes were full of flavour and meat dishes were fresh and tender. I also loved that they had many types of naan bread. The biryani was a bit hard but that's probably because I couldn't wait for a refill. I wasn't a fan of their Chinese food since I've obviously had better elsewhere & they could probably focus on Hakka food since it'd be easier to get the spices right, but A+ for effort! They offer both Indian desserts as well as regular pastries. They even have a few halal dishes. The dining area was nice and the staff was friendly. I'll probably visit again! All u can eat for two ppl plus pop came to $70!"}
{"text":"Not so cooked chicken,  chicken malai was raw . Food quality was mediocre .  When I ordered for my coffee after buffet coffee machine server told me it's broken and when I asked for tea she said its 1040 it should be ordered before 1030 seriously ! ( even when u say ur coffee machine is broken ) as far my knowledge goes their Buffett is open till 1030 how do u expect anybody to take Buffett and finish coffee at same time . Not recommended at all ."}

{"text":"Nice and clean. Ambience is great with Hindi songs playing in the background.   Variety is great.   In Indian snacks you can have Gol Gappe, Aaloo chaat, Chhole Bhhature, Cutlets... In salads, you can have Croutons, Pasta with different types of sauces. You can also have a slice of Pizza if u are in that mood, though the taste is just average. Finally, you can have Chicken 65, Fish Pakora, Malai Tikka, Achaari Chicken and a lot more In Main Course, you can have Paneer and Chicken dishes both, then there is Dal Makhni as well.  Main course was average but rest of the things were great!"}
{"text":"Okay so went back again to give this place another shot...this time I took my parents as a treat.   We were quickly given a table and then offered drinks after a short wait.   We had our first plates at the buffet mostly appetizers, like last time the food was mediocre.  When we went back for second plates we got Naan, goat curry, Channa etc.   As we were eating my mother had to stop and place something in her napkin!! In her meal was a plum pit (looked like a sugar plum pit).  Why a plum pit would be in her Channa or goat curry ...no idea.   I asked the waitress if plums were in this dish she took my mom's plate which my mother put back on the plate to show her.  The waitress took my mom's plate to show the chef abs brought itv back s few minutes later. Saying it was a tamarind seed.   A ) how unsanitary to take the plate and go god knows where before returning it and expecting her to eat it.   Most places would have had the chef chine to the table. .. B) Tamarin seeds are usually reddish-brown  and not shaped like a plum pit.  C) \"Well its no big deal,  the chef told me to tell you is not a bug is a tamarind seed\" was her response  We asked for the bill  And ended up paying $75+ for a plate of appetizers  a nobody wanted to finish their 2nd plate after the whole debacle.    The lady at the neigbouring table heard and said  how gross it was wondering if someone's half eaten plum had ended up in the or what if a child had choked on it.    Uggh so grossed out, I did reach out to the management just to let them know but they never got in touch with me.   Won't be returning here again especially after hearing a few other horror stories from others after ranting about this in Facebook.  :/"}
{"text":"Finally the forbidden fruit has been taste - and it taste fan-friggen-tastic!!! So good that I ate enough to make myself physically ill from being too full all night long.   We arrived last night late for dinner, approximately 9:05pm (I know, I know, Indian that late, I must have been crazy), but after 2.5 years of missing my chance, I didn't care when I came here.   Hostess was polite and letting us know things shut down straight away at 10 (that's fine) but seated us all the same. Even for this time at night the food trays were still hot and filled with food. They continued to even restock the Naan bread consistently throughout the last hour despite the two of us being some of the only patrons actively getting grub.  I really enjoyed the tandoori chicken, butter chicken and the goat curry - like a lot! But what surprised me most was the vegetarian curry options (paneer dishes). They were equally flavourful and I could have easily eaten entirely vegetarian and been totally content -- that's a first folks TRUST ME.   After two rounds I was stuffed beyond measure, even now as I write this 14 hours later, I'm still feel full. BUT it was all so damn good!  Despite my fullness my friend encouraged me to at least try a few of the dessert options (rule of thumb, stay away from all western looking desserts - locals know these are not made fresh, so just stick with the Indian desserts, they're yummy! I really enjoyed the vermicelli-pudding (think rice pudding with noodles) and the translucent sugared pumpkin - NOM! Event he shaved carrot dessert had me like \"whoa\".  You bested me this time Tandoori Flame, but I'll be back damn soon and hungry, so beware.  Eatcrest Out!  PS - reason for 1 star reduction was due to inattentive service, I assume it was due to late hour so I can't totally fault them, will assess and report back on next visit."}
{"text":"I never had the buffet. But take out is quick..food is good..prices are good. Lots of parking as well."}
{"text":"The customer service at this place is terrible. We were there with a group of friends for a birthday and waiting upon the rest of our group to arrive and while waiting one of the waitresses was hassling us to get food as they were closing at 10pm. We arrived at 8pm but we didnt want to get started without the rest of our group. When our group arrived, the same waitress, I believe her name was Kiran was hassling our group and rushing us to go and get food, and we ended up getting food eventually. The food was decent, but the service here was really not. We had to keep asking for water and at the end, when it came time to pay they gave us one bill for the entire group when we specifically asked for seperate bills. The waitress spazzed out at as and started arguing with us saying that we told her we wanted one bill when we NEVER said that and then at the end was taking our payment with a horrible attitude. I would never recommend this place to anyone. Theres many other places you can go for better indian food and will be able to receive better service than this place. This place is an absolute disappointment."}
{"text":"Service is mediocre.  Plates are not cleared promptly, and the wait for the bill was endless.  The glasses of water were warm.  As for the food -  well, it's a buffet, so what can you expect?  Some dishes were okay, the butter chicken was decent and the biryani rice. The meat in the goat curry was unchewable, and another goat curry - well, where's the meat?  All I could find was bones.  The goat soup was a hideous mess of a quarter inch of oil floating on top.  UGH.  I got naan straight fresh from the oven, just buttered and it did not get finished after the first bite.  It was flat, and tough.  As I said some dishes are okay, nothing to rave over, not spectacular in any way, just okay.  For 22.99 I certainly would not return.   The salad bar was a big disappointment.  Very mediocre, no seafood at all and for that money I'm not interested in filling up on lettuce, hard boiled eggs and potatoe salad!  If you want quality rather than quantity, this is not the choice for you.  By the way, the lineups for food were bad, people rudely pushed into line, an entire family in fact just because one son was in the line already.  To put the icing on the cake, there was a \"spill\"  on the floor that instead of cleaning it up, they threw a large towel over it.  I didn't think about it until we got outside later and realized someone had been sick out there all over the walkway... and the \"spill\" on the floor?"}
{"text":"Crowded,expensive,mediocre buffet and hopeless bar. Service was sub standard in the bar, and okay in buffet area.  It was crowded with people and everyone was rushing,it felt like chaos and it was hot inside the restaurant.Just felt like you were in a fish market."}
{"text":"Nice spread but the \"taste\" was missing. This place reminded me of \"Golden Corral\" so much. Same difference ;-) The items look good and there are so many to choose from but no taste.   Its a good place for kids as they can have pizzas and ice creams but then why would you come to an Indian restaurant to have that :-)  Service and ambiance is very good for large groups. The vegetarian items were much better than the non-veg stuff.   Pricing is on the high side, kids below the age of 12 will be charged $9."}
{"text":"I remember coming here 2 years ago and loving it. However, I returned here last week for work lunch and I felt awful for recommending this place.  Food is average at best. Nothing made me want to get a second plate. While the variety is certainly satisfactory. The food was cold and I'm not even someone who likes my food piping hot so that was a let down.  I tried 2 of the drinks - the zeera one was really good but the faluda was a regrettable choice of drink (almost a dessert to be honest).  I was sat in the middle of an imp conversation with my business partner when the server came over to ask if everything was fine - I said yes but asked if she could bring me a dessert spoken to which she replied by pointing towards the food area and saying spoons are all there. I normally am not even a stickler for service but this annoyed me as I had to wait till we were done our discussion to go get the spoon myself and at that time my dessert wasn't as enjoyable.  I won't be returning because in Mississauga, there are plenty of other places - cheaper and more expensive where I could enjoy the same food. Was actually really disappointed."}
{"text":"It is said to be the largest Indian buffet in North America and I have to admit its the largest and nicest looking Indian buffet I've been to. The place is huge with different sections, spacious for a very large crowd, food is quite exceptional (vegetarian, non-vegetarian, North and south Indian), ton of varieties, tasty, also have alcohol options. I have never been to any other place in North America that had a bigger menu than this place. They have everything, from appetizers, main courses, sweets, desserts, street food."}
{"text":"Came to the Mississauga location to celebrate my dad's birthday.I wasn't sure what to expect based on the three star yelp rating as well as the mixed reviews from various people. First of all this has to be the nicest Indian buffet that I've seen so far.we were seated immediately and from the start the hostess and waitress are very nice. Assortment of food was phenomenal, and as a vegetarian there was plenty for me to eat. Vegetarian Indian section was kept apart on the other side of the non-vegetarian items which was nice and avoided confusion. The food was delicious, I especially loved the appetizers like veg spring rolls and onion rings (I know who would've thought that I was mention onion rings in a review of Indian buffet, but they were that good!). Desserts were also fun to try, I specifically loved my first try of coconut barfi. The decor was lovely, soft lighting and the entire place including food area was clean and constantly attended to by the wait staff. Some reviews mentioned poor service by the wait staff but during our visit our waitress was at our table a dozen times, clearing plates and checking on us. I especially loved the photo booth at the entrance! Overall, great place, we went on a weekday and it was busy but not too crazy. I highly recommend Tandoori Flame, make sure you bring your appetite!"}
{"text":"Great food! Huge buffet selection. ---------------------------------------------- This place is getting more and more expensive by the day. We have a holiday lunch for $30 a pop and the food was pretty much the same for everyday menu. Why!?  I really dont think this place is worth it. There is a plethora of great Indian places in the GTA where you can enjoy better food than TF and I am going there!"}
{"text":"This location at 401& Mavis has a nicer ambience and much nicer decor than the Brampton location. I've been to the old one many times before and was impressed by the whole set up/decor here.    This was a decent dinner, seats many people and would be great for big and small Groups.   Food: appetizers offer typical dishes like pani puri, bhel puri, chat papri, pakoras (meat/fish), Tikka and salads. For the main dishes you have your usual selection of vegetarian curries (7 dishes), Chicken and lamb curries as well. Bread can be anything from naan--- they even had bhatura (big fried puffed bread) when I was there. I didn't try the Dosa (didn't look the best But it's there).   It fell flat on dessert-- the selection was alrighty and had your Indian dishes but not much cakes etc like the other location. Premade waffles are blah and are cold. There was ice cream.  Even on a busy Saturday night plenty of waitstaff to clear dishes as you make your rounds   Buffets are always quantity over quAlity. This is okay food 6.5/10. Fab for big groups!"}
{"text":"I love this restaurant when I tell my friends lets go for Indian I get a strange look but once we get there and they have had the food opinions change and they are hooked."}
{"text":"They've got so many options at the buffet, if you want to try everything you have to take very small portions.  Everything tastes great too. They've even got a lot of non-Indian food, and a large desserts section."}
{"text":"The Brampton tandoori flame is fantastic. My favourite is the Fisk pakoras which are to die for. The have the widest variety of soups pastas and salads. The tandoori chicken is so good and the briyiani is fantastic. Although it does get busy during holidays and events it would be good to book reservations before hand. The party rooms are absolutely gorgeous and have wonderful decor. The service is fantastic with minute to minute check up on customers with anything I give those waiters a thumbs up. The downfall is that it is pretty costly. All in all, it is a great place for friends family dates people who live Indian food people who don't like Indian food there is always something for everyone to enjoy."}
{"text":"Pretty good food, definitely better than most Indian restaurants I've been to in the GTA. The butter chicken, lamb curry, fresh naan from the oven, tandoori chicken and gajar halwa were my favourites.   The restaurant is clean, bright and has a more modern ambiance than your run of the mill Indian restaurant which- let's face it, can be a bit ghettoish/hole in the wall.   Our server checked on us frequently and was prompt with drink orders.   The one place they could improve is topping up food that's running low. I wanted some mango ice cream and it was finished. The lamb curry barely had any meat in it as well as the butter chicken when I went back. Came back in ten minutes and still not topped up.  get that keeping up with volume can get challenging when things are really busy but there's still room for improvement.   Overall though, I'd definitely recommend hitting this up for a buffet if you're in the area.    Update: lowering from 5 stars to 3 stars. On a second visit I found the quality and selection of food to be not that great."}
{"text":"I love butter chicken but they manage to cut the pieces so that they have some weird tendons attached to every large chunk. It is white meat.....I think!! You chew it and there is just something wrong!!  After a couple of take out orders that were not satisfactory, I started to order the paneer version of this dish. Shahi paneer. That was better but now it never seems to be the day that it is available so i have stopped going there for take out food.   The naan is a bit thin compared to what I have enjoyed at other Indian restaurants and if you order it with butter or garlic it is so fricken yellow that it makes you wonder what the hell they put on it.  The milkshakes are pretty weird too. Maybe this is what is acceptable in India but these drinks really should be called something else."}
{"text":"Bollywood comes to Mississauga  There are many roads that lead to the cuisine of India, and they all meet at Tandoori Flame, the largest Indian buffet in North America.  Who knew? It's a gastronomic visit to India without a passport.  First, we meander along the counters marveling at the 150 different selections. There are Gol Gappas, Papri Chat, Bhel Puri, Samosas. We admire the Tandoori Kabobs and Tikkas, and take note of the many luscious vegetarian items. Every regional Indian cuisine is offered, providing tantalizing samples of Punjab, Delhi, and Rajasthan specialties. Even cocktails have been created to match well with the cuisine. Where to begin?   I start with an intriguing soup along with some crunchy vegetable pakoras, slightly apprehensive that I could be overwhelmed by spicy heat. They have been careful, and the seasoning in every dish is mild to medium. Want more heat? Just ask and they will comply.  Young owner, Shraey Gulati, has set out to be the best, and it appears he has succeeded. The success of Tandoori Flame-the largest Indian buffet in North America-showcasing the vast range of Indian cuisine in Brampton and in Mississauga, has enabled talk of a possible opening in Toronto.  The variety of curries is exciting. Butter chicken, Goat curry, Chicken Biryani, Daal, several types of Paneer, and my plate is almost full, except for a few samples of Naan.  What's this? The sound of a drum and music. And here are costumed dancers whirling and twirling. It is all simply great fun.  Then I am back at the buffet for what turns out to be my favourite. Lamb chops and chicken from the Tandoor oven have the complex flavour and tenderness that I always appreciate in fine Indian cuisine.  Sauces. Chutneys. Pickles. Breads. It's a monsoon of palate pleasing choices. And there are fresh fruit juices, traditional desserts and pastries. To taste it all will require at least three more visits. And I certainly plan to do that."}
{"text":"Ppl are being too hard on this place.  You have great ambiance for starters!!  You get seated right away, no wait (I went for dinner on a fri night).  They have a huge selection of foods. I understand more in more places are catering to a general population so they don't make everything too spicy for our white friends.  Chaat wAs great, the paani was great. Chicken apps were decent but u didn't care for the veg apps- samosa and tikki.  When you get to entrees, there's a huge selection. I like flavor and heat. My top picks: goat meat, fish korma, koftas and yellow curry.  Butter chicken was not your typical blend of flavor but still a tasty one for kids and white folks.  Salad bar and pizza.....ummm come on I didn't  come here for that but it adds variety so why not.   They have a mini Hakka area and dosa station. They were so so.   Dessert: it was pretty typical. I wanted chocolate cake but all these little girls devoured it all :(  But they do offer jalabis for those who like that.   I will def go back. Buffet for $20 bucks and it's cheaper during lunch.   They have an interesting selection of drinks, still need to try them.   It's fairly new so they are keeping themselves upto par.....hopefully they focus on flavor and not so much on quantity like other buffets"}
{"text":"Very good buffet style indian restaurant.  Fun for first timers to experience a variety of flavours."}
{"text":"I'm glad that there is only one Tandoori Flame...for now.  It is far enough away that even with many of the great reviews, people won't flock to it, and I am ok with that.  It gets enough people in the area coming to it already and I have never had to line up or wait to get a table so please, keep disregarding it.  But for the sake of journalistic integrity, I will give you my honest opinion.  This is one of the best indian buffets for multicultural Canadians.  It has a lot of dishes, both meat and veggie that offers the variety to intrigue anyones taste buds.  It mixes western and indian cuisine so you don't have to worry that you won't like a food and will be stuck eating vegetables only!  They have a set buffet comprised of the salad bar, and then the veggie indian section, the meat indian section, the naan and rice section, the fried western food (which included asia wontons), the asian noodles, etc.    But two sections to highlight:  1) They have one section that every time I have been there changes.  They offer a different main dish there and if not for my dad, who in his youth travelled around india, I wouldn't have known that the dishes there often are from a different part of india.  Basically, they introduce you to different dishes from india that aren't always common in indian restaurants (i.e. not butter chicken) but take it slowly, one dish at a time.  2) Their desserts are great.  While small its still the most expansive indian dessert selection at a buffet i've ever seen.  + They have ice cream, but try the indian sweets.  They have a multitude of servers, and I do think that they are pretty aware of you, your drink (how low it has been) and your naan (and whether you are desperately looking for them to refill your naan).  Only thing they don't provide enough of, imho, is napkins...i can't help but be messy with indian food :( I try to not be, honestly, but I just lose control when i dive into those dishes! :(  The setup...i like.  Its bright and clean and spacious.  Most indian restaurants I feel try to save money by dimming the lights and keeping things cluttered.  Indian food is also very oily and stains easily, so the fact that they have kept it clean is a great testament to their total customer presentation.  I would say that for an indian buffet its tough to swallow that the dinner is more than 12$.  But with the many staff, the large space with bright lighting, the variety of dishes and the great desserts it may be worth the drive to brampton..."}
{"text":"I came here on a Friday afternoon for their AYCE lunch buffet with my co-workers. First time at Tandoori Flame and first time at an Indian restaurant buffet.   The place was large and clean. A few different rooms and they could seat a fair amount of people. However, the food area wasn't that large. Service was consistent as they were quick to take the finished dishes and quick to fill our waters.   I'm not an expert on Indian cuisine but I do enjoy their usual dishes like Butter Chicken, the Vindaloo and the Tandoori Chicken. I was expecting an Indian version of the Mandarin but I was wrong. The food that I'm familiar with, had nice blend of seasoning and spices and it didn't feel like it was toned down for western palates. I didn't see many vegetarian dishes though.   Price was great as it was $16 for the lunch which was more than fair.    Recommended and will be back again."}
{"text":"In my ongoing quest to ditch the sad lack of culinary exposure of my youth, I thought it was about time I lost my Indian food V-card. Or rather, my Indian landlord helped me pull the trigger. I'm not sure exactly what the cure for a couple of fractured ribs on a glum Wednesday morning would be, but being randomly dragged to an Indian buffet was certainly a good shot!  The interior was definitely not what I was expecting. I read another review likening Tandoori to The Mandarin, and I think that's fair. Very clean, presentable, and plenty of tables to accomodate the masses. Good thing too. There were around 10 people there when we arrived around 11:45am, and probably about 80 an hour later. The hosts and servers, while not really needing to do much, are also very kind.  It was the wronnnnng time for me to hit a buffet. I had just consumed a large breakfast about an hour prior to coming here, so I was pretty bummed about that, but I vowed to get the best bang for my landlord's buck, so I tried to sample a little of everything.  I'll say this, certain Indian chicken styles are some of the best chicken I've ever had! Melt your face hot sauces to be sure, but so flavourful and fresh! As another review mentioned, the portions tend to go rather quickly, and they're constantly throwing fresh stuff into the trays, which is great.  There were a couple of misses for me, but I would just as soon blame my pallet, and not the restaurant, as I have nothing to compare it to. Most of the things I tried were a win though. I have to also say, I think I would've preferred the place to ditch items like pizza. It just seemed oddly out of place, and it kind of turned me off the experience slightly. Besides, nobody seemed to be going for it.  Anyway, for $15.00, I ate to the level of physical discomfort, and liked this place a lot. I'm a fan, and shall return!"}
{"text":"Largest Indian Buffet with good variety and quality. Ambiance was great too. I been to many places and many buffets but glad this has set a new bar for my own comparison. Loved it. Must go!"}
{"text":"It was my first time had Indian buffet, with all kinds of curries and goodies that you can have at the same time, and they tasted so good!  Although I've never had Indian buffet before, but I believe that you won't get things better from any other buffet restaurant. All curries were rich and creamy, chicken was tender, rice and noodles were well seasoned too.  Will definitely visit again if I get the chance."}
{"text":"I've got a funny story about how I ended up here. One random weekend afternoon this past summer my wife and I both had the thought of heading out of the city for a short one-day road trip. Just to get out into nature. We had read about this place and intended to come one day but it's quite far for us as we live downtown. On the way back from our random drive out of the city, I turned my head and saw this place in my view and yelled for my wife to pull over! It was a pleasant addition to our random adventure of the day.  The story gets a bit funnier though as when we went inside, two of our closest friends came running from their table to hug us. We had NO idea they were going here and vice versa, of course, our surprise arrival was unexpected. Thus, we had dinner company too!  So on to the important part of this review. The food here is GREAT, at least when it comes to buffet quality food. I would easily say that this is some of the best Indian buffet grilled meat available in the GTA and three of the four of us that evening are Indian! :P Me being the only non-Indian in the group where everyone else at the table also loves this place!  Anyhow, I would gladly recommend this place to anyone who liked North Indian cuisine, who enjoys buffet experiences, and who's willing to drive out this far for good food.  Tandoori Flame, keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"Went here for the first time after years of wanting to try it and I wasn't disappointed.   We came on a Friday night right at 5pm so it thankfully wasn't busy when we arrived but it was definitely packed by the time we left.   We were seated in a small room near the front and the table set up was odd which is actually my only complaint.   We were sat smack dab in the middle of the room so we constantly had people walking around our table, behind us, bumping our chairs... Thankfully when I asked the host if we could move there were no issues.   I debated if I should take off a star for that issue and even though the issue was fixed, I decided to keep it at only 4 stars because it just wasn't a smart set up and I am sure it's affected people's dinners before.   Anyways the decor was minimal, it was clean inside and the lights were bright.  The food was amazing. There wasn't a single thing that I tried that I didn't absolutely love. All the dishes were fresh, flavourful and delicious.   The ice cream also tasted amazing. I don't know what kind of ice cream it was - but the coconut ice cream was to die for!   My husband and I can't wait to go back again sometime this month - its that good that we have to go back again very soon!"}
{"text":"The service was okay; they picked up our plates but we often had to ask for water. I wouldn't complain as it seems like typical buffet service.  The food was mediocre; I don't think I'll ever say I really desire to go here again. The food wasn't bad but it just wasn't good or memorable. Most of the curries tasted the same, food was excessively salted and the desserts did not seem very fresh. Again, average buffet."}
{"text":"We went there group of 15 .. I liked the decorations also the staff were friendly They mention it's not allowed to take pictures of the buffet thou! Also it's looking all nice didn't understand why but I respect there rule..Any way the selection of Indian cuisine and it was good the desert bar not so much thou .. Over all I like it and may go again .."}
{"text":"ROACHES!!! We went to Tandoori Flame last night. They seem like they are under staffed. It's very difficult to get a waiters attention to clear plates or even ask for water. When you finally manage to flag one down, they seem as if they're doing you a favour. Terrible service!  All this would have been fine, but the lat straw was the ROACHES!!!! I saw 2 near the buffer and one on the counter near the cake. I vomited EVERYTHING out as soon as I got home. The Health department needs to close this place down for a roach infestation! Beware!!"}
{"text":"I've been to several Indian buffets in the past and this is by far one of the most comprehensive Indian buffets I have ever experienced. I thought I knew my Indian cuisine but navigating the food stations at Tandoori Flame was an adventure in itself as I attempted to scoop a little portion of everything just to try it all. This was also the first time I have ever seen pani puri at a buffet as I have always thought it was another experiential thing to try that kind of stood by itself. The naan was out of this world! I've always liked naan but it was never anything exceptional until I came here. The yellow one (not sure if its the garlic or butter naan but I suspect its the latter) was incredibly soft, chewy, and fluffy. Even their array of desserts included things that I have never seen or heard of before.   The service was a little slow as it was head to order a drink in the beginning or get my check in the end. You also walk out feeling very uncomfortably full, as expected from any very grand buffet."}
{"text":"Most of the many items that they serve are delicious. I especially enjoyed the butter chicken and paneer, and in the desserts, the gulab jamun was very yummy. They've got a variety of items on their menu for kids and for those who don't prefer Indian dishes. Other items include a number of pastas, pizza, salads, chaat, fruits, ice cream, and lots and lots of Indian food. Overall, the restaurant was clean, the service was quick, and the ambiance was casual and relaxed."}
{"text":"Terrible food, unhygienic, non courteous staff, and loud and crowded ambience.   We went there for dinner and found a stapler pin in the aloo gobhi. This happened to me, but Imagine this happening to a kid. When we complained, the manager came and apologized, and changed my plate. He said he would compensate us in the bill and all he did was make my $4 lemonade free (on a $100 receipt). If you don't care to compensate, don't offer. If you want to compensate, offer something that could make a difference.  The service was bad too, the drinks arrived very late. The food is spicy than most Indian restaurants around and spicy in a bad way. The place is so loud and noisy and everyone seems to be cramped in the restaurant. I would never go there again and would strongly recommend you not to visit this place."}
{"text":"Honestly loved the food here and the service was great! Not the best indian food I've had but pretty darn good! Definitely worth the price for all you can eat to be honest.  :)"}
{"text":"The great thing about Tandoori Flame, is the large variety of different dishes so you can try a bit of everything. As with all buffets, not all their menu items are great, but you sacrifice the quality for the amount of dishes.   The naan was good, but not the best I've tried. The goat curry and the butter chicken were delicious. I did enjoy some of the paneer dishes; my favourite of these was the palak paneer. I also liked the chicken biryani. The rice was nicely cooked and had a nice flavour to it. The pakora wasn't great; a bit on the dense side. I disliked the soup I tried, it lacked taste and was watered down. After eating all the different curries and stews they all began to taste the same. I think the restaurant should have sectioned plates so that the stews/dishes don't bleed into each other.  For dessert they have ice cream, pastries, cakes, fresh fruit, and pudding. The Indian desserts weren't my favourite. In general I found most of the Indian sweets way too sweet for me.   The place is big, with tons of seating. We came here on Saturday evening and the place was pretty busy. Service wasn't the best. We had one friendly server and the rest weren't friendly at all. It also took forever to get the bill.   I liked that we got to try so many dishes, but after reading such great reviews of the place I was a bit disappointed. I'm not sure I'd be back in a hurry. I still prefer going to non buffet Indian restaurants."}
{"text":"We went here yesterday and I would not recommend this place at all. There is a lot of variety but it is nothing special. The flavour of the food is missing and we had a big family and that's what most people had said. They also took a lot of money for no reason. Don't come here you will waste money and will have many regrets."}
{"text":"In the mood for Indian / Pakistani food so we thought we would try Tandoori Flame for a change.  At 8pm on a Saturday night, it was an absolute zoo.  We were told it would be 40 minutes before we were seated but in fact got seated in 10 min.  Ok - the not so great things...  Why is it that buffets bring out the worst behaviour in people?  They completely ignore lines cutting in when they see something they want and standing like deer in headlights blocking walkways stunned by the sheer volume and choices dazzling their eyes and tummies.  And the good things...  The food was tasty and a lot of variety to make even the pickiest eater happy.  A nice variety of vegetarian and meat dishes to satisfy carnivores and vegeterians alike.  Other than the tandoori chicken which was moist and delicious, I can't say all the meat dishes I tried were great.  Good yes but not great.  The vegetarian curries were all delicious and I think the best part of the buffet along with the desserts with a nice variety to please all palates.  Service was friendly even though they seemed run off their feet managing the full restaurant.  Definitely worth a trip back to try all the things I didn't get a chance to try this time."}
{"text":"First off, the service is bad.   Their tikkas, tandoori chicken,  appetizers (gol gappa/pani puriii, chaat papri, dahi bhallay, pakoras) , punjabi style fried fish, naans are good. Their curry items are so bland and not fully bhuna hua . All of rice items are so disgusting.    (They aren't fresh. Over dried and hard due to sitting on the burners for a long time). Desserts are so yucky and looks unhygenic. $30 plus tax on weekend per adult. You have to pay extra probably 3-5 bucks for a pop please don't quote me on that cuz I can't remember exactly how much it was. Extremely over-priced experience for just OK food that didn't wow me.  I mean , I have had amazing experience at Shaheen Tikka or Tandoori Times flavorwise; therefore, Tandoori Flames is a flop in my opinion.  You can probably spend same $30 bucks in a restaurants like Tandoori Time, Shaheen Tikka, Patna Kabab, Iqbal Kabab house etc. and have a nice plate of Biryani, seekh kabab,  fish or tikka, butter till naan and still can bring left over food home.   Tandoori Flame is over-hyped and over-rated by some and I think this place doesn't deserve more than 2 points."}
{"text":"If you're aiming for Tandoori Flame, go to the Brampton location.   The Mississauga site has a long way to go. After screening through the criticisms already posted, I can vouch for almost all of them, based on my experience tonight.   After hearing about this site, two friends, my wife and I decided to have dinner (at 5:30pm). We were seated promptly. I ordered a Pepsi. Even while our section wasn't completely full yet, the server had difficulty keeping up. Water wasn't brought to our table until long after we requested it. Clearing of plates was very slow. I was surprised to learn that they do not refill fountain soft drinks, even though they charge $1.99. This is appalling as every other restaurant of a similar caliber give free refills.     The variety at the buffet was decent, though it is better at the Brampton location. The staff struggled to keep the area clean, though it was quite busy. I find it odd that the dessert area is adjacent to the washrooms - the last thing you want while picking the last items to top off your meal is a whiff coming from the bathrooms! I also find it odd that food plates are placed in a cubby hole BELOW the buffet counters (i.e near the floor).    I had a Groupon deal, and wanted to order takeout after our meal. The lineup was long, which is expected on a Saturday evening. What was not expected was how long it took for the line to progress. Although there were three people behind the counter, they seemed utterly confused - they couldn't figure out who's order was who's. While in line, I thought it would have been faster to call in my order. I called, but the line kept ringing. I eventually saw their phone blinking behind the woman at the cash. The woman was unoccupied at the time and oblivious. Despite my troubles, I felt sorry for the guy in front of me. He arrives at the front of the line, but the woman at the cash does not yet address him. He eventually gets her attention and asks what the status of his order is. As he is asking, she cuts him off and says that, \"they are in the process of packaging your order in the back.\" The guy retorts, \"How do you know that when I haven't given anyone my name yet?\" (wut?) The woman was speechless. This was when my friends and wife were ready to leave, so I left as well.   I've been to the Brampton site several times, and it has always been a good experience. Food quality, cleanliness, service, and layout is better there. The Mississauga site is unfortunately not up to standard at this time."}
{"text":"Great buffet at this price for chicken lovers which I am. I have been to this place 3 times in last 4 months :). I have been to many great buffet places in India, unfortunately any buffet place in Ontario can't complete with them, so I have to reset my indian food review standards accordingly. Only one or two dishes of sea food and very few dishes for kids. I enjoyed a lot but my nephew just had to pass the time with kids multicolour mocktail."}
{"text":"I was here last Tuesday (Sept 1st, 2015). I was recommended by this place by a friend however, he told me to go to the Brampton location. I decided to just go to the Mississauga one since it's a lot closer to where I live. BIG MISTAKE!  I was super excited and started 'snapchatting' the food, a man named RAHUL (the host) came up to us and told us not to take pictures of the food. My friend then explained it was just for snapchat and it deletes the next day. He looked at us and said \"umm....I don't care..\"  Okay rude. People take pictures of their food all the time and put it on instagram, facebook, snapchat etc. I've never heard of a restaurant that didn't allow pictures of their food. Strange!  Anyways, the food was pretty bland and wasn't hot. Everything that was \"supposed\" to be fresh, was room temperature warm. Gross..  I should've read the reviews before going to this location. Do not go here...staff is rude, food is bland/stale and it's pricey!"}
{"text":"I have eaten at a number of Indian restaurants, but I really enjoyed my experience at Tandoori Flame. I usually frequent places like India's Taste for the price and taste, but this place stood out to me. You do pay a lot more than you would at India's taste here, but you receive much more options in comparison. I love that there are Halal and Kid friendly options available.    My only issue was that I wish there was more information on what was in the desserts for allergy purposes."}
{"text":"Stomach pains for 2 days after eating here. Do not recommend. Food was not that special, dal was watery and not tasty."}
{"text":"Everything was too spicy!! And I'm Indian so I'm used to spicy food. But this was too much. The pizza bar... Nothing there.  Then finally when there was one chicken pizza (the only option) it was so overloaded with hot peppers on it that you couldn't even see the chicken.  Everything on the tava should have been called mirch(spicy pepper) with a side of appetizers. Out mouthes were on fire as soon as I started.  I tried to eat some fruit some onion rings and even something sweet. But nothing helped. Maybe that's the trick to get people to buy fruity drinks.  Even the veg subzi and daal was tooo spicy, at that point I gave up and didn't have the mouth to try anything else. (Not that there was much to try) lips were on fire and tongue was throbbing in pain.   We came with a group of 10 and there were a few multicultural friends too everyone was in the same pain! I had some gulabjamun jamun for dessert and the restaurant was too cold for ice cream. So we gave up and left. My boyfriend and I were in so much discomfort. Thank goodness for the TimHortons next door some warm sweet tea helped us feel better on the way home.  What a horrible experience!!"}
{"text":"I highly recommend this place.This place is not as packed compared to brampton location.Food was great a lot of choices different variety and cx service was excellent.Definitely coming back with my friends and family."}
{"text":"Monkey G, a very good friend from high school brought me to Tandoori Flame for a guided, Indian dining experience.  My parents were never adventurous when it came to trying different ethnic foods, particularly cuisines that they were unfamiliar with - Indian food being one of them.  That coupled with my weak tolerance for spicy foods meant that I mostly shied away from Indian cuisine.  Tandoori Flame serves up Punjabi food, and would be classified as Northern Indian cuisine.  Its sauces are predominantly tomato-based in contrast with Southern Indian cuisine which has lentils as a primary ingredient.  The exterior of the restaurant reminds you more of a Mexican restaurant than it does an Indian one.  Upon entering, there is a fancy water wall, a wooded bench with colourful, embroidered cushions.  But when your eyes glance up at the ceiling, you see a misplaced fresco with images of angels and blue sky.  My only conclusion can be that this was adopted from the previous restaurant that operated out of this space before Tandoori Flame called it home.  You can wait for a table by the bar and when your table is ready the hostess will come and get you.  Drinks are pretty reasonably priced as we ordered up 2 rye and gingers for $14 including tip.  They make it with the good stuff too (Crown Royale).  I don't know the slightest thing about authenticity when it comes to Indian cuisine - but walking into the dining hall where most of the clientele were Indian is usually a pretty good sign.  I felt like I was in primary school going on an excursion as everything was foreign to me.  Just trying to keep up with all the names of the foods was hard - but I took notes as I went along on my handy iPhone.  Tandoori Flame is to Dragon Pearl when it comes to grandeur and décor - just sub Peking Duck with Tandoori Chicken.  The dessert selection is not as vast, but then again its probably a blessing for your stomach as you no doubt have only inches of room leftover for a final sugar fix after having consumed such a rich meal.  Do try the traditional Indian desserts such as Gulab Jamun and Halwa.  My take on it is - \"When in Rome...\" But if you really don't feel like being adventurous, you can venture over and grab yourself a slice of cake or ice cream.  There is a salad bar with all the usuals: coleslaw, Caesar salad, corn salad and a few pickled dishes. There is also a small pizza station which no doubt is there mostly for the kids.  There were 4 different types of Paneer, which is essentially cottage cheese.  It is probably one of the only cheese that I can eat without feeling overly guilty as it is relatively lower in fat and calories than most. Other protein-boosting offerings included: Goat curry, Chicken curry, Chicken Biryani, Tandoori Chicken and Butter Chicken.  I also tried Puri, which is essentially a puffed Indian flat bread served with a parsley and yogurt sauce as well as a date chutney and what Monkey G called \"spicy water.\"  You're just as much of a coconut as I am a banana.  Eating the flat bread was interesting, as you have to break one side of it so that you can \"fill\" the Puri with the sauce, as well as chickpeas, onions and cilantro.  Think of the way a Tostitos Scoops is.   The Butter Naan was nothing spectacular, and rather cold.    One of my favourite items were the Aloo Tikki Potato Cutlets - hash browns better watch out because these kicked their butts.  They were crispy on the outside, not too oily, pillowy-soft on the inside and bursting of potato flavour.  I was thinking to myself they would make a great Christmas appetizer as I noticed green and red specks in it.  They were right next to the Samosas and I almost missed them because they weren't replenished until later.  Unfortunately, I only took one, and when I went back for my nth round of food, there were no more :(  The Mixed Vegetable Pakoras were also delightful.  On the outside, it would appear as if it were wrapped in some sort of seaweed, but it is just a melange of vegetables that are then encased with thin pieces of spinach.  Compared to the fish pakoras, these were less soggy and more crunchy.  The Gulab Jamun  and Gajjar Halwa were a first for me.  I was too scarred from my encounter with Jalebi as a teenager to ever brave the world of Indian desserts.  But I'm glad I did.  The sponge-like balls just soaked up the golden brown syrup of the Gulab Jamun and the Gajjar Halwa, a dish made from carrots and milk reminded me very much of a Vietnamese Chè in terms of texture and vibrant colour.  The highlights for me were: aloo tikki potato cutletes, puri, mixed vegetable pakoras, butter chicken and aloo gobi."}
{"text":"A buffet is a great place to get a taste (an introduction) to a new cuisine, and that's what it is...The food was a bit on the salty side and the carbs fill you up quite fast. The variety was limited and after a round or two the selections seems repetitive. I enjoyed their briyani and meatier dishes. I find their pricing steep and services aren't always that responsive. Overall, it's a nice change of pace but not place I'd choice on an everyday basis."}
{"text":"No doubt about it when one boasts on being the largest Indian buffet in North America. However size doesn't always matter. I've eaten at the Mississauga location on a few occasions and I must say that on every occasion they've failed to deliver consistency when it comes to both food and service. The appetizers are the only thing I'd probably go back for cos they're really good. Don't waste your appetite on the salad cos that's mainly catered towards non Indian clients. Entrée Is where they lack consistency as it tastes different every time and I mean both good and below par. Same goes for dessert. As for the service I've experienced both excellent and sub standard so its hard to decide whether it's good or bad. I can understand when the place gets busy, overcrowded and full of demanding guests it can get challenging for servers and the kitchen staff. On the other hand I've eaten at other restaurants where under similar conditions the service has turned out to be better than expected. The place can get a bit pricey too especially on weekends."}
{"text":"So I was in the mood for a coffee after a short workday and wanted to go to Panera in Heartland, but then to my surprise, I saw the \"now open\" sign in front of Tandoori Flame.    This got me psyched!  Apparently today was the first day they are open to the public and will have an official grand opening in three weeks.    Tandoori Flame is like the Mandarin of Indian foods.  This isn't necessarily a bad thing. It's like Indian food for starters.  It even has some of the same things as Mandarin (onion rings, pizza, chili chicken etc.), but it has a huge selection of curries and meats.  Butter chicken, saag paneer, chili chicken, goat curry, chicken curry, etc.    If someone is in the mood for Indian food in your party and there are others who have never tried it, this place is a safe bet.  However, if you are very fond of Indian food and want something with a bit more taste and prepared with more care, then I'd recommend Avani which is just a block south of here on Mavis.    So the dish I love the most, how did it fare? The butter chicken was tender but a bit bland.  Not creamy enough.  My favourite entree though was the curry chicken and the thai style fried fish.  The curry chicken was really good, but it seemed it was more Chinese than Indian.  It was even bone-in and I'm not used to that from Indian restaurants, just Chinese restaurants.  The other dish that was fairly good was the chicken biryani.  All other entrees weren't bad, just not shockingly good, which is the case for most buffets.  The star of the show was definitely the desserts and fresh fruits.  Baklava, sugar balls, ice cream with chocolate pump and sprinkles.  Fruits were so fresh!  Would I go back? Yes.  Is this my favourite Indian food in the area? No, Avani surpasses this by a mile and a 1/2, but for what Tandoori Flame is, it gets 3.5/5."}
{"text":"The only place I make a point to go the moment I land in Toronto. Simply the best Indian food next to homemade!!"}
{"text":"I like tandoori flame. Great butter chicken! Naan is delicious! Everything tastes wonderful! Always busy on weekends even if u make reservations you have to wait! Carry patience :$ worth the wait tho"}
{"text":"It has to be one of the finest upscale Indian restaurants in Brampton. It offers quite a few of authentic Indian cuisines with an addition of western takes such as pastas, salads, pizzas. Not to forget pretty good variety of sweets and ice creams.  It's a buffet style restaurant, with a lot of choices. Surely worth a visit.  Good food, good seating, great atmosphere and pretty decent customer service. All in all money well spent"}
{"text":"Oh Tandoori flame... You deserve a 4 star but today's lunch was not ok! The food selection - buffet style, has a lot of variety. There are 2 long stations for salad and the hot buffet has 4 stations plus little appetizer places. There's a lot of choice.  This was my second time there and the first time was better. The food was fresh. Today I felt that it was left over from a party yesterday. Bt my staples were there, chicken tikka (there's a lot of tikka variety there), butter chicken, goat curry and my all time favourite aloo ghobi!!! Best invention ever. Naan was a little burnt today... But the fruit station and abundant desserts made up for it!  Will go again, hopefully on a better day!  Go masala!!"}
{"text":"I had a good time here...  they have few variety of chicken, goat, and beef dishes... all the Indian vegetarian dishes, snacks and fruits... pizza.. fries and ice cream. Sweets and also Bob alcoholic and alcoholic drinks. the place was clean and lively with staff coming by and serving.. removing dirty dishes even though it was super busy.. so it was a good experience for me and my friends."}
{"text":"Man vs. food - Terribly crowded, wait time was an hour when I visited. My 7 yr old daughter was so hungry after a while that we had to take her to the adjacent McDonalds, which probably serves better food anyway. We were told that our table was given to someone else, and that we were back in queue for another 30 mins. We left. Worst part was the ambience with people pushing each other to get to heaps of food. Sheer quantity over quality. Very poorly managed. I've had food here before.. it's ok if you have a lot of time to kill and are looking for a large variety. But normally stay away. Go to Eddies Wok and Roll for a lovely meal if you are in the mood for good Indian-Chinese."}
{"text":"The buffet is huge; however, many of the dishes are not Indian. E.g. The entire salad selection. That said, it's a good salad bar.  The Indian dishes were impressive. Naan was good with the daal, paneer, tandoori chicken, and butter chicken. I tried a bit of almost everything. Also tried a hot and spicy chick pea dish which was delicious.  Good selection of desserts but I find Indian desserts a bit too sweet for me. The rice pudding was room temperature so I wasn't impressed. Other than that, the servers were friendly and quick to clear the plates so I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"See here's the thing about buffets, cooking a ton of items if nice. Everyone loves variety, but quality of food always. Our family had my cousin's wedding reception here just last night. My girlfriend and I didn't enjoy the food at all, sampled quite a few items. First I must say that our plates were actually warmer than the food, wait what? Yeah picked up plates that were piping hot from the dishwasher, well at least I know they're sanitary.  Samosas tasted frozen and not made in house, disappointing. No one likes processed food. Didn't like their style of biriyani at all, had very unappetizing pieces of chicken that felt rubbery and dry.  Why are your curries cold??? I love paneer curry and I'd say the curry packages at grocery stores are tastier than Tandoori Flame's version, barely any paneer in the curry, four or five bites and couldn't even finish. My sweet girlfriend can cook better than this, which I'm relieved for!   Some positives: Tandoori chicken and chicken tikka were nice and tender. Items I thought were the best... the naan and strawberry ice cream. Sorry that's just wrong! I've been to the Brampton location for a family function last year and didn't enjoy that place either."}
{"text":"The current trend in the GTA for Indians is buffet's. For the most part the places I have been to have been pretty good.   The decorations are pretty interesting. They have hung what looked like Sari's as curtains, and used the different colors as contrasts. They have an interesting sort of cross pattern with wood across the windows and the layout of the buffet is good.  The service was ok. It was a buffet, but it shouldn't take like 20 mins to get someone to come by to take your drink order. After waiting for someone to take the order , it took forever for the drink to come. They did manage to clean up the plates. This is pretty important in a buffet, and they do it pretty well.  The food was pretty good. I didn't like the Malai Kofta, but everything else was pretty decent. The food was pretty standard faire for Indian food. I'm not sure if the buffet was worth 19.99 though."}
{"text":"Again & Again we find ourselves going to Indian restaurants with a buffet. Personally the whole system is faulty (where are we, in a wedding?) and buffet system doesn't work for any Indian restaurant. They can't even get the Tandoori chicken right, why bother with other Indian dishes and destroying the beautiful cuisine. Chicken has been over done in such ways I thought they marinated the chicken to death. Dishes sitting for a long time lose their taste and freshness therefore destroying any flavour if it had any in the first place. No real food lover such as myself would dine here again because it is an insult to a tradition that is food."}
{"text":"Unethical business practises. Went on a Wednesday and they had weekend pricing setup. Why?  Because it was Eid. So non-muslims also have to pay weekend prices even if they are not celebrating?  Secondaly,  it's not a statuary holiday or a world celebrated event like mothers day or valentine's day. These are Unethical practices using an excuse. I don't need to talk much about food since it's pretty mediocre. Not worth a visit even just on ethical grounds."}
{"text":"Generally mediocre Indian food albeit the incredible variety of options and ethnic flares. Honestly, everything starts to taste the same after a couple of bites especially the different curries. One side has the veg options and the other has non-veg but our friends who had the non-veg said they weren't anything incredible. They also make Jain curries!!! Major ups. We went on the 4th of July which wasn't a big holiday in canada, so the restaurant was fairly empty, but service was still kind of slow for the amount of patrons that were in house (~20 ppl total??). Check out their pani puri though and make sure to add some garam masala, which is next to the puris, since the water was a little too sweet for my taste.   For what it's worth though, I would definitely come back for the speciality drinks which were UNREAL. We each got a separate mockjito (pineapple, strawberry, raspberry, and watermelon) and they were fresh, brisk, cold, big, and garnished w mint. Each of them had a spicy tinge in them (chaat masala?! Brilliant) and I could totally see myself coming back to drink all of them again.   Cost was not worth the quality and I'm not sure how I feel about Indian food items as a buffet style cuisine since Indian food is best when it's freshly cooked a la carte. Regardless, tbh if this comes to the states (esp ny/nj area) it would be v successful."}
{"text":"Went for lunch buffet with family. Food is decent, at best.  Very large selection of dishes, but every section has its hits and misses.  Starters section has good tandoori items (tandoori chicken, achari chicken) but the tava fish is quite bad (very salty, lacking in flavor); pani puri is good, but the bhels are poorly organized Large selection of salads plus three soups; somewhat strange considering its an indian restaurant.  Equally large selection of non-veg and veg curries. butter chicken, lamb curry are good, as is chicken curry (pieces could be smaller); chicken butter masala is sloppy The kofta was not properly cooked, tasted doughy.  Naans are made fresh, but should be kept warmer; they are drying out.  Strong desert section: no real complaint here but the jalebi should be immersed in a more tasty sugar syrup.  Prices are pretty crazy, especially in comparison to most other lunch buffets in GTA. You are paying for the ambiance and décor, which are both extraordinary. Service is good."}
{"text":"This is a nice restaurant it has a large variety of Indian dishes.  I like the fact that it had a nice fancy feel and would go here on a dressy occasions.   There is a good selection of food and a very large variety of different types of cuisine. I truly enjoyed this place and I really enjoyed their variety of desserts as well. I felt that it was reasonably priced especially for something that gives you so much variety. I like the fact that they also have pizza and other random items in case you bring kids."}
{"text":"To be honest i love Indian food, but i have been to better Indian buffets, seeing it's located in Brampton! I prefer more authentic experience, this place is very commercial but cheap!"}
{"text":"Well, there is no doubt that it is one the best buffet in North America. The ambiance is five star and food is not like anything in North America. Why it's rated so low can't understand it.  It has curtious to the point staff.  Well trained aswell."}
{"text":"Tandoori Flame has a pretty great selection for an Indian buffet but everything tastes kind of... meh. From the salads to the curries to the Indian sweets, I can't say I particularly enjoyed anything though I don't exactly feel like my money was wasted. It was just ok.  The decor is beautiful and they create a nice atmosphere. The bathrooms are really nice! But yeah, that's not exactly the reason I go to most restaurants unfortunately..."}
{"text":"One of the better buffets I've had. It used to be Brar's but they have gone down in quality dramatically over the past year.   Their non veg selection is great it's fresh flavorful, quality food. Naan is soft. Gol gappe is one of the best in GTA, nice dessert selection. All in all good quality for money.   I go there every time I want to play safe."}
{"text":"Tandoori Flame is awesome. Of all the Indian buffets I have ever had in North America, this is probably the best. I think that's definitely true because most of the time you go to an Indian buffet, you get the same few items with a few variations. Here though there is a huge selection of items and the food is all regularly replenished. The staff are all very friendly and the interior decoration is very nice as well. Overall it was a great experience and I would definitely like to return!"}
{"text":"An unusual thing happened here.  I ate without having any head sweats. It's common for me to react to hot spices by expelling H2o + NaCl. Euphoria ensues and that's when I know I'm in my happy place. Namaste.  I do have to say it's a nice atmosphere and the Pani Puri seem to attract. Looks like prices went up since I upload photos($16.99 now +1.00 Adult Weekday) Nice meal with Friend in a not-too-loud buffet, service nice enough. Of course I can make my monies worth, so I don't mind going again.  Let me start off by saying the Dessert sucked both flavour and sanitation wise. I could not pick up anything at the Dessert table without getting myself all sticky. Everything at sweets station is covered in some kind of syrup as far as I know.  :S  The curries, tandooris, pakoras all very mild to me, there are a few standouts. Overall I didn't have one or two specific dishes that was addictive. None that I wanted to head back to and grab more every round I went."}
{"text":"Went in Thursday at 7pm. Got seated pretty fast. There were lots of people from all sorts of ethnic backgrounds which was good to see. Loved that there was so much variety in food. Glad that there was enough variety for those on a strict ketogenic diet. Was worried there'd be more carbs than anything. There was balance. Loved the lamb dishes and the juicy chicken tandoori. The looked dry at first but after I cut into it and bit the meat it was juicy. There was one fish dish I saw and it was amazing. It just melted in your mouth. Can't remember the name. The only cons was that it seemed that there was only one server and he was busy getting people's bills and other people's drinks. Had to wait around till he got to our area to order a drink. One other concern there was a chicken dish with lots of sauce. When I cut into the chicken it was raw on the inside. I didn't eat the chicken but I tasted the sauce and it was delicious.  Atmosphere is great to bring first timers to an Indian buffet. Wish there was more fish or seafood dishes. Not sure if that's a staple in Indian cuisine but then again India is a sub-continent so it would be hard pressed to represent all the different Indian cuisines in one sitting and location. Would go back for sure."}
{"text":"Large selection of indian food. The resturant is  very clean and the staff is friendly."}
{"text":"Of all the Indian buffets in the GTA, this is one of the best.  You can't beat the sheer selection of tandoori and curry dishes and they also taste amazing!  I've tried Indian food at many places throughout the Toronto area, but I keep coming back here for the best Indian buffet.  It speaks volumes to the authenticity of the food that many patrons are of Indian descent.  I realize many people think this is the Mandarin of Indian food but unlike Mandarin, the food does not cater to the virgin palates of the Caucasian public.  You'll be pleasantly surprised by the Indian flavors and spices!  If you've never tried Indian food before, this is the perfect place to get your feet wet."}
{"text":"What horrible food I was so disappointed that I didn't even bother to take a single pic!!!  So I went here late afternoon for a lunch buffet.Thankfully I had a buy one get one buffet coupon with 2 beverage purchase but still I paid $26 plus tip and it was me and my daughter who probably had a serving of rice and a piece of chicken.  So I really gave a deep thought before giving this place a one star and trust  me it was not easy fo me to rate them this low.  The place it self is huge, very clean except for their bathrooms which were stinky and the toilets have barely any room.  I came in around 3 and their lunch buffet was going to end at 3:30, we made our plates and being not such big eaters it was plenty of time for us.The service was really good, the lady kept coming back and forth to check on us and said we could sit past 3:30 and enjoy our meal which I thought was a very  sweet gesture of hers.  Coming down to the food it was absolutely tasteless all the curries, rice and their biryani has no flavor.Biryani rice that they use is not great quality either so mushy.Most of the appetizers were dry and hard.They really need to up their food game.Coming down to the dessert boy they had a huge selection from halwa, cakes, baklava, rasgollas and many more and nothing that I tried tasted good.I was so excited to eat the mini rasgollas but they were hard and meh.Finally my masala chai which is amazing at most restaurants was awful here no food taste whatsoever.  They have amply of parking in the lot.I don't know if I will be coming back but will def try their Brampton location."}
{"text":"We went there on a Saturday evening, and besides the crowd the quality was very good! We were impressed by the quantity of food, the options available and the quick service! They had a large variety of appetizers and desserts. It was like you were at a wedding reception in India! The Naan was good but really filling, I will blame the butter/oil. You won't find a place like this! And also go there with an empty stomach!"}
{"text":"This restaurant serves great Indian food! The building and the inside look like a 5 star restaurant. The only thing that wasn't that great was the service. But overall it's the best Indian restaurant I've been to! :)"}
{"text":"Had a groupon. Was told I had to pay extra because I didn't mention it on the phone  Eventually, the girl at the counter said she has to speak to her manager. Came back without explaining anything and just asked me to pay the difference in taxes for the groupon.   The portions were horrendous. A golf ball piece sized chicken for $10??? No thanks. Wouldn't have been worth it if I hadn't had a groupon."}
{"text":"Love you Tandoori Flame! The  This is the new location of the mandarin-esque AYCE Indian Restaurant in the heartland mall area of 'Sauga.  Pros:  1. It looks alot better than the other location, more modern and really cool exposed brick decor.   2. The food is more openly laid out, with a lot less of that salad decor garbage  3. The Service was fast and efficient, and food kept getting refilled quickly  4. All dat fresh naan yo, jst never ending. My brother (little) was just standing there staring at the gy making it (I use little loosely, hes 21)  5. The chaat station, mmm pani puris  6. The grill station , mmm tandoori all day   Cons:  1. They didnt have my favorite - the hariyali chicken (Green chicken)   Thats it basically!  Check it out, its yummy and worth it. Cheaper than most buffets too"}
{"text":"A bit pricier than the usual Indian buffet but relatively tasty.  They have a lot of dishes to try but a lot of same chicken on a different sauce.  The butter chicken and naans are good as well as their desserts.  The paneer was a bit off and their tandoori chicken was cold.  Food is better than the service.  I would still come back but wish they would improve service like cleaning the finished dishes, bringing water and not making people wait for their checks for longer than 20mins. It happen to us and several other tables that prompted the ladies sitting next to us to pay at the terminal."}
{"text":"I'll give Tandoori Flame one thing: it's the biggest, fanciest Indian buffet I've ever seen. It's huge. If you've ever been to a Todai, it's sorta like that, but with Indian food (alas, no crab legs, either).  Unfortunately, the food is fair to middling. The curries were bland, the paneer slices were rather anemic, my soda was flat, and the aloo gobi was cold. Eek. The service wasn't all that great, either -- for a place that seems to be swimming in servers, it's hard to flag one down for an extra drink or the bill.   Also totally weird: they have a big glass bong as a decoration. It's next to a hookah pipe, so maybe it's on purpose... but why would a place so fancy have a bong on display? Maybe it's a subtle hint: the food might taste better if you'd had a toke or two before you got there."}
{"text":"I give one star because I have to, but it also smelled very nice inside. I was unable to eat here because there seemed to be an issue cleaning off the table I was supposed to be sitting at. It took around 10 minutes and they still had not sat me. A table for 1. They had sat other parties of two and 3 ahead of me but they were struggling to clean the table for 1. Half of the restaurant was empty...."}
{"text":"This was once at the top of my list for indian cuisines, but my most recent visit was very much a disappointment. I called a week in advance to make a reservation for 15 people, only for them to give us 2 separate tables of 4 and 12 because the bigger tables beside us were supposedly booked. After complaining to 2 of the waiters, they moved us over to one of the bigger tables and coincidentally, nobody showed up for their \"reservations\" at the other big tables in the room. Food quality was also not as great as it used to be, some dishes were much spicier than expected while others were too bland. The desserts were also very dry and stale as well. I understand they have a diverse crowd to cater too, but the consistency in food quality just wasn't there. The only reason they get 2 stars from me was the friendly service we received throughout the night after the table incident. Disappointing night overall though."}
{"text":"We just left this terrible restaurant with my wife after she chewed on a piece of porcelain in the salad and it cut her tongue causing bleeding.  Guess what? Manager and kitchen staff only asked which salad it was, and no apologies were offered!  We decided to leave as she couldn't eat anymore and the manager was right there he didn't even say sorry!  I have a picture of the porcelain piece which will be posted on here soon."}
{"text":"I went with my family on Sunday for my bday dinner. We had 6 adults and one 3 year old child. We informed them that the child would not be eating because he had his dinner already. He sat there for the whole time playing on his iPad. The food was good, good flavors, the naan was always fresh. The service was slow, most of the staff talking rather than coming and taking drink orders. When the bill came, we saw that they charged for the child. We asked the server if this was in error and explained (again) the situation, she said she would ask the manager. She came back, handed us the machine and said we had to pay, nothing else to it. My husband said \"well could we do a small take out container for the kid, since he didn't eat and we still have to pay\"- the server looked at him and in a rude tone told him \" yeah, go into the buffet and just take one of the trays yourself then.\"  The food was good, but honestly, the service was shit. We used to frequent this place, but I doubt I want to return somewhere that cannot even communicate civilly."}
{"text":"Driving up to restaurant I thought it looked damned good. A new building with a crisp outside finish. I then looked for the door. It does not front on the street or on the parking lot, but is perpendicular to both. You have to make your way under an \"arbor\" or pergola, make a right turn and there it is. Someone invested a lot of money to build this restaurant and did not think that door placement through.  As I walked through the arbor, there were hanging flower pots on both sides. There were not enough of them to make a big impression. I noticed that they all had labels hanging from the pots. Was this to identify the types of flowers? No they had not bothered to take the price labels off. They did not go to town on price either as they all were under $ 10.00. I guess the road to hell is paved with good intentions. I could only think how cheap and stingy.  We were seated quickly and being newbies, we took a walk around the whole buffet. We noticed that they had an offering of 3 soups and a section dedicated to chat which is not altogether common. They also featured 3 kinds of nan: garlic, regular, and something else. The meats were on one side of the buffet steam table and the vegetable dishes on the other. The end of one of the table featured that ubiquitous Indian dish, Pizza! There was also, what appeared to be a large dessert offering.  I tasted the 2 Indian soups. They were underwhelmingly tasteless. I had heard that in Indian cuisine there were no soups per se. That the British in inimitable was insisted that one be produced and so was born Mulligatawny Consommé. Both Indian soups were consommé type soup. They would have been better off to omit the soups.  On the hot buffet, there was a biryani that intrigued me as it was bright deep red. I had the colour of tandoori chicken. I helped myself to this \"biryani\". I also took a taste of each of the naans, some papadum, and a lentil dhaal.  The rice dish was good, but it was more a tandoori flavoured rice than anything else. A few chunks of chicken were tandoori chicken. The naan was not very good with very little difference between the garlic naan and the regular naan. In short not very flavourful.  The papadum were produced in a soul-less factory not on the premises. If you are going to do that, please leave the packaging out of sight. I want to sometimes hang on to my illusions. The lentil dhaal had no distinct spicing but the consistency was good.  I went back to taste of the other offerings. I sampled the butter chicken, the curried lamb, chick pea dhaal, flavoured rice and an egg roll. I also had a few hard to describe fried, cold, \"fritters\" that tasted nothing like any kind of Indian food. I had another helping of the so-called biryani.  The butter chicken was tasteless and the amount of meat very skimpy. The chick pea dhaal was not even of the quality you find in the supermarket in those imported packs. The \"fritters\" were just globs of something fried, and left to cool completely. The biryani had been replenished and to my surprise this time the chunks of chicken had a \"blonde\" tinge, not the tandoori colour of my first serving. This is when the alarm bells went off. They are probably \"recycling\" various chicken \"chunks\" from previous meals. There is nothing wrong with that as long as the meat is not too old, but to it artfully, and tastefully.  Desserts, I had a few but then again too bad to mention (with a nod to Paul Anka).  I don't understand! They spent millions putting this place together. One of our local papers stated that the goal of this \"chain\" would be to become the Indian equivalent of Mandarin. It is such a waste of money and effort.  I am giving them 1 star because the decor cannot make up for the quality of the food They just have to visit India's Taste and sample what an Indian buffet can be like. As an aside they are fairly expensive for the type of food. If everything had taste good that would not have been a problem, but in this case it sinks this restaurant."}
{"text":"Service was horrible. Food was ok. I agree they are the mandarin of Indian food. Sometimes cheapest isn't the best."}
{"text":"So I purchased a Groupon for weeknight dinner for two, we drove out to this location because friends had suggested it's better than the Mississauga one. Get there and we are told that Friday in their world is apparently a weekend, I was pretty sure I had just finished work therefore making it a weekday. This will be a whole other issue I will complain to Groupon about but needless to say this was not in the fine print. We waited about 35 min to talk to the manager who immediately said he was fine with us paying the difference. Which why the heck wouldn't he be! Now moving on to the food. The Mocktail I had - a mango one, was really delicious the Berry one my boyfriend thought tasted like pure sugar but I thought tasted like pineapple juice aka pure sugar. For me the buffet was good as I had lots of different curries to eat that were non meat. I would say they were up to par with paneer curries I have had elsewhere. The poori station was good and the little Dosa's were as well. I have only been to buffets maybe 5 times in my life so I guess I didn't have huge expectations. If you're going to be mass producing everything than nothing is really going to be exceptional. Overall I would say having paid Groupon prices, yep it was good. If we had paid normal full price, I wouldn't be so generous with my words. We both agreed to it was a one time thing, no need or want to go back unless a friend is having a party there or something of that nature."}
{"text":"Soooo much food!  Great selection of both eastern and western cuisine. I think I'm about to give birth to a food baby!! Ugh! :)"}
{"text":"First time coming here and I decided to order take out. However, not knowing how their take out works they didn't help me at all even though I asked how it works. Usually when a costumer is asking multiple questions about the meals and stating it's their first time, doesn't that indicate good costumer service?"}
{"text":"Bland food at its best.  This is NOT authentic indian food folks. The tandoori chicken only looks red, it doesn't have any spices to it, i was wondering how can the chicken be so colourful yet so tasteless?  Everything else that i tried on their buffet menu was pretty tasteless too. A lot of curries were just same curries with different meat options.  The only thing which had some flavour was butter chicken, I have definitely had better butter chicken but this wasn't bad.  The service was okay, not bad not great. If i am in missisauga and want to have authentic south asian food, i will probably just go to cafe de khan."}
{"text":"This restaurant is really good to bring visitors too - so many options that every one will be satisfied.  However, the food is just okay. It seems that they have changed cooks in the last year quite a few times, because the dishes taste different every time I have been. So wouldn't be surprised if one time if super amazing and next time you go is just okay.  We usually come here when we are super hungry and the wait at Avani is too long - and also because sometimes we just can't make up our minds about what to eat. So having tons and tons of options helps.  Overall, it's a good lunch/dinner spot for all types of Indian if you are craving a little bit of everything."}
{"text":"I've been hearing a lot of rave reviews about this place, so it was time to check it out. First off the exterior doesn't really look like you're typical Indian restaurant decor, but their interior makes up for it.  With the statues, silk drapery designs, and contemporary bar, this place is quite quaint.  Aside from their bangra band side show every hour there is quite a selection of foods available. However beware, their food is very rich, and you can get full quite easily.  I'd recommend to lay off on the drinks, and water.  They have a great selection of chicken, paneer, and vegetarian curry dishes.  The service was quick, efficient and friendly..  To be quite honest I found that their prices a bit high in comparison to most Indian buffets I've been to.   The food was great, but the experience didn't blow me away!  Bang for buck, and quality, I still think India's Taste in Markham and Brampton still has the Flame in my heart....overall 3/5"}
{"text":"We were customers of the Brampton location before discovering a place that we've been regulars to since but thought we'd return to check it out. We were very impressed by the decor of the Mississauga location. But it all comes down to the food, which was notably less impressive.  The sauces lacked a richness and in fact seemed watery. The meats were overcooked and either hard and dry or falling apart and stringy (depending on how they were prepared). Service was less attentive than average but not singularly problematic.  Considering Tandoori Flame costs about 1.5 times what we pay at our new regular place, there's unfortunately no reason for us to change back."}
{"text":"Honestly, this was our go-to Indian place until we looked up the reviews for the (new at the time) Mississauga location and discovered some criticisms that we frankly couldn't disagree with. Nothing horrible, just that there were better options. So after a little looking we found something better (India's Taste) and that has since become our go-to place.  But Tandoori Flame isn't a bad place and perhaps presents better than our new favorite if entertaining or having a business lunch."}
{"text":"Service was good one of the better desi buffets in brampton however it took them about 20 minutes to seat us but it was worth the wait"}
{"text":"Average food but good variety . Xtremly spicy food , not authentic Indian taste ! Buffet is okay , prefer Brar ."}
{"text":"Disappointed in this place, as I've had much better Indian AYCE food elsewhere.  The flavours were just lacking on almost all the dishes I tried (except for the butter chicken that tasted amazing).    The dishes I was most disappointed in were the fish pakoras (they had the pakora flavour but b/c it was just a piece of fish, the texture and overall flavour were off) and the chicken biryani (the rice was soft, the spices were very tame and the chicken felt like it was repurposed from another dish).    I won't be back for sure and will stick some of the AYCE places in Toronto."}
{"text":"Went here on the weekend with some friends - surprisingly the lunch crowd was thin.  I've heard it is generally packed so we were pleasantly surprised we didn't have to wait or that we wouldn't have to shout at each other across the table (there was one loud kid..but I guess you can't escape them..they are always around...lurking..lol).  This is the Indian version of the Mandarin.  The selection is decent - they could do better with desserts/appetizers.  The mains are not bad.  I just felt that the taste was ok...which I find for buffets is pretty standard.  The spice level in my opinion was a bit toned down.  There is nothing that is really wrong with this place...but I wouldn't drive from Toronto to Brampton JUST to eat here.  The weekend lunch buffet price is $17.99 (cheaper on the weekdays) and kids eat free on Wed."}
{"text":"Went here for dinner last night, overall a great experience.  The food was excellent and there are plenty of options to choose from with no shortages.  The restaurant is very clean and much nicer inside than I had expected.  Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Funeral around the corner.. Followed by some very good Indian food! Lots of options, very clean and maintained."}
{"text":"Oh my baby jesus. I want to eat here all daii erryyyyydaiii.  I discovered that I really love Indian food about two years ago. Since then, i've been roaming the streets of GTA and Toronto, especially little India in search of amazing Indian food. I FOUND IT IN BRAMPTONSTAN!!!!!   1. Choice. What? My ADD was all like F this and left my body for the afternoon.  2. Everything was fresh. The fish pakoras were absolutely stunning in their perfectly battered, pakorey way. It was legit white fish, not the mixture like you get at Hakka places.   3. The paneers...omg. Palak? Check. Mattar. Check. Kadai. CHECK. It was a whole frigging station of paneers. I want to drown in paneer. PANEER BFFs4Lyfe  4. Puri was so cute and delicious. I'm so happy I went with Anand (I was supposed to go with Abbas. But he hates me. So I went here without him to drown my sorrows in a vat of curry duck), my Indian buddy, who knew how to eat everything. Because Indian food is mad complicated, yo. It's runny, and there are things that you're supposed to put in other things to make the first thing taste good... anyway. Make holes in the little fluffies. Put everything on the table in holes. Mix sauces. Pour into holes, put in mouth, chew. Orgasm.  5. Staff was plentiful and super nice.   6. Butter chicken was so juicy. So was tandoori chicken.   7. PUT. MINT. ON. ALL. THINGS.   8. Can I hear you say C-H-U-T-N-AAAAA-YYYYY?!?!?! Mint chutney was phenom. The one by the puri stand was much saltier and thicker than the other one. I think the other one was right across from the puri station.   9. Desert - meh. Don't need it. Don't want it. GIVE ME MOAR MEAT!!!!   Nothing that I ate was terribly spicy. Surprised... We came on Saturday at 1pm, no line up and we were seated right away. Eventually there was a long line up that formed in close proximity to Tandoori chicken and naan.  ***ONE TERRIBLE THING ABOUT THIS PLACE: Refills are not free. What? Why? Who are you people? You get a small glass of ginger ale and refills will cost you :( Me so sad....  Will come back again until I die from butter overdose."}
{"text":"Decent Indian buffet, plenty of selection. The flavor of the food can have a little more bite to it to add to the authenticity of the food being somewhat Indian. But overall not bad - think Mandarin like for Indian food."}
{"text":"This was my third time visiting Tandoori Flame and boy has it gone downhill. The first time around the time when it first opened, the food was pretty good, standard north indian cuisine. Jumping to this last time, it was really bad. First of all, the service was terrible. We needed our server twice during our lunch, and both times we had to walk up to her and ambush her for what we wanted. Second of all, the main course food was alright. A few steps up from frozen President's Choice Indian dinners. I wouldn't have complained if it wasn't for the dessert. I had the rice pudding, which was like eating crispy (but not so crispy) cereal. The rice was rock hard!! It was either uncooked, or just refrigerated for ages. The Rasgula and Jalebi was, I am certain, at least 2 weeks old - tasted like old oil.  It felt like they'd started to cut corners and just kept going because they still got business."}
{"text":"I have been to over a dozen indian restaurants ranging from mom and pop to high end classy. I can tell you that this place serves some of the worst food I have tasted. All the curries were watered down with no taste or flavor. Don't let the decoration or fancy décor fool you. The food is crap."}
{"text":"AHHH. This place is okay. I think the food was average. They should give free refills on pop. They also should have Sikh kabobs on the lunch buffet. I will go back but think its little over priced for what it is. The problem with indian buffets you can find one on every block in Brampton and most are under 10 bucks. This food is not exceptionally tasting better then the cheap ones, but has far more varieties of food. Good Luck with this one!"}
{"text":"Love this place!  Been here a couple times now.  The curries are amazing! Could use a bit more spice, but I think they don't add too much to cater to the North American market.   Largest Indian buffet for the best price!! Saturday night dinner buffet is 22.99$ Drinks are priced averagely.   Large cold and hot buffet bars.  I will be coming back Service isn't the best, but it's a BUFFET aka serve yourself ;) If you make eye contact with the server they will come over and give you a drink refill."}
{"text":"Back again. I have to say, I think the food has only gotten better. The baklava still bites, however. Still. Who goes to a Indian restaurant for baklava. The tandoori chicken is nicely spiced. Loads of stuff your typical whitey diner accustomed to naan and butter chicken won't recognize. Went Wednesday night to celebrate my second real job in show business and the fact this time I didn't almost lose a finger schlepping a 6' unicycle. Ten fingers. Still got 'em. You're free to count them next Elite Event. Really. I insist. The place was quite packed. Might be some pre-Christmas celebrations. Do Indian people celebrate Christmas? What do I know?   Only down side is you have to ask about three times to get your bill. On the way out we saw some other patrons complaining they were waiting a long time to get their bill. Actually, they looked like they had given up waiting and were just about to walk out (a thought that had occurred to me after 20 minutes of waiting) but at the last minute their conscience got to them and they decided maybe to give it one last try by asking the hostess.  So. Budget about 20-30 minutes to get your bill. Probably best to ask for it at the start of your meal and gently explain last time you were here you had to wait a long time so could you get the process rolling now? Remember, it's buffet so not like they can spit in your food."}
{"text":"Came here with three for the Sunday brunch. All the appetizers were stale and cold. Asked them so many times to give the fresh ones but went on deaf ears. The main course was sub par with rubbery chicken. Barf! They had omelette and prantha stations which were all empty and no one was making anything on those tawa plates.  Now the dessert, don't even go there. Cakes taste horrible and I doubt if they were fresh. Fruits looked like death. Waste of a visit"}
{"text":"I've been a huge fan of the Tandoori Flame in Brampton: huge selection, huge dining area and great staff.   Unfortunately, the Tandoori Flame in Mississauga is nothing like its sister-location in Brampton. I'll list the pros/cons below:   Pros: -the quality of the was good -the staff were friendly and courteous  Cons: -the selection was horrible: maybe 10-12 dishes ...considering this is Indian food, where we expected 20+ dishes (as in the Brampton location): HUGE letdown -although the staff were courteous, there was a SINGLE waiter to serve our entire dining area (50+ people seating capacity) -we asked for a refill of water, and it came at the end of our meal ...and then they had the audacity to bring a single glass rather than a pitcher!  Conclusion: I understand this is a new opening, so they might not have everything streamlined, but this was a pretty big letdown from a chain I've come to love. I'll probably go back one day, but hopefully they read these reviews and clean up their act.  TL;DR: decent quality, kind staff, bad selection, staff/customers ratio is too low  EDIT: edited for grammer"}
{"text":"Finally tried this \"buffet\" last night, if you can even call it that.  Selection was dismal; some bland salads, some chicken dishes that look like they'd been there all day and ONLY dark meat to be found. Not a single piece of white meat in the entire building. A couple different desserts all which were extremely bad or extremely bland. Unripe fruit and defrosted, mushy ice cream.   Zero Canadian food for picky eaters except for pizza. And not a single kebab to be found either although the website claims they are supposed to have them.   The buffet itself is also very unkept; lots of serving spoons that have been dropped inside the curries or stews, and lots of dishes that desperately needed refilling  And let's not forget my number one reason for leaving this one star review:  $1.99 glasses of fountain pop with NO REFILLS. Are you friggin kidding me?  This place is a horrible value for the money. This no refills policy is the ultimate slap in the face when paying $22.99 on a weekday for a pathetically small selection   Would choose the Mandarin over this place in a heartbeat, any time any day"}
{"text":"I am a regular here but this is the first time am writing a review. This place gets a higher rating for two key reasons - the options of food available (there are a about 100+ of them) and the ambience. Indian restaurants in Toronto are usually congested but this one is nicely spread out. The staff is nice and friendly and allow you to take your time to try out the different foods. I have usually seen folks enjoying the Pani Puri and the Chaat. They are very yummy. Folks do tell me that this isn't the original taste but hey it's been customized for Indian taste buds. I love this place as I am a sucker for options!"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch.  Best indian buffet I have ever seen or had ... anywhere.  Frequented by the Indian community living in the area.  Need I say more?  You will not go wrong."}
{"text":"Ver nice ambience. Clean place. Affordable and good food! Worth the money you pay for.."}
{"text":"This time I decided to do take-out - give them another chance. The prices for what you get are definitely NOT worth it. They fill the container half way full. Do not do take-out!!  Avoid this location."}
{"text":"Went there because of the indian food festival. Was quite disappointed with the food. Everything was very salty and had the same taste almost. Am a very big fan of indian food but tandoori flame will definitely not be my place to go again the shrimp in the green sauce tasted raw and uncooked- texture was very weird. Customer service was great though really nice people."}
{"text":"An amazing place with so many options. I loved the way they have done the interiors, makes you feel like you are sitting in one of the restaurants in Chandigadh. The lavis buffet made me go crazy. There were so may options and everything looked extremely tempting. They can work a little more on the taste side, I think the daal makhni and the chicken were a little bland but altogether I would say that its definitely a must visit for everyone who loves Indian good. Can't wait to ho there again"}
{"text":"Extremely disappointed!!!   Was excited to find an elegant Indian restaurant with lots of choices (so other family members had more choices).   The decor, bar area and overall layout is awesome.... but that's where it stops   The service was friendly, but very slow and disorganized.   The food was terrible. Absolutely everything we tried was either stale (like its been sitting for hours), burnt, and just plain poor quality. In addition, the \"so called large buffet\" was full of filler and cheap items.   Overall we didn't enjoy our night, and would never return. So many places with inferior decor, but much better food!!!!"}
{"text":"For an indian restaurant, this place has the best decor. Nice upscale atmosphere. Good service. Food is awesome. Went with a party of 25 and everyone loved everything. From the kababs and chicken tikka to the curries and desserts, food is tasty. Will definitely go again."}
{"text":"One of the best Indian Buffets I ever had. Good selection, fresh, loved their Naan, butter chicken, lamb curry, pani puri, and sweet selection"}
{"text":"Arrived alone looking for some decent indian food while visiting Toronto. Put my name on the list, a party of four walks in after me, puts their name on the list and are seated immediately. Another party of three arrives and is also seated before me.   Finally I ask and my table is \"being prepared\". Seated, wait for five or ten minutes and no one brings a drink or anything so I get up to check out the buffet. It's quite ridiculous, most of the food isn't even indian. Pizza, onion rings, fries, fruit. The selection of actual Indian dishes is large but all it pretty bad. The rice is improperly cooked and lumpy; the meat all has bones in it and is inedible. After trying a few things I give up and  about to leave when the server finally asks if I want a drink.   By this point I'm fed up and ready to go when I'm told I have to wait for my check at the table. 10 mins later and no check has arrived so I walk up to the front and demand to pay so I can end this terrible experience. Worst restaurant experience I can remember. Do not go, ever!"}
{"text":"It's an Indian Buffet. Oh My Lord, I came back so full. Try it."}
{"text":"Went to the Mavis location for a party...we were in the private room. The decor is nice but simple and the buffets have so many items. There was a chaat/dosa area, salad area, soup and bread area, main dishes area, tandoor area with kebabs, fries, onion rings, pizza, a dessert area and ice cream area. Everyone can find something to eat but nothing is great tasting. The washrooms were disgusting. There should be routine washroom cleanings. Not a fan and likely will not go back."}
{"text":"Buffet dining is often akin to culinary gambling. You are lured in by the chance of victory based on so much choice but more often than not you lose in terms of food quality and/or taste. Tandoori Flame is far from spectacular and the succinct comment from our Punjabi hosts said it all: Their standards have dropped.   Several dishes were just OK and a few downright disappointing. In the latter category their rendition of Jalebi, a classic Indian sweet, was somewhat sour. Definitely not a flavour profile one expects from this traditionally, intensely sweet dish.   Drinks are expensive and when our host wanted a non-alcholic version of their cocktail the server repeatedly said in a monotone parrot like tone that it will cost the same. Only after being told in two languages that \"we don't care about the cost, we'd just like it without alcohol\" did she relent.   One standout dish that my host highly recommended because of its rarity and unique flavour was their Pindi Channa. Though similar in colour to Dal Makhani it's cooked sans cream and therefore drier. It has a distinct hint of tartness and tastes nothing like its more famous lentil cousin. The other was their Tawa Chicken which was quite delicious and very fresh as I noticed it being replenished regularly during our visit.   You'll fare far better going a la carte at Kwality Sweets which is only 10 minutes away"}
{"text":"There's this ridiculous hype that surrounds Tandoori Flame and actually got me excited to try it. What a disappointment. I wish I was better prepared.   Staff - The place is very busy during dinner. I overheard the greeters telling everyone it was about a 5-10 minutes wait; 5 groups waiting. Yeah, it's more like a 20-30 minute wait. Lies.   Decor - Plus points for the decor. It's a lot classier than the usual tacky Indian restaurant decor.   Layout - I feel like they could've done so much more with the layout. What I didn't like is they have literally placed tables everywhere. It's very tight; not a lot of moving room. And on a busy day when you can't select where you sit, you might get the tiny 2 person table against a separator wall.   Buffet - their ads boast the \"biggest\" Indian buffet in the GTA. I am not sure... it looked like any other. Let's do a buffet breakdown:   Chaat Station - I've been to other Indian buffets where they make the chaat for you. Tandoori Flame is self-serve. So yeah, you can try mix it up but it'll never taste as good as chaat from the chef that knows how to make it. You want chaat? Skip Tandoori Flame, drive 5 intersections down to India Taste. It's a cheaper, better buffet and their chaat isn't self serve.  Salad Bar - The usual spread. Pasta salads were really bland and unimpressive.  Pizza Station - I didn't come here for pizza.  Indo-Chinese food - the chili chicken looked so disgusting, I didn't want to try it.  Entrees - I've never had worse butter chicken. It was an orange, spicy mess. I tried the fish korma and the chicken tikka masala. Unimpressive. And I don't think they had a tasty daal. Which sucks.   Kebab Station - I tried Tandoori chicken, which was actually good. I think pre-ownership change, Tandoori Flame had a much larger selection of Kebabs. They had a decent selection of 4-5 types at this location.   Dessert Station - Ice cream is your best choice. I had some other desserts on my plate that I didn't like the taste of.   Drinks - They have a full bar, cocktails et al, a feature often missing from many Indian restaurants. We tried a pink drink (can't remember the name). It didn't have a lot of taste to it.  Verdict? Tandoori Flame isn't worth the price I paid for it. I am hoping to never come back.   Note: I really miss the Tuckers Marketplace it replaced. Tuckers was so much better."}
{"text":"We've come to this place many times and the experience is always consistent. Food selection is not as great as other all you can eat places like Mandarin but it is clean inside and the servers are attentive to your needs.  There are a few dishes that are good but overall most offerings are nothing special enough that you must go here to have it. One good thing is that they are usually accommodating when other places are full or at capacity for certain holidays.  I would recommended trying it at least once."}
{"text":"usually when I dine Indian I tend to prefer sit down over buffet however this was on of the best Indian buffets I have been to so far there is a big selection of appetizers curries and desserts it is true certain things where dry and not that great but others were good stick to what you like and it should be an enjoyable buffet i recommend trying chicken curry which is made with dark meat as it should be (butter chicken is made with breast I believe) also for dessert they fry the jalebi (Indian funnel cake) right in front of you * make sure you wait for the fresh ones* it makes all the difference   Atmosphere was decent and better than most Indian restaurants I have been to service was mediocre but I guess you expect that from a buffet   All in all they are good at what they do (Indian buffet) it's certainly not the best Indian food I have eaten however is one of the best specifically to Indian buffets  and I would return if that's what I was in the mood for"}
{"text":"how many has this place been shut down by Peel Health....too many to count.  \"Meanwhile, Tandoori Flame in Brampton, which was closed on Wednesday, Feb. 28\"  They will never learn....stop going!!!"}
{"text":"This is quite a nice AYCE place for Indian cuisine... we have been there several times and always found the place with high occupancy, even in weekdays lunch!!   A good number of choices, starting from salad bar, Indian curry, sweet and desert, ice cream, chat station (Indian street food) and also a small section for Chinese and Italian items. Food quality is better than average and prompt to fill up consumed items.   The service is not that remarkable, and needs improvement."}
{"text":"If you're in the mood for not to spicy, good flavours type of foods, this is the place to go. I really recommend their butter chicken and naan, it's delicious I get that like 3 times. People look at Indian food as always spicy, or only curries but tandoori flame has rice, fish, pizza, dosa, soups, Briyani. If you have a family and want to go out for a cheap dinner, children are free on Wednesday but I can't remember the ages. They also have a salad bar for people like me whose watching their weight and calories.. Their desserts on another hand is sweet and powerful, I don't get desserts after one Time I got them and had a really bad headache from it being over sweet. Buffet style restaurants are always my favs gives you more options and it's worth your money."}
{"text":"Love the buffet here. They have the best lunch and dinner buffet around. Veg and non-veg selection is on point.   Really clean and organized, along with the staff helpful and quickly clean up the plates for you after finishing a plate."}
{"text":"Average food,but what really makes me give it only 2 stars is how dirty and messy this place was, Their staff is not ready to serve such as hight volume of customers. The floor was so greasy that you can't even walk, all the bars has spelling food and they never bother to clean them, the tables were left with dirty dishes for more then 10 minutes and the list keep going !"}
{"text":"The food was good but nothing was exceptionally good. That is a problem with most buffets. Due to the bulk of food, the quality usually suffers. Still one of the best buffets in town. We definitely need more better indian cuisine places in toronto. The desserts were the worst part of this place. Service is good even though it is always busy. There is definitely a wide variety but they should pay more attention the quality of the various main course dishes."}
{"text":"Good food. Great selection.  Great service.  I rate it 4 star because it was priced a bit more steep than I would have expected."}
{"text":"Food is not amazing everyday their people do not listen to you if you ask for something. The appearence is good no doubt but it is not fresh. I would prefer AVANI BISTRO  for good INDIAN FOOD rather than tandoori flame. Yes this place is good for family, has good parking space, good ambience but at the end we spend money for food as well which is 3rd time i am trying this place not good. This is a no no place for futre visits."}
{"text":"The king of Indian restaurants. My girlfriend and I enjoy their lunch buffet.  The first time I tried the food here was with my cousin from the US, and they were quite flattered.  The masala dosas taste wonderful with the chutneys. Most of the food are based on north Indian menu, even then, the non-veg section doesn't miss a beat. The dessert table is quite big too."}
{"text":"Food poisoning! Beware!  I had gone there with 3 other adults for dinner and we all got sick the next day.  I called the restaurant back and they refused to give me a refund and only offered free buffet for two even when I made it clear I wouldn't dream of eating there again.  I would definitely not go to the Dixie Rd. location again and food safety should really be looked at and reported."}

This place is a family oriented place, with a nice ambience, but where you can dress casual or dressy casual. I think you will enjoy it! :)"}
{"text":"Is this the best Indian food around.....likely not! Is it the most fun I have had earring Indian food....very likely! I was disparate for dinner with no clue were to eat until Yelp steered me to Indian Flame. The food was plentiful and well pr scented and the crowds of people seemed to be having a great time. And my neighbors engaged me in their family gathering and made me feel very welcome. I loved the varied desserts and left very satisfied with some great memories."}
{"text":"Hands down the best Indian food that I have had anywhere outside of India, the taste is authentic, great flavors and the spread of food for $25 is ridiculous. I was blown away with how big the buffet is and the numerous options that you have in each category - appetizers, entrees, desserts, breads, and chats.  The place was very busy and I am not sure if they are rightly staffed for the size of the place. I felt that they are short staffed because we had to ask for water a few times to the waitress who was not even attending to our table.  If i have to comment on the food, I LOVED it and will any day choose to come down here to have Indian food. Definite worth for the money you pay."}
{"text":"Atmosphere was modern, clean and had a large facility. Although, it did not provide an \"authentic\" Indian feel with decor, there were a lot of food options. Was a bit disappointed with the curries as most of them tasted very similar, however they did provide half vegetarian options for those who don't eat meat.   The best part was the warm dosai, and the coconut sambal. There were many appealing dessert options however they looked better than they tasted and had fans blowing on the food, which I thought was a bit odd.  Also ordered the mango lassi which was average, but they did offer a lot of different alcoholic and mocktail drinks in cute mason jars.  It was a great first try, but I don't think I will be returning here anytime soon for the sit-down buffet."}
{"text":"I've been waiting for Tandoori Flame to open since they first announced a few months back. On Saturday I finally got to try them out!  We got there for 12 so we were pretty much the first ones there. Decor is nice and so were the servers. There was plenty of foods to choose from and everything looked and smelled freshly cooked.  My faves were the tandoori chicken, butter chicken, and the mini samosa's. I don't really eat Indian foods but those are the things I usually get if I ever ate Indian food. If you haven't tried Indian food, don't worry. They have several American foods, such as pizza.  The other two that were with me thought the food was alright. They probably thought that because they've eaten Indian food the entire life.  Overall, Tandoori Flame is pretty good and I would return in the future."}
{"text":"Perhaps one of the worst Indian Buffett's I've ever had. Brampton location is far far better. The dishes are poorly seasoned with cheap ingredients. The chicken taste of poor quality and they have a poor selection of lamb/goat. Avoid it. Yes it's clean but the food is not worth it. Dessert menu has a lot to be desired. Will never go again."}
{"text":"When I entered the restaurant on a Saturday night, the entire place was packed and filled with quite a diverse group of people. It was a very lively atmosphere, with a very nice ambiance. The decor was quite nice, and not the 'typical' Indian buffet restaurant experience  I was skeptical about ordering a group/catering order from this restaurant as I haven't dined here before. I have to say that my experience with the individual on the phone wasn't the best as they had to put me on hold several times to either confirm whether an item was available or what the actual dish and its ingredients were, and there were some language issues as well (and I speak their language). However, the food was absolutely fantastic!  I was so impressed with first of all, the catering containers as usually we are given flimsy tinfoil takeout containers; the ones at Tandoori Flame were packaged in high quality foil containers, and then packaged again in cardboard boxes and labelled as to what was inside. The employees also loaded the individual items into my car for me as well.  The package that I chose for 15 people was the 13 item menu which is quite a lot of food; I chose the aloo tikkis and chicken tikka for appetizers, in addition to pappadum, green salad, penne pasta, fruit salad, pulao rice, naan, karahi chicken, butter chicken, channa masalla, malai paneer which also includes chutneys and cutlery.  My guests (who were mostly Indian) were so impressed at the quality and authenticity of the food.  I would definitely recommend this restaurant and I will be ordering from here again. My only reason for not giving it a 5/5 would be the telephone/ordering experience; perhaps they could have an online ordering system."}
{"text":"I've seen my share of Indian Buffet (IB) restaurants.  Enough so that my friends all know what \"going IB\" means.  Most of the time I'm with a bunch of ravenously hungry guys who value a 50/50 split between quality and quantity.  We're the ones who every buffet restaurant loathes to see because of sheer ecological devastation we can bring to those tasty flora and fauna.  There is absolutely no way they make any money off our visits, but I'm sure we're in the minority.  Having said that, the food is really quite decent.  It's not fine dining mind you, but it is decent enough to bring me back, and not just with my hungry-hungry pals.  My wife throughly enjoyed it too.  The selection is quite diverse even at lunch.  I found it difficult to portion control sufficiently to be able to try a large number of dishes.  (It's very difficult as there are many!)  If I'm in the area and hungering for IB, I will most certainly come back to this place...  Heck, even if I'm not in the area I'll make my way here seeing as I'm a glutton.  If my stomach isn't seriously distended at the end of the meal, I'll need to get another few plates."}
{"text":"Better location than the mississauga one. There is a lot more food variety. However some of the non asian cuisine just taste like out of the freezer quality. The dessert spread contains a lot of variety as well. Service is quick."}
{"text":"We came here on a Thursday evening in May, and it was definitely pretty empty. The food was average at best. Nothing made us want to get a second plate. The variety of the main items were also sub par, when we realized that many of the items were gravy based and pretty similar to one another. I will say the Jaipuri Gobi was really tasty though.   For drinks, we tried the Mango Lassies which were pretty tangy, but good.  You can easily tell there is little turnover of food on a Thursday night, because the food was not very hot and the chefs came out a couple of times, to move a few gravy items into smaller serving dishes, signalling that they won't be making any more of that item.   I normally love any meat item that is cooked in a Tandoor, but all three chickens that were served were pretty tough, which meant that a lot of the food was not fresh and had been sitting out   Overall we were pretty disappointed in the quality of the food and won't be returning  to this Mississauga location."}
{"text":"Great selection of items, food is tasty, and good for large groups.  It gets pretty busy on the weekends, so try making a reservation ahead of time."}
{"text":"Love these statues outside the restaurant both the exterior and interiors are awesome!!  What an elaborate buffer never ending choice of Indian food from all states of India  The food was too spicy very chilli hot cudnt deal with it Actually cudnt even taste the food as was too too hot    We were there on the weekend at 10.30 pm since the restaurant closes at 11 pm we couldn't have a buffet so had a la carte  We ordered goat vindaloo and paneer tikka Masala  The tikka masala was yellow gravy to my surprise  And goat vindaloo was way too spicy couldn't eat it  Naans were ok"}
{"text":"I hate buffets. Mainly because they require self control around food. That is a problem for me; especially if I am let loose in one that has delicious food. This is one such place. I have been here twice so far, for family gatherings, and both times I stuffed my face until I could hardly move. Every dish is tasty, there are a lot of different dishes, it is impossible to stop. Also, they make a yummy mango Lassi!"}
{"text":"Slow service and very understaffed. Plus food wasn't THAT great. Won't go again. Inside was very nicely designed. Have to give credit for that."}
{"text":"Wow! This place is amazing. Great choice of food from buffet. Friendly and very helpful staff. Had a wonderful meal although ate way more than I should have. Highly recommend you make a visit!!"}
{"text":"i love this place. best indian food in the GTA"}
{"text":"Overall an excellent buffet filled with more options than I could handle. The food was very good, especially considering it was a buffet. Lots of  vegetarian options too.  The service wasn't great. I made a reservation online and received three phone calls verifying that I was coming. Upon arrival the hostess made it seem like we had showed up out of nowhere and gave us a table that was too small for our group. During dinner our plates also piled up and it took a lot of effort to get someone to bring us drinks."}
{"text":"Brampton is the capital for Indian food in the GTA so it was obvious to us to look for an Indian restaurant when we were in the area.  Since we rarely go to Brampton, we decided to try the biggest one around in Tandoori Flame.  They bill themselves as the largest Indian buffet in North America and I have to admit its the largest and nicest looking Indian buffet I've been to.  The look is classical but modern Indian with wood panels and designs.  There is a lot of seating as the place can hold about 500 guests.  Ton of options with regards to curries, tandooris, meat and veggies.   Pani poori, naan, samosas and even dosas are found here.  There's also some halal and even a section for kids with pizza, nuggets and fries.  Like most buffets, some items were really good such as the butter and tandoori chicken but others not so much like some of paneer dishes.  The dessert section was actually a nice treat with various Indian desserts including the fresh made garam kadari kheer which is a fried syruped batter that is topped with a sweetened milk pudding.  Service was overall attentive and friendly so that is always a plus.   As a side note the washrooms were perhaps the nicest and cleanest ones I've ever seen in an Indian restaurant which is a HUGE plus! Haha!  Pricing here is on the high side for an Indian buffet at $26/pp and $11 for kids 3-11 and $3 for kids under 3 but its understandable for the variety and upscale decor.  You can actually have a nice gathering for large groups here.  Overall I still prefer India's Taste in Markham for food quality alone but with the huge selection and decor it definitely warrant a 4 out of 5 from me."}
{"text":"Good place for people interested in trying Indian food for the first time. Not as many items as they claim and usually they are slow at re stocking the food.  Little bit overpriced IMO aswell"}
{"text":"2 stars might seem like a very harsh review; if you like Mandarin Buffet type of food, then by all means this place is for you and you will probably enjoy it.   However if you care more about the taste and quality of the food, then d'effort this place is not for you.   The restaurant itself is very nice, clean and well decorated. The food choices at the buffet is varied and there is something for everyone and every taste bud. It's generally good for really large gatherings, food is cheap and quick.   On the few occasions that I've  been to this restaurant, I ate only from the grilled appetizers and fresh naan breads. They are being made right in front of you - so you are sure that it's fresh.  The sauces for most of the curries taste very similar to one-another and are not recommended. As far as deserts go, they are the same - stick to fresh fruit?    Service is usually very good, what you would get at Mandarin :D"}
{"text":"Great place with great tasty food. There are over 150 items that you can select from. Coverage over veg n non-veg is pretty good. I tried mostly their non-veg items which were pretty daam good. All the food tasted exactly how it should be tasting. No more or less masala. Perfect food on vacation."}
{"text":"This place is in a true sense lives up to the name \"The Grand Indian Buffet\". The spread is great and really tasty. We moved to Toronto from the States, 3 months back and we have been to this place 3 times now and have thoroughly enjoyed each time. Everything about this place starting from the staff, ambiance gets 5 stars. Taking away 1 star from the food because they need to add more variety to the appetizer spread (shrimp, fish, vegetarian options) I would definitely recommend others to go and try out this place."}
{"text":"very good place you will love it Excellent delicious food with alot of varieties Really clean and organized and reasonable price i accidentally found it and i go regular now  its a family friendly place must visit with your family"}
{"text":"Despite the mediocre rating I gave it I will probably return here as it's great value for money and has a good amount of variety, though not nearly as much as the Brampton location. Plus it's a nice place with great atmosphere (much nicer than the Brampton location in my opinion, but I guess it is a new restaurant after all).  However... 1) Many of the curries were lukewarm which is a big turn-off. I went for lunch around 1:30 on a weekday and it wasn't very busy so maybe that's why? 2) Many items seemed like they had been sitting out. There was barely any rice left, and since it wasn't busy, it had probably been sitting for a long while. 3) No shrimp to be found in the shrimp curry? 4) The naan is very thin and some parts are pretty crispy because of it. Personally I prefer naan soft and a bit thicker but that's just me. 5) A couple of the deep-fried options seemed like they hadn't been fried at a high enough temperature because they tasted very oily :S 6) The butter chicken was kind of tomato-soupy-tasting (and butter chicken is my favourite dish).  On a positive note, I really liked the rice pudding and the gulab jamun! Because they are new they gave coupons with the bill, one for $5 off takeout and one for $4 worth of mocktails, which I thought was a neat finish to our lunch."}
{"text":"May/12/2018 - 5PM sharp.  Weather: Cool, slight breeze, overcast.  The Good: Excellent buffet! There is something here for everyone - even newcomers to Indian cuisine. The quality of food is excellent and the variety is solid. The restaurant is clean, well kept and the staff are attentive. There is also an interesting and fun cocktail & drinks menu for both kids and adults.   The Bad: The music was appropriate but, a bit loud.   The Ugly: Nothing to say here."}
{"text":"The dinner buffet had a nice variety of dishes including favorites like naan, curried goat and butter chicken. I tried a little of all the curry options and each one was tasty. Great value for the money. Dinner buffet was less than $20 per adult."}
{"text":"What a turnaround of a place that I had enjoyed in the past!  Only item that was palatable this time was the Karhai paneer and Naan. Biryani tasted like washed in chlorine. Tandoori chicken lacked flavour and not even close. The goat soup sucked. It was liked they washed a Kadai and gave the washed water.  I can simply keep on writing and piling up my ordeal. This would be my last visit to this location.   Maybe I'll give another try at their Mississauga location. Dixie, you are out!"}
{"text":"Ha just thinking about this place makes me laugh. Larger than life. It's awesome - really is. You ask for a glass of wine - you're getting a half litre in one glass. You want variety, the world is your pakora."}
{"text":"Good selection, varied selection, decent quality. It's a buffet. If you live in brampton, great! If you're driving out there for TF, it's not all its meant to be."}
{"text":"Mediocre Indian food. Over priced for dinner. Everything starts to taste the same at each station, example all the chickens and kebabs and even tandoori chicken all tastes very similar.   My favourite was the gol gupa and chat papri station.   It's very easy to over eat even just trying a little of 50% of the items. If you're on a diet or health conscious - stay away.   I also like how they are constantly refilling all the food stations. And that they have a lot of fresh cut fruit and a few veggies and salad too.   I didn't try the soups or the dosas so I can't comment.   The kheer was good and so was the gulab jaman. They also have ice cream plus sprinkles for kids. As well as cheese pizza for kids.   Beverages are extra but I didn't order any.   The price ads up for dinner.  Ambience: - modern decor - different rooms which helps keep the noise tolerable  - they clear the empty plates from you table often  - take your drink order right away (non-alcoholic)   I would not recommend this restaurant to a friend or family member. Nor would I come back again for dinner but maybe for lunch as it's more reasonably priced ($15-16/each)."}
{"text":"I eat Indian just about every chance I get since I can't get it in my little town. Spent 2 weeks in India a couple years ago and never ate American there even when given the chance!  I've gotta say this may be the best Indian buffet I've been too. The place may a little off-putting at first as it is so big and there are so many families.  The variety of food is almost ridiculous (and certainly includes plenty of non-Indian food, if you're trying to convince a friend to go with you).  But among the many many dishes there, there are many, many Indian dishes.  I think I had to fill 3 different plates to try everything I wanted and I still skipped a few of the more ordinary dishes (like butter chicken).  I managed to have 3-4 dishes I'd never had before.  All were good.  Very flavorful.   I hope to visit again."}
{"text":"OK food.  not the greatest. but for those who dont know how to order indian food this is a good place to go as you can SEE what you wanna eat before you get it!"}
{"text":"This place is really not good. The buffet options are fairly extensive however everything I tried was passable at best. I'd say \"workmanlike\" in its attempts to please the palate. I tried one of their specialty lemonades which was supposed to be flavoured with Indian spices. It tasted like old dirty socks. As I just ate there about an hour ago, I'm hoping my stomach can hold it together long enough for me to have a soothing cup of tea at home. I most emphatically don't recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"I went for the lunch buffet with a friend. My experience here was positive. The food was delicious, service was prompt, and there wasn't a huge crowd.   I have also done take out as well and this is where i deducted a star. Take out can get a little disorganized."}
{"text":"Worst Customer service at Tandoor Flame Mississauga. Aboustle disappointing yesterday nighy from hostess and manager. The manager doesn't deserve to work there. Do not expect to tell of the customer to eat only 15 mins when the customer were here 9 pm and made us waiting for a very long time . This worst service I have experienced especially we are coming from far city."}
{"text":"I have been here twice now and it's probably one of the worst buffets in the city. I mean there's a huge variety and classic indian dishes, but nothing seems fresh. I've always left feeling a little sick. I like that there is a lot of variety and you get to try different indian dishes, but nothing for me really stood out. I enjoyed the pani puri but felt the tandoori chicken was very dry. I think indian buffets are just not something I enjoy as there is always this weird sickening feeling after I leave that I don't get with other buffets. It may be the excess oil and ghee that is used but I always feel like it's much more worthwhile passing on the buffet with indian food. To each his own though!"}
{"text":"Pathetic experience...Got cheated by Tandori Flame.. Had ordered large Paneer and they mixed with cheap quality Tofu.... Big cheaters..."}
{"text":"Good food always busy n noisy.Good service.But not worth the money you pay.Well who likes to pay 40bucks with a drink when u go in groups u would be shocked to see the bill.U can go here when u want to try many dishes but i find they dont have much varieties in nonveg n everything tastes the same"}
{"text":"Wow.  This was pretty spectacular.  Was taken there on the way back from the airport by some friends who live in Brampton.  Advertised as North America's biggest buffet and while I'm not sure about that, it was certainly well worth it.  Curries were good, naan was excellent, love that they have a pani puri and chaat station and that they have a wide selection of indian sweets.  All the western food I can do without but the rest was great.  Also I love the decor, all the Bollywood stars who've visited with headshots on the walls and the fabulous statues.  Definitely worth it."}
{"text":"Good Indian restaurant (I assume authentic because the patrons there were mostly Indian!) that had great food without being too spicy or past my taste buds liking.    Lots of meat and veggie varieties with a real naan oven and large grill pans.    Tasty! And I've been here multiple times.   Will return!"}
{"text":"Since we were venturing out to Brampton, I thought we should have an authentic-ish experience, and check out Tandoori Flame!  This place is insanely busy. We came on a Sunday at 9pm, and still had to wait about 25 minutes for a table. I wouldn't say its fancy, as it definitely had that buffet feel (hey, it's a buffet!).   We started the evening with their signature cocktail, which had a clever name I promptly forgot. It was a blended mango / chili drink, and for $7, it was a pretty good value. We then hit up the buffet, and everything was pretty decent! I was a little worried since we were going just an hour before close, but the food tasted fresh and there was a good variety of meat, vegetarian, and rice dishes.   While the service was a bit lack-luster, I really don't expect so much from a buffet. It didn't even seem like service staff existed - getting water was nearly impossible, and getting the bill took forever too.   All-in-all, I had a pretty decent first dining experience in Brampton."}
{"text":"One of the best Indian buffets in the city.  The food is very tasty and there's a wide variety of options to choose from.  Only suggestion would be to pay more attention to the Indian desserts as the current ones does not taste that good."}
{"text":"I have been to Tandoori Flame twice. Both times were for lunch with my team at work. One of my co-workers is a vegetarian. This place has dishes to suit her dietary needs.   This place has tons of curry selections. You can even choose from three types of rice, including chicken biriyani. The food is tasty and flavourful.   I was driving my manager and intern. They have terrific mojitos. I went with a virgin pineapple one, which had the perfect combination of pineapple, simple syrup, and mint.   There are plenty of desserts. Try the coconut cake. It is excellent! It's moist, has plenty of coconut, and isn't so sweet that you feel like your teeth are rotting.   With the mojito and the lunch buffet, the tab came up to $24. It's pretty good if you bring your appetite!"}
{"text":"This is a buffet style Indian restaurant during lunch hours. Plenty of choices to try from north to South Indian. They do have shock top beer, a pleasant surprise. Restaurant has plenty of seating space and is quite clean. Our server Ellie was phenomenal. I am definitely coming back again to try items from their menu."}
{"text":"Nice decoration, wide variety of dishes. They do have halal but only 4 dishes. Overall it's good but it could of been better and it's little pricy."}
{"text":"Had dinner. Lots of variety to chose from - chat, salad, veg, non veg and dessert. Food quality was average, not too impressive. Mango Firni was my favorite."}
{"text":"This is a ACYE place which has a great selection of Indian dishes which included curries, pakora chicken/fish, Hakka dishes, biryani, butter chicken, and more.   Came here for the first time for Sunday brunch.  There's just so many dishes which is great if you want to have the full experience of Indian cuisine.  The place had a very warm atmosphere with modern Indian decor and very spacious.  We manage to try a bit of everything and here are the items that are must try:  1) Chicken Pakora - nicely done! 2) Pani Puri - first time trying this snack and its delicious (you need to crack a hole on top of the hollow crisp deep fried cracker and stuff it with chickpeas & potatoes and pour spicy water) - see pic below 3) Butter Chicken - very good! 4) Goat with spinach stew -  I don't like goat but my husband and daughter loved this dish 5) Masala Dosa - similar to a crepe and this was my favourite! 6) Aloo Puri - spicy potatoes served with deep fried bread - tried this for the 1st time...personally it wasn't something that I liked but my daughter liked it  Overall, we had a great time and would definitely come back if we feel like Indian food."}
{"text":"This is our go to spot for Indian food. This place has a huge selection and their items from the tandoor are amazing. We've been to a lot of Indian restaurants in the city. Nothing like Tandoori Flame to hit the spot. PS - Order a King Fisher, and request Garlic Naan at the naan station."}
{"text":"Went for Sunday lunch(23rd June). For the price, very limited selections and many meat dishes were empty. Not a place for 18 dollars per person."}
{"text":"Yes, this is the Vinny Zucchini's of the Indian restaurant scene.  Is it authentic?  Nah.  Is there better?  Sure.  Is it overpriced?  No doubt.  But let's be honest for a sec - this was never the place for you if you're looking real, top-notch, cheap-as-heck Indian food, was it?  Tandoori Flame is a solid place for the family to over-eat."}
{"text":"Seeing how the famed Brampton Tandoori Flame buffet moved into my neighbourhood, we were able to convince a few colleagues to go here instead of our usual Indian haunts.  Considering this is pricier than our normal places to eat, we were hoping that the quality of food and quantity of options would be good.  Short answer... not really.  It doesn't compare well to the Brampton place and it also falls short compared to other Mississauga buffet options.  So the good is that they renovated the old Tuckers marketplace and it creates a nice clean atmosphere.  The 'cleanliness' didn't always translate to the buffet area though... I'm sure it's not the fault of the restaurant that their patrons have no idea how to use tongs only associated with that one dish or that people cannot scoop nicely and dribble everywhere (heathens I tell you!) but there should be a person cleaning the area quickly.  Mandarin does a good job of keep everything nice, neat, and pleasing to look at.  Here... not so much.  As for food options, I was disappointed.  We arrived on a Thursday at noon... no waiting as most of the restaurant was empty (maybe half filled?).  The options seemed quite limited and just stuck to the common things.  Sure they had the samosas (not super crispy and just lukewarm),  naan (soft and a little heavy handed on the butter), the usual curries (they were decent... not bad but worth the premium?  hm no), and grilled kabobs (they werent bad... not tough, not cold, but it was missing charred flavour!).  I tried a bit of everything but just found that I was missing the bold flavour that I normally associate with Indian cooking.  Perhaps they found their clientele wanting more muted flavour (I highly doubt it as there are tons of authentic bold Indian restaurants in the area) or they're trying to 'Canadianize' the food.  I'm not sure but it just wasn't wow.  The salads were not plentiful but at least they seemed fresh.  The dessert area was actually pitiful.  Unripe fruit sat next to overly soggy gulab juman (more soggy than normal) and I didn't even bother to look at anything else.    I rather go to Avani... at least they have wonderfully spiced fresh items instead of more amounts of mediocre options at a premium price."}
{"text":"This place is soooo good! Seating area is huge so it can accommodate alot of guests. We usually have a short wait when we come here but its worth it! Service is friendly and attentive always asking how our meal is and fillling up our water. We come with our son and they always have enough high chairs that are always kept clean.   I love the selection of hot food as well as the salad and dessert/ice cream bar. One time we came here and the staff was putting on a dancing show. They were dressed up and moved around the tables. Ot was amazing!"}
{"text":"First, let me preface this review by saying I've had many good experiences here over the years, which led me to make a reservation for 18 people.  Unfortunately I felt tricked -- my family was left to 'chill' in a cold, un-heated room and we ended up having dinner while wearing our winter coats.  We pointed out the cold when they opened the private room for us -- the host said, and I quote directly, \"Oh, we're just opening this room right now, we turned on the heating 10 minutes ago.  You're the only group here, don't worry more people will arrive and it will heat up.\"  Unfortunately that was a bold-faced lie -- no other people arrived the entire time our group was there, and the heating didn't work. The restaurant was packed, but our group was left in the cold in a large empty private room. We felt like they didn't really plan for our reservation (which we made days earlier and confirmed) so they stuffed us in a separate wing with broken heating (and yeah, we have photos of the thermostat and video of the empty room).  Of course they claimed to get a technician, but \"he's not here yet\" -- and of course he never came.  Though the restaurant attempted to make up for it by serving us complimentary hot tea, which helped, it was still \"too little and too late.\"  The server was clearly apologetic and embarrassed -- it certainly wasn't her fault, she was honest, hard-working, and meant well.  The rest of the staff was equally good, and the food was great.    This isn't the responsibility of the staff, is the responsibility of the Tandoori Flame Management.  Sure, they can't be perfect, sure, mistakes happen.  But would you want bring your family, your elders, your young ones, to dine in a cold room without heating in the dead of winter?  I wouldn't imagine so.  Again, I'm sure the staff is well-intentioned, and I have had good experiences here in the past -- but the experience we had this evening was un-excusable and left a bad taste.  At the very least, an apology from the manager or someone of stature was in order. Someone saying, Yes, we know you choose to spend your hard-earned money with us so you have a great experience, and Yes, we're super regretful that we were not able to give you the same experience as the rest of our diners because of our failure to plan and be good hosts.   Instead it was like, \"oh the technician is coming\" and \"oh yeah, running away now so we can pretend this is a non-issue.\"  Taking ownership is what we want to see -- not pretending that problems don't exist."}
{"text":"Went here on a Wednesday night and it was the worst experience ever. There was a small piece of a rock in the fish. I noticed it and told the waiter... He went to the room and came back and said they have informed the kitchen. When the bill came, another waiter asked me if everything was ok. When I said no and that there was a rock in my food, he apologized and said no one told him.      The food was limited selection and I am a fan of Indian food. The salad was basically lettuce. There was no parmesan cheese. Then salad dressing was thick.  The fruit selection was very limited (grapes, cantaloupe, watermelon and melon). Service sucked too, they were slow with water even though the restaurant was empty. Not a place I would go again or recommend at all. Don't waste your money."}
{"text":"Great ambience but poor costly food. Not worth going. Their Brampton location offering much batter food and choices"}
{"text":"When I was told we were going to an Indian buffet I wasn't expecting much. I had been to enough to expect poor selection and dry flavourless food. Imagine my surprise when we got there to find this huge restaurant with stations upon stations of all you can eat food! Good food at that!! The food doesn't compare to my favourite restaurant but I still give this place five stars because it is everything I could possibly hope for in a buffet. Fantastic."}
{"text":"This is mother of all buffets - and trust me you will not be disappointed.  Space and Ambiance: * The place is large and large statues at the front of traditional folk dancers are welcoming * Tons of seating, and they don't take reservation. * They close at 10 so make sure to get there early because you need a lot of time to eat all that food  Food: * They have something for everyone * Chaat station was filled with paapri chat, bhel and gol gappas (pani puri). * They have two stations of appetizer from everything from idli sambhar, selection of pakoras, samosa, tikki, to onion rings/fresh fries. * Naan were almost out so we asked them for fresh ones.  The fresh ones were out of the world. * Salad bar was big but less visited by the patrons.  Indians don't do well with Salad when they come to Buffet but regardless good to see there was an option * Desert selection included gajar halwa, kheer, gulab jamun, pudding, ice-cream to name a few.  I can't write about all the food available but you get the idea that this is the biggest buffet spread you will see.  As for the food, it is authentic, flavorful and reminds you of Punjab back home."}
{"text":"We visited this place for the first time when we had friends from out of town. It's a buffet. We all knew that so we came hungry. Their food is actually really good. The tastes, the cooking, the amount of different dishes, and the atmosphere all go well together. The service is on-point and friendly.   On the weekends they have HALAL options available so that works well. We went on a Friday night so we had some of those dishes and they were great. They list the names of the dishes and then there was a separate HALAL section.   All in all, great food and a lot of variety. You can sit there and eat so much that afterwards you will need to walk home to get some of that food digested. The spices are a bit more than some would like but with the tastes, they go well. Fresh, flavorful food!!"}
{"text":"WHOA .... I never seen a Indian restaurant so full of actual Indian people ... So it's gotta be good right? .... Well honestly I liked it ... But not all the dishes were that great ... Good thing it's a giant buffet so pick up a plate and try something new ... Enjoy"}
{"text":"OMG!!!! It's really THE Biggest Indian buffet I have ever seen. Literally with 150+ items including veg and non-veg, this restaurant certainly stands out as a unique one. Without compromising on the taste,  their biggest buffet offers wide varieties, excellent ambience, and the best hospitality. Yes  it is a must try! Just 3 words - Don't miss this!!!"}
{"text":"I already reviewed the Brampton location one, but I really like this one and prefer this one over the Brampton location. The Brampton location has more food options but all the stuff I like they have it here too and so I like it for the atmosphere and for the food! Very flavorful!"}
{"text":"I started recently Loving Indian food! But couldn't find the place to say I want to come here often.. until I stepped into Tandoori Flame. This place is Amazing! The flavors are Amazing, I just love almost Everything literally and they cook it fresh and the dessert is even Amazing! I live about Less then 10 minute drive from this place and I have to go to this restaurant at least once or 2-3 times a month here. Yeah, its that good! If you like Indian food and want a variety of other food. Come here! The one in Mississauga location is delicious as well.. I prefer the Mississauga location because of the atmosphere/ambiance but Both are good! I find the chefs at the Missisauga location a bit better but again both of them are good lol."}
{"text":"The most comprehensive Indian buffet I have ever enjoyed. Their alcoholic and non-alcoholic drink menus offered unique flavor combinations. I really appreciated the taste and consistency of the \"Jeera Masala Roohafza\" -\"a rose flavored drink with Indian spices.\" The curry goat, samosas, and potato tikkis were just delightful.  Beware the Naan Man (blue jeans with a blue button-down shirt)- several times, I was unlucky enough to be right behind him as I waited my turn to get some naan. It didn't matter if there were two or twelve pieces left. He took all of them, each time.  I wish there was a Tandoori Flame closer to home. My food experience was very memorable. I will definitely feast here, the next time I'm in the area."}
{"text":"had many a lunches and dinner here not the same experience this time.  it was not the service but it was more the food. Had much better Kababs here but  we all live and learn . Hopefully they get it better next time . May be i need to try a different location ."}
{"text":"Waste of money, I should have just gone to Panera Bread. Food quality has gone down drastically and the paneer dishes were horrible.  Never again!"}
{"text":"There is a lot on the menu, but I found only two things decent. The goat curry and the white ridicules. Pani puris are mediocre and rest of it, below average as well.  If you like quantity, go, if you like quality, you may have luck with one or two things. Over priced, but you pay for the wastage!!"}
{"text":"The buffet was nice and we have tried the yummy butter chicken and curry lamb, as well as varieties of Indian deserts."}
{"text":"If you want to try lots of Indian food at the same time, then come here. Butter chicken and curry seafood are my favorite."}
{"text":"I've had their take-out twice and it has been over the top excellent. Their Lamb Biryani is outstanding and their Chicken Tiki Masala is to die for.  Samosas are okay...very thick batter and heavily fried (Ive had better) (Best order for 3 people is One large Biryani, One Large Meat, and 4 of their big Samosas- comes to $10/person) Overall: Food= 4.5/5 Atmosphere= 4/5 Service= 4/5"}
{"text":"Very average food. Nothing extra ordinary about any of the dishes. There used to be a Tuckers Marketplace before at this spot, so they kept the same layout and decorations . I don't have much to say about this place. It's neither good nor bad."}
{"text":"Five stars for the ambiance, space and variety. Best Indian buffet place I've ever been to but the food isn't that great. The nana and curries could taste better. All the palak curries are good. Gajar halwa tastes like ghee. Overall a very decent selection of food."}
{"text":"My friends and I came here for lunch buffet on the weekend. They charge $21 for lunch buffet on weekends, which is quite a bit more than most other Indian buffets, AYCE sushi and heck even Mandarin. So what do you get for that kind of pricing? Well, it's apparently the biggest Indian buffet in North America for one. The selection they have is very good, the service was efficient, and the inside is very nice. The main problem is that none of the food was any good. I don't go to buffets with high expectations, but none of the food had any flavour that everyone has come to expect from Indian food. The naan was very chewy, and none of the desserts were enjoyable. You know you have a problem when the onion rings are the most enjoyable part of the meal. I'd have given the place a 3/5 for the food, but the fact that they charge way more than other places for very average food is a bit hard to swallow."}
{"text":"What's not to love about Tandoori Flame? Even my mom likes this joint, and she's not easily impressed. For her, paying for subpar Indian food would be like me purchasing a sack of flippant responses or sarcastic comments on Facebook walls. Anything I've tried in Toronto my mom can do better and for less. But when it comes to Tandoori Flame, even my hard-to-please mother gives them an old country thumbs up.   The selection is here unparalleled by any Toronto buffets. They've got a serious selection of appetizers, and two full banks of vegetarian and non-vegetarian goodies. The naans here are super fresh and tasty and constantly being refilled. I usually fill a whole plate with them on my first pass. (Yes, I'm that guy.)  For the adventurous there is killer chaat station where you can get savoury papri chaat or golgappa. This is a big deal, people. Do not skip the chaat station. And if you don't know what's what, just ask the nearest brown person to make you a plate. (If you see my mom there, she'll happily do it for you.)  Food quality here varies between awesome and better than awesome. I have never had an unsatisfying bite from any of their dinner stuffs. Great pakoras, fluffy rice, and really nice chutneys. Their saag goat meat is one of my favourites and I'm also a fan of any of their chicken dishes. I should mention to lovers of heat that none of the food is that spicy, but that's par for the course on a buffet. For me, the food is plenty flavourful.  Every restaurant has a weakness, and Tandoori Flame's is their lacklustre desserts. Their kheer is pretty boring, and I've had better carrot halwa. Oh, and don't even touch their galub jamun. It's awful. But they have your standard alternatives found in every buffet. I usually get the mango ice cream.  Though it can be quite the drive to Dixie and Steeles, their full parking lot and invariably out-the-door line ups are a testament to the quality of this buffet. Definitely my favourite in Toronto.  Obligatory Title Pun: Drop it like it's CHAAT.  Menu Readability: Professionally done. Excellent photos of their cocktails.  Need to mention: It's about $20 for their dinner buffet. They generally don't take reservations.  What this place teaches me about myself: If my mother likes the place it's gotta be good."}
{"text":"Excellent, all the food you stuff into your body, buffet.  A friend recommended Tandoori Flame to me as one of the best Indian Buffets they've been to that offers great tasting food without putting a huge dent in the wallet. They were right.  Service is very good and unassuming...plates are cleared quickly with little interruption and the staff really do seem to want you to enjoy your dining experience. They are very efficient and will only engage you in conversation if you're receptive to their approach.  The buffet is huge and tasty. Butter Chicken, Tandoori Chicken, Masalas, Pakorahs, Vegetarian dishes, Curry Dishes, Lamb, Naan Bread, desserts, fruit, etc....it's all here. If I recall, the waiter stated that there were over 100 items on the buffet but I think he underestimated the number substantially. Tons of selection to run the gambit of every taste.  Unfortunately, I've only visited this restaurant for lunch, but the 3 times I've been here I have yet to be disappointed. Although it can get quite crowded, the layout of the buffet is perfect to allow lines to move quickly. The food is grouped in \"sections\"...so that you can skip areas that contain foods you are not familiar with or are unwilling to try. Empty stations are replenished quickly and I have never gone to get a food item and it not be there.  Many people have a preconceived notion that all Indian food is hot and spicy. This buffet allows you to sample various levels of heat, combined with foods that are aromatic, textured, and cooked with spices familiar in Indian cuisine.  Highly recommend you try this place."}
{"text":"Came here over the weekend  with my  party for buffet.  The food was fresh and replenished often, The service was very good.   My recommendation is to avoid items you have already tried  and  try  something new from each station.   The cocktails are very good and the focus is on quality not quantity so they add alcohol to complement the cocktail rather than overpower it . I recommend the Mumbai Mango Mojito and the Strawberry Collins. I will return again and try different drinks .  Tips:  To maximize  the value  of the experience  and try a lot of everything :  1 Take   half a serving spoon of each curry,  one piece of vegetable or meat.   2 No more than one  level spoon or 1 naan  They will fill you up .  3  One spoon of appetizers  4 One  piece of solid desserts, or  half a spoon of liquid based desserts.   5  Once  you have tried whatever  you can  come  dine again on a different day and try what you were unable to try.  Comments: The  front area looks a bit  disorganized and the restaurant can benefit from having people place reservations for  smaller tables  of two to 5 instead of much larger tables being able to make a reservation. It  will help reduce the crowd that is there in  the  front."}
{"text":"I went to this place with a group of friends for my birthday and did not enjoy the food at all.  It was the least authentic Indian food I have ever eaten, and desperately lacked flavour!  The price was decent for a buffet considering the amount of food options available, but the food isn't good so it feels like a waste.   The decor was alright, the outside decoration is really nice, but the inside wasn't anything spectacular. It is good for parties though because its very big and has multiple rooms.   Overall, I think this place is WAY too overhyped, and definitely did not live up to the expectations I had."}
{"text":"Good selection of foods, great interior. Waiter service not exceptional, but OK for a buffet I guess. Will go back:)"}
{"text":"I would give it 2.5 stars.  Tandoori Flame has a large selection of Indian food, however, only a few dishes were good, the rest was substandard.  Butter chicken and goat curry were good, I did enjoy these two items. I was disappointed with the naan as it was cold even though we were there during lunch hours on weekend.  My hubby loves eating Gulab jamnun at Indian restaurants but their Gulab was soggy  Overall, its average quality, large selection of food."}
{"text":"I've been there a couple of times over the past couple of years.  I'm not an expert on Indian food, but I thought the overall variety was great, taste was good enough, and I liked the ambience.  Maybe I was eating too much (at least 3 plates), as I think I was being watched on an occasion, heheh."}
{"text":"for the price I think it's a great selection of a variety of dishes, nice atmosphere, decent service"}
{"text":"The king of Indian buffet. .. this is 3rd trip to Toronto to enjoy some delicious Indian food. My stops on the food trip to Toronto :- Tim Horton,  Maroli, Tandoori flames, Lahore paan and kashmiri tea, King dumplins, guru laxmi.  I love the buffet and the wide spread of Indian varieties at tandoori flames. The decor is modern-day Indian style, the wait staff is very friendly however very busy to attend each table as well. The punjabi food is finger licking good. Pani puri and chaat is average.  Pav bhaji is delicious but a bit softer Pav would have been great. Desserts are all delicious. .. soups are below average , should put up more variety!!!  Best dish - daal makhani. ... loved it.  Was disappointed that they didn't have idly or dosa but then my next stop was guru laxmi! !!"}
{"text":"Great buffet.  Lots of selection.  Has a good selection of vegetarian and meat.   Dosas are not bad.  Great if you are hungry!"}
{"text":"The best Indian buffet in town. There is a lot to like here and I'll always choose this over mandarin. Our visits have dropped dramatically though since we started seeking out al la carte Indian counterparts (and found a new fav). Good for families who may want some non-indian options as well (e.g., pizza/fries)."}
{"text":"My trip to Tandoori Flame marks my first time in Brampton. Bramp Vegas is a tasty place, let me tell you...   It's far from downtown, but it isn't far from YYZ and my pale pal and I were returning a rental car. Two other buddies did us a solid and picked us up from dropping off the rental car. We were starving, and the always savvy Kent P had Indian buffet on the mind. So away we went. Four wasps buzzing west on the 401 towards a mecca of curry.   $20 per head gets you AYCE of some of the best Indian food this tiny ginger has ever had on this continent. Their four types of paneer station lit up my heart and their goat saag was saagsational. I steered clear of the salad bars of pastas, etc, that looked reminiscent of my university cafeteria, but if you need to cut the eastern heat, they do have these more Canadian options.   Really a lovely evening... in a giant buffet box... in a parking lot in Brampton.   PEPPER POINTS: For their colourful cocktail list. The watermelon mojito was A+ if you are looking for something sweet, refreshing and manly."}
{"text":"Today my friend brought me to Tandoori Flame because he claims it's the best Indian buffet ever. I've never eaten Indian food before so I was hesitant to try it out...but I went in with an open mind and tried it.   When I walked in I was surprised by what type of customers were eating here. The majority of them were Caucasian and there were a few Indian families. I expected a large buffet but it wasn't that big compared to Mandarin.  The things that I tried were the bite-sized samosas (yummy!), naan with this orange and green sauce that had cottage cheese in it (don't know what it's called), tandoori chicken, butter chicken, and this orange rice (looks like fried rice). The food was good and I couldn't stuff myself after the 3rd plate...and this was when my friend was forcing me to eat more.  In conclusion, I would suggest this place to anyone who is looking for an Indian buffet to dine at. Also, I would come back here if I was in the area or if my friends invite me."}
{"text":"MUCH nicer than the Brampton location. I've only been here for lunch, but was satisfied with the selection and the quality of the food."}
{"text":"Oh Tandoori Flame! You really let me down this time. I'll preface this by saying that I've eaten here before and also eaten at the other location in Mississauga, and both times had a MUCH better experience.  That said, last night, Diwali, was my second visit to the Brampton location which we went to after the fireworks celebrations at a nearby temple.   We arrived around 9:15, but were never made aware that they close PROMPTLY at 10pm. By the time I got dessert, they had already removed the spoons from the desserts, so I had to use my own (a new one, at least) to scoop out the sad looking remains of kheer & mango pudding - SUPER unsanitary. The food from the rest of the buffet had already been removed, so heaven forbid I wanted one last scoop of something savory. For a +$20 buffet, they should wait until all guests have left to start taking the food & serving spoons away, or AT THE VERY LEAST, let us know that they'll be shutting down soon. Some of my friends didn't even get dessert and we felt VERY rushed! Also, because we were late in the service, many of the dishes (particularly the sambar) were COLD. Gross.   Our waitress was nice enough but we had to ask SEVERAL (like at least 10, I'm not even kidding) times for water. Eventually the man-friend grabbed water off of another table that had left - normally this would totally gross me out, but I got over it because of how thirsty I was and how tired we were of asking!   Lastly, paying the bill was its own debacle. We were a large group with split checks, which shouldn't be that tough. It's a buffet - everyone is charged the same! Yet we were charged $57 for two people, while another couple was charged $60 for two, and yet another $22 for one - the bills made NO sense. They also decided to add 10% gratuity, which I would normally be okay with. But we were at a buffet that shut down before we were finished and had overall HORRENDOUS service.    My advice: if you are going to go to Tandoori Flames, DON'T GO LATE! After last night's visit, I'm not sure I'll be returning ever."}
{"text":"Had their non veg thali to go.The chicken curry was amazing. Service was smooth and the price was reasonable for the serving size. The place looked clean and perfect for a sit down Indian meal."}
{"text":"Food is OK, sauces are a bit watery, meat dishes without much meat. Lots of variety, nice interior decor. Service is indifferent, prices on the website differ from actual prices, manager doesn't even apologise, points to sign on the wall with new prices ... bait and switch. Not returning."}
{"text":"Went there last night for dinner. The food selection was great and so was the presentation. The taste was good too. The service was good too. Overall it is great. Would go again!"}
