{"text":"Fantastic sandwich with real ingredients and reasonably priced.  Friendly folks and quick service."}
{"text":"Good turkey blt, was ready in a couple minutes even during busy lunch. Nice people. Solid lunch spot."}
{"text":"Best sandwich in uptown. Meatball sub with chips is my favorite. Come early to avoid the long lines'"}
{"text":"In order the Italian Chicken and it was good the chicken was moist and flavorful. Oregano is the main spice and luckily I like it. But there was nowhere to sit outside and it was am okay sandwich."}
{"text":"A fat kids paradise! The Ruben is bomb.com and the fresh cut fries are great. This IS a great place for sandwiches, burgers, fries, and cheesesteaks. This is NOT an appropriate place to order salad, really?? Salad?? Although I haven't had one, my peers say the cheesesteaks are indeed fabulous. Fast service and reasonably priced. A must try when you're Uptowning (Don't judge the vocab)."}
{"text":"Clover Joes is so good!! I never went to it when it was a food truck but I've been to the shop location several times and I'm hooked. The prices are very reasonable for what you get. I recommend the burger with bacon and cheese or the Reuben. They are both always so fresh and good. They have awesome fresh cut French fries as well. I've never had the steak and cheese but I've had many coworkers rave about it. I will be back again"}
{"text":"Burger patty was gross, prepackaged and way overpriced for bacon burger, 11.75 combo. Fries were awesome, bacon was good but disappointed overall."}
{"text":"After growing up in Pennsylvania and being raised on cheesesteaks, I was frustrated when I moved to Charlotte and could not find the real thing... until I was introduced to Clover Joe's. Hands down they have the best steak in town complete with the Amoroso roll. #1 in the Queen City."}
{"text":"Paul's Yelp Elite Rating: 4.35 Stars  I've been patronizing Clover Joe's for as long as I've worked Uptown, as they used to have a Food Truck across the street from where I work. Now they have their own shop in the Latta Arcade, and they have had the ability to expand their menu, and offer up even more goodies than what they were limited to in their truck.  To me, when I think of Clover Joe's, I think of NY ITALIAN SAUSAGE! In speaking with the owners, they import all their sausage fresh from Arthur Avenue in Brooklyn. Although I am not from NYC, this has a taste of \"home\" to me as I'm guess that all Big City Italian sausage makers use similar recipes, and this is what I remember the local Chicago Hot Dog/Beef/Sausage shops offering.....it's that Sweet Fennel that makes this sausage, and I LOVE IT!  So fast forward to lunch today, and I'm CRAVING that Italian Sausage, and Clover Joe's whips it up fast and tasty on a fresh Italian roll, complete with fried onions, green peppers and Mozzerela cheese. Nothing else is needed for this scrumptious sandwich. They also have fresh cut fries which are delicious (they didn't have a fryer in the truck so this is great that they can offer fresh fries now!). This sausage sandwich gets a PERFECT 5 YELP ELITE STARS from me!  They have many other offerings now too. Their burgers are good, but their Cheesesteak is REALLY good! Probably the BEST in Uptown! They always have daily specials, like Hot Italian subs, Reubens, Salads, and several other savory delights!  They do NOT have places to sit inside the restaurant. While they own the main floor, they also own the Upstairs space, and while the originally INTENDED to use this space as seating for their restaurant, they decided to rent it to a Yoga business. Apparently it is more profitable for them to do this. I understand that. But unless it's summer or warm out, you will have to take these goodies TO GO. Thus my 4 star rating.  But to be fair and clear, in COMPARISON to other similar sandwich shops, Clover Joe's is a 5 STAR establishment. It's a Mom and Pops operation and the food is delicious and affordable! Just have to take it to go.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!"}
{"text":"Clover Joe's is that great hidden spot in Latta Arcade for a good and reasonable lunch. From the Phillies to the meatballs to the chicken Ceasar salad, everything is delicious. The staff is friendly and the food is fast. For those Yankees, try the Italian chicken sandwich. As an Upstate New Yorker, I love chicken speidies (those who know the term know what I'm talking about!). Clover Joe's takes away my occassional homesick feelings with one bite of that deliciousness! SOLD"}
{"text":"The sandwiches here are amazing.  I went for the first time the other day with a group of co-workers and everyone liked the sandwhich they got.  I got the chicken sandwich with grilled onions and peppers and it was nearly perfection.  They use authentic Kaiser rolls popular among philly cheesesteak enthusiasts which really are an undervalued aspect of any cheesesteak.  Overalll a great spot and a hidden gem in uptown Charlotte.  I will be back!"}
{"text":"By far one of the best places in Charlotte.... They have the best philly cheese steak and roast beef sandwiches.   They hand cut their fries...they are off the chain...the owner is always friendly... I definitely recommend you to visit...Soooooo GOOD!"}
{"text":"Perhaps the best non-gourmet cheeseburger in town. That is to say that I have had one at another establishment where they used the best ground meat possible and you can taste the difference. They also charged me $15  But Clover Joe's Bacon Cheeseburger is exquisite. It is a perfectly seasoned large patty with Bacon, Cheese, lettuce tomato, ketchup and mustard. For under $8. If you are Uptown and craving a burger, it's a must have.  Burgers aren't your thing? Try the marinated chicken sub. It is out of this world also. I don't even know where to begin writing about it, you just have to try it.  Honestly, I can't say much else because this is where I stopped on the menu. I didn't need anything else. But they have Philly Cheesesteaks and a host of other sandwiches. I think their fries leave something to be desired but only because I'm not a huge fan of the soggy boardwalk style fries. Other people are.  Careful during the lunch rush. They make everything as you order it so with that quality comes a wait when they are busy and there is only ever 2-3 of them running the kitchen (that is all that can fit). If you have the time, it's worth the wait."}
{"text":"Giant hunks of meatiness! I tried the meatball sandwich, which was some pretty solid meatballs with a tasty sauce and cheese on a sub roll. I'm not a giant dude, so I could eat only half as my lunch.   Today, I went back and got their bacon cheeseburger with fries. The patty is thin for faster cooking, but at $7, you definitely get your money's worth. The toppings were plentiful and the tomato was actually very fresh and juicy too. The fries glistened with oil, but were crisp and tasted like they were fresh cut. Again, the portions were large and the food was quick, hot, and satisfying."}
{"text":"The best burger competition in Latta Arcade is now officially over and we have a clear winner.   Stopped in for a burger (asked for it medium well and love that it was actually cooked to order) got it with lettuce tomatoes ketchup and mayo. The ingredients were quality and the bun stood out as being fresh and delicious.  Pro tip- get an order of fries with your sandwich  2Â¢- can roll up and sit 2-4 on the patio but there is limited seating. Otherwise get it to go and find a spot at Romare Bearden Park"}
{"text":"Great Philly cheese-steak downtown at a decent price.  They also have fresh cut fries."}
{"text":"The middle age woman who works the register is so RUDE. I will never return to this establishment. In the past she has been rude with returning money and not being very pleasant. Today i ordered the fries and this woman tells the woman bagging food there is a 5.00 minimum going forward. She was being rude by not addressing me if she had a problem with my order.  You should never talk about a customer in front of them to another employee.   If you want to implement a policy do it before you open.   She should be glad to get any money she gets as it's allowing her to by clothes and food each day.    I will never return here. I can happily go to another restaurant and get healthier options."}
{"text":"The cheesesteak is alright, not good, and not bad.  I came in with high expectations and this probably set me up to be disappointed.  Even on an objective standard this is disappointing.  Cheesesteak for me falls into two categories - faithful to the Philadelphia cheesesteak or in the traditional of delicious beef sandwiches.  I would say that Clover Joe's cheesesteak is an attempt at a Philadelphia cheesesteak and it misses on a few notes.  That being said I am more of a fan of the delicious beef sandwiches school of cheesesteak.  I prefer a Jim's steakout cheesesteak to a true Philly cheesesteak.  I went to Clover Joe's based on the review by someone I admire.  This person did a great job explaining what specific background limited the knowledge of reviewer.  Breaking down Clover Joe's review: Value - 2/5.  For $7.50 I got 60% of the amount of cheesesteak I wanted.  The amount of toppings were minimal (very little pepper and onions, no mushrooms).  I may have been able to add lettuce and tomato, but I didn't ask this time around. Serving Size - 3/5.  Serving size is related to value, except that if there is just too much of a good thing then you lose out, and if the serving isn't enough to hit the exact size you want with a multiple of the items (1x or 2x, since you can't order 1.66x servings).  There is also a time component - if you order something not knowing if it will fill you up and have to order something else you lose time. Flavor: 3/5.  The sandwich had a rich mayonnaise like American cheese element, but the peppers were undetectable and the beef didn't carry many other notes than being a bit dry and salty (I like salty). Service: 3/5.  The people are courteous enough, the food comes out relatively quickly.  I went on a day where it wasn't busy so I don't know how they handle a lot of people.  They don't take Android Pay or Apple Pay, and the credit card process is a bit slower than other places.  They make a clear plea that you use cash by saying it is faster.  Cash shouldn't be faster, card should always be the fastest. Other: 3/5.  Location is easy to get to, the signage is clear.  If you aren't aware of how this part of town is setup (how this plaza is arranged) then you may have some difficulty as this is in the cut because you can't really tell it is here from the street.  Conclusion - in an incredibly competitive market segment (sandwiches, American) this is a reasonable contender.  I would go there if someone wanted to, but I would make sure to order something different or ask for extra extra onions and peppers.  I am going to keep looking for my must go place for cheesesteak.  Try the Rueben and let me know if that lives up the recommendations."}
{"text":"Dear Clover Joe's, because of you I crave a philly cheesesteak pretty much every week.   I'm not from Philly, I've never had a cheesesteak in the city of Philadelphia. So, I'm definitely by no means a connoisseur when it comes to this. I will say, it's a damn good sandwich at a damn good price. I'm a huge fan of the burger here as well. Their fries are hand cut. I always say I'm going to order something different here on my next visit, but I can't quite that philly.   This is a grab and go kind of place. There's only a couple tables and they are outside. I like to take my food over to Romare Bearden and eat in the park. If you don't work uptown, skip the parking decks and look for a spot on one of the nearby streets. The Park Mobile app makes it easy to pay and it's super cheap (it's like $1.12 an hour and you can add more time from your phone).  Take note: they are only open on week days til around 3pm."}
{"text":"Cheesesteak is either decent or really good when you order. Definitely has good days and bad days but great view and good prices grab your lunch to go and enjoy it over at the park"}
{"text":"Best sandwiches in Uptown. Best cheesesteak I've had outside of Philly. Chicken Caesar sandwich is also very good. Excellent fries. Love this place!"}
{"text":"Clover Joe's is hands down the best sandwich Shoppe in Charlotte! I work close by and this is my go to lunch spot they have a huge variety of sandwiches and they are all fabulous but my favorite wpuld have to be Joe's famous cheese steak!      You cannot beat the price and the service and experience has been wonderful every time I have been! I would recommend this place to everyone!"}
{"text":"A friend and I had lunch here yesterday. We couldn't decide what we wanted so we each ordered and split it so we could try both. The white tuna salad sandwich was the best I've had. The crunchy on the outside, soft on the inside bread was perfect for the sandwich. The tuna was chunks of white tuna instead of the tuna mush that you would typically get at most places. We also got a Cuban sandwich. I love Cubans! But this one was so good! Crunchy bread, pork, ham, pickles, mustard and Swiss. Mmmm. So good! The fries are hand cut, fresh and hot. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Delicious sandwiches. Wait time during rush hour have been 5 min or less. The shoppe is tucked inside the latta arcade next to the Rush Coffee shop. (Technically 2 doors down because the yoga studio entrance is sandwiched in between). Personally, I'm a Reuben sandwich fan and clover joe's Reuben has not disappointed."}
