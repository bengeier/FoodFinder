{"text":"Ma famille et moi sommes clients depuis leur ouverture il y a quelques années. Nous avons vu l'évolution complète de leur buisiness/local/menu. Je pense qu'ils ont changé de propriétaire, ou de staff ou de recette car le goût n'est plus pareille. C'est encore bon, mais moins. Je recommande quand même à 100% parce que c'est le fun d'avoir une alternative dans le quartier!"}
{"text":"4 stars. Not that it doesn't deserve 5...but its only i never rate any restaurant 5. We wanted a  poutine...so i tell my friends about a nice place near my house. Ate here 4 times already...so i tell them its pretty good. They loved it. Love how the place has a sports theme to it too. Wood panelling on the walls and decor give that distict charm of a laid back restaurant. Only wished that they had fountain soda available as well. Place like this needs to have refills available. Foods to good to have just 1 can of soda. Just a thought. Many varieties of poutines available. Just gotta come back and try them once every 6 months right? Like that they deliver also as well. Down to food...potatoes are very good and fresh. Just wish they can offer shoe string fries as well. I just think those fries make a good poutine. Lots of cheese,especially at the end of the meal. Rule of poutine dish-no leftover curds at the end means they went tight on the cheese. Sauce is good. Not the greatest. Had better sauce elsewhere, but i also like my sauce to be tangy and spicey at the same time. Thats why i would suggest having 3 varieties of sauces perhaps. So people if you are on the area do yourselves a favor and do stop here and have a poutine. If you don't then you might as well just regret eating that shit burger you go to McDonalds too and scoff down. Don't understand people. Restaurants like this are 100 times better thatn those scrappy franchises."}
{"text":"I'm sorry but I had an average experience. We were hungry and wanted junk food. Closest one to us. Very friendly waitress. Big smile and caring. Kitchen screwed up my order, hot dogs with the wrong condiments. It took forever to get a new batch. Order hamburgers, they're faster. I know poutine and this one was ok but the gravy is too thick. It doesn't flow over the fries. Cute spot out of the way. Next time I'll try the pizza. It might be faster (just kidding). :-p"}
{"text":"Super bon restaurant et à bon prix serveuse toujours gentille et bonne biere ! À aller grande variété de Poutine aussi et autre"}
{"text":"My son and I had a great meal here. The staff was super nice and friendly. My only negative comment would be that I thought the price was a little high. But we still enjoyed it!"}
{"text":"I'm rating this place strickly on the food from ordering take out. I have never actually been inside this restaurant.

Big selections of poutine, menu along with prices are available online. We've ordered take out serveral times and it was always delivered within a reasonable time. The poutines are delicious, I love the thick cut, twice fried fries, they are greasy and brown just like at la belle pro. Perfect for poutine, they absorb the sauce well. The toppings are delicious and generous. Strongly recommend the meat explosion and las vegas poutines.

Regular size is very filling, I wouldn't order the large unless you want to share. We also tried their hot dogs and onion rings, a little small but for the price not too bad.

Food comes in nice plastic reusable containers that can be microwaved as well.

No complaints!"}
