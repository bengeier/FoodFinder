{"text":"Really delicious burgers and fries. I've tried all the fries and they are addicting. My favorite is the sweet potato chipotle fries but the parmesan truffle are pretty great too. I've tried a couple of the burgers and they have all been great, but the Standard is by far the most delicious.   They also have pretty good drinks and fancy sodas, like strawberry ginger.  My only complaint is that they don't have normal flavored shakes, like chocolate and vanilla! The crazy flavors are fun sometimes but sometimes I want to go old school.  A fun, low-cost choice for burgers and fries! I definitely want to go back for brunch!"}
{"text":"We had a fantastic dinner here! I ordered mushroom Swiss burger and it was tasty. My sangria was also pretty darn food. The fries, though, we're the real stars of the meal! Our group split three  types: sweet potato with Sriracha mayo, Parmesan and truffle cream fries, and bacon blue cheese fries. Oh my goodness. I can't wait to come back for a few drinks and a lot of fries!!"}
{"text":"I've been back here several times since my initial review and I am keeping the rating at 5 stars because the Burgers and fries I've had here are so good.  Also the Cheese Curds are easily the best I've had in town (or at least tied for #1 with a select few other places).   I would recommend against the drinks however (I'm talking mixed drinks, the beer is still very good), the ones we had were weak and just not that tasty."}
{"text":"We have frequented D Lux many times since opening a few years ago and both my husband and I agree that the burgers are not as good as they used to be. The fries, cocktails and everything else about the burgers are great but the meat is very thin and over done. The atmosphere and service is great!"}
{"text":"This is the best burger I have had in town. I have been to dotty's and the old fashion. The place was crowded and I did not have to wait long. Me and my gf both got burgers and they were cooked perfectly. We also got sweet potato fries with the siracha aoli. That was great as well  The service was great, the crowd is generally 20=30 year old professional. The place looks more modern which is great if you want something different than the usual pub look."}
{"text":"Gourmet burgers on the square! Certainly the best burgers for blocks and blocks. Happy hour craft cocktails were nice at a great price. Appetizers were incredible with good variety of classic flavors."}
{"text":"Family's favorite restaurant. An upscale take on burgers, shakes and fries. Go early unless you'll wait forever.  The sandwiches and burgers are very flavorful and bring together new flavor combinations. Even the sides like the French onion dip and the fries are better than everywhere else.  I come for the shakes mostly. They are very creamy and have texture from the mixins. They are pretty small for a milkshake so you are not left with too much regret.  Best Madison restaurant"}
{"text":"Love this place for a lazy Sunday brunch due to their unlimited mimosa deal. For less than $10 unlimited mimosas is a steal. Good breakfast potato variations and decent breakfast sandwich options. Burger options are solid, and make sure to try all of their fry offerings."}
{"text":"Great milkshakes. Bartender didn't know how to make certain shots though, but was an excellent place to hang out and have a great time!"}
{"text":"Such an amazing experience this has to be the best roof top bar ever. The location is a right next to the capital building and the atmosphere is amazing. I had the apple slaw burger with the Cheese fries. Wow this was an amazing meal. Tessa the bartender recommended it and also recommended a few drinks that hit the spot. Overall the experience was a good one with delicious food, a nice view of the capital and an exceptional bartender, Tessa. Thanks for the experience in Madison. Next time I am in Madison I will be stopping here."}
{"text":"If you're looking for something super greasy, the brunch here is for you. Located on the Capitol square in Madison, Dlux is situated in a great location. My friends and I came here for their highly reputed \"bottomless mimosa\" brunch on a Saturday morning, and there were some nice parts of the experience and some less nice parts.   I'll start with the letdowns. Coming here on a Saturday morning, I expected the atmosphere to be calm and relaxing. It felt like a club, with the latest pop/electronic hits playing in the background. Also, someone had recommended the parmesan cream truffle fries, but they did not live up to my expectations. Over a span of 15-20 minutes, the cream sauce on the fries congealed in a non-appetizing fashion.   Other than those two things though, I enjoyed Dlux. The donut balls are great. The strawberry cream sauce that accompanied them was super tasty and complemented the indulgent fried dough balls. I got the spicy sausage breakfast sandwich, and the sriracha mayo sauce made the sandwich incredible. I would also recommend getting the sweet potato fries with the aforementioned sriracha mayo dip. I'm a little biased because I love sweet potato fries, but they're worth it.  The espresso milkshake was also great. Espresso grinds mixed in with ice cream. Simple and delicious. I didn't have the bottomless mimosas, but they're exactly what I expected: a little diluted but decent.  Overall, Dlux was a great place to dine with reasonable prices. Make sure to come before the brunch rush though."}
{"text":"I went here for brunch, and the make your own Bloody Mary bar definitely solidified a 4 star rating over a 3-3.5 range rating. Delicious garnishes! I was starving when we got there and had to wait for friends to arrive, so that definitely helped ;-)  I'm not a beef eater, so I was THRILLED to have the option of subbing a chicken burger on any of their burgers. A+ for that. While almost certainly premade and frozen, the chicken burger (with a fried egg) was absolutely delicious. The sweet potato fries are the best I've had (except for Alchemy, but theirs are very different) and a must have menu item.  The shake I had was absolutely delicious, although some of my table mates were slightly disappointed with theirs. We all got different ones, the Espresso one and Salted Caramel seemed to be the favorites. My main complaint is that for $5, the shakes are pretty small. I shared one with my husband (usually that is plenty), but it was tiny. Definitely not like going to Monty's and getting a huge metal cup plus a glass with shake in it. You are getting 10 or 12 oz at the most, don't get too excited. Everything else was very reasonably priced so it just seemed odd.   In sum, if I hadn't gone for brunch and gotten the Bloody Mary bar, I'd probably give this place a 3. The burgers are good, the fries are great, the shakes are generally good but overpriced for what they are. Definitely not your traditional \"burger and shake\" joint, I guess that is kinda their whole schtick, but it is a fun place for a weekend lunch or a casual week day dinner."}
{"text":"My daughter told me about a Yelp event at D-Lux a week ago. I am from Chicago. Do most yelping there. I read older reviews of D-Lux and they were hit or miss. I usually discount this as you either love or hate a place. For me, D-Lux is a hit. The samplings were great. Let's start at the beginning (food wise). The dips and chips were above average. The spicy corn dip was great. A big hit at our table. The crudite was artfully displayed and for this time of the year extremely fresh veggies. The drinks were varied and skillfully prepared by our bartenders. They were extremely helpful in describing their concoctions. Next came the fries and burgers. Now folks, this is NOT Donald's Mc Donald's nor is it Johnny's Mc Donald's. The place oozes modern chic. The food carries this theme in taste and presentation. The fries were crisp and prepared with delicious variations. The truffle and cheese fries were very good. The fries were something only an upscale restaurant would conjure up and deliver. The burgers were char broiled. Great start. I just love the taste of the charred meat of the burger. My favorite (I am a meat guy) was the fish plus burger. A great idea executed even better. Bring a few friends, order and share some of their varieties. We were getting filled on these tidbits and out came the shakes. Here again, not Mc Donald's. Thank God! We left satisfied and saying to ourselves, I will be back. Keep up the good work!  Johnny"}
{"text":"Bottomless Mimosas for $10 you cannot beat that. They serve you fast and do not skimp.   Never had the food but it looks good."}
{"text":"DLUX has a fun, hip atmosphere with decidedly mediocre food. You won't be upset by the fare, but you won't be impressed either. Standouts include their milkshakes and the buffalo chicken nachos. The burgers come with a variety of toppings, but are underwhelming. I understand why it appeals to the younger crowd because of the vibe, but c'mon, you can really get MUCH better and equally creative food at other establishments in Madison. If you're into bar trivia, however, they have a fun game on Tuesday nights at 8!"}
{"text":"DLUX does two things decently, in my opinion. They have a pretty solid brunch (with a $7 bottomless mimosa) and several good $6-8 breakfast sandwiches.   Second, they are a solid late-evening high class bar to stop in and have cocktails or a beer. That being said, the food isn't all that great, so I do not think it's a great restaurant to go for lunch or dinner. However, if you hit them for a Sunday brunch or Friday around 11:30 pm, you'll probably enjoy yourself."}
{"text":"Friday night out in Madison, WI started with dinner at Dlux.  A swanky, new place right off the square.  We started with drinks at the bar while the very short wait for a table.  One member in our party did not get her drink with the rest and very quickly someone came to our table to apologize for the delay and also tell her they were missing an ingredient and asked if there was something else she would like and that it would be \"on the house\" for the inconvenience and wait.  We were all impressed.   We all were very pleased with our meals and the bleu cheese and bacon fries were delish.   We had a very friendly, attentive and personable waiter in Trevor.   You need to experience Dlux, you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Burgers and shakes were pretty good although skimpy, no sides everything is extra.  This is a hip spot but expensive for students. clean lines very open, staff were nice.  But I can't imagine going back because it was so noisy,  I have never heard anything like it, the noise was deafening nobody could hear a thing."}
{"text":"Great food and atmosphere! Highly suggest the truffle fries and sweet potato fries with siracha mayo. Our waitress Dakota was engaging and friendly. Great stop by the Capitol!"}
{"text":"I would normally give them 5 stars, went in for brunch Sunday and we were told it would be a 40 min wait (which we were fine with and we had 8 people). But after 30-40 min wait we went to check to see how much longer it would be and I was told it would be another 40 mins at least. We ended up having to slip our group up and eat at different tables. Food was great and the manager was friendly. I also am only giving them 2 stars as I checked our bank account this morning and we were charged for our meal twice- we will be calling and hopefully this will be corrected- my suggestion is to check your bank account after your visit here."}
{"text":"Worst burger I have ever had. I got the southwest burger with green chilies, and it would have been ok if it weren't for the amount of salt. I'm guessing the burger had salt, plus the sauce, and extra seasoning sprinkled on the bun, to the point that it was crunchy! After giving up on it, I felt something strange in my mouth and realized it was a large piece of gristle. Overall it was disgusting enough that this will be my last visit."}
{"text":"I am really torn over DLUX. There are certain things I love about it and certain things about this place that really disappoint me. Proof -   Things I like about DLUX   1. The atmosphere is really stellar. Minus the 3 creepy paintings on the wall, I really love the decor. And I'm never terribly impressed with most Madison decor, but I love the reds and seating around a large, central bar. 2. AMAZING milkshakes. They are so damn good. Try the salted caramel. And you can make it \"boozy\". 3. Delicious homemade mixed drink taps. That's right. Mixed.drinks.on.tap. Delish. 4. Very clean space, very professional staff.  Things I don't like about DLUX  1. We were sat strangely. I went with a group of friends and they put us at a table clearly meant for 6 when there were 7 of us. That means 4 of us had to squeeze in on the booth side. Not cool. We were even there at an off time and it wasn't crazy busy. I would like to enjoy my food without bumping my neighbor.  2. Food is inconsistent. My friends really liked their burgers, but my breakfast sandwich was dry and mediocre.  3. Considering the crowd I also expected service to be a little more attentive.  Overall, I feel that DLUX could be really great if they worked on a couple of things."}
{"text":"After hearing all the reviews I really wanted to give this place 5 stars.  The atmosphere makes you feel upscale but in a very casual setting. The waiters/bartenders are up to par and are magnificently entertaining. DLUX is definitely the place to go if you want a nice burgers.  The menu is small which I very well like. Simple and to the point. Though it's small each and every dish is jammed packed with flavor. I ordered the DLUX burger and I was very happy with how everything tasted. Fresh and delicious. I also ordered the salted caramel milkshake since I've read that it was amazing from my fellow yelpers. And you know what? It really was! It was delicious!   The only downfall I had was my husbands orange creme soda milkshake. What you would expect and nothing really outstanding and the fries. Their fries were delicious but the parm sort of gave the fries a chalky after taste. My husband had the cheddar fries and yes they were great but next time i would ask them to go easy on the cheddar. Both fries are great when you first receive them but the cheese seemed to harden pretty quickly.  Overall, 4 stars. Atmosphere was incredible, staff was superb, food was delicious except for minor downfalls. DLUX, expect to see me again because you are well worth the drive."}
{"text":"A very hip place for brunch. I ordered the bottomless mimosa and they keep filling your glass if it gets a little low; this was honestly a bit overwhelming because it was hard to keep track of how much I drank. They also have a pretty extensive bloody mary bar with lots of toppings if you're into that kind of thing. The brunch menu is mostly sandwiches which all looked pretty good. Probably not the place to go if you want to get a huge amount of food for brunch."}
{"text":"This place has interesting burgers.  The patties are cooked the same way (done) and the flavors come from the stuff they put on the beef and not from the beef itself.  They are fun burgers and I have eaten three of them and will eat another one at some point.    Milkshakes are also good, but they are yuppiefied milk shakes.    I'm not quite sure what they are going for in terms of ambiance and theme.  The interior has this trendy vibe with red and black interior and low lighting but it also has this sports bar feel with the tv's.  Its' like it can't quite decide what they are going for.    This place is good and on a Wednesday night when Graze, Coopers, and The Old Fashion are all slammed, you can walk over and get a table at DLUX.  I'm not sure how Madison Mag had them as the best new restaurant in town, but it is solid."}
{"text":"Sunday brunch here is a must, bottomless mimosas is always a lot of fun!  I recently went for dinner for the first time and had a great experience as well.  I have yet to have a bad meal at Dlux."}
{"text":"Went last week on election day, had the Green Goddess salad, again, and it was great, again! Tried the sharp cheddar and green onion fries this time, awesome but not as awesome as the blue cheese and bacon fries I had the time before. They were giving out free root beer floats if you had your \"I voted\" sticker on."}
{"text":"Good burgers, great drinks. I've been here numerous times and never leave disappointed. On our last visit I had the backyard bbq burger with a fried egg added, my fiancée had the farmhouse burger...both were very good. The burgers are all priced at $8, sides are extra. We usually go with an order of the Parmesan & truffle fries...they are the bomb!  Their crafted cocktails are always perfect. Drink prices are reasonable for downtown, $5 to 8. Their tap list is about 8 beers but is filled with local brews. The downfall of dlux is that it's always busy. The place isn't the biggest either so plan on waiting for a table or even a spot at the bar. No over the phone reservations either, just plan on having a drink or two before your meal."}
{"text":"I've probably been here at least 10 times.  I work in the area, and it's high on my list for lunch.  The first thing that may be helpful to know about DLUX is that it's pretty much a lunch and late night establishment.  I wouldn't recommend it to someone that's \"going out for dinner.\"   You certainly could eat some good food during the dinner hours, but I think you can get the point.     I love the Pimento Burger -- check out the photo.  It's quite unique, but it's not going to make any simple folks uncomfortable.  The bell pepper jelly on it is fabulous.  I've tried all of their burgers, and I would not hesitate to order any one of them again.  The milkshakes are excellent.  Get the peanut butter, or the raspberry (I think it was raspberry) -- see the picture I uploaded.  The atmosphere is fresh, fun, and I'd even consider it relaxed.  The staff is pleasant and very attentive.    Why not 5 stars?  I think the meat on the sandwiches could use a little extra flavor.  There's just something missing.   Everything else on them makes up for it though."}
{"text":"Very surprised with all the fantastic reviews.  Burgers are decent, nothing more. They are very thin, and seem to all be cooked to the same doneness. The bread overpowers it, and makes the burger look much more extravagant than it actually is. I would estimate the burgers to be no more than 4oz.   Fries were okay. Red velvet shake was too sweet, and very liquidy. Totally not worth it."}
{"text":"A bit disappointed on my second trip here.  The waiter was totally out to lunch. Not sure if he's a brick short or if he's just bored.  The food was ok but not like my first experience a few months ago.  Hopefully they're just having an off night."}
{"text":"Every time I come to Dlux I have an amazing time but this was not even close.  I know they do not take over the phone reservations but usually if I am five minutes away they will put my name on the list.  The hostess said she put my name on the list and I would have a table when I arrived, of course, they have no idea what I'm taking about.... Then a table opens up and they tell me it is held for a reservation coming in.... Doesn't make too much sense.  Besides the stupid host staff out server was great and so was the food.  I always stay with the sausage breakfast sandwich! The apple butter is to die for :)."}
{"text":"Booooooo... 2 stars are for good service and ambiance. Perhaps if DLUX had saved some of their decor budget on fresher ingredients, I wouldn't be scornful of my grey beef patty and blatantly processed \"Southern fried chicken\" sandwich. Hey-maybe they could've even afforded enough letters to spell out deluxe properly."}
{"text":"My husband and I love DLUX! Have never had a bad meal there and I love the atmosphere!"}
{"text":"I think that my first review was spot on, but DLUX has improved A LOT since then.  I went back tonight for a birthday party, and I was thrilled by the improvement.  The bar is still beautiful, and the lighting and music was much better.  While the staff was fine before, the service was much crisper and more professional.    I was really expecting DLUX to fall flat, so I went for broke with the cabbage soup...yep cabbage...and the green goddess salad.  Both were delicious!  I was shocked at how much I enjoyed both of them.   We also had a red velvet milkshake which was much better than either of the two milkshakes that we had tried before.  This was the kicker for me:  We ordered our dishes without meat to be vegetarian friendly, which was not a problem for the waiter.  When we got our bill, we noticed that the price had been reduced because we didn't order meat.  No vegetarian expects to have their bill reduced for holding the meat, but it is really REALLY nice to see it when it does happen.  Thank you."}
{"text":"GREAT SERVICE!  Love going to this place, fun atmosphere, great food, AMAZING service! Eric was our server, he was wonderful also the management there is great. They mixed up my fry order, which wasn't a huge deal because all the fries are tasty, but Eric fixed the situation immediately and one of the managers, I think her name was Amanda stopped by our table to apologize and made sure that we were happy with our meals. Not to mention, they bought my fries! Score! It's those little things that make this place so great!"}
{"text":"I am so obsessed with DLUX. I've been here for dinner and brunch and both are excellent. All of the burgers are delicious and really reasonably priced. Do yourself a favor and get the parmesan and truffle fries. Actually all of the specialty fries are awesome, but those are by far the best.   Milkshakes are also awesome. I had the toasted marshmallow and it may have been the best thing I've ever eaten. It even came with two actual toasted marshmallows on top.  Brunch is simple but delicious. You can get the same fry options on your breakfast potatoes and they are just as good. Plus they have $10 bottomless mimosas which is basically all I want out of life. Shout out to Jamie who is our waitress almost every time we (get obnoxiously drunk) eat brunch there. She's great, super friendly and efficient. She keeps the mimosas coming so we love her.   Overall, a great place for dinner or brunch. Friendly quick service, quirky/artsy atmosphere, and delicious food for cheap. Daaa best. Plus their patio is nice in the summertime."}
{"text":"Perfect place for a tasty meal at the perfect price.  I tried the kegged cocktail - the DLUX Double Punch (not to be confused with a discount double check).  It was sublime.  My partner and I had burgers - both done just right.  We also tried the cheddar and green onion fries.  Oooh.  Those were good.  I wish we'd had room to try one of the shakes - but I suppose it's just a pledge to return.  (Also fun/swanky ambience - I like how they've hidden the TVs way up high so they aren't a distraction)."}
{"text":"I'll keep this short and simple. This place is amazing. From the food to the service, DLUX never disappoints. Burgers are packed with flavor and you must try their fries. Parmesan and truffle cream's my favorite. And you CAN NOT leave without trying on of their milkshakes. They put all other milkshakes to shame! Personally i love the Salted Caramel Pecan but you really just gotta try them all. These shakes are no joke and they're packed full of incredible flavor.  Also, be sure to ask for their burger and shake specials!!"}
{"text":"I like a menu that has limited choices. However, if you're menu is limited then what you make needs to be outstanding. Both of our burgers were dry as were the buns. The egg on my burger was over hard. In all my times of ordering a \"dirty\" burger, I've never had the egg fried hard. The point of the egg is for the yolk to soak into the bun and run over the meat. The truffle fries were a miss with the sauce tasting more like an Alfredo. We ended up sending them back and asking for plain fries suggesting maybe they were soggy because they sat too long. Server was pleasant and the wine was good. We won't return."}
{"text":"Ok, so I dropped in for the first time at lunch time.  I'd been excited because of my perceived dearth of great burgers in Madison.  I took a seat at the bar, my preferred seat in most restaurants, and was surprised by it's size.  It was a large squarish bar in the center of the room that takes up a considerable amount of floorspace - more than I would expect for a restaurant.  The decor, which is slick and mod, tells you that Dlux is really a fancy cocktail lounge that serves burgers.   And if I were judging it as a lounge, my star rating would probably start at 4 stars.  Beautiful space, nice bar, good stools - a great start. However, I'm judging it as a burger spot, and as such it's absolutely a three star kinda place.  I had \"The Standard\" which is what it sounds like: American cheese, lettuce, tomato, onion and pickles. I also had sea salt fries on the side. They have a number of other burgers but I wanted to give them a shot at the classic.   The food came hot which was great. The plate was very attractive as they have their own custom dlux plates.  I guess my main complaint is that the patty is too small.  I'm guessing five ounces before cooking.  It was dwarfed by the bun, which was a good potato bun.  You can order a double if you want, which pushes the price up from $8 to $11, no side.  Pretty steep for lunch. Everything else about the burger fine.  The veggies were fresh, but that's not why I would go back for a burger.  The fries were also a little off.  They were hot, but a little chewy or tough and barely salted which isn't great when you call them sea salt fries.  They had the texture of a stale french fry but were not.  I'm guessing it has to do with their cooking process combine with the fact that the potatoes seemed to be fresh cut, which is admirable when it produces a better product.  Here it didn't.   I should also mention that the service was fine.  The bartender was a little disinterested, but I've worked the lunchtime shift behind the bar myself in a former life and I get it.  It's not the greatest shift, but she kept my glass filled and my lunch came promptly.  I'll take that anytime."}
{"text":"Not thrilled with DLUX.  I went in last night with a group of friends and we were seated right away, which was nice until nobody looked our way for the next 20 minutes. Nobody brought water. We didn't see any servers, so we thought maybe we should order at the bar as it was around ten pm and perhaps past the normal time for dinner service. We asked the bartender if we would be getting a server and the bartender said yes, the server was just really busy because they only had two servers. We asked if we could order at the bar since the server was busy and she said no, we would have to wait for the server. She did get us drinks and water, but then we had to return to the table to keep waiting for a server that may or may not come.   When the server finally did arrive she was very pleasant and our food arrived in a timely manner after ordering it. I had the sunrise burger and sweet potato fries and I was underwhelmed. Nothing was especially impressive about it.   It might be awhile before I go back to eat average food with subpar service. There are a lot of burgers in town and dlux doesn't really seem worth the trip. A couple of my friends had milkshakes and raved about them, though."}
{"text":"My wife and I went here on a Friday and we were able to get a seat at the bar right away.  It was our first time here but it won't be our last.  The food was good and the drinks were mixed perfectly.  With that said, while this is a 'burger joint,' it's shooting to be a burger with 'class'.  These are not \"juicy burgers\" with the juices dripping down your forearms as you take your bites.  The burgers are pressed and therefore they only cook them to one temp.  I am a Medium Rare kind of guy and hate a dry burger, yet these folks were able to keep their creations moist while being medium to medium well.  This is definitely a cocktail and tidy chef made burger vs a juicy, greasy beer and burger place.  My wife ordered the Farmhouse burger and I ordered the Sunrise.  She really enjoyed hers, and while I did like mine, my only complaint would be that I wish the egg had been cooked sunny side up, so that the yolk would be runny as I bit into it.  These chef creations are unable to be substituted per their menu, but I wish they would create a blue cheese and bacon burger.  We each ordered their french fries with cheese, I got the...blue cheese and bacon fries and she the sharp cheddar and green onion.  Her only complaint is that they add a base layer of 'cheese sauce' under the actual cheese and onion which can make the fries in the middle and bottom overly soggy and mushy.  Great bartenders, wonderful mixed cocktails, and a perfect place to take a date and still enjoy a good burger."}
{"text":"I had a very bad lunch experience at DLUX. I've been told that doing burgers this way -- every burger grill pressed to well-done -- is a matter of taste, but I just don't get it.  I had the Farmhouse burger, cheddar-chive fries and a Shot In the Dark kegged cocktail. The tomato jam on the burger was nice and most of the condiments were good, but didn't make up for lack of a flavorful patty. The fries were pretty generic and there was not much flavor in the cheese sauce.  The cocktail was the low of the experience. It was overcarbonated and extremely sweet which gave it an acidy burn. This was not a nice alcohol warmness, but physically painful. I had to send it back."}
{"text":"I've only been to DLux twice, both times for lunch.  My first visit I had the chicken burger (well prepared and very moist) and shared an order of the parmesan & truffle fries which were sinfully delicious.  My second lunch trip I ordered the South by Southwest salad with chicken.  Great salad, except the roasted poblano ranch dressing was extremely bland.    Service seems good, and the lunch prices are reasonable.  I'd definitely return to DLUX."}
{"text":"After having a bad experience in DLUX and writing the review the manger nicely responded and said he was truly sorry for the service and gave a gift card! When we arrived today the atmosphere and ambience was great! The service was good! This time we were served by a nice and friendly server! The food was really good with some great options! I'm glad I gave a other chance to DLUX!"}
{"text":"Best burger and fries in Madison. A must try if you live in Madison. I dream about their French fries they're so good. Check it out!"}
{"text":"Went for a work meeting. The milkshakes are amazing! I would go there for a milkshake alone! I thought my burger was great. You purchase your side separate from the burger. I thought the portion of the fries were a bit smaller than usual, however, it was  perfectly sized for me! Love the dipping sauces that come with the fries!"}
{"text":"I had recently eaten here on the recommendation of a family member who had previously been here.  I was disappointed on several levels.  Upon entering, it was designed for a hipster crowd, with the staff dressed in blue jeans and our server with high laced work boots.  Not what I was expecting!  Also the atmosphere did not relax me at all.  I immediately noticed some rather odd and glaring red blocks of light displayed on the back wall.  In addition to this there was some new age music playing in the background that I found unsettling.  Upon ordering, I settled for the Inside Out Burger and some fries with sour cream. cheese and bacon bits on it.  The burger was basically a beef patty placed inside two pieces of bread with some Gouda Cheese grilled on the outside of the sandwich.  It tasted OK but was nothing to write home about.  The fries were a rather small quantity and seemed somewhat pricy for what you received from the wait staff.  While the location is great being near the State Capitol; I feel that this restaurant plays to the busy lunchtime local business and college crowd and does not really focus its efforts on attracting nor catering to other  diners from outside the city."}
{"text":"First time at Dlux, and for the most part I was happy. The fries are stellar and we shared two different small orders. The burger was good...well done, which I would have preferred a little pink, but still good. The weird thing was, the bun. It tasted and looked pretty much like a regular old, white bread bun from the store. It wasn't toasted or grilled, and didn't seem to go with the gourmet burger (mushrooms, Swiss cheese, truffle cream sauce). It honestly really affected how much I enjoyed the burger. There is nothing like a toasted bun. Or even a bun of higher quality and flavor than what I would buy for a backyard BBQ. Next time, I'll have to try the shakes that everyone raves about.   Update: they got new buns! Hooray! And I tried the chocolate peanut butter pretzel shake. Holy yum!"}
{"text":"I have been here many times in the past 7 months. The farmhouse burger is fabulous, love the sauce that comes with the sweet potato fries and saving room for a shake is a must! Remember you can order your burger the temp you want. The first few times I forgot, now it makes it perfect! Great for date night, dinner with the family, groups, any occasion."}
{"text":"The red velvet shake is very good and I also had the fried pickles and the blue cheese and bacon fries and they were also very good."}
{"text":"If you're gluten sensitive or trying to be healthy, not many choices. But the mimosas are great :)"}
{"text":"DLUX is conveniently near the Capitol. Had dinner with a colleague last month on a Friday for dinner. It was definitely crowded but luckily we were offered seats at the bar. I ordered cheese curds, the green chili burger, and chocolate peanut butter pretzel milkshake. As it was a stressful day, DLUX was definitely much appreciated. Cheese curds were tasty as well as the burger, but the milkshake was the most memorable. Service at the bar was a bit slow at times, but friendly. The noise level was a bit above average, but love the vibe and decor of the restaurant. Would definitely go again."}
{"text":"Ok. Sweet Potato Fries. SWEET POTATO FRIES WITH SRIRACHA MAYO. So delicious. All the other fries are also delicious and it won't break the bank for you to try them all so I would really suggest it. At just 3$ a side of loaded fries, it's totally worth it. The burgers all sound amazing so it was difficult to pick, but I think it's also difficult to go wrong. My problem with it was that, as some other reviewers have noted, you can't really personalize the cook on the burger. More than that, you can't really customize the burger as much as I'm used to. No substitutions or additions really. I had the farmhouse burger, and even though the tomato jam was on the side, it just didn't go with the burger at all for me. It was waaay too sweet, and if you know me at all, that's not really something I say. Still, I've never had a fried green tomato on a burger, so good on them for creativity. Honestly, looking at the menu now, I must have had some sort of brain aneurism cause some of the other burgers sound way better. The decor is quite modern but very comfortable, and the service (at least at 3 pm) was extremely on point. My server brought me a free sample of milkshake because they were training a new waitress, and all I cant say is, next time, I'm ordering a full milkshake. I walked by once during a brunch service and i if I'm ever back in Madison, I want to do that. a DIY bloody bar sounds amazing. I love me a good spicy briny bloody. Also, bottomless mimosas. Come on. Havent tried the brunch yet, but overall I would put one greasy thumb up for this place."}
{"text":"Not a fan. The food is scant at best. The only thing keeping this place going is their rare drink specials, such as Sunday mimosas."}
{"text":"Came here with my family of six and was unsure what to expect! What we found was an upscale burger place that was extremely affordable and equally delicious. We sampled from the appetizers, burgers, and milkshakes- all SO GOOD! Perfect for a date night or a night with the family! Peanut butter pretzel shake was superb."}
{"text":"Bottomless mimosas. Till 3pm weekends. I like that they set boundaries (see attached photo) Good service. Pleasant staff. Matt is the best. Very helpful and pleasant. RECOMMEND."}
{"text":"Great spot for brunch (yummy food + bottomless mimosas) or dinner and drinks (yummy food + 2for1 drink specials). Basically, if you're a fun foodie, go here."}
{"text":"Just moved to Madison, didn't want to eat at a chain place so we decided to head downtown. Actually saw this place on yelp and decided to try it. We ate on the patio but the inside seemed pretty busy on a Wednesday around 8pm. My boyfriend and I ordered bbq bacon coleslaw burgers and shared a cheddar green onion fry. Food came out fast.  Service was good. Our food was super tasty. Burger cooked perfectly. Bacon cooked perfectly not hard and not slimy. Coleslaw was so good and I really don't even like it in any other instance. Fries were so good and unique. We were pleasantly full. Under $30 for 2 burgers, 2 cokes, and a large fry. I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"If you get the french onion dip make sure you love onions. It is large chopped up onions in a cream sauce. Chips are delicious but sauce was not edible. Bring a breath mint if you want to enjoy! Haha."}
{"text":"This is one of our happiest places in Madison. Everything is just plain delicious with interesting variations on classic things to make it seem like a special occasion. Nice staff, great prices considering the high level of execution and attention to detail."}
{"text":"The red velvet milkshake just exploded in my mouth! Super crazy delicious it's a must! The burger is one of the beats I've had along w the seasoned chips. Super excited to come here again!"}
{"text":"S'Mores Shake with alcohol in it?  Bloody Mary Bar? Need I say more? Need I?"}
{"text":"This place used to be our regular haunt but now we find ourselves going to other of the many burger options in the area instead.   Why?  On our recent visits the burgers arrived lukewarm and dry while the fries were greasy and soggy.  Their milkshakes have remained constantly good though.   We do appreciate the interesting twist to your typical hamburger but the meat pattie could use a little revamping."}
{"text":"The shakes were definitely the highlight of our meal.  We tried the salted caramel pecan and the toasted marshmallow, they were both incredible!  The fries were also fantastic although the fries in our parmasan and truffle cream order were a little undercooked (I like thick cut fries crispy). The burgers were just okay.  Don't get me wrong, they were good but for $8 and compared to everything else we tried, they just didn't stack up.  I would probably skip the burger next time and order soup or salad.   No complaints about the service and I did enjoy the ambiance."}
{"text":"People go here for the unlimited mimosas (which is great, especially because it's the only place in Madison that does this which is sad for many reasons) but that's pretty much all I would recommend it for. The food, while delicious, consists of a few \"burger\"-type items with a few sides. They also have some delicious boozy milkshake items. The decor it what gets me, though. It's like they tried really hard to be super contemporary and also kind of asian clubby but missed the mark on both or whatever kind of combination was supposed to happen, so it ends up just kind of tacky."}
{"text":"Here's my beef:  1) These guys advertise themselves with this motto in tow: \"Burgers, Cocktails, and General Swank...\" The thing is, if you have to advertise the presence of swank in your establishment, there's some trying too hard going on. It's sorta like having to explain a joke after telling it. I've had to explain jokes before. It's not cool...or swanky.  2) I ordered a cocktail while seated in one of their booths and when the waitress delivered it, there was a fly hanging out in the bottom of my glass. The waitress was super apologetic about it when I introduced her to my dead, floaty friend but I was turned off nonetheless.  3) Tipsy Cow, Graze, Merchant...they're all right down the street. And they will serve me a burger medium-rare. That's considerate.  Real talk."}
{"text":"The breakfast mushroom sandwich is amazing, and the bottomless mimosa is well worth the price. I would recommend adding a few more vegetarian options to the brunch menu. My husband and I only had one option to choose from. Otherwise, we will be back to enjoy the atmosphere, breakfast potatoes, and cocktails! It was well worth our visit! Oh, and prices are reasonable."}
{"text":"Review is for how they treated us here.  We stopped here after the farmers market last weekend.  Hostess refused to seat us even with empty tables in the restaurant and outside.  A member of our party stayed behind to find out why and she heard them comment about the fact that we had our 5 year old son with us.  Sorry, but we were here during the early daylight hours, not at night, and this isn't fine dining (where we know not to bring our son).  Won't be going here even for an adults only night anymore.  Guess if you like being greeted by snotty millennials who smell like patchouli and hemp, then this is the place for you.  We went to the Great Dane where they were happy to have us."}
{"text":"After a less than stellar experience at DLUX, the owner, Caitlin reached out to me and invited to come out for a couple of cocktails.  I'm happy to report that I had a much better experience.  For those of you that have complained about the cocktails being too sweet, make sure to speak up!  The bar is happy to customize most drinks to make them less sweet or your server can help steer you in the right direction.  If you're like me and love bourbon, get the bourbon smash (less sweet, of course) and you'll be very happy.    OH! and please try the sweet corn dip with fritos.  I'm in love with that -ish and need to recreate it at home (or go back and order it again and again)."}
{"text":"I ended up coming here because Graze and other sit down restaurants had long waits that night.  I'm going to describe this place as a very hip, sleek, modern burger joint. I mean I understand the demographic may want burgers but I was shocked when I saw the menu.  I tried to fight the system and have a salmon sandwich. Was ok. And what are these reviews about incredible sweet potato fries? Can you even mess those up? Here's the secret: they're fried.  I will admit they may have some of the best bartenders though. Extremely attentive because they don't just allow the mass of people in. Great service.  TL;DR - take a date here if your lady is into good booze and a burgers..."}
{"text":"I'm not going to lie, I've only been here for brunch, but it's a fun trendy brunch place! The parking situation isn't great with it being so close to the capitol, but it's worth the walk. Also expect a wait on Sunday mornings, because it's always busy. It's well lit with their huge windows and has cozy big booths. You come for the $6 Bloody Mary bar (lots of options for seasoning and fixings) or $12 bottomless mimosas (time limited, they need to turn tables), but the food is good too. They don't serve anything too fancy - simple breakfast sandwiches (only $8) and breakfast potatoes (only $3 - multiple cheese & flavor options), but they're very satisfying. They have great sandwich flavors including spicy sausage; bacon, egg & cheese; philly steak & hash; chicken fried chicken with gravy; and my favorite - portobello mushroom with Swiss cheese and truffle cream sauce."}
{"text":"Great place to go to dinner the burgers were great and also we have a milkshake and it was delicious..it was also very affordable I will be back :)"}
{"text":"I've been to DLUX a couple times in the last couple years on another's request. I'm generally not initially thrilled with the idea of burgers if I'm going downtown, however I haven't been disappointed with DLUX. I would prefer to reserve the downtown burger for 1or 2am (Plaza Burger).  There are multiple burger-alternative-burgers offered. The falafel could use some crunch or other diversified texture aside from squish (multiple veggies, sauces, falafel making bread soggy too), though the flavor is there (mmm tzatziki). Cheese curds look great; I hope to try these little bundles of cheese-joy next time. DLUX offers fun, innovative milkshakes but I can't vouch for flavor as I haven't experienced these myself (need time as well).  Burgers and drinks are priced fairly, particularly for just of the Square. Although not included, sides are inexpensive and given in large portions and multiple varieties. Staff has been okay. At one time, DLUX offered trivia but trivia in Madison is always changing so definitely check that out first."}
{"text":"Great food, great drinks, great ambiance all at an affordable price.  My favorites of the evening:  Green Goddess Salad, Margherita Chicken Sandwich and Sweet Potato Fries.  Ended the evening sharing a Salted Caramel Shake.  Delicious!"}
{"text":"Our food was pretty good - most of us either got a burger or a chicken sandwich, all of which were good, but not great.  However, our service was phenomenal and would keep us coming back. Our servers made great drinks, were personable, and very attentive. We were pleasantly surprised to find out that after a mistake was made on one of our orders, that meal was comped by DLUX (which was totally unnecessary, but very much appreciated)."}
{"text":"I'm so very in-between when it comes to DLUX. Its positive aspects are not so courteously complimented by negative aspects. I'll start with the negative to end on a positive note.   First off, DLUX is again and again rated as one of Madison's top burger joints but I just don't see it. Yes, they have a heavy selection of different burgers and fries, both with various toppings but just because there's a diverse selection, doesn't automatically make the food phenomenal. Applebee's offers a wide selection and, well...you know. Don't get me wrong, it's not horrible but I just don't see it worthy as one of the top three places for BURGERS in Madison. There's no choice of preparation, they're all broiled through and the flavor is meh.   When it comes to fries, I've also had a few of their selections and once again meh. The parmesan truffle-cream fries were quite soggy. I understand, truffle cream is stated in its name but coming from a truffle lover, the cream aspect took so much away. Toss those suckers in truffle oil after they've been fried to a crisp glory--but that's just a personal preference.   Anywho, I thought their brunch menu was a lame selection, mostly basic, meh sandwiches with a very small entree selection. I get it, their specialty IS sandwiches but come on, I feel like it's appropriate to mix it up a little when it comes to brunch.   This is also where it starts to turn for the better.....   To make up for their lacking brunch menu, DLUX offers a fatty bloody mary bar with toppings galore. YES PUHLEASE.   And what else goes hand and hand with a successful brunch? MIMOSAS, they serve bottomless mimosas, $12 per two hours, I'd say that's a reasonable time limit to gobble down as many mimosas as possible.   They also have a killer happy hour, until midnight on Friday and Saturday nights. Two for one drinks and that include basically anything, wine, beer, cocktails...even double mixers. You can certainly do some work in that time span. DLUX does have a cool late night vibe,that red, back-lit wall is a staple. Being located right off the square and close to all the cool happenings makes for a great starting point to get the engine revving or just a simple chill spot. Typically, the bar is surprisingly not overcrowded like many of the other surrounding establishments. The bartenders have always been more than accommodating and tolerant of my shenanigans, and usually even willing to have some fun with you!   Finally, those shakes, boozy or not, up the ante just a tad more. There's a selection of five or six, with flavors like salted caramel or red velvet, made with Sassy Cow ice-cream. The bartenders are always prepared with a great alcohol pairing to accompany if that's your cup of tea....or milk...heh. heh."}
{"text":"This restaurant just makes me happy to go to. They're known for their milkshakes (you can add a shot to them). Another favorite is their cheese curds. Decently priced and good. Cozy atmosphere with lots of circular booths"}
{"text":"I love DLUX! This is the burger place that Madison has needed for such a long time. If you're bored with the same old greasy burgers served around the downtown bars, then head over there for an awesome burger. Their fries are to die for and the drinks are always great (they did take away the gin and cucumber juice cocktail though).  The vibe is great, the service is great, and the whole place is a great place to be on any day during the week."}
{"text":"The good: great atmosphere, great food and drinks, not to mention brunch on weekends with bottomless mimosas for $12, and a Bloody Mary bar for those needing to nurse their hangover.   The bad: while sitting at a table allows for you to make eye contact with the people you're having a convo with, the service will be terrible. Sitting at the bar is your best bet. I don't know if the servers are inexperienced or get overwhelmed with high volume times, but you will be ignored. NOT so bottomless mimosas, I saw the bottom of my glass more than I saw a drink in it.... Tolerable, in my opinion, seeing as I always return to give it another shot."}
{"text":"Updating my previous review: spoke to the manager after my last post and he went above and beyond to rectify my experience.  Increasing my review of DLUX because great customer service is appreciated."}
{"text":"This is the best burger place in Madison!  The price for everything is perfect and the milkshakes are to die for.  The first time I went I ordered a chicken sandwich fries and a chocolate peanut butter pretzel shake. The sandwich was juicy, tender and so flavorful.  (The name escapes me and I have a feeling the menu has changed since the first time I went)  The second time I went was even better. I had the couch potato burger with bacon and blue cheese fries and a red velvet shake. If you want to know what heaven tastes like just go to Dlux and order anything, I know you wont be disappointed."}
{"text":"A friend recommended this place for brunch while I was visiting Madison. The bloody mary bar was pretty cool with plenty of toppings. The breakfast sandwiches seemed to lack flavor. Overall, I was disappointed with the sandwiches and expected better.  However, I would come back for the bloody mary bar :)"}
{"text":"DLUX=Awesome.  If you want a tasty, well put together burger at a reasonable price in a really cool restaurant, you should probably go to DLUX.  I've been there twice now (but to be fair, I've only had one burger) and experiences were awesome.   The decor is very cool and trendy without being overbearing.  The booths and seats at the bar are both very comfy which is always a nice perk.  The staff here are VERY friendly and oh so helpful.  The first time we had a fantastic waitress who was attentive, perky, and gave us helpful tips.  The second time we took seats at the bar because it was a bit busier and every single person working behind the bar checked on us at least once.  The cheese curds here are definitely worth it.  The sauce is a little underwhelming which is unfortunate but they are currently sitting at number 4 on my list which is nothing to sneer at.  I've also had the jalepeno poppers which were on special that night and not on the regular menu, but they were delicious.  And they came with a berry dipping sauce which is the only way jalepeno poppers should be eaten in my opinion.   I have had the DLUX burger (comes with blue cheese, arugala, and port wine onions) and it was super tasty.  Well balanced in flavor and composition, and interestingly enough the buns that DLUX uses are really good.  Would definitely recommend.  I would also HIGHLY recommend the Chocolate Peanut Butter Pretzel Shake which is all sorts of foodgasmic and I've already had it twice.  They have other interesting shakes like Coconut Vanilla and Toasted Marshmallow, but I tend to get chocolate regret when I order sweet things so I haven't yet ventured towards those.  Pro tip, you can add booze to the shake, it's highly encouraged!  Other things to note about DLUX, they don't cook the burgers to your doneness desires, it's strictly fully cooked but they aren't dry so good on them for that.  It does keep the kitchen more expedited though and that combined with a small menu makes for a short wait time on food.  Also sides at DLUX are a la carte, so your burger will not automatically come with fries.  Which is kind of nice if you aren't the fry type (I'm sure those people exist, I just don't want to be friends with them) or aren't feeling them that particular day.    All in all, I love DLUX.  When I'm craving a good burger and milkshake, this is where I want to go.  The staff, the atmosphere, the food, the cheesecurds, and that marvelous marvelous shake will keep me coming back again and again."}
{"text":"Love it!! Great food, great location, great interior, modern atmosphere. The food was great and tasty!! Great service. I actually ate here at least 10 times before giving it a review. I got nothing but positive things to say!"}
{"text":"Worst service I have ever experienced. We were told it would be a 30-40 minute wait & ended up waiting over two hours. After 50 minutes we asked how much longer it would be so we could just go elsewhere & were told 10 minutes. 40 minutes after that we were still waiting. Stay far far away from this place if you don't want your entire Sunday afternoon wasted."}
{"text":"Sweet potato and cheese fries were amazing... I am waiting to have a burger with my husband but the fish/shrimp sandwich was pretty good. Both friends I was with didn't care for the sauce on their burgers so I recommend getting it on the side... The marshmallow shake was superb! I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"I was super hyped to try this place out, and I hate to say it, but I was really disappointed by it. I even think 3 stars is generous... I liked the décor and the ambiance. It's smaller than I thought, but was cozy and friendly. They really should change the blown out bulbs in the lighting in the squares on the back wall though.  I went on a Monday night for the $5 burgers, and I'm glad I did. If I paid full price for the burger I would definitely never go back. I ordered a burger, and it was just ok. It was a ground beef patty with toppings. Nothing special, it did not stand out at all, and the fries were also just ok. The service was also just ok, at times I actually felt like I was bothering her by just being there. Paying just $8 for a burger and fries is the reason they get 3 stars, instead of 2.  Sorry DLUX, I probably won't be back."}
{"text":"I realize I'm going against the grain here, but I was not impressed with my first (and last) DLUX experience.   I was told by a friend from work to go there, and when my brother was in town on business, I suggested meeting up there on a weekday after work.  Cool location off the square, trendy decor, great menu with a good selection beers and burgers (but no onion rings? Really??), and had a cool waiter.  All set for what should be a great burger, right?  Meh....  I had ordered a special of the week, which was a Cuban burger.  I was looking forward to a big juicy, cheesy burger with a little spice and great condiments, however, what I got was a small, dry sandwich.  The bun seemed like it was dried out, and was not toasted or grilled or buttered or anything.  The patty seemed like it came out of a freezer package.  The only silver lining was the fries that we shared which were delicious.     I told my friend about my experience and he was shocked. I really am hoping that it was just an anomaly. I think I must try their brunch soon and jump back on the bandwagon. I'm a sucker for Bloody's!"}
{"text":"Food: Awesome! My favorite burger is the farmhouse, I love all the fries but if I had to choose, the sweet potato fries w/siracha mayo and the bleu cheese and bacon fries would be the 2. The brunch isn't too bad, my favorite thing to get for brunch ate the bottomless mimosas and the donuts w/ the strawberry dip--great balance of warm and refreshing. I'm not much of a milkshake person, but they are truly great, my favorite I had was their espresso shake (with some booze too!)  Service: I always get good service here. You can tell who is new and who isn't with the speed of service but that wouldn't deter me from future visits. I love that they have a pick up option. I got my boyfriend hooked on their sweet potatoe fries and their burgers.  Tonight they had a private party so they weren't open to the public but they were willing to let us order food for pick up (at 10pm) after we got off work. When we got there the host informed us that our order got lost and they left us a voicemail to try to get our order again but we didn't even check as we were rushing from work to DLUX to get our food. They were closing up from the private party but offered to take our order, we would just have to wait for 10-15 minutes. We took up on that offer as we love their food and didn't really have any other dinner plans. On top of that they took care of a small part of our order for the inconvience. Later on the manager came out and spoke to my boyfriend, he apologize and explained to us what they tried to do, and he thanked us as well.  We honestly both didn't expect much because they have taken care of our order right away, but we greatly appreciate their urgency and service. I think the only thing my boyfriend wish they did differently was to continue to have the Mac Daddy burger.   Keep up the great work!!"}
{"text":"I've had very few bad burgers in Wisconsin (they must really just know how to handle their meat here) and DLUX is another just very solid place to grab a burger in Madison. The atmosphere is sleek and open and usually pretty popping and yet is never too loud that you're not able to converse with your table mates. The DLUX Standard burger is a very good, as the name implies, standard burger with regular fixings, but my favorite is probably the mushroom swiss because I'm a total sucker for mushroom burgers. The fries are good and crispy and they have a good lunch deal where you can add fries for just a dollar more.   They also have a good drink special after 10pm - buy one get one free cocktails, tap beers, and wines. The Juni-Pear and Southern Charm are particularly delicious. They also serve food late so if after a couple drinks you get a hankering for a burger and fries, you're covered."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and I love it. I've only had the chicken burgers as the entree, but man what burgers they are. I love the Margherita chicken and is by far my favorite. It's fresh and savory at the same time. I've also had the Spicy Hawaiian chicken. I absolutely love the fries. Parmesan truffle fries are my favorite, but the cheddar green onion is good too. The bottomless mimosas are definitely a go-to if you're having brunch and they go down easy.  I haven't had a chance to try the shakes but I hear good things. I definitely will continue to eat here."}
{"text":"I had high expectations and really wanted it to be a good place to go as I love the idea of the place, we were out on a Friday celebrating a friends birthday.  Positive: The creativity of what the burgers had on them and quality of those toppings are great as well as the variety of ways you can get french fries (garlic truffle were the best we tried).  The decor is nice and it is in a good part of town.  Service was great as well so it has a lot going for it.    The problem started with their kegged cocktails, 3 out of 4 of them tasted extremely tart and overly sugared to the point where you couldn't tell what was really in them (the margarita was good)  The other major problem was the quality of the beef patty, much like the other reviews the patty was bland and overcooked.  2 out of the 6 at our table had what they thought a patty that was cooked to where it wasn't overly dry, the rest of us felt it was dry and flavorless.    My advice is this place just needs to improve the quality of their meat, the kegged cocktails is just a matter of taste, but the flavorless dry beef patties is a big deal, nobody wants to spend $10 on a burger that relies completely on the bun and toppings."}
{"text":"Nice place for upscale burgers fries and shakes! The burgers were good and they had a nice selection of specialty shakes to try, we had the Caramel salted pecan and Red velvet. We will be back to sample more ! The Bacon blue cheese fries that we ordered as a small for a appetizer were so good we ordered another ! Pleasant service and staff."}
{"text":"Went here for brunch on Saturday morning around 11am. We sat at the bar-like seating at the window, and had pretty excellent service.   The MAJOR highlight for me was the DIY Stoli Bloody Mary bar. Here's the low-down:   -$8, which sounds pricey, but... -You can choose between plain and jalapeno vodka, and then you go up to the bar and create your own!  -There are two mixes: plain tomato/veggie juice and doctored-up garlicky tastiness. ---There's also plenty of Worcester, Siracha, Tobasco, etc. sauces (plus horseradish, a pepper mill, etc. etc.) in case it's not EXACTLY as you want it.  -Then come the garnishes, which could make an entire meal in and of themselves. To give you an idea of the selection, here's what i can remember: bacon, cheese-stuff olives, pimento-stuffed olives, pickles, asparagus, two kinds of cheese, pepperoni, a meat stick, cucumber, sweet red pepper...um, yeah. It's intense.   The other highlight of our meal were the doughnut balls. Oh. My. Science. These were incredible. Served hot, covered in powdered sugar, and with a side of raspberry-yogurt dipping sauce...and only $5 for 8 of these, which are basically about two bites each.   The reason for 4 stars and not 5? I got a breakfast sandwich with a portabella mushroom, fried egg, and I believe some kind of sauce...and it's was just kinda meh. Not terrible, but I was expecting it to pack a lot more flavor. The side of potatoes was a lot more exciting."}
{"text":"To be honest and fair, this review is only for brunch. I haven't been here otherwise. I am a huge proponent of the bottomless mimosa brunches, when they are done correctly. DLUX brings it. Their food is tasty and on point. They have a wide selection that can cater towards the big eaters and vegetarians alike. The mimosas are kept full and cold. Awesome job.  Why not 5 stars? Too small... too crowded... no RSVPs... they let too many people come in and drink. This place gets more packed than KK."}
{"text":"I gave dlux a five star because we had a great lunch experience here today. Nothing bad to say. I had two june-pear drinks and my boyfriend had the bloody Mary. My boyfriend had already been here, so he wanted to order the fried pickles and cheese curds. The bloody was good, \"not a generic bloody Mary\", he said. My drink was extremely sweet... which I love. My second drink was much stronger than my first though. The apps were both great. You will enjoy the fried pickles even if you are not a big pickle fan. Their burgers do not come with fries, so appetizers are something you may want to consider. My boyfriend ordered the steakhouse burger. He really enjoyed it, but it was too rich to finish. I got the spicy chicken Hawaii burger. This burger came with chicken patty, bacon, pineapple, spicy mayo and jalapenos. I had them hold the jalapeno and I'm embarrassed to admit that I added ketchup. It was really great, and a nice alternative to a beef burger. I would still suggest it."}
{"text":"Best Burger Place in Town!  Came here with a friend for lunch and it was excellent! The atmosphere makes you feel upscale in a casual setting, service was superb and the food delicious! I love that you can swap out the burger for a chicken burger or Portobello mushroom for free. The Parmesan & truffle cream fries are a MUST! Or any of their fries for that matter! DLUX is also a member of the food fight restaurant club which is great! I don't go out for lunch very often during work but will be coming back here soon it was so good!"}
{"text":"One of the key things that can make or break a business for me is how the management team responds to customer feedback. All too often they discount it or seem to ignore it altogether - I can certainly say, in this area, DLUX has got them beat, hands down.  After typing a lukewarm comment or two about the mediocre service I received at DLUX I received an immediate (perhaps it was 45 seconds, but no more than that) message from one of the owners, empathizing with the situation, asking for more info, and very kindly inviting us back for another round.  It was impressive... so how could we resist heading back??  Round two was great.  A lively, modern space, DLUX impresses when it comes to ambiance.  The place has had a wee bit of a wait on both of the weeknights we've been there, which is not surprising given that the place is not as big as it appears from the outside.  Love the decor and lighting, it pulses with urban energy.  Purse hooks tucked under the bar are always a nice touch, as is validated parking at one of the nearby ramps (be sure to refer to the website to make sure you park in the right one!) The large 4-sided bar is the centerpiece of the restaurant, literally, and semi-circle booths and small rectangular tables line three of the walls, leaving a small front area open for a happy hour crowd standing and mingling.  Patio tables out front offer an urban dining experience, which I definitely enjoy.  We had Lola B. Dog with us and the DLUX staff graciously accommodated her on the patio, even offering water.   The menu is primarily burgers, with a few salads (all of which included meat, although you can ask for it without and they'll also knock $2 off the price if you do that, so that's appreciated) Plenty of vegetarian options with the burgers, as they allow a free substitution to a portabella on any of their tasty concoctions. There is also a Portabella Caprese burger on the menu along with a White Bean burger, which was excellent.  We also tried the special of the day, which was a falafal burger - it was quite good, but be warned, on the spicy side!  The size of the burgers were good for me, but probably a tad small for a strapping lad who may want to opt for the upgrade to a double (+$3). No sides come with these burgers (all $8) so if you want fries with that plan on +$2.  I'm fine with that, I don't need/want a pound of fries with my dinner anyways!  Service was good on our recent visit and the hostess was charming, even double-checking with her manager that we could have the dog on the patio (which we could as long as she didn't get under foot, of course).  The interest in customer service management takes is what trickles down to the staff and in this case DLUX seems to be off to a good start.  A nice lively, modern, urban addition to downtown."}
{"text":"High class burgers and high class atmosphere! Very cool vibe.  Will be more expensive than most places, so if your're a cheap-o, just stick with culvers take out.  If you can afford class, you will love this place.  Oh - and the shakes are delicious!"}
{"text":"I was really happy when I ordered carry out from DLUX today and it came in a paper bag and fully paper takeaway containers. A few restaurants in Madison use wax coated paper takeaway containers, but as I understand the all paper containers that DLUX uses are better for the environment. I will definitely be ordering carry out from them again (and again). Thank you DLUX!"}
{"text":"Grateful for friends who suggested DLUX for our 13 year olds birthday dinner.  We look for new places and I was honestly a bit reticent that 'burgers and shakes' might be too mundane to welcome the start of teen years.  Yet from the moment we arrived DLUX felt fun and big city, \"ooh, that looks cool\" - staff was very friendly and welcoming to family in mix of corporate and casual city diners. Bar was packed creating fun feel and tables were well spaced allowing for the odd 5th chair to fit in nicely. Free shake for birthday girl was nice touch as is free parking.   Drinks - good - though fancy sodas are tough to judge and not just for kids (will the ginger strawberry be too spicy, is the grapefruit lime to sour - yes!). A NOTE TO ALL RESTAURANTS - your eaters are better at judging taste profiles than ingredients, help us by giving a sense of taste not assume we know based on ingredients.. One shake (red velvet) was loved by all , the other (lemon chiffon?) too over powering to be consumed even by the table. Still fun to try.   Food - meat burgers loved by all meat eaters, salmon a little too much garlic in sauce, white fish / shrimp odd texture but tasted good. Fries 'perfect' but a little tough. Chimichurri  salad - yummy - needs more seeds, but sharing with table of meat eaters who LOVED the flank steak, really LOVED it - so much flavor.   Agree with others that \"general swank\" and \"keeping it cahz\" is trying too hard, no reservations is fine, but so is responding to email requests to check in for big night.   Definitely worth a try!"}
{"text":"Been here twice and have enjoyed both times! The atmosphere is pretty nice, though a little dark. Service is quicker than you think it would be, which was a bonus.   I ordered the Mushroom burger the first time I went, along with the cheese curds. The burger was alright, though I'd go for something a little bit more daring on the menu. It was a little bit blander than I thought it was going to be.   The cheese curds are delicious! They're unlike most cheese curds around Madison in the sense that they have more of a cheddar taste. Also, they bread them with something that tastes like a delicious garlic biscuit (think: gourmet Red Lobster biscuits filled with cheese).   The second time I went I got the Spicy Hawaiian Chicken sorta-burger. It was really delicious. I was worried about the meat being dry, but it was perfect.   My last comment is for the shakes they have. They all look delicious, but both times I went I ordered the chocolate peanut butter pretzel shake. So delicious! Not the thickest milkshake ever, but still really yummy. They're sort of large so I suggest splitting with someone else for the perfect sized dessert!"}
{"text":"Burgers - hits and misses BUT the hits were AWESOME.  If you ever need a reason to come to DLUX? It has the BEST milkshakes in town. Get the SALTED CARAMEL shake. *drools* it's my favorite.  To maximize your experience in DLUX, if you have a smaller stomach like me and my boyfriend, share the fries, burger and a shake. You get the whole experience, but you won't be too full to leave ;)  Favorites so far: sweet potato fries, mushroom swiss burger and SALTED CARAMEL shake ;)  Oh, and it's big and spacious, love the booths!!"}
{"text":"I've only been here for drinks, but i had a good time. I'm often weary of dimly lit establishments  like this since I'm not much of a \"nightlife dude,\" and there's nothing worse than a place with pulsing house music where I can't hear what others are saying. But this wasn't like that at all, and it felt very mellow, actually. Can't say more cause I didn't eat any food."}
{"text":"I've never been disappointed by a shake before.  I have no idea what was wrong with my blackberry shake; maybe it was the fact that it wasn't cold (it was just 'cool')..  The burger were very, very tasty.  Yeah, it's not the typical Madison fare, but a different burger (esp. ones like the pimento cheeseburger) makes for a great entree.  Their sweet potato fries are thick-cut and definitely worth getting.  The ultra-modern decor (gray) and service (curt) kinda adds to the vibe that this place caters to the passers-by and isn't interested in making any friends.  It was incredibly hard to pin the crowd that would frequent this place; while we were in for weekend lunch, there was a church group, casual bipsters (yolo), and young families.  All in all, grab a table if you're in the area.  I dunno if I'd make it a destination."}
{"text":"Delicious! Bloody Mary bar awesome. Way too loud and pretty trendy. Bring ear plugs if you are over 30."}
{"text":"Can't go wrong with a visit to DLUX. This is my fourth time here and I've left happy and full each time! Tonight's visit was a Father's Day celebration - he wanted a burger and a beer, so downtown we came! It's a great atmosphere - TVs if you want to catch a little sports, fun artwork on the walls, and bar and table seating alike.  We ordered the buffalo chicken nachos to start and they were fantastic. Even if you wouldn't normally get a buffalo chicken style dish, I recommend - I don't believe you'll be disappointed. They cover pub chips with a great flavored cheese sauce, green onions, fresh tomatoes, blue cheese and shredded chicken covered in a hot sauce - perfect amount of heat for me (normally sticking with the mild option).  I tried the Sugar Mama cocktail and loved it - grapefruit not too overpowering and the hint of St. Germain was awesome.  I'll admit I don't branch away from the Standard burger because....well, why? It's perfect. I've tried most of the fries and they are probably my least favorite part of the menu - after sampling those pub chips I'll get those next time if I need a side, or maybe that Asian slaw I was left wishing I hard ordered! My vegetarian daughter said \"best I've ever had\" regarding the white bean patty she subbed in for the standard."}
{"text":"Ohmygod I ate so much food.  Fried pickles.  French fries with all kinds of toppings.  A SALTED CARAMEL MILKSHAKE.  Burgers galore (pressed, no temp taken).  Great salads.  Reasonable prices.  Friendly faces.  Just writing this review makes me want another milkshake."}
{"text":"This place does some thing very well, but others just ok.  Their burgers are creative and overall pretty darn tasty.  Don't expect a gigantic 1/2 pound monstrosity.  The burgers are well portioned and made with care.  The sweet potato fires are an absolute highlight.  Get them...now!  The shakes are also fairly well done and with the added bonus of the option to make them adult.  They will make any shake boozy.  All you have to do is ask.   Their brunch is not bad either.  The menu is not extensive, but they do have a make your own bloody marry bar for $8 and $10 bottomless mimosas from 10AM-3PM.  Unfortunately my wife did have a very dry and not very flavorful turkey sausage breakfast sandwich.  I will overlook this as the breakfast potatoes were excellent with the sriracha aioli.  The service however was merely adequate.  They never seemed to care if or when food or drinks arrived and never made any objective effort to notice if you needed anything unless flagged down multiple times.   Overall, this place is still growing into its own.  I imagine it will only get better as it figures out what it wants to be (hip, retro, mod?).  DLUX is solid if all you want is a good upscale burger and a decent drink."}
{"text":"Ok guys. Don't mess around - Just get the boozy (Bailey's) espresso milkshake. It's the best thing you'll ever have. Ever.  We had brunch around 9:30 this morning - I had the Eggs Benedict with a side of the parmesan / truffle breakfast potatoes. The eggs benny could have used a little more flavor, but were overall tasty. The breakfast potatoes were COVERED in parm and truffle cream and were basically heaven.   My boyfriend got the chicken fried chicken breakfast sandwich - His personal review, in his own words: \"I'd give it a 4/5 stars; the egg was a little over cooked. They just plopped it on a plate - Not a great presentation.\" (It's hard to get 5 stars outta him.)  Love coming here for the bottomless mimosas, too. FYI: There's a 2-hour table limit from the time they pour your first mimosa."}
{"text":"Went here last night with my boyfriend and was not disappointed. It's a pretty small space so expect to wait a little while even if you go there on a week night. The bar is great and drinks are reasonably priced. We didn't get an appetizer but we both had burgers that were very good. He had the classic burger and I had the pimento cheese burger. The pepper jam is to die for! Both of our burgers were a little bit more well done than we would have liked (we like ours medium rare, a little more towards rare), but still good. I am gluten free and was very impressed with their gluten free menu...it's pretty extensive! And they offer gluten free buns which is great and definitely not something you get everywhere. The fries were decent, but as my boyfriend pointed out tasted like something you can buy at the grocery store and make yourself. Didn't get to try a milkshake as we were so full but next time that will definitely be the first thing I order!"}
{"text":"Not the absolutely best burger but a fun selection of styles. Atmosphere is collegiate chic, which is to say, cool enough but full of kids. It also looks shockingly like Ocean's Grill which is weird to me because if I opened a new joint I would be all about redecorating.  Milkshakes are a delightful menu option.  Sweet potato fries with spicy mayo dip? Yes please and thank you.  Would do again in hopes that I'd be tempted to go for another start. I think this place is upwardly mobile."}
{"text":"DLUX is a fun atmosphere. It is a typically delicious dining experience. Hence why I keep returning. Dates, duh! Friends and family, for sure! Co-workers, completely!   There are a lot of delicious burger options, so I won't go too far into descriptions other than my favorite. The Farmhouse. That tomato jam is everything and more. I always ask for extra tomato jam and extra sriracha aioli for my burger and fries. So you probably want to look away when I'm eating here. It's a little obscene and I'm not apologetic in the least!  The other burger must-have depends on the special. My most recent visit kicked the Farmhouse out to pasture! It was either a pulled-pork or short rib, mushroom, swiss divinity from the burger heavens! I thank the burger divinities for sharing with us peasants.   Vegetarian burger options have been decently done as well but I'm quite a veggie burger diva, and it's been a long time since I tried one at DLUX.  Milkshakes are also extravagant, but presentation can be a little sloppy, depending on who makes them and how busy the place is at the time. I don't indulge in milkshakes at DLUX much due to the fact that I am stuffing my tummy and expanding my waistline on fries and burgers. My guests always go cuckoo when they order them, though!  I have noticed that lunch anytime and Thursday/Friday/Saturday evenings can be busy or crowded.  It is unfortunate that I have yet to experience brunch at DLUX. If you have, message me and let me know how it is please! :)"}
{"text":"Wife got the Velvet Shake, which was good. The fried pickles were great.   But our entrees were just o-kay sadly. Her burger was alright and my salmon burger was alright as well. Nothing terrible, but is it worth going downtown and waiting for? I'd have to say no."}
{"text":"What impressed me about the burgers here was the balance of ingredients. I got the signature DLUX burger, and found that no single ingredient overpowered another (even with a strong blue cheese dressing).  With other burgers you often get too much bun, or too much meat, etc; here, everything was evenly proportioned. My wife had the same thing to say about the whitefish/shrimp sandwich, a surprising delight that I will have to order for myself next time.    Okay, I concur I would rather have my burger a little rarer. But while the locally-farmed quality meat is a strong selling point, it's really the mix of all fresh ingredients (like nicely mixed arugula greens) that is the focus here. The sharp cheddar/green onion fries were also delicious, though rather soggy. I would encourage the cooks to make sure the potatoes are good and crispy before dousing them with fixin's.  Didn't get to the milkshakes, will have to try those at our next visit.  The vibe is urban cool, though more \"family-friendly\" than I expected. Bar is nice and large, and dominates the space . . . we will likely just perch ourselves there next time and continue to sample this compelling burger menu."}
{"text":"Always delicious. Burgers that aren't just burgers, milkshakes, brunch, mimosas,bloody bar, and amazing fries... we love DLUX"}
{"text":"Overall way too much for too little.  I will say the burgers and fries tasted great.  The service was slow, very slow.  One of our burgers was missing a key ingredient when we asked about it the server came back and said oh it was just sitting back there and gave it to us to add to the partially eaten burger.  No sorry we forgot half your sandwich, just here you go.    Great possibilities underwhelming execution.  The ingredients were fresh and well put together, but small.  A $9 burger and $3 fries should not be the size of a Culver's snack pack.    I'd say too much glam not enough substance.  The good.  My burger was well cooked medium rare (even though they didn't ask how I would like it).  The guacamole was excellent, mild without much salsa or garlic, but good given the fact it was on a burger.  Just realized they forgot the tortilla chips that were supposed to be on my burger.  Anyway, the onions were fresh and the bun was soft and buttery.  My wife's was pretty plain even when they brought out the rest of the ingredients.  The blue cheese and bacon fries were great, good blue cheese and sauce and the fries were pretty good.  The sweet potatoes fries were better, but lacking in sauce and seasoning."}
{"text":"If you want a burger or an awesome mimosa, head to Dlux. Brunch here has become a staple for yuppies everywhere. Pimiento cheeseburger, sweet potato fries, and bottomless mimosas and you're good to go."}
{"text":"Wow the cheese curds are so good and the walnut black bean burger is great. The.fries.are.good.but ask for the cheese sause on the side if not its a bit too cheese"}
{"text":"I've been here twice now, once for a late dinner and once for a business lunch. Dinner was very crowded, but service was fast. We were in a booth that didn't really sit the number we had in our party, so if you have a larger group try to snag a table! We were lucky to get there early for lunch and snagged a booth, much more comfortable for two people, but service was very slow. They did offer to comp a milkshake to enjoy during the wait, but as my friend had already ordered one we did not take advantage.   For dinner I had a southwest salad which was delicious! I looked forward to ordering it again for lunch, but found they had redone their menu and it was no longer available. For lunch I ordered the spicy Hawaiian \"sorta burger.\" The chicken burger included a slab of pineapple, not just a round which was a nice touch - pineapple all the way through - but the sandwich as a whole was a little too wet and the chicken wasn't very flavorful. The only spice I really got was when biting into a jalapeño, even though there was spicy aioli and pepper jack cheese as well, it didn't really add up to \"spicy\" all the way through.   We also shared an order of the Parmesan truffle fries. The fries had obviously been sitting around while our food cooked. The truffle cream made them soggy and they were almost room temperature. Pretty disappointing. This restaurant may have earned four stars if the fries had come out earlier than our food when the kitchen was backed up, rather than being offered a free milkshake.   I really want to like this place. The atmosphere is cool and the food is very fresh, but I just haven't experienced the right combination of service and taste yet."}
{"text":"Pretty trendy place with attentive, young, friendly staff (at least on this Saturday morning!)  The \"Bottomless Mimosa\" deal (2 hours of unlimited refills for $12) with a group of friends and  downtown Madison readily available for wandering/wobbling afterward made for QUITE a good day."}
{"text":"What happened????  My beloved deluxe has become de-yucks!  I have been going to deluxe regularly since it opened. The burgers WERE big, juicy and delicious. Now they are as thin as McDonalds, skimpy on the toppings and is dry as the Sahara desert.    The drinks were weak and I couldn't taste any alcohol. Usually they were decent but now pack NO punch. What a waste of money!  Finally the service-  they were moderately busy and it took almost a half hour to get our drinks and an hour to get our food!  The waitresses blamed it on the challenge of making a Bloody Mary... Seriously???  You are a bar/restaurant, I've bartend, it doesn't take more than a few minutes, even with a lot of garnish.   Deluxe- please get your shit together and go back to the food and service of past!  Sooooo disappointed!!!  For now we are officially breaking up. Don't call me, I'll call you.  ***Update-  we went back, the service was improved and the food was better this time but still not as good as the early days when it first opened."}
{"text":"It pains me to down grade this place as I really liked it! I recently dined at DLUX for dinner. I usually always get the couch potato burger (maybe that was my mistake) I decided to try their DLUX burger, it was 'meh' I was regretting my choice. Myself and 2 guests I was with got the parmesan truffle cream fries which is a fav - they came out cold! booo.  I also ordered their lemongrass lemonade (one of their house made sodas) it had no taste at all! It tasted like I was just drinking club soda. Very disappointing dinner - really hoping it was just an \"off\" night for them."}
{"text":"Had the mushroom and Swiss chicken burger! Probably the best chicken burger I've ever had.  Blue cheese fries. .. Pretty good too."}
{"text":"I've always liked DLUX. The atmosphere for a square box is amazingly fun! It helps having a bar in the middle of the room to break things up. The burgers, and all the 'sorta burgers' I've had here have been excellent....and they are all the same price! They do rotate the menu regularly, which is great in some repects but disappointing when your fav disappears.... like the California Chicken Buger with avacado. (Hear me DLUX?!) The cheese curds are good, the fried pickles are too, but THE best side is the Parmesan and Truffle Cream Fries. It packs a punch but have a 'Shot in the Dark' cocktail.  Reminiscent of Heritage Tavern's 'Malört and Stormy', it's a great kick-ass drink! Be sure to order one of the 'to die for' shakes for dessert. The 'Salted Carmel Pecan?.....as I said...TDF! Enjoy!"}
{"text":"We came here for dinner after my wedding. I had never been before but picked it based on proximity and that it seemed like it was reasonably priced but not fast food. There were kids with us so I also wanted something they would like too. This place was awesome! The burgers and sides were amazing and the service was great"}
{"text":"This place has a cool atmosphere. A big bar i the middle of the restaurant, and tables around it in a square shape. I liked it a lot!  I believe they are known for their burgers here, fries also come separate. Burgers are around $9 and fries $3.25/$6.50 spending on the size.  I got the porkys revenge and Parmesan and truffle cream fries. Both were really good! I liked the porkys a lot because it had really tasty crispy pork belly. The fries also had a lot of flavors.  Oh yeah, the milkshakes are pretty bomb, you have the option to add alcohol to it. I had the chocolate peanut butter pretzel and it tasted exactly like it sounds.  Nothing too fancy but a good spot to come if you're craving better than average American classics!"}
{"text":"Great environment good burgers and drinks. Everyone likes the weekend bottomless mimosas. This is a little known gem."}
{"text":"I had dinner on a busy Saturday evening with my husband.  I got the salmon-burger and the sweet potato fries.  It was good, but it didn't blow me away.  The service was excellent, but  I would like the atmosphere better if the music wasn't blaring.  Sometimes I think restaurants try too hard to be hip.  I'd go back, but I'd try something different."}
{"text":"The other reviews confuse me.   1) The burger patties are way too thin, ordering an extra patty is a must.   2) a burger place that can't deliver a burger cooked to the level of doneness you ask for has a problem. Ordering medium rare and instead getting a tough puck that is cooked to well done is a burger place that has a problem. With an extra patty on each burger and three people at the table, that's six chances to cook a patty right and all 6 were over cooked by a lot.   3) the toppings were flavorless. I had the farmhouse which was completely boring. One companion had the Dlux, which was also boring. Another companion had the Backyard BBQ, and that was ok minus the way overcooked and tough patty.  I'd recommend skipping this place and going to Dotty's, Alchemy, or Vintage."}
{"text":"This place is right off the square by the Capitol. The ambiance is real intimate. It is mainly a burger place and they have quite a selection.   My wife ordered their DLux burger. I tried their mushroom Swiss burger. Both burgers were tender and well put together. The flavors were mild and I could have used some more spice, salt, or something to get some more flavor out of it.   My friends ordered the Peanut Butter Jelly burger (burger of the week?) and their Carolina BBQ burger. The PB&J is not for anyone who doesn't LOVE peanut butter. The BBQ burger looked the best and will be the burger for me to try next time.   The place also has delicious milkshakes made from Sassy Cow ice cream. The flavor of the month is the peppermint shake. This was the highlight of the meal!  Overall, this is a great burger place for a fine dining establishment! I will be returning."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely delicious. They have some amazing burgers: DLUX, Backyard BBQ (probably my personal favorite), Carnegie, Mushroom and Swiss Melt, etc... Each burger is bursting with so much flavor you'll want to order one of their special house cocktails to wash it down.   I've had their Shot in the Dark, which is a delectable combination of rum, their house spicy ginger beer and lime juice. Be warned, this drink may taste delicious, but it's quite strong.  if you're into something more sweet, I'd suggest their house margarita. It's not too strong, but also not too fruity, which is just the way I like it.  Finally, if you're into the fruity stuff, get their Cherry Bounce Collins, which tastes like a Shirley Temple infused with a little bit of liquor.  Oh and I didn't even mention their desserts yet. They have toasted marshmallow milkshakes with rumchata, pina colada Malibu milkshakes and a plethora of other alcoholic flavored milkshakes. Now don't worry, you won't even taste the alcohol because it's so faint.  And to tie everything up, their service was fantastic. The waitresses (not sure if there were waiters there, meh) were extremely nice and friendly. They were super accommodating and weren't afraid to strike a conversation with just about anyone.  Anyways, I am out of good things to say about this place, so I think I will stop there."}
{"text":"This place has a great atmosphere and bar for happy hour. One notable drink my dinner mates and I all enjoyed was the Shot in the Dark-- it was fragrant, funky fresh.  The food was affordable and average. Service was variable--at times speedy and then very slow, even with a sparse crowd. But the winner here is the bar."}
{"text":"I came here for brunch with a girlfriend after hearing good things about the bloody marys and mimosas. I ordered a mushroom egg breakfast sandwich and the diy bloody mary, and she had the turkey sausage breakfast sandwich with bottomless mimosas.  To start with the breakfast cocktails, my friend seemed to really enjoy the mimosas - she took three refills. Really sweet drinks are not my thing, but the sip I had was pleasant enough.   I had high expectations for the bloody mary bar, but was underwhelmed. While the ingredients and add-ons are ubiquitous, the cheese had obviously been sitting out all morning and seemed stale and glossy. The bacon was the \"ready-to-eat\" variety that I ended up leaving on my plate (it seemed like a cute novel idea at the bar, but less appetizing once I sat down and actually took a closer look at it). The vegetables were a day or so from going soft, which did not bode well for the skewers available. No one wants grape tomatoes spraying all over their white top, and no one wants browning, soft celery. The bloody mary mix itself was nice - I got the spicy mix and added a little of the plain tomato juice. The vodka they provide you with has obviously been watered down - they are cutting corners and it shows.  Moving on to the food - my friend ate her whole sandwich and thought it was delicious. I on the other hand, picked away at a quarter of mine before giving up. The bun just isn't suited for an egg-only sandwich, there needs to be more substance, even if you're rounding it out with bacon or sausage There is a reason the most breakfast sandwiches are english muffins or toasts (and some substantial croissants): they are sturdy enough to balance out the more delicate texture of eggs, vegetables, and breakfast meats. A burger bun is meant for a quarter pound of beef; it is light and fluffy to contrast the heaviness of the rest of the sandwich. The bun might have been salvageable if it was toasted, but it was a dry bun with an egg, mushroom, and some cheese slapped on.  The atmosphere and staff are good. The restaurant has comfortable booths, and plenty of chairs around the bar, which is well stocked. You can have a group that enjoys Bud Light or more unique cocktails and probably please everyone. Our waiter was helpful, explaining DLUX's concept and answering all the questions we had about the food without hovering too much.  So there are two views here, hence the three star rating. My friend LOVED everything about DLUX and can't wait to go back for their happy hour. I probably wouldn't go back unless that was what everyone was set on, and I'd think twice about cocktails if they are as watered down as my bloody mary was."}
{"text":"Hands-down the most mouthwatering Bloody Mary bar in town. I am salivating just  picturing it to accurately describe its glory. After you pick your poison - regular or spicy jalapeno vodka - the real fun begins. You can use their Dlux fully-loaded mix or concoct your own elixir to tickle your fancy. Try to remember not to be gluttonous (yet) because this is one of those rare times in life when you'll prefer your glass not filled to the brim with liquid. The small fixins' buffet you're about to embark on warrants its own empty glass...or casserole dish. They've got the usuals - pickles, olives, appropriate citrus wedges, etc. but the magic is in the little extras: pickled veggies, raw veggies, Wisconsin cheese cubes, perfectly sized sausages, miniature surf n turf, tiramisu, tears from a virgin, and last, but certainly not least, an epic heaping pile of greasy bacon just patiently and valiantly waiting to be consumed with gusto.   Besides the obvious embellishments (can you spot the fibs?), and all kidding aside, this is what bars in heaven must be like. Not to mention $10 bottomless - and I mean truly without bottom - mimosas that seem to refill themselves instantaneously. Don't even get me started on the sausage breakfast sandwiches and loaded breakfast potatoes...unless...how much time do you have?"}
{"text":"This place is clearly going for an upscale, trendy vibe: Scandinavian-looking furniture and lighting, throwback pop art on the walls, clubby music playing just loud enough that you need to raise your voice a little. Interestingly, the patrons were less 'urbane hipster' as you might expect and more 'college hangover crowd'...lots of Packer/Badger apparel-clad bro-dudes talking loudly. The atmosphere was not appealing for Sunday brunch, but I toughed it out. I had a sausage breakfast sandwich with breakfast potatoes and donut balls for dessert. The food was pretty good overall, though I'm not convinced the cheese sauce on the potatoes was anything more than generic Cheez Whiz. With a soda my total was $18.44, which is about what you'd expect at this type of place, though it feels a bit high for the amount and quality of food. My server was fine. The overall experience was slightly mixed, not too bad but nothing I expect to do again any time soon, or ever really. I can say it's easily my least favorite of the several Foodfight restaurants I've experienced."}
{"text":"I've mostly avoided this place since I'm vegetarian, but I gave it a try after seeing their menu and a few meat-free options. I opted for the southwest white bean burger and was pretty impressed. The burger was a bit mushy but many veggie burgers are. Toppings included poblano peppers and crispy tortilla strips so there was a bit of texture to mix well with the burger.   I think it's a little pricey for what you get. If fries or a little salad came on the side it would be a better meal for the price."}
{"text":"I ordered delivery. The burger was still a little warm, but the sweet potato fries were cold and limp. I can't blame the restaurant for that - it was the delivery service. I enjoyed the Farmhouse Burger, if you like a big greasy burger which is what I was craving when I ordered. The bacon was super crispy - yum. I'm glad the tomato jam (more like syrup than jam) was packaged separately. I tried dipping the burger in it, and it was much too sweet for my taste. Back to those fries. I reheated them in my microwave. They were still limp but now that they were hot, they were delicious. Overall, could have been better but not bad."}
{"text":"Three stars feels a bit harsh, but I can't give give four stars... I had the DLUX burger, good combination of toppings but I didn't even realize until my food arrived that the waitress didn't ask me how I wanted my burger cooked. I always get medium rare, so it was disappointing that it was served medium (skimming the other reviews, it's sounding like this is a standard policy here). So for me, the burger was overlooked. We had two chicken sandwiches ordered at our table and I had a small sampling of them. Both were pretty good, but the \"avocado spread\" that came with one chicken sandwich was a gross dark green, barely resembling guacamole :(  I'd like to see a few more beers on tap, selection was limiting (though they did have some decent bottle selections). It would also be nice to mix up the type of bun used on the different sandwiches, that would set them apart. Overall, feels like DLUX is just a hair too expensive for what they turn out, quality isn't on par with the price.   I will say that the sweet potato fries were out of this world! Quite possibly the best I've had--crunchy on the outside but moist and tender on the inside, and the sauce served with them was a real winner. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"D lux decor is a welcome escape  from the Wisconsin Tavern scene around the square courtesy of Food Fight.  FF does an amazing job of creating spot on ambience and this has the elegance of a big city lounge.   No complaints with our waitress or the drinks. Now to the food, where FF often lacks.  The menu is hipster cool.  Sea salt fries and an order of blue cheese bacon fries, meh.  Barely warm and odd texture, not sure if that had to do with the lack of heat or not.  Here's where I diverge into two very different experiences from my companion.  He is a carnivore and loves burgers.  Ordered the Farmhouse burger, unfortunately you can not specify how you want it done.  He loved it. He thinks it is definitely  a top contender in the burger world.  My meal, same version but with the chicken patty. Which isn't a real piece of chicken breast, but an on-site grinding and reforming of high quality chicken, according to our waitress.  I would prefer a real chicken breast."}
{"text":"Terrible. worst hamburger i have ever had McDonalds muh better this is a rip off. the people that think DLUX is good are really living in a dream world"}
{"text":"I've had the vegetarian burger twice and it was fine, not good or bad.  The fries and sauces are good. The cake milkshakes are great! But really for food, I'd only go back if friends wanted to go. Maybe this is because I'm a vegetarian. I'm not sure.  The restaurant has a nice ambiance."}
{"text":"I go here because it's right around the corner from my office and well, sometimes you gotta have a burger.  But, as other reviewers have said - the burger's are production-line thin and way overdone, even if you ask for rare or medium-rare.  The sauces and toppings are super-yummy, and the place would be fab if they knew how to grill."}
{"text":"Others have described the food well so I'll just say that it was very rich but not super flavorful.  Seemed like if it was going to be that many calories it should taste better.  As for burgers, Tip Top and Weary Traveler are both better."}
{"text":"I'll update this to increase it by a star. I arrived on a Saturday afternoon and there was plenty of bar seating but no tables available so I told the hostess I would wait at the bar. I was then pleasantly served by the bartender who went through the drinks and told me about their kegged specialties which are cocktails that are kegged so they dispense them like beer. I had to try it so i got the Juni-Pear. If you are a gin fan you are going to love this. Its light, fruity and fresh and delish..its also strong. which is a great deal if you're not in the mood for their unlimited mimosas on the weekend ($12)! since i was here for lunch this time instead of breakfast I ordered their green goddess salad while my friend got the farmhouse burger. Both of these were delish. I loved the light dressing on the salad and it came in a pretty big portion. The burger... well...honestly you can't really mess up a burger with an egg in it...it was amazing. and the combination of the sweet and savory were perfect.   The cheese potatoes were just okay. I would recommend the cheese fries instead because the potatoes were a little cold when they came out. But the most important update about this review is the you MUST order the chocolate pretzel milkshake. this thing is golden, thick, sweet, delicious goodness.   Happy eating!"}
{"text":"Awesome food.  Great drinks.  Great service.  Reminds me of eating and drinking in NYC."}
{"text":"DLUX makes a fine burger...  ...and a fine shake.  ...and fine cheese / green onion fries  ...and a fine root beer float.  So much so that while working at an event at Monona Terrace the other night, I sent several hungry people over there.  All came back stuffed and happy.  The burger combos and quality are not too far off from what you'd find at a Red Robin, but with at atmosphere that feels much less like a restaurant chain kiddie fun-land and more like a yuppie hipster paradise.    But it's the fries.  Oh those fries.  I don't even think I saw a traditional order of french fries on the menu.  The fries offered include fries covered in cheese and green onions as well as an order covered in bacon and blue cheese, among other combinations.  Did I mention shakes?  Yeah, you CAN put booze in it if you like.  Because why wouldn't you?  The burger prices are pretty reasonable, but the drink prices sit on the border of high.    Overall, as the 4 stars would say \"Yay!  I'm a fan.\"  It's a unique atmosphere for a burger joint, but as I said earlier, they make a fine burger."}
{"text":"Nothing really special about this place. The burgers were good, but then again, most burgers at nice restaurants are \"good.\" The flavor combinations were so-so. I had the salmon burger, which was a pressed salmon patty with a fried green tomato on top. I could not taste the tomato at all--it was breaded in cornmeal and really blended into the flavor of the salmon patty (which had a little too much garlic). Also, we had the DLUX burger, which was good, but nothing special. The fries were also not my favorite. They were the thicker cut kind with the peel still on. I prefer thinner, peeled french fries. The fried pickles were yummy and so were the cheese curds, although the curds were a little expensive for the portion. This place is kinda fancy, and burgers are around $9, plus an extra $2 for fries. Shakes are anywhere from $5-6. Try it out if you want that boutique burger experience, but they need to step up their flavors a bit."}
{"text":"Came here on a game day and it pretty much was Mimosa central in the restaurant. I was a bit worried about it being too crowded but the staff does a pretty good job with efficient and friendly service.  I had a mushroom breakfast sandwich as well as a chocolate peanut butter pretzel shake. The mushroom was nicely cooked, juicy but still firm. I loved the shake. Not too sweet with little bits of pretzels and peanuts inside. Will definitely be back to try to the burgers."}
{"text":"My wife and I came here for a second time for a Tuesday night dinner. We were initially seated in a booth where most of the diners were, but they honored our request to be seated somewhere more quiet, in the far corner of the room where no one else was being seated.  Our server was Tory. She was average; not terrible, not stellar. She happily explained the specials a couple times to us because we were pretty indecisive.  We started with the fried pickles, which is always delicious. My wife ordered the Farmhouse burger (bacon, monterey jack cheese, fried green tomato, baby greens, a side of house-made tomato jam). She loved the tomato jam and dipped her burger in it. The sweetness was a nice compliment to the savory burger. She ordered a side of bleu cheese and bacon fries, and I discovered that I really don't like bleu cheese. She loves it, so she was satisfied. I ordered the special that night, which was a 1/3 lb burger crusted with black peppers and fritos...and a bunch of other stuff going on. It was good. I had a side of sharp cheddar and green onion fries, which was delicious.   We're working on trying out all the burgers on their menu and maybe even some shakes, so we'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"This is my favorite burger joint in Madison. I love the atmosphere and the food is always great. I don't think I've ever had a bad burger or appetizer or anything from this place and I've been coming here about once a month or more.   Even when the restaurant is packed, which is almost all the time, the service is still quick and friendly.   Make sure to come here for brunch and order the bottomless Mimosas!"}
{"text":"Been here many times for brunch, dinner, happy hour, etc. and always enjoy my experience.  While visiting Madison this past weekend, I decided to start the weekend off right by heading to DLUX (also the wait at Old Fashioned was 2.5 hours). The wait here wasn't as bad but we decided to grab a spot at the bar since it is first come first serve.   I ordered the Standard Burger - lettuce, tomato, onions, pickles, american cheese, mayo (sub cheddar cheese, hold the mayo). Not the best burger I've ever had but it always does the trick if I'm craving a burger!  For drinks, I ordered the Whisky Smash - buffalo trace bourbon, lemon, mint, seltzer - deeelicious!  I would definitely recommend DLUX, especially for brunch (bottomless mimosas) and their 2 for 1 happy hour special."}
{"text":"Really the only downside of this great place is that you wish it could seat more people.  Great food, unique and cool décor, and amazing specialty items.  I'm a huge personal fan of unlimited mimosas for $10 Saturday and Sunday mornings.  The parmesan and truffle fries and red velvet milkshakes are both the best of those categories that I've ever had.  The homemade French onion dip is also phenomenal.  Every burger I had is unique and excellent.  Great date place, or just a really unique place for guests from out of town.  Sensational in a word."}
{"text":"Good burger! We were in Madison and heard DLUX was casual and good so we gave it a shot. It was Sunday and the packers were playing later in the day, plus Sundays are unlimited mimosa day, so it was full but not overly crowded. The wait for a table was 45 minutes but luckily 3 seats were open at the bar for us so we took that option.    Service was attentive and not overbearing. Burger was pretty great, as were the fries. Good selection of draft brews, many local."}
{"text":"I went for lunch.  The server was very friendly and the food was top notch.  Cheddar chive fries were to die for.  Will definitely go back."}
{"text":"I have nothing bad to say about DLUX. Everything I tried was delicious. The burgers were the perfect size, the sweet potato fries were amazing, and the shakes are the perfect ending to the meal. I was perfectly satisfied with my experience and would definitely suggest it if you have the opportunity."}
{"text":"I went here with friends and ordered the DLUX with the black bean patty. The patty was flavorful and the port-wine onion marmalade was delicious! My friends enjoyed their cheese curds, too. I would definitely be back to try another of their unique burgers."}
{"text":"DLUX serves up the kind of brunch atmosphere that yuppies Wisconsinites probably go nuts for. I went with a few friends on a Saturday morning. DLUX is sleek, had mimosas, and offered solid vegetarian food: what else could the forever young twenty-something, environmentally conscious, \"leaning Bernie Sanders but often says some weirdly Donald Trump-ish things out loud\" millennial ask for?  I ordered the mushroom sandwich: it had a portobello mushroom cap, a fried egg, swiss cheese, topped with a truffle-cream sauce. I also ordered some fried cheese curds for the table, which came with this low viscosity ranch-dill dipping sauce. The mushroom sandwich was very tasty. It was filling, affordable, and all five sandwich components worked together well. I've got nothing but high praise for the fried egg: fried eggs need to be on more sandwiches. The fried cheese curds were tasty too. The coating on the cheese curds was light, and a bit peppery. I didn't really care for the dipping sauce.  I would come back if I were looking for brunch in Madison, and probably order a mimosa too."}
{"text":"This place has great burgers, their cheese curds are pretty good too (nicely seasoned and come with a dill ranch). The service was timely and they have pretty good shakes too!"}
{"text":"Husband and I went there early afternoon on Saturday Dec. 6th. Sleek decor. Sat at the window so we didn't have to wait. We could tell some people were taking full advantage of the bottomless mimosas and they got loud.   We didnt do the Bloody Mary bar, but it looked like the deluxe model: olives, veggies, salami, cheese! I had the a Wisconsin Brewing Co. Porter--pretty good. Husband had the peanut butter chocolate pretzel shake and he says it was incredible. I liked the flavor, but I tend to not like gritty textures in ice cream.  The Reuben burger (only a special) was excellent tasting but could have used slightly more corned beef and less sauerkraut. The ratio was just a bit off. Very juicy and well done. The sweet potato fries were some of the best I've had. Large cut so you can taste the potato. Sriracha mayo wasn't very spicy but added a contrast tang to the fries. Backyard BBQ burger with a chicken burger substitute was my husband's choice and he liked it. He ordered the Parmesan fries and they were really covered with the white cheese sauce."}
{"text":"I'm honestly torn between a 4 and 5 because 5(\"perfect\") seems really unrealistic for anywhere I've been.   Greats 1. Saturday/Sunday brunch stuff. 10am-3pm. I feel like I shouldn't even be saying it because it's already pretty busy and I imagine it'll only be busier this summer. It's annoying to try to get a seat  sometimes but its not due to lack of space..just incredible popularity at the moment..   2. Bloody Mary Bar. Awesome fun for Bloody Mary fans. $8 adds up quick but it honestly feels fair due to the quality of the ingredients and the mix.  3. $10 botomless Mimosas.  4. Food Entrees. I'm a vegetarian so I don't share some of the concerns that others have had. I've had both the meatless options that are offered in the \"sorta burgers\". I can tell they have a good taste and an emphasis on minimalistic/fresh ingredients. I wouldn't say I enjoy them as much as something like Red Robin but I can tell they're \"better for me\". The southwest bean one might be a tad too spicy for me and I actually tend to like hot food.  5. Food Desserts. The donuts with the strawberry glaze was good. Probably the most gluttonous thing I've gotten at a restaurant but awesome.   6. Music - Someone likes Rooney? :P"}
{"text":"Bland bland bland - extra bland. I'm pretty surprised, usually places over season their food imo - not here!   The fried pickles were really good, however the chicken burger and french fries were somehow flavorless. I think this place would benefit from having some sauces on top of the burger - it's like  McDonalds chicken nuggets you know? They have no flavor as well unless you dunk it in sauce. That's how the chicken burgers are like here, not bad - just flavorless."}
{"text":"To quote Sam Jackson:  \"DAMN! Now THAT is a tasty burger!\"  But seriously though, DLUX has great burgers, fabulous apps (sweet potato fries that actually taste GOOD!), and super friendly staff. I'd go back in a heartbeat.  OK OK, so I'm a Chicago expate, and I have some expectations on what a burger and a beer should cost. Every single gastro pub style burger joint in Madison has been just wild and crazy cheap. DLUX is no exception, you'll be in and out for under 20, which is just absurd for where I'm from."}
{"text":"DLUX is one of my favorite restaurants in madison. It is one of my late-night-and-I'm-starving go-to spots. It's also great for family dinners, dates... You name it.  Drinks:  They have some amazing mixed cocktails, but the beer is the shining star. All craft beers on tap (some domestic/imported non-craft, and other craft beers by the bottle). Feel free to sample to find the one you love.  Food:  There are only 4 appetizers, but that's a the cheese curds are pretty freaking amazing.  Also the buffalo chicken nachos are probably one of my favorite things to get.  The burgers are all excellent, and make sure to ask your server (or usually in my case your bartender) about their burger and shake of the month. It changes each month.  The burgers are all unique, my two favorites being the DLUX burger and the green chile burger.  Also during the fall, the Harvest Burger is amazing.  The shakes are all Sassy Cow Creamery, and I have yet to find one I don't like, plus a free shake on your birthday.  Also, ask your bartender about making it boozy, they usually have some good recommendations, and its only $3 extra.  Service:   I've never in all the times I've eaten at DLUX had anything but spectacular service."}
{"text":"Bottomless mimosasss... truly, do I need to say more? Your limit is two hours, which is actually quite shorter than you might think. But some of the servers really work hard to help you out. I observed a guy, with six minutes left, downing a glass and then holding it up to be refilled after the server had refilled the others' at the table... and she did refill his again. The countdown continued, and he kept drinking.   The food was so excellent. We had the donut holes, the fried pickles, and the fried cheese curds. And truly the only complaint I had over any of those things was that there were only a few curds. Like maybe six or eight.. the fried pickle quantity was good though. So many, so warm, so crunchy... I wish I had them in my life right now again today.   I also had the parm and truffle cream potatoes, and split the spicy sausage sandwich and the Portobello mushroom sandwich. The Portobello was a total winner. Not entirely sure if I loved the sausage one though. The meat felt.. softer than I expected. But it tasted good nonetheless. And the food came out quick enough.  The atmosphere is fun--it's a little loud though. Not sure if that's due to the music or because everyone is drunk, but it definitely isn't a place for intimate conversation... not that you'd be doing that over bottomless mimosas.   One stars docked for the weirdest thing I've ever seen happen to someone in my party. My friends and I all paid separately, and one friend didn't tip much...like less than 10% I think. Not sure why, but by the time the check came, my head was pretty fuzzy because mimosas. And the servers came over to her, and asked her what they needed to do better and if anything was wrong with their service. It was hella awkward for everyone witnessing that conversation. My friend has been a server. I know a ton of people who have or were. And I eat out a lot... and I have never witnessed that happen ever, to anyone. (I always tip 15% minimum). Anywho, that was just a baffling experience."}
{"text":"I am a huge fan of brunch, and my obsession with it only grows when I come to DLUX.  Their weekend brunch menu, with unlimited mimosas and bloody mary bar is a perfect way to celebrate the weekend.   The atmosphere here is hip and trendy, but not in a way that is uncomfortable.  It draws a young crowd but by that I mean young professionals, not just the college folks.  Weekend brunch times are packed here, but that is probably because everyone else loves this place as much as I do.   Favorite Item on the Menu: Their shakes are to die for.  My favs are the red velvet or the Chocolate Peanut Butter Pretzel."}
{"text":"Awesome late night hang out if you're wanting good American food! The service was wicked slow, but the food and drinks were great. I highly recommend any of their gin and tonics. I can't wait to go back and get a milkshake!"}
{"text":"Met some good friends here after work on a Friday a while back. Sat outside on the 'patio' seating in front. Very nice area and the weather was excellent - so that didn't hurt.   After a few beers which were outstanding - we tried a few items from their menu. We shared the Cheesy Spinach & Artichoke option from the Apps. Veggies and garlic crostini with a nice dip. I'm not a big broccoli fan, so I stuck with the carrots and crostini. It was good, not great but decent.   Then we tried a few burgers. I got the Sunrise - fried egg, pepperjack cheese, housemade tomato jam and shoestring potatoes. It was really excellent - the tomato jam was a bit odd - but definitely unique and yummy. The bun was very fresh and the burger was top notch. I hope to try more of their burgers down the road.   Some of our friends tried their shakes. Guess they had them before and raved about the Chocolate Peanut Butter Pretzel shake. Didn't try but it looked good."}
{"text":"Had a great experience when trying DLux last weekend! My husband and I were excited to find a restaurant near the capitol with good food at a decent price and fun atmosphere. We each had a burger and split an order of the green onion fries, and were not disappointed. The flavor of our burgers and the fries was amazing. Just wish the location was a bit bigger, as we were seated at a table right next to another table, about a half arm-length away, and it was difficult to have our own conversations and sit comfortably. Service could have been better, as our waitress was very slow with taking our order, refilling our waters, and bringing us the bill, but the food was so good we will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"Visited DLUX with my wife for a late night Saturday dinner when passing though the Madison area. First off, the ambiance was awesome. The decor is very modern and the lighting is very cool. I also noticed the excellent music playlist that was going, it sounded just like a playlist that I would have put together. The music was loud enough to create a mood, but quiet enough as to not make conversation difficult at the table.  The food was also excellent. I got a mushroom and swiss burger that was fantastic. Truffle fries...also fantastic. My wife got the Green Goddess salad, which she very much enjoyed.  Good service and reasonably priced. Would definitely go back!"}
{"text":"My son and I both had the Spicy Hawaiian and split a large order of sweet potato fries with Sriracha mayo, and all the food  was excellent. We sat at the bar and also for great service. The bartender missed my beer on the ticket, so I just added $5 to the tip to cover it.   Our only mistake was coming in at the end of the Saturday brunch, because everyone was drunk on unlimited mimosas, and the noise was almost unbearable."}
{"text":"I would come here for brunchfor their unlimited mimosas, but if you're looking for real brunch food: eggs, Benedict, scrambles, etc..I would pass. they have good burgers and breakfast sandwiches, but I usually prefer a Benedict or scrambler for brunch. If you go for dinner... Their burgers are goooodddd"}
{"text":"Definitely coming back here.  Great burgers, good size and good price. Awesome sweet potato fries and shakes. Fries aren't included in the price of the burger. Menu is simple.  It's a bit dark and kind of loud, but that seems to go with the good restaurants downtown."}
{"text":"This burger place is wildly creative on its flavor use on burgers. If you like the same old traditional burger place, you could just as easily go to dotty's. (Not that they won't make those traditional burgers here too.) THAT BEING SAID, they have great GREAT burgers here. Their burgers are amazing and combine flavors like no other burger place I've been before. Definitely give it a try. I recommend the farmhouse."}
{"text":"Going into DLUX I was not quite sure what to expect, but thinking Madison burger joint I assumed the typical, decent grass fed beef served at many places around the square. I was pleasantly surprised to find something very unique to the area. The flavors are fresh and the atmosphere is somewhat big city without the high prices. While I'm excited to go back to try everything else on the menu, it will be hard to stray from the amazing DLUX burger with cheddar and green onion fries.  The burgers hold that perfect amount of charbroiled flavor while leaving room for some incredible topping choices. Aside from the food, the drink menu is also worth a trip in itself. The Hawaii 5-0, made with a DLUX-made strawberry soda, was a refreshing flavor that I will be revisiting soon. Last but certainly not least the shakes are a perfect ending to the meal. Featuring different flavors such as toasted marshmallow and red velvet the menu is truly complete with these dessert additions. I think that my favorite part about this restaurant is that it is extremely versatile...I could pop in at lunch for a burger, fry and shake, stop in after work for a drink and the game or take it a step up at night for a classy, affordable date night."}
{"text":"I've been here quite a few times, only for lunch or dinner. I usually order the green goddess salad. I am a big fan of the ambiance and service I usually get here.   My one piece of advice here: definitely order the loaded fries! My favorite is the blue cheese & bacon.  It's never wowed me,but I've never left disappointed or hungry, so what more can you really ask for?"}
{"text":"We have been frequent customers at Dlux for both dinner and brunch. Hands down, they have the best cheese curds in Madison. We often tell people this and they argumentatively and adamantly disagree. Then the next time we meet they confess and tell us how they re-ordered another round of curds.  Anything Dlux does that includes cheese is very good.   We also really enjoy brunch. Not only do they have amazing sandwiches (for cheese fanatics) but their espresso milk shake is surprisingly good.   The reason I took 1 star off is due to Dlux switching their burger recipe. Dlux used to have the absolute best moderate priced burger in town. My fiancée and I got \"the standard\" every time we visited along with their great sweet potato fries. While the fries are still amazing something changed with their burger patty sometime in late 2015 that made the burger taste different. We've encountered a handful of other couples that noticed the same thing. Really hope they bring back their old patty.   I really wish I could give them 3.5 stars. I would take half a star off for their cocktail menu and selection. We love craft cocktails but Dlux isn't strong in that department.   My recommendations if you go there. Cheese curds, a burger of your choice with sweet potato fries and finish it off with one of their specialty shakes. If their fortune cookie shake is on the menu first order one...then make sure to message me. We miss it."}
{"text":"The DLUX burger is amazing, as well as the cheddar cheese and green onion fries! So delicious. Their milkshakes are scrumptious! You really can't go wrong with anything here. Love their monthly burgers and shakes."}
{"text":"Super delicious burgers, stellar kegged cocktails and awesome late-night happy hour specials. The sweet potato fries are my favorite. They also have boozey milkshakes. Yum."}
{"text":"I am not a meat burger person, but the Green Goddess salad at DLUX is often one of my go-to's. The french fries are always cooked fantastically (surprising how many places in the area don't cook them very well) and the milkshakes are some of the absolute best I've ever had. I actually prefer them without the booze, but a boozy milkshake is never something to complain about. They've always had a good selection of beers, and I always am meaning to try their veggie burgers but I just can't stop ordering the salad... I'll get there someday. Gets very loud and busy on weekend nights and for the lunch crowd, but at the quieter times it's a great spot if you're downtown."}
{"text":"We were drawn in by their $12 bottomless mimosas, which was nice! However, their food was sub-par. Their \"fried chicken and waffles\" was a fried, once frozen, chicken nugget patty and their waffle was small and made of generic batter. I would rather spend the extra couple bucks on mimosas at another restaurant."}
{"text":"Really disappointed with the burgers.  We went to Doty Dumplings Dowry but there was a half hour wait so we decided to try a new place... Big mistake.   The red velvet shake was good.  The onion dip chip appetizer was good.  We ordered two cocktails including the Hawaii 5-0 and found them both terribly sweet.  Now... The sad part...  The burgers were over cooked and not very good quality.  They never asked how we wanted the burgers cooked so I'm left to believe everything is cooked like a hockey puck?  I tried the salmon burger.  It was good, but not good enough to compensate for the burger fail.  Next time... Going to Doty Dumplings Dowry!!"}
{"text":"Tori is an amazing server. We can always get a table, especially before trivia night! Awesome boozy pretzel milkshake. The cheese curds and buffalo nachos are amazing. The salmon burger rocks! Come here for Moscow mules!"}
{"text":"Great burgers and fries. Drink selection is poor and over priced. Nice place to grab a quality burger in style. Service is adequate, if you go alone though prepare to be mostly ignored."}
{"text":"Very fast and good service. Good burger but the cheddar green onion fries were delicious"}
{"text":"Good drinks and good brunch food. I've been here twice for the Weekend Recovery and once for late-night drinks. It's always good service, good people, good food; however, my only qualm is that it's so small! This means that the wait is always long and the bar area is usually packed. I hate not being able to move when out at a bar for casual drinks, so that's an issue. Their drinks are so yummy, though, that it's easy to forgive. I would suggest trying the Sugar Mama - delicious grapefruit!  Would come here for dinner and drinks or midday brunch on a weekend."}
{"text":"Everything we ordered was amazing, staff was nice, decore was great.  There's nothing on the menu I wouldn't eat and I'm definitely going back.  The portions are perfect - just enough to be filling but not ridiculously huge.  And the prices are definitely right, especially for the quality and location.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Hip yet friendly, affordable yet delicious. Doesn't happen often, but I found all of the above at Dlux.   Fries, burgers, cocktails- everything I tried was great. I can't wait to go back and try a shake.  Oh, and call on your way over- they'll put your name on the wait list. We arrived at 8pm on a Saturday and were seated immediately. Can't beat that!"}
{"text":"Ok, about a month late with this review.  Went on a Friday with friends before concert on the rooftop.  Fantastic house drinks!   Great beer selection, includin gluten free. Apps were as good as the drinks.  Burgers!  Dlux was great.  Quick late review.  Five stars."}
{"text":"The food is great and he staff is really friendly! The big draw here are the boozy milkshakes which are so amazing!  Combine that with some truffle fries and that makes for a wonderful evening!"}
{"text":"YES.  1. Creative burgers 2. Crispy fries 3. Tasty housemade sodas 4. Trivia night  I wish I lived in WI because I'd be here all the damn time."}
{"text":"I live for how swanky and sophisticated the interior is. You never would expect this to be a burger joint considering the look of the restaurant or the formal uniforms the staff wear. Feels kind of nice mowing down on a cheeseburger in what looks to be a 5 star restaurant. Too bad it doesn't quite fit the bill. It's more like a 3.  The service was hit and miss. Nothing special. The staff mingled with one another most of the evening at the bar. Had to ask for refills. Service wasn't really engaging, but rather monotone.   The food was alright. I had the Sunrise Burger. Although I can see why people would enjoy it, it honestly wasn't my thing. The tomato jam was much too sweet and overpowered the burger. When I found bites without the jam, it tasted as if it was from the dollar menu at McDonald's, really. The sharp cheddar and green onion fries were my meals saving grace. All aside, you can't beat the prices here. Burgers are only $8 with a small side of specialty fries being $3. A dinner date for two only cost 29 bucks not including tip.  In the end I think I'm gonna go venture to the gazillion other restaurants in the area, and then perhaps I'll come back to DLUX again for another try."}
{"text":"Good burgers, great prices. The fries were soaked in a cheese sauce so we only ate the top half. Between the bartender constantly tucking in her shirt and scooping ice with a glass it grossed me out. Especially after watching the news about exactly that."}
{"text":"Nice brunch, Bloody Mary bar, all u can drink mimosa, etc. awesome donuts with strawberry cream sauce. Awesome specialty burgers. Smaller portion sizes. Good enough to make you want to go back again eventually, but not an absolute favorite, go-to, regular, good ole standby place. Slightly pretentious imo in terms of thinking they are greater than they are. Don't get me wrong, very good, but not the best ever."}
{"text":"I often grab lunch in this cool and modern restaurant.  I've never had a bad meal here and the service is always top notch.  If you have calories to spare, try one of their specialty shakes.  Oh, and the sweet potato fries are heavenly!"}
{"text":"Yes, you can get a good meatless meal here.  I'm going to tell you how.  Order the white bean burger.  Have you ever had a white bean burger?  Neither had I.  Your average vegetarian has eaten far more soy burgers, black bean burgers, and pressed vegetable patties (which are gross) than they care to count.  But I had never seen a white bean burger.    Now you also want some sriracha mayo.  It comes with the sweet potato fries.  The sweet potato fries are good, but you're really after the mayo.    Ready?  Okay, now you're going to put the sriracha mayo on the white bean burger.  Take a bite.  You're welcome.    The white bean burger by itself is nowhere near as exciting as it sounds on the menu.  It's good, but it's not amazing.  But, with the addition of the sriracha mayo, you have yourself a mighty fine burger.  I sincerely believe that the burger should come with the sriracha mayo by default."}
{"text":"The food here is incredible! Delicious. Unique. Made with true craft. And it won't break the bank to grab brunch, lunch, dinner, drinks, apps or shakes! Whatever you are in the mood for, you will find it here at DLUX!"}
{"text":"Went here for brunch today. The donuts were awesome, the sweet potato fries were awesome, and the sriracha mayo was awesome. The sunrise burger was a little strange because it was too sweet. The Parmesan truffle cream fries were too saucy and got kind of soggy. The sausage breakfast sandwich was good but nothing special. For the prices, the food was very good. The bottomless mimosa deal is really good."}
{"text":"We ended up here Memorial Day morning because our first choice (Marigold Kitchen) was closed...I can't recommend this place to vegans but the meals our friends had looked great. Your typical vegan options are salads and fries. They don't offer dairy-free creamer?. When I asked if they had any our waitress wasn't sure and said she'd check, then she never brought the sugar or normal creamer. The coffee was diner coffee as one of my friends commented on and sugar didn't help. (At least it was only 2.50).  My partner had the Thai sesame salad and enjoyed it. We also had a full order of the fries which were good but I definitely wanted a breakfast item which wasn't available for our lifestyle. I had an order of the plain breakfast potatoes for $2. Basically just fried potatoes which seemed dry and flavorless. Others had them smothered in Blu cheese and cheddar cheese which didn't seem any more interesting.  Others in our group had the spicy sausage egg sandwich, and two eggs Benedict I think. Both boys finished their Benedict's but my friend didn't finish her sausage sandwich. I think I heard her say it was too greasy. What with fried egg, oily sausage and a buttered bun I can agree.   Service could have been better. As I mentioned I had to ask a few times for sugar and cream. Coffee we had to wait for refills and she was constantly asking us if she could get anything else about every five minutes.   Overall our bill was cheap because we had to order a la carte.  2.5/5"}
{"text":"My husband and I went to Madison for a trip and I was excited to try cheese curds. I ordered mushroom & swiss melt chicken burger and my husband ordered Margherita Chicken. They were both amazing, if you like slightly sweet flavors go with mushroom & swiss melt. You can get any of their burgers with chicken or with portabella mushroom. Ofcourse we also had Cheese curds. O-M-G yes come to mama! They are food orgasm.  Just saying... The restaurant itself is very posh looking bar meets restaurant. I will say must try if you are in the area. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I definitely want to come back and try more food here. Trust me, you'll want to do the same.   French Onion Dip - House-made chips and French onion dip. This is absolutely amazing and a great choice for a starter. It's going to pack some flavor while not filling so heavy as you wait for your burger.    Cheese curds - A little heavier appetizer but it's definitely worth getting. Very cheesy which is all you can ask for.   Frito Bandito Burger - Roasted poblanos, cream cheese, white cheddar, Fritos and bacon. I chose this one although I couldn't really make up my mind. I was thoroughly impressed however. So much flavor and the bacon added a nice crispy element. I always asked for a side of aioli if they have it. I enjoyed it.   Fries - The Parmesan & truffle cream fries were my favorite while the sharp cheddar and green onion fries were also good."}
{"text":"Ate outside here during the Art Fair and had some really good food and service. I had the Margherita chicken sandwich which was fairly big and full of flavor. Nice bun as well. My friend had the southwest chicken salad which was equally good. Sandwich came with chips that were very good too."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying: the burgers were great.  We called ahead to be placed on their \"waiting list\" since they do not accept reservations. A table was open for us when we arrived, and after a few minutes of waiting for a host or manager we were seated. We waited a while longer for a waitress.  We had cheese curds - which were amazing with hints of cracked black pepper. Two of us tried the soup de jour, which was a beer cheese. It had dill and a variety of other herbs in it which made it interesting but it was a loose base and pretty chunky. Not my favorite. Three of us had burgers and one had a chicken sandwich. The burgers were all great. Juicy and cooked perfectly. The patties were a little small for the buns, but that can be overlooked. Mine was the DLUX - With arugula, marinated onions and a bleu cheese spread. I also had their hand cut Parmesan and Truffle Cream fries which were on point. (Fries and other sides are not included with your burger - they are a small up-charge.)  My biggest complaint about this restaurant was service. I did not feel like anyone greeted us or that anyone cared we were there. The burgers were great, but overall we felt like outsiders. We may give it another shot sometime to see if service is better."}
{"text":"Thought it was in general an okay spot for burger and shake in town.  The interior of Dlux has a nice and modern looking. It extends to an outdoor patio which is great for summer time. The seating was comfortable. Staff was very pleasant. I got a Dlux burger and their seasonal shake. I also had a side of cole slaw and sweet potato fries. I like their shake, and it was an okay burger. For a menu that serves only burgers as entrees  I would expect their burgers to be more than an okay. Cole slaw was alright, and what came out surprising, was how great their sweet potato fries ! If that pair with a better burger, I would think I would have enjoyed that even more."}
{"text":"Saturday lunch on the Square - a very pleasant option with NO waiting, a low noise level and great burgers! The menu says ALL burgers are 8 dollars. note - there are no sides included, so the burger comes looking a little bit lonely on the plate. but that is OK. The Salmon burger with wasabi mayo and a jicama/carrot slaw was delish. The bun was mildly whole wheat and slightly warmed. The Bloody Mary was VERY GOOD- and very pretty, with a sword of olives and pickles. I called that my salad!! I will go back to try more burger choices and some of the sides, like the sweet potato fries seen at a neighboring table. they looked awesome. Service was quick and pleasant.  The space is modern and well- Spacious. The \"game\" was on - but the sound was OFF - Thank you so much!! I confess I am one of those people in this town who is NOT totally into the football thing."}
{"text":"This place is excellent for bottomless mimosas and the do-it-yourself bloody mary bar. However, the burger was not as good as other local Madison establishments and I did not really enjoy the truffle cream fries."}
{"text":"Slightly upscale burger place near the capitol.  Nice decor, courteous wait staff.  My issue with the burgers is that they cook them all to well-done.  There's full disclosure of this policy on the menu, but my burger was VERY well-done, much more so than I would have liked.  The parmesan truffle fries were quite good, as were the sweet potato fries.  The shakes were nothing to write home about, I had the peanut butter pretzel shake and it was kind of unappetizing after the first half a dozen swallows.  Our waitress dropped off the bill and then disappeared for half an hour.  We didn't mind, they had the Badgers game on, but it wasn't quick to pay and leave.    The prices are maybe a little high for what you get, but it's not bad.  We would probably only go there again with a big group to watch the game."}
{"text":"I went for lunch with my wife. She had a burger, I had a chicken sandwich. Both were fresh and tasted good. The blue cheese bacon fries were freaking awesome.   Lastly the shakes were delicious. I'm not one to put a lot of odd stuff in my shake. They were very accommodating when I asked them to omit an ingredient. My wife got shake as is. Both were GREAT.   I was skeptical of this place initially, but was glad I went. We'll definitely go back."}
{"text":"I went for brunch on a Sunday.   Had the bacon egg sandwich, regulars breakfast potatoes. My friend also got a chocolate peanut butter pretzel milkshake.   Egg sandwich was okay. Description said fried egg, which I usually take to mean a non runny yoke, but apparently I'm wrong. The bun is super soft and just becomes soggy. Im not looking to have another one anytime soon. I'm from the east coast where breakfast sandwich are a way of life, so my standards might just be higher.   The breakfast potatoes were awesome. They are deep fried, which I liked but my friend did not. Just a matter of preferences.   The milkshake was hands down outrageously delicious.   Service was great. I'm only giving three stars because I was not impressed and was expecting a more classic brunch spot."}
{"text":"Honestly, I'm teetering between 3 and 4 stars. I wish Yelp gave half stars (I say this every time), but I'm going to round down on this one. Went to DLux for the first time this past weekend. I don't really like their motto of \"General Swank\" or whatever it is--seems a bit pretentious. However, Food Fight is usually pretty solid (save for Bluephies), so this was worth a shot.  I got the farmhouse burger, which was monterrey jack cheese, bacon, a fried green onion and a side of tomato jelly. The jelly was pretty awesome--I think it may have had curry or garam masala in it--I couldn't quite pinpoint the flavors. Fried green tomato was so-so--pretty bland, actually. Now, the burgers--they don't let you specify doneness. This annoyed me to no end, because ALL the burgers are well done. I prefer some flavor in mine, so it was a let down overall.  Redemption: The cheese and green onion fries? Wow. Fantastic. Some of the best I've had in the area.   Overall? 3 stars. Would I go back? Yes, they certainly deserve another chance. I just want some more imagination and flavor punches in my burger."}
{"text":"Good burgers, good prices, strange little restaurant.  Burgers are a little bit blander than they should be, which would be easily remedied with a hotter skillet and better sear on the burgers. But the 'farmhouse' with a fried green tomato was fun and came with an OK tomato chutney, and the 'standard' was standardly good. The burger with corned beef was verging on great but was super duper salty. And for those who are considering non-red meat options, the whitefish sandwich was fine and did the trick, though not much better than that.   For $2 you can get a bowl of fries with béchamel-based toppings. The blue cheese with bacon was pretty good but lacked blue cheese. Similarly, the truffle-parmesan fries are literally a stroke of cheese-sauce genius, brought back to remedial quality by not having enough truffle flavor.   The housemade soda with grapefruit and lime is another great idea, but like the béchamel fries it was much blander than it should have been. I liked it, but a stronger hit of either grapefruit or lime would have made for a destination drink instead of shtick.  The dining room has a full-on identity crisis. It's so dark you can barely see your table and full of faux-pop-art, yet it's populated by children drinking milkshakes and old people. It's occupied by a gigantic bar in the middle of the room that easily loses the restaurant 10 additional tables, yet prices are surprisingly low and there's a big wait for seating.   Overall I like the concept though this place doesn't excel in any specific category except for Wisconsin eccentricity."}
{"text":"Good solid burger, some creative plates. Limited menu, good value, convenient location. Amazing decor. Great fries!"}
{"text":"Overall: Great brunch experience! Bottomless mimosas and unhealthy food are a great mix.  The good: Great tasting food and presented well. Great brunch specials too. The service was excellent and friendly and attentive. The atmosphere is clean and modern and welcoming.   The bad: Not too much, maybe a tad too expensive for the amount of food and the quality. Still great. Sides are a la cart.   Atmosphere: 9/10 Service: 9/10 Food: 8/10"}
{"text":"Young, artsy atmosphere that is welcoming to all. The service was fantastic each and every time I have been there, regardless of how busy it was.   The portobello caprese sandwich is phenomenal, especially paired with truffle fries and a red velvet milkshake!  Can't go wrong here: there are options for everyone, the price is right, and the service and atmosphere are splendid."}
{"text":"I come here fairly often because, come on, who can pass up a bottomless mimosa or a darn good bloody Mary bar on the reg? Today, however, I've found out I've been doing it all wrong. I used to get the spicy sausage with the truffle and parmesan potatoes. Pretty great, very happy. But yesterday, since I knew I was going to be coming back today, I thought I would mix it up a little.   Chicken fried chicken. Oh. My. Goodness. It's SPOT ON. Fried egg, perfectly fried chicken, and just the right seasoning to make it mouth watering. I've now had it two days in a row and it's been just great. I've found a new favorite breakfast sandwich in Madison!  I only subtract a star because, man, the wait gets INTENSE on the weekends. But they are pretty good at managing the flow. Just remember that they don't seat until everyone is there! This isn't a place to lie and say you have 8 when you really have 10 either-don't incur the wrath."}
{"text":"Finally got a chance to try their burgers here. Not disappointed! The cheese curds and fried pickles were a good way to kick off the meal. The sharp cheddar and green onion fries were amazing as well--the cheese wasn't too much and I found myself scraping the bottom of the bowl to clean it up. Mmmm cheese!  I'm a sucker for mushroom and swiss burgers so that was a no-brainer for me: the truffle cream sauce was a bit messy to eat with but it gave the burger a bit more of a flavor than usual.   My brother enjoyed his DLUX burger--he's not a fan of arugula, but he didn't mind it on this one. He actually thought that it was needed. Go figure!  My fiance ordered the Sunrise burger, which he thought it was unusual that there was tomato jam. But he LOVED it. He thought it actually gave it the kick it had--but he wished that the fried egg wasn't so overdone. He wanted some of that yolk dripping off the burger with each bite.   Overall, definitely a place to eat burgers. Maybe when there's room in our bellies we'll try some of their shakes."}
{"text":"This is easy, 5 STARS. I had to go to Madison so i jumped on Yelp to see what i could find for dinner, and i saw some of the reviews for this place and decided to check it out.  Let's start with the location this is right down town Madison just a few doors down from the Capitol so if you have never seen it, there's something else you can do. DLUX is kind of small but has a little out door seating. First time here was Friday night, had to wait about 20 minutes for a table but while we waited we saw the amazing looking burgers going out to other customers, i got excited to say the least.  We sat down and our server Tory (which was great btw) told us what the restaurant was about and what they do there, We started off with an order of Cheese Curds, and i don't know what it is about Madison but every place I've been too in Madison makes awesome curds, this place is no exception. MUST TRY! I decided to try the Sunrise burger (pepper jack cheese, bacon and egg and tomato jam, let's talk about the Tomato jam for a second, I HATE tomatos so i got this on the side and thought i'd try it, and it was delicious! ) it was awesome, one of the top 5 burger places i've been too... come to think of it i need to actually make a list of them...anyway. My fiance got the spicy grilled pineapple chicken burger and she loved it, i even tried a few bites and it was good, the homemade seasoned chips were good, and we also ordered the Parmesan and truffle cream french fries which are very rich but are awesome. At the end of the meal the server told us about the milkshakes they have, and said this months special was the PB&J Shake, my Fiances eyes lit up and got that, i did some salted carmel pretzel shake and that was pretty good, though my fiance wouldn't stop raving about the PB&J Shake.    We enjoyed this place so much we decided to come back sunday for more, and will be back again soon!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and they have a vast array of menu options that they have mastered. I recommend the burgers, they usually have some pretty good deals on them either tuesday or wends, or maybe its thursday? Who knows! Figure it out place is great fuck yeah.  This is my second favorite food fight concept. Unlike their usual MO, they didn't try overly hard to be cute/gimmicky/authentic etc. with the space and they ended up doing a really good job on it. In terms of the food executions, all of the burgers are great and they usually have pretty good deals throughout the week. The booze milkshakes are highly lauded around town but they don't have one made with RumChata (which is a no brainer, how'd they over look that right!?) and I think they're a little more popular then they are well executed (the shakes I mean, not the establishment)."}
{"text":"I've been to Dlux quite a few times now and have always had a positive experience. I really like the burgers, (I usually end up deciding between the Sunrise and the White Fish & Shrimp) but the star of the meal for me is always a side of sweet potato fries! They are just so tasty and I can't get enough of the sriracha aioli. Brunch has also been a consistently good experience!"}
{"text":"On food, DLUX feels like a four, but on atmosphere, a two. The place attracts a pretty young, drunk, and loud clientele that makes it really difficult to enjoy the admittedly decent burgers and shakes. It felt like a cattle call the other day when we went late during brunch (2 p.m.) and struggled to have a conversation over the din wrought by gaggles of college girls downing their bottomless mimosas. Yeah, I sound like an old fogey. But really folks, if you're 30 or older, stop by on an off hour to enjoy the delicious milkshakes. My favorite is the toasted marshmallow, but the special shamrock shake for St. Patty's day is a close second. Beyond that, the burgers are pretty good, if a bit pricy for their petite size and lack of fries. (Fries are average, all told.) For burgers, I will stick to Mickey's Tavern for the time being."}
{"text":"Came in from Indianapolis and found this place to eat on a Sunday. Madison apparently goes pretty hard for brunch, so I was happy to be seated right away.   My girlfriend and I ordered cheese curds and milkshakes to start, which were great, and the burgers we had were excellent as well.   Despite being in unfriendly territory (we're Chicago Bears fans and came in wearing jerseys), the service was excellent. Definitely would recommend folks from out of town to go check this place out if they're looking for something good and reasonably priced in the downtown Madison area."}
{"text":"Decent burgers. Not especially juicy. Slow, inattentive service this time. Our drink orders were completed and ready at the bar long before the waitress retrieved them for us. Taco burger patty was nicely seasoned, but the cilantro spread was bland. My family liked the farmhouse and BBQ burgers. Casual, classy atmosphere."}
{"text":"We went for a quick lunch yesterday- we've been on the hunt for the best burger in Madison....the hunt is still on.  DLUX had a nice looking bar and atmosphere but the restaurant was thick with flies.  It was pretty gross and a borderline appetite-loser.    We had the caramel pecan shake, cheddar onion fries and green chile burger.  Good selections- the shake was full of actual pecans and delicious.  The consistency of the cheese on the fries was perfect and they tasted freshly cut.  The burger was good too-nice balance of ingredients.  So we might try again in the dead of winter when they fly population dies down but for now we're still on the best burger hunt......"}
{"text":"4 stars for food, 3.5 for service. If you're in the mood for an indulgent brunch, this is the place for you. Rich and cheesy breakfast sandwiches and loaded potatoes are definitely worth coming for. If you're going for the bottomless mimosa I would recommend sitting at the bar; sitting anywhere else doesn't promise you the type of \"bottomless\" you might expect. Sitting along the front it took the waitress a good long while to realize the glass was empty (even while trying to get her attention) and once she noticed, it took her even longer to bring a refill. Didn't try any other drinks but the bloody mary looked delicious. Overall good experience here."}
{"text":"Been here 6 or 7 times...they specialize in burgers, but only cook thin patties at one temp. Odd. I often go for the salads, which are solid. Love the decor and the feel, but often have to wait for a booth or table. Many young people. The atmosphere is fun, especially with young weekend crowd drinking bottomless mimosas...not a place to go for a quiet brunch after church :-)"}
{"text":"Awesome burgers, best dessert shakes (red velvet shake with vodka!!!), and even better service!  You guys rock!!!"}
{"text":"Wow, so I received a comment about by poor review.  It explained that the champagne, which I did not like, sells for $100+.  It is funny that people believe because costs a great deal then it must be good.    I am clearly offended that because I wrote in a review that I did not like the flavor, a business would remind me of its cost.  Please read with sarcasm: If something has a large price tag then it must be good.  Not to mention none of the other issues mentioned were addressed."}
{"text":"Looking for a fun date night spot? Or a place to catch a bite and some drinks before catching a show with friends? Then DLUX is the place. The decor makes it feel like something you'd find downtown Chicago, definitely more swanky than what you'd expect to find just off the square in Madison. The burgers are good, not really anything to write home about. The topping combinations are interesting (side note: they'll happily remove items from a burger but will not do substitutions) The sides and appetizers are just made for sharing. The Cheesy Spinach Artichoke Dip was really yummy and its great that it comes with veggies and garlic toasts for a little variety. The sweet potato fries were good as well and my boyfriend seemed quite pleased with his fries smothered in bacon and blue cheese. The salted caramel pecan was delicious as well. I'm still a little on the fence about having nuts in a milkshake though."}
{"text":"If you're here for the bar, you'll probably enjoy yourself. I was pretty let down by the food, though.   The host was very courteous and even allowed our party of 5 to squeeze into a 4-top to avoid a long wait. Our server was pretty good, but service got slower and spotty as the evening went on. It was a busy Friday night, but it still shouldn't take 20 minutes just to find someone to ask for a check. The dining room was intolerably loud and small.   I got the black bean veggie burger. The toppings were very good, but the texture of the burger and bun were lacking. The buns didn't contribute much of anything to the meal besides holding everything together, and I am curious if they are house made or packaged.   My dining partners enjoyed their selections, and I sampled a few. The salmon patty was ok, but not as flavorful as I had hoped. The beef burgers were cooked medium to medium well and had a nice flavor of their own, but got a bit lost in all the toppings and huge fluffy buns. The fried chicken burger with pimento and pickles was the one item that I would return to order, that was done very well and had many interesting flavors.   Our appetizer of french onion dip and kettle chips was quite good, but I probably wouldn't order it again honestly. At the end of the day, chips and dip is still chips and dip. The soup of the day was parsnip bisque, and it was the only item on the table that wasn't eaten up. It was cloyingly sweet and seemed a far cry from crisp tangy parsnips -- more like a chowder than a bisque.   Sweet potato fries were cooked nicely, and the accompanying spicy mayo was nice. But again, it's pretty much like any other hip burger joint with sweet potato fries. The house made sodas were nice, but just too sugary for my taste. A friend agreed that if they were to use less sweetener or simply have an unsweetened option it would be just as delicious.   Final word: it's just one more \"elevated\" burger joint. Unless you are on a mission to try every New American pub burger in Madison, I'd skip this one. Some of their promotions and happy hour specials may be worth stopping in for, though."}
{"text":"We had a real nice meal here a few weeks ago.  Service was good, food was solid overall.  The red velvet shake was top notch.  Price points were a little higher, but the quality of food also tasted better than a traditional burger joint."}
{"text":"-some of the best cheese curds in madison -awesome vegan/vegetarian options (falafel burger, walnut black bean burger) -out of this world brunch drink menu ($8 build your own bloody mar bar and $10 bottomless mimosas) -bomb cole slaw (vinegar based, not mayonnaise based) -legit milkshakes (good with whiskey) -awesome and attentive staff -great ambiance and location   a go-to for all occasions... brunch, dinner, and drinks!"}
{"text":"BRUNCH @ DLUX - it's lit!   I've been wanting to check their brunch out for the longest time, and I finally got the chance! It's so fun. Shout out to Aña, our server - she was dedicated to helping my friend and I get the most bang for our buck on the unlimited mimosa deal. 7 mimosas in 30 minutes, all thanks to Aña   BRUNCH FOOD: Subpar, unexpectedly. The sweet potato fries and Parmesan potatoes were charred, and devoid of flavor. The chicken on the chicken and waffles were in a similar shape. Hopefully that's not a constant.   I've had good food here during lunch and dinner, for sure!"}
{"text":"Wow!  Thank you again Yelp for doing us solid.  In town for my daughters state cheer championships and rolled in late and hungry.  Not a lot of traditional seating but got a bar seat with full menu in less than ten minutes.  Staff was very attentive and accommodating.  Curds and buffalo chix nachos for apps.  Both very good and just the right portion size.  Dlux and sunrise burgers were both excellent.  Cooked to perfection with great extra flavors.  The specialty flavored fries were great.  I had the pamesan truffle (yea, you read right) and I would be happy with just a plate of those.  Oh, and the salted caramel milkshake was killer.  I would love to go back, and will.  Stacks up well with other top Madison food scene stops.  Nice work Dlux!"}
{"text":"Dlux has really, truly great burgers! I've been here a few times but feel compeled to finally say something because of a truly cool thing that happened. First of all: the Frito Bandito is AMAZING, it never disappoints! The Southern Salmon and the Black Bean are really worth trying!!! Also, the burgers come only as burgers, no fries, SO! You've got to order this side: Sweet Potato Fries & Sriracha Mayo!! Totally worth getting!!! So, last time I was here, I wasn't very hungry, so I ordered the Beets & Baby Green salad, asking for no walnuts. I didn't disclose a nut allergy, just stated, \"please, no walnuts.\" Lo and behold, the salad came with walnuts and when the server came back around to check on things, I asked him (nicely!) to take it back, then disclosed the nut allergy but prefaced it wasn't a big deal. The server (Dang, how I wish I caught his name, because he was fabulous) was sincerely apologetic and then felt terrible when I told him about the nut allergy, adding, \"I can get a salad to go for you without nuts!\" I told him not to worry, it wasn't a big deal. At the end of the meal, the bill came, the salad cost was removed, a Beets and Baby Green was gifted to me, sans walnuts, and again, the waiter was so eloquentley apologetic. I LOVE THIS PLACE!! AMAZING customer service and a damned good burger to boot!!! (A \"shout out\" to the Server Dude that night!!! You are amazing!!!)"}
{"text":"I've been here a couple times now & it's safe to say, this place never disappoints! Burgers are phenomenal & the ambiance is amazing. I feel comfortable taking anyone or everyone here because I know that the food will make even the biggest foodies pleased. This has def become my go-to place in Madison!"}
{"text":"I visited DLUX on March 13,2016, this was my first and unfortunately probably my last time to visit this establishment, unless I have a friend having a special occasion there. When my party and I arrived there was a total of 5 of us, we had a reservation and were told it would be a 45 min wait, which was fine the place was packed and it was a busy weekend. We waited by the door out of the patrons way, ordered us some all you can drink mimosas and a few other drinks. We were able to talk while we waited, we did see one empty table that stayed empty for over 30 minutes of our wait, which was later filled by 3 people who came in and were seated there immediately. While we were waiting, there for 4 gentlemen in front of us siting/standing at the bar, there was one that was obviously intoxicated, which within 5 minutes of us realizing this he spilled his drink and another all over the floor. We continued to wait for our seats and about 10 minutes later the 4 gentleman finished their meals and took their drinks to a table in the back with some ladies they knew or just met. It was very obvious they were getting settled in the back booth, so we decided to sit in the open spaces at the bar so we were not crowding the door as more customers had come in and it was getting pretty crowded and fire wise not safe. As we stood and sat at the bar and ordered more drinks a bartender came up too us and told us that we could not sit there because there were already people sitting there. I informed him that those people had made their transition to the back and were obviously very comfy. I was told by another bartender that they were going to come back, because they had not paid their bill, I then continued to let them know it was obvious they were not coming back, but it was also obvious that they were not done drinking, so in my opinion I would ask them to pay their bill now or to just continue it. Both bartenders walked away and continued to talk about the situation and give us dirty looks, during this whole time neither of them were respectful, they had attitudes and very condescending. During this time  we all including two other gentlemen next to us all had empty glasses, and we were doing are best to try to get refills and new drinks. Eventually we all received drinks, as we continued to wait one of the gentlemen that had spilled his drink earlier came back to the bar to order another drink, when i asked him if he and his group were coming back he said no, they had found a new place to sit. He also said it in front of the bartender. Unfortunately the intoxicated gentleman was not done with his business with me as he started to hit on me and then became annoying belligerent and rude, I asked him to leave me alone and when that didn't work I asked the bartender who was standing right in front of us if he could ask the patron to leave me alone. The bartender then responded to me with a \" what did you do to him\" comment. I informed him nothing and that it's completely obvious this guy is drunk and won't leave me alone, my friends even chimed in to let the bartender know, he still felt it was me being a bother and ignored me. So unfortunately I had to take care of the situation myself, eventually with some rudeness the gentleman walked away from me and my group. After all of the craziness things finally settled down and we were enjoying are time, what was left of it as we were extremely annoyed with not getting much service, we did order food so we waited on that, there was no issues with food everyone enjoyed what the received. After eating we finished up are drink and left. I don't like to say that I will never come back to your business, but right now and for almost the last 3 months I have been frustrated with what happen there and I bring it up a lot to people to the point of I'm sure it's annoying. I just really dislike being treated so rudely and also with being good paying customers, to have people treat us so poorly. I know it's been a couple months and I can not control what your company does, but bringing up that :we need to work a little better on our customer service even on a busy weekend, as each and every customer is a valuable customer and one positive or negative remark about our place of business can be transferred, relayed and change a lot of peoples opinions. I do wish the establishment well and hope that no one else has to be treated the way that I was.     Thank you for taking time to listen, have a great day."}
{"text":"Wow! Finally a great burger joint the Madison can be proud of! Excellent burger combinations that are tastefully put together, along with Fries that will have your mouth excited. Not to mention, this place is partly employee owned! Who would not want to eat here?  The interior is decorated for a good Madison downtown vibe, and it is very easy to park and find. We parked in Lot 89 off MLK, and our parking was validated by DLUX!!!!!! Free parking! DLUX is the perfect atmosphere for everything from date night to just your basic social gathering spot. They even had some nice large TVs to watch football on.   The menu was priced at a medium rate, average burger price looked to be around $8. I am very excited to go back for their Sunday breakfast sandwiches and bloody Mary bar.  If I had to pick one place in Madison right now to tell someone about it would be DLUX.   A+ for you."}
{"text":"First time here today. Was much busier than expected but I guess they have bottomless mimosa on Saturday and sundays before 3pm. The restaurant is cool it has art on the walls hip music playing and nice big classic booths that wrap around. Nice square bar. The service was really good. Thumbs up to them. Food was on point. Deep fried pickles I'll be coming back for! I got the black n blue burger and my friend got the smokehouse. The hand cut fries were perfect partner to the burger, so yummy! I'll be back to try more things!"}
{"text":"I went here at almost 7p on a Thursday. Not busy at all, in fact there were many seats open. There was more traffic on the patio but we sat inside and got a comfy booth. I really enjoyed the ambiance of the place and the modern look. Their drinks are expensive so I didn't order anything but I got the farmhouse burger and fries. The burger was great. I finished it all. If I were to be picky, I didn't like the side sauce that it came with so I chose to put ketchup on it. It was an average burger, nothing bad about it but nothing to rave about to friends or family. I also wouldn't come for happy hour since their specials aren't that appealing (2 dollars off appetizers or taps and 6 dollar.. a drink of some kind, I cant remember but 6 dollars isnt a happy hour price in my book anyway). The service was great, I must say. The waitress was on time, friendly, gave opinions on what to get, and refilled water without asking! Couldn't ask for anything more. This could be because she wasn't busy but either way, I appreciated her great service. Ultimately, I wouldn't recommend this spot out of all the places on capitol square but if you do go, you'll probably leave somewhat satisfied! I don't regret trying it."}
{"text":"The restaurant mainly serves burger so if you are a burger fan, this is your place. Their special is the alcoholic milkshake and I usually take my friends here for their 21 birthday and order them an alcoholic milkshake. The Parmesan and truffle cream fries are addicting and I would definitely recommend it. It is so creamy and crunchy at the same time"}
{"text":"The burgers, which all come with exciting, not-your-average-lettuce-and-tomato toppings, are hearty and always pleasing. The cheese curds are perfectly crunchy on the outside and soft/pillowy on the inside-they're a solid 9/10! And of course, the Milkshakes are a refresher- unique from any others in that they usually have yummy chunks. They're totally a dessert, so it feels wrong to me to drink one as I eat an entrée... Maybe I'll get one after my meal next time! Come here for a good meal and a comfy booth seat!"}
{"text":"I can't add much that hasn't already been covered in the previous reviews - DLUX really does have great grub.   We ordered the parmesan truffle fries + the bleu cheese and bacon fries as appetizers for the table and they were both scrumptious. I don't like bleu cheese and I still liked the fries - a true testament to the power of bacon.  My only suggestion is to utilize their call-ahead option. They'll let you put your name on the waiting list via the phone - as long as you show up within an hour of when you called. It's not a true reservation but it really helps on a Friday night when they're quoting a two-hour wait for incoming diners (which elicits some truly priceless facial expressions)."}
{"text":"This is a regular brunch spot for my friends and I. I enjoy the turkey sausage breakfast sandwich, and love the breakfast potatoes with parmesan and truffle sauce. However, I really go for the mimosas ($10 bottomless on weekends). The waiters are always friendly and super generous on filling up your glass before it's even empty.  I also must give praise to the donut balls. I once made the mistake of not ordering them with my brunch and will never do that again. They're warm and come with a delicious strawberry glaze, not to be missed.  I cannot wait to visit later in the day to see if their other meals live up to their bunch menu!"}
{"text":"Came here for Sunday brunch. It was crowded with a pretty young crowd and loud dancy music. It's like a college bar except it's well-lit and youre there to sit down and eat instead of make regrettable decisions. While I did not find my decision to have brunch regrettable, I did not find myself impressed and wanting to return either.  Let's start with the mimosa. I know people love to go here for bottomless mimosas: 2 hours of all you can drink for $12; that's a bargain! However, I only got one since I'm not a big drinker. The drink tasted kind of cheap (which I was fine with from a place that has to make a profit off of bottomless mimosas), and it was a little warm (yuck!) and not as effervescent as I wouldve liked. To be honest, I'm a craft beer lover, so my opinion on other adult beverages is probably not to be trusted.  For food, I got cheese curds, buffalo chicken nachos, parmesan truffle potatoes, and a burger (I think it was the farmhouse).  The curds are awesome. I think the batter has pickle juice in it because the cheddar curds have a hint of dill pickle. This flavor is really brought out by the dipping sauce that is probably 50% dill by volume. I'd put these curds on my top 5 list in Madison.  The buffalo chicken nachos are pretty decent and filling. You get a big platter of house-made potato chips topped with strips of chicken breast soaking in buffalo sauce, blue cheese, diced tomatoes, and white cheddar sauce for only $9. Pretty good deal, but this was pretty much on par with appetizers at chain restaurants like buffalo wild wings, so I can't say that I loved these nachos.  The potatoes were pretty good. Sizeable cubes of battered and fried potatoes are topped with truffle-flavored cream sauce and melted parmesan cheese. I'm not going to pretend to be some truffle connoisseur and say whether or not the truffle flavor is authentic, but the truffle cream and the parmesan cheese seem to taste like a gradient with tanginess on one end and earthiness on the other. Great flavor pairing! The potatoes are hot, crispy, and just dry enough to take in the sauce nicely.  I am not the biggest fan of burgers, but they were pretty much the only thing on the menu. The toppings on this burger were interesting: bacon, cheese, fried green tomato, baby spring mix, and a sweet tomato jam. This tasted pretty good. The tomato jam provides sweet and acidic flavors to balance out the fatty and salty bacon, cheese, and beef. Still, I can't say this burger is blows me away.  Overall, I thought the food was good, but it wasn't THAT good. With all the brunch options in Madison, Dlux just doesnt seem like a stand out to me. I was going to give it three stars, but I remembered how great my service was. The waitress was fast, friendly, and helpful. She answered all of our questions, and she was accomodating when I wanted to change my fries to breakfast potatoes. I think the awesome service earned another star.  If i ever come back, i will get a milkshake. They look awesome."}
{"text":"I enjoyed my visit here. The wife and I decided to try it since we had a gift card.   We both decided on burgers since...that's what they do. They're pressed and no temps are taken - which turned out just fine. They have a decent beer list, and a bunch of drinks they're happy to make for you.  I got beer, and enjoyed it.  Service was nice, attentive without being overbearing."}
{"text":"Expensive and not very good. We had 4 burgers - 3 of us thought they were pretty tasteless and the 4th one liked it, but it wasn't worth the money. There are much better burgers in Madison. The space was energetic, but they need to do something about the sound level (put in some soft surfaces to absorb the noise). We had to yell to hear each other, and could not hear the waiter at all."}
{"text":"Truffle and parm fries. That's all you need. Now that you know this wisdom. Walk or drive over to DLUX and indulge in its amazingness.   DLUX is by far my favorite restaurant in town when it comes to getting a delicious burger with some kick-a** fries and milkshakes. The atmosphere is upbeat and has a great vibe. And lets not forget the bottomless mimosas!! I've been coming to this restaurant since it opened and I've never been disappointed. Delicious food with an awesome and attentive staff."}
{"text":"Yes, yes, yes. Madison, this is what I'm talking about. If you're looking for a good burger, from scratch shake, beer, and deep fried cheese curds, DLUX has your back.  I was pleasantly surprised by DLUX. It presents a unique atmosphere with food that I can only describe as Wisconsin cuisine (or at least what I interpret as such) done properly.  DLUX is essentially what I would describe as an \"Upscale, fancy Steak N' Shake.\" They have to die for shakes and burgers on their menu. The shakes are EXTREMELY well done. I know you may want a beer, but at least one person at your table should consider getting a shake. Rumor has it that alcoholic shakes are an option, but I wasn't looking at the time.  When our party first walked in, we were greeted by upscale, modern decor. It definitely had a clean modern feel to it with 50s styled art plastered on the walls. Seating surrounds a central bar. You can quietly hear some indie rock playing in the background.  Service was prompt and we felt well taken care of the whole time. Our server was incredibly sweet, helpful, and made sure we had everything we needed. I was actually impressed that she was so attentive, considering that the place was close to capacity when we sat down.  The beers on tap aren't too extensive, but the variety is enough to satisfy the beer snob in me. There should be at least one of everything on tap to please different tastes. Just in case, there are a few staples like the Left Hand Milk Stout. DLUX also has 1 rotating tap for those who like to try something new. Sorry, no 45 rotating taps this time.  Our party ordered a round of drinks with orders of cheese curds and jalapeno poppers for appetizers. A quick, note on the jalapeno poppers, they aren't on the menu. The server merely hooked us up when we asked. Let's put it this way, they should be on the menu. The lightly battered jalapenos had just the right about of kick and the chipotle berry sauce was incredibly well done. The table ended up keeping it for dipping fries in with the burgers. DLUX, put those poppers on the menu, they deserve the limelight, especially the sauce.  If you've read my reviews enough, you know that we are on a quest to find THE BEST cheese curds in Madison. Let's put it this way, currently Graze has our favorite, but DLUX puts on a show with these curds. We now have to revisit Graze to rank them properly. The curds are lightly battered and aren't overly greasy. The inside has squeaky and not overly gooey cheddar. Just like the jalapeno bites, it came with an amazing sauce. House made buttermilk dill dipping sauce. Very well done, kudos for making your own sauce here that wasn't too thick or thin. The consistency was just perfect for dipping something melty and breaded.  My wife ordered a peanut butter cup pretzel shake. The flavor profile was spot on. I was actually shocked that I could detect pretzel flavor and that the peanut butter didn't over power it. Nice balance, great flavor profile, perfect consistency! I actually regretted ordering my porter, which was also quite delicious.  For the main course, I ended up ordering a Farm House Burger (not pictured, sorry I took too many large bites before remembering), which is topped with bacon, a deep-fried green tomato, Monterrey jack, baby greens, and a side of sweet tomato sauce. The burger was cooked through, and it will always be cooked through. DLUX has a rule saying they only cook burgers one way. Sorry if you like a little pink in your burger, but it appears the kitchen does a good job from over cooking the burgers. It was still sufficiently juicy.   The burger was quite good. Again, the sauce was amazing. A good dish cannot stand its own without a good sauce to go with it! The tomato sauce was slightly on the sweet side, which was quite strange at first. In this case it actually worked for me. The sweet sauce paired very well with the salty, smokey bacon and the acid of the fried green tomato. All of the ingredients in this dish paired so well together. I am genuinely impressed by this burger. I am a firm believer that one should never remove ingredients from a dish unless the customer is allergic to an element. The chef (hopefully) added each ingredient for a specific reason. This burger is a prime example of that. These ingredients get along and pull out the best qualities of each other. Awesome job!  Upon leaving, I noticed that DLUX also has trivia on Sunday nights at 9pm. DLUX, we will be back for your trivia, burgers, CHEESE CURDS, jalapeno poppers, atmosphere, great service, shakes, cocktails, beer. For me, you knocked it out of the park and do an upscale burger joint right. Please keep innovating. You have set the bar high for me, and I love it. Keep doing your thing!"}
{"text":"Have been here twice now during my cross country travels. YUMMY each time, great cocktails, very good service."}
{"text":"The food here is mediocre, at best. The process of being seated is very disorganized.   As for the food...  I was shocked when I received my burger and it appeared to be a tasteless patty on a plain bun with mushroom and Swiss cheese thrown in for flavor. There are so many places in Madison with much better, more appetizing  burgers--at comparable prices. Overall the presentation quality of the food turned me off. Do not be fooled by what people think is the \"glitziness\" of this place."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed DLUX brunch. I was a big fan of their green goddess salad. They let me get a half salad with my sausage breakfast sandwich, which was superb (the apple butter really brought the standard breakfast sandwich up a notch). Great place to go before a day of tailgating."}
{"text":"Happy hour $2 off appetizers are so legit. Recommend the mac and cheese bites - 3 huge serving, fried pickles are amazing - love that batter, and the cheese curds, Bam! - your extremely healthy fried dinner for $10.  If you're in for a hearty meal, I like the Smoke Show burger, truffle fries, and for dessert the Chocolate & PB Shake (spiked with whiskey).   FYI extra sauce is $0.25 each in case you like the sauce."}
{"text":"Service was an A+   Ambiance was A+ with the decoration and music. Volume of the music was just right, you could hear it fine and didn't have to yell to be heard or strain to hear.  We went mostly to try the shakes. I didn't have one but I was told they were very good. We snacked on cheese fries too. I thought they were quite worth it. Yum"}
{"text":"Came to this place for the 1st time.  The burgers here are  so delicious.  My husband joined me and we both had their signature cocktails that were absolutely refreshing.  We will go back to visit in the near future."}
{"text":"DLUX has great burgers and even better fries. I've been here a number of times and I have never had a bad time or meal. The same goes for the drinks - their specialty cocktails are always mixed perfectly."}
{"text":"This review is only for burger/fries/shakes - not brunch. Fan-damn-tastic. For what they do....they do it right.  Creative burgers and shakes. Great fries. Cool atmosphere. Nothing wrong here AT ALL."}
{"text":"We enjoyed a late lunch in their outdoor seating area on a Sunday. They had a extensive build your own Bloody Mary bar inside, and bottomless mimosas for only $10. Our waitresses were very friendly and tentative to us and are drink glasses. They always came around and topped off my mimosa before it was empty.  I had the BBQ burger which was delicious and the Parmesan and truffle cream sauce fries (the fries were okay). But my friends had the sweet potato fries and the blue cheese and bacon fries both of which were amazing! We did not have a chance to try their shakes but they looked so tasty.  Definitely would home back!"}
{"text":"One of my Madison favorites! Most recently, we went around 7:30 on a Friday night and ended up waiting an hour for a table. They don't take reservations, so expect a wait during prime times (well worth it for the delicious food!) the restaurant uses a wait list app that allows you to check your place in line and see how long you've been waiting, so we ended up going to the Tipsy Cow for a drink while we waited.   For dinner we got the cheese curd appetizer, fried pickles, and the black bean burger with beats and goat cheese--My all time favorite veggie burger! We also ordered sides of cheese fries with green onions and sweet potato fries with spicy mayo. My go to drink is the double fina margarita, which they have on tap. Just to warn you, it's strong but tasty!! We were tempted to order a boozy shake for an after dinner treat, but were beyond stuffed from the amazing food we just ate.  Even the next day my friends were raving about the \"fancy burgers\" and the cheese curds! Check them out on a Monday for $5 burgers, or for their bottomless mimosa brunch on Saturday and Sundays--you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"Stopped in Sunday for Brunch and left full with a healthy alcohol induced glow so mission accomplished.  Probably the best value out there are the $10 bottomless mimosas.  My brunch date went with that option as I went to the Build your Own Bloody Mary Bar.  Other than the kitchen sink, DLUX has every ingredient you could possibly want to throw in a glass. We both went with breakfast sandwiches and split a side of potatoes that came slathered with a scallion and cheese sauce.  While she wasn't as much of a fan of the potatoes, I thought they paired nicely with the sandwich and didn't hesitate to eat them all.  I don't know if this would be my go-to brunch place but it definitely has an appeal. A solid choice."}
{"text":"Apparently publicity is more important than their customer base."}
{"text":"Flavors are okay, service isn't great. I've had 2 decent service days and 3 horrible. Can't recommend the place anymore.   Ask for less sauce on everything or it will be soggy, less cheese, less syrup, less dressing, dressing on the side. Less truffle oil on fries. I wish they knew how to properly dress things but they don't.   It seems the cooks weren't taught how much flavor to add, they just know which seasons to use. (no chef would add so much dressing) I'm referring to the soggy buns, soup like salads, and the disgustingly soggy fries.  The place would be good if there wasn't so much sauce, dressing, oil, cheese, mix in the smoothies, if it flavors the item there is too much and ask for less!!  If you eat seasoning packets straight up with no food this is the place for you!!!"}
{"text":"Let me preface: I am a fan of burgers with wacky crap on them.  Sure, there are places I go when I am seeking the sort of \"pure, holy\" cheeseburger experience (sorry Wisconsinites who will never see a Dick's Drive-In), but mostly, I want cheeseburgers with weird toppings.  To me, that is what the cheeseburger is about: creativity.  And DLUX is doing creative cheeseburgers like nobody else I know of in Wisconsin, and better than even some of my favorites in Seattle.  FH and I came here during a relatively slow time between lunch and dinner (around 2:00pm-ish on a Thursday).  We were greeted warmly and attended to promptly.  I got one of the grapefruit-lime homemade sodas and the FH got a red velvet milkshake based on the waiter's recommendation.  The soda was tasty, but probably my least favorite aspect of the meal, as the grapefruit flavor was much weaker than I expected.  Milkshake was phenom, and pretty much tasted like liquified cake and ice cream.  But the burgers.  The Burgers.  The.  BURGERS.  FH got the Pimento Cheeseburger, with perfectly cooked crisp bacon and wonderful homemade pimento cheese, creating a flavorful, playful take on the classic cheeseburger.  For me, however, their September burger of the month, a pear-and-brie concoction with bacon-pear marmalade was one of the best burgers I have ever had.  Gooey, melty brie and fresh, fruity pears blended perfectly with their well-seasoned beef patty and fluffy-yet-sturdy bun that managed to hold together under some pretty runny conditions.  I am tearing up a bit just thinking about it.  The flavors worked so exceptionally well together; whoever came up with that one deserves a medal.  As a caveat, the patties are cooked on the medium-well side, but I did not find them overdone or dry at all.  However, for those who like a pinker burger, you may have to make a request otherwise.  And the fries!  The thick, perfectly cooked fries would have been enough by themselves, but we got them in blue cheese/bacon and sharp cheddar/green onion varieties.  I thought they would just be sprinkled with toppings, but, as it turns out, these fries are covered in cheese sauce.  Creamy, delicious cheese sauce + amazing toppings = true french fry love.  They also layer the fries with the sauces and toppings just enough so that you don't end up with too many naked fries, which I thought was a nice touch.  Oh, and for the whole thing, we paid just over $30 before tip.  Are you serious?!  DLUX, you make me wish I still lived in Madison again, just a little bit."}
{"text":"Botttomless Mimosas? I'm there! $10, and I drank around 5, and I wanted to go for more. Well worth the cost.  I had the fried pickles, sweet potato fries with spicy mayo, and finally the margherita chicken burger. Fried pickles and sweet potato fries were delicious, and I couldn't stop going back for more. The fries were hot and crispy, and the fried pickles were fried just enough that the pickles were tangy and crunchy. Can't say the same for the chicken burger. I took out the mozzarella cheese, and the burger was just plain and pretty dry. It tasted like a normal chicken burger, which I won't complain about, but it wasn't anything special. My friend didn't enjoy her falafel burger either, which makes me wonder if I'd enjoy another entree. But I would go again if it meant sitting back with mimosas and more sweet potato fries.  I'm looking forward to repeating this experience (without the burger)."}
{"text":"Absolutely love the food!  Great variety of diverse flavored burgers.  Truffle fries are great.  Milkshakes...yum!  Priced well.  Always my go to place for burgers."}
{"text":"I tried out DLUX after reading a few fantastic reviews, and now I get to add to them! Loooove this place. I'll get my downsides out of the way so I can get to the good stuff: 1. Our server, Eric, was very casual--he said things like \"Still chowin' then?\" and \"Yeah, for sure man.\" I thought it was kind of nice and different to have a server that wasn't overly polite, but this might not appeal to everyone.  2. This is probably very old-lady-ish of me, but they turned the lights waaay down shortly after we got there, at about 6:30, and I wish they'd kept things a little brighter.  Anyway, on to the list of why I love DLUX: 1. Homemade, all-natural, strawberry-ginger soda. DONE.  2. My DLUX burger was delicious! They cook all their burgers to the same juicy perfection, and the arugula/blue cheese/port wine-onion marmalade combination was unexpectedly good. Perfect portion size, too. My boyfriend summed this up well: \"You know, sometimes I don't like burgers that aren't huge. Except when they're this good.\"  3. The fries! Oh lord, the fries. I had sweet potato with sriracha mayo, and I loved the sweet/spicy balance. Boyfriend got the blue cheese & bacon fries, which were really rich and tasty.  4. The price. Every burger is EIGHT dollars?! Yes please. I know it gets a little pricier if you add on sides, drinks, and the like, but I'd say this place is WAY worth it. For a few extra bucks over what you'd pay at a more casual burger place, you get delicious, well-portioned food, and a great atmosphere.  Now I just have to plan my next trip to try the shakes..."}
{"text":"Madison is my favorite food town, and I've eaten a lot of places, but this place is my all time favorite. The fries are amazing: the truffle Parmesan are to DIE FOR. Their burgers switch every once and awhile which is nice for variety. Make sure to get booze in your milkshake!"}
{"text":"Dlux was awesome! Highly recommend this brunch location for anyone. Good was delicious and our server, Allison, was attentive and helpful!"}
{"text":"I've been several times when in town for Ironman. Every time has been great. Great atmosphere, great food, great service! Fried cheese curds NO WAY I'm here without getting some, and these are as good as I've had.  Burgers have always been delicious and I don't eat burgers much. Kooky concoctions but don't worry they've got your standard.  Top it off with a crazy shake flavor like Toasted Marshmallow and I'm stuffed! Price is a tick high but I'm old and what they're selling you can't put a good price on. And that's good food and fun."}
{"text":"Parmesan Truffle Fries were amazing. The burgers are great and affordable. Overall pretty good spot to grab a bite on the square."}
{"text":"Food Is still great. I recommend the backyard bbq burger or the fried pickles. Get some sriracha aioli, too.   NO MORE 2-4-1s! They have stopped offering this deal. They made no announcement about it and I was so sad and disappointed the first time I came in after they had changed it. This is disappointing, but also seems to keep the number of college kids at bay.   $5 burger Mondays are amazing and definitely worth checking out."}
{"text":"Great burger place. I really like their black bean burger, which I had last time. This time I had their salmon burger. I thought it was good, not great. The salmon patty was cooked well; I just thought the sandwich could use a bit more flavor. (Maybe a little lemon?) The Parmesan truffle fries are heavenly.   Solid, friendly service. We waited an hour and a half for 6 people on a Friday night, which is to be expected in the downtown area."}
{"text":"Dined at DLUX on a recommendation from my mother, was not disappointed. Only a short walk from our stay at the Madison Concourse hotel.  The menu isn't huge, but is very adequate.  Everything on it is pretty affordable, with gourmet burgers being the main option at only $8. They don't allow a lot of changes to the burgers, but they're so good you won't care. Be sure to snag some sweet potato fries, they're some of the best I've had (and they give you the perfect amount).  If you're feeling sweet, snag a Red Velvet Shake, or a Krambach beer. Both went amazing with my Mushroom and Swiss.  The atmosphere is great too, very modern. Everything just seems new and fresh.  The draft beer prices are reasonable, but Miller Lite and similar brands run high at $4.  Honestly that's my only complaint.  Service was polite and fast. I'll definitely dine here again."}
{"text":"We had dinner here on a Sunday night. Good vegetarian burgers, like the fries too. Was pretty quiet, nice atmosphere."}
{"text":"Are you an undergrad? Then 5 Yelp stars, bro!! Bro, seriously. $10 all-you-can drink OJ & champagne!!! Hell yeah cocktails on tap, like they're beer! Plus, they're so sweet, it doesn't even taste like you're drinking alcohol LOL. But don't even bother with those cause we're ALL getting refills on our mimosas poured out of silver pitchers. We can get EVERYONE in a booth & then split the check 8 ways. Selfie cause we're so fng fancy right now. OMG load that flute up again, son, cause it's bottomless.  Now, are you 5 years into your mortgage just trying escape the worst for a moment before you have to go back to work on Monday but you can't taste the life-giving whiskey in this whiskey smash because all you taste is sugar and ice and how can they get 8 people in a booth comfortably when 6 of us with real adult anatomic proportions and not adolescent Bieber abs have to sit with one cheek off the seat and STOP TOUCHING MY LEG! No, I don't want to make my own Bloody Mary, I can do that at home. Wait, you won't let me get a delicious milkshake because I can barely button these shorts that fit fine last year, but you can get one?! Can I taste it? Oh god it's so good and tastes just like a campfire marshmallow. Hey, this spicy breakfast sandwich isn't half bad. Your burger isn't that good? Then let's get a bottomless mimosa to wash the bad taste out of our mouths and ultimately our souls. Wooohoooo!  3 stars."}
{"text":"Loved our first meal here.  Great atmosphere, good bar, friendly and capable service.  The burger was good and the curds were to die for - a definite contender for best in town.  Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Dlux is a great place when you want to feel fancy and eat fancy, but also want to indulge your inner 5 year old.  By that I mean, when you were 5, a classy meal was a happy meal with Strawberry Fanta. As an adult at Dlux, that means truffle fries, the farmhouse burger, and blackberry sage soda. See what I mean?  It's accessible classy. There's something for everyone."}
{"text":"Great twist on burgers. Delicious milkshakes. Boring weak drinks. Still like it better than ocean grill."}
{"text":"My mom came to visit from NY and we ended up going to DLUX 3 times in a week! She, and I loved it! We live 3 blocks away, so it's easy, convenient to get to, and SOOOO GOOD! I also love how nice the staff is, and how accepting they are of allowing us to bring our dogs to the outdoor patio dining area. Their cocktails are great, the food is always great, and the red velvet shake is amazing!!  We will be back a million times :)"}
{"text":"Dlux is amazing. Super close to the capital. Very good food and amazing drinks (esp old fashioned). This place gets busy quick but sitting at the bar is perfect. I highly recommend going here if ever in madison."}
{"text":"Wow. This place is great! Such a fun and funky atmosphere with delicious food and shakes!"}
{"text":"I've never had an actual beef burger at DLUX despite going many times over the years due to their only-cooked-to-one-temperature policy (I like my burgers well-done), but I'm still a fan. Their chicken burgers aren't my thing either, but I've found a lot of happiness in their veg offerings. My latest favorite is their Falafel Burger - a falafel patty topped with greens, tomato, cucumber, tzatziki, and a super delicious spicy garlic sauce. Put that on everything, please! Real suggestion: use it on the fries. I'm going to ask for that next time. Anyway, back to the burger - it's a super great flavor profile, but the texture is largely just soft. The cucumber slices were razor thin - piling on a couple more would do the sandwich a huge solid.   My dining companion on my most recent visit had the Asian Noodle salad, and it looked amazing. I don't offer order salads when out because it is one of the few things I can actually make just as well as most restaurants, but this was a contender.   Any of their fry choices are solid, and are great for sharing due to their rich toppings. Give the housemade strawberry & ginger soda a try.   Another thing that I highly recommend is coming in for a shake. I have it on good authority that to make them the crafter literally shoves a piece of cake or pie or whatever flavor-maker into the blender along with the ice cream. They are not messing around. I haven't had a chance to try the peanut butter pretzel yet, but it's next on my list."}
{"text":"Had the Backyard BBQ burger which was not too bad. The highlights were the Chocolate Peanut Butter Pretzel shake with the Bleu Cheese and Bacon fries. Salty, sweet, cheezy and BACON! What more do you need?"}
{"text":"Average. Place looks nice but they seem to charge a bit more and I assume it is the decor. Probably would visit again but not to often. $15-$20 a person for lunch is a bit pricy to me for a burger, fries and a soda."}
{"text":"Outstanding place for lunch or dinner. Have had several burgers and sides and have been impressed every time. The cocktails on tap are fantastic and and change on a seasonal basis. Always something worth h your while- will definitely visit again soon!"}
{"text":"Executive summary: I came here for the alcoholic milkshakes.  Mine was divine.  I'll need to return and update my review because I never looked at or sampled from the food menu, never visited the restrooms, none of that important yelp-ful stuff.  This trip was all about the milkshake.  I don't know about the boys but it brought this gal to the yard!  DLUX's interior is modern.  There's trendy art and mirrors on the wall, a central, square bar, and tables and  booths along the outside walls  They offer several milkshake options made with Sassy Cow Ice Cream.  YUM.  You can add booze to any of them.  Also, YUM.  I had the salted caramel pecan with bourbon.  Toasted marshmallow, chocolate peanut butter pretzel, and vanilla coconut are on my list for future visits.   They used to validate for parking for the lot under the building but I no longer see that listed on their website, perhaps times have changed.  Still, there are several ramps nearby and depending on the day and time of your visit you might find street parking as well.  I've been lucky enough to find street parking a few times when I visit this general area of downtown."}
{"text":"Came on St. Patty's Day weekend brunch. Waited 30 minutes for a table (was told 1.5hr, whooooop). Service was great. Robin is a sweetheart. Ordered their bottomless mimosas and a sunrise burger. I ended up drinking the equivalent of 3.5 mimosas, so they're well worth the price. The sunrise burger is amazzzzzing. The hash brown and jelly mix well with a chicken patty. Had a little mishap with my first burger, hence the 4 stars. Will definitely return though."}
{"text":"I'll admit it: I had my reservations (snobbish as they may have been) about this place before I went for brunch today. I have not had a proper burger there, but the meal I had this morning was outstanding.  The DIY bloody mary bar is terrific and must be a bartender's bestest friend. My companions also enjoyed the bottomless Mimosa (dangerous at only $10).  The doughnuts are perfection and the strawberry cream cheese glaze on the side is just ridiculous. I wanted to drink a glass of it.  The breakfast sandwiches are nothing fancy, they are just awesome sausage and egg sandwiches on soft rolls. It is the sides of potatoes and the four sauces offered (Cheddar/Green Onion, Blue Cheese/Bacon, Parmesan/Truffle, and Sriracha Aioli) that make a really good breakfast sammy an over-the-top, nap-inducing feast of gluttony.  LOVED BRUNCH."}
{"text":"Walking by, I see a sign that says they have milk shakes.  Sure, it's a cold-ish day in October, but I am so much a fan of milk shakes, and these are nice and thick, made with local ice cream, and deeee-licious.  Next time I'll ask them to skip the whipped cream on top.  I only had a black raspberry milk shake --only $5! -- and it was great.  So maybe this review is limited.   Deal with it."}
{"text":"Not enough seating for the high traffic the delicious food brings in. Reasonable pricing. Good specials, typically good service. $5 burger mondays and happy hour are two great deals. Closes for private events more than most places which can lead to disappointment. Great place for birthdays. Don't take reservations but really should."}
{"text":"Where in the world do you get high quality, yummy burgers for 8 bucks? Top notch cocktails under 8 bucks. I was visiting a friend in Madison who had been to Dlux a couple times. I loved the ambiance and from my experience in Chicago- a place this well kept means a little over average prices. But I was happily surprised, we had 5 cocktails, one veggie(amazingly delicious)burger and a chicken salad under 50 bucks. Loved the service, food and drinks.  Oh, with all the cool bars around this place, you can have one heck of a date night. ;)"}
{"text":"Great bloody marys. Food is good too, especially brunch. Falafel and burgers are solid."}
{"text":"Here's the greaetest thing: fries ~ nope. They're good just not my greatest thing.  The gyro burger, salad, options, shakes ~ nope. nope and nope.   The *GREATEST* thing for me & I suspect for them too: THE SERVICE.   No! Not the table service, bar service, even the kitchen which I appreciate their efforts but any place that have servers that not only ask, \"how are things?\" but get a response then take an unsolicited action.... MY MY MY these are the people to have in your pocket.   What do I mean? It's like someone asking, \"How are you?\" and they really don't mean it. How are you able to tell they didn't mean to ask?  Answer: When they don't hang around for the real answer.  I'm guilty of it too when someone really answers the generic polite question of \"how are you\" but I catch myself and pay attention then follow up.   I officially *heart* these guys for the following reasons: 1) I took forever to write a review and wasn't going to until that whole scheduling thing stuck in my craw. Yet, I have always appreacited when businesses get involved on Yelp and respond to customers and seek an opportunity to develop and grow  - not all criticism is meant for negative use and abuse. I truly speak to encourage and improve and I welcome the same 2) Not just their involvement in YELP as I'm not an Ambassador of YELP but also my most recent quip was live and in action and I'm amazed at the response. I mean sincere, genuine response - not the let me pander to hear how great I am and think the world of myself. Nope~ I said my salad was ok. Actually, \"Meh. Ok\" and I was asked what could be done to make it better.  I said: nothing and expected no more as this is a business lunch and the convo was the real issue. Before I could walk out; I had an apology (totally not needed), I had a few questions thrown at me (I was rushing so I gave quick replies but said I'd call and give info) and I had a gift sake to take (I tried to give it back as \"it's totally not needed, I'll just stick to the burgers\"), Alex smiled and I said: I'm serious (about the burger only and call).   My call was appreciated as I could tell Alex was writing things done and had follow up questions. His voice poured with joy and excitement that I called back. Then it quivered with (yes, I just wrote quivered on a Yelp review) hope that I would return. At this point, I'm a fan for life.   I've said it repeatedly: I'M A SUCKER FOR SERVICE. I'll take your best service over great food anyday. For me, service let's me know the food will be good and makes everything taste better.   Beyond all that, the place is uber cute and now I really really want them to have the best level of success and become a Madison fixture.   I'm heading back for the last day run of the GYRO burger."}
{"text":"Wonderful food--service was great!! They've taken an American classic and boosted it a couple levels. You get value for your hard earned money. Best fried pickles ever--have the sweet potato fries with the siracha mayo. YUMMY!!!"}
{"text":"Easy peezy lemon squeezy: Every burger is 8 bucks. Pick the one you want and order it. The pimento cheese sauce on the pimento burger was so good I would like to spoon it. That's love right there, folks. Ditto for the sriracha mayo that comes with the crispy-to-perfection sweet potato fries. Condiment heaven. Spooning paradise. The burger itself was ok -- a little thin and too heavy on the salt with its seasoning -- but the fresh-baked bun, crispy bacon, fresh veggies and that pimento sauce, oh that sauce, save it like a good band saves a so-so singer. The strawberry ginger soda beat the valencia crush in the house-made soda challenge hosted by us, at our table. The burger joint in a swanky, former upscale venue feels ironic. I live for irony. Maybe that's why I give DLUX four spoons, errr, stars."}
{"text":"I have been to DLUX numerous times, a few times for dinner and a few times for brunch and in both large parties and small. Similar to most Madison restaurants, they don't take reservations for small parties and that inevitably leads you to 1 hour+ waits on the weekends. So if you're trying to go here on a weekend night it is best to go early or late to avoid the rush, same goes for brunch. This is a frustrating and pretty unanimous policy for all restaurants in Madison, so just be aware. The atmosphere itself of DLUX is very hip and modern, they keep the lighting low at night with a centrally located bar that is the focal point of the room. But during brunch the place lights up with so much natural light from the front wall of windows.  As for the food, everything I have had on the dinner menu has been on point in terms of taste and quantity. All of the \"Sorta burgers\" have a lot of different pieces to them that pull together a wonderful taste in every bite. I am huge fan of both falafel and black bean burgers, so if you're a vegetarian these are great options that are chalk full of flavor. I haven't had many of the burgers, but there are certainly a lot of choices that come loaded with toppings, so you really can't go wrong.   One thing that is slightly annoying is the way that the burgers and sorta burgers don't come with a side, realistically just the burger itself isn't going to fill me up so you're probably going to end up getting a side too. It would just be easier if DLUX automatically factored those into the items on the menu. But when you do decide to add on a side item, the sweet potato fries and sriracha mayo are 100% the best choice. The sweet potato fries are some of the best I have ever had (and that is saying a lot because I get them as much as I can) and the sriracha mayo adds so much flavor that you start to realize sweet potato fries should always come with this sauce.  On another note for dinner foods, if you're feeling like going a little healthier and choosing a salad, both the south by southwest and asian noodle salads have my stamp of approval. They give you huge portions so you'll most likely be able to take some home with you and they, too, combine so many ingredients that the taste is fantastic and you'll probably end up eating it all.   My real reason for not giving it five stars is the fact that I wasn't that impressed with their brunch. Yes they do have bottomless mimosas, something that isn't common in Madison, but their only options for food are breakfast sandwiches and potatoes. If you're going for the mimosas then this is definitely a great place to go because you will most certainly get your money's worth. But if you're looking for a delicious brunch place with lots of options like eggs benedict, breakfast burritos, or omelettes, as I usually am, DLUX falls a bit short."}
{"text":"Everything I had here was amazing!!! I started my evening out with a Whiskey Smash- absolutely delicious & sweet with enough alcohol :-) I followed up with a DLux Burger (port wine-onion marmalade, creamy blue cheese spread and arugula). It was absolutely delicious but a bit messy to eat. This is by far the best burger I've eaten in Madison. I enjoyed a Salted Caramel Pecan milkshake with my meal. The milkshake was heavenly. It was probably the best milkshake I've ever had.  To top everything off, the service was excellent!!!"}
{"text":"I'm updating my review for DLUX.  When I went at the end of August, I was a little peeved about their policies (they only cook burgers to one temperature-- medium well/well done-- and don't allow any substitutions).  I came home and wrote a long rant about the horrors of overcooked meat, among other things.  I just received a response from the Director of Hospitality at the Food Fight Restaurant Group, and it was truly impressive.  She really went above and beyond to answer all of my concerns.  I've written my share of bad reviews, but I've never gotten anything approaching this in response.  I'd still prefer a rare burger (and the risks that it entails), but the folks at Food Fight did a great job explaining why they've chosen not to offer that.  She also explained that it is, in fact, possible to make substitutions.  So here's the updated verdict:  This is a solid place.  They have extremely competitive prices for such a nice location.  The fries are very good (I tried both the cheddar/green onion combo and the truffle fries-- both were fantastic).  The shakes are simply out of this world-- I don't think I've ever tasted a better one. However, if, like me, you think that a great burger and a thoroughly cooked burger are mutually exclusive, you won't be thrilled with that aspect.  If, on the other hand, you tend to order your burgers medium well or well done, you'll have absolutely nothing to complain about.  Mostly, I'm impressed by how sensitive management was to my complaints.  I'm somewhat ambivalent about Food Fight restaurants in general-- they tend to have great interior design and menus, but sometimes fall a little short on execution-- but you certainly can't fault them when it comes to their professionalism.  I wish more restauranteurs were as committed to customer service and satisfaction as they are."}
{"text":"I like my burgers medium rare. Yes, I like it pink in the middle. Something about the possibility of getting e. coli really turns me on. And you know what? If you like your burger all dry and tasteless, that's cool. It's just not for me. Unfortunately, DLUX cooks their burgers to medium well, and that is a damn shame. I would like them a whole lot better if they would offer customers the choice of how long their burger is cooked, but they don't. Even putting Sriracha on my DLUX burger with its creamy blue cheese spread and onion marmalade didn't do it for me. It still tasted dry. I will say that the bun they used held up to all the condiments they put on there and didn't get soggy and fall apart. Props for that.  However, they do make up for a disappointing burger in other ways. Their salted caramel milkshake is solid, and the cheddar cheese and green onion fries are delicious. Womp womp on the burger though. 3.5 stars."}
{"text":"I'm happy to give DLux 5 stars.  I thought my husband and I would be waiting for hours to try out this new downtown restaurant on a Friday night, but it only ended up being about 30 minutes.  There is plenty of bar space available for waiting and it's such a great space so you don't mind hanging out for a bit and enjoying a cocktail.  Speaking of cocktails, I tried the 'Blackberry Fizz' and it was so deliciously perfect I half wondered if there was even any gin in the drink, but by the time I reached the end of my drink I determined there was - the flavors just melded together so beautifully.   I ordered the DLux burger, my husband the BBQ burger and we split the chips and sweet potato fries.  Everything was delicious - the flavors were perfect, the burger buns were just substantial enough, the fries were crispy, but soft; the chips were a little too crispy and could have used some more flavor.  Our service was excellent; very prompt and helpful.    We didn't try any of the shakes, but we'll definitely be back to give those a shot and sample some of the other burgers."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place because a good friend of mine was very excited to take me here but the experience was a bit... forgettable?  I enjoyed the decor and the atmosphere but the food and the service didn't really stand out to me. That's not to say DLUX is bad; simply just that I have very indifferent and mediocre opinions from my first visit."}
{"text":"I had one of the best burgers I have ever had in my life at DLUX.  It was called the Sunrise Burger.  A Perfectly Cooked Hamburger with a perfectly cooked fried egg, pepperjack cheese,housemade tomato jam, and shoes tring potatoes.  Everything in this burger tied together so well.  The tomatoe Jam added a touch of sweetness that really set the burger off.  They also have a variety of different types of french fries and shakes to go with your meal.  Put this place down on your list of places to try."}
{"text":"This review is about a year late, but this is where I tried by first bit of CHEESE CURDS. Even though I wasn't immediately impressed with the cheese curd (I grew to love them) the burger was delicious. This burger shop is in a cute little area close to the capital.   We went got downtown to look around, but much of the places were closed."}
{"text":"DLUX is our go to hot spot for brunch. The $12 bottemless mimosas is no joke. The waitresses don't mess around and are co Stanly filling up your glass. Their fruits bowls, potatoes, nachos.. Everything is amazing. Great people, great prices, great atmosphere. The outside deck in nice weather is perfect for people watching..bring your dog for the outside seating. They are happy to accommodate your pup."}
{"text":"The burger came out overdone and the fries were far too salty. The cheese spread on the burger reminded me of Velvetta. I came here hoping that this place would crack the Food Fight equation of bland food + being over-hyped + disgruntled staff (rightfully so)  Unfortunately it remains consistent with the Food Fight model. Boring drinks, bland+over-salted food, and a unfun time."}
{"text":"Absolutely love Dlux falafel burger. If you've ever eaten tuna or crab cakes, it reminds you a lot of the consistency and texture. It was fried to golden perfection and the hot sauce ( I asked for on the side) added the right amount of spice. Also, it served as a great dipping sauce for the fries which were crispy in their own right. Add the dill tzatziki, crunchy cucumbers and crisp lettuce, you have yourself a wonderful falafel. As someone who is not a vegetarian, I totally enjoyed my food. I would also recommend the mushroom/swiss burger. So juicy!  Considering I work 200 feet away, I will be making Dlux a frequence lunch joint."}
{"text":"Stopped here on a Saturday night for a nightcap.  This had a hotel bar feel but kind of felt like a bunch of teenagers were roaming around. The bartenders were noticeably young (not underage, just young). One bartender had his two friends there and they were sitting next to us at the bar - they were a little too comfortable, making it uncomfortable for us. But I digress.  We had heavy meals all day in Madison, so I was delighted to see $2 carolina styled coleslaw. It was not heavy at all, a good portion, and holy cow! $2!!  I also got a whiskey smash. Although I asked for easy syrup, still too sweet and I ended up having to add a bunch of water to balance it out. For $7, not bad but I probably won't be back."}
{"text":"The burgers were delicious! And reasonable. The place somehow doesn't seem to have grown into itself yet so the overall experience was lackluster."}
{"text":"As a self proclaimed burger connoisseur, I came to this restaurant with high expectations. As far as the restaurant itself it appears very classy and the service was excellent. I choose to sit at a elevated table facing the street which was a pleasant experience.  Now to the burger itself. I chose to order the spicy pepper burger with a side of fries. On appearance alone the burger look splendid with multiple toppings including grilled peppers and spicy cheese. It was slightly challenging to eat due to the size but the long to toothpick was helpful. After cutting the burger in half I noticed the patty itself was slightly overcooked and somewhat dry. Overall the meat itself was very chewy but somewhat flavorful.   The fries were excellent with a good amount of salt.  Overall the restaurant is very pleasant with excellent service and a modern atmosphere. As far as the burger, I have definitely had better and feel slightly letdown. Based on the reviews I will likely have to go back and try some of the other burger options that are available."}
{"text":"I had the green chili burger and it was fantastic! My husband had the sweet slaw burger and it was very good as well. I really liked the food."}
{"text":"If you cover a turd with sugar it tastes good till you swallow. That's dlux. The bartenders were on their phones the majority of the time and could care less about us being there. It was dead on a Saturday which is a sign within itself. Offering bogo on drinks means they can't keep up with others so my fault for trying it out. Fool me once, fuck you."}
{"text":"While visiting a friend in Madison, we hit up DLUX for burgers and drinks on a Saturday night. We waited about 20 minutes, but managed to snag a huge table to watch the Final Four in comfort. Good start to the evening!  While my other girlfriends ordered some amazing burgers, I uncharacteristically chose the Green Goddess salad with steak. We also shared sweet potato fries with siracha mayo and parmessan truffle fries - 3 stars but nice portions.   The salad was great - very filling, lots of fresh ingredients. The gals loved their burgers - a salmon creation, Asian-inspired choice, as well as a gluten-free friendly option. Good, original drink options too!  All in all a solid spot with good food and a fun atmosphere, and diehard Badgers fans who all fell silent at the buzzer when their beloved Bucky fell by 1 point.   What a shame..."}
{"text":"Dlux is my go to spot for burgers and brunch.  I love the creativity of the menu. The downtown location makes this the perfect spot to grab lunch after the farmer's market or dinner before a show at the comedy club.  Enjoying mimosas on the patio is a Sunday morning favorite!"}
{"text":"I've been to Dlux several times: three times for brunch, twice for dinner, and a few times just for drinks (love the 2-for-1 special on Friday nights). The staff is great and super friendly!  Brunch: Get here early or be flexible with maybe eating at the bar or counter because they get packed! Pretty sure they don't take reservations either. I love the unlimited mimosa special and it is mainly why I have yet to try the build-your-own Bloody Mary bar. I do wish they had more options for the brunch food menu though. I know this is a 'burger' place but not everyone is a huge fan of breakfast sandwiches (myself included). That's mostly why I'm giving it 4/5 stars, because I would love to see an omelette or Egg Benedict on the menu.  Dinner: Yum! The burgers are amazing. Also highly recommend trying a few of the french fry options - so far I've had the truffle cream and sweet potato/Sriracha mayo options. Both were great!"}
{"text":"The best place we ate when in town for Ironman Wisconsin! Super friendly service, quick food, TASTY at that, and all around great vibes. The cheese curds here are a must, as is the chocolate peanut butter pretzel milkshake (we shared this as a dessert). Everything we had here was superb, and we were stunned at how quickly everything came out for how great everything was! Definitely coming back when I'm here for Ironman Wisconsin next year."}
{"text":"Some of the weirdest service from a food fight joint. My date and I literally felt like we were being talked about and laughed at...for whatever reason.  Honestly I don't get it..? The burgers tasted odd, and not what you would think from a place that bills them as the best. My milkshake tasted like dishwasher soap and was simply gross!   Won't be back for half assed food and ODD BALL service."}
{"text":"I'm actually giving DLUX zero stars.    I have been to the restaurant a couple different times & each time the service was absolutely Terrible!  To almost feel ignored or as a ghost in a restaurant is ridiculous.  I have have worked in the service industry my whole life so I understand sometimes it's not a 5 star experience. But I would never recommend this restaurant. Awful service & the food is not worth bragging about."}
{"text":"4 star review is based on Burger Joint to Burger Joint comparison - Above Average. Gourmet/ Upscale Burger Stop #4 for this trip.   We stopped in on our way through town. Clearly the place is popular. Though I would say more for drinks than for food. It was pushing 8pm on a Friday and the place was packed. We were told 25-35min wait. We waited and were seated in under 10 minutes, point!  We had 3 adults in our party & ordered: toasted marshmallow shake (good, marshmallows over-toasted in the recipient's opinion), red velvet shake (very good & extra point, as it was comped even tho we didn't complain when they forgot to bring it out), spotted cow beer (good),  green goddess salad with chicken (very good), sunrise burger with chips (very good), backyard BBQ burger with carolina slaw (very good). Burgers were on brioche buns, adding richness.  Our tab was $43, which was rather reasonable for 3.  Menu is limited, but solid selections.  Waters were brought immediately and never ran dry. Checked back with after a few minutes and 2x after. Service was up to par, perhaps even a hair above considering how busy it was & our lack of attention seeking. Zero service complaints.  I wouldn't make this my regular dinner stop, but I would certainly come back."}
{"text":"I enjoyed a Sunday brunch with friends. The wait was 20 minutes, which was not nearly as bad as the. 1.5 hour wait at other places around the university. That's due to Freakfest and the morning after a Badger game.  The great: Bloody Mary bar. Mighty tasty with a varied selection of toppings- meats, cheese, and veggies!  Espresso shake with Bailey's- soooo good and smooth!!! Perfect blend of Sassy Cow ice cream and Bailey's. It's the perfect compromise between childhood and adulthood.  The good:  Sausage sandwich. Good flavor and a bit of kick.   The breakfast potatoes. Crunchy. My boyfriend got the truffle and Parmesan cheese ones. They were swimming in a truffle cream and were very tasty.   Okay:  Chicken fried chicken. The chicken was seasoned well, but there was not enough gravy on it. It was a pretty dry sandwich.  Service was good given how busy it was. I'm only visiting, so I can't tell you much about parking, other than that we parked farther away and walked here."}
{"text":"DLUX is the type of restauant every city needs. It's a burger joint that can satisfy everyone's tastebuds. They have sorta burgers (non-beef patties), vegetarian and a gluten free menu.   8 bucks a burger and 2.5 for small order of fries. It's really all you need and worth it especially when ordering a sorta burgers with a side of fries (I think). Sorta burgers have ingredients you don't normally find at any burger joint and they are delicious. Whitefish and shrimp with asian slaw, Portobello caprese, white bean with tortilla strips...it goes on. And select any of their fries, you'd be happy with whatever you get. My fave is the sweet potato fries with sriracha mayo. Oh man, now I'm craving it again!  Dlux is definitely one of my all time fave...been there a thousand times! http://www.getnmahbelly.com/2012/10/dlux-innovative-burgers-and-more/"}
{"text":"Hawaii 5-0 makes for a good tv show, and an even better cocktail! Be warned though, what tastes like a delicious, refreshing pineapple juice and fizzy water combo does actually contain a good amount of alcohol...so don't be fooled!  Anyhow, the real cherry on top of the proverbial sundae is the 2-for-1 deal from 11PM until close on Friday nights (and also Thursday and Saturday nights, according to their website)!! How DLUX even manages to stay in business with a deal this great eludes me, but I'm sure going to take advantage of it for as long as I possibly can!"}
{"text":"We came around 11 on Friday for drinks and food. The two-for-one drinks deal is AMAZING as are the drinks themselves! We got the sugar mama and the margarita. I personally enjoyed the sugar mama more just because I'm a huge fan of citrus-y drinks and St. Germaine.  We also got a large order of the parmesan and truffle cream fries and the buffalo chicken nachos. Honestly, we should've just gotten two orders of the fries because those were the highlight of the night. The buffalo chicken nachos were a larger portion than we thought it would be. It was just a little too vinegar-y and there wasn't enough blue cheese to offset that vinegar taste. Still good! But not really what we were in the mood for."}
{"text":"Clever burger options and the toasted marshmallow shake is dreamy."}
{"text":"Despite my disappointment on my initial visit, I really do like to give a new restaurant at least two chances.  A sample size of one is just not sufficient.  Luckily, a friend was taking me to lunch.  I had the Sunrise burger and the cheddar cheese & green onion fries.  The bun was actually better than I thought, but again the burger was just plain adequate.  I was really excited for the fires, but they were totally flat, a huge disappointment.  There was one saving grace, the coconut vanilla shake.  This shake was absolutely awesome.  The vanilla ice cream was sharp and flavorful, and they did not skimp on the quality coconut.  I will actually go back, but for one item only, this shake."}
{"text":"This is the only place in Madison I believe that offers bottomless mimosas, so come for that alone!  It's a big fad in NYC and Chicago, I wish they had it in more restaurants here.  The staff is pretty good about refilling the mimosas which is necessary.  Chicken and Waffle is AMAZING!  Good portion size too, not too heavy.  Everything here is!"}
{"text":"Happy hour from 3-630.  $2 off most drinks and appetizers.  Tried the Mac and cheese fritters.  Delicious, and very filling.  Moved on to the spicy Hawaiian chicken sandwich.  Also delicious.  The cheese fries were meh and was the only negative of the meal, but at that point I was so full from the amazing sandwich and appetizers."}
{"text":"Dlux is a good choice to end a walking tour of Madison's capital square. Happy hour is from 4ish to 6:30.  My Drink was a 5 star, hawaii five-o. My Burger was a good mushroom swiss with the dusty bun taking the starring roll. The fries were average with an excellent sauce. The best things I tried were the cheese curds, obviously Not frozen and spiced well, and thensample peanut butter and jelly milkshake. Bravo on that.  If their fries reach the quality of their sauce, Ill throw in that last star."}
{"text":"Fantastic service,  fabulous food.   We came in after 9 pm and got the best burgers.  I highly recommend the blue cheese and bacon fries!"}
{"text":"First visit here and while the service was great and prices reasonable, the burger fell flat. We split the DLUX and green chilie. The buns are too big/out of proportion.  Burgers we overdone for our liking (you cannot order to your preferred temp) and green chilie toppings were relatively  bland. Chips and onion dip were ok.  We won't purposely go back, but if friends want to go,  I'll try a shake and chicken sandwich. Fries also sounded good."}
{"text":"You must try a spiked milkshake. To die for. Sweet potato fries are phenomenal as well and wait staff is always prompt and friendly. A great place to try!!!"}
{"text":"The Green Goddess salad was AWESOME! I'm back home in NYC and going to try to replicate it for my lunches.   Atmosphere is great here. We got sat in huge booths the two times we went over Memorial Day Weekend, and loved the high ceilings.   Great service. We had alcohol, a salad and a burger one visit....and juice, two sausage breakfast sandwiches, and fries another visit. All was very fresh and delicious. Was really impressed with this place versus NYC places."}
{"text":"Overall this place was delicious and we will be returning to it on a regular basis.  Their draft menu is short with heavy IPAs  and only one stout (his favorite). The Margarita I got was small, but delicious.   Burgers were creative and delicious.  My only qualm was that it was overcooked. The waitress didn't even ask if we would like it to be cooked a certain way. Regardless, the burgers  were overall delicious.    My fiancee got the sweet potato fries with Sriracha mayo and I got the parma and truffle cream fries. Both were crispy, delicious and just perfect amount of sauce.   Lastly, we got a roasted marshmallow milkshake to go. It was amazing for a little dessert. Would highly recommend.   Service was great!   Like I said,  plan to return again on a regular basis. Delicious!"}
{"text":"Dlux is a great place to go for both brunch and dinner. For brunch, the bottomless mimosas are definitely worth it because they are delicious and easy to drink. Although I am not a huge fan of bloody marys, the friend that I was with did the Bloody Mary bar and when I took a sip i surprisingly liked it! Definitely get the spicy vodka when you get the bloody because it adds such a nice kick. Our server was very nice and made sure we got our share of bottomless mimosas!  The cheese curds here are one of my favorites in Madison. They literally melt in your mouth and the dip that you get goes great with them. The Dlux burger has a delicious red wine sauce that pairs so well with the blue cheese on it. As a burger place however, I just wish you didn't have to pay extra to get a side."}
{"text":"Fun spot for brunch with Bloody Mary Bar, ( once was enough) as it's quit filling with artichoke hearts, blue cheese stuffed olives, cheese, cucumbers, beef jerky, etc. I nicknamed it a salad bar in a glass. Others enjoyed bottomless Mimosa for $10.00. Great burgers ( including Salmon with ginger, wasabi, that you can get a gluten free bun with for a nominal fee. We each had a different burger that all enjoyed. Previous reviews stated all the burgers were done medium, so I envisioned a dry burger, but they were juicy, yummy. The regular fries with blue cheese were good, but not great according to my hubby who likes them crispy, and they were not cooked long enough for his liking. My sweet potato fries were done just right, and when I asked for catsup, no problem. Wait staff is attentive. Next time I may try a salad as they looked very healthy. We'll return. Thank you."}
{"text":"I loved everything about this place.  It's definitely my new 'go-to' spot downtown.   I'm still thinking about the salmon sandwich and the blue cheese & bacon fries.   Great atmosphere----they manage to nail that \"trendy and fun but still warm and inviting' thing. Bright with lots of windows and a fun view outside. Can't wait to go back and check out the patio!"}
{"text":"I was super excited to check out DLUX on our trip to Madison, especially when I heard about the Boozie milkshakes. We went on a rainy Friday night and surprisingly there was no wait.   There were four of us and each ordered a different boozie shake. I went with the Red Velvet shake mixed with bourbon. I would stay far away from that shake if I went back. By the time I was halfway done it was like I was trying to suck soggy red velvet cake through the straw. It had a pretty gross consistency and was definitely not what I was expecting.  Fortunately the main meal was better than the shake. I went with the Porky's Revenge burger with a side of Blue Cheese and Bacon fries. The burger was cooked well and just overall tasted good. It definitely wasn't the best burger I have ever had but I don't have anything negative to say about it. The fries were delicious, highly recommend!  It feels harsh giving three stars for this but the milkshake really killed the meal for me. Everyone else in my party enjoyed their shakes a bit more though so stay away from the Red Velvet and you should be okay!"}
{"text":"Traveling from Chicago and came to this place for brunch. Great food, bottomless mimosas for $12. Tori is the best server!! Sit in her section if you can!!"}
{"text":"I went to this restaurant looking for a new Sunday brunch spot. I went here alone and was greeted by a waitress who said I could sit at a spot by the window since I was alone. She sat me down and did not check on me for another 15-20 minutes (I wasn't even given a water). I went up the bar and was rudely told someone would be by me when they had time. I ended up staying here for quite awhile. I ordered a bacon egg sandwich which tasted average along with a side of fruit. I probably won't be going back here."}
{"text":"This is my favorite burger spot in Wisconsin. All their burgers are delicious and consistently well made. The fries they offer are really delicious as well. On weekends they have bottomless mimosas during brunch!   This place tends to get busy on weekends, which is standard. Service is super quick and efficient and they keep your glass full!  Highly recommend the cheese curds here, yim yum!"}
{"text":"Great drinks, nice ambiance, decent food, and amazing service! I'm a fan.  The decor was cute and the music was good. The bf and I went for dinner and drinks. There was a ~30-45min wait for a table, so we sat at the bar and got a drink each. The drinks were both stellar, and the bartender was very nice and helpful. I was debating between two drinks, and she gave me a sample of one to help me make my decision! Pretty awesome in my book.  We were seated about 20-25min after getting there, in one of the cozy booths. We ordered a burger each and a small fries each (sweet potato with sriracha mayo and the parmesan with truffle cream sauce). The waiter was very accommodating, as we changed our fries order about 5 minutes after ordering our food.   The food was decent. The menu gave me the impression that the focus was more the toppings and flavors than the meat itself, but the burgers were the opposite. They could have benefited from less salt in the meat and less butter on the buns, and though they say medium well is what they do, I really think they would've been tastier if the meat was done medium to add a little moisture.   Fries were good. I highly recommend the sweet potato fries with sriracha mayo, but the parmesan with truffle cream sauce were a little too heavy for fries. I think I would prefer if the fries (or at least regular fries) were included in the price of the burger, and you could pay $1 to upgrade to a different fries or side dish option.  The only weird thing we witnessed (and heard) was one of the waiters vacuuming the carpet just 2 tables away for a good few minutes. Nothing had spilled, just vacuuming the crumbs that inevitably end up on restaurant floors. That probably could have waited till after the place closed. Keep in mind that this was at 7pm or so.   We thought the food was a bit overpriced, even for the \"fancy\" style of burger and nice cocktails. $40 for burgers, fries, and drinks for 2 people seems a bit much. Definitely worth a try, especially for those delicious cocktails (need to come back for happy hour soon!). If they tone down the salt in the burgers and consider including fries with the burger order, I would easily give this place 5 stars."}
{"text":"I thought DLUX was great! We came here on a Friday night around 6, assuming that it would be really crowded and we were right. It's a small space but the staff usually gets people in and out in a good time. Also if there's open seats at the bar, those are fair game-which is what we ended up doing.   I had the Sugar Mama Cocktail to start and my fiance had a Spotted Cow. My drink was pretty strong but still amazing! For dinner, I had the Farmhouse Burger (without the bun haha) and I loved it. DLUX is pretty simple in terms of their burgers, it's nothing too extravagant or over the top, and the menu is only one page which I don't mind.   I plan on returning!"}
{"text":"Overrated.   Small, overcooked burgers with supposedly creative toppings, and the boozy milkshake gimmick mostly results in a thin, runny milkshake.   The crowd when I went consisted mostly of middle aged types trying to look cool with over done hair and one too many buttons undone on the fanciest shirt they could find at Kohl's.   If you want a burger and a shake, you're better off going to Culver's.  No thank you whatsoever."}
{"text":"A very rousing atmosphere that makes intimate conversation challenging but DLUX is the place to be if you're looking for specialty burgers supported by modernized \"classics\" and milkshakes.  As side notes, the buffalo chicken nachos are light on chicken and buffalo and interestingly, served on home made potato chips, not tortilla chips. For a sober diner it was a little off-putting but once I had 3 drinks in me I could see the potential appeal.   If you order the cheese curds, take note that you only get 10 so plan accordingly. Do yourself a favor and order the sweet potato fries with sriracha mayo--star of the night.   The Standard and Black and Blue burgers fired on all cylinders. The Colonel Strosin fried chicken sandwich was a little dry but still decent.  And there's a nice little 2-for-1 craft drink list for late night patrons til midnight."}
{"text":"Have been three or four times and it's always great. Their mixed drinks are really good and I love the truffle fries. Only complaint is that the wait can get pretty long (especially for parties of 6+) and there is often no space at the bar to wait. Maybe they need a bigger space."}
{"text":"Im at odd about this place. Ive had good appetizers and cocktails here but I cannot forgive the fast that they do not cook their burgers anything but well done. In this age of stellar burgers they are fighting common sense and good taste. Their milkshakes are delicious and worth stopping in for.  I have been back but never to get a burger. Its a good place to grab a drink on a night out or to take a date."}
{"text":"The meat is only cooked one way for an $8.50 burger. The menu doesn't have many opinions. The service was great but I didn't get the modern style bar with a poor menu and not so good food."}
{"text":"My husband and I enjoyed our recent dinner.  It's an adult burger joint with a bar and cool décor.  The staff was very friendly and accommodating.  Our bartender did a great job meeting my request to make my drink, the \"Sugar Mama,\" even sweeter.  My husband tried one of their housemade sodas and it was very good.  Would get both beverages again.  We LOVED the French Onion Dip.  Crispy housemade chips with housemade French onion dip.  LOTS of onions but oh, so delish!   My husband tried the Backyard BBQ burger and I had the Farmhouse.  Both were very good but the burger patties themselves lacked full flavor (think the Graze burger for those of you who've had the pleasure and joy).    The highlight were the shakes.  OMG, I have no words!  Simply scrumptious and nothing matches them.  We tried the Vanilla Coconut and Toasted Marshmallow.  We both agreed the burgers alone would not bring us back (too many wonderful burgers elsewhere) BUT the beverages and French Onion Dip were definitely a draw."}
{"text":"Wow, DLux not only has good burgers, but they also serve up a mean brunch!  Bloody Mary bar with accoutrements galore...bacon, pepperoni, blue cheese stuffed olive, cheese, sausage, artichoke, green beans, and the list goes on. And $10 bottomless mimosas. What a deal!   The breakfast sandwiches are delicious and incorporate the same unique toppings as the burgers (such as sriracha mayo and apple butter). Order potatoes to share with one of the yummy sauces (truffle what???). I already plan to go back with a group of friends next Sunday!"}
{"text":"The food was good -- The clientele was horrible! There was a $13 bottomless mimosa deal going on so there was puke in the men's and women's bathroom. People were getting kicked out for breaking glass wear and having altercations with the bartenders and wait staff. The people at the bar were loud and chanting. Just real drunk. It was hard to enjoy anything about this place."}
{"text":"Good place! Nice location! Fun atmosphere!   Awesome kegged cocktails, LOVE LOVE the bottomless mimosas at brunch, and their Parmesan Truffle & Cream Fries are to die for!   They do have some salads, but this is a sandwich and sides kinda place - even at brunch. Especially at brunch. Don't go here if you are looking for a light meal."}
{"text":"Great burger spot! I had the black bean burger as a substitute and was not disappointed. The chips were well seasoned and fresh as well. Finally, I topped it off with a red velvet shake which was amazing! Would definitely recommend this place! Only catch is if you are going on a weekend or busy week night is to get there early as seating is limited"}
{"text":"Blue cheese and bacon fries were nicely crisp, but the blue cheese sauce under the crumbles of blue cheese and bacon bits was too mild to add much flavor.  The lemongrass lemonade was disappointing - I was expecting more lemonade and less lemongrass and got instead a lemongrass flavored soda with none of the tartness of lemon.  Service was friendly and quick."}
{"text":"Love the decor in this restaurant. The half circle booths are very cool and very comfortable. Our service was great and the drinks were delicious.   We arrived during happy hour so our cheese curds were $2 off. Which by the way we're absolutely positively delicious. These are the real deal cheese curds. You put one in your mouth and the cheese pulls. They were amazing. Great batter. I think I'm going in there again just for some curds and a milk shake.   Happy hour also consisted of $2 off my draft beer which made it only $3. What a deal?!?! My wife had a really good margarita and that too was $2 off. Really good drinks there.   I ordered the Sunrise burger. Ate every bit of it. It's not the biggest burger I've had but honestly it was just the perfect size. The bun was perfect. The egg with pepper jack and onion rings were a perfect match. There was a delicious sweet taste to the burger that I loved.   My wife had the Farmhouse burger with a fried green tomato. She ordered a small order of blue cheese and bacon fries. I had the Parmesan truffle fries. OMG! These are scrumptious.   For dessert we shared a coconut milkshake. Wow! Wow! What a treat. So tasty. We will be coming back. I can't rave enough about this restaurant. Love it!!!"}
{"text":"If you are in the mood for a burger and want some spicy options to break away from traditional American interpretations, this is a nice stop. Sweet potato fries with chipotle dressing are addictive. It's a bit upscale from most burger places as well. This would give  a higher rating if they had healthier options but I think that's more about my making a category mistake of looking for healthy food at a comfort-foodery."}
{"text":"If you like burgers & fries (um, who doesn't?!?), then you need to visit DLUX!  We went with a group of 4 & we all got different burgers. We all really enjoyed our burgers. But the real winner from this meal was the fries! DLUX has 4 kinds of specialty fries & we ordered a small order of each. Wow wow wow. The truffle fries were my absolute favorites!  Our friend was also celebrating his birthday & got to order a free birthday smoothie. He chose a PB + chocolate smoothie with some booze in it. He made the silly decision to share it with us & I think we drank more of it than he did.  DLUX is a winner for a casual dinner. One word of warning: this place is probably not good for a large group. It's kind of small & all of the tables were packed full when we went there."}
{"text":"Nothing like grabbing a great brunch before the farmers market. Warning, bottomless mimosa is delicious and dangerous. The Double Trouble was tasty and very filling. Shared a side of potatoes and both left incredibly full (and buzzed)..."}
{"text":"We went there for dinner the other night  after my husband saw they had a mention in Madison Magazine.  The place was pretty quiet (as to be expected for a Tuesday) and we were seated right away.  The atmosphere is decent- decor is modern and trendy- my only complaint was that we were seated in a corner and it was pretty dark- there were no lamps or candles or anything, so the space felt kind of cold and bland. Other parts of the restaurant seemed to have better lighting.  Our waiter was pretty attentive and our food came very quickly- we were actually surprised at how fast it was.  We ordered the Dlux burger and the Farmhouse burger and a large order of the fries with parmesan and a creamy truffle sauce.  I also had one of the house sodas (the strawberry and ginger one) and my husband had a beer. The food was very good. The Dlux burger was pretty messy to eat because it had a soft cheese on it, so it was pretty gooey, and the Farmhouse burger was also tasty.  The fried green tomato was an especially nice addition.  The fries were also very good, but needed to be eaten with a fork because they were fairly messy.  And the strawberry-ginger soda was tasty and refreshing, though next time I would order it with only a little ice- the way it was, it was mostly ice and very little soda, and what little soda there was got watered down very quickly.   Overall we thought the food was good and the prices were very reasonable.  The portions are not gigantic (which I like), but someone who is looking for a more hearty meal may want to order a side or two.  We were too full for dessert, but I am definitely interested in going back to try the Sassy Cow milkshakes. Also, note that they do validate parking if you park in the ramp around the corner from the restaurant."}
{"text":"Had the best experience here last night. Great music and atmosphere. Jake, our bartender was the best I've ever had! Very friendly and made great drinks. Would recommend this place to anyone"}
{"text":"I've been here so many times and it never disappoints me. Whether you eat anything, are vegetarian or need gluten free friendly options--DLUX can appeal to your needs. I've come a couple of times for dinner. You have the option to get any burger and swap out the beef with chicken or the veggie patty. The \"DLUX Burger\" is my go to with the black bean patty. The blue cheese really sticks out and makes it extra mouth watering.   Most of my visits are for brunch -- two words. Bottomless mimosas.  So affordable and so fun. Please treat your waitstaff well -- they're very generous with their mimosas and won't forget about coming to refill your glass! Brunch menus are a bit harder for me because I don't eat all meat (just seafood) or like eggs, but this most recent time I had their \"Green Goddess\" salad and it was delicious. The apple gives it a nice, tart crunch and the goat cheese makes it so creamy and savory. You have the option to add meat to it as well -- I added the salmon and it was cooked very well and made it feel more filling. This is definitely a place we bring our friends who visit from out of town!"}
{"text":"Came here about 3 or 4 times already since I lived in Madison. It's a little pricey, a small amount of cheese curds were $8! There was no more than 8  in the bowl. The only issues I had was the price and it was a little too loud when I was last ate there. I couldn't talk to my boyfriend nor could he hear me because of how loud it was. I love the music but it was too loud. Our waitress was ok, not the best."}
{"text":"A group of coworkers and I made a dinner stop here.  The drink menu and the food menu are playful and interesting.  We all had different drinks and we all liked our choices.  We all had a burger of some kind.  My mushroom and swiss was one of the best I've had.  I did miss the corn dip that had been on the menu when DLUX first opened.  I get menus change but that dip was so awesome.  My friends had no complaints either.  Some day I will try the brunch as I hear good things about that."}
{"text":"Maple and waffle shake? Ridiculous. Buffalo chicken nachos? Crazy. Cheese curds? Nearly perfect. Burger? It had a fried green tomato on it. And it rocked.  Anyway, you could say I enjoyed my most recent visit. Just a little."}
{"text":"Well someone has to say it, DLUX is DLICIOUS!   The menu is not extensive by any means-but from what I can tell, what they do, they do well.  We ordered the parmesan fries, sweet potato fries, backyard bbq burger and the green goddess salad.  Everything was excellent.  The parmesan fries didn't get finished but every other plate was licked clean!  The bbq burger had the perfect amount of bbq sauce, the sweet potato fries were nice and crispy and the salad had the best honey cilantro dressing.  I can't wait to come back for a boozy brunch with bottomless mimosas."}
{"text":"Great place to enjoy a birthday dinner!  We happened to show up during happy hour, which ended at 6:30, so we had discounts on tap beers.  This was a bonus as well as a free shake for the birthday boy/man.  Everybody tried a different burger and fries/sides were ala carte.  This worked out well as that allowed us to order some appetizers, and then we didn't have a ton of left overs.  Great burgers, country burger was delicious as we'll as the burger special of the night.  Definitely worthwhile for a gathering place for dinner with friends.  We shall return!"}
{"text":"Good solid burger place. Lots of selection and good service. Outdoor patio is especially good - great view of the capital in a relaxed setting.   Try the DLUX burger with blue cheese and arugula. I had the chk patty since they didn't guarantee grass fed beef. My son had the \"standard \" and he really liked it (of the kid finishes all of it you know it's good). Then my wife had the salmon burger and she really enjoyed    Again...service, setting is great. Food is good but nothing special either."}
{"text":"I have a confession: this is my second version of this review. I sat down and wanted to write a mediocre review. I wanted to play on the lack of Es in DLUX, how your Expectations went away along with them, and how SMPL might be more fit.  But you know what? The longer I tried to write it, and reflected on my dining experiences, the harder it became. The truth is, these are good, quickly prepared, /mostly/ simple burgers. They're made and served by genuinely attentive and friendly people. I'm positive you'll have a good-to-great experience when you go. It's one of the better ways to transform $8 into something tasty.  I'm looking forward to where DLUX will go from their pretty exciting beginning. There are good ideas in the heads of the people running the show. They've already completed a fantastic transformation of the former Ocean Grill space, and if they keep their topping offerings fresh (and maybe figure out how their kitchen can support heftier burgers with a range of temperatures), I can see DLUX becoming a lasting member of the Square. --- For a burger, I'd suggest the signature DLUX (you can't ruin a caramelized onion) or the Backyard BBQ. The blue cheese and bacon fries are excellent, as are the sweet potato fries with a side of sriracha mayo. I really want to love the Parmesan and truffle cream fries, but the current presentation is more reminiscent of poutine, which results in tragically uneven application of thick cream sauce (and the truffle oil contained therein). I'll certainly be checking out if there are any unwritten rules applied to the fry section next time.   At this point, you've reached the best part of your meal: the time when you get to pick a milkshake! But why stop there? Why not make use of that nearby well-stocked bar and come up with a very special treat? Some combinations I can personally vouch: toasted marshmallow with Rumchata, or red velvet with peppermint schnapps."}
{"text":"I came in hearing that the burgers were gonna be great, maybe even deluxe! But when we left  we felt pretty underwhelmed. Lots of their flavors were masked by stronger ones on the burger, but that doesn't mean I didn't enjoy my blue cheese with port wine caramelized onions!  They also serve fries a la carte which was kind of a bummer. The server seemed sort of annoyed, but we did come in about 20 minutes before the kitchen closed. We also had tap beers at our table. but the seating wraps around the bar so we could see that the night life was lit."}
{"text":"I live down the street from DLUX and have been there a few times... and always had a great experience.  Every time I've gone it's always been incredibly busy, which I think is a good sign for any restaurant.  I am obsessed with the red velvet cake milkshake, so rich and tasty.  I've never ordered it with alcohol but now that I know it's an option I'll have to try it out :)  The Standard (sub chix) is my favorite sandwich on the menu!   The atmosphere is very beautiful and staff is really helpful! :)"}
{"text":"Food wasn't in the same category as the many other fabulous places I've eaten in Madison this week. Greasy, overly salty, generally not tasty. My two colleagues and I have loved so many restaurants in town, but this food left us all disappointed. Did not like the cheese curds, farmhouse burger, or berry/sage soda. Fries were good.   Very kind service, nice interior design. Might have been a better experience to just come for cocktails."}
{"text":"A friend and I went here two weeks after the Yelping Between the Buns event because we were really happy with the food at the event. Food still tasty, although there were some qualms with the service.  Beverages: Friend had the house made strawberry ginger soda, which has a light flavor with a bit of zip.  I had Salted Caramel Pecan shake with bailey's added.  We were a bit disappointed that they had no alcoholic shakes on the menu since we sampled them previously; I hope they add alcoholic shakes to the menu soon.  Spicy corn dip appetizer:  As others have said, this is really tasty. I probably never would have ordered this without prompting...but it goes really well with the dipping fritos (which are less spicy than the fritos I am used to).  Has a bit of sriracha on top for kick.  Burger: All burgers are cooked to one temperature, no pink, also no substitutions except for substituing beef burger with chicken or mushroom.  I had the DLUX burger, with arugula, blue cheese sauce, and onion marmalade. NOM. The onion marmalade is the key factor.  Fries: Fries are ordered separately in either a small or larger size.  We had the parmesan&truffle oil, which came with a bechamel parmesan sauce and truffle oil on the fries.  Very tasty, although hard to make sure each fry got some sauce...maybe a side of sauce would be nice too...?  Only downside was the service, which was friendly but failed to 2 key things. I think DLUX would benefit from staff to bus tables and refill water.  When our entrees were delivered, our appetizer plate was clearly empty, but they didn't clear the empty plate, which was odd.  I also ran out of water so I had to go to the bar to get a refill.    Overall, super tasty, would go back, also one of the few downtown places to have a full menu late night."}
{"text":"I have dined here three times since my first visit, and DLUX is consistently delicious. I have taken family and friends here now, and they all loved their experience! My favorite shake is the Chocolate Peanut Butter Pretzel, and I was happy to learn the shakes can be split or ordered in half sizes. I will continue recommending this restaurant to guests."}
{"text":"If you like salty food--this is the place to go!!  I love that they have a VISION and they stick to it from the food to the decor! The BF had to order two burgers to feel full and I would have too but the fries I ordered (I've had them before at a yelp event and they were MUCH better back then) left a salty taste in my mouth so I held off.  Food came out really quickly and we both loved our burgers:DLUX, White fish, and backyard BBQ! His fish burger was AMAZING and I wish I had ordered it, but I loved mine as well.   The Blue cheese and bacon fries have been delicious in the past but I didn't like them this time...I'll be back to try again though!!"}
{"text":"My wife, sister and I went to DLUX with the intent on having good burgers and fries.  We definitely got what we were looking for.  Our waiter was very honest, nice, had a good sense of humor, and was attentive.  Since we had never been there we asked his opinion on many of the burgers and fries to see what his favorites were.  He was very open in letting us know them and didn't just say everything on the menu is great.  The menu had some decently unique options that looked to be great combinations.  We decided to get 3 burgers and 3 orders of fries to share so we could all get a taste of the different things.  For burgers we got the DLUX burger, the Farmhouse, and the White fish and shrimp.  All were quite tasty but my favorite was the Farmhouse, \"monterey jack, fried green tomato, bacon and baby greens with a side of tomato jam\".  The tomato jam really brings it all together.  For fries we ordered blue cheese bacon, sharp cheddar green onion, and parmesan truffle cream.  These were all fantastic.  The cheese was layered perfectly and the amount of blue cheese was just right to not be overwhelming.  I couldn't pick a favorite of these, they were all awesome.  I founded the prices to be quite good for the quality of food and environment (around the capital, somewhat hip).  $8 per burger, $3 for a small order of fries.  We were seated immediately and the food came out promptly.  On top of everything we had our 2 month old baby too.  The restaurant wasn't too loud but had a nice constant level of noise (talking, music, misc) that kept her in a trance.  Overall I don't really have anything bad to say other than the young ladies that gave us a dirty look for having a baby when we walked in.  If I could I would give it a 4.5 just because I reserve 5 for things that rock my face off.  Very good place, would recommend to others.  Not really for families with children that would be loud and wanting to run around."}
{"text":"Wowza! Cool place - decor is different - upscale but not by too much if that makes sense. Interesting cocktails. We had a recommended appetizer by our server / corn relish with dip fritos. We then split a burger (because it was late) - burgers are a la carte $8 I believe but OMG simply the best burger I've had in a long time! It had some sort of pimento cheese,bacon, and pepper jelly....not totally sure what that is nor do I care because I can't stop thinking about how good that was! We were in Madison for 5 days and this was my favorite. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Forgettable experience here and almost didn't bother with a review, but I figured someone might find useful. Essentially came by for a last drink for the night after wandering State street and capital square as it was one of a handful of spot that seemed to be open still late on a Saturday...  PROS: -Cheap drinks, my whiskey smash only cost $7 -Our bartender/server was good. Promptly provided menus upon seating and quick to take our orders  CONS: -Whiskey smash was overly sweet, but can't complain too much as it was cheap af compared to what I'm used to paying in Chicago -Ambiance... Feels like corporate hotel bar, some weirdos/hobos wandering around entrance and eventually ran into one of them in the restroom -Overhearing the other bartender talking to the couple next to us (seemed like they were friends) about how wasted he got last night and how he was barely making it through his shift -Seemed like a younger college crowd all around and everyone seem to know someone working there and saying what up to a point where you just feel out of place  Anyways, not really my scene I guess or just not feeling the vibes here. If coming here for drinks, I'd pass and go elsewhere.  'Til next time.  187/365"}
{"text":"Honestly, very meh food overall. However they do have bottomless mimosas at brunch, which is a huge plus. Without that, this place would probably only have 2 stars...that being said, if that's what you're looking for and you know what you're getting into (ie drunk brunch), go for it!"}
{"text":"I have went two times this month since I found out the impossible burger was there! The plant based burger is amazing and I can't express how much I hope they decide to add it to the menu as a permanent item! Vegan aioli is amazing and the sweet potato to fries compliment  the burger perfectly!"}
{"text":"This place is great. Food is top notch and they have a fun brunch with bottomless mimosa's.   I tried the Porky's Revenge burger and it was delicious. Burger was cooked perfectly, and the pork belly was the perfect addition. The bun and toppings tied everything together.   We were there for brunch, so our table shared their homemade donuts. They are fresh and warm when you get them. They come with a fruit sauce that is awesome. I highly recommend."}
{"text":"Came here for weekend brunch, and the place was packed! Luckily, we found a few spots at the bar after waiting a bit. The chicken and waffles were very tasty, and the sweet potato fries were pretty good with the Sriracha sauce. My favorite was the Philly burger. Super tasty! This place is great for brunch and lunch!"}
{"text":"Great burger. Could be a bit larger, but what it lacked in size was made up for in flavor. Hands down the best cheese curds I've ever had. The accompanying dill dip was good, but app could have been a masterpiece with an additional side of marinara. Atmosphere is lively and comfortable. Nice place. Recommended."}
{"text":"Good burgers and they're peanut butter milkshake is amazing."}
{"text":"Beautiful decor, tasty cheese curds, and very nice serving staff. Always there when we needed them! I enjoy the burger selection and that they politely ask (on the menu that is) so hold off on the substitutions. I bet that makes their job a lot easier than most restaurants! Well done!!"}
{"text":"I visited Dlux this evening (Wednesday, 5:30pm) for the first time and was very impressed, both with the food/drink and the service. When I arrived, I was a little flustered for a few reasons - one of them being that I needed some change for the meter in the ramp I had parked in. When I asked the bartender, Michael, if he was able to give me change for a $10, he informed me there was a free ramp right down the street, for Dlux customers. He also engaged me in humorous conversation and immediately put me at ease. I moved my car, and it was on to the drinks.  I had a double fina margarita, which, to my surprise, was premixed and dispensed out of a gun. Nonetheless, it was delicious! So much so that I had two more.  Unfortunately, my date bailed on me early on, but I was hungry, so I stayed for dinner. I ordered the green chile burger, which was hot and cooked to perfection. A side of sweet potato fries was the perfect complement to the burger. I definitely recommend this place and plan on returning, especially now that I know about the brunch bottomless mimosas! I also want to go on record saying that having worked in customer service myself for the past ten years, I have extremely high standards in that realm. They were not just met but exceeded here!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants in Madison! I don't know where to begin.  When you walk in, at first you feel like the place might be too fancy for you, but after perusing the menu, you realize that this is one of those places that makes delicious food and provides an elegant atmosphere at a reasonable price.  One item to highlight is their kegged cocktails. They make a variety of different fruity cocktails from scratch and serve them on tap. I got the citrus one and it was one of the best mixed drinks I've had in quite a while.  Besides the drinks, the food is pretty impressive. We got the squash soup, sweet potato fries, and a mushroom burger. All were excellent and ended up being quite affordable.  One thing to watch: expect a wait if going Thursday-Saturday; we tried to go last Thursday and ran into a 45 minute wait."}
{"text":"We came here after arriving at the Alliant Center for the FMCA International Rally.   We were so hungry after not eating all day and loved the reviews of this place.  We arrived at 4pm and I had the DLUX burger and hubby had the green chili and cheese burger.  They were both great."}
{"text":"I went to DLUX after hearing a coworker rave about it.  Maybe she saw things I didn't, but I wasn't impressed.  First off, when I walked into this place, it felt far too \"hip\" for a guy like me.  I'm not of the going-out and being cool type of crowd that this place feels like it caters to. I'm more of the stay-at-home and avoid others type crowd.  I like less crowded places. I was able to get past the initial vibe of DLUX's hipness and sat at the bar (because a table would have been a 15-20 minute wait).    The bartender was a really nice guy.  The beer, although expensive, was really good.  The real issue I have was about the food.  The burger was $8.50. That's not a bad price for a burger.  However, fries are extra.  So, my actual price was about $12.50 for a burger, plus $6 for a pretty small beer (so you have to order two to get through the meal).  It cost me more than twenty bucks for a basic beer, burger, and fries?  Are you kidding me?  I sat and watched the Brewer game and enjoyed my overpriced beer until the food arrived.  I got the Couch Potato burger, which is a burger with chips and a homemade onion dip on it.  It was very onion-y, which I enjoyed, but the burger was 90% bun.  The bun was great, don't get me wrong, but it had the size and consistency of a travel pillow.  It was a massive pile of bread covering too small a burger for its size.  Each bite was huge, but it was mostly bread.  That wears thin after a bit.  The bill was too high for the quality of food I got.  This is a place that's trying to survive on its hip reputation and downtown location.  Maybe I'm too simple of a rube and I don't fit into that culture, but if I'm eating glorified bar food, I want to pay bar food prices.    The burger was decent, but for that sort of money, I'd much rather go to Five Guys or Dottie's.  Sorry, DLUX.  It was fun, but probably won't be back.  There are better burgers in town."}
{"text":"Giving this place a 3 1/2 star rating. Been here 3 times now for happy hour. Their drinks are pretty good and I have split the salmon burger with my mom at the bar and it was really good. They do not really have a good variety of appetizers/ bar food though.  Would probably not come back for dinner, everything is ala carte so if you want any sides with your burger it is not included in the price of the burger. They are also 1/4 lbs burger which is just not my preference of burger size. There are plenty of other places in Madison for a burger so DLUX is not my first choice."}
{"text":"Came here with 3 of my girlfriends for girl's night and it was great! It was a Friday night so we had to wait a while, but it was well worth it!  Once we were finally seated, our waitress was super friendly and offered my friends a lot of recommendations for what to mix with what for their boozy milkshakes. They ended up going with the Vanilla Coconut shake with Bailey's and the Toasted Marshmallow shake with Rum Chata and they were kind enough to share a sip with me. So delicious!!  I got the Farmhouse burger which featured bacon, cheese, a fried green tomato, greens, and a side of tomato jam. I didn't know what to expect of the tomato jam but was pleasantly surprised with a flavor both sweet and spicy.  I ordered a side of the regular fries which were good, but I ended up regretting my choice after tasting my friend's Parmesan and Truffle Cream fries. If you are debating trying them, just go for it, you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"This has quickly become one of my favorite places in Madison and I'm surprised I haven't been on Yelp to review it sooner.  I've been 4-5 times in the last year and every visit has been fantastic.  Everything here is spot on.  They have a cool downtown night-life feel, with excellent industrial and graphic design for everything from the outside sign to the booths to the food presentation.  The staff is friendly and knowledgeable from my experiences, the drinks are great and include a lot of their own interesting creations that make you want to order them, and the food is D-licious.  Speaking of the food, it's an unbelieveable value.  Burgers are all around $8 each (which is what they specialize in), with sides being $3-4.  For a fancy downtown joint the prices are unheard of, so we've capitalized on this by making it our go-to spot before going to the bars or comedy club.  And the burgers are scrumptious, I love the Carolina coleslaw BBQ Burger and the (California?) Burger with fried egg.  The parmesean truffle fries are ridiculously mouth-watering and the sweet potato siracha ones are pretty high class as well.  I wish I could find the recipe for both sauces, although I'd probably eat way too much of it then.  The portions are also perfectly sized so that you are plenty full but not spilling out the sides of your pants.  Lastly, they have a burger of the month now, the last one I had was the Taco Burger which more than met my expectations.  I can't say enough good things about them, get down there and have a fun night out or just stop in for a quick work lunch, either way hopefully you enjoy it as much as me"}
{"text":"Highlighting a few items I have a crush on lately has become necessary.  So everyone with a soul loves ice cream, unless you do have a soul but also a serious intolerance to dairy. Even then, you'll just have to pop some of those magical fast act lactaid pills and get yourself a Chocolate Peanut Butter Pretzel Shake at DLUX. Yes, it is necessary. The rich chocolate ice cream blends with an intense dose of peanut butter in an amazing way, but it's the pretzel that rocks this milkshake. What had once been an incredibly indulgent, yet somewhat typical chocolate peanut butter milkshake is now transformed by the salty deliciousness of the pretzel. Not only does the pretzel offer a flavor contrast, but more importantly it enhances the peanut butter flavor with its salty bite. If unique and bold flavors is what you seek, then this is the shake that will make even lactose intolerant folks jump for joy.  Now sweet potato fries are all the rage these days. And if you're looking for arguably the best of the best, you must make a stop at DLUX. Their sweet potato fries are crisp, yet not fried so much that the sweet potato loses its characteristic sweetness. The fry is cut a bit thicker so as to retain the integrity of the sweet potato. The fries are then served with a scrumptious Sriracha mayo. DLUX, I'm impressed. Sweet potato fries and hipster Tabasco? Props for fueling the latest foodie trends."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places in Madison. The burgers are amazing, and their appetizers are to die for. It's a cool, calm place. They make my favorite cocktails in Madison. This is my favorite place to hang out with a small group of friends late at night. Their late night menu offers discounted apps and drinks. Their food on the brunch menu is limited, but is definitely delicious.  I had a mushroom egg breakfast sandwich and breakfast potatoes, which was very good.  The best part of DLUX for brunch are the 10 dollar bottomless mimosas."}
{"text":"I was not as impressed as I should have been for what I paid. The food for one was pretty good. The asian sesame salad and sweet potato fries were both delicious! However, the service could use work... had to wait 20 minutes for a waiter to even check with us. We were ready to order by the time he got there to ask about drinks. He said he'd be right back to take our orders and then it was another 20 minutes before we were able to order. The place seems very understaffed because our waiter didn't check in over the course of the meal at all and took a long time to come collect our bills after handing them to us.  In short: food - good. service - needs a lot of work.  worth it? maybe after two drinks"}
{"text":"I was skeptical at first because of the limited choices in burgers that they had but once I bit into the one that I ordered I was hooked.  However, Service was kind of slow and I did ask for no onions but stores but still receive them so that is why I have to give them four stars."}
{"text":"Coming here after approx. 17 hours of fasting, so we expected to have something beyond good to conquer our hunger and thirst. Having read some good reviews, we were planning to give DLUX a try! And here is how our story at Dlux started....  Welcomed by a male wait staff, we were seated at the corner. I took a look at the space, interior, decoration. As a no bar person, I didn't feel intimidated at all with their overall interior.  They do have a bar but the restaurant (as a place to have a proper meal, not only drinks) stands out too. The ambience feels so romantic with only little lit and people eating there seemed to enjoy their food and their conversation.   Right after we sat, the waitress came with two glasses of water. Her name is Colleen and she's been awesome since the beginning till the end of our dinner session. She explained today's special: some beef burger (with ham, too bad for us) and Pistachio milkshake! yay!   I ordered that special milkshake and hubby ordered the salted caramel one. Two of them rocked! But still, everything with Pistachio is good and that was like the best milkshake ever---- the Pistachio milkshake highlighted our evening.  We started our meal session by having the french onion dip. It came in a big portion so hubby and I could share. It was another good choice. Colleen was being very awesome and accommodating when I told her that we couldn't have something with pork. She came up with another yet also flavorful burger. So, our main dishes were shrimp burger and portabella mushroom burger, with the sweet potatoes with mayo as the side dish. Hubby loved the sweet potatoes, which came in a medium size. During our meal, she always made sure that all was well and our glasses refilled. Overall, our story at DLUX was a happy ending one: We had an awesome waitress, and the drinks and meals we ordered were THE BOMB.   IT WAS a D(e)LUX(e) dining experience. Till next time, Dlux! We'll def. be back :)"}
{"text":"Love this place. Could eat the chips and french onion dip every day!"}
{"text":"DLUX has a unique selection of burgers.  My favorites are the DLUX and the Backyard BBQ burgers. The buns which are toasted on the inside, yet soft and fluffy on the outside.  The buns hold up well which is a must when you're enjoying a juicy burger loaded with goodies.  (One thing to be aware of is that all burgers are cooked to one temperature, so don't expect to order your burger medium rare.)   The Parmesan truffle fries and sweet potato fries are my favorite sides. On the weekend, you can get delicious breakfast potatoes which are crispy on the outside and soft on the inside...add the Parmesan truffle sauce and you will not be disappointed.  The shakes are a nice treat. My favorite is the chocolate peanut butter pretzel shake with bourbon.   Tip: On the weekends, they have bottomless mimosas and a build your own Bloody Mary bar."}
{"text":"Great and unusual menu.  The Harvest Burger special was amazing!  Bleu cheese bacon fries are equally as great.  Awesome service capped it off.  Ian was super attentive, and honest and helped me get soup for the homeless man down the street.  Thank you!"}
{"text":"Have been wanting to try this place for quite awhile and glad I finally did! Although, I should have done a little more research about going on a Sunday. They have brunch with bottomless Mimosas, so there was a 45 minute wait at noon. We were there for lunch, so did not sample the brunch. I had the spinach and beet salad and the chicken sandwich with bacon, onions, cheese and avocado. Both were amazing! The salad was huge, but I ate every bit of it. The chicken sandwich was really tasty and served on a bun that held up. Did not sample the fries but they looked delicious, a must for next time. I will definitely go back to try some other menu items, but not on Sunday!"}
{"text":"Came to DLUX for brunch based on others recommendations, and wasn't impressed by the selection. The good was good, not great, but there just weren't that many choices. I did love the truffle breakfast potatoes (I'm a sucker for anything covered in truffle oil). And the breakfast sandwich I had was extra cheesy, so I'm not complaining. My boyfriend and I loved the bloody mary bar, one of the few places we've been to where you actually get to make it yourself.  I've heard that DLUX is famous for their drinks, but we only tried the bloodies. DLUX is in a great location, right off the capitol (though this sometimes makes parking difficult on weekends) and has a large window for people-watching. The interior is very trendy."}
{"text":"As an avid Food Fight fan, I was excited to finally try DLUX .  We arrived later, around 8 pm, and found the place still to be bustling enough to be fun...assuming it's because their food is so good.  While I've heard pretty mixed reviews on the place I went in without any pre-conceived notions.  Our server was very friendly and open to making suggestions.  We were excited and surprised to see Lagunitas IPA on tap here (yes I know we live in Wisconsin, but we love their craft brew from Cali too!).    Appetizer: the queso with corn served with fritos...kind of gross, but kind of good.  Reminds me of the velveeta with rotel dip you make in the crockpot.  Wouldn't order it again.  Burgers:  We had the mushroom and swiss and the sunrise burger (with bacon added).  Both were just OK...the bacon and swiss was cooked to our liking, but as a basic burger with just a few toppings, it wasn't anything special.  The sunrise burger had the egg cooked over hard (I thought most times they were at least over medium) and had no sauce or ketchup on it at all.  The addition of bacon I thought was priced reasonably at $1.25.  Fries:  We split the bacon blue cheese fries.  The fries were cooked well, but were drenched is some sort of other cheese, not blue cheese, then sprinkled with blue cheese crumbles and bacon.  If you want real blue cheese and bacon fries, head over to the Tipsy Cow just a few blocks away...those are amazing.   Ambiance and interiors were \"meh\".  Our topic of conversation was how many other better burgers there are downtown (Sardine's bar menu, Tipsy Cow, Old Fashioned)  Overall this place was just OK...if I want a good burger and fries downtown there are MUCH better options...I'm surprised it's a Food Fight restaurant!"}
{"text":"My coworkers and I were looking for a spot for dinner. Our initial choice was Old Fashioned, but the wait time was 2 hours. We decided to kill that idea and walk around and try something else. Since I've already tried Old Fashioned, I was glad to try something new.   By the end of the night, I was glad to have stumbled into this spot. The restaurant was not entirely packed, but there was a good amount of customers. The five of us sat in a very tight booth, this place probably won't be able to accommodate large parties too well. At night, the restaurant was dark, had loud music, and tv screens plastered everywhere. Overall, this was a great place to chill.   I ordered the Sunrise Burger, it was great! I'm a big fan of burgers and I love them even more when they come with a fried egg. This place did not disappoint! They also added  shoestring fries in the burger. I would recommend having the tomato jam on the side. I liked it in my burger, but my coworker didn't. My only complaint, the patty wasn't hot...it was just warm. However, I still enjoyed it. All their burgers are $8, but you have to order your fries on the side for an additional cost. Their cheese curds were good, but if rank them third (My preference...The Old Fashioned, then Craftsman, then DLUX. I did not like Great Danes). The rest of my party enjoyed their meal.   The service was great. Our waitress dropped by many times to refill my beverage. She also checked in to see if we needed anything. Overall, I recommend this place to people looking to avoid the crowd and enjoy some good burgers."}
{"text":"Favorite trendy burger place. I order the DLux burger and it is awesome every time. Great sides, fantastic drinks and awesome shakes. They use local ingredients and you can taste the difference . Good veggie options too so good for the vegetarians in my family as well."}
{"text":"Bottomless mimosas...enough said. The service is usually pretty good. I've had the portobello mushroom burger and it was amazing, although messy. I love all their fries. Their breakfast food is only so-so."}
{"text":"The place was packed on Saturday night, usually a good sign, but I think people are going to get over this place quickly. Strange service, greeted with \"What's up.\" nothing more. Food is tasty, when it's cooked, I got served a burger that was still raw... considering it's a burger joint, that really shouldn't happen. I won't be back."}
{"text":"Went here for dinner tonight.  We had the Pimento burger, and the Farmhouse burger. We got 3 small orders of fries to try.  The blue cheese fries, the cheddar & green onion fries, and the sweet potato fries with the Sriracha mayo. My Farmhouse was pretty darned good.  Hubby's Pimento was good too.  The blue cheese & the cheddar fries were both very good.  The sweet potato fries ROCKED.  Soooo good!  We split a Salted Carmel Pecan shake.  OMG.  The best damn shake we've EVER had!  We'll be back."}
