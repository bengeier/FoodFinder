{"text":"Excellent value for money! It's not your harbour sixty but it is definitely a good piece of steak. The place is upstairs and when we went on a Friday night, it wasn't that busy. Lots of extras that comes with your piece of steak including very delicious garlic bread, 3 different kinds of spreads, salad, baked potato, olives, and pickles."}
{"text":"This is a hidden gem!  A local neighborhood steak house that offers  great value yet fantastic steaks.  It's the classic old-world steak house experience - dark lighting, dark wood furniture, red velvet.  It's upstairs with a side entrance above a deli of the same name (same owner - with super pastrami and corned beef sandwiches!).  They have a fantastic set of goodies that come along with your steak - salad with a greek dressing, pickles, garlic bread with tramasalada and more.  The steaks are always perfectly grilled and they have the classic baked potato toppings.  This place is a great deal - probably 1/2 the price of most steak houses - and has a very friendly staff.  When you discover this under-the-radar spot, you will be pleased!"}
{"text":"Old, dingy, and intimate atmosphere with an authentic mom-and-pop feel. A typical diner menu. What amazed me about his place was how cheap everything was. The burgers for example were the cheapest I've had in Toronto ($4.40 circa May 2012!!!). Far from being the best burger, but considering it's size and quality, I'd say it was an amazing value. The patty was actually quite good. They're apparently made from the stakes they make."}
