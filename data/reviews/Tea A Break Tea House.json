{"text":"Meh.  Compared to a lot of other bubble tea houses, this hasn't raised the bar, or given me an experience worth going back for.   I ordered the hot taro tea, and it was great, a little too sweet for my taste though.  The decor itself is nice, unique, themed on One Piece. Which is nice! I'm a huge fan of One Piece!   Tea is great, decor is great, it was the customer service that made me pack my bags and never look back.  My boyfriend and I were sat in a dingy corner. It was INCREDIBLY loud (which is okay really for a bubble tea house), but it felt almost as if the owners knew all the customers there. I think it was more of a 'Friend Hangout' then anything. Because my boyfriend and I were being eyed down weirdly making us feel like 'Outsiders.'   Our server was too busy chit chatting with her friends, and we waited a good 15 minutes for our order to be taken when she finally found the will to pull away from her friends. When she took our order, it was like she was dreading it, and had other better things to do.   The tea got out to us quickly, and like I said, it was good quality. But it lacked customer service.  It's a little small in there, but honestly ... If they changed their customer service, I can see this place being a hit! Though, I don't see myself going back there anytime soon."}
{"text":"Honestly, I ended up here by accident since I initially wanted to try out the Tealicious Tea House. However, I forgot the name of the place, and when I pulled into the plaza, this was the first bubble tea establishment I saw, so I thought that I was at the right place. I would later realize upon leaving that the place I wanted to try out was across the plaza from Tea A Break. I guess I shall try Tealicious next time now that I know where it is. Now on to the review.  First off I am concerned that this place is a lawsuit waiting to happen. Not cause of the food or cleanliness, but due to it's blatant copyright infringement everywhere!! One Piece is in the ceiling, on the walls, on the menu, EVERYWHERE!!! Now when I was here, I had already eaten, so I can't review the food. I did order the Pudding Specialty Milk Tea, in a large for about $5+. I was kinda disappointed cause it just tasted like regular, really sweet milk tea. I think if they were smart they should have made it look like those Japanese creme caramel puddings, but oh well. I do recommend getting the large over the small, b/c the small glass is tall but really skinny, where as the large is essentially a large jug and only for a dollar more.  Nonetheless, I would still say that this place is overpriced for the quality of drinks. However, I did enjoy the free wifi, good service, and when I went on a Saturday afternoon it was really quiet as well.  SIDENOTE: There are games tucked away in a corner where the magazines were! I wish I had discovered it before I left, oh well. Maybe some other time!"}
{"text":"The only thing that had me interested in this place is the decor. The restaurant is brimmed with One Piece, from the \"7 Wanted Posters of Characters in One Piece\" to the walls painted with them. They made it too much like a One Piece Animed theme restaurant that I thought the food will be the same as well.   What I assume to be was disappointing, the food is just typical Chinese/Japanese cuisine like popcorn chicken to many uninspiring dishes that was brought from Go For Tea. I ordered the mince meat with rice and peach ice tea which was decent, the mince meat felt somewhat dry and the egg included kinda sucks. The peach ice tea itself was good considering its pricing.   The restaurant itself was empty even though it was close to dinner and there were a couple of fobs hanging out but only one waiter (the second one came later) there.   From what the Grand Opening Dine-in special is saying, it's 15% off but when I got the bill, they just slash off 60 cents when my meal totals around 10.50 or so.   There was so much potential to this place, while its a good place to hang out considering theres wifi, the music, the crumby and not-themed food and my hatred of fobs is pulling me out of this damn place.  Choppy is also disappointed....."}
{"text":"I was out with a group of 7 looking for a bubble tea place and we ended up here.  Horrible choice.   Firstly, the service was horrible.  There was a single female employee but she was \"too shy\" to serve us, so her boyfriend took our orders (he is NOT employed there; pretty ridiculous).  It took 30 minutes for all our orders to come (just 7 bubble teas, no food) and our order was even messed up.   The bubble tea itself was not that great.  I ordered a mango slush and it was definitely lacking in flavour.  My friends also said similar things about their drinks (except for one friend who ordered the pina colada).    When we paid, the female employee also gave me the wrong amount of change.  I don't think someone who can't count money or even serve guests should be working at a place like this.    Luckily I enjoyed the decor, which was anime themed (good thing I'm a One Piece fan), but I'm pretty sure they're using licensed characters without permission...My advice is to avoid this place and just cross the parking lot for better bubble tea."}
{"text":"Tea A Break Tea House is another new bubble tea place that opens at the plaza on Midland and North or Finch.  Opens till 1 AM makes this bbt joint a great place to hang out with friends late at night compare to Tim Hortons.  Deco is young with Anime theme so you can expect the noise level can be quite high. Asian pop music in the background with young people chatting and playing card games. (revised: noise level extremely hard as people here just like to yell and scream at one and other?)  Only one friendly server/bubble tea maker/cook  this afternoon made the wait a little longer for service and my drink.  Lychee Iced Black Tea with Tapioca ($3.99+$0.50) is nice and refreshing. The Tapioca is soft and chewy and plentiful!   Free Wifi... I can stay here for awhile... one thing missing might be some cozy sofas!  Grand Opening Specials 15% off dine in/25% off for take out till end of October."}
