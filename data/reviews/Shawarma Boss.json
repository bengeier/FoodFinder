{"text":"Serving up the shawarma box like a boss, great overall  experience, food was very tasty, ingredients were fresh and portions were more than satisfactory. I recommend the chicken box but the chicken poutine is a no brainer."}
{"text":"So so so Delicious! I can't get enough! And Halal too!  Staff is so friendly and wants to make sure you are happy and are enjoying their food. Need more Shawarma Boss all across the GTA. Oh and how about down in St.Catharines! Just a suggestion :)"}
{"text":"Got the boss shawarma (2 wraps) and boss shawarma poutine. The two wraps are a good value for money if you and another person aren't ridiculously hungry. Had enough chicken and veges in there to satisfy. Only cost $10 so had no problem with that. Ordered the boss size of the shawarma poutine and while it tasted great, it disappointed since they consistently only fill up to half the height of the box. Felt like I paid an extra ~$2 for a couple more fries. I have no problem with the amount of chicken in the poutine but it annoys me they skimp out on such a cheap ingredient. Boss box really doesn't feel boss."}
{"text":"Im here at least once a week! The food is delicious and fresh and the portions are great!!!"}
{"text":"Very tasty and fresh. The portions are quite generous as well. Very polite owners. Very clean well done shawarma Boss"}
{"text":"Their chicken shawarma is amazing! Also their shawarma poutine. The staff is very friendly and the place is very clean. The price is very reasonable too."}
{"text":"Not sure why the rating so high in my opinion. Went there based off the reviews and I got the shawarma and the shawarma salad regular box or whatever it's called and it was no good.  Shawarma was no good and the salad was horrible very salty. Only thing that was good was the chicken and that was also mediocre at best. Only ate the chicken and had to throw out the rest."}
{"text":"This is definitely my favourite go to spot for shawarma. The place is very clean and has nice decor and the staff are extremely nice. Ive tried the chicken shawarma, the chicken shawarma with rice and the shawarma poutine. I loved all of them! Make sure you do yourself a favour and go to this wonderful place."}
{"text":"Had the chicken shawarma sandwich.  Great customer service, the chicken was tasty and tender, and the ingredients were fresh.  Would definitely come back again."}
{"text":"Service was slow and it wasn't busy when I was there. The shawarma sandwich was below average and was very messy to eat. I do not recommend."}
{"text":"Meat portions are small. Food is average at best. The manager was showing attitude after I asked him to split the order into two transactions... Poor customer service. Much better shawarma places (such as Ruby's that is nearby in the mall)"}
{"text":"Very fantastic shawarma. The staff and owner were very friendly. The food is very fresh and taste home cooked. I ordered a chicken shawarma and it was amazing. My brother ordered a boss box and looked delicious. But the one thing that separates this place with other shawarma restaurants is the boss shawarma poutine. Shawarma boss has changed the shawarma game."}
{"text":"Great customer service. The servers were very helpful with suggestions. They even gave me a sample of one of the salad options to try. The shawarma box was very tasty and filling. I give it two thumps up."}
{"text":"Please don't pay attention to the negative reviews of this place. This place is really good, and you get a lot for the price. I know my falafel, and this is good (I don't eat meat so cannot comment on the shawarma)."}
{"text":"My shawarma tasted dry overall and the server never asked me if I wanted any sauce added to mine. My shawarma was not folded properly, it was folded like a quesadilla. It was COLD compared to my boyfriend's shawarma. The selection of toppings are minimal and the tabouleh was an extra 50 cents. I ended up just throwing it out. In addition to my shawarma looking and tasting less than satisfactory, my boyfriend's shawarma was completely disproportionate to mine. His was totally flat and lacked toppings. I don't recommend this place, unless you're into buying cold dry and flat shawarma.  $6.17 straight to the trash.  Shawarma boss? More like shawarma intern."}
{"text":"Needed my shwarma fix..definetly didn't disappoint! Great portion size, super fresh toppings and solid pricing."}
{"text":"Waited 25 minutes for my boss shawarma box. During business days, I cannot come back to this place."}
{"text":"This place is OK.  There are better joints around selling the same item. This joint is more modern inside but sells the same product like any other shawarma joint and because of that it is slightly pricier   The chicken was a bit dry even after the cook just cut it from the spit. For 10 bucks I got decent amount of food.  Would I go back? I don't know but it wouldn't be my first choice."}
{"text":"Great place to come when you're craving gourmet fries. Price and portion was awesome. As a vegetarian, I was super happy and satisfied. I got the falafel poutine and loaded it with veggies. The sauces are a must! Shawarma Boss you now have a regular customer."}
{"text":"The area has been without a good Shawarma place for a long time. This place is a gem and I am so glad my partner and I found them. We typically split the boss shawarma box bc the portions are really large (contrary to the poster below who was not happy with the portion, there is always two scoops of chicken). The man and lady are always super friendly!"}
{"text":"I came here the second day it was open as ordered a small shawarma wrap. The staff were very friendly and the price for a small shawarma was reasonable ($3.99).  Everything tasted fresh and I loved the spicy sauce they added. The shawarma was full of flavour but the only downside was the pita was not warm. The pita was actually kind of cold and dry. I also thought they they folded the pita strangely, compared to other shawarma places.   However I can appreciate that it was their opening weekend and they were working out a few kinks. I would definitely go back to try them again because their food is tasty and I'm happy to have a new place to eat that offers vegetarian options."}
{"text":"The shawarma is great here, in fact it's my new favorite place for shawarma.  Better than the other places up the road at Lawrence Ave and the two for $7.99 makes it a great deal."}
{"text":"Came around 2:00pm on a weekday and it wasn't busy.  Ordered the regular shawarma box.  Comes with all the typical fixings shawarma places have to offer.  Chicken was very good, tender and juicy, everything else was fresh.  Place was very clean too. Will come back again when I'm in the area.   Damage was about $10."}
{"text":"I was craving a shawarma plate and figured I would give this spot a chance. Compared to other places in scarborough this spot is just okay."}
{"text":"It's for a much nicer interior that most shawarma places on Lawrence that look run down and seem like noone cares cz it's cheap. (Talking bout Decor)   Flavour wise, it's good. Not the worst neither the best. I always their their BOX - specially the shawarma poutine box - it's filling and good!   Usually get Regular size (which is enough for one person) - but got the \"BOSS'\" size (large $10.99) - but ...the quantity of fries was the same as regular :/ kind of sad.   Hopefully they explain how this size works.  It's HALAL - gets his chicken from a halal meat store down the road  The beef comes from the costco in the area that is Business Costco -, they serve Islamic  hand slaughtered beef"}
{"text":"Fantastic shawarma and fries! I don't usually venture down here but I was running some errands and was close by.  I did a quick check on Yelp for some good eats and found this place.  I was not disappointed.  The  chicken shawarma was tasty with all the right fixtins.  What actually surprised me were the fries.  They were nice and crispy.  I honestly wish this place was closer to where I live."}
{"text":"What in the world is going on here. Friday night busy crowd and only 1 worker in entire store.  Took forever to get our order and it was burnt because she was trying to do cash and cook.  Never washed her hands after touching the money.  I feel bad for her she was trying her best but the management is at fault here.  She had so many orders she had to complete she wasn't even able to take new orders for over 15 mins; customers were just sitting and waiting for her to be free again.  On the plus side the worker was friendly and tried her best to serve you.  On to the food, nothing much to rave about, got the Chicken/Beef mixed Boss box and it was mostly salad and lack of meat. It could be she was running out so she made the portion smaller.  Not too impress with the meat quality so it was dry and rubbery for the beef.  Chicken was decent but they ran out so I only got a few pieces."}
{"text":"Had a lovely experience here. There seemed to be a husband and wife duo working that day and they were quite friendly. Much cleaner than the typical shawarma place im scarborough. I was also pleased to see that the pricing was very fair; i figured it would be more expensive considering it was a nicer venue. I got a regular sized shawarma box, which was about $9. The portion was very generous, and overall it was delicious. It came with this orange rice, which was good, and it also cam with a spring mix instead of regular lettuce. Overall it was a good shawarma, however it wasn't spectacular in the taste. If youre looking to try a new place in the area, highly reccomend! Try splitting a boss size box, and save yourself a few bucks."}
{"text":"Standard run of your mill shawarma, I would expect this kind of shawarma wrap if a school cafeteria was serving one.  The interior has a little more atmosphere than other middle eastern restaurants and seems pretty clean.  One plus for the wrap I received was that the shawarma artist mixed all the ingredients up which I really appreciated. Pushed it from a 2 to a 3. Cheers to him"}
{"text":"I've tried their shawarma poutine and it's delicious when topped with everything on it.  The shawarma on rice is also good as they get up the rice a little so gives it an extra flavour.  Generous portions of meat given. Great bang for buck. Also it is halal."}
{"text":"Hmm what to say about this place. Well first let me say it has a nice and cozy eating area the people who own the place are very nice the food was good. I got the chicken shawarma and the beef shawarma both we quite good in size and taste overall the food was good and the price was right. Next time I'm in the area I will give the shawarma poutine a try. My wife gave the box shawarma a try it just as good as the wrap but a bit more bang for your buck"}
{"text":"We decided to give this place another try, 3 weeks later to see if they could improve. My husband initially made a post her that portion sizes were to small and lacked meat protein. I went back yesterday and was happy to see that I had significantly had more food in their box. Food was delicious. I hope it now remains consistent the next time I bring my husband back!"}
{"text":"I got a falafel here and it was great. It appeared to be toasted on a panini grill however it was delicious.  The restaurant decor is nice, and unlike most of the shawarma places on Lawrence Ave., it is spacious, and has good ventilation.   The staff are friendly.  Under the glass at the counter, there was Nutella and maple syrup, I suppose they serve a dessert with those as toppings, I will have to check those out another time!"}
{"text":"Incredible value, excellent flavor and friendly service.  Two massive shawarma sandwiches for 9.99 - ridiculously generous.  I will definitely be back soon.  Thanks you Shawarma Boss!!!"}
{"text":"Nice staff and good food, but seems like an underdeveloped business model.  I've been here a few times and the wait time is a bit ridiculous, entirely due to understaffing and having whoever turns up fill in on a job that they have no idea how to do.  I'm not sure that health code standards are followed in the kitchen.  The food has the right flavour, but mostly is prepared in advance and reheated when you order.  Shawarma is more like a grilled pita sandwich and the most important ingredient is missing.  No hummus?"}
{"text":"Came here for the first time. Clean place to eat, friendly staff. Although it wasn't busy, the wait time was long. For a regular box and regular sandwich we waited over 20 mins. Food was fresh but basic, nothing to rave about. Halfway through eating I noticed s familiar flavour... Big Mac from McDonald's. That's right it tasted like a true Big Mac. Not too sure if it was because of the combo of sauces mixed with pickles, but it turned me right off. Not too sure if we will b returning here anytime soon. Thanks."}
{"text":"I got the Regular Falafel Box with Salad. The falafel was made to perfection and the salad was very flavourful and tasty. I really liked the homemade special garlic sauce that was recommended by one of the servers. Overall experience was great, I would go back again."}
{"text":"I wanted to wrap up my latest Toronto visit with some good shawarma, and this place had good reviews, plus the name. If you say you're the boss, you gotta mean what you say. It's a pretty lofty expectation that this venue sets by its name alone.   Unfortunately, the boss wasn't in today.  I usually love hole in the wall spots like this, but this entire experience showed that shawarma boss is the boss...of mediocrity.   After eating a \"boss box\" consisting of chicken, yellow rice, lettuce, onions and tomato, there's no doubt I was satiated (despite the small amount of chicken in the box). Unfortunately, I left with hunger pangs for a better shawarma experience.   The man behind the counter was telling customers he was out of a particular meat (I didn't hear which) and to come back in a half hour.   Pros: they give you plenty of napkins  Cons: value for money, location, no cutlery or drinks other than bottles of water and soda.   If you're at the nearby flea market or in the immediate area of Warden and Eglinton, it may be worth stopping in for a bite. Otherwise I would keep looking.   Price paid: $13.50 for small water bottle and the \"boss box\" that was more rice and vegetables than meat."}
{"text":"Really love this place.  Great service and consistent with the food. The shawarma box & falafel box are both great! I just can't understand why the extra charge for a spoon of hummus & tabouli.  Literally you get a spoon added to your order."}
{"text":"I have tried the Shawarma wrap and the Regular Shawarma Box, and the food is great. It has a great balance of vegetables, meat and rice (Shawarma box). I have already referred Shawarma Boss to my work colleagues and they are very happy with the outcome. The only thing I would improve on is the speed, I was the only customer and my order from beginning to end took 15 minutes, for people who are on their lunch break, may find that a bit of a turn off, as their time is already limited. I also called to put in a pick-up order (to cut down on time spent at the restaurant), but there was no answer. Overall, the experience was great! Friendly staff, great food, this is a new establishment therefore I understand that it may be slow, but once they are more established I hope their speed would improve. I'll be back! :)"}
{"text":"Best tasting shawarma in the area the prices are worth the portion size just a bit low on meat."}
{"text":"on June 26th, my husband and I went to eat shawarma, we are customers, and we go at least once a week, but yesterday was certainly our last day, I being pregnant in the middle of the request I decided to add a small potato chips, he the owner of the establishment frowned and began to treat us rudely throwing the chips on the counter as if it were rubbish, and I was trying to apologize for all this, he did not even look in my face, and began to attend other people, super uneducated, I felt embarrassed, I will not come back."}
{"text":"Walked into this place after craving some shawarma and having found nothing good in the area. The guy behind the counter (I think the owner) was super nice. Had a nice little chat before he helped me and my girlfriend order. The food was very fresh, veggies at places like this are usually pretty bad so I was impressed. We got the shawarma box and the portion is good for $9, maybe a bit more chicken would've been cool but it was still satisfying.  I will definitely be coming back the owner was a nice guy and the food was good, especially in this area which has some lacklustre dining."}
{"text":"Delicious sharwama poutine, the combination of the sauces and veggies make it a very unique meal. If you're in the area this place is a must try! The store is clean + has a fantastic layout & the staff are really friendly.    Will definitely return for a sharwama  next time !"}
{"text":"Mainstream Shawarma for an okkkk price. I did like that the chicken meat was all white, but the quality of the rest of the food was average.   If you love Shawarma, you're better off going to an authentic place anywhere along Lawrence Ave in Scarborough where the restaurants are family owned and offer authentic Shawarma at a better price."}
{"text":"Update:  My wife has been back 2x since this review.  She has reported back to me that she is now very happy with the quantity in the Boss Box on both occasions.  With this in mind, I will increase the review to 5 stars.  Redeemed!"}
{"text":"SERIOUSLY DELICIOUS. the owner is so lovely and really cares about his customers. Got the chicken shawarma box with the works - it was enough for two meals and had some really amazing flavors. great value and really really good food. Also! super cute atmosphere!"}
{"text":"It was getting late and we came here on a whim. Plus we were hungry and it was just around the corner from where we were. The food was actually not bad. The place was clean. The lady behind the counter was really friendly and had good suggestions. The prices were reasonable and the portions were more than decent!   We had one boss sized chicken Shawarma with rice. The chicken was flavourful but the garlic sauce could've been a little more garlicky. And, one felafel sandwich. The sandwich was even grilled on a Panini press.  Next time I'm in the area and need something quick, I will be coming back."}
{"text":"Really good. Downtown indie feel in Scarborough. Come here once in a while mom and pop operation. So you know the food is good."}
{"text":"Now one of my two favorite shawarma places in the area, and there are quite a few!  Selection is not huge, but very focused.  The food is fresh, and plentiful.  Service was friendly, the place was immaculate.  Had the big box, it was a lot of food!"}
{"text":"This place is horrible! The chicken I had was cold the pita barley toasted and not to mention they charge extra for everything other places give for free smh! And the service girl was super rude as well! Needless to say I won't be returning back to this place for a Shawarma Ibirhams all the way!!!"}
{"text":"This is a good place for a quick bite if your hungry and happen to be in the area.  Daily special: 2 sandwiches for  $9.99 is a good deal. We got chicken shawerrma; meat was well seasoned; toppings were fresh.  I got a water bottle and it was $1.7 with tax. That's expensive for just Kirland water bottle."}
{"text":"Amazing food, well done simple menu. Ordered the shawarma boss and was GREAT!   9$ for the sand which but hey in modern 2015 fast food era that's still a good price for home made food !"}
{"text":"This place used to be amazing but the new owners changed everything. They changed the amazing fries in the poutine and all the sauces as well. Their chcken has a weird honey mustard flavour to it now and they changed the flavour of their beer as well. Really disappointed that a new ownership could change the quality of their food so much. I used to crave Boss Shawarma up until a few months ago. It's too bad such a great place could be ruined by new owners. :-("}
