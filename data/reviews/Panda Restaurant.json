{"text":"Best chinese in ak valley. Clean affordable and good service. We are from brackenridge and its worth the 15 minute drive to new kensington. If you have the time definitely check it out"}
{"text":"nice clean place had no issues ordering and took maybe 10 mins or so for the food. ordered chicken and broccoli,  and crab rangoons. wasnt very impressed.. the chicken is very slimy feeling giving me the idea its not cooked properly and has no taste, the broccoli and rice was good. the crab rangoons of course made with immitation crab and cream cheese, normally i enjoy them elsewhere. being my first time at panda i figured they would be ok, they were way too sweet like sugar was added and felt more like a dessert-like icing instead of cream cheese..eh. coulda been worse but felt like a waste of money."}
{"text":"Best Chinese food spot in New Kensington. No doubt this place is the real deal."}
{"text":"I absolutely love the food here. It's my go to spot for when the hubby n I are craving Chinese and a movie."}
{"text":"The rice was so good, and the guy in front was so nice and sweet.  They also gave me a free soda.  I like them better than the local places in my area.  I drove 40 minutes to get there, that will show you how good it is."}
{"text":"I've always liked Panda, someone was bitching about the new owners, but I don't see much difference, it's still good and you get a lot of food."}
{"text":"Since the owner sold out to another Chinese family, the food is AWFUL!!!!  We were such a regular customer (once a week for lunch or dinner) that it was on speed dial.  Now has been removed from our phone; IT\"S THAT BAD!!!"}
{"text":"Best Chinese in the area. The food is delicious and pretty cheap. I live in Verona now and still drive all the way out there for Panda Restaurant- they are just that good."}
{"text":"By far the best takeout Chinese. Everything I had was tasty. The only thing good about downtown new kensington"}
{"text":"This is probably the best takeout Chinese in New Ken. I've never eaten anything from there that I didn't like. The prices for the food are decent also. The location makes it a bit dicey to get to, but it's family owned and not a chain, which I like as well. Highly recommended."}
