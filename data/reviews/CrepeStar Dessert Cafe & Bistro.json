{"text":"Wouldn't recommend to go here for lunch or dinner unless it's for dessert. Their rice options are kind of overpriced for what you're getting. I had the butter chicken rice and it was not authentic and was sloppily put together like some microwaved dinner. Chicken in some sauce with some spinach in addition to a teeny bit of rice.  My boyfriend ordered a pepperoni pizza and in my opinion not worth it for the price. It was small, greasy, and the crust was naturally thin and I felt that store bought frozen pizzas for $5 are better than what they served us.  I have to say the bubble tea and ice cream as well as a selection of cakes I've had are very delicious here though! Service was very quick and polite too."}
{"text":"My family always come here for the dessert crepes and it is has become an obsession for us! With winter on its way, I came today for a lunch crepe just to try their other non-ice cream offerings. I had the chicken caesar salad which was awesome as expected."}
{"text":"Went here for dessert and was not disappointed.  Had 2 crepes, one nutella, and the other build your own.  Crepe itself had a nice texture and good size.  Would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Love this place.   Last year summer, found this dessert place closeby our house. Crepes and waffles are fresh and nice. They have Kawartha ice-cream. Service is good and the owner is nice too.   We tried the breaded chicken waffle with maple syrup. It was delicious. I wish they can make it with chicken breast breaded and deep fried, instead of chicken fingers.  Overall, it's a nice place to go to in Newmarket."}
{"text":"One of my favourite places to go when I'm back visiting my parents in Newmarket. Such a great selection of food, the staff and owner is awesome so warm and inviting. My favourite thing is the smores crepe, you have to try it if you are a smores fan!"}
{"text":"The ham and cheese crepe and then Nutella and banana dessert crepe were wonderful. Flavorful and fresh ingredients. The owner provided friendly service and made us feel at home. This was my second visit and I will be back!"}
{"text":"Independant owner - eager to please. Not just crepes - treats and desserts are many but breakfast and rice options also. Ice cream varieties. Good coffee."}
{"text":"We live in Richmond Hill and delightfully do the trek up to Newmarket for the desserts. The crepes & waffles are sensational & perfect texture, and we really like the way the menu option is set up to choose your options for toppings!  Great setting, very clean, owner and staff are super friendly and its cool that they open late.  We dined three times in one week!"}
{"text":"Desserts! This place is all about desserts, sweet drinks, coffees, and more desserts. I stopped by this place before going on a road trip. I picked up some bubble tea with jelly. The owner was happy to let me try out the different jelly flavours, as well as the bobba balls and tapioca as well. While I only had these drinks, I was thoroughly pleased with the options available, and will be returning here when I need a dessert fix. They also sell ice cream cakes as well, which intrigue me, as I've heard they have a crunchy interior like the DQ cakes."}
{"text":"Fabulous crepes! We were in Aurora for dinner and had a craving for some dessert crepes.  CrepeStar was one of the few \"nearby\" places, so we took the drive there... We were not disappointed.   The place is diner style, has board games to play, and is very welcoming. The crepes themselves are very thin (the way they should be) and tasty. I will say stick to the traditional savoury flavors like chocolate and strawberries/bananas...  I did venture and got a smores crepe as well and that was way to sweet for my taste buds."}
{"text":"This place has great staff, service and food for very good prices. Truly the best dessert/dinning experience in the GTA! Great concept!! The atmosphere is amazing!! Check it out!!"}
{"text":"It was a rainy Sunday in boonieville and the day's planned activity was a long drive through the country here to East Gwillimbury to check out CrepeStar. It was a bit difficult to locate as it's inside a big retail complex and trying to just follow the addresses as you drive along didn't work. It's tucked in a nicely pavered laneway with a few designated parking spaces, one of which we luckily were able to use. The storefront is attractively decorated and I was gung ho to go.  The staff generously allowed us to use the big comfy circular booth, even though it was just the two of us.  I'd never had a Vietnamese coffee before, so I had to try it.  I guess I'm not as smart as I looked to the server - when he brought it to the table, he didn't presume to have to explain to my noobness that you really have to wait for the espresso to drip slowly through the filter sitting atop the condensed milk waiting inside the cup, and that the little pot of hot water is for you to dilute it to your taste once the coffee is in the cup.  I have espresso for blood so I drank it straight with only the condensed milk, and it was pretty good.  I only wish that I had waited to have it served after the meal to enjoy it as a dessert digestif!  Both of us had savoury crepes.  I had the Ham and Cheese crepe, with mushrooms added as an extra item.  BF had the Cajun Chicken Crepe.  They were OK but that's about it.  The crepe itself is nicely made but the filling ingredients only taste so-so, basically just like pulling average stuff out of the fridge at home and whipping it up together, and with less cheese than I'd use at home.    I wish I had ordered a dessert.  I suspect I would have a better overall liking of the place if my experience here had included one.  BF did order the Bailey's Mudslide Sundae, but it turned out to be a disappointment because of the way it's presented on the menu - it is listed as a Coffee Sundae, but it doesn't come with any.  Arf!  The staff did presume that we wanted a very leisurely stay, which I suppose was an attempt to be nice and leave us alone to discuss some plans we had mentioned, but I couldn't even make eye contact when we did want to get going.  We sat so long just sitting and waiting for a check on us that I finally had to get up and pay the bill at the cash register.  I actually want to like this place better than 3 stars, but I can't based on this visit.  I don't even know yet whether I'd make it the destination of another rainy day afternoon drive, but if I do, I hope it turns out to be at least 4 stars since I think it has the potential."}
{"text":"I love the ice cream.... Kawartha, of course!!!   I would normally just go to Demet$@@ (shhhh), but it is so great that we have something up here in Newmarket.   The set up is like a diner style. Several booths, and there is a few two-person tables. Free wifi. Service is good, well relaxed. The selection of crepe, waffle, and toppings is good. I mean, it is enough to make a combination of either savoury or sweet dish to enjoy. I have only tried the sweet crepe (i.e., ice cream crepe, as opposed to waffle and chicken).   On to the food. Crepe and ice cream were so good. I shared mine with one other person but you could eat it one by yourself. The price was $11-ish for the crepe with one flavour ice cream with two toppings and sauce.   Someone in our party ordered apple cider drink. Don't do it. I felt that it was just apple juice from the can, heated up, in the microwave. Stick to the ice cream crepe or waffle."}
{"text":"Holy crèpe!  This place hit the spot.  We started out with the new Build Your Savoury Crèpe and they were amazing.  The sauce selection is awesome and the crepes were fresh and perfectly thin.   Then came the dessert crèpe. Nutella strawberries bananas.  Heavenly.   Great friendly staff too."}
{"text":"This is my second visit to CrepeStar in 2 wks! This is definitely a hit amongst my family and friends! We have tried a few more items on their menu, including their milkshakes which are thick and very good! They also feature La Rocca cakes (I'm trying their tiramisu cake tonight)."}
{"text":"Awesome service here. Great selection of food and well priced. Desserts looks awesome. I ordered the chicken pesto pizza and it was good. I would prefer a thinner crust pizza as it was a bit too thick for my preferences. Crepes looks delicious as well but unfortunately I can't eat both at the same time. Decor is spacious and clean. Staff are very friendly and accommodating. Can't wait to come back with my hubby to eat their crepes and desserts!"}
{"text":"I miss the \"Just Desserts\" locations that were sprinkled around the GTA. But CrepeStar comes to the rescue!  I enjoyed a Pecan and Salted Caramel crepe, and a cappuccino. Everything appears to be fresh made, and was very good.   But wait-there's more!  It appears CrepeStar is no longer limited to desserts. They now have a selection of very intriguing breakfasts and lunches. Reading over the menu had me wishing I had not just finished dinner. I need to try the \"non-dessert\" options. Will report back..."}
{"text":"I was in the area with a friend so why not try someplace new?  I customized my own waffle with raspberry sorbet, brownie bits, lychee boba, and strawberry sauce.  Their Wednesday special was to buy any waffle and get half price drinks so I also got the steamed long fog latte.   I really like how the London fog latte wasn't overly sweet which balanced out the ice cream and bobas from the waffle. It was sorta like a good cleaning palette.   Pros: -service is good  -they serve kawartha ice cream!!  -quiet and not overly busy   Cons:  -location is s but far from where I live, so I won't be coming back frequently. however, if I am in the area, I would definitely come back and out the other items on the menu!"}
{"text":"3rd time here. Again...Great service, nice and clean interiors and awesome food. Waffles and crepes are fresh and full of flavour."}
{"text":"It's a pretty cool place up north to have dessert. There are tons of selection for ice cream and you can choose whatever you like on your waffle and crapes.  When we were there, the place was a bit quiet which was very good as a dating location :) The waitresses were friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"My Fiancé who was \"too full to eat dessert\" just ate my entire sundae!  That's how good this place is!!   Very delicious I love the desserts and come here quiet often for them.  the coffee is also very nice.  Today is the rest day I tried the Vietnamese slow drip coffee and yes it is slow drip, hence the name, but very good over ice!    My fiancé always gets the cappuccino and loves it.  This place is very cute, decorated really nicely and is super cute.    The owner is such a great guy.  He comes around to say hi to us every time!    By the way, they just applied for their liquor license.  Once they get it.... Man I'll be here every weekend!  Overall great place!  Approx $10-$15 a dessert and $5 ish for drinks!  Worth it though trust me :)"}
{"text":"Was here during the week and tried the egg and spinach crepe it was delicious. I had a latte as well but I actually prefer their brewed coffee. The brewed coffee is excellent. The waffles are great too they are warm and soft and not too crunchy. A great place to go for a crepe."}
{"text":"Absolutely loved this place! They have a great deal of varieties to choose from and if you can't decide you can just customize your crepe/waffle. Will definitely be coming back here!"}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place! I have tried their cakes, waffles and crepes for different occasions and it's the best dessert place around the area. It's also a great place to hang out with your friends or a date for a dessert night."}
{"text":"Amazing, though the prices are some what high I love this shop. I like the boba tea especially. It's a nice place to hang out while you do your work. Almost like a Starbucks but more fancier I guess.  It could also be a little group hangout place or a great date idea swell for some of you thought It's more of a desert place it's still enjoyable.   It'd sad that it is in a secluded area and no houses are around it cause it would be nice to just walk there and not have to drive every time. I usually just buy the boba there but the waffles are great to."}
{"text":"Decent food, nothing that makes it stand out from other crepe places in the area. Quite pricey for the amount and quality of food that you get."}
{"text":"Service always prompt and friendly. Have been here twice and both experiences have been great. Crepes are delicious and they serve Kawartha Dairy ice cream!!!"}
{"text":"My friend and I have been here twice for our catch up sessions. It's fairly new and not overly busy. The staff are friendly and know when to approach the table and when to step back.   We ordered the pesto chicken crepe and night and day crepe. Both were delicious!"}
{"text":"Love the place. I love waffles. And crepes and pizza and BBT. This place has all that and more. Yum yum yum   Location Way up in the wilds of East Gwillimbury. In a section people still call Newmarket!  Parking:  its in the far suburbs. So here's your turn to drive because parking is cool. You drive when there's no parking stress, let someone else drive when there's lots!! Fair trade. Haha  Decor: Very modern, lots of big windows to let in the light. There are diner type tables as well as a booth in the back.  There's a book case with games because they let you play games if you want. Because they are cool like that!!  It's a cool vibe. Great to come for a girls night or bring your mom and kids! There a quieter place in the back that perfect for a date night too!  Food: Omg the food. Drooling just thinking about it!  I love the waffles here. They the right amount of crisp and sweet. The light kind not the densely packed ones you get at some other places. They savoury ones are actually my favourite believe it or not. That being said, add a scoop of strawberry kawartha dairy ice cream, whipped cream and some caramel and I'll be happy!!  There's fantastic regular food too, pizza, rice dishes. Heck if you want a kale salad, you can find that here too!!!    And bbt, oh they also have a liquor licence so you can get sangria, wine,beer, and liquour! Mmm Baileys in coffee!  Staff: Everyone is so nice too!  I'll be back. That's me with the bbt and pulled pork waffle"}
