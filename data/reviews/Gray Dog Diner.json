{"text":"the breakfast sandwich is a 10. would be a 5 star but the staff has a lot of trouble bussing tables & putting silverware out. there's only 11 tables & the staff of 8 always seems panicked. tables are rarely fully stocked with condiments."}
{"text":"Yummy breakfast with the family. Can't go wrong with huevos rancheros, Greek omelette and turkey rueben"}
{"text":"Wow! Great portions, service, and prices! The farmers omelette and the corned beef omelette we're outstanding! I like the small diner setting too!! We have been looking for a place in Lakewood to have a nice filling brunch, and I think we've found it! Forgot to mention but my kids loved the pancakes and French toast too"}
{"text":"Honestly over the years this place has gone down hill. I've had multiple take out orders screwed up. Today i came to pick up my take out order and the girl gave my food to someone else. I've been sitting here for 20min waiting for them to re make my eggs. I miss the days when this place was called Tinas. I never had an issue. This will probably be my last time here."}
{"text":"Very nice people, great service was unhappy with Corn Beef, First Time their ask for Grill came out regular, meat wasn't fresh hot, it tasted heat up very chew very disappointed not one of the best to me."}
{"text":"The people here are very, very nice, but...

First, when you walk in, there is no sign or anyone to tell you just seat yourself. When the lady behind the counter was done with another customer she looked at me like I should be telling her something so I said \"Just one for breakfast\" to which she advised me to just sit anywhere if it was available.  I found a table in the corner by the window that had not been cleaned off yet, but it wasn't that bad so I took it. My waitress helped me pretty quickly and asked me what I'd like to drink, I asked for a Diet Coke. I was asked if I wanted a can or bottle, I immediately began doing the calculations in my head about which option would provide the most Coke product, I chose the bottle. As she walked away I wondered why in the world she wasn't just bringing me a cup of Diet Coke which included free refills like most places (see: everywhere). Was it really possible they charge for a drink every time you order one? Yes, yes it is. They charge $1.00 for a can of Coke. And that mattered because that's what I was given instead of the bottle. 

After the soda dilemma it was time to order, I went with the meat lovers omelet. In my opinion it was kind of expensive given the type of place it was, but in all fairness the omelet was pretty big and was hanging over the edges of my plate. It tasted good but it was no IHOP omelet. I chose the rye toast and hash browns as my sides, but when it was brought out I had home fries on my plate. The waitress mumbled something about needing to put them on my plate so she could serve it to me, but I'd be getting another plate (presumably with hash browns?). Again, I didn't quite understand what she said so I'm making assumptions on that one. That said, I didn't care that much because I didn't plan on eating them anyways. This was the spastic curly haired waitress that someone else mentioned in their review. Very nice lady but was all over the place and seemed overworked, asked me if I was ready to order after I already ordered. And I never got my other plate that she mentioned previously. Oh well. Later I saw someone with a 32 oz bottle of Diet Pepsi. Not sure if they brought it in themselves because they were aware of the situation, or if that was what you get when you order a bottle of your chosen soda product.

When I paid my check it was to my surprise that the place actually had a credit card machine. I fully assumed I'd be paying in cash based on my aforementioned Coke situation. The lady behind the counter wasn't able to give me exact change, guess she ran out of pennies. She said \"it's your lucky day you get an extra penny!\" So, I guess I came out on top?"}
{"text":"so good..we love their breakfast..courteous, clean, and delicious."}
{"text":"Looking for a place for breakfast nothing over the top just some good food went to the gray dog diner was pleasantly surprised by the service I got by waiter Melissa .it was Sunday morning and things were very busy my table was clean and I had eggs over easy home fries bacon and  rye toast coffee when the food came it was hot and good tasting, Eggs were just the way I like em potatoes were perfect bacon was great I was real happy I'll be back there again."}
{"text":"Wife and I had breakfast there on 2/19/2014...Was VERY NICE...1st time, but will not be our last.  The staff was pleasent and the food on point...Very friendly on the wallet as well...4 out of 5 only because everybody can do better, but it was a close call here for this fine eatery..."}
{"text":"The diner is cute and decorated nice. I really liked the food and the prices...corned beef hash is yummy!"}
{"text":"My wife and I stumbled onto this place by accident and we were pleasantly surprised. It is a new breakfast spot. The place has been newly remodeled and clean. The coffee freshly brewed and service is great. The food just fresh and delicious. The prices just right. The owner was there checking on us and making us feel welcome. It is always nice to have a local business that is great. Will definitely come back for tasty  omelets."}
{"text":"I love little no frills diners like this!  Good food, nice people and reasonable prices. The BLT's are simple goodness and the fries are yum. Will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"For the most part the food has always been on point every time I come here...sometimes more than once a week. However, I am really disappointed that the potato and macaroni salad recipe appears to have changed. Whatever dressing it is is too thin, and loaded with pepper. Loved the old stuff, hope they go back to that. Until then its fries or nothing."}
{"text":"Stopped here for breakfast. Friendly service. Cozy atmosphere. Homemade jam for your toast. Make sure you get the green peppers and onions in the home fries. 

Good food. Nice place to stop."}
{"text":"Never got past the front door. Even though restaurant was 3/4 empty, I was told to sit at a dingle table right next to service area. When I requested a different table I was told NO. I guess single handicapped women are not welcome. I left with my pride but an empty stomach."}
{"text":"Very pleased. The eggs were fluffy, almost creamy. They had a really good amount of fillings in their omelettes and I could only finish half. I had the farmer's, which included bacon, green peppers, onions, and cheddar. My husband had the corned beef hash and confessed that he had been hoping it was going to be minced really small like out of a can. It was! It still tasted fresh and without all the sodium. It reminded me of the had from George's Kitchen. 

For once we didn't order coffee but I have a feeling theirs would be better than most. The staff was friendly too. A good place all around."}
{"text":"I moved to Lakewood from NYC. I miss the pizza and bagels and rolls with bacon, egg and cheese. When ever I'm craving a roll with BEC I go here. They do it right."}
{"text":"Food was very good! Service not so much. I can understand in ways why the service was not all that good because it is a small place and on a Sunday afternoon it can be a little much, but the waitress we had was not attentive to my boyfriend and I at all, and was more attentive to other people there who came in after us. They burned my toast and the waitress told me she'd bring it out more toast, 20 minutes later... I had to ask her for it and she brought it out then. Then when it was time for the check she brought that out immediately then did not take it back for another 15 minutes. I had the money sitting right there the whole time. She managed to get the tables who came in after us their checks and receipts, but we had to wait quite some time. Next time I'll just do deliver because that was moving faster than sitting there."}
{"text":"I have been meaning to update this review for weeks and I'm just now finding time to do it. 

This place is awesome. I have never been much of a breakfast person to begin with which is what my first review was about. 

I have been to this restaurant just about every week since I wrote this review. Many things have changed my opinion since the first time I visited. First of all, the staff is amazing. This is the first restaurant I have ever been a legitimate regular at and they really do remember their regulars. I always get food from Gray Dog when I do laundry. One of the kitchen staff remembered something very minute from one of my last visits. It was impressive considering they get a lot of people coming in and out of those doors. 

Secondly, I love their lunches. I always get the same thing, a bacon cheeseburger with fries. It's so good. I know one of these days I'm going to have to try something else. I'm sure it's all good. 

This place gives me a reason to look forward to doing laundry. It gets 5 stars just for that. The food and the staff makes me wish I could give it more."}
{"text":"First time coming here. Diner is not loud or noisy. Very clean, and restrooms clean as well. Atmosphere is comfortable. Menu has a great variety and everything sounds good. I ordered the corned beef and egg sandwich with a side of French toast. Delicious! The server was friendly and attentive. Food came out fast. Good bang for your buck. We will be coming back."}
{"text":"Food was decent; however, it took about 45 to get our food for a table of 2 at 11am. From the looks on everyone's faces, we weren't the only ones waiting. By the time it arrived we were starving! Huevos rancheros was decent but the chorizo sauce was basically ground beef similar to that on a TBell soft taco. I mean,  it would be good hangover food. Hash browns were clearly store bought and frozen at one point in time and undercooked. 

Cute decor inside and looked clean. Much nicer than the strip mall location would lead you to expect. But overall couldn't get past how long our food took."}
{"text":"Clean diner! Good food! For what it is I would say it slightly overpriced. The food is not original in any way and I have been to similar diners where the food is cheaper. It's in a good location. The service is unorganized but this place is still new. I would give it time. They have the best of intentions and are always nice!"}
{"text":"I've always liked this place, even in its last incarnation. The Grey Dog serves nice, filling fare with prices that don't break your bank and good folks who attend to your needs. On top of that, it's right next to Katie's Clean and Green, so you can do your laundry AND have a splendid breakfast or lunch! There is limited parking and seating, but overall, if you want to be treated like a king, just stop at the Dog:)"}
{"text":"Awesome quality of food and cooking - we had the huevos rancheros and Gray Dog omelette. Excellent touch on the home fries with the option of peppers and onion toppings. The special of the day was eggs benedict. Really great menu options with very reasonable prices.

Attentive and courteous service, and a clean environment. The parking lot is small so spaces can be lacking during busy times, and it looks like a comfortable seating area for up to 4 people in a group. Any more people in a group could be tight for the space available."}
{"text":"I moved in next to St Eds and noticed this little place up the street and decided I had to try it. The interior was nicer than I expected considering it's connected to a laundromat, and damn if the food isn't fantastic. I've had almost everything on the breakfast menu and I've never had a bad meal. I used to get the biscuits and gravy every Saturday morning as a hangover cure. I had a corned beef sandwich there once and I've seen friends get hotdogs, no one has ever said a bad word about the food. Speaking of corned beef, their hash is a revelation. I could eat that every meal of the day. My only criticism is that the service can be a tad slow, but once you get your food you stop caring about the service. You'd drive right past it if you didn't know it was there, but I urge everyone to try this place. You will not regret it."}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised by this little dinner on Detroit in a little strip mall across from Saint Edward's high school. I had the Huevos Rancheros and it was nothing short of delicious. The first time I went here I had an omelet and the Home fries  that came with it were some of the best I've had. Try this little gem out, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Awesome spot within walking distance of our home.  We go here all the time.  The food is great and the service is excellent!  Please do yourself a favor and stop into to this Lakewood dining treasure!"}
{"text":"Tasty breakfast foods with a very friendly staff.  The space itself is a little cramped, but in the end the quality of the food more than makes up for this.

I had the Gray Dog omelette and my girlfriend had the Greek omelette.  Both of us were very pleased with our choices though I maintain that mine was better.

Most importantly....the coffee is fresh, hot, and readily available!"}
{"text":"Yummy and cheap breakfast! Gray Dog is a small, homey diner serving up your typical diner breakfast. Our server was very friendly and got our food out to us quickly. The huevos rancheros really stood out on the menu and it did not disappoint! Really great dish! The omelettes also sounded really good- I'll be trying one of those next time. Overall, a really great breakfast spot. Good quality and delicious food, at great prices."}
{"text":"I read good reviews about the Gray Dog so decided to try it with an Entertainment coupon.  It shares a small parking lot with a few other businesses and it was full the first couple times I circled around, then hooray, someone left!  The coffee is delicious, served in big mugs with plentiful refills, and they even have vanilla flavored cream.  I ordered the Gray Dog omelette, which was full of mozzarella cheese, red peppers, and artichokes.  My son had the Grand Slam with eggs, large sausage links and fluffy pancakes.  It was clean and homey inside and our server was so nice and accommodating.  Give it a try!"}
{"text":"I like this place! The service was great  and the food was all tasty. I got the corn beef hash. I was less than $5, on special, and the portions were huge for the price! My companion got the much lauded huevos rancheros. It looked excellent and was given high remarks. I will happily come back here, especially while I get my laundry on. Bonus: They have good coffee mugs."}
{"text":"Update. I have been back several times. Always for breakfast. The Huevos Rancheros is off the hook good. The corned beef hash and eggs is very good even compared to other top preparations in the area. 

Good service. Fresh food. Clean place. Low prices. A top local breakfast pick."}
{"text":"Eggs benedict and corn beef hash were delicious. Service excellwnt. Every table was full and the waitress was responsive. Love the decor!"}
{"text":"Came here unexpectedly. My son is a student at St. Edward High School and we had an appointment to meet one of his teachers on a Saturday. Teacher was running late, so we decided to get breakfast somewhere nearby. This place had decent ratings on Yelp, so we decided to walk across the street to try it. They had a bunch of Eds gear, so we really felt at home. We walked in and the small dining room was pretty crowded, but we were able to find a vacant table in the middle of the room and sat ourselves down. Server took our order after a few minutes. I ordered the corned beef hash platter and my son, the chili dog. As we were waiting, a few more guests started to shuffle in as others were finishing. The clock kept on ticking and we started noticing after a while that people who were seated after us were getting their food before us. But we waited patiently. About 45 minutes went by when our server decided to check on us for the very first time - just then noticing that we don't have our food yet. She checked with the kitchen to find out that they never received our orders, so she asked us again what we wanted. She apologized and explained that the printer in the kitchen ran out of paper as our order was placed, which is why it wasn't processed. Our food came out within 5 minutes after that, and she offered to comp my coffee and my son's fries as an apology. My son seemed to enjoy his chili dog, although I thought my corned beef has could have been better - it seemed to be made from canned mush and was pretty bland. I appreciate that they made an attempt to make it right (the super long wait), but I thought it was strange that it took 45 minutes to notice that we had been waiting that long without our food not being served yet. All-in-all, it's a pretty nice small business that I would likely support again - given that it's so close to my son's school, but I would say that service could use more awareness."}
{"text":"This is probably my favorite diner in Lakewood! The food is fresh and delicious and the service is always excellent. Best of all, they have real (not canned) corn beef hash! Also, be sure to try their unique off-menu dish: Captain Crunch French toast (French toast coated with Captain Crunch), it's delicious!"}
{"text":"I have eaten here several times and me and my guest have gotten sick vomiting stomach cramps Beware the hotdogs are harmful as well as the omelets ."}
{"text":"Excellent!  Very friendly but not \"in your business\" staff.  Cute decor.  Endless good coffee.  We met as a foursome at 10am on a Saturday.  No wait, space felt cozy, and we had a terrific breakfast--French toast, eggs, and perfectly cooked (not burnt) bacon.  Great prices for the value.  We also weren't rushed out when we had finished.  Will definitely return with kids for a family brunch."}
{"text":"Excellent place for breakfast or brunch. Everything is really tasty and I love that you can always add sautéd peppers & onions to your hash browns. It's got a clean, modern diner feel. The menu isn't overly complex but offers both breakfast and lunch options. Service is fairly quick and friendly."}
{"text":"Smells good!!!

So I wanted to wash my 80 lbs of bedding and a great laundromat was found on Yelp...
and in the same strip was The Grey Dog and I went in on smell alone!"}
{"text":"I went here some time last summer, and the service was fine, but the food was gross and overpriced. They charged me $9 for a BLT that had 2 pieces of burnt bacon on it. I understand you have to make a profit, but if you're charging that much for a simple sandwich, it should at least have a decent amount of one of the 3 ingredients!"}
{"text":"Food was incredible, but Grey Dog Diner still gets one star. This is not hyperbole:

I sat at the bar (overlooking the kitchen) for 45 minutes to have brunch. I watched the cook the entire time (who also happens to OWN the place!). She cooked without gloves, never washed her hands once, ATE on the line, RUBBED her face and arms and picked her pants out of...well, and wiped her hands incessantly on her dirty apron. 

EVERYONE else that worked in the kitchen wore gloves. The owner, for some reason, feels she can transcend that rule. It's one thing to cook without gloves (as many chefs do), but follow proper hand washing techniques. This behavior blows the lid off of proper food handling techniques that every cook should employ, as it is not just a matter of grossness but is a matter of public health responsibility."}
{"text":"Average greasy spoon spot with large portions and fast service. Nothing to write home about but. O thing awful
Either. Go for the grease"}
{"text":"Love this little diner! They have really good food and service is always excellent. It's kind of hard to spot from the road so it's really easy to drive past it, but keep your eyes open if you want to eat at this tasty spot."}
{"text":"Really good breakfast and looks like a fun little place for a burger and fries.  Homemade strawberry jam was great!!!!"}
{"text":"It's a diner, but a very clean diner with a fresh interior. The staff is friendly and the menu has just the right amount of options. The value is also very good. I'll be back."}
{"text":"I like having another option in Lakewood, and within walking distance of my house too. My experiences at Gray Dog have been mixed. First let me start with the good. 

Best biscuits and gravy I have ever had. Maybe a tad salty, but insanely rich and decadent. 

Now the not-so-good. The staff doesn't seem to have any customer service skills whatsoever and often have all the personality of a garden gnome, minus his friendly smile. The waitress we usually get isn't the brightest bulb in the joint and often seems confused by the simplest questions. Doesn't fill you with confidence when you stump your server with a humdinger like \"do you have 7Up or Sprite?\" 

One night I ordered chicken fried steak with sausage gravy. Remember earlier I said they had the best sausage gravy and biscuits, so you can imagine my excitement to order this dish. Picture my face when my chicken fried steak with sausage gravy came sans sausage gravy, but with brown gravy instead. Disappointed beyond belief. I brought this up to the waitress who seemed as confused as ever. She asked the cook who also seemed confused at how one could assume that chicken fried steak with sausage gravy would actually come with  sausage gravy on it. She asked if I wanted her to bring me sausage gravy but I wasn't sure the two gravies would mix all that well. I will give them another chance as I do like to support local businesses within walking distance of my home. 

FYI their chili is also very good. 

This now concludes the Yelp review with the most ever references to sausage gravy."}
{"text":"Started making this place part of my Saturday morning laundry mat routine. Drop the laundry and relax at the Gray Dog. The Huevos Rancheros are crazy good. They give good portions as well.
Very friendly people. Overall a great place to stop in for breakfast, brunch or lunch. 

Oh and they will sell you their coffee mugs."}
{"text":"They charged me $5.50 for this! This is the last GD time I come here. Did not get my money's worth. To bad Bob Evans was not open."}
{"text":"I have been to this diner several times over the last 12 months, always for breakfast. Each visit was the same -- excellent.

The staff is attentive, the food arrives quickly and the prices are reasonable. Everything I've tried on the breakfast menu has been outstanding. From omelettes to pancakes to just plain old fashioned scrambled eggs, home fries and toast, the portions are generous (especially for the money) and everything tastes great. 

The coffee here is particularly good. Big mug, generous refills and very good quality. Some of the best diner coffee I've had. 

Overall, one of the best breakfasts around."}
{"text":"Pretty good. I had the huevos rancheros and my brother had the farmers omelette. Everything was well prepared and hot! Excellent service and food! We will be coming back!"}
{"text":"Very nice people there. The menu seems very much the same as most diners and what I ordered was ok but I have to conclude after a total of four visits that I'd rather pass on it."}
{"text":"I feel that I've eaten enough eggs benedict in my life to report the good, the bad, and the ugly.  Well.... I ordered the eggs benedict and it was not good, but it wasn't that ugly either. It hurts me to say that it was bad, but I just want to be authentic to myself and diners everywhere.   I was expecting a creamy-smooth decadent and delicious hollandaise sauce, However, the flavor of the sauce was odd and the texture was gloopy.  Also, the home fries could've been better.  I appreciated the fact that they left the skin on the potatoes (after all, that's where all the vitamins are),but the potatoes were mushy and it could've used a little butter/grease to up the crispy factor.  The diner itself is really cute and has some whimsical elements.  Service was top notch too.  I'm just not sure if that's enough to bring me back with all the other options in the area."}
{"text":"Accidentally came in 15 minutes until closing not realizing the time and the staff were the most hospitable, generous, and kind people I've experienced. The food that we had was excellent! Deffinitely come support this business."}
{"text":"Been here a few times with my daughter over the past few incarnations and name changes.  This time came on a Sunday morning.  The server girl is the same as before and has to be one of the nicest girls ever.  Super clean and deorated nicely without tring to be hip or over the top.  Ordered one kids basic breakfast and one basic adult breakfast.   I even made all of it the same (toast, over easy eggs, round sausage, etc.)  I have worked in restaurants and I understand people can be douches and be difficult and run the kitchen to death.  Got our food quickly, too quickly.  All of our food except the eggs and toast were WAY underdone.  I asked the girl to just have them tnrow the same food back on the flat top and cook it longer.  I wasnt even gonna be an ass and have them make me all new food....just COOK the food I had!  Came back out, new eggs, sausage was a tad more done and frickin hash browns were the SAME as before.  Barely warm and still white.  Just call them boiled potato sticks then and call it a day.  A nice topper to this is that I get to hear the cook girl gripe about sending undercooked food back.  My advice would be learn how to crisp hashbrowns and sausage patties..its rocket science.  Also, when I pile all the undercooked and inedible food (after sending it back once) on my plate and asking for my tab thats a sign that we didnt dig our food.  I was still charged for the uneaten food too.  There are so many diners in Lakewood and I would recomend eating at another.  This chick rushes food out underdone, then huffs and puffs about it.  The only reason I would come back if for the server who is as sweet as Tupelo honey."}
{"text":"Great food!!! Very nice place, clean, comfortable i had the huevos rancheros and coffee. The only bad thing was the service, very slow, other than that i would have gave them 5 stars.  I will be back again, highly recommended!!!!"}
{"text":"Was in Cleveland looking for a good breakfast spot. We definitely nailed it with the Grey Dog. I had the egg white turkey, egg and spinach wrap and it was excellent. My coworker had biscuits and gravy and an omelette which all looked awesome as well - although I try to avoid food like that, it looked great. Service was top notch. Nice find."}
{"text":"Absolutely incredible food and service! Enjoyed the breakfast special and said yes to onions and green peppers on your home fries! Love their slogan so much, I'm taking a coffee cup back to Indiana!"}
{"text":"Loved it!  Stopped here because of other Yelp reviews and it was wonderful!  Nice people with good service.  Food was delicious and coffee was also very good.  My husband and I had the corned beef hash and it was exactly what we wanted.  The restaurant and the bathrooms were very clean and inviting.  Would definitely go back."}
{"text":"This place if a perfectly fine dinner, very clean with a nice staff and above average food, a good place to mix into your normal rotation"}
{"text":"Very friendly staff and service was excellent. Decor is nice. 

I got the healthy wrap which was good (if you like Turkey than try it. I'm usually not a turkey person but wanted to be healthy because it had tons of vegetables and used egg whites) but I hope to come back and try the corned beef. My boyfriend's gray dog wrap was better than mine. Got a side of hash browns/home fries to share between the two of us. Definitely more than enough did. They just needed a little more seasoning and flavor. 

I think I just didn't order the right things for this first trip. I am looking forward to my next trip."}
{"text":"Great. Went for Sunday brunch. They had all the standards and they were done very well. Friendly service and their corned beef was great. Definitely recommend if your looking for some good reasonably priced diner food"}
{"text":"Yum, yum, yum! Walking into this place, I could tell that the food was going to be good! It was really cutely decorated with Cleveland and Dog related pictures, but still had the vibe of a locally owned diner.  My sister and I went on a Sunday morning and it was definitely crowded! I wouldn't recommend coming at that time, unless you have plenty of time to spare.  The waitress we had was super attentive (our drinks were always full) and very helpful with explaining some items on the menu.  She told us that they are known for their corned beef, which was apparent after tasting the corned beef hash! It was really delicious, and so was the patty melt!  They actually have a full menu just for different types of loaded fries that they serve, I tried the garlic mayo with my french fries, which was a little disappointing because it didn't have a very garlicky flavor, but the other combinations looked pretty darn good.  I would definitely go back just so I could try something else on their huge menu!"}
{"text":"I like this diner.  They are always really friendly, whether you dine  in or take out. 

I really enjoy their breakfast sandwich (bacon, egg and cheese on a crossaint is my favortite combo). There is something about that simple sandwich made fresh on their grill that just tastes so good. It actually reminds me of this breakfast sandwich i had once in NYC that has stuck in my memory for years. Simple ingredients but so good. Yum. The bacon here is really  good quality. 

Their french fries with garlic aioli sauce is another favorite. Some of the best fries I've ever had. 

And last  but not least is the captain crunch french toast. Soo much better than regular french toast. And don't worry, you can still order it if you are over 12 years old. 

I always feel welcome here. And the price is right on."}
{"text":"Another good local spot in Lakewood! Sean and I tried this place out last week on a weekday morning. It's very rare that we have time to grab breakfast out on a weekday so we like to take advantage. 

This time we decided to try this new place across from St. Eds and were very pleased with our visit. The service was quick but not pushy and very friendly.  Coffee was never empty which is a must for a diner. I love the fresh, clean atmosphere of this diner. Very open feel to the place. I also love how the tables by the wall have hanging caddies for the sauces, menus, etc so the table doesn't feel so crowded (see pic). This is a great, simple idea that really can make a difference. 

Sean got the Huevos Rancheros and I tried the biscuits and gravy with a side of bacon. These are two staples for us when eating breakfast out so we have plenty to compare it with. Sean loved the HR - good sized portion and the ingredients very fresh. My biscuits, however, were not very rave-worthy. 

To me, the gravy should have lots of sausage in it but in very small pieces with a thick, creamy gravy so that the little bits of sausage are suspended in it. This stuff was too thin and the sausage way to big of chunks. It reminded me of a sloppy joe with tons of meat just sitting on the biscuits and the thin gravy soaking into the bread and puddling in the plate. Don't get me wrong - the flavor was good and the portion of meat way above average with good quality sausage. The overall texture and presentation just didn't work for me. 

The side of bacon was FANTASTIC though. Some of the meatiest, most well-cooked bacon I've ever had at a restaurant. Seriously impressed with how little fat there was on it. Very good.

Overall, definitely a fan of Gray Dog. We'll be back to try some of the other menu items."}
{"text":"Another great breakfast at this diner. Their eggs are the best around. Top quality, sourced for taste. Really a big difference. Coffee is solid and toast is real and not thin. Glad I stopped by for the quality ingredients. A cut above other diners."}
{"text":"Great neighborhood spot.  Staff is very friendly. Food is great.  We are particular fans of the sausage gravy."}
{"text":"The food & service is really good. It is a small place & a lil tight. Nonetheless, a great place to come for breakfast or lunch. They serve breakfast all day & that's a plus."}
{"text":"Friendly, fast service and classic, delicious breakfast food. The dining room is small, but I went around 11 on a Sunday and sat right down."}
{"text":"This is the best breakfast on the east end of Lakewood. The lunch menu looks great, too. Prices are very reasonable and the service is always friendly and usually prompt. 

The atmosphere is very nice. Always clean and tasteful. 

I've had omelets, the breakfast wrap, and it was always great. Their corned beef hash is out of this world. 

Eat breakfast here."}
{"text":"I just had the best Ruben sandwich I have ever eaten (coming from a German/Swiss, that's saying a lot).  The corned beef was fresh, moist and stacked 1.5\" high.  The Swiss cheese was delicious and perfectly melted.  And the bread--not too much butter, not soggy, really well toasted.  Anyone who likes Ruben sandwiches should come here.  

Oh, and the fries are delicious, too."}
{"text":"Great corner deli in Lakewood that's very reasonably priced. Serving quality food fast if you're in a hurry too, call your order on ahead & it's always ready in around 10 minutes. Fantastic place & great service, the owners are very friendly as well!!"}
{"text":"If I were to rate this place solely on the deliciousness of the breakfast sandwich (on a croissant) and the hashbrowns, it would be a 5. We come every weekend for them. 

And every weekend we wait 5-10 minutes for someone to bus one of the 5 dirty tables. We never get silverware, are always missing things from the table, and the spoons are usually dirty. In fact, I once received a soup spoon w/ my coffee w a thick glob of soup still on the bottom (yeah, disgusting). 

We always end up with the curly haired lady who is eternally flustered. Today we counted  8 employees working and 15 customers. And she paced back and forth past the dirty tables, nothing in hand, completely tweaking out. 

So the service and cleanliness (I was fooled before) get a 2. 

The servers are nice though, which goes a long way. And the coffee's ok."}
{"text":"Completely Average.  That sums it up for me.

Food was good but not great, nothing special about anything. The home fries are forgettable, the eggs classic but nothing great, the bacon the same.  

The wraps are uninspired, just a good old wrap.  The coffee somewhat thin and acidic.  So all in all, just pretty average.  To me, forgettable.  The whole experience lacked anything unique enough for me to really like.

That all being said, I can see the attraction to some.  Service was friendly above all else, the staff sing along to whatever station plays the most thoroughly overcooked pop 100 of the last 5 years.  The atmosphere is clean and organized, small but efficient.  It feels more like a self-inspired Panera knock-off motif than I expected.  Not your traditional breakfast counter and tiny booths (that I love).  Food is probably consistent and the AC was cranking. 

I guess what I'm saying is, if you're like me and you want unique locations, above average coffee and entertaining characters then this place isn't one of those.  If you're mostly in for a clean, safe, friendly and consistent meal then you'll probably love it here."}
{"text":"Great diner! Very clean and modern compared to the old, outdated, and dirty diners that you're usually accostomed to. The prices are very reasonable. The food is all homemade and exceptional. Get anything because you cannot go wrong! The service is well exceeding average. I love being here! Good work, Gray Dog Diner!!!"}
