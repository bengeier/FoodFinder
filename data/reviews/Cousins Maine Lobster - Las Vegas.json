{"text":"I really like this truck! I cant get enough, Lobster roll is amazing!! only down fall is the truck needs to be where the website says its going to be! I drive around to follow them a sometimes its not there!"}
{"text":"O.M.G. I was SHOCKED when I received my $17 Maine lobster roll. SMALL AS FUUUUUUUUU... don't waste your money PLEASE! Yelpers wanna say that lobster is expensive, so what do you expect? NO. I've had waaaaay bigger/more food for that price. For $17 and all the hype this truck gets, I was expecting to be impressed and this was the saddest sandwich I've ever had :("}
{"text":"The only reason I am giving it 3 stars is because the first time it was awesome.  Lobster roll was absolutely delicious.  Then I went to a food truck event at Knickerbocker Park and it was not great at all.  They told us it would be a half hour wait and it was probably 45 minutes.  No apologies for the long wait.  The lobster rolls looked like someone sat on the them and then they pried them open to add the lobster.  Not worth the $60 for 3 lobster rolls and soup.  They didn't seem prepared for the event at all."}
{"text":"Purchased a $17.00 lobster roll from the truck parked at Smith's in Henderson. I was very excited to try one since I saw you guys on Shark Tank. Wow, what a big disappointment, and after seeing photos of some of your other lobster rolls, I'm just mad. The roll I received looked nothing like those pictures. There was barely any lobster on the roll, and the lobster itself was tasteless!! I really didn't think it was worth $7 let alone $17. Never again."}
{"text":"Last night my wife and I watched a show on lobster rolls in Maine. We were craving lobster and thought it would be awesome to go to Cousin's Maine Lobster truck. We drove the 12 miles to get to it and we're simply excited. I ordered the Maine lobster roll, she ordered the lobster grilled cheese and we ordered the lobster tots and a whoopie pie to share. $60 later we got our food and hurried home to eat it. We got home and to my disappointment got a 2 bite roll with about the same amount of meat in it as 3 crawdads. You can see the length of it is about 4 inches. Now the lobster in it was good, don't get me wrong, but from the pictures and the just shy cost of $20, it was a major disappointment. The same went for my wive's grilled cheese. There was a small speed bump of lobster in the middle of the bread and that's it. One bite of lobster and the rest cheese. 

So the lobster tots were awesome. Crispy tots with a pico and lobster topping. That's about all I can get behind. Unfortunately I was hoping this was going to be a weekly stop since they are right by us every Saturday night. But oh well."}
{"text":"Best lobster rolls I've had in Nevada; both the Maine and Connecticut rolls are well worth their reasonable cost.  I love their clam chowder and lobster bisque too!  And I think I know good lobster rolls and chowder when I get them, after twenty+ years in Massachusetts.  Very pleasant people too.  Their truck is a \"can't miss\" for me whenever they come to the NW."}
{"text":"I discovered them at the Henderson Farmers Market on Eastern. I wasn't that hungry since I wasn't planning on eating anything at the market, but when I saw the truck...

I had been looking for a great lobsta roll for a very long time. King's Fish House has a large roll for $25 that didn't hit the spot with me. I ordered the Maine Lobster Roll. Yes, $15 is pricey, but it was worth it. Lobster meat was perfect...it had that cold water sweetness.

Service was fast and friendly."}
{"text":"Went to truck at art in the park in Boulder City.  Got lobster roll plenty of lobster and toast but not enough mayo!!!!  And the order taker was rude!!!!"}
{"text":"Not bad from a taste perspective. Not a huge Lobster connoisseur per se, but have had my share of Lobster and although good they are just to small for my liking. For 16 bones I want it to be the size of two of these at the least."}
{"text":"Haven't gotten into the groove of following Food Trucks...but you bet I'll be keeping my eyes and ears open for more of Cousins Maine Lobster.  On 12/6/17 I stepped out of the Smith's grocery store located at Valle Verde @ Paseo Verde in Henderson.  Curiosity of a line of folks standing in front of a food truck caught my attention. Lobster! Are you kidding? Maine Lobster and having hooked up with Barbara on Shark Tank.... well that's all it took to hook me in. I ordered the Lobster Taco and to my delight thoroughly enjoyed every bite! Fresh soft homemade taco shells layered with chunks of succulent fresh and sweet Lobster, shredded cabbage, homemade Pico de gallo,
A squirt of a light mayo sauce.  2 nice large slices of fresh limes accompanied the tacos. Squeezed just enough lime juice on each of the 3 tacos and enjoyed a feast of fresh homemade goodness!   I enjoyed the Lobster so much that I drove back to the Smith's parking lot and ordered a Maine Lobster Roll and Moon Pie to round out my dinner. The lobster was layered unto an incredible tasting toasted bread roll with just enough mayo so as not to disguise the flavour of the tender  sweet succulent lobster chunks. And the moon pie which was wrapped in its own packaging was an import from Maine appeared to have been frozen and the middle white fluff was in its thawing stage and still firm....had I been home I would have popped it into the microwave for a few seconds...but none the less the flavour of the chocolate cake and vanilla cream sandwiched in between were good old fashioned goodness and could easily serve 2 to 4 for dessert.
The price for the Lobster Taco $16.00
Maine Lobster Roll $17.00
Moon Pie $5.00
Which includes tax.
Was an expensive eat alone treat and well worth it!

I'm new to Yelp and trying to figure out how to add photos...."}
{"text":"Oh my goodness - we had the Connecticut Lobster Roll and it was delicious!  We will be back for more!"}
{"text":"Yum, this place is delish!  Had the Connecticut roll and lobster tots and they were both incredible.  I love the concept and the truck is very clean and super high tech!

For the yelpers complaining about the price, I just want to say that lobster does not come from Lake Mead, you can easily pay more for a trendy cup of coffee."}
{"text":"Visited Vegas from NYC. Got the Connecticut Roll and it was amazing, warm buttery goodness. I highly recommend."}
{"text":"Excited to see the Lobster Truck at Smiths today at 12:30. Checked out the menu waiting for the person in front of me to finish ordering. I step up and he says he can't take my order. He's leaving. What???  No explanation."}
{"text":"Quite possibly the most disappointing lobster roll I've ever had, combined with terrible customer service. They got our order wrong and when we asked them about the missing item, they brushed us off and said \"we didn't ring that up.\" Let me point out that there was no line at the time, so they could have easily corrected the issues. What they should have said was, \"We're sorry we missed that item. Would you like to order it?\"
On to the lobster roll- for $16 you get cold lobster with a squirt of mayo on toasted butter bread. It's ridiculously disappointing!"}
{"text":"The food was awesome.  Tasted great!

That's the 1 star. 

I subtracted the other 4 stars because, I waited 45 minutes for my single, lobster roll.   45 minutes in the Las Vegas sun...temperature was 104!!

$14 bucks for the lobster roll!  I'm not fat by any stretch of the imagination, but the serving size is only enough for a snack.  If your looking for a filling lunch from this truck, expect to pay $25+

As good as the food was, I'll never visit this truck again.  Seriously!  I don't enjoy standing in the heat for that freaking long!!"}
{"text":"Meh. I've waited a long time to try their lobster roll since I've seen it on shark tank so possibly I built it up too much. The lobster was good and a generous portion, but it was on one piece of bread that was folded over. I'm not sure if that's normal for a lobster roll but I would have liked it on a nice actual roll and with the lobster seasoned a little more. It wasn't bad but also not quite as good as I was expecting."}
{"text":"Fraud.    Stay away.   Bad. Bad. Bad !!!!  One bite and it's over.  Way way. Over priced.  The one bite is not even good."}
{"text":"One of the best lobster rolls I've ever had. Wow great experience.
I don't think it could of been any better. People complaining about the size for the price. I paid $16 dollars for the roll but what do you expect folks, it's lobster and lobster is market price. It's also lobster in the desert for crying out loud. Stop complaining. 
Seriously though I used to grow up near Maine and it brought back memories of my child hood."}
{"text":"I try the Connecticut lobster roll ..for the first time .
so disappointed .. lobster has no flavor .. nothing special ..  alot of marketing ..with the Shark tank thing ..sorry but
Would never come back again .."}
{"text":"Let me start out by saying that I've been waiting for months to eat from this particular truck! I keep missing it wherever fit goes and finally they are part of Total Wines Food Truck party every Thursday from 5-9, so I was happier than a pig in shit when I seen their truck. So today I stopped by and decided to try their lobster tacos. Ok, so it's lobster..I get how it would be expensive, so Im not going g to complain about the price..But on the quality I'm about to let loose like a mother of four in a night club.. IT WAS BAD. Rubbery. Tough. Bland. Portioned smaller than what I expected. Overcooked. Bland. Tough..Well you get the point. So I can say at least I tried it. I can also say I won't be back..:( BOO."}
{"text":"Excellent!!!  We had the lobster bisque, lobster rolls, and lobster tacos, and everything was delicious!!! This was the best lobster meal we have had in a very long time!  Highly recommend you try this."}
{"text":"I wish I could rate this a 3.5.  I don't want to rate it a 3 star because of how delicious the lobster was, but I didn't want to rate it a 4 because of the price.  So I'm rounding up.  I would recommend pairing a sandwich with the regular tots to make it worth spending almost $20.  

You get a pretty good portion of regular potato tots for the price.  I overheard someone complaining about the portion of the lobster tots (and those were about 3x the price), so I definitely would not order those.

If prices were lower, I would go back."}
{"text":"This is food truck, so you have to check their website every week to see where they're going to be. But once you find it, yummyyyyyyyyyy!. I had the lobster roll and fries. The roll was incredible!! It was well worth the price. Although pricing looks a little steep, I found that it was the same as lobster shacks back east. Definitely a hidden gem!!"}
{"text":"No frills lobster roll sandwich. Mayo and as much lobster meat they can stuff in a hot dog bun. $17. On the northeast corner of las Vegas Boulevard and Fremont Street in Downtown."}
{"text":"Great lobster rolls! Tried the Connecticut Lobster roll and lobster tots and they were delicious! I saw the food truck on my way home from work one night and told myself I would track it down on my day off.  Took just a minute to look them up and drove across town to try them. The lobster roll was loaded with tons of buttery lobster with a wedge of lemon. The tots again loaded with tons of lobster, tomatoes, onions and sauce. Some people complained about the price, but you get so much lobster that the price is well worth it!"}
{"text":"We had the warm lobster with butter and tater tots. That was the best lobster sandwich we've ever had! It was fresh, juicy, buttery sand the bread and tots were crispy."}
{"text":"Amazing! Connecticut Lobster roll. Perfect temperature, perfect amount of butter and lemon!"}
{"text":"It was amazing and lived up to my expectations...
I grew up in Maine and for me Maine has some of the best food in the world.
I had the lobsta roll and a whoopie pie for $19.50
They are parked in different places each week so follow them online so you 
don't miss out !!!
GREAT FOOD, GREAT SERVICE !!!!
THANKS GUYS"}
{"text":"Was very excited on trying this and when I saw the truck in the Smith's parking lot, I jumped at the chance to try one of my favorite meals, the Lobster Roll. After much fanfare, I was very disappointed. I had them wrap it to take home so I understand that buns get soggy in a takeout environment. That being said, my home is only 5 minutes away.
Soggy bun that was also greasy and not fresh. Lobster tasted as if had been washed since it had very little taste. It also looked as if there wasn't much care taken when picking the meat from the shell. The presentation was also very poor.  Adding in the price of this meal, it was a total failure."}
{"text":"This is by far the greatest lobster I've ever tasted. Every bite gets better and better. I've told everyone I know and don't know how delicious and utterly fantastic Cousins Maine Lobster Truck is in Las Vegas. Located in the heart of Downtown Fremont, this experience is truly a must-eat! I'd give you 6 stars if I could!"}
{"text":"Taste so good makes you wanna slap yo momma! I tried their food at a community event and had the longest line! I wanted to know what the commotion was about, I ordered a Connecticut Roll, which is warm lobster and Butter, waited promptly 10 minutes to the best amazing perfectly cooked lobster roll! And man are they hustling in there!! I wish restaurants could learn from them."}
{"text":"Had the lobster tacos from the truck on Fremont. They were good, especially with the sauce on the side."}
{"text":"I have been waiting for a cousins Maine lobster truck to open in Vegas. All I can say is wow what a great concept and great food. I had the Connecticut lobster roll today and it was 5 star. I am from the east coast and I did grow up on Maine lobster and this is about as authentic and fresh as your gonna get. I wish these guys good luck and you will be seeing me pretty often.

Also I was impressed with the cleanliness of the truck. The person running the truck said the truck was completely brand new and not an old truck with fresh paint."}
{"text":"This is probably the worst lobster roll I have had in my life. Don't waste your money $17, just kind of a joke.   The lobster was over cooked and was like chewing bubblegum."}
{"text":"14 dollars for about 3 ounces of chewy rubbery lobster claws that were very likely frozen; it's not hard to get fresh lobster in this town then at least the bill would be worthwhile. I can say though that service was friendly."}
{"text":"Okay. It's a food truck. In front of a grocery store. It's lobster. It's expensive. It's delicious. The lobster roll was chock full of lobster and drenched in butter. The soup was a small portion for the price. If you're not into taking chances (culinary speaking) steer clear. Not a place to take the kids unless you've money to burn. But if you're wanting a treat before or after shopping - treat yo'self. But bottom line.............................it tastes good."}
{"text":"I was somewhat disappointed; but I didn't grow up in the Northeast so take my review with a grain of salt.

I was pretty excited that a lobster roll food truck was going to arrive in Vegas and I had planned with a couple friends to go. Obviously I'm aware that lobster isn't the cheapest thing on the market, but their lobster rolls were $14/ea, which was higher than the price offered at their LA trucks. As lobster rolls traditionally are, this included lobster meat piled on a hot dog bun. Tasty, but just not the Vegas portions I'm used to. I got a side of plain tots which were $4. They were fine. I just knew I was going to need more food in addition to the small roll but didn't want to make this food-truck equally as expensive as going to a half-decent sit-down restaurant by purchasing another lobster-garnished dish.

My friend asked if the $12 lobster tots were large enough to be a dish on their own. \"Yeah they are huge!\" When she received hers she immediately knew it wasn't going to be enough food. It was the just side of tater tots with some lobster on the top.

This will probably be popular with people that moved here from the Northeast, though."}
{"text":"I'm constantly checking their schedule every week to see where they will be.. so it is hit or miss but i would have to say this is my go-to for lobster rolls! Great quality & thats the expensive price you pay for."}
{"text":"They were at Southern Hills Hospital, the line was long and they were super slow. Some people spent their entire lunch break waiting on their food order. I bought multiple rolls and asked for a bag and the guy seemed annoyed I had the nerve to ask for a bag. They also don't give you napkins and if you ask it too appears to bother them. They guys were somewhat rude, the rolls were small. I wouldn't waste my time with them."}
{"text":"Worth it and recommend it.

Try Main Lobster Roll

And also for dessert Classic Wicked Whoopi Pie"}
{"text":"I've been to this food truck twice, each time was during First Friday. The second time though, I came early around 5:30pm. There was barely a line and, once again, the lobster melted in my mouth. I loved every bite!"}
{"text":"Surprised my live with this food truck. He is a die hard lobster fan. This hit the spot. We shared tacos and a lobster roll. That was so delicious. Next time I hope they are ready...30 tacos to go! I will now be a regular here and try checking in at least once a week!"}
{"text":"I fell in love from my very first bite.  I ordered the Connecticut lobster roll, and tater tots; the lobster roll was delicious, moist, and full of flavor.  Tater tots were average. However, I have to give them 3 starts only, because twice I went to their scheduled location, and the truck was not there, and I called them twice to inquire about the location that they posted on their website, the phone just rang, they don't even have voice mail or an answering machine.  This tells me, they lack organization and don't seem to care about their customers.  Basically, its like having an open sign in a restaurant window, but the restaurant is always closed.  Where is Barbara Corcoran, from the Shark Tank?"}
{"text":"I had the lobster tots. They were okay and they were pretty pricey. I might try them again if I'm not in a hurry the wait is terribly long."}
{"text":"They were at the Foodie Fest and there was a line however it was not worth the wait or the price. It costs 16.00 and I was totally prepared to spend. The big disappointment was they were only four bites with no real taste of anything. Not my idea of a SHARK TANK suggestion. I won't suggest it or follow this one. They need to add flavor and more lobster to make this a real delicacy for the asking price."}
{"text":"Connecticut lobster roll to die for. I could easily eat 3!  A split-top bun, griddled in butter, filled with cold lobster dressed with a touch of mayonnaise. #infoodtruckheaven"}
{"text":"If you are a foodie like myself, you need to try this new Food Truck in Vegas!!!  They came to our office today and my co-worker and I went back to try additional items!!!  We enjoyed EVERYTHING we ordered.  Lobster Tacos, Lobster Tater Tots, Lobster Quesadilla, and the Lobster Bisque was amazing!!!  I even tried the Lobster Ice Cream and couldn't believe how good it was.  This truck is amazing, the staff is top notch and I will definitely have them back!!!  Over 100 of our employees tried it and couldn't stop talking about how good everything was!!!  Thanks guys you were fabulous!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I was excited to try this place out since hey it's lobster and saw the sign saying they were on Shark Tank. Boy was I mistaken!! Yes it is expensive and yes it is a small portion but the quality was mediocre at best, not what I was expecting. If that wasn't bad enough about an hour after eating it I got horribly sick and had to spend my night in the hospital with food poisoning!!! Not only did they effect my health but since I'm pregnant this could have effected my unborn child. Stay away!!!!"}
{"text":"$18 lobster Sammich! It was puney. Pricey. But boy.... It was delish. Ask me if I would buy it again..... Nope!

That Whoopie pie was legit though. Two thumbs up"}
{"text":"I had an lobster roll and lobster bisque...they were  both delicious and worth the price.  I  will definitely go back."}
{"text":"BOMB????? warm roll with lemon butter is soooooooo good and bread wasn't soggy. 

Service was fast also, didn't eat the lobster tots but they looked delicious"}
{"text":"Great spot to get a lobster role or a lobster bisque! If you're not here, you're missing out. Thank you for coming to Vegas!"}
{"text":"I love this food truck. Me and my wife always end up where this truck is and we love it. Awesome lobster roll."}
{"text":"Okay...the lobster is delicious. Buttery and tender. Some of the best lobster I've ever had (from a lunch truck). The roll was soft and warm. My one huge issue is the price. I paid roughly $17 for a lobster roll that was basically the size of a supermarket hot dog bun. No exaggeration. I could have eaten it in 2 bites, but stretched it into 3 because I couldn't bear to pay $6.50 a bite. When they handed it to be I actually asked for my money back, but was refused. Seriously overpriced. Stay away."}
{"text":"Finally trekked across town to try the lobster roll and I wasn't disappointed. I got the CT lobster roll and the lobster tater tots and couldn't get enough. Will definitely have them again."}
{"text":"Are there better lobster rolls in the world? Yes. Does this do the job of satisfying a lobstah craving while drinking on Fremont Street? Yessiree bob. 

I love lobster. I love sandwiches. Therefore, lobster rolls are just like two of my all-time favorite things wrapped into one amazing piece of deliciousness. I was ECSTATIC to find this truck on a night where my fiance and I decided to stroll fremont street. I promptly said to him, \"this. this is what's for dinner. I need this.\" I perused through the yelp reviews and they are understandably mixed. I mean, lobster rolls are pricey and when you dish out 16 bucks for a sandwich, I'm sure we all expect it to be amazeballs. I went for it anyway, though, cuz...GIMME THAT LOBSTA.

Service? Fine. It's a truck. There wasn't a line but it was also a Monday night. We ordered two Maine lobster rolls (they also have Connecticut rolls for you blasphemers) and devoured them with the extreme quickness. Lobster was juicy and tender; mayo was ample but not too crazy. They provide a lemon wedge but we decided to live on the edge and went sans lemon. Did I feel like it was absolutely worth the dough? Maybe not. Did I feel disappointed? Absolutely not. Would def do again.

Other menu items included lobster grilled cheese (really was tempted to try this bad boy out), lobster quesadilla, and lobster tots! Those looked delish but I couldn't rationalize the price point of tater tots with lobster (something like 16 bucks as well).  All in all - not a bad truck experience."}
{"text":"Woah ! Am am still dreaming of this lobster roll. If it was legal in Australia I would take it home, make it my bride and treat it like a princess."}
{"text":"I split a cold and a warmed lobster roll with a buddy. Great tasting lobster, both equally good. A little pricey for the modest size ($18 each). Wished it were bigger."}
{"text":"Just forced down a lobster roll and lobster bisque from this truck today. This is my 4th time eating at Cousins and it was a struggle to finish both items. My first two times the lobster rolls were good. Third time was eh! This time was total garbage-old and tough The truck was late (not the first time) and we were asked to wait for 10 minutes. O K, they have to set up. After about 10-15 minutes they started up the truck, pulled out of the Smiths parking lot and went to the nearby gas station!! They stayed there and came back about 20-25 minutes later! We ordered two Connecticut rolls and lobster bisque. I'm from New England and have eaten 100+ lobsters and lobster rolls. Canned lobster tastes better than what we purchased. This was NOT fresh. Tasted like it was cooked 1-2 days ago. Maybe they had some left over from yesterday and we got it because we were the first customers? The lobster bisque was uneventful also. That's it for me. Can't afford to piss away $45 for mediocre food. I'm going to try Lobster Me next time I'm in the mood for lobstah. Shameful."}
{"text":"It is a little more on the expensive side for the size you are getting but the roll was the best one I've ever had so it is definitely worth the money. I would highly recommend trying the food."}
{"text":"The Lobster Rolls are so amazing, and I'm starting to feel like a stalker chasing this truck all over the city!  This is what lobster is SUPPOSED to taste like!  Yum, yum, yum!

I tried Cousins Maine Lobster for the first time during the Farmers Market at Tivoli Village, and I was completely blown away.  The \"regular\" old Lobster Rolls are where it's at!  I tried the tacos and tots for the heck of it, but nothing is as perfect to me as the basic Maine Lobster Roll.  The portion of lobster meat is great, the roll is perfect and delicious, and the lobster meat is so succulent, fresh, and sweet.  All it needs is a little squeeze from the lemons provided, and you are golden!  Don't get me wrong, it's fun to try all the menu variations, but I think the simplicity of the Maine Lobster Roll is the best.

Tips: The truck has a beautiful, \"A\" rating from the health department posted right in the front window - score!, it accepts debit/credit cards in addition to cash, the customer service is friendly, the wait time is very reasonable (we had an $80 order and it took about 10 minutes), and the prices are fair.  Also, they have a Facebook page for the Las Vegas truck, and you can find the menu with prices posted."}
{"text":"I was a huge fan of this company after having seen it on SHARK Tank and per that expected there be no dam way the quality could be bad but I was dead wrong there. Even living in Vegas you can get quality seafood but it usually entails dining in the very overpriced strip. I was psyched when I heard this food truck was going to be part of the several that swing by my corporate office building. Dealt with the rediculous  $15 pricing for a good truck however woukd have been fine if it had been worth it for quality seafood especially lobster. Split a bunch of stuff with coworkers including lobster rolls and tacos. Everything was horrible and I am still baffled by it. The rolls were 90% bread to 10% lobster and the tacos we even more of a joke. They literally had some slaw thrown on as the majority and had lobster buts literally sprinkled on as if they were flecks from a can of tuna. I had to have lunch somewhere else after as most of my office did who tried them out too. Have never been so underwhelmed in trying out food in Vegas to say the least. I think it's pathetic that a company especially being in a nation show with a shark invested could manage to grow to the point they have with locations and trucks all over the country yet habe absolutely no quality control. How the he'll is that being successful and it is absolutely a crime they have the nerve to charge the beyond above average food truck pricing they do for this kind of crap quality and portions. It has made me never even consider trying their more \"legit\" locations in other states if this is how they run their business, like other typical franchises. Save your money as an understatement, in Vegas anyways!"}
{"text":"I've been waiting awhile to try this famous lobster. It was mediocre at best. It wasn't bad, it wasn't good, it was basically there. The only thing left hurting was my wallet. Way overpriced!"}
{"text":"All I can say is I want more!!  This food truck is amazing.  I love lobster and eat it as often as I can, and I gotta say the quality is on the same level as a high end fine dining restaurant ( without the cost of course). I had the lobster tacos and the lobsters tots.  The salsa in top was very delicious, with the cabbage slaw adds a great crunch. I loved the texture. I must say it is hard to find a perfect tater tots, as most are either not crispy enough or burned, but their lobster tots were perfect.  I want more as I am writing this ....."}
{"text":"Yummy!!! My favorite is the Connecticut Lobster Roll, lemon butter sauce=amazing! I downloaded the app so I can follow them all around town. Everything on their menu looks delicious. Can't wait to try it all."}
{"text":"Caught up with CML Truck at the Henderson Farmers Market.  We ordered a Connecticut Lobster Roll, Shrimp Tacos and Lobster Bisque.  My favorite was the Connecticut Roll.  It was packed full of meat and delicious.  The bisque was also good, very rich.  The shrimp tacos I didn't care for.  Not bad just don't compare to the lobster rolls.  I would love to see them add lobster mac n cheese or lobster grilled cheese to the menu or as a daily special."}
{"text":"Went here last first Friday and the lobster tacos were mighty delicious! Lobster tots are bombtastic! Will return. Thank you to all staff and cooks!"}
{"text":"I've been eyeing this for a while so today I decided to indulge! Unfortunately it was a complete let down. The roll is tiny AF for the price and I wouldn't have mind the portion and price if it was actually good. Not worth the hype in my opinion. Maybe the grilled cheese won't be a let down. If I ever come again I hope the grilled cheese is good."}
{"text":"The lobster itself was cooked perfectly, but the \"touch of mayo\" was actually a huge amount and it overpowered everything about the roll. I upgraded to a meal with a whoopie pie, which was prepackaged and tasted like it had been previously frozen. I wrongly assumed it would have been fresh and homemade like the lobster roll.

I had been looking forward to trying this place since I saw them on Shark Tank a couple of years ago, but for now I'll stick with Luke's Lobster for my Vegas lobster rolls."}
{"text":"Saw them driving down the street one day and looked them up on Facebook. Checked out their schedule... waited until the weekend to give them a try... 
So worth the wait.. I told my husband I was bringing lunch and went a little crazy on the order. I got two lobster rolls. I had asked for Maine, but discovered they were Connecticut - still outstanding. A bowl of Lobster Bisque and the Lobster Tacos.
 Too much food, but oh so good... Was not able to finish it all, even sharing it with our daughters too. 
Lobster rolls & tacos were great. The Lobster Bisque was more cream with a sea taste, then a lobster taste and chunks of lobster.  
Check out their FB page to get their schedule, you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"First food truck experience and wow, was I disappointed. I saw this lobster truck in front of Smith's when I pulled in and since I hadn't had lunch thought I'd give it a try. At  $17 per lobster roll I thought it was a bit steep, but what do I know about lobster rolls, right? No bueno. The bread was excellent, buttery and toasty, but the lobster.... chewy, chewy, chewy. And even though I had ordered the warm roll, certain bites were cold in the middle. I gave 2 stars because of the bread and the staff was really friendly. But I think I'll pass next time."}
{"text":"Tried today at the Foodie Fest in Henderson. I paid $15 for a lobster quesadilla that was all cheese and grease and no lobster. I could have saved $13 and got a cheese quesadilla from Del Taco and been just have unsatisfied."}
{"text":"I been to Maine and this is the same food. I could eat there everyday if my heart could handle it."}
{"text":"Okay yes it's a food truck, and located near Fremont Street in downtown Las Vegas...  but it was 10:30pm and its lobster!

I've seen them on TV and around town, but never tried it before.  I went for the Maine Lobster Roll - $17!  A few minutes later, after interesting people watching and I have a lobster roll served with a slice of lemon.  The bread they used was awesome, but the huge chunks of lobster was great!  Worth the high price - we'll sort of (did I mention I was hungry and walking back to the parking garage when I saw the truck?).  Anyway the amount of lobster, as well as the quality was very good!

Not an ideal place to stand around in a Friday night to wait for food - but hey, I was still glad I did!

FYI - they move the truck around town during the week; so you don't necessarily have to venture downtown to find them!"}
{"text":"I was passing by the Smith's shopping center on Buffalo last Monday and noticed on the CML Website that they would be there from 9-5. I have wanted to try these  guys since I love lobster rolls and found out they franchised here. I got there around 10:30 to find the truck closed. I went into the store to pick up a few things and when I got out they were opened. So I walked up and was about to place my order when the guy told me he has not gotten his credit card machine working yet and If I wanted something I had to pay cash or wait. When I asked him how long the wait was he said he didn't know how long it would be. So I got cash and ordered one Maine roll, one Connecticut roll and a small lobster bisque. He quoted me $43 when in fact it should have been $42. He mumbled something about he thought the soup was $9 and not $8 . When I finally got the food I took it home to share with my wife. Surprisingly when I took it out of the bag it turned out that it was two Connecticut rolls and no Maine one.  We each had a roll and split the soup. The only reason this is a 2 star review and not a one star is the fact that while the portions are small for the price, (Las Vegas has the highest prices of any franchise city) the food is excellent. I also sent an email to the owner about the issue and a week later I still have had no response. Service is everything and sadly I will not be going back to this excellent food because of the very poor service. I rather give my money to someone who deserves it."}
{"text":"This foodie truck is very well done and the idea is awesome. I had to give them a try. The lobster roll was just OK ; I must say I wasn't expecting the Lobster Roll to cost $17.00 ,but I paid it because I'd heard so many good things about the food. The next time I will be sure to ask before just ordering; I would have expected about $9.00 for this lobster roll. Will I try it again ? Not likely, the lobester was a bit too chewy."}
{"text":"First time tasting a lobster roll from Cousin's Maine Lobster.  Considering I've eaten 10 times today already.....It was really good considering. 


Very Good Service Too!"}
{"text":"Being from Cape Cod, and having a fisherman for a father, I miss the fresh seafood I grew up eating desperately! I think I have tried every lobster roll place in Vegas, and nobody compares to Cousins! If your from New England, you know the roll has to be toasted! Also, you get a good portion of meat in the roll.  The lobster tasted fresh and delicious! We love Cousins and will track down their food truck all over Vegas! If for some reason the truck is not where at the location specified on their website, just give Jimmy a call! (The phone number in Yelp) He will resolve any issue you may have and make sure you have a great experience!  Also, Polo the cook was awesome! Super friendly and professional! We had such a great lunch! 
Thank you Jimmy for such outstanding customer service!
I wish you guys much success!"}
{"text":"Delicious!!!!!  The lobster sandwiches are unbelievable. And they get them out to you quick. We've always had an amazing experience with cousins Maine lobster."}
{"text":"I have noticed this food truck several times on Fremont East but finally tried it during Third Thursday on Third! Very glad I did- absolutely delicious lobster, better than any I have ever had before, and I am a big lobster fan! 
Only reason I am giving 4 stars is the set-up of the truck- the order window is very high (I am only 5'0, but even taller people were struggling) and the truck (generator?) was very loud, which makes it difficult to communicate with the server. A heads up is they do take a bit to make your order.
But again, the food is worth the wait and worth every penny (it's pricey but not too much more than other food trucks- and it's Maine lobster!) and I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Such a disappointment 
Almost $20 for a lobster roll and it's so tiny !! 
We get it lobster isn't cheap but damn that serving size is very stingy for the cost. Lobster was over cooked making it hard. Not worth it ...."}
{"text":"Just went to try Cousins Maine Lobster food truck at Top Shelf wine & Spirits. Got the Connecticut lobster roll, a bit pricey, and the first bite was like chewing a rubber band. Lobster way over cooked. Wife got the lobster taco's and they were the same. She had one bite and could not eat the rest. With all the hype you would think they could cook a lobster. Maybe most people don't know a good lobster from a over cooked one. Was going to take them back and get a refund but my wife talked me out of if cause she did not want me to start trouble. Maybe the Maine Lobster guys need to come and show the Las Vegas truck how to do it right."}
{"text":"Ordered the $16 lobster grilled cheese sandwich.  Kinda expected something a little more flavorful, don't get me wrong, it was good, like a good grilled cheese sandwich.  Tried it, liked it, but didn't blow me away for $16.  A-Ok."}
{"text":"Have eaten here a few times.  Other than their prices just being too high for what you get...the food is good.  I had both the lobster rolls and the lobster tacos.  The rolls we're excellent but could use more lobster, especially for $16.  The tacos were Ok...not worth it in my opinion. 
The whoopie pie, I could do without.  It was like $4 and just not worth it
   My only complaints are...they obviously are over priced..,they seem to not have stock of chips and sodas when I have gotten food from them...but maybe that is good consider how expensive the small bag of chips cost :). Lastly, I ordered for multiple people.  All food came in one bag and nothing was labeled....so here we had to open everything and dig around to see who's was who's.  
   All said and done, I love lobster rolls...but at $16 each...there are other places in town that sell good/better for the same or cheaper and have more side options."}
{"text":"I grew up in the Boston area.  Thought I  would give them a try. Sorry to say I have had better rolls at McDonald's when they occasionally have them. It was over priced,  tiny and I am not sure if it was real lobsta.
Anybody who gave them a high rating probably has never had a \"Real lobsta roll\""}
{"text":"So good such a good lobster roll but really expensive. I don't like how its 16 dollars for a lobster tail but it was worth it. I wanted another..."}
{"text":"This was my first time ordering and eating here! I was at work in my busy Er and they communicated with me to make sure I got what I wanted and DELIVERED it to me after they closed because I couldn't get away from work!! The lobster was great tasting and went well on the garlic roll!!!"}
{"text":"First time experience to the cousins Maine lobster truck.. it was so yummy !! Lobster tail and tots!! Can't beat it .. fast service !! And again yummy food !!!"}
{"text":"Cool to experience a Shark Tank story. I remembered watching this episode!! I am not a lobster fan- but I liked it!! Cooked to perfection. I like that they had different options for the lobster. We got the lobster roll."}
{"text":"The wors, cold and overally priced, little meat. Service could have been a little more pleasant."}
{"text":"Connecticut Roll---amazing!!  A little pricey--but considering it is lobster--I have no problem paying for it!  The rolls are small but the lobster meat is so rich that one roll is plenty. We tried the lobster tater tots and they were great."}
{"text":"I was kind of disappointed about the food we ordered the lobster grilled cheese and while the lobster was really good and fresh but the cheese was not melted which sucked just felt like a lobster squished sandwich. Definitely not worth $16"}
{"text":"So disappointed in the Lobster tots.  I was thinking i would be getting something original but what i got was some frozen Ore Ida tator tots I have in my freezer with lobster chucks on top.  The reason they got a 2 star cause the lobster was actually really good.  No originally in this dish."}
{"text":"They are set up at the end of the Fremont Street Experience on the other side of Las Vegas Bl. It's a small trailer not sure what their hours are but we stopped by to get a lobster grilled cheese sandwich it was yummy I'd get that again for sure. It is pricey as everything else on the menu but I think it was worth it heck it's Vegas everything is pricey lol no more 2 dollar steak and eggs deals lol or 99 cent jumbo shrimp cocktails times have definitely changed from the old school Vegas days lol. Overall I'd come back to this one."}
{"text":"I have never had your food until today.....AMAZING! You guys are very prompt and fast. The Lobster Bisque is by far the best I've had!"}
{"text":"I was glad to see this truck at First Friday and not have a crazy line of people in it. My wife and I decided to split a lobster roll and later realized we should have ordered one each. The lobster was definitely flavorful but that's where the excitement ended. The grilled bun was soggy than it should have been a very small. Yes the lobster to bun ratio was in favor of the lobster but that's not saying much with this tiny bun."}
{"text":"While there are many locations in Vegas and around the country, the newest one is in Centennial Hills at the newly opened Smith's Marketplace.

While the brick and mortar location inside isn't quite ready, the truck is parked outside from 11am-8pm daily. The entire menu revolves around lobster, the two most popular items are their lobster rolls. Priced at $17 a pop, you get to choose either the Maine Lobster Roll(CHILLED maine lobster and mayo on toasted New England style roll) or Connecticut Lobster Roll(WARM maine lobster and drawn butter on a New England style roll. 

If rolls aren't your thing, there's soups, tater tots,  tacos, and quesadillas too. Great spot to grab a bite after you get your shopping done. Try Cousin's Maine Lobster out if you haven't already. ALOHA!!!

{"text":"On a good day, it's amazing, and a full 5 stars. On a bad day, it can be 1 star.  On average then, it is overall a 3-star joint.

On a good day, the lobster is succulent, rich, and the bread, warm, toasty, and a great foil for the lobster.

On a bad day, the lobster is shriveled up, dry, and rubbery (overcooked), and the bread soggy and water-logged, and too oily. 

All depends on the day and the person making it in the truck. Quite a crap shoot. But hey, you're in Vegas! Give it a try."}
{"text":"Lobster roll way good but Very disappointed the lobster rolls was way to small for the price. :( will not come back here."}
{"text":"It was okay...and for $17 I want great! A little to much butter, it made my lovely toasted bun soggy"}
{"text":"Went here on a whim while on vacation. Best $20 i have spent on food truck food! We were a group of 8 and all 8 of us loved the food so much we tried to make it back the very next morning before our flight out! I swear it was the Best Lobster Grilled Cheese I have ever had. My friends are from the East coast and they couldn't believe how good the lobster meat was. In all, we had the Lobster roll, Lobster Quesadilla, Lobster Grilled Cheese, Lobster Tacos, a Connecticut Roll and Lobster tots....we truly ordered just about everything on the menu!

They are a little pricy but everything is cooked to order with all real ingredients, so we didn't mind. I wish they had a spot in the airport and a truck here in Chicago because I would be a faithful customer!

The customer service was great as well! The guy on the truck, Andre, was great. He talked to us and really is the reason we bought so much food...he takes pride in his company, the truck and the food. Great experience!"}
{"text":"Connecticut girl searching for a taste of home....found it on Cousins Maine Lobster truck. The hot, buttered Connecticut roll is my favorite. The Whoopie Pie brought memories of my mother's baking. Thank you so much! Get the App and follow them around!"}
{"text":"We were excited to finally try this world renowned place, but it was very disappointing. The lobster was decent, but tasted no better than what you'd get at Red Lobster, Joe's Crab Shack or Crab Corner. We paid $30 for a lobster roll and tacos. The tacos were good, but there wasn't much lobster on them. I can get better tacos from a cart in north town for $5. The lobster roll was a handful of lobster on bread and that's it. Can you put some sauce or veggies or something for goodness sake?? 

Plain. Boring. Over priced. No thanks...won't be eating there again. I don't know how they got so famous."}
{"text":"Tried the Maine lobster roll. I don't usually eat any type of seafood, but it was decent. My husband loves lobster though so we this is mostly his review. The sandwich size was really small for the price. Don't think we'd go back, it was overpriced."}
{"text":"Walking around Downtown Las Vegas, we came across this Lobster Truck!  Mmm!  Lobstah!!!

It was on the corner of Fremont and Las Vegas Blvd.  So convenient!

We paid $17 for a Lobster Roll.  There are 2 types:

Connecticut is served warm and has butter and Maine is served cold and has mayonnaise.

On my second visit, I brought Dear Daniel with me. We shared a Maine Lobster Roll...so yummy with large chunks of fresh lobster!

This food truck is within walking distance from the hotel that we frequent, so I'll probably be back!"}
{"text":"Horrible customer service. We showed up at 12:30 when their website said they would be at Smith's from 11:00-7:00 and were turned away. There was literally one person in front of us who placed an order and no one behind us, yet when we tried to place an order we were told they were \"leaving\". We asked if they could take one last order and were told \"no we are leaving\". Don't post hours if you refuse to serve customers during those hours."}
{"text":"I was excited to try Cousin's famous lobster roll after seeing them on Shark Tank, I wasn't too impressed.
Reasons being for $16 I got a small Sandwich littlery the size of a slice of bread although it did have plenty of lobster. Bread was soggy not toasted and didn't taste any butter nor did they include a lemon. Maybe I'll give them a 2nd chance,"}
{"text":"The BEST ever!! Love the Maine Lobster rolls! Absolute must try.... Then you will be hooked! 
Always good service and good food! If I could give them 10 stars I would!!! Love love love!!"}
{"text":"What you see is NOT what you get. Tried them at Wine Amplified on the strip. The picture of their lobster taco looks great. What you get isn't anything like the picture. The lobster is like the game hide and seek. The lobster won because we could not to find it nor taste it!  For 18 dollars I felt ripped off!"}
{"text":"So disappointed. Left a review for this business and they responded. (I can respect that.) They offered to have me try again to improve my dining experience. (I can respect that. Maybe it was a bad day.) I responded to the email they left me and thanked them for caring about the opinions of their customers as well as offering for me to try again. I told them, luckily, my friend from Boston was in town and he would be an even better expert at the proper taste of a lobstah roll. This was on October 6th. It is now October 15th. I have not received a response to their response and offer. Disappointed....again X2. 
But, that's ok. Still on my quest to find the proper lobstah roll and clam chowdah in this town if it kills me! Keeping hope alive!"}
{"text":"Anything more than a two star is the lie. I am sorry to be blunt and I am a big fan of shark tank. This is the only reason why I chose to stop at this establishment. I was asked whether I wanted the Connecticut lobster or the Maine lobster, which was a clear confusion for me. I chose the main lobster and discovered this was served cold on a roll that was not satisfactory. I also ordered The lobster tacos and they were sub par. I paid $40 for a meal of two and feel like I was gypped. This was because of the quality not because of the quantity. I was not expecting a humongous meal. I was expecting great quality, which I did not receive. Barbara Cochran of shark tank needs to set in place quality control her for these food trucks. This one specifically is not up to standards. I do not recommend you spend your money on this food truck. Please walk 40 feet from this establishment and enjoy perfectly plated me for half the price."}
{"text":"This lobster truck is so disappointing I had to write a yelp review. First the lobster rolls are $17!!! And then you receive a roll that comes on basically a dinner roll. What a sham this place is. Not to mention the fact that the roll itself is bland. Total waste of money!!! Seriously. I cannot express my utter disappoint in this place and what I received for paying $36 - receiving two tiny bland lobster rolls. Imagine if they would have brought this product on Shark Tank????? Here try this $17 bland lobster roll that isn't fresh and is so small you can eat the entire thing in one bite!!! Mark Cuban would have laughed hysterically, as that's all I could do when I unwrapped it. 


Never again."}
{"text":"Very underwhelmed. I was so excited to try them, and hadn't had a good lobster roll in a long time. The boss was buying, otherwise I'd be totally pissed at what I got as compared to the price. I got the Maine roll and it was soooo tiny! The lobster was fresh, but had absolutely no flavor: just meat on a glorified hot dog bun with a tiny squirt of mayo. $8-10...? Sure, but $22 for a tiny roll and tater tots is damn near criminal. Id give them 4 stars for the basic quality and a fresh product to work with, but 1 star for execution and value. Don't bother."}
{"text":"Not bad... The rolls are pretty good, I think a little overpriced considering we're in Vegas and we have a bast option of good quality and fresh seafood."}
{"text":"Had this place bookmarked for a while and I was super stoked to see that they were going to be at Life is Beautiful. 

Surprisingly, the price was the same that I paid for when I was in Maine, so really I hope people are not deterred by the price.  The roll was maybe about an inch smaller than what I experienced on the east coast. 

I got the Connecticute lobster roll. Good pieces of lobster and I thoroughly enjoyed it. I only wished that they had lemon juice for squeezing on it."}
{"text":"We came to the freemont experience and tried this place out he lobster tots is what my husband got he loved it"}
{"text":"Every time I try something new, I look for the next best thing. Nothing can compare to Cousins Maine Lobster. I had the Connecticut roll and the lobster tots. I have their website bookmarked in my phone to find where they will be at next. I highly recommended you try their food truck. The quality is amazing as well as the customer service. I usually need fine dining when I want good quality lobster but their food truck is even better and inexpensive! :-)"}
{"text":"I'm sorry but this is over hyped, or maybe by looking at the pictures on yelp, I had new workers who didn't know what they were doing.  I paid 30 dollars for  lobster tacos and a lobster roll.  There are two types of lobster roll one served cold with mayo and one served warm with garlic butter on it.  We opted for the warm version.

  First of all the pics on yelp of the lobster roll appeared to have more lobster than mine did. The tacos I  really had to search, it would be laughable if I hadn't paid so much. There were also multiple pieces of shell in them, which is a bit of safety hazard honestly.  I almost gave them two stars for being overpriced and and way under delivering, but the flavors were good.  

I get it, this is lobster and we are in a desert, so it is not going to be cheap.  However this was price gouging for what I recieved.  I went to another lobster truck in the valley last year that gave me almost twice as much in an order,  the prices were the same, and way more thought and care was put into it.  They were also slammed with people, and they managed to give me quality vs this place that was dead and gave me food that looked like someone just threw it together in a rush.  I am super bummed I was wanting to like this place more."}
{"text":"Don't get me wrong it is a good lobster roll but being from Massachusetts the lobster didn't have the same sweet flavor. 

I've tried the Maine roll and the Connecticut roll each twice now.  There is too much claw meat and not that sweeter tail meat that people want.

They do it right without too much sauce.

Stick to the rolls.  The lobster quesadilla was too much you lose the lobster completely with all the cheese"}
{"text":"I order the Maine lobster roll ($14.79) and the Cousins lobster tacos ($13.87) they both were delicious but the portions were too small for the price you pay.  Again, it was tasty but expensive, after tax and tip the total for two small items were $33.87"}
{"text":"Amazing FOOD I've never been so satisfied,  with such a unique  food truck , great service even when they are slammed !"}
{"text":"I was very looking forward this connecticut lobster roll as I enjoyed it so much last time I had it at the food truck in Irvine CA. However, this one just didn't taste as good as the one I had last time in Cali... :( Disappointed."}
{"text":"They came to my hospital at lunch break. So nice not to have to eat at our crapertia. 

Got a Connecticut  lobster roll.  It was ok good. Nothing special. If you are a fat American, you will be disappointed. The portion sizes are normal world sized.

Friend got shrimp tacos. 3 for $10. Shrimpys were tiny ok flavor. 

They are pricey!  But i guess thats coz it is quality lobsters :/"}
{"text":"Save ur money on the lobster bisque and shrimp tacos. The lobster bisque was flavorless and lacked lobster and the shrimp tacos were full of these tiny nasty little shrimp. I will never eat there again."}
{"text":"Still no won't go back to your place ever. 
Your good is horrible and service isn't any better."}
{"text":"After going to Lobster ME, I wanted a redo of lobster. I was craving lobster and Lobster ME left me disappointed. It worked out because we came here after having some oysters at Oyster Bar one evening. We weren't full and wanted to stay with the seafood theme. This food truck is clean and they surprisingly accept both cash and credit. There was nothing spectacular about customer service but they made the order quickly. 

I ordered the Maine under Rolls. It was only $17 but it came with several good sized pieces of lobster. It was smaller than average for a lobster roll but it was tasty. With the order they provided napkins but no wipes. On the side of the window, there was salt, pepper and spice that you could add to your order. There is no where to sit and dine. It was really cold with the drafts passing through so I ate as quickly as I could while savoring each bite. 3.5 stars but it satisfied my lobster craving."}
{"text":"Finally able to catch up to this food truck and I was SO excited to find it..I wish the girl working in the window was half as excited as I was   They don't even explain what they offer...just what do you want...not the friendliest group.The sandwich was good ....but I always thought a Maine lobster roll was with celery and tossed in mayo...not just lobster meat and mayo put on the bun...and the piece of lemon they give you was the size of a cherry or smaller....oh well...if I see them again..I see them again....but I won't be chasing this truck....."}
{"text":"Not worth it. The $17 lobster roll is soo small and does not have lot of flavor. Don't waste your money on this."}
{"text":"Came down to this spot because of photos we seen on instagram.NOT WORTH IT. Especially cause it cost as much as it does. No. Food was okay but seriously how you sell an 18 dollar piece of toast with imitation lobster meat. Key west raised."}
{"text":"So disappointed. They packaged my lobster roll with a lemon wedge, which saturated the roll with lemon juice -  making it soggy and completely throwing off the taste. Lobster pieces were so small, it could have been a langostino. Not worth the money. Can't wait to get back to Maine for a real lobster roll."}
{"text":"Expected amazing , not amazing. 
First I was the only one in line instead of greeting me he takes a phone call, not a quick one.

I tried the lobster tacos at 13.18 for the very small portions I was expecting high quality tasting food, it was only average taste and too high price point for serving size.  


The food wasn't horrible , but I wouldn't repeat."}
{"text":"For a food truck, the lobster was pretty amazing.  Was nice and cool and had the texture and flavor that I'd expect at a decent restaurant.  The tots were nice as well.  Crunchy, gluten-free, and not too greasy.

The only bummer is that they were out of corn tortillas at noon.  Not sure how that happens, but it did."}
{"text":"Growing up in Connecticut along  the shore line I've eaten my fare share of seafood.  Since moving away and now living on the west coast I was excited to find Cousins Maine Lobster.  This past weekend I found one located inside the Smiths shopping center at Durango and Warm springs.  I ordered the clam chowder and the cold lobster roll.  

VERY DISAPPOINTED.   The chowder was like warm with hardly any clams and the Lobster roll had NO FLAVOR at all.  Do yourself a favor and go to Red Lobster or better yet make your own.  

Too much HYPE on this place."}
{"text":"This was a cart on the strip offering lobster rolls. Yes! It was sub-par at best. I mean it was lobster on a buttered hot dog bun. Lobster was fresh, but over cooked, lacked flavor, and was rubbery. The bun wasn't toasted, but buttered so it was greasy. If it had been what I hoped for the price would've been cool, but $20? Don't waste your time or money."}
{"text":"Fantastic food! They deliver exactly what they advertise.                                        (that was 1st experience)                                                                                    
Since then- the have been a no show at one time/location posted on website and the next time I went. My food had a hair!  Sorry, no more Cousins for me."}
{"text":"I'm from Massachusetts and living here in Las Vegas now I miss fresh seafood sooo much! Most of the lobster here is not from Maine but thank goodness for the Cousins truck!!! They r always super nice and the Connecticut roll is AMAZING! They bring a little bit of New England 2 the desert!!!"}
{"text":"It was My first time offering from this food truck and I found pubic hair.  so unacceptable"}
{"text":"I went here because of Shark Tank, of course, and the fact that I love lobster!  I read many of the Yelp reviews beforehand and knew what to expect.  The Maine lobster roll was small, that's for sure, but it really did have a good amount of lobster in that small roll.  Now, being from Kansas, I am not anywhere near a lobster roll expert (honestly may have had 1 in my life before), so I can't speak to it's place in the lobster roll hierarchy.  But, I thought it was very tasty although expensive as hell for $17...I at least like to get more than a snack for that price.  I would probably try the Connecticut roll on my next trip to Fremont, just to say I did, but if I'm really hungry, I'll take a few more steps to Evel Pie and grab a couple slices for half that price."}
{"text":"So disappointing!! We just got back from the foodie fest in Vegas. I missed this truck last year, so I made a bee line this year and made this my first stop. I should have missed it again.
First of all, for $17.00 I expected the bun to be on a french roll. NOT! It's on a tiny, what looked to be a hot dog bun. Actually, regular hot dog buns are bigger. Secondly, we ordered it \"Connecticut  style\" meaning the lobster is hot. It was completely cold. Lobster was also overcooked. And the lobster amount was tiny and NO CLAW MEAT! I know lobster can be pricey, but I felt robbed. Never again."}
{"text":"I had avoided getting a lobster roll from them since I have had such good ones on the East Coast.
 I finally tried one at the Sunset Park'd festival this past weekend. I expected it to be pricey, most food trucks are plus it's lobster in the desert.  It was super tiny, not a lot of meat. It was way over cooked, liked chewing on rubber, didn't have much taste either. I was so disappointed. I have learned my lesson and will continue to steam a lobster at home when I'm in the mood.
I suggest skipping this food truck."}
{"text":"Hard to find lobster as is. I mean at a fast food or food truck in this case. Tried the cousins lobster tacos. AMAZINGLY cooked. Good tater tots and all food fresh. Was very impressed and I am a foodie girl. Perfect location as well. Downtown good job guys"}
{"text":"I was not to impressed with there lobster grilled sandwich , it was sooooooo boring at look like my 2year old made it , better try other truck the lobster taste like it was old or on the fridge for a long time not very impressed"}
{"text":"They stopped by work today, so OK I gave them a try.  The lobster roll was good, but small.  Not enough for a lunch.  Lobster Me if far better, bigger and meatier.  Also had a taste of the tots with lobster.  Was good, but mostly tator tots.  The food was good, but expensive.  The roll was $14 compared to Lobster Me's price of $17 for about 1 1/2 the size."}
{"text":"Awesome little Maine & Connecticut lobster roll from a food truck! I had the Maine roll which was perfectly cooked & tasty. The bread was spot on. Just a little less sauce next time. I will return for the Connecticut roll"}
{"text":"Not very good. Had the Connecticut, which is served warm. Mine was overly greasy and had no flavor. It also had a few shells in it, didn't bother finishing it. Not worth the $$$!!!"}
{"text":"We usually follow them here in Vegas and it's always been good, a little pricey though. My husband just brought home two Maine lobster rolls and the bread on both was hard and the lobster tasted really fishy like maybe it was not as fresh. Definitely not what we are use to getting. Maybe they need to do quality control better before they take the truck out."}
{"text":"I was disappointed.. I thought this was going to be so much better for the 21$ I spent. But it was not as flavour as I imagined. I will stick with Luke's lobster."}
{"text":"Try finding the current week's schedule on a Monday morning. Won't be there. It will be blank. Email them and you may get a reply days or weeks later -- if at all. Tired of chasing them -- there's much better and easier lobster to catch elsewhere in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"We got a lobster roll.  It was good but didn't resemble photos. Also, the guy who waited on me was super rude.  I probably won't be back next time we go to an event with the truck there.   The staff did not treat us with any level of respect and I was upset that he was so nasty. No food is worth being treated badly. :("}
{"text":"Disgusting .... this is no lobster roll.  It's a huge shit pile of mayonnaise underneath some yes good lobster but this sandwich roll is the MOST OVERPRICED AND DISGUSTING lobster roll I have ever had in my life.  NYC Maine hell I've had a better lobster roll in Florida.  

I mean nobody I know wants a four tablespoon helping of Mayo dropping into their mouth with every bite. God I'm repulsed.  I literally want to throw this sandwich to the uncaring person in the truck slopping his low quality no effort crap to us in Summerlin. 

Are you kidding me look people if you've ever had an amazing lobster roll you will be so angered at the crap they give you here. 

The quality of the lobster is great but plain lobster on a roll with a bed of mayo underneath one more time FLAVORLESS DISGUSTING WASTE OF $17 RUN AWAY FROM THIS CRAPPY OVER PRICED TRUCK ! 

If I pay fkn $17 for a lobster roll I want an overfilled sandwich. Not a shitty sandwich that has a tiny amount of lobster and shit ton of mayo. 

God this TRUCK should be banned from Las Vegas ! Period"}
{"text":"Finally had a chance to try the lobster roll.  Being from the east coast I have had my share.  Sorry but it was very underwhelming. You got the roll right and the amount of lobster was pretty good although slightly pricey.  The main problem I had was that the lobster meat was overcooked and chewy.  I didn't taste the mayo until almost my last bite.  Sorry Barbara I won't be back."}
{"text":"I stopped at this truck on a Tuesday afternoon for lunch and it hit the spot. 
I ordered the Lobster Tacos $16 which comes with 3 tacos. It was only a 3-4 minute wait while they prepared it.
The tacos had a good amount of lobster, sauce and cabbage on it within the floor tortilla. I give it a 4/5 since I believe the lobster could have had better/fresh flavor. Overall though, pretty good tacos."}
{"text":"I can't speak for much other than the lobster bisque. It was good, but nothing special. They had some small pieces of lobster in there. It's great on a cold day, but I'm not sure how good I would think it really is. The price is a bit high for a food truck, since they're using lobster as their ingredients."}
{"text":"Sad that the review couldn't be better because we were really looking forward to trying their food! We ordered a Connecticut and Maine lobster roll and paid almost $30. I get it, it's lobster. But my kid's hot dog lunch was bigger than the lobster rolls. The Maine roll was super disappointing. The lobster was chewy and stringy, so it being served cold with a glob of mayo was incredibly unappetizing; we threw it out after one bite each. The Connecticut roll was a little better because it's served warm but the lobster was still chewy and stringy. The bread was the best part of both sandwiches. It was a bummer, but at least we got to try it."}
{"text":"Lobster tots!!!!!   Awesome.  I still think abt those all the time.  So many flavors, made right on the spot fresh!!!"}
{"text":"I got to taste Cousins Main Lobster at a recent event. I remembered hearing about it from Shark Tank, so I got super excited.

They definitely served up a solid lobster roll. It was probably one of the purest I've ever had - no mayo, just butter on a perfectly-toasted bun. Served with a lemon!

Not sure it's better than some of the lobster places in the New York area, but I can see how it's a major treat in the NV area. I am excited I got to try it out!"}
{"text":"I've ordered from Cousins twice now. The first time was amazing! I had the Connecticut Lobster Roll with an order of plain tater tots which lived up to the expectation and much more! The second time around I wanted to explore the menu so I ordered their shrimp tacos. I know, why order shrimp tacos from a lobster truck right? Well I'm here to stop any future person from ordering them as it is definitely not worth it! You would think you get what you pay for right? The whole taste overall was like eating fish sticks. No flavor at all. I attached a picture and I had to zoom in as the shrimp were so miniscule. Probably smaller than the chopped tomatoes. Next time I'll stick to only lobster items off the menu."}
