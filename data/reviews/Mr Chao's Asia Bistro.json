{"text":"Was told by manager that this restaurant had honey walnut shrimp so we sat down and ordered hws. However,  not only did they not have honey walnut shrimp, their substitute was honey pecan shrimp that was really nothing like hws. I asked for the white sauce that normally comes on hws and what I got was a side of sweetened mayonnaise which was practically dumped on our table by the manager.  I asked the manager if she was angry and in a raised voice said, \"No, are you?\"  Anyway, it went down from there. Needless to say, we don't recommend the pecan shrimp (no broccoli either), and we don't recommend interfacing with the manager. However,  our waitress (who was new to the restaurant) was very good and tried to mitigate the manager's poor performance."}
{"text":"Good, fresh chinese food, a little pricey.

There are two types of chinese food. Cheap, greasy, satisfying chinese food in a questionable joint. And upscale atmospheric chinese food that aspires to captivate the same audiences that enjoy places like P.F Chengs. This would be the latter: an awhatukee hole in the wall version of P.F chengs. Very clean restaurant, nice atmosphere, and good service. You can tell their motif is such that they cater to the tukee types with a little more coin in hand :/. This is the kind of place you'll find a lot of older families, or much older groups of friends dining together in. 

Both the orange chicken, and the almond chicken were good, and were made barring on the side of caution when it comes to grease. They were big portions (for $8), with big fresh peices of white meat, fresh vegetables, and no MSG. There is no chance of this meal offending a pickier type with grease, textures, or flavors (which makes it less interesting in my opinion).

Both dishes were good, but nothing amazing from the 2 dishes I tried. 

The green tea ice cream was good, but I've had better green tea ice cream :/ . their version was a little too heavy with cream, and could have used some fruit, or something creative to go with the ice cream. 

The only other dessert option was another flavor of ice cream.

The service was great, very polite and friendly waiters."}
{"text":"Great food and great service. Wish they were open a little later especially on weekends. But always a great experience whether fine in or carry out. Hot and Sour Soup is one of the best."}
{"text":"We have dined and taken out from Mr. Chao's many times.  What a gem of a find in Ahwatukee; an area fairly devoid of high quality locally owned restaurants.  Chao's is the rare exception.  The service has always been excellent and the food is always great.   All the ingredients are clearly fresh and each plate made to order. Spices were alive and spot on.  We have had a good deal of the menu and have never been disappointed.  I will say the hot and sour soup is seriously one of the (if not the best) I have had anywhere.  One of my go to favorites is the fresh basil and abalone mushrooms with chicken and I highly recommend it.  

This is seriously one of the best restaurants in the area.  Really, stop in and try this hidden little gem, you won't be sorry!!!"}
{"text":"The wonton soup is to die for! Me and my girlfriend can't get enough of it! We also love the sesame chicken! It's so good! We are going to start trying more entrees in our next upcoming visits, and from the looks of other patrons tables they look delicious as well!

The inside seating is very nice and/or you can order for pick up!"}
{"text":"Oh Mr. Chao...you really let me down.

I decided to order from here on a very important day. I was sick.

When i'm sick I want spicy, hot, asian food. It's what i crave, it's what i need.

Knowing that Panda Express just wasn't going to cut it for this craving, i went to my fellow yelpers for advice. I knew i wanted realllllly good Chinese good, i didn't care how much it cost. When i'm sick, i want what i want, and nothing else matters. However, i needed a place that delivered or i could go and pick up ASAP and Mr. Chao's was it!

I ordered:
*Extra Spicy BBQ Pork Fried Rice
*Beef & Broccoli (boyfriend)
*Steamed Rice (b/f)
* General Tso's Chicken-extra spicy

The rice was overcooked. done, done, and done again. The rice kernels were almost stale tasting, just looking at the pork made me sick, and I'm pretty sure i said extra spicy...and there was none. Very bland

Beef & Broccoli was surprisingly good--but it wasn't mine, so boo hoo, moving on

Steamed rice--average...but how could you screw this up?

General's Chk--Much like the rice actually. WAY overcooked. The chicken was extremely dry, and the breading had been BURNED. Also, where the heck was the extra spice i asked for? And lastly, did i order chicken strips? boneless wings? because i got chicken tenders, not chunks. 

**I would also like to mention, there was NO language barrier that would cause the mess-up of my order. Unless you consider high school kids to have a different language than us adults--which is entirely possible**

$40 and few dollar tip later, most of it ended in the trashcan, and i ate toast instead.

I won't be back"}
{"text":"Outstanding food at Mr. Chao's. Best Chinese restaurant in Ahwatukee. Wonderful place for a night out with friends, or for dinner out with the kiddos.  Highly recommend the spicy peanut wontons, Mr. Chao's house chicken, sesame chicken... Well, pretty much everything I've had here has been incredible. A real gem!"}
{"text":"Pros: chicken was all white meat chicken, staff was very friendly, convenient location
Cons: food was just okay, prices were very expensive

I just moved to Phoenix recently and based on yelp and local recommendations decided to try Mr. Chao's.  We got our usual Chinese food order of orange chicken, sweet & sour chicken, small plain lo mein and two egg rolls.  At other Chinese places, this is usually less than $20.  At Mr. Chao's it was $34!  On top of that the food was just okay, I've had better orange chicken and sweet & sour chicken at other places.  Even though the service was good, because of the price and quality of the food, I won't be going back."}
{"text":"We ordered out some veg. food.  Sorry, not good at all.  Quite bland, watery, dishes. Egg rolls were more spring rolls with thin deep fried paper wrap.   Our go to place is Yao's in Chandler, but we need one closer to home.  Will keep looking."}
{"text":"Yummy Chinese food.  I love the eggplant dish.  Good for dining in or take-out."}
{"text":"We tried Mr Chao's Asian Bistro last night. It's a small place and they do a lot of take-out orders. The quirky interior works fine for me. My wife thought the single gourami looked kind of sad in the small, flat tank on the wall. They have a bar and a decent selection of wine for a small restaurant. I tried one of the specials, the Hunan Smoked Pork. It was basically kind of like bacon stir-fried with fresh vegetables with a spicy Hunan black bean sauce. I love bacon and I really liked this dish. My wife had prawns w/vegetables, we liked the freshness of the vegetables and generous amount of prawns but overall the dish was slightly bland. She liked it but thought that it would have been better with the lobster sauce. We were mixed on the iced tea, my wife felt it was too strong but I thought it was fine. 

Overall, Mr Chao's is a fine choice in Ahwatukee for Americanized Chinese food. It is a bit pricier than our usual stop, Panda Garden, but a nice alternative."}
{"text":"I have been frequenting this restaurant since 2004. This is the finest Chinese food establishment you'll find in the greater Phoenix area. I would highly recommend Chaos Chicken (spicy), sesame chicken or the sweet and sour chicken, which is my wife's favorite. If you're in the mood for quality Chinese you've found it."}
{"text":"Authentic Asian food.   Not the greasy, glazed over Chinese food that most Asian restaurants here in PHX serve.   These dishes are homemade and authentic and are really, really good.  

Beef and broccoli is just how my mom makes it.  The green curry noodles are a delicate dish to make and can often times be watery if you don't know what you're doing.  This was done very, very well.  

One of the best places for Asian in PHX."}
{"text":"3rd time we've tried - 3x bad. We paid $114.77 family of 6. Pork pot-stickers undercooked. One bite & threw out. All chicken - low quality dark meat w/ grizzle. Ate few pieces of chicken, couldn't stomach. 4 hours later woke w/ extreme nausea & began vomiting - persisted 18 hours. Don't eat here."}
{"text":"I live in chicago and today, after a night of liver destruction...I was forced to order chinese food.  I have lived here for a year and have not found THE CHINESE place.  Mr. Chao's Asian Bistro has ruined me for life. 

By far the best chinese food I have ever had in all of my 34 years. I love it so much that I had it as my last meal before I relocated to Chicago.  

The veggies are crisp and fresh and the flavors POW, BANG,ZOOM in your mouth.  

I should also mention that it is a chinese food restaurant that you actually want to eat in and not just pick up or get delivery.  Great atmosphere, i use to take friends there all the time.  I have a friend here in Chicago that visited me while I lived there and she actually just said to me the other day \" i wish i had some mr chaos\" .

I miss you Mr Chaos."}
{"text":"Great food, clean and nicely decorated, quiet with nice music playing in the background. We had the Pad Tai with chicken, Orange Chicken, kid's noodles with \"no-no\" and the edamame appetizer. Everything was tasty and was served hot and fast. Our grandson gave it two thumbs up - and that is saying something. They have a quality bar selection for the adults as well. This is the nicest Asian restaurant in Ahwatukee."}
{"text":"Very disappointing. Not traditional Chinese food. Not worth the money."}
{"text":"I ordered sweet and sour chicken along with sasame chicken to go. . The food was alright but nothing to brag about.
The crab puffs were pretty good. Spent over $33 for those three items. I expected more for the price."}
{"text":"I love this place. Food is excellent and service exceptional. My husband and I have been coming here for years and never been disappointed. Lunch and dinner is great. Doing take out tonight and can't wait to get home!!!"}
{"text":"Amy & Andy, along with their son, run an amazing Asian fusion restaurant. The Spicy Boiled Wontons in the  peanut sauce will chaaaaaange your life. You'll dream about it! They use great quality meat & veggies and Andy makes everything fresh. Lve them!"}
{"text":"This is one of our go-to restaurants when we want a special night out. The food is delicious and always good. We order the sizzling rice soup as an appetizer and have always been happy with the entrees. The boyfriend's favorite dish is the honey walnut shrimp and my favorite dish is their spicy basil chicken and abalone (mushroom).

The ambience of the place is very nice and we've always had great service. My only complaint is that the last two times we drove to Ahwatukee specifically to eat at this place, they were closed for special events. We've been a bit gun shy about driving back the last few months. :("}
{"text":"Call ahead and order their WONDERFUL lobster special. A subtle plum wine/tomato sauce scents the fresh New England lobster, cooked on a bed of noodles. If you love lobster, this is for you!"}
{"text":"Enjoyable, clean and friendly Chinese restaurant.
Our waitress, Hailey, was helpful with great customer service. The food - Kung pao chicken, pepper beef and sesame chicken were all fresh and tasty."}
{"text":"I visited this place once or twice based on reviews by some of the folks at work and the fact that it was close by.  I can appreciate the fact that the heavy window shades help keep the A/C bill down, but it's pretty dark in there!  

I normally choose some of my staples when sizing up a new Chinese / Asian restaurant.  That would be won ton soup and chow mein.  Wow.  Very salty!  I'm not sure what was up with the broth in the soup but it was the darkest brew I've ever seen.  Not too fond of the fact that a lot of the chicken dishes feature dark meat either.  On the other hand, it wasn't super greasy but that's not enough to win me over.  Co-worker Dave wasn't impressed either so we didn't go back after the 2nd try."}
{"text":"We came here with family last night and haven't had good Chinese food in a while and was in heaven. We found our new Chinese food restaurant.."}
{"text":"We had the pot stickers, cashew chicken, mongolian beef, and the sweet & sour chicken.  The food was awesome!!!  Freshly made, hot and delicious.  Would definitely recommend it to a friend."}
{"text":"First off, something that really upsets me is when the server tells my party that the service is slow tonight because they are short handed.  I want to be told that when I walk in the door so I can choose to leave before I order, not after I have ordered and the food is taking too long to come out.  Unacceptable.  My Gen. Tso's chicken was made from all white meat chicken fingers, not the usual chicken pieces.  The flavor was okay, but it did not taste like any Gen. Tso's I have ever had.  The crab puffs were the worst I have ever had - not crispy and bland.  The pricing is quite high, usually about $2-3  more than comparable restaurants per item.  They only serve dinner to my knowledge, so maybe that's why they charge so much.  The beer is cold, but not as cold as it should be.  The cocktails have almost no flavor of alcohol in them.  The rice is fine.  Once we convinced the waitress that we actually needed menus from which to order, the service, although slow, was okay.  You'll get a better meal from Pei We for a lot less money,  just no booze.  I shan't be returning.  I seem to know what Mr. Chao's does not, that there is competition out there."}
{"text":"Mr Chao's is a cute chinese restaurant. It's cozy with a lot of booth seating available. The quantities are smaller than the average chinese places but the food tastes pretty good."}
{"text":"I need Mr Chaos to leave Ahwatukee and come move in next to me - seriously, there's available property and everything.

We got takeout from here and it was sooo tasty.  Generous portions, so we were all able to sample a little of everything.  Their crab puffs were excellent, and perfectly crispy on the outside.  I can't wait for an excuse to go get another dinner from here!"}
{"text":"Excellent food and portions...try the Spicy Wonton appetizer!  I have enjoyed every dish I have had here."}
{"text":"Just a quick update.... Took my parents here for lunch today, and now I have 2 more converts! If anyone is still sleeping on this place, shame on you; you're really missing out. Why? DELICIOUS food made from QUALITY ingredients and FRESHLY prepared hot to order. Good stuff all around!"}
{"text":"We've had both dine in and take out from Mr. Chao's. 99% of the food is wonderful and the staff is so friendly. The only thing on the menu I wouldn't order again is the orange chicken. It was suuuuuper bitter and not my thing. I'd say other than that, this is the best Asian restaurant in the area"}
{"text":"Mr. Chao's used to be a favorite of ours, but we hadn't been there in a several months. We noticed a new menu with new items and slightly higher prices, so we were wondering if there was an ownership change or just a need to rein in costs.

Ordered the hot and sour soup which was very good, if a touch too vinegary (my wife thought it was perfect). We also ordered the Kung Pao Chicken and Mongolian Beef and that's where the problems came in. 

The sauces and flavors were outstanding as usual, but the quality of the meat was very poor. The chicken was all fatty dark meat and the beef was also fatty and too chewy. I had to spit out several pieces.

Also, the proportions of meat to vegetables was much too small, as if the restaurant wanted to fill our plates with cheaper veggies. (The Mongolian Beef should have been called Mongolian Onion.)

I know it's a tough economy and appreciate the need to cut costs. But customers are also cutting expenses, so we'll avoid Chao's until they improve the quality."}
{"text":"Good standard Chinese food with a little Thai thrown in.  A little expensive if you are thinking of Chinese take out prices, but the food was good and so was the service.  I will be back."}
{"text":"A little pricey, but the food is wonderful and the ambiance is great for a date. The lights are low and the music soft, the libations plentiful. 

I wouldn't go here for take-out because of the price, but I eat-in here at least once a month."}
{"text":"If you go to their website and check their business hours you will learn they are NOT open for lunch (I wasted a trip because of this :(
i makes me not want to try again when they can't keep a simple website accurate!"}
{"text":"Wow. What is wrong with me. Been in Ahwatukee 4 years and I have never tried Mr. Chao's. This place is off he charts. Fresh ingredients, great flavor and THE best hot and sour soup I have ever had. This is my number 1 Asian bistro. They also have grew at service. The full package. Great job guys!"}
{"text":"Love this place.  Great food and service.  Best hot and sour soup you will ever have.  Mr. Chao's chicken is awesome, too!"}
{"text":"This has been my family's Chinese restaurant of choice for years! Great food. Great service. Never been disappointed!
Price maybe slightly on the not-so-cheap side, but I think Chinese food in general isn't as cheap as it used to be. Still wonderful. Definitely check this place out."}
{"text":"This place is amazing, it was our first time here. We shared the crab puffs and the MrChows house chicken, it is a must. We will definitely be back. Our waitress was very sweet , the restaurant is spotless with a nice relaxing vibe. This is a gem just outside of Ahwatukee!! We even took a pint of thrifty black cherry ice cream home from here. Score!!"}
{"text":"We were craving Sizzling Rice Soup and Spicy Chicken, but got a voice message when we called. Checked out the web and even drove down thinking they were so busy to even answer the phone. Alas, they are closed today. Bummer. If Monday is going to be like this every week, maybe they'll update the website and sign on the door?"}
{"text":"Great food & good service. Love the appetizers, the Mr Chao house chicken entree & the SZECHWAN GREEN BEANS with chicken. Plus it's very close to our house so it's not a long (Scottsdale) drive & we can order take out."}
{"text":"Hit or miss, hence the 3 stars.  I've had meals there that make me feel that they warrant the \"Best Chinese Food in Ahwatukee\" title, and others that make me a little down that they couldn't be better.  This is one of those places where the waitstaff can switch from attentive to awkward, really positively or negatively affecting the meal.  I wish I could just objectively review the food for any restaurant, but if you forget my drink and to take my order while working the rest of the room (and I'm talking to you, Mr. Chao), then anything I eat afterwards is just not going to seem as good.

On a good night...I've had some of the yummiest potstickers I've ever had in Arizona (and beyond) - delicately flavored with the perfect amount of ginger and seared on the bottoms, I could have eaten 20 by myself.  Sesame Chicken is all white meat, crispy and perfectly sauced without being cloyingly sweet.  Mongolian Beef is tender and savory, over a crisp bed of noodles that add a great texture counterpoint.  Combination fried rice passed Mitch G's (and my) yellow rice test - large shrimp, tender beef and chicken, and the perfect amount of egg and diced veggies - I would eat a plate of just this easily and be a happy duck.

On a bad night...hot and sour soup touted as \"One of the best in the area\" was WAY too sour, oddly flavored, and full of huge chunks of semi-raw celery.  My husband took one bite and pushed it away, which left me struggling eating nasty soup for 4 people.  Beef with String Beans was overcooked, oversauced and tasted of Chinese 5-Spice powder more than anything else.  Huge disappointment.  Pomegranate martini was overly sweet, not at all strong, and a waste of a martini glass.

The decor is elegant, but a bit of a laugh.  They're trying to be modern, and while I love the specials written on the tile wall in the back of the place, the framed photos of salad greens is comical at best.  Just what I want to gaze at in a Chinese restaurant - chopped romaine.

I'm going to give Mr. Chao's another try because they are indeed ahead of the pack of other Chinese restaurants in the area, but there are some serious kinks in terms of reliability and consistency that need to be worked out."}
{"text":"We love Mr. Chow's.  The food is very fresh with lots of veggies, tastes great and they have vegan options.  If they don't have exactly what you want on the menu, they will make up what you do want."}
{"text":"Best hot and sour soup I have ever had! After 3 years of looking for a good Chinese restaurant we found it hidden in plain sight. Mr Chao Chicken was very good, Mongolian beef great. This our new go to stop!"}
{"text":"We were looking for some Chinese and finally found it!!! 
This is best Chinese Restaurant in town by far, if you like this type of food you don't hesitate and try it!
I try several around the neighborhood and nothing compares!

So... Welcome Chinese food again"}
{"text":"It looked like a cool place when I arrived for the quick go getter for lunch.
But I need more when it comes to the general tso (chow) chicken.
It was a lunch special and came with soup. The portion size was not
enough for me and the general tso chicken was not to my expectations.
I left 4 stars because the experience was good had they had the right stuff for me.
I will keep searching for the general chow chicken that taste like the house of yang's."}
{"text":"I think that this is the best Chinese in the area and I came one time before and they messed up on my to go order but they squared it up next time, they are a good fresh place to go with honest family. Thanks"}
{"text":"Everyone I have ever taken here, loves it.  They have very tasty food that is always fresh.  I don't know how they do it, but everything has such intense flavors.  Service is always good and prices are fair for the taste, freshness and service.  Small and quaint they do have one table for a larger group."}
{"text":"I have eaten here two times now the first time it was pretty dead in the place and there was what looked like a group of kid's part of the family... My server seemed to cater to that group over me I am a paying customer keep that in mind... I ordered the General Tso's Chicken (Crunchy fried white meat tossed with scallions in a spicy sauce. I was a good meal nothing above and beyond... The second trip was for a lunch and I ordered the Mongolian beef (Spicy marinated beef sautéed with scallions and sweet yellow onions served over a bed of crispy rice noodles and sprinkled with sesame seeds... This was a really good meal and great service so let's hope the third this as good."}
{"text":"No, not impressed. Quite expensive too. Good thing it was not greasy, bad thing it was not interesting. Probably aint gonna come back."}
{"text":"This is the most cozy yummy Asian fusion restaurant in Ahwatukee!! The food is made fresh to order and the staff is amazing and well versed on the menu. They offer gluten free dishes which makes it an option for those with food allergies and/or sensitivities. The spicy wonton soup is this best appetizer on the menu (I think). Definitely worth a try!!"}
{"text":"I searched hi and lo and had only been able to make good on the very lo with regards to good Chinese food in the Valley.  I am VERY picky and I rate most Chinese food places based on the thickness of the membrane of their won-ton soup and the colour of their fried rice.  Having passed my non doughy and not yellow test ( yup people, some places give you frozen dumplings versus fresh and yellow \"Spanish Rice\" in a Chinese restaurant), I was able to look into the quality of their other food items.
When you can deliver Mei Fun Singapore style noodles perfectly seasoned with no greasy residue, I feel you deserve that illusive fifth star.  
Service was pleasant and there was a lot of foot traffic for take away items.  I also note that they offered iced Thai tea with cream.  My buddy got a plate of broccoli, tofu, and a wonderful  Kun Pao sauce.  Sorry, but I think he created it himself and they make everything to order just for food snobs such as we.

Hmmmm.  I am getting hungry. I think  I will go  there now.  Wonder if I should get their pepper steak."}
{"text":"You must get the BBQ pork fried rice! It's amazing. So are the egg rolls.  They always make your order fast.  It's a staple in Ahwatukee."}
{"text":"I have eaten here twice and it is really  clean and efficient.
 Adrienne my waiter is always polite and attentive.

My first visit was lunch and they offer lunch time specials so I liked that!'
I ordered Buddha's Delight, it came with a variety of perfectly woked veggies, not at all greasy and perfectly fried tofu. The sauce was very light and gave it a clean  fresh taste. The side of brown rice was cooked perfectly as well :)
Also they have a great prices on beers, wine and cocktails  from lunch through Happy Hour.
Second visit. Yes I ordered the same thing, consistent as the first time , I was pleased. My lunch companion ordered the Vegetable Chow Mien. It was delicious and veggies woked perfectly. I like a crunch, no soggy here. The sauce was light and definitely not over salted as most Chinese food seems to be.
  ~You know those places when after you get home your downing massive amounts of water due to overloading of sodium in the  food?!
After writing this review I have got the craving to have Mr Chaos right now!"}
{"text":"We love this place! The crab wontons are one of my favorites - such great crab flavor, not just cream cheese. The orange chicken is very good and the chicken has a nice crunch to it. We've only ever ordered take out but the interior is nice and the staff is always friendly."}
{"text":"When you first walk in you may think this is just another strip mall soggy egg roll, is that meat? Chinese restaurant. You would be wrong! This place has amazing service (thank you Stacy) and when I say amazing I mean service that would rival Capital Grill if it were a small establishment, that part may all just be Stacy :-) but the food is definitely Mr Cho and it's refreshing to have a chef with the last name Cho and not Rodriguez. No offense of course but traditional has its own special feel and taste and smell and it's wonderful to get it from someone truly rooted in the fairs homeland. (I'm part Mexican so don't call me racist I had tacos for breakfast!) I don't want me Cho cooking my enchiladas either. 

Ruling: Good food, good service and damn I'm good lookin!"}
{"text":"In the Oakland Bay Area Mr. Chao's is synonymous with a Chinese fast food where everything tastes the same.

In Phoenix AZ, it's synonymous with fantastically delicious quality food.

This is a \"bistro\" located in a strip mall (nothing new for Arizona) that has wonderful mood lighting that is warm and inviting.

The service is friendly and knowledgeable.

The food is awesome.  General Tso's Chicken, Mongolian Beef, Szechwan String Beans with Chicken and combination fried rice are so very good.  No questionable meat here.  Wonderful spices.  The Chinese Chicken salad has a bite to it that will keep you going back for more and more.

This place is a wonderful go-to for authentic Chinese food that will satisfy all the time."}
{"text":"LOVE this place! I've finally found a Chinese restaurant that I will come to every time I want Chinese food. Food was excellent, service was attentive and polite, very clean and well decorated, good music and ambiance. I will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"Don't waste your time or money.  The service is poor and the food is below average, nothing to write home about.  The restaurant is also very small."}
{"text":"We went to Mr Chao's Friday night to get away from the Wild Horse Pass Resort for a while.  The food is fantastic!  We loved it so much that we went back on Saturday after a full day of golf.  We were told the owner cooks all of the food, try the dumplings.  This is a hidden jewel...."}
{"text":"Delicious food. Tried for the first time today for lunch. Can't wait to come back! Service was great too."}
{"text":"So delicious!  I ordered the chicken pad thai and my fiancé ordered the orange chicken. I didn't think we were going to finish it but it was so delicious we finished it!  I was a little embarrassed but I loved it!  We will be back!"}
{"text":"We are always looking for good Chinese food and I can't believe never tried Mr. Chao's in our own backyard.  We read about it in the Ahwatukee Foothills News \"best of Ahwatukee\".    

We loved the Crab Puffs, Sesame Chicken and Broccoli and Beef.  We liked it so much we went on Friday and Saturday.  Service on Friday was great, Saturday it was packed and the service was a little off (thus 4 not 5 stars).

We'll be back, we can't wait to try new items."}
{"text":"This food was amazing. The freshest Chinese food I've tasted. Wonderful. I don't live close but I'll find a reason to drive by again and again! Enjoy!"}
{"text":"May be Good for Dine in, but don't bother on take out!! 2 entree's with NO extras was $24 and the main dishes were DRY and not spicy (one was supposed to be a SPICY dish). So I will go down the street a bit and get a Better, Cheaper Meal next time for take out!!!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"This place is pretty good from the dishes I tried, but I was clearly not as impressed as other people.  I suppose I was expecting more for the price point of this place, but it is certainly good food.  I had their orange beef, and also had a couple bites of their Lo Mein.

The orange beef sauce was delicious, and a slightly different take on it than I have ever had before, but the meat itself is the typcal frozen, thawed, and deep fried meat that I have come to expect from mediocre takeout places (Or at least it tasted like it if it wasn't).  The rice served with it was perfectly cooked, and the portion was extremely filling.

From the bites I had of the Lo Mein however, it tasted exactly like the Lo Mein from Magic Wok.  That is not to say it was bad, Magic Wok is still probably the best chinese you can get for the $5 - $10 price range, and they deliver!  I was expecting it to have a distinctive taste, or at least fresher ingredients for the around $20 price point.

Overall not a bad meal, well cooked, and good service if you dine-in.  The quality/freshness of their ingredients do not match their price point if you ask me though."}
{"text":"Ist time here...only people there at 530 on a saturday..walked in to the busser cussing without care...\"amy\"  1 of the worst waitress I've had in a long time...what a horrible attitude...will NEVER come back...sad though because the food was great...just. not the experience"}
{"text":"Food was good, but for the price i expected a little more. I ordered for takeout.  It tasted much the same as any other Chinese restaurant too me.  They didn't have any kid sized meals, so I had to pay the full-sized $12.95 just to get my daughter her teriyaki chicken, which is sort of dumb.

I probably won't go back just because I think I can get the food I want elsewhere for less. 

I will say it was clean and nicely decorated, so if you want to dine in then it would be worth it."}
{"text":"The food here is seriously so amazing, the spicy wontons are en pointe, I could eat that sauce with anything. We also ordered the Chinese chicken salad and the dressing was delicious. The Mr. Chaos chicken was crispy and tender. And the mifun noodles were my favorite. I could eat here every day!"}
{"text":"My fav Chinese place in Ahwatukee!! Great fresh food! Order to go or eat there! Nice and quiet! The house chicken is sooo good! Similar to general tso but we like it better !! Definitely recommend going there, you can tell the Cheif cooks it fresh and it's not just sitting there waiting to be double fried again!"}
{"text":"Had only 5 pieces of shrimp in shrimp fried rice. They were very rude and very mean. The Buddha Delight had very little  tofu in. The portion was too small for the money.
