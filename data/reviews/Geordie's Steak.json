{"text":"My husband and I went on our date night to try Geordie's. I'm not sure if it's because of the timing, but we were there at 8:30, service and food was okay history of the environment/mansion was pretty neat, we sat outside in the patio area, and every 5 minutes people were pulling trash, bringing trays of plates, glasses and etc. to go in the kitchen."}
{"text":"Disappointing. I have enjoyed brunch at the Wrigley Mansion Cub many times and it (previously) was one of the best brunches in the Valley. Times have changed; the brunch was simply not good, service disappointing and the facilities have deteriorated... not a good experience, whatsoever. Sadly..."}
{"text":"Had brunch on Valentines Day this year at 11am. They did not put any sterno fire under any of the dishes. Everything was cold. The gravy was congealed, lumpy & cold. Yuck. Went here in 2000 and all was lovely. My mom's 88th birthday was not as nice as I hoped it would be."}
{"text":"Came to Wrigley for the first time for brunch. Friendly and inviting staff! The food selections were expansive, so much so that I didn't have room to try everything that I wanted to! I also love that there is an ode to the current Hormel owners with a Spam offering on the buffet. Spectacular views and great service. Will return."}
{"text":"One of my Christmas gifts from my Husband,...Holiday Brunch @ Wrigley Mansion always  Wonderful ...and  Lovely!! ..the highlight was hanging out with \"the man\" George Benson and wife all the while sitting right next to us..and what a great human being and his wife soo lovely ..He loved Duke\"s suit ..!!

Truly a high point in r life time .. since Ron plays the saxophone and has played along with his guitar  forever..Quite huge...Thank You WM..xxoo"}
{"text":"Nothing special. The lunch menu limited and expensive.  Would have liked to have a little more history on the place."}
{"text":"Always a great spot for a Sunday Brunch or for just an appetizer and drink. Be sure to take the time to go through the Mansion and take in the history and scenic views. Sunday Brunch is still priced well with lots of selections."}
{"text":"Came in with a large group of girls this last Sunday for a birthday lunch and the buffet was on point. the staff was really friendly and even got in on one of our photos. we had a few servers but \"Prince\" definitely stood out, he made sure we never felt parched."}
{"text":"Beautiful views of the city and sunset.  Great place for a romantic dinner or dinner with a bunch of friends.  Reserve one of their private rooms for your large group.  

You must be a member to dine here.  The membership fee is reasonable.

We ordered ceviche, brisket, chicken piccata, salmon, salad, Brussels sprouts, scalloped potatoes and soup.  The brisket was moist and tender and full of flavor.  Must try.  Everything else was average. 

I gave them five stars for the service, experience and atmosphere."}
{"text":"Buffet selection is limited but our waiter kept the mimosas pouring in... So for a Sunday brunch, perfecto!"}
{"text":"This is our third time visiting this exquisite restaurant.  Three years in a row to celebrate our anniversary.   It is really a hidden gem because it is a \"club\" and they are limited in their advertising.   We have never had to wait for a table!!!   The food selections are limited intentionally I'm sure to ensure the high quality of the food selections.    The portions are very reasonable and well presented.  The location is a fantastic treasure of Phoenix and Chicago history because this is the Wrigley mansion of Wrigley Gum fame.   Well worth the trip."}
{"text":"The Wrigley Mansion is a historical and iconic Phoenix landmark that represents an epoch of development; buoyed by wonderful business people.

I love the story of Wrigley who began his chewing gum empire by sending free samples to people ('anyone whose name was published in the phone book - had enough money to purchase chewing gum': according to Wrigley).

The next time period is represented when Geordie Hormel purchased the Wrigley mansion and has left his mark with great customer service and delicious coffee and food.

The coffee is ground on site and purchased from a local coffee purveyor called Infusion Coffee.

Both Wrigley and Geordie blazed their own trails ignoring zeitgeist entirely.

The legends await us to enjoy.  Wrigley Mansion is listed on Hayden's top five places to see the sunset in Phoenix."}
{"text":"James Beard Award winning chef Christopher Gross relocated his kitchen to Geordie's at the historic Wrigley Mansion. Some of his menu followed him, but the most interesting was the Hormel Spam Cubano since the mansion is now owned by the Hormel family.  The chips were served in Spam can which my son thought was funny.  
His Escargot in puff pastry was excellent as usual as well as the Duck Breast with lemon braised leeks and red beet gratin.  Veal Chop with apricot risotto was absolutely delicious and cooked to perfection. Chicken pesto pasta was great as well.  All in all the food was excellent and the bread at this chef's restaurant are one of the best in Phoenix.  Service was friendly but kind of odd.  Perhaps the new staff at this place isn't trained properly..."}
{"text":"Came here for brunch for a birthday. It was well worth the money. The view of the city was outstanding and the brunch buffet and bottomless mimosas make it well worth the price. Service was attentive and refilled mimosas after a sip.  Brunch buffet options were incredible features salads, cold bar, as well as a carving station and pancake and omelet station. A lot of history surrounds this iconic landmark in Arizona and seeing it is incredible. A must for any special occasion or a weekend with friends."}
{"text":"I've always loved this place, but it's  just off my radar of places to frequent.  I heard they had a great happy hour with a  view - so I went Geordie's.  It was great- the place and the view are gorgeous - and with  1/2 price off glasses of wine - I was sold!  I wound up talking to the bartender Michael, who was extremely knowledgeable about wine - which I totally appreciate as a wine lover.  He was also super friendly and fun to talk to.   He told me they are actually opening up a new Wine Bar in the Wrigley Mansion, which he will be managing.  It's still under construction - but I can't wait to try it. The new place sounds exciting and right up my alley.  Now I'll have an even bigger reason to come back to the Mansion more often.  For now - the Happy Hour is definitely worth trying or a great reason revisit and enjoy some old world Phoenix charm in a beautiful setting!"}
{"text":"Before I arrived at the Wrigley Mansion Club, I made sure to consult Yelp, as one does, to make the most of my experience. Since I heard that their dining selections were OK at best, I decided to bring two of my friends to Geordie's Lounge during Happy Hour for some appetizers and cocktails. Unfortunately for us, the lounge had been rented out the day we arrived, and we were seated in the dining area, so we didn't get any of the discounts. 

We each ordered the Cocktail of the Day, which was a Prickly Pair Margherita served Martini style ($13). Then we ordered the Pancetta Mac and Cheese ($10), Roasted Vegetables with marinara and mozzarella cheese ($10), and flourless chocolate cake($9) to share. We originally ordered the Trio of Gelato, but were informed that they only had the pistachio, so we decided on the chocolate cake instead. We were informed that the sides we ordered were enough to feed 2.5 people and when the food arrived, we decided it was definitely an appropriate amount of food for us. We were also given complimentary garlic bread (which was delicious).

To rate the food, I would say I definitely enjoyed the Pancetta Mac and Cheese the most. It was very delicious and creamy, with bread crumbs and pancetta (Italian bacon). I would definitely order it again. The roasted vegetables were good as well, but overpriced, seeing as I could easily make something similar at home. Finally, the flourless chocolate cake was good as well, nothing I'd have to order again. I had never tried flourless cake before, but I don't know if it's supposed to be a little drier than a regular floured cake. Nonetheless, I enjoyed it.

In order to dine at the club, there is a $5 membership charge per table. My party and I took that as an invitation to give ourselves a self-guided tour of the property. It is a large, beautiful property overlooking Phoenix and since it was nearing sunset when we arrived, there were plenty of beautiful photography opportunities. 

I agree with the other reviewers. The view alone is worth the trip here. I would definitely come back and order a few cocktails or appetizers, have a good conversation, and watch the sun set again. 

Another tip: my friends and I were able to easily walk up from the self-parking lot to the entrance and it took only 2 or 3 minutes. However, if you're dressed up nicely for an event, wearing high heels, or you are walking in 115 degree weather, I would suggest valeting your car and walking straight up to the entrance.

Overall, I am glad to have been able to visit a Phoenix point of pride while I'm still living here in Arizona."}
{"text":"This restaurant has all the 5 star ingredients--and not just the food--the service was outstanding, thanks to Angela who took care of our every need--the setting, views and table spectacular. We had a delicious meal that we shared, including the duck and filet. The vegetables, especially the red beets au gratin, spectacular. If the food experience was not excellent in past years, the addition of a James Beard winning Chef has made all the difference! It was our wedding anniversary and the restaurant did everything in their power to make the evening special. We will return again as we fell in love with the place! Thank you."}
{"text":"The breakfast items were excellent. The fresh fruits, cheeses, omelettes, all were exceptional. The meet room on the other hand was a bit disappointing. I couldn't finish the chicken because it was way too dry. The crab claws smelled horrible and they were pretty cheap. But the ambiance was nice and the rest of the food was great."}
{"text":"I was extremely disappointed with my experience here. The mansion is beautiful and the view is incredible and the service and food only needed to be halfway decent for me to have enjoyed the experience. Unfortunately we had terrible service and the food was mediocre at best. To start we were there for 3 1/2 hours. Not because we were enjoying the experience and savoring our food, it was just that slow. We sat at our table for a full hour before our waitress even took our drink order. We ended up asking the busboy to help us at multiple points. She never once asked how everything was and constantly forgot to bring things that we asked for. The food was just as disappointing. Nothing was served at the correct temperature. When we mentioned it to the waitress she said she would let the kitchen know, but did nothing to correct it. The truly galling thing is that because we were a party of 6, we were forced to tip 20% for some of worst service we had ever encountered. I think that might have contributed to our crappy service, because the waitress seemed to give more attention to the smaller tables (perhaps because she knew she'd have to actually earn her tip).

At one point the manager came out to apologize for the slow service and gave us a bottle of champagne. That was nice, but did nothing to improve the experience moving forward. Nothing started coming out promptly, no one checked on us after that, and the food continued to come out room temperature. For the amount that we spent on dinner there, we could have gone to McDonalds every day for a month and had better service and better food."}
{"text":"My friend and I always try new places for brunch and we decided to rub shoulders with the ultra wealthy.

When you arrive, I recommend valet parking as the self lot fills up and is quite an incline to the entrance. Plus, you don't want to he seen as a commoner from the start do you?

Upon entering, we were greeted pleasantly and was asked for our reservation. Don't bother going without one. We were brought to our table with a stunning view overlooking the valley. The whole place screams of old money and rich feel, Titanic first class style. You sit down and are offered bottomless mimosas...those were free flowing.

The wait staff was really personable, which was to my surprise. From the first impression of the place, was expecting snooty service; however, we were pleasantly surprised. The food is buffet, but not your average buffet food. Quality, fresh food with a staff to chat it up with while you wait (omelet).

The food is great, the patrons are ridiculous. My friend, who could appreciate such things, was regularly pointing out $25,000 hand bags and other expensive women's clothing. If your net worth is less than $1 billion, you'll probably laugh at a lot of the folks there. Most are too proper and with very little conversation. They're more concerned with their posture and pleasantries.

$50 for brunch seems a really good deal, but they also add some for a trial membership to the mansion, required.

Overall, it's a great place with old money charm. Once the mimosas start flowing, it's all good anyways!!"}
{"text":"First time here and I'm an Arizona native. We came for restaurant week.  What a deal. They also had wine pairings for an additional $15. Loved it. It was a perfect complement to the meal. I ordered the French onion soup. I would have like a little more cheese.  It did have a small piece of bread and some cheese I just prefer more. However the flavor of the onions and soup were perfect.  I also tried the summer salad with vinaigrette and it was tasty.  Dinner was the prime rib. Good but a little much fat for my taste. I tried the seafood paella. Wow. That was awesome. Dessert was the strawberry cheesecake. Perfectly light and creamy yet not too rich.  Brownies were a little dry but tasty.  Side note. If you use a wheelchair or walker it is not great.  Ramps are steep and they have to bring out a portable ramp to get into the dining room.  However once there the views are awesome and worth it."}
{"text":"We made dinner reservations for Saturday night and had a great experience!  We had not been to the Wrigley Mansion since Chef Christopher took over and we were excited to see the changes.  The dining room is elegant, the service is professional and the food is fantastic.  I enjoyed a glass of the Wrigley Brut, had the red pepper soup and the duck with leeks and beets with a side of whipped gruyere potatoes - such an amazing meal!  My husband thoroughly enjoyed his filet au poivre as well - property prepared steak and he couldn't say enough about the whipped potatoes.  We'll definitely be back with the upgrade to the food and the fact that we are already social members."}
{"text":"Being a native of Minnesota and Austin, Geordies is a must see. The setting is beautiful as are all the Wrigley Mansions. Geordies widow has done a wonderful job of maintaining this huge home.

The food, service and setting are perfect. Had wine and a Prickly Paloma. First restaurant that knew what a Paloma was and also how to make it. It was perfect. 
Great wine list.I had to have the Spam Cubano with home made chips. Low sodium Spam. So very healthy.
Others had salads and Mac n cheese. Mac n cheese was large portion. Salads were excellent as well.

Staff was great. Definitely worth a visit anytime. Not just for special occasions. 

We will be back."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place to do brunch. They just revamped the menu options and redid the layout. Great view and great food is always to be expected here."}
{"text":"Came to eat with friends the environment is very beautiful, the food for the most part was great but we had to send the steak back two times and a salmon . The main waiter was great , but the waiters were not coordinated and as I had food in my mouth a waitress took my plate which was very rude . I don't know if I would try this place again . Oh and the drinks on the list,  we all got a different cocktail and they were all so bad we sent them back and got wine . Not the  greatest experience for our first time ."}
{"text":"I visited the Wrigley Mansion with my daughters to have lunch and celebrate their birthdays. We had just joined the Club for the very reasonable price of $15 annual, and as a member received free valet parking. The valet was a pleasant and professional young man, who opened our doors, provided a valet ticket, and directed us to the entrance. Once inside we were promptly greeted and brought to Geordie's for lunch at a lovely window table with a great view. 
Debby, the manager, waited on us. I informed her it was my daughter's birthday today, and my other daughter's birthday was yesterday, 17 years apart. We ordered beverages and a margherita pizza to share, and would order something more later, if needed. The pizza was amazing, with plenty of mozzarella, slices of heirloom tomatoes, basil and sauce on a wonderful crust. My youngest said it was the best pizza she had ever eaten! (and she's had Pizzeria Bianco several times!) We ate only half the pizza and wanted to take the rest to go. Debby was very professional yet also fun and personable. To our surprise, she brought out a slice of chocolate cake with Happy Birthday beautifully written on the large white plate. The girls were thrilled, blowing out the candle together. 
After our wonderful meal and time spent at Geordie's, we enjoyed walking around the museum like mansion. Many of the ceilings are beautifully elaborate and colorful, and the views of the city are fantastic.
Visiting the Wrigley Mansion was definitely a highlight to our special day together!"}
{"text":"My friends and I visited the Wrigley Mansion for Sunday brunch ($54 a person) in celebration of a birthday and we were extremely pleased! The view is absolutely phenomenal and the full glass windows let you soak it all in. The staff starts you off with mimosas, wine, or domestic beer and ensures you never have an empty glass. The buffet is literally anything you could want... and more! They have all the basic breakfast items, a pancake and omelet station, prime rib and lamb carving station, general lunch items, sampled meats and cheeses, and let's not forget about the dessert table. It started getting a little busy around 11am, so I'd recommend a 10am reservation. Keep in mind, someone at the table must be a member so come prepared to pay the annual $20 membership. Trust me, you'll be back!"}
{"text":"Was the best man in a wedding at this beautiful property. Unfortunately the filet I was served for dinner was raw in the middle, and room temp when served. This wouldn't have been an issue if I was able to get a servers attention to have it reheated. This was after the server was not willing to refill the bread bowl at the table. 

Beyond dinner, the most frustrating part was the very expensive open bar. Drinks poured were less than an ounce filled of alcohol. When multiple people asked for a stronger pour, including the groom, the bartender said \"if you help me, I'll help you\" asking for a tip. To see what would happen, I decided to give him $20. This resulted in a very strong drink, fantastic, and a fist bump from the bartender. After one more strong drink, back to the splash of alcohol. Drinking mainly vodka and Sprite, I probably would have gotten diabetes before getting drunk at this rate."}
{"text":"This was my first time visiting the Wrinley Mansion. It's absolutely beautiful. The views are amazing too. I attended a gala that my employer was a sponsor of, I was able to arrive early and walk around the inside and see all the beautiful, old decor. There is beautiful artwork throughout and vintage furniture pieces. I'd love to go back and enjoy dinner at the restaurant."}
{"text":"I love the Wrigley Mansion! 

I was there a few years ago for a wine maker's dinner and it was beyond memorable: the food, the wine, the views.

And, just last night about 12 of us gathered to celebrate a birthday. The staff were very accommodating and offered us the loft above Geordie's for a semiprivate feel. We didn't have any \"minimums\" or \"room rentals.\" Our server did a great job and got quite the work out going up and down the stairs with our drinks and food! Happy hour runs until 7 and features $5 specialty martinis, which are full size and strength! There's even a tequilla-tini that tastes like a margarita and looks like a Mexican flag!

The executive chef came up to welcome and thank our group, which was such a hospitable gesture! I told him how I enjoyed the truffle fries and the burger (see Andrew K's review - BTW, I'm the one who screwed it up by saying \"not too much pink\") and he explained how they pride themselves on knowing where all their food comes from. They even dry those apples themselves - in-house!

It's true that the place was NOT crowded, which works for me because it means I don't have to fight with anyone for a seat to watch some of the country's best sunsets over a cocktail! I really need to come here more often! I will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"The Wrigley is a great place to grab brunch!!  The views are incredible and it is always fun to walk around the mansion and take in a bit of Arizona and Wrigley gum history!"}
{"text":"I just came from the brunch at Wrigley Mansion.  I have never been so disappointed in my life.  I am a foodie and have been to The Four Seasons and the Biltmore to name a couple.  This was not even close. They charge $54.00 a person, what a joke, it is worth $20.00 if that.  The food was cold, the pancakes were awful, the seafood, SERIOUSLY, serving closed clams and mussels, the shrimp was underdone, the eggs were cold.  YUCK.  Save your money, go anywhere else.  I took 3 friends and it was almost $300.00.  I would never go back here, you are paying for the view and just to be at the mansion PERIOD. Just letting you know that I called Ben S. the manager and he never returned my call.  I was disputing this with American Express but BEN wouldn't do anything.  He is the worst manager I have ever encountered in my life.  Who goes to a restaurant and is not happy and they don't try to do something for you.  NOT BEN, he could care less and because we left and didn't complain THAT MINUTE, he doesn't care.  DO NOT BOTHER WITH THIS PLACE.  Go to Denny's you get better food."}
{"text":"A dining experience I won't soon forget. So much more than an exquisite meal; very rich in ambiance and historical background. Brunch was the highlight of my month!"}
{"text":"This place is extremely gorgeous, and I enjoyed everything about this place. However, I put a lot of weight on service and given this place is fine dining, I expected better service.

My party and I came here for dinner at Geordie's, right around sunset. Valet parking is available, but we self-parked. As we were walking up to the mansion, we were greeted by a faint smell of flowers. When I looked up, the mansion sat on the hilltop with the evening sun reflecting off its walls. There were strings of light lights hanging on the trees, and the scenery plush with green and flowers. It was a beautiful sight and a very pleasant welcome to us newcomers.

When we entered the building, there was a sign and a lady directing us to the front or main area where the hostess sat. We had a reservation and were seated immediately. We came on a weekday evening, and the restaurant was not busy so I do anticipate quick seating even without a reservation. As we walked through the building, it was fun to see the historic building and its architecture. The place is well preserved and in good condition. If I didn't know better, I might have guessed it was built in the last 2-3 decades. When we were seated, we had a beautiful view of the valley. It was almost a 180-270 degree view of the south valley. Breathtaking, I tell you. The restaurant space itself was kind of weird. There were tables in some areas and few other areas with no tables. It cheapened the place's ambiance but wasn't bad enough to make an impact.

As for the food, they served a soft cheese-containing bread, which was really soft, airy, and tasty. I drank a harvest mule, shared a spinach salad to start, had the poached and grilled octopus for main meal, and chocolate souffle to finish. All the items were well presented and good. I liked the grilled flavor on the octopus with a its texture relatively soft, easy to chew. The chocolate souffle was palatable and probably the highlight of the meal. It took about 20-30 minutes to make, but our waiter gave us advance notice so it came in perfect timing after the main meal. When the souffle arrived, the server cut the souffle top and poured chocolate syrup into its center. The souffle itself was mildly crusty on the outside, and the inside was so extremely soft, airy, agreeable to the taste. It was sweet in flavor but not exhaustingly sweet. The syrup was sweeter and complemented the souffle well.

Now, the downside to the experience was the service. Everyone was nice enough, but for its location and caliber of dining, the service was subpar. Rarely did anyone come to ask how our food was. Our waiter explained very little of the food and menu, offered little recommendations, and presented no history on the mansion. A lot of times, it is the waiter who guides and directs us through the meal. This experience left me feeling a little lost and lacked any sort of distinct features. I felt that the service was bare minimum, and it was a total disappointment."}
{"text":"Fantastic food, wine, service and ambience. Even a great happy hour! Best salmon in Phoenix! Amazing bruschetta! A wine list (book) longer than War and Peace. Perfect for a special occasion or to show off the best of Phoenix to guests. Amazing historic building with beautiful views in all sides. Do the valet parking- it's a bit of a hike."}
{"text":"THE STORY

I got an invitation from Rose with the Xplore Arizona Group to go on a tour of Wrigley Mansion. Although I had already been to Wrigley Mansion a couple times before, I thought a tour sounded interesting, as well as 50% off happy hour prices. Rose had mentioned that if you buy the social membership for $15, you would get free valet, which is normally $7. (We were told later that the membership doesn't kick in until you receive your card in the mail, and everyone wound up having to pay for valet, so make sure to buy your membership in advance of your visit.)

The group met at Geordie's Lounge inside Wrigley Mansion. Geordie's is elegant modern with gorgeous city views of downtown Phoenix. Geordie's is run by Chef Robert Nixon, who has seasonal, Italian-accented menus for lunch, dinner, happy hour or Sunday brunch. I have tried the Sunday brunch before, and it was an outstanding spread. Today I tried the happy hour specials and was very pleased with the prickly pear margaritas. Several people in the group got appetizers, including bruschetta, antipasto platter and the olives. Everything was delicious.

There are several amazing rooms adjacent to Geordie's where you can wander around with your drinks and sit around chatting with your friends.

After our appetizers, we grabbed another round, and took a tour of the Mansion. Each room was well appointed, very elegant, all with stunning city views. Many of the rooms looked like they were perfect for large formal events, and there were beautiful more intimate rooms that look perfect for business meetings or smaller functions.

WRIGLEY MANSION

Wrigley Mansion was designed by architect Earl Heitschmidt and was constructed between 1929-1931 by chewing-gum magnate William Wrigley, Jr. at a cost of $1.2 million. It has 24 rooms, 12 bathrooms and is over 16,000 square feet.

In 1992, Geordie Hormel bought the mansion and made it available for meetings, conventions and smaller functions.

Although Wrigley Mansion has so much to offer, it's a bit of an effort to get to, and there are so many other excellent venues in the Biltmore area that are more convenient. Regardless, it's a Phoenix \"must see\" and should definitely be on everyone's list of places to check out.

CONCLUSION

5/5 HIGHLY RECOMMEND

OF NOTE

*Self-parking is out front, although there are several huge staircases to get up to the Mansion.

*Valet is around back and is $7 or free with membership.

{"text":"Absolutely the worst brunch experience I've had. Flies everywhere, over cooked fish and prime rib. The building is in desperate need of maintenance. Awful, just awful..."}
{"text":"Brunch at the Wrigley Mansion is something every Phoenician needs to experience in their lifetime.  The mansion itself is a feast for the eyes, with its spanish colonial, californian, and mediterranean architecture.  Built in the late 1920s to early 30s, this 24-room home was adorned with gold leaf ceilings, making it look all the more like the castle on the hill.  

Come on a weekend and visit Geordie's restaurant, where you will have the brunch experience of your life.

Picture yourself in a sun room, overlooking the verdant neighborhoods of Paradise Valley and the Biltmore, with the glittering skyline of Phoenix in the distance.  Live piano music wafts into the room, as the smells of bread puddings and cobblers, french toasts and waffles, roast turkey and prime rib envelop your senses.  Champagne glasses sparkle on the table, covered with crisp white linens, as a well dressed waiter approaches the table to fill the bottom-less champagne flute with your mimosa.

The lavish and wickedly indulgent buffet is worth every bit of the $50 price tag.  This beats any brunch buffet in Vegas, and is gastronomic luxury at its finest.

Below are just a few of the items that my company and I indulged in, and loved immensely.

Cherry chocolate cobbler, (oh mercy, I thought i had tried it all - until i savored this) blueberry bread pudding, (the gods have smiled on thee) cherry blintz, carrot cake, caramel cheese cake, chocolate espressocake, Danishes, the lavish salad bar, exotic fruit including figs and papaya, seafood bar featuring oysters and shrimp, made to order omlets, various pastas, prime rib, eggs Benedict, and french toast.

Savor a taste of the past, bask in the views and the sun, sip mimosas until you can't stand straight, and eat lots of chocolate cherry cobbler.

Special thanks go out to Stephanie Vieira, Catering Sales and Special Events Manager, who recently sponsored a wonderful event at the Wrigley for local wedding and event professionals.  Food selection and entertainment were excellent.  I would highly recommend this facility for a romantic wedding, or just celebrating a special occasion."}
{"text":"For a special occasion (my daughter's birthday) my family made reservations at Geordie's at the Wrigley Mansion for their Sunday brunch. First of all, the atmosphere is fabulous...gorgeous old mansion with wonderful architectural accents and the view....well it is easily the best in the valley. We have been here before and usually it was crowded but yesterday it was practically a ghost town. It is expensive, and times are tough, and of course it is summer in the valley...but still there was no one in the bar and only one of the beautiful rooms was being used to seat diners. 
The brunch is lovely, with all the typical stuff: made to order omelets, salad bar, breakfast breads a plenty and the two things that are MOST important to my husband: big cold shrimp and carved prime rib! Our service was impeccable and wonderfully friendly. For a lovely, delicious brunch with some class, check it out!"}
{"text":"$150 for two people to share a hamburger and some wine.  Do I need to say anything more?   It was a nice, but not an exceptional burger; the wine was fine, maybe not $18 a glass fine? However, the view is great....is it $150 for a burger and drinks great....only if someone else is paying."}
{"text":"The mansion itself is really nice, we enjoyed touring it. The service was great from start to finish, that's where my stars come from. But the food was actually a bit disappointing. Don't get me wrong, it was pretty good, I just expected more from a menu with that kind of pricing. 

All together though it's worth a visit, but I probably wouldn't go back unless a visiting family member or friend really really wanted to."}
{"text":"Bland and expensive as hell. The most redeeming thing was the wine; some of the best wine I've ever had. Definitely will never come here again."}
{"text":"I didn't give this place 5 stars because the lady at the reservations desk was extremely rude when asked a question about the history of the mansion starting brunch off on that note we walked into the beautiful mansion and made reservations for a window seat of course really enjoying the view and mimosa! Brunch was delicious also with lots of options but they wee out of eggs Benedict"}
{"text":"OK. I'm perhaps going out on a limb here, but I feel like there should be a separate listing for Geordie's Steak since I have a different rating for my experience when we toured the Wrigley Mansion vs. eating at the restaurant. I'll leave it up to the Yelp Gods though where the fate of this listing goes!

The happy hour here is a great deal. From 3-6 and all day Wednesday half their lounge menu selections are half off, and there are also discounts on wine and cocktails. We did a self-guided tour of the mansion to work up an appetite before going to indulge in discounted drinks and food. 

All the happy hour items looked so good it was hard to pick out just one thing. I was very intrigued by the Spam Cubano sandwich. I've never had Spam in a Cuban sandwich before and it seemed fitting to use it at this restaurant since Geordie Hormel (Of Hormel Spam family fame) bought this mansion back in the '90s. 

The sandwich was a generous portion, with pressed/toasted bread, whole grain mustard, pickles, pulled pork, Spam and cheese. It was surprisingly good and one of the better Cuban sandwiches I've had in the Phoenix area, albeit more of a fusion sandwich. I loved how the fresh house-made chips that came with it was served in a Spam canister. While I appreciated that they were made in-house they were fried for too long and were tasting nearly burnt and also too oily for my tastes.

At $6 the sandwich was a great deal. Other offerings that were part of the happy hour menu were calamari, flatbread, and brisket sandwiches.

Service was excellent and Dylan was awesome. 

Note that there will be a $5 charge added to your party's bill if you are not a member of the Wrigley Mansion Club. However, you can get a \"trial\" membership for $5 that allows you member benefits for a month. Yearly memberships start at $20 (Not bad if you are going to dine or take a tour here more than once).

I had a great dining experience here overall and I'd love to come back to try more off their menu."}
{"text":"Mother's Day Brunch at Wrigley Mansion has always been a special treat for our group of ladies in years' past.  Everything about it has always been fabulous.  However, management has made some detrimental changes that has now ended our yearly tradition there.  If you go, expect cold food (that shouldn't be).  All of the most popular selections are grouped together, and everyone waits in line - a long one.  The usual breakfast foods (scrambled eggs, bacon) are next to the omelet station, which is very busy - and everyone is waiting at any given time, for some of these options.  The food has now gone downhill as well.  Potatoes were dry and cream cheese croissants were dry as well.  I ate only what was convenient to get to, as we only had a two hour window and most people at my table were up and about, waiting to get the food they had hoped for.  I just opted for ANY kind of food that I could grab and go sit down.  Cramming more people into your dining rooms and raising the price, while lowering the food quality, does not mean success.  I WILL say, however, that the service was fantastic, and our servers received a very nice additional tip as a result.  It isn't THEIR fault that management screwed up.  And they made it clear that they're keeping it this way.  So farewell, Wrigley.  It was a good while it lasted."}
{"text":"Deliciousness - 5/5
Happiness - 5/5

So glad I went to this place again. Geordies was always pretty good, but super expensive. The prices haven't gone down, but the food quality went way up.

We went for Father's Day brunch. It was $80/adult (and $40/kid) but man, it was worth it. Included all you can drink mimosas and pre-selected wine and beer (and of course non-alcoholic beverages galore). And that was all good. But the food! W-O-W!

The leg of lamb is typically the star of a brunch buffet. Here, it was one of the lesser delicious dishes. The best item was their fried chicken. I paired it with one of the best waffles I've ever had (I got a peanut butter/chocolate one) and it was like heaven. The dessert spread was fantastic, particularly for chocolate lovers. They also had plenty of healthy options beyond just salad (quinoa and granola). They do like the eggs runny/buttery, which isn't my thing. But for those who like that style, it was cooked to perfection.

The view is amazing and they let you wander through the mansion before or after your meal. My kids had fun seeing an old-time telephone and switchboard. The décor is wonderful.

And I'd be remiss not to mention the wonderful service. Our waitress was attentive and met all our needs quickly and with a smile. We actually tipped above the automatic gratuity because she was so good. 

Really fantastic stuff!"}
{"text":"I was really excited to visit the Wrigley for my friends birthday. I have been meaning to try this place for years and the Yelp hype has been pretty strong. I was immediately impressed by the staff, we had a very big group and they were attentive and got our drinks and orders in right away. The view of the city was breathtaking and I would come back for happy hour, but just to watch the sunset and a have a cocktail. 
 
That being said... Geordie's restaurant had horrible food. Honestly, one star at best. I had the Cesar salad which was fishy with stale croutons. I also tried the beet and goat cheese salad and I kept looking around for the goat cheese, I had one small dollop hiding under a bib of lettuce. The carpaccio was the worst I have ever tasted. I think the cut may have been bad and I couldn't take more than two bites. I also ordered a side of their white truffle fries; they were the only part of my meal that was anything more than mediocre. For my main I had the tenderloin and it was tough and chewy, the potatoes that came on the side were a joke. 
 
I've been told that Wrigley has the \"pay what you will\" for lunch. If they applied this to the dinner they served I would left with a much heavier wallet. All in all the over hyped experience left me quite under whelmed. Sure it is a great place to impress your out of town guests with, for the view and history alone. Just take them somewhere else for dinner (like Dick's or Café Barrio) if you want an impressive meal."}
{"text":"Sweet.  I went to the bar, Geordie's, for my first visit to the Mansion.  Had a few glasses of wine and then started to wander.  What a neat place to get away from it all and relax.  The bar menu is pretty limited so keep that in mind, oh and I hear that this place closes for special events so always call ahead. And the view is not too bad either."}
{"text":"Wow! That is all I can say. This was probably one of the worst dining experiences I have had in a very long time. My expectations were pretty high for this establishment, but it was a complete let down. 

I dined for restaurant week, so there was a nice menu to select from. But it all started off as soon as we were seated. We had a reservation and it took over and hour for our orders to be taken or drinks (other than water) to be served. Who doesn't take a drink order right away?  

After we placed our ordered, it took another 45 minutes to an hour for food to start arriving. We spoke to the manager and told them that we had been there for two hours and we were barely getting our food. He was nice and comped us a bottle of champagne. But as we ate, the food wasn't that great and the service didn't get any better. 

The dessert(s) weren't stellar either, so the overall night was something to be forgotten. I will say that I am extremely disappointed, by not only the food, but the service. We ended up having a three hour dinner! I have no idea why the staff did not realize we (and everyone else) were there for that long and try and speed up service.

I don't think I will be returning for another meal!"}
{"text":"The Wrigley Mansion is beautiful.  It was built for the makers of, you guessed it, Wrigley gum and today it the setting for weddings, Christmas parties, wine tastings, alcohol kick-off parties, group meetings or anything else people can dream up.  All of which I've been here for.

The surroundings are beautiful, but be careful to watch for signs for the parking lot or you'll just keep driving up and up until you realize that there's no way to get down.  My friend and I did this.  It was really embarrassing.  The valet guys finally had to move all of these cars just to get us out of there. And of course all the people we knew at the wine tasting saw this happening. We were the laughingstock.

I've never ate at Geordie's, but I've heard it's good. If you're looking for a spot to hold your next function, I definitely recommend this place.  The staff is attentive, the views are killer and the mansion itself is elegant, beautiful and full of history."}
{"text":"The Wrigley Mansion is not what it once was. Our one star dinner experience all started with an awful valet arrival... Then we were forced to sit in a cramped, out dated room for dinner, even though we made a reservation for the new steakhouse.  The service was average, food quality was poor and the meal was way overpriced.  It felt like we were having dinner in a stranger's house, which I guess makes some sense if you think about it.  We won't be going back unless we're forced to for a wedding or special event."}
{"text":"The ambiance and views are incredible. The food is typical brunch buffet offerings-nothing spectacular.  Service is better at Waffle House.  After spending close to $600 for brunch for a party of nine and a 20% mandatory gratuity we are accused by the grossly overweight server of swiping his Ritz Carlton pen.  It just got worse from there.  

\"Come on people this is the second time today!  This is pissing me off.\" What a class act.  Manager was summoned and he could have cared less. Not to mention the server gave us Martinelli Sparkling Cider for our last glass of champagne of the afternoon.  

Skip this place and spend your money elsewhere. It's class is just window-dressing. Start looking around and the service and food is quite unremarkable."}
{"text":"Had the best brunch! Great selection and the endless mimosas can't be beat. Service (Prince ) was impeccable, never had to ask for a thing. Will definitely make this a more frequent weekend spot. Took a tour with Ben, and told me all kinds of stuff about phoenix I didn't even know. Definitely check this place out."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try this place for years and I had a good group of girlfriends who wanted to so we finally did it. We decided brunch would best and off we went. 

It was lovely! Yes it's a little pricey (I think $49 pp) but bottomless mimosas that the wait staff is on top of keeping filled (sparking apple cider was given to the pregnant member of our party). 

Our group is a happy bunch who maybe wasn't stuffy enough for some of the other diners but our waiter made us feel right at home, joining in a joking with us. 

There were too many food options to talk about - breakfast, anti-pasto, seafood, prime rib, salads, desserts and more. 

Everything was delectable and there were mini jams and Tabasco to add to the experience. 

The view is great and the mansion has rich history. 

Suggestions : make a reservation. Valet park."}
{"text":"After touring the Wrigley Mansion, my family party of 12 dined here for a delicious steak and fish dinner. We were seated in the original Wrigley family dining room, and the porch doors were open so we could view the sunset. The room is exquisite with a massive chandelier, holiday wreaths and lights, and elegant table setting. The menu has an extensive list of \"beginnings\", like mussels and charcuterie and salads. The main entrees included a selection of a la cart filets, pork, fish, and chicken dishes. We ordered one of every side for sharing, which was the perfect amount. The service was wonderful--we were waited on hand and foot by the whole team. The water glasses were filled and empty bread plates always replenished with homemade slices. Each time a member from our party got up to view the sunset on the outdoor porch, the waitress would fold the place napkin. It's a small gesture but suggested attention to detail. This was an unique experience and worthy of a special celebration or night out."}
{"text":"The Wrigley Mansion for brunch is exquisite!  The variety and elegance of food was spectacular. The panoramic views and wonderful service made you feel like you never wanted to leave. With the one of a kind piano playing in the background and the classy atmosphere, I can't wait to plan our next Sunday brunch!"}
{"text":"Horrible brunch! $150 with valet for 2 people! Rita's Kitchen is so much better! View was beautiful."}
{"text":"Did you know Wrigley's Gum was the first product to have a bar code on the packaging?  Now you know.

Being born and raised in Phoenix, I have always heard of Wrigley Mansion but have never been to it.  All this changed when we had a chance to help photograph a wedding here!  

As to be expected, the grounds of Wrigley Mansion are gorgeous.  You drive up a windy pathway, give your keys to valet, and enter through majestic doors with a Juliet balcony set right above  it.  The first thing you see is the grand staircase, the high dome ceilings, and a beautiful chandelier.  We had arrived early and the coordinator encouraged us to explore the grounds.  We walked through many hallways, inspected some fireplaces, looked into gigantic mirrors, critiqued some creepy artwork, poked our heads into rooms with amazing views overlooking the greater Phoenix area, peered into rooms with spooky atmospheres [especially the pink bridal suite!  Yikes!], et cetera.  We even traipsed through the garden area and ooh'd and ahh'd over the views of nearby mountains.  I can see why this is such a popular venue.  The view is what you pay for.  Geordie's was closed as well as the rest of the Mansion this past weekend but I believed they re-opened to the public yesterday.

All in all, this place could use a little love in terms of renovation but everything is great!"}
{"text":"I have had brunch t this location twice. I recommend reading the body of each review before making a judgment on this location. Brunch is vastly different than a private event I would think.

I have visited at the end of January both times. Bring your sunglasses if you sit close to the windows near noon. It gets pretty bright inside. Of course you don't have to sit there either...

The brunch is vast. I highly recommend making a plan BEFORE you pick up a plate and dive in. I didn't the first time and I regret it. This second time I was prepared. Think of invading a country and you will understand the magnitude of the choices you will be faced with. Will you be making an air, sea, or land attack? Are you going to bomb first or just send in the ground troops?

When I'm at brunch, I'm making decisions about my level of hunger, if I'm in the mood for breakfast foods, and how many flavors I want to indulge in. This time I wanted to take advantage of the breakfast options that I didn't get a chance to last time. They have a pancake and omelet station that are both really interesting. I chose pancakes.

Warning: the pancakes are TINY. These aren't Denny's sized ones. They are about the size of the palm of your hand. You get to choose the additions, but get ready to come back for more as one wasn't enough for me.

Their fresh fruit was amazing.

The dessert plates are astounding. There is an entire table dedicated to ONLY sweets.

I can't speak for the meat and pasta offerings as I don't like to mingle breakfast/sweets with dinner fare. It all certainly looked good.

When you're finished, you can wander the mansion and see how the other half lived. It's a great thing to do while in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Attended private event here with many out of town VIPs.  Mansion is beautiful and the tour was very insightful.  Bar options were ample, wine was decent, and service was adequate.  The food however was a desperate cry for help.  

The crab cakes had too much filler, not enough remoulade and they were served room temperature. For the second course, it was literally iceberg lettuce salad out of a bag (you know, the kind with with the julienne carrots).  The steak was average but the fish was inedible, it almost needed the steak knife to cut through  and it was cold (I did not eat it).  Sides were asparagus and french fries for the table to share - very strange and not very high end IMO.  Desert was a very boring chocolate mousse.

If I had the chance to go back, I wouldn't."}
