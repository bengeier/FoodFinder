{"text":"Eh, pretty decent eatery. Reasonable price and portion but the food isn't anything to write home about. Portions are filling but I found the flavor of the chicken and broccoli to be a bit bland. Stay away from the bubble tea though, very very bad but the smoothies are drinkable. Sushi here is OK but with Sushi Boat two doors down I wouldn't recommend it. There are not many tables so the place is commonly full."}
{"text":"There would have been one point where I would have given Taiwan cafe five stars.  However, I felt things were going downhill there during the last year I was at college.    Not certain why -- I just realized I wasn't feeling the incentive to trek to Oakland from Carnegie Mellon as much as I used to.  In sophomore/junior year I'd eat here once or twice a month.  In my last semester at CMU -- Fall 2011 -- I think I went here once or twice.   Overall it's a good rendition of American Chinese fast food with a ton of value -- especially if you're a student and order off the student menu.  I remember it being about $7 for General Tso's + rice + soda.  The little fried dumplings are wonderful also -- I am a fan of little bite size dumplings (contrast to:  the enormous doughy dumplings of New Dumpling House) though.  The atmosphere makes this place seem like a well-hidden secret -- and to some extent it is.  Yet, at the same time,there is always a crowd waiting for food and another small crowd sitting in the few booths they have.  The fact that when you enter it looks like a liquor store moreso than a Chinese restaurant doesn't help the aura.  If you ask for the General Tso's spicy, they also make it spicy.  I definitely appreciated that!"}
{"text":"Like others have said, the food here is very good and surprisingly is pretty authentic.  I tried the dry beef chow fun and the ma po tofu with pork, both of which were cooked very well.  Taiwan Cafe uses very little oil in its cooking, which is a very welcome change.  They also have brown rice here, which is awesome (though they did forget to give me my brown rice, grr)!  Why still the five stars?  The owners here seem incredibly nice!  They noticed that they've never seen me before (I'm a visitor) and quickly struck up a conversation, something which doesn't happen too often at a Chinese restaurant (or for that matter, any place).  I can definitely see myself coming here very, very often in the future if I move here! :)"}
{"text":"This place is gross.   First, I got a spicy tempura roll that was chicken (instead of tuna).  I mean, really? Chicken?  Second, the sushi was warm.  Third, the roll that was made to replace the chicken had an eyelash in the container. And it wasn't mine.  Negative one star.    Sorry to be so harsh, but it's better that you know."}
{"text":"I waited until I graduated to post this review because it's always so damn crowded! I ate here pretty much weekly during my undergrad because it was simply the best Asian food I could find. I've since moved away from Pittsburgh, and I long for the excellent General Tso's chicken and steamed dumplings I used to get.   The staff and I got to know each other over the years as I became a regular. From my first foray though, the staff was always very friendly with me and and my girlfriend, asking how classes are going, what we've been up to and the like (as long as it was off rush times). They were  genuinely caring people who made some of the best Asian fare I've tasted in my life. And for the price!? Wow. Wow wow wow wow. When I think of Pittsburgh, this is one of the places I miss the most. It was just so consistent, so delicious, and so inviting at all times.  Call ahead and take something to go if you want something during a lunch or dinner rush, as it can get pretty packed. Or if you have some time between classes and it's not quite lunch or dinner, you can grab a snack and watch some TV.   The menu is pretty big, and there are definitely some dishes that shine more than others, but if you're willing to experiment a little, you might find something really special. Ask someone in line what they usually order or go with the favorite, General Tso's, made as spicy as you wish.   I could sing the praises of this place for pages and pages, but just try it if you like Chinese food and grease, but always thought that some places were just too greasy or made you feel bloated. (I'm looking at you, noodle shop across the street) Taiwan Cafe is pinnacle of fast Chinese food balancing speed of service, flavor, price, grease, and consistency. CHERISH IT"}
{"text":"Food is usually good but sometimes they mess up. I ordered Minced Pork over rice once and they replaced the minced pork with some fatty tissue. That was not a pleasant experience. Sometimes the food was spoiled and had a tangy taste. Service isn't so great either. I stopped going there after the lady kept going \"No cash ah?\" whenever I use my credit card."}
{"text":"Taiwan Cafe has fantastic food. They, without question, make the best fried tofu in the city. Their General Tso's sauce is to die for. They also make a mean chicken and broccoli and have great spring rolls. Also, the student special is cheap (less than $6) and portioned so that it's not too large and not too small.  Other reviewers complained about the restaurant being dirty. Frankly, it does look a bit dirty, but that's more because it's in Oakland and has been serving college students for many years. If you look closely, it's more \"worn\" than dirty. We've eaten there many times and never found stray pieces of meat or vegetables from other dishes in the food.  The bottom line is that the food here is fantastic."}
{"text":"Great prices, good food. A little scary looking, but get past the appearances and you'll have a nice meal."}
{"text":"I just went there for a snack and a bubble tea. The veggie sushi roll was tasty and only $3, great deal for the quality. The bubble tea was also good. The atmosphere leaves something to be desired."}
{"text":"I gave this restaurant five stars for one simple reason - It's the best authentic Asian street-food takeout in the city.  That, and they serve amazing tripe.  It's on the only place in Pittsburgh where I can get quick tripe for takeout and it's fantastic - as in I routinely get cravings for this dish that occupy my thoughts to such an extent that I need to go there and eat or suffer a major decrease in productivity until I do so.  The place is run by a husband/wife immigrant team who seem to have only recently landed in the U.S.  The menu is large - they have standard psudo-Chinese/Americanized Chinese fare, but they also have a great selection of authentic old-school Chinese/Taiwanese dishes.  I strongly advise going for the latter.  Recommended dishes include: Sa Cha Beef Tripe, Pork Stomach with Pickled Mustard, Hot and Spicy Squid, and Sauteed Green Bean with Pork.  The decor is, well, both scary and interesting in a grungy-urban-hole-in-the-ground-sort-of-way.  Think a dingy, dungeon-like basement painted bright pink and jammed with Asian students and doctors hunched over large steaming noodle bowls of non-familiar good stuff while homeless guys select and buy 40oz-ers for takeout with handfuls of change garnered from panhandling on the street above.    It's definitely not a place you'd take a date (well, at least one you didn't know well), but it's great for takeout and the late-work-night dinner.  I love this place, it's a largely-unknown gem."}
{"text":"When I went to school at Pitt, Taiwan Cafe was one of my favorite places to eat. Their lunch specials are delicious, cheap, and filling; what more can you ask for? I'm particularly fond of the General Tso's tofu (yes, it's not at all authentic, but it's still really yummy and you can get it spicy.) Unfortunately, I moved away, but whenever I make it back to Pittsburgh, I always stop by here. And although I haven't been going to this restaurant regularly for almost two years, when I stop by on a visit, the people here still recognize me. Now that's customer service done right. So in short, there's nice people and great food, and I can't recommend this place highly enough."}
{"text":"Worst service ever! The cashier woman was the most unfriendly person in the world, especially when facing Asian customers (she herself is Asian!). Been there 3 times until found a dead bug in my dish! Will never ever visit it!"}
{"text":"I would say the food is pretty good; however, I think it's just a bit sad the portion size compared to the amount of rice that was given. I had the pork chop over rice and granted, it was only $6 or so, there were probably a lowly 6 small pieces and a tea egg in the corner. The meat had great flavor as well as the tea egg, but the cabbage on the side? It just tasted steamed and could have used a little bit more effort.  I may be a bit hard on them because I love Taiwanese food and I come from California where Asian food is rampant, but food is food. Don't let the interior fool you. Yes, it may look a bit run down, but if you try the food, it will speak for itself. I plan on coming back again to taste other dishes and see if the portion sizes are a bit fairer. It's pretty cheap eats, I must say."}
{"text":"Like Szechuan Express across the street, the quality of the food depends largely on the item that you order (at least Taiwan doesn't have 150 items to choose from). Stick to more ethnic dishes and you'll usually be fine; if you don't know what those are, I would suggest first eliminating the typical Americanized dishes like beef and broccoli or whatever.   Noodle soups (e.g. beef), rice noodle, pork chop or ground meat rice dishes, and Taiwanese veggie dishes such as bamboo shoots are all quite good and cheap.  They also offer drinks such as bubble tea and smoothies, but cannot compare to Rose Tea in my opinion. Finally, the service sucks and the lady at the counter will often ask if you have cash if you try to pay with card first (just say no if you prefer not to pay with cash). But like most places in the area, it's not supposed to be waited on, so you can skip the tip without feeling guilty."}
{"text":"This little unassuming basement level eatery offers fast service and reasonably priced food. You can either order to-go (probably the more recommended option) or dine in and sit in their stamp sized eating area.  I've tried their fried dumplings (a little on the meager side, but at least the exterior is crispy) and scallion pancakes (too dry and flour-y, and I didn't see much scallion action) as well as their bubble tea (it's fine). I looked around at the food other people got, and the dishes look pretty standard.  The folks who work here do exude a hard-to-describe quirky charm.   All in all, Taiwan Cafe is not bad for students and people who work in the nearby businesses to drop in for a quick bite. If I have a particular hankering for Taiwanese food, though, I think I'd rather head over to Rose Tea in Squirrel Hill."}
{"text":"Hidden beneath GNC and Sushi boat is this little Oakland treasure.  It sorta feels like you are in a basement, but the food is really good. I have gotten the dragon sushi roll (huge, but amazing), spring rolls (standard, but still good) and the beef chow fun, which was probably one of the better noodle dishes I've ever had.  I saved the leftovers and devoured them a few days later - almost as good as the first time.  As with most Oakland restaurants, though, you need to get here early, as it fills up around noon."}
{"text":"Food is more Canto than Taiwanese. Owners are also Canto and not Taiwanese.  Food is slightly above the typical Americanized Chinese takeout food, given you don't actually order the takeout food. Definitely not as good as Rose Tea, but it's cheaper, faster, and closer to CMU campus.  I recommend getting the Minced Pork over Rice (comes with a stewed egg), Eggplant with Basil, and Sauteed Green Beans with Pork. They do seem to have some authentic dishes like Taiwanese Chunk Chicken (San Bei Ji), Shredded Pork w/ Bambo Shoots, Sa Cha Beef Tripe, and Fillet Fish with Black Bean Sauce. I haven't tried these dishes here, but you might want to go to Rose Tea to try them.  Bubble tea is okay. Has a slightly fruity taste to it. Actual restaurant is really small and gets kind of crowded at night with UPitt students. Overall, is slightly above average in terms of Chinese take-out food. It is cheap which fits the college student budget."}
{"text":"After reading the two reviews before mine, I had some high expectations of Taiwan Cafe. A few reasons: 1) I love Taiwanese food, 2) My dad is hard-core Taiwanese, 3) this location used to hold Winner's, where I enjoyed many good meals in college, 4) I was looking for a good Rose Tea alternative. So I went one day and had the Tofu with Broccoli (I was on a meatless lent diet at the time) and it was pretty good. Not exceptional, but then again it was a simple dish. The second time I came here I wanted to try something that I believe is a Taiwanese staple. I ordered the Pork Chop over Rice - a simple yet delicate dish. What's special about this dish is that although it's \"just a pork chop\", to get the perfect deep fried consistency takes the perfect batter, the perfect amount of batter, and the perfect frying time. That dish alone was a 1.5 star. I wouldn't order it again.   Some things I would disagree with from the previous reviews: The menu is NOT large, it is a normal size for a take-out restaurant. They have some selection of authentic dishes, but most are pretty common Chinese restaurant selections. This is definitely not the BEST place. It may be a good place to scratch an itch for some Taiwanese food craving, especially if there's a particular dish you can't find elsewhere; but, I would hope that the standard for Taiwanese food would be better. Perhaps it's such a rare find in Pittsburgh that we're lowering our standards?   Hey, there's no shame in liking a 3-star restaurant, as long as we remain honest with ourselves. Yes, I think Taiwan Cafe is good, and I will continue to eat there. But I will not give stars where stars are not due.  Other useful information: the old Winner's booze fridges still exist, so you can still choose from a huge selection of 40s. The prices are fair, especially if you get the lunch special. Order at the counter and seat yourself. And, if it's your first time there and you find yourself walking down a sketchy staircase, you're going the right way!"}
{"text":"The food is good, but the service and atmosphere is terrible.  I have been to this place a few times, and it's always slow and there's not usually a table available to sit down at.  They sell a variety of six packs and 40s to go, but beware--Boone's Farm is quite literally the top shelf.  The staff is very rude--on my last visit, they messed up my order and gave me general tso's chicken instead of tofu.  The counter lady was pretty mean to me when I asked for it to be remade.  She then proceeded to give what should have been my meal to another guy who DID order chicken (after me), but who didn't want to take it because I had ordered \"extra spicy\" and he didn't want spicy food.  The cashier laughed at him, argued with him that even medium would be too hot for him, and in the end got him take my messed up order, reluctantly.  She then proceeded to help five more people before she had the chef make the tofu that I ordered.  Like I said, the food is good, but I wouldn't go back to this place.  There are too many other Asian restaurants in Oakland where they don't make it difficult to get what you ordered!"}
{"text":"Great, great service and fast!  Sat down and in less than 5 minutes later the food came out. I don't even care if someone in the back heated it up in a microwave, for the price you pay it's worth it.   The food is pretty good, and the portion sizes will last you for a few meals. The food takes me home, but to a greasier version of home..."}
{"text":"Oh Lord. After last night's experience at Taiwan Cafe, I doubt I will EVER be returning there.  It seemed like a really normal meal--we ordered our food, the lady was very brisk and snappy, as usual.  We sat down, and waited for our food to come out. My friend had ordered the fried pork chop and everything seemed normal... till she pulled a RAW PIECE OF PORK OUT OF HER PLATE. She was horrified because she had eaten some of it.  This my dear was not ordinary slightly uncooked meat. This was completely raw--dripping, red, the whole shebang.  When she brought it back to the front, the lady took it and said they'd remake it for her.  When they brought it out, she was checking the meat to make sure it was cooked, and she reached under the rice, and PULLED OUT HALF OF THE UNEATEN RAW PORK.  The people didn't even give her a new bowl...they just put a new pork chop ontop of her plate, which had already touched all the raw meat and was all bacteria filled. And pork isn't even one of those things that you can eat semi raw (like beef). Pork is hella dirty when it's not cooked. and not only did they send it out once uncooked, which is already unforgivable in my book, they sent it out TWICE knowing what was wrong with it.  By that point, I was fed up, and I went to talk to the lady. She agreed to make my friend a totally new dish, but when my friend asked for orange chicken, she said she'd have to pay extra -_________- Like seriously? You fed my friend raw pork TWICE. I'm pretty sure that violates health codes, and you wont even give her orange chicken??!  That was literally the end of the end for me."}
{"text":"Four stars because mom  likes it. After going to Szechuan Express across the street for a few weeks, she decided to give Taiwan Cafe a try.  Mom (from Taipei) says its more authentically Taiwanese cooking (had the Taiwan pork mei fun) than Szechuan Express and worth the price premium and smaller quantity. Personally I am not quite so picky and would choose Szechuan Express to save roughly a buck a dish, larger quanity, and faster service."}
{"text":"Average american style chinese food with fair prices and extremely quick preparation. The location is a bit questionable as it is in a basement. It is usually filled with college students, but you will occassionally find an older individual working on a 40 while watching television. Tawain Cafe's charm comes from the waiter/bus boy who tries to make it a more personal experience."}
{"text":"A brief story:  In November of my junior year of university, I was waiting with a few friends of mine for a few more friends of mine so that we could all go to Taiwan Cafe (one of my friends swears by their beef and broccoli). Some Pens fans walked by and gave some foul remarks to one of us, who was wearing an Islanders jersey. Now, I'm not one to start a ruckus with others (usually), and I'm also pretty neutral towards every team on the NHL--but if you're going to dish it out, you should be able to take it. After an exchange of various heckles and uncomfortable remarks, the Pens fans leave and we're left waiting again. One of them walks back, yells derogatory remarks concerning the sexuality of all of us, and PUNCHES ME SQUARE IN THE FACE. I drop to the ground, spit up some blood, they run away, and I open my eyes to my friends beside me making sure I can stand up.  We walk in to Taiwan Cafe and they look at how disheveled I must have been upon ordering my General Tso's medium spicy student special. Immediately after ordering, they ask my friends what happened, get me some ice, pat me on the back when they bring out our food, and for the next month or so of the semester, continued to ask me \"Oh, how your face doing?\" every time I walked into their establishment.  The food is just about as good as you'll find at any similar pan-Asian style restaurant, the addition of alcohol is always a positive, it's a little shady and I wish it had more seating...but, you can't find this kind of hospitality anywhere else. They care about their business, they care about their food, and they care about you.  Neat."}
{"text":"New staff has ruined it. Some of the food isn't even passable for edible. Jury's still out on the next great hole in the wall for Chinese food in Oakland."}
{"text":"A previous reviewer claimed this is the \"best authentic Asian street-food takeout in the city\".  I'm not sure I know Pittsburgh well enough to make that claim as I've only lived here a year or so, but I will absolutely stand by it being the best Chinese food in the Oakland area.  If you're a Pitt or CMU student looking for the good stuff, this is the place.  I've explored most of the common dishes on the menu and a couple of unique ones, and I've always been really pleased.  I'm also always happy to see items offered as specials that \"take out\" style Chinese places don't frequently feature (like a sticky rice ball wrapped in a steamed leaf with chopped meats and mushrooms).  Even for those less adventurous however, this makes an excellent destination as their General Tso's and other standards are generous and extremely tasty (homemade sauces, fresh veggies, and no MSG).  Their menu is also extremely affordable, which is nice for undergrads, with some combo specials aimed especially at students (but available to anyone, they don't ask for ID or anything).  Finally, there are two nice additions that make this place a great standby.  First, they have a selection of very tasty boba (bubble tea) flavors, which I tend to expect more often at a sushi or Japanese place.  Don't be fooled though, Taiwan Cafe isn't one of those jack of all trades, master of none fusion disasters like LuLu's up the street.  Second, as other reviewers have mentioned, the place is built in the location of a classic hole-in-the-wall and still maintains a massive beer case.  So in that wacky PA tradition that prevents you from buying beer in a normal grocery store, here's someplace you can pick up your brews at the same time as some tasty Chinese food.  If you're in Oakland, you have half a dozen or more opportunities to get the same sort of cuisine, but none of them compare in quality or portions.  Skip the rest and go with the best."}
{"text":"We went there for my husband birthday. The stir fry is good and the beef noodle soup was good. The beef pancake was not fresh. But the price is good."}
{"text":"Great food and one of the best people that ever worked in the restaurant business.  Get ready to wait in line, cramped spaces and maybe even ready to share your table with a complete stranger, but the food is worth it. Their dragon roll is great, any sushi is great. The student menu is cheap and unlike other asian places very well made.  Have been going there for a while. I don't mind the trek from CMU to oakland to go to this gem.  Try it once, you won't regret it, you'll want to be back there the very next day."}
{"text":"Good food. Well, really good food.  I've never seen a place to ask how hot general tso' to be. I took medium. Next time, I'm going for spicy."}
{"text":"Taiwan Cafe is the best place you can eat in Oakland.  Maybe even all of Pittsburgh. Everything I have ever ordered from here was good.  Their sushi is delicious, fresh, AND inexpensive.    Although it looks/smells dicey on the way down/outside, you're in for a treat.  Choy is the friendliest worker you have ever met.   He will always remember you and your order.  It's a great touch.    Tcafe is a Pittsburgh staple. Go, eat, and enjoy. And then buy a six pack."}
{"text":"A little dark n dingy, but thats why we call it the Basement, or T-Cafe.  The family who runs this is great. Always consistent, and the Sesame Chicken is amazing. Crispy, and I always get extra spicy. Throw in an order of steamed dumplings, grab a 40 and enjoy. Really a hidden treasure"}
