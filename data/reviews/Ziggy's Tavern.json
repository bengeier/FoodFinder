{"text":"I've been here a few times and I think the food is great! I love that they have happy hour everyday from 5-7 with half price apps and half price drafts. And most nights they have live entertainment (sometimes with a cover$) Crowded times seem to be around 6:30-8. Overall this place is pretty cool and different, they have an upstairs lounge/cigar bar with couches and TVs and access to the outside deck. oh Friday nights is Karaoke and I've heard some funny stories, seems like a good time."}
{"text":"Food was good when it finally arrived but the service was horrible.  1st time I went with my husband, the burger was reasonably priced and service was slow.  Went back a week later and the price of the burger went up by 1.00 and it no longer came with fries.  The same burger with fries would have cost 2.50 more!  It took 15 minutes for someone to take our drink order and then 10-15 more minutes for the drinks to arrive.   When I asked about the beers, the waitress didn't know how to describe them.  A side of applesauce showed up on my husband's plate for some odd reason instead of chips.  When we got our bill, they charged us wrong.  When I questioned the bill,  the waitress told me I was wrong but then she realized she made a mistake after looking at the menu.  The hostess didn't stay at her station and the manager had to sent customers since he couldn't find her.  The food was good but because if the slow service, poor management, and sudden price changes, I would not recommend going here."}
{"text":"Been here a few times since this place re-opened as Ziggy's (used to be Magoo's, among other names).  Overall, the food is much better as this iteration.  The pot roast nachos are killer!  The owners are making a real effort to market this place via email, and for this I applaud them. Speaking of email, I was reminded yesterday that the \"Melt of the Week\" this week is the Reuben Melt.  Being in the mood for corned beef, the wife and I headed over for lunch. Soooo..............when I ordered the Reuben Melt (of the week), I was informed by the waitress that \"our sauerkraut hasn't come in yet\".  All I can say is.........LAME.....LOL. I mean, wtf.........dude.............there is a Giant Eagle about 3 minutes away........lol......seriously.  This just cracked me up.  The fact that they would actually tell their customers this instead of sending someone down the street to get a few cans of sauerkraut is so ludicrous it's comical.  They've just lost all credibility as even a wannabe serious bar/restaurant with me. Maybe next time I should call ahead if I have any intentions of ordering the \"Melt of the Week\" to see if they have all of the ingredients?  If not, I can stop at the grocery on my way........LOL One other observation:  This is Pittsburgh.  Most restaurants here have a bottle of Heinz Ketchup on the table.  Since I couldn't order the Reuben Melt, I ordered the Portabello and Swiss Burger (excellent, btw).  The burger comes with fries and cole slaw.............and apparently no ketchup.  You have to ask for it.  And when you DO ask, what do you think they bring to the table?  A good ole bottle of Heinz?  Um, nope..lol.  They bring you a little metal cup that has about 1/4 oz. of ketchup in it.  Seriously?  When did the ketchup shortage begin?"}
{"text":"I don't know what to make of this place. You can tell that they want to be the kind of restaurant where you can walk in, watch the Steelers game and make a few new friends. But their decor and food just doesn't reflect that. The decor makes it seem like it's \"one of those places,\" but their cuisine and prices don't reflect that. When you look at the menu, it seems like it will be your average American  food, but for whatever reason they decided to put it on \"little plates\" to make it look like a \"classy\" restaurant. The portions are also too small. When you order the wings, they only give you 6. Who eats only 6 wings? But the food was alright, and the prices were reasonable, so it's worth a try. All in all, it's an exceedingly average restaurant."}
{"text":"I ate here this past Thursday night with my girlfriend for dinner.  The inside of the restaurant is split up half into a bar type area and half into a dining room.  There are TVs everywhere and the dining room has a huge projection onto a screen.  The night that we went there was also live entertainment and we heard they have it every thursday and Saturday with karaoke on Friday.  My only complaint was the band was so loud I could hardly hear our waitress talk and could not understand any of the specials.  My girlfriend and I both decided to start off our evening with the beer cheese soup.  It came in a crock with a pretzel stick and man was it awesome.  Hot and gooey with a nice cheese flavor and a hint of beer.  It was perfect to combat how cold it was in the restaurant where even the hostess was wearing a jacket.  Even though it was sort of redundant with my appetizer, I decided to go with the buffalo chicken Mac and cheese which was the #1 seller according to the menu.  My meal came with a salad with which I ordered balsamic dressing.  The salad was nice but the dressing was a sesame dressing and not a balsamic.  My girlfriend ordered the salmon salad for her entree and had the same dressing issue although she also enjoyed it.  The mac and cheese ended up being good with the chicken shaved on top with a dry rub on it and the pasta with a buffalo cheese sauce on it.  The bottom line for me is that I would probably head back here in the future.  The food was good but I would probably head back on a night without live entertainment as it was too loud and I also hope the restaurant is warmer."}
{"text":"Great food and good beer selection. Live music. Games on the large projection screen and flat screens on the wall. Oh, and a cigar bar upstairs."}
{"text":"My family and I ate at Ziggy's a few Fridays ago and we left rather disappointed. It's sad, because I was hearing great reviews about the great food and drink specials.    The restaurant received a face lift where the entrance was moved for side of the building to the other, the partition between the bar and dining room was modified, and the bathrooms were remodeled.  Our service was terrible and the food was lousy. We ordered an appetizer, which I heard were out of this world, but it never came. My meal was lukewarm and my wife's dinner never came either. Our waitress blamed the mix ups on the \"system\", and the manager never came over to apologize for mistakes. I can understand being overwhelmed on a busy Friday, but that night, it wasn't that busy.   Whoever remodeled the bathrooms should consider a career change. The tiling was crocked and incomplete.    If we ever go back; it would only be for drinks and appetizers. That is the only thing I've heard good about this place."}
{"text":"I live within walking distance of Ziggy's. It was previously Fiddler's and Magoo's, both of which were supposedly shut down for illegal \"underground\" activity. I used to frequent Fiddler's both for drinks, dinner and carryout ordering but it suddenly shut down with no explanation and after months of no activity, it started being renovated into Ziggy's. Despite the remodel, the restaurant is stuck a couple decades in the past, with light wood paneling and scary looking carpet.  Honestly, I was excited for Ziggy's to open, as I would love to have a great restaurant so close to home. I visited during the opening week and was frustrated that a lot of the things they were advertising weren't available, and they kept blaming the opening instead of taking responsibility... if you're not ready to open, then don't! Strike one.  I went back a while after Ziggy's opened on a Friday or Saturday night. First of all, parking was a complete nightmare. Not only is the parking lot tiny, but it is so poorly laid out that it is IMPOSSIBLE for two cars to be driving in it at the same time! I drove in looking for a spot and literally had to drive back out in reverse to make room for a car that was pulling out. When I finally got inside with four friends, we were told there was a $5 per person cover. It was going to be $25 JUST FOR US TO GO IN? I have no idea what was going on inside for there to be a cover, but I wasn't staying around to find out. Read: Ziggy's is in the SUBURBS, a good 30 minute drive from downtown, across the street from a Sunoco and the public library. There is absolutely, positively no good reason why five friends having a subdued night in the suburbs should pay $25 to get drinks (that's not even considering the cost of the drinks!). Strike two.  I went back several months after that for lunch. The food was less than mediocre again - I wanted to give the place a fair shot after the opening was so disappointing. Also, it is incredibly overpriced for what you get. It is nothing more than bar food with what is trying a little to hard to be a twist (weird sauce and item names that make the menu hard to understand). I was shocked when I got my bill and realized I'd paid for a $6 small Caesar salad (read: side salad). Strike three.  I won't be going back."}
{"text":"The buffalo chicken mac and cheese was tasty.  Spicy and cheesy!  The crabby melt was ok.  I'm not a fan of fishy tasting seafood. The crab was a little fishy, but overall it was a good sandwich.   The place has a ton of TVs and drink specials. The staff was friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"Ive been there a few times usually its a friday during happy hour but the staff and owner treat you very well will definitely go back!"}
