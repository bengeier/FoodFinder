{"text":"Authentic Greek good without all the fuss.  The lemon  chicken with capers is to die for.  You can eat fantastic food for a great price and make some healthy choices.  Winning!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to love this place, but each time I've gone and tried the gyro I've been disappointed. Not sure what is off exactly, but it's simply too dry overall and the meat isn't very flavorful.  That being said, the appetizers and desserts I've tried have certainly met and sometimes exceeded expectations. Disillusioned with the gyros, I tried chicken artichoke sliders on my last visit; they were really good!  Being such a gyro fan though, this place should work on that dish since it's what a lot of people come in for. Sad but true, I'd rather just get a greasy gyro from Mama Pepino's for better flavor, price and portion size."}
{"text":"Stopped by for lunch after visiting Yoga Style across from the Lemon Grass, delicious food, all freshly prepared!   It's like going to a friend's place for the experience,  friendly atmosphere!   We had the Fasolakia,  definitely recommend it.  The dolmas are awesome"}
{"text":"So no shit if you like Mediterranean food try the lemon grill. Fuck it even if you don't like it go here. We were looking for a place to eat and wandered by this place and I'm impressed."}
