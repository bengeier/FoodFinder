{"text":"Good Prices, usally 3 daily specials, tons of items on menu.  The only hong kong style food place in chinatown.  I can't seem to find another.

Compared to other Hong kong style food places in Markham it just be OK."}
{"text":"Definitely a hidden gem in Chinatown. This restaurant is on a 2nd floor serving excellent Hong Kong style foods (a version of Western style foods) at a very reasonable price. You have to try their escargot appetizer, hoi-nam chicken, baked seafood with white sauce (on spaghetti) and also the daily soups that come with set meals. Very good value and friendly service. The food is freshly prepared with good portions and lots of variety. Will definitely visit again."}
{"text":"We ran away from the insane lineup at Rol San to wander down Dundas in search of a little Sunday dim sum. When I stepped up to the door of Rol Jul, I saw a single dimly lit table of people in the back. My spidey-sense tingled and we beat a hasty retreat. If there's one thing we know, don't eat in an empty restaurant when the others around it are at peak!! My friend remembered HK Harbour \"from 20 years ago\" so we stepped 2 door to the right to give it a try. It was bustling but not packed (2 good signs bc my friend's feet hurt), so we were seated right away. I did like that it was served from carts, not a la carte like Rol San where you can't see what you're getting. As each carts rolled by, the ladies told us what was on offer and we'd take or not take. I liked that the ladies gave us a brief smile. Once, we ran low on napkins and a manager dropped off more without us asking. You know there's low expectations of this type of restaurant when this impressed both my friend and I!
BTW, is my palate aging or do all the egg custard buns have a coconut flavor lately? Weird!

The food was decent, prices were good, and I'd recommend it just because we got seated right away. Sum of them you lose but dim sum, you win!"}
{"text":"3.5 stars. 

Everything's in perspective. this place would be 4 star compared to others in the area. however, compared to places uptown, it would only be 3. The food is decent, I particularly like their baked tomato pork chop on rice and portugese chicken curry. Their hong kong milk tea is good too. other items are their menu is mediocre. The place is usually not that busy which is nice because you don't feel cramped. Good prices."}
{"text":"Of the 10 dishes I've sampled here, very few are worth eating. Bummer! This is one of the only Hong Kong style \"tea restaurants\" (\"tcha chaan tang\") in downtown Toronto. Short of going to Markham, you won't find better nearby.

Unfortunately the only good stuff is:
- garlic bread (buttered heavily)
- hot milk tea (not great)
- low prices

The sweet baked ox tongue (\"gok nau lei\") is passable (sauce good, tongue bad -- better ox tongue elsewhere).

The \"daan zi\" (egg sandwich) is horrible and smothered in mayo to hide the overcooked egg. Yuck!

Biggest disappointment: \"ju pa bao\" (pork chop bun). Smothered in a sauce to hide the flavourless, overcooked pork.

Gave this place a few tries, not going back.

Note: I'm not sure on the English name of this restaurant, but it's on the second floor at 472 Dundas, up a narrow, blue carpeted staircase. It's directly above Rol Jui Seafood. Why am I telling you how to get there? I suppose because I long for a good Hong Kong style tea restaurant downtown!"}
