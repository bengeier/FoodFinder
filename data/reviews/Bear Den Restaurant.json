{"text":"I was there today with my brother to have a little get-together for his birthday at lunchtime.  This restauraunt isn't trying to be anything other than it is.  It is a neighborhood place which focuses on serving good to excellent food at a fair price.  I was surprised by the variety on the menu.  A few Columbian (Great empanadas), Polish (Some of the best pierogie I've had, recommend sauerkraut and cheese, and the potato) mixed in with all the usual American fare.  There are some items on the menu that are house specialties.  I tried the philly cheese grinder and I loved it.  My nephew had a belgian waffle and it was perfect.  I noticed they even will make you a plate of eggs benedict and potatoes at a very reasonable price.  You may need to have a bit of patience at the busier times of the day, but you will be rewarded for it.  The chef and the staff care about your experience and seem ready to go the extra mile.  I'm not a demanding customer, but if you are, I think you'll be fine too.  I was there for early lunch and they were doing a fair take-out business as well, so remember to grab a menu if you live or work nearby.   It's pretty easy to get to from 480. Take State Rd exit turn north, take quick left on Wetzel and turn right on Pearl and you will see it in a little strip on the left.  Park on the street or there is a rear door to access the place in the back lot.  Worth going a little out of the way for."}
{"text":"A couple coworkers and I decided to stop by this place for lunch, curious about the \"Latin American\" and \"Polish\" labels. Two of us got the pierogies, which were quite good; we got a sampling, but agreed that the potato/cheese/onion was the best, probably followed by the sweet cottage cheese, so definitely try those. I also had the paprikash, which was very satisfying, and the chicken empanada, which was okay but not really anything noteworthy, while the other two had the mini big poppa burgers that may have been a little over-cooked but were otherwise not bad.   Our service was good, although the food took a little longer than we had expected, but I suspect that's the result of limited staff plus doing a number of things in real-time, so it's not really avoidable."}
{"text":"Having a solid, go-to breakfast joint in your neighborhood is imperative. For the past couple of years after our favorite diner closed down, we certainly haven't. Enter Bear Den.   Okay first off, they have breakfast pierogis. HELLOOO? Breakfast pierogis!? Why hasn't this been done before? It doesn't matter, they exist now and you can have them. They come in Western, Ham, Bacon egg & cheese, sausage egg & cheese, plain egg & cheese, and eggs Benedict. Personally I went for the Eggs Benedict. Out of this world! More on the food later.   We ordered for pick up. The restaurant is cozy as another described, and hell yeah because that's exactly what I want out of a breakfast diner. The staff is phenomenal. Everyone was smiling and talking and working hard, but still taking time to interact with the customers (including kitchen). I've met the owner before outside of the restaurant, and he's a great guy as well. You can tell they really take care of their regulars here. I intend on being one!   Besides the breakfast pierogis (which will be a staple of every future order), we also got pancakes and chicken and beef empanadas. The pierogis came with hashbrowns and toast, and the pancakes with eggs, toast, and a choice of bacon or sausage. The pancakes were some of (if not the) best we've ever had. The potatoes were nicely seasoned as well. The empanadas were just okay in my opinion, but I think that's mostly because we had them to go as opposed to fresh. While I was waiting for my order,  The prices are a great value, as to be expected from a breakfast joint.   Thanks Bear Den, for filling the space in our hearts - and bellies - where Dee's Diner used to be!"}
{"text":"Took the family to Bear Den the other night as we're trying to support local businesses.  The weather was bad and we were the only ones in the restaurant.  We started with a couple chicken empanadas, which were pretty good!  We then ordered fish fry and pierogies.  My fish was tasty, but I loved the sauerkraut pierogies.  They were delish.  My french fries must have been good because I ate all of em.  The cole slaw could use a little jazz.  My dad didn't like his potato pierogies, however.  The others said their meals were just okay.  The server was fast and very friendly.  This is a nice little family run restaurant and I'd like to stop in for breakfast some time."}
{"text":"We moved to Old Brooklyn last fall and had been intrigued by the idea of such a diverse eatery in the neighborhood. We finally made it in today, Tuesday, Jan 3. This was definitely not a good day to come expecting to try the traditional Polish and PR food... I suspect the holiday weekend and season in general had left them still needing to catch up and make more perogies, rice and beans, and paprikash. It's a family place after all. They did have empanadas though, which we all enjoyed. I got an omelet and potato pancake. Yummy. Hubby liked his burger and the tater tots were crispy. I'll be back because I really want to try the other menu items. The dining room is small but well laid out and clean and cozy. I don't get the impression that the kitchen is unsanitary, but rather the range, griddle, and other equipment is older and well-used. I admire a stained-up, no-frills, working kitchen. It has soul. Nice job, Ramos family. We will be back soon!"}
{"text":"I tried Bear Den for this time and this morning and loved the place. Relaxed atmosphere with plenty of food options and great prices. I am half Puerto Rican and Polish so this place was a hit with me. I haven't had a good empanadas besides my grandmothers in years and was happy I found a place so close to home that serves them."}
{"text":"This is very small but cute family restaurant.  The interior is definitely what I would call \"cozy\".  The menu is surprisingly large and varied.  There are items ranging from Eastern European to Latin American as well as standard American fare.  On one occasion I tried corned beef and hash and it was totally amazing. However, another time I had cheese pierogi, which I didn't care for.  I felt they were overly fried and the cheese was runny. Other people with me really enjoyed their meals.  I'll definitely be back again."}
