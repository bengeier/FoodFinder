{"text":"This is mine and my wife's favorite seafood place.  Very clean great menu, food taste great. if you visit try the steamed bucket w/lobster and crab legs delicious."}
{"text":"Let me preface this by saying that our food was good.  Not great, but good.  Our server seemed a little confused and spaced out, but even that was tolerable.  The real reason for the two stars was the owner.  I ordered crab legs and they were nice sized, well seasoned and cooked correctly. However, the so called clarified butter was anything but.  It was rancid, cold and not in the least clarified. It had a definite and unpleasant smell and taste.  I used a little of it, but just could not eat anymore.  After dinner, I took the unused portion to the front and asked for the manager.  The cashier asked me what was wrong and I told her to smell the butter.  She did and made an awful face. She went to get the manager and he came out and I told him about the butter.  He said that the butter was melted every other day and that was what he used throughout the restaurant.  I told him it was bad and he was going to make people sick.  He told me that he had smelled it and even tasted it, and it tasted fine to him.  I told him again that he was going to make people sick and then he said that the butter came in \"pre-clarified\" and they heated it up before service.  This butter was the consistency of pudding when it hit my table.  Clarified by definition means clear or strained.  Clarified butter should look like oil and have no solids in it at all. I wasn't asking for a discount or a deduction, I really just wanted him to check his product so he didn't make people sick.  Just be aware of owners who neither know nor care about the quality of their products!"}
{"text":"Let me preface this by saying this review is solely based on one issue and one issue only, the chemically engineered so called butter!  Food was good, service was great!  I sat at the bar so I had full attention of the bar tender each time I visited.  My only issue is you serve BUTTER with seafood not butter flavored vegetable oil.  It,whatever it was, even returned to a solid state before I could do my damage to my crab legs.  So if you by chance are reading this, return the \"butter\" it is simply a nasty look a like!"}
{"text":"Good food; comes out hot.  Standard fare for a mid-range seafood place, family friendly, casual.  Good value for the money.  Friendly wait staff; prompt service."}
{"text":"Went last night, oysters .80 each. Ordered a dozen raw, they were ice cold which is great, but mine were FROZEN! Unbelievable! The waitress came back twice to check on our table of 4 and then never returned. No one checked on us to refill our drinks. I was drinking a Sam Adams and they never asked if I wanted another. We will give it another try but first impression wasn't great."}
{"text":"The shrimp cocktail appetizer was awful. If you were to put a deflated ballon in your mouth and chew on it, that is what their shrimp tastes like. We returned the shrimp and it was removed from the bill. There were four of us and not one of us ate our meal. After only a few bites each we were all eager to leave and spent quite some time utilizing the restrooms as soon as we got home. They serve better seafood at Captain D's. Our meal was $75. I will never eat there again and I would not recommend this establishment to anyone. Not even my worst enemy."}
{"text":"We went to eat on a Sunday, the restaurant was not very busy. We ordered Weight Watchers teriyaki chicken with steamed vegetables and sweet potato, whole fish with side of loaded baked potato and green beans, and coconut shrimp. The food was flavorful. We were happy with the size of our portions. Our waitress was attentive and nice. Will come back in the future."}
{"text":"This place has an ant infestation and the management is aware. We noticed several ants crawling on the wall near our table then saw the container of sauces and condiments on the table was full of ants. We wont go back here"}
{"text":"Food was good but the service was a little slow. Nice atmosphere & friendly staff. We will definitely go back again."}
{"text":"Place has gone downhill since the name change. Tonight, no Crablegs, Mac and cheese and will not swap skin for skinless flounder. Since they have others times but not tonight. Also, the hush puppies taste different. Ok but different. Will be our last night."}
{"text":"Okay, we should have known when we asked for unsweet tea and got sweet it wasn't going to go well. The coconut shrimp were pretty good for the appetizer, and my fried combination plate of catfish,  filet of flounder, and oysters was \"Okay\", but my girlfriend got the crablegs and although she said they were good, the butter was not. She thought at first that since it was the first time she had crablegs seasoned with Old Bay, maybe that was the reason for the \"different\" taste. But after eating some of the meat plain, she asked me to smell the butter.it was definitely \"off\". We took the container of butter to the register to pay, and she asked to girl checking us out to smell it. She did, and her nose curled up and immediately asked if we wanted something knocked off the bill. My girlfriend said \"no\", but asked to see a manager. She left and returned with a gentleman that introduced himself as Alex, the owner. We explained our experience so that someone else should not get sick,  and all he did was defend their process and supply without regard for the fact that we were trying to get him to investigate so that no one gets sick! He did not even offer to knock anything off the bill, and we weren't looking for him to, the crablegs were okay, just not the butter! We will definitely not be going back because of this, not because of the food or the not so good service by our waitress, but because of the way \"Alex\" handled the issue!"}
{"text":"Captains Galley is an excellent little restaurant in Concord.  It's usually very busy because the food it great.  I've also utilized the bar before, they have reasonable prices and good drinks with even better service.   They give you some pretty good hush puppies (for free) before your meal, as many seafood restaurants do.  I enjoyed their fried pickles, as well.  Their portion sizes are a little smaller that some seafood restaurants, while the prices are about the same... however- I do think the quality is higher here than other comparable restaurants.    Service is good, food is great.  I'd recommend a visit if you're in the area."}
{"text":"Kind of blah. I had the combination of broiled scallops and large shrimp. It was about 6 pieces of each for $16.99. Seemed kind of high priced for what I received. Probably won't go back."}
{"text":"We have been going to the Captains Galley for a while now, we love it. You start the meal off with some tasty hush puppies, and I am picky about how my hush puppies taste, they are very good, the kids fight over who gets the last one. The service was quick, my salad was fresh, the baked sweet potato was amazing! The kids spaghetti must have been good because my child inhaled it! Over all we all really enjoyed our dinner and we will be coming back often!"}
{"text":"We were in town for an event and wanted something simple, good and reasonably priced - and we found it! Spending a lot of time in Savannah has made us wary of seafood located \"inland.\" But our party had an assortment of oysters, shrimp and fish all fried to unhealthy perfection. Fresh, cook just right, you cannot go wrong!"}
{"text":"Fried chicken coating was very good, but, the meat (white meat) was on the dry side.  Onion rings were hone made, I give extra credit for that. Unfortunately they were served cold and approaching greasy. Hush puppies were complimentary and good with the exception of the surprise jalapeño bits. Good if you like jalapeños I guess. Service was great, restaurant was very clean.   PS. Booths are tight for anyone of medium to large girth.  Tables are fixed so you can not move it to one side.  Ask for a table instead."}
{"text":"This place is ok nothing to rave about. Don't bother getting the Mac n cheese unless you like Kraft Mac n cheese. Greens were good. I had it with flounder and jumbo shrimp."}
{"text":"Ok we went here on Sat night for my sisters birthday because Razzoos had an hour wait time. Nice building, no music only constant yelling from the kitchen and dishes making noise. Ok I'm ok with that because we were literally seated next to the kitchen.  Then it happened, the waiter came, nice young man however his apron was so dirty then when I looked up his fingernails were black with dirt. Only shame stopped me from walking out after we had ordered. Then later on before he brought our food, he was bussing a table and pushing the trash cart. It's only by the grace of God we all did not become ill.  The burger I had was good but the utensils should be thrown in the trash along with the cups. Bus boys should not be waiters unless given a clean apron and washing their hands. I will not be going to this restaurant again, I feel like vomiting just thinking about it."}
{"text":"Went to try the crab legs and was not disappointed! They were seasoned with a spicy old bay or something similar and the potatoes had the same spice. Very good and price was very reasonable."}
{"text":"OK look... its fried ( mostly ) they have non fried items but, like I always say do not go to a burger joint and order a taco . This is fried pretty well if fried is your taste I mean its not dripping with grease and is crisp breading. Hush puppy's well you can get the same ones in the frozen food section.         Portions are large devil crab its nothing but stuffing could not find the crab the clams are well a little too cooked . Popcorn shrimp is good and the fish is good and tasty the tatter wedges are pretty nasty I think they cooked them from the left over baked tatters. Service is very good and this is a nice shiny New place it seems at a great location.... location location location. They have daily specials.. All in all Pretty tasty if fried is your cup of tea  sweet tea that is..."}
{"text":"Eh,  everything was slightly below average. Not terrible. Fried green beans were soagy and chewy. The fried oysters, clams, shrimp and scallops were edible.  Service was fair."}
{"text":"As most know, anything friend is yummy and I enjoy the fried seafood at Capt. Galley. The salt & pepper flounder & shrimp are perfectly seasoned. They always have daily specials that a reasonably priced for families. Fast, friendly service and great prices combined with tasty seafood will keep me coming back."}
{"text":"As we were seated at table we were immediately greeted by our waitress to take our drink order.  She quickly returned with our drinks and complementary hush puppies and took our order.  She suggested the broiled haddock for my wife.  I knew what I wanted.  This waitress knew her menu.  We were both satisfied with our food and our friendly service.  The price was very reasonable.  Our fish plates were $7.99 each.  Not bad for dinner!  Our drinks were $1.99 each. I generously tipped my server since she was so attentive.  We still made out with a great meal for the price.  The dining area was clean.  The restrooms were a little dated but well kept.  The posted sanitation grade was 96.0.  I felt comfortable with the level of cleanliness here."}
