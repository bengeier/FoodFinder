{"text":"I stopped in for a quick to go order of papusas from Salvadoreno Restaurant. I was greeted by a friendly server who promptly took my order and I was out the door 15 minutes with my delicious papusas in hand. I enjoyed each bit of the savory papusas! I loved the ambiance of the location and watching the workers bustling about in kitchen.  I  Papusas!! I  Salvadoreno Restaurant!! I will be back!"}
{"text":"The food was quite authentic however some of the dishes were extremely salty.  The downside was the service.  Our server was pleasant but we waited nearly 50 minutes for our food to arrive and still they forgot a couple dishes.  The family next to us was having the same issue and it wasn't like the place was over-packed."}
{"text":"The pupusas are my favorite! The only reason I keep coming back is the food and definitely not the service. Today we arrived at the end of the church/lunch rush and found seating by the door. We were greeted promptly and that was the end of hospitality. Our server took orders and 10 min later my son's food arrived (chili relleno which he devoured) and then another 10 minutes later the rest of us were served. My Mother's order was wrong and server never came back by. Empty drinks and in need to to go box we flagged down someone for the check. I love the food there and have been eating there for several years. Don't go if service is important to you"}
{"text":"We ordered pupusas and tamales pisques. The pupusas are great, but the tamales weren't good at all. Tamales pisques are suppose to be made of pisque masa and they made it with regular masa, being a Salvadorean restaurant I would think that the food will be authentic."}
{"text":"Awesome food! Service not so good. Theres empty tables and the young lady gets behind in orders and messes up. However very friendly not rude by any means! Love the cooks!! Food is very fresh and hot.  So if your looking for the food more then the service this is it =)"}
{"text":"Always delish and customer service is wonderful!!!! Been to other Salvadorian restaurants (Elainas) it's horrible there.  This one is the best I've been to in the valley I will go back soon. Thank u"}
{"text":"I wasn't sure how to rate it, the popusas are great, 5 stars,  everything else is 2 stars,  including their cumin'd out, watery salsa. The popusas are good enough to make it worth a visit on their own, steak and cheese is my favorite."}
{"text":"Poor service. Horrible taste for the food. There were two employees at the counter that let me stand there for about 15 mins till they acknowledged me. They rolled their eyes at me when I asked for an explosion about some items on the menu. They served two other families that came in after me before I was served.  The horchata tasted like peanut butter toilet water. It was brown in color. I told them this was not even close to horchata and they told me I didn't know what I was talking about and it's always brown. If you habe never had horchata, its white and sweet. They gave a cup of toilet water put in a blender with sour peanut butter. There are at least three other restaurants in the area the server similar menu items."}
{"text":"the food is delicious, the place is clean with plenty of tables they do take a while to serve your food but that's expected if you want fresh food. The only thing I don't like about this place is that they charge the tip on your credit card and the amount they want to charge so on your receipt it says one amount but when they charge the C.C. its a different amount look at your bank statement, and they do this when is more than 5 people. We are a  family of 6 my husband and my 4 children under 10. I want to be able to make the decision of how much tip to leave."}
{"text":"Worst customer service ever. As we looked over the menu we where told if we don't hurry up she would skip us. Don't think we would come back!"}
{"text":"Salvadoreno # 2 is a very plain, very simple restaurant without much in the way of decoration and could easily pass for a laundromat with its flourescent lights, high ceiling and tiled floors were it not for the food being shuffled back and forth.  What the place lacks in atmosphere, however, it makes up for in its food.  To be sure, Latin American cuisine --- for the most part --- shares the same distinction as Mexican food --- for the most part --- in that its very heavy on fried foods, carbohydrates and fat.  So, if you're a diabetic and/or have cholesterol issues, this is isn't somewhere you'd want to visit on a regular basis.  For a people, who worked hard in the fields and who needed an inexpensive way to fill their bellies, this kind of food did it.  Unfortunately, that doesn't carry over well into a prosperous and mainly sedentary society.  If you haven't tried Salvadoran food before, do not assume it's just another offshoot of Mexican; it isn't.  You will, of course, find some similarities, but there is much more of a concentration on yucca roots and potato than in most forms of Mexican food (with maybe the exception of food in the Yucatan).  The pupusas are the obvious star of this place; they remind me of a cross between a knish, a potato pancake and a tortilla (stuffed).  Quite tasty, though, again, greasy and more carbs than you can shake a potato at.  I have no doubt believing there's a fan club of sorts for pupusas.  They're cheap; filling and delicious.    If you're looking to get away from fried foods, they do have grilled chicken and fish plates that aren't fried, but there's a reason why they're a lot less popular than other items on the menu cooked in ways the average, fat American shouldn't be eating.  And, as hinted at in other reviews of this place and others like it, if you don't speak Spanish, you may have some \"challenges\".  That should not dissuade you from visiting, though.  I like those challenges, because I'm studying Spanish.  If you aren't, you can always point to things on the menu, which are described in both Spanish and English.  The homemade flan is quite good, by the way, and not at all \"slimy\" like most flans you find out there (\"creamy\" would be more accurate).  You'll see signs on the walls that state, \"Prueba nuestro nuevo flan casero!\" (try our new, homemade flan!) and you should."}
{"text":"I love this place! Food is great staff is friendly. I'd eat here everyday if I could!!"}
{"text":"Wash looking for some Pupusas. Coming from Los Angeles, I wanted just a hole in the wall style place that serves your casual home style salvadorian meals. Had the \"revuelta\" pupusas and fried plantains. They were great. So was the waitress and staff. plus this place is cheap."}
{"text":"The food was eh okay. I wouldn't say authentic, the pupusas were a little bland. And the pupusas see chicarron tasted more like chorizo. They take forever to make your food and the customer service was one of the worse! The waitress gave faces when you asked a question about the menu and then when we needed something we waived her down acknowledge us turned around and didn't come back. The prices, the wait and the food are not worth it."}
{"text":"Drove an hour from north scottsdale to visit this place and I have to say as a picky Salvadorian eater this place passed the test. The pupusas and Curtido were good:) the service was slow and therefore the 4 stars."}
{"text":"I have been here few times. The food no complaints here, a glass a water Eww more like the Faucet Water. Wont talk bad about this place , just the waiters need some Energy Drinks , they look lost, there is no organization when they take orders or check on the customers. But now, I will order by phone an hour ahead , pick up my order and eat at the comfort of my Home."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place for pupusas. I normally get the bean and cheese or revueltas. The beans are delicious and so are all of the toppings for the pupusas. The fried bananas and corn tamales are also really good.  I would give this place 5 stars since the food is great however the service is normally not so great. My mom and I usually go eat here and she ordered some of the fried bananas which tasted like burnt oil, she attempted to return them and they brought them back saying they just changed the oil and still charged us for it. In addition to that I attempted to use the 10% off for checking in through Yelp and the lady helping us did not know how to properly use the cash register and cashed out tab before applying the discount. They stated we could no longer use the offer which expires within 3 hours of check in therefore I can no longer use it."}
{"text":"So good here. Authentic pupusas from El Salvador, and my favorite soda called Supercolachampain, also from El Salvador. They make the food fresh to order, but the wait is not long. I do recommend the mixed pupusa, which has more ingredients than the single ones. Very good and very filling, and inexpensive to eat here too."}
{"text":"Love love this place. 5 star rating is for the delicious, fresh pupusas! Service is usually just fine (we've never had a bad experience being served promptly)."}
{"text":"This place was a gem. I looked when I first moved to the area and wasn't able to locate anything but when I found this place I was sold. They are super friendly and it has a great family like atmosphere inside. If the main dining area is full they are willing to open up the second one which is also great for families.   The food was on point! All made to order and very delicious. They stuffed them well and the curtido was super fresh. We most definitely be back soon and often!"}
{"text":"The food is good,there is no question about it. The popusas are on point! Just the plain bean and cheese ones! We also ordered casamiento and that was also great with crema and a side of queso... the service is hit or miss, I have been coming here since I moved to Phoenix 5 years ago and today I had great service.. and I think that is the first time I can say that.. I hope they keep that up but no matter what the food will keep me coming!"}
{"text":"Terrible  service  the workers seem to busy. The food is good but the serc is terrible."}
{"text":"I love coming here. The service is great. The food is delicious . I don't speak Spanish but I have no problem here ordering and they treat me good. Price is stair."}
{"text":"Very good food with authentic pupusas  great quality menu I'll say that's is very complete place to enjoy what is salavadorian recipes"}
{"text":"Looking for some awesome grub? They have some amazing pupusas!!  I went here on my lunch break and ordered the 3 pupusa combo. I got the mix ground pork with beans and cheese, a black bean and cheese, and a spinach and cheese. They were so fantastic! I feel like my taste buds have been dead for month and have now been awaken!"}
{"text":"First walking in I was hesitate . It looks really dirty and in poor condition . The service was horrible . We were seated and took about 20 minutes for someone to come and take our order . People who came in after us had their order taken before us. When we arrived there was about five tables that still had dirty plates on them . When we left they were still there. They had probably been like that for an hour . The food was good but the sides are portioned very poorly . I really don't recommend this place. Go someone where else . The Service sucks!!!!!"}
{"text":"I'm obsessed with these pupusas!! Every single one i've tried is delicious, the food is very authentic and really made with love. Chicharron con queso is my favorite. The staff is very friendly and prices are good. I've been coming here for years for a very good reason!"}
{"text":"I've been to this restaurant many times and the experience has always been the same. You walk in, get seated, you order your drinks and then get stuck waiting forever to get your food order placed in. Now the food is good and that's really the only reason why I kept going back regardless of how bad the service was. But yesterday was just too much.  I decided I'd take my parents out to eat and this place was the spot we all chose. We get in and no one is there to greet us or seat us so we take it upon ourselves to just choose a table and sit down. About 5 mins go by and finally a lady comes out from the kitchen area with menus to greet us at the table. She gives us the menus and quickly walks away not giving us the opportunity to even order drinks.  We sat there for 30mins and no one ever came back out to offer us anything. There was only about two other tables occupied so we couldn't understand what was taking so long. It was around 3pm so it was around a time where the church rush on a Sunday clears out.  We ended up walking out because we were too hungry to keep waiting. Especially knowing how long they take to bring you out your order once it's placed."}
{"text":"I love their popusas! They are just a bit on the expensive side $2.30 each. Their Chicken Salad is also very good."}
{"text":"Was reluctant to come here , because some of the reviews were so negative regarding customer service. About how rude and slow the service was. And how they automatically charge you a gratuity. However most of these negative reviews said the food was great. So we gave it a try. Upon arriving we were greeted by a courteous hostess and promptly seated. The waitress was also very nice and courteous. We placed our order knowing that the food is made on request so I was expecting a long wait. But was not that bad after all. We had pork popussas . That are to die for will definitely be coming back. Good job folks . Great service and awesome food."}
{"text":"Pupusa addict back... I've visited this location a few times since my last review and had a few things to say...  They are starting to take a while to serve people. The past two times i have went we waited quite a bit for our food, yes we are glad business is booming, how about hiring more people please? Thank you :)"}
{"text":"This rating is based on how much I enjoyed the meal. A friend has been telling me I needed to come here for the papusas and I'm glad I did. They were good, especially the cheese and corn. This was my first time trying El Salvadorian cuisine and I enjoyed it very much. We will be back!  I see some posts about long waits for the food. We had the same experience but I'm totally okay with that because it's all made fresh to order and the place was busy. Our server was as sweet as could be.   They could try sprucing up the place a little, but that's about it. A good place for a hearty meal. I love Papusas!"}
{"text":"I love this place. Not just because I'm from El Salvador, but because they always have great music on and the food never fails. All my favorites. Of course, give a cheese pupusa and 2 revueltas. Yummmm my hubby is from Washington State and he loves them. His favorite is the pastelitos de carne. They are friend crunchy beef stuffed pastry with veggies. Everything so good!!!"}
{"text":"Honestly I've never had bad service here. Idk what's up with these bad yelp reviews.  I've been going for a while now. The popusas \"fuego\" style are my favorite. Chicharrón and cheese have to be the best. They got tons of beer selection. Great place for lunch or for a couple of good popusas, beers and good service."}
{"text":"BEST POPUSAS IN TOWN QUALY QUALY!! Service is great sometimes you may wait a little longer for your food but it's definitely worth it FRESH AUTHENTIC POPUSAS!! No place better than this location !!! #salvadoreno #2 take my word for it, delicious."}
{"text":"Really happy we discovered this restaurant! They do serve alcohol, but not until 5pm on Sundays. My boyfriend settled on the Famosa beer because they were out of the pilsner. He was happy with the substitution.   A different server was sent to our table because she was the best English speaker and she was fairly helpful. There was a slight miscommunication about our order, but I think that was due to her being distracted and not a language barrier.   I was shocked to see \"ask about our vegetarian and vegan options\" stated right on the menu! Upon asking our server about said items she seemed a bit confused but recommended the platter. It is mostly vegetarian to begin with and we got the small amount of meat that did come on the plate on the side. We also ordered the ceviche platter. The ceviche platter apparently won \"Phoenix's top 50 dishes\" a couple of years ago. My boyfriend got a side of meat pies.  Food Breakdown: Ceviche Platter: Absolutely delicious! With avacado, large grilled shrimp and small shrimp, lettuce, tomato, onion, and plenty of citrus juice. Mmmm!  Platter: Fried yucca, 2 papusa (one with meat and cheese and one with just beans), a meat pie and a potato pie, a coleslaw-esque side dish, a tamale, a small serving of pork, fresh plantain chips, and a dessert made of rice flour. Quite good and one of the few veggie friendly items on the menu.   Meat pies: I hear were very good.   Note: they also have fresh fruit juice drinks which they make to order. I ordered the turmeric drink and it was SO GOOD! It had bits of fruit and seeds at the bottom. It was not too sweet and very refreshing :)"}
{"text":"I work out at the gym next to this place and have been meaning to stop by because I love pupusas! This place is great and I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Food was delicious!!! Service was really slow! We sat at our table for 12 minute before we got greeted."}
{"text":"Popusas de chicharon con queso (pork and cheese) are the best! Ohh and the salad they give you on the side is also some of the best I've had. All of the popusas are made to order so it might take bit eat a little snack if your really hungry. They're hand made. The best thing is that you can see them making them if you stand by the cash register.   They are always very nice it almost feels like your family here. Being Mexican we don't really make popusas so at first I didn't know what I was ordering they will definitely help you out.   Enjoy"}
{"text":"Best pupusas! it gets pretty busy which means real slow service."}
{"text":"I work down the street from this location and I'm glad I do! They have a good selection of pupusas and all of the ones I have tasted haven't let me down.  My favorites are the chicharon and queso as well as the shrimp pupusa.  They are served with some tasty black beans and some rice.  Both of these are very different from what you get in a Mexican restaurant.    To drink I ordered horchata, which I guess in El Salvador is different from Mexico.  It has a slightly nuttier flavor but it's still very good and refreshing.    Next time we go back, we will try one of their entrees (with a couple pupusas on the side) and see what else this Salvadorean cuisine has to offer! If it's anything like the pupusas, I am sure to be satisfied!"}
{"text":"The Pupusas were ok but the rice and beans were amazing! It's a little family run business with friendly service and food you don't find on most menus. Will be back to try more items"}
{"text":"3.5 stars, this is one of the rare occasions I decided to round up instead of down.  After having a couple of Papusas at restaurant #3 on Central during the art walk I had been meaning to get back and try some more stuff.  So today I finally decide I am willing to make the drive over from Glendale and check the website and realize this location is really much closer.  I gave up the opportunity to try the buffet, which is only at the #3 location, for the convenience of the shorter drive.  This location is at the end of a strip mall in a part of town where English is not necessarily spoken or understood.  I walk in to the well lit and brightly painted restaurant and am greeted by the waitress, bus person, cashier.  It goes like this;  her:Hola Me: Hi her: Habla Espanol o Ingles? me: I don't speak Spanish her: (look of horror in her eyes as she realizes we will not communicate well) Are you taking out or eating here? (In Spanish) me: (the only word I understood was aqui) I am eating here and points to row of tables. her: Waves me to toward a row of tables, obviously inviting me to pick one.  She brings me a menu and points out the Papusas and I point to one of the entrees, not having read the descriptions, on the menu and ask of those things with the entrees are also Papusas and she informs me they are tortillas.  I ordered onion chicken ($9.95)and a medium Horchata ($1.75).  In El Salvador Horchata is made from Morro seed rather than rice which gives it a different flavor than the more common version found in Mexican places.  Let me assure you it is still a tasty drink.  I thought the chicken breast was a bit tough but it was quite tasty.  The meal comes with rice, beans and tortillas all of which are different than their Mexican counterparts.  The tortillas are the same biscuity type used to make Papusas and are really great at sopping up the juices from the onions and sauce.  I left full and happy.  I never heard a word of English spoken in the building but it did not provide any barriers to ordering/eating.  We each understood just enough of each others language to communicate.  When I went to pay the bill there was a manager in the door way to the kitchen and it was my guess she was bi-lingual and could have translated.  There was a steady usage of about 4-5 tables the whole time.    While Salvadoran food is not real common in the states it certainly rates an additional choice to add to the list of ethnic restaurant options.  And it is affordable.  There were several items on the menu without meat.  If you are gong to use an online menu the PDF version is much more accurate as to description but you will want to print it out as it is sideways on the monitor."}
{"text":"My friend invited me to eat and I had no idea where we were going. Boy was I delighted that we ate at this place! Good was amazing. I was really impressed! The mix pupusas were my favorite! Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Food is average but restaurant is horribly unorganized. Staff was rude, and it took 5 employees to find someone that spoke English to help me out. On top of that, they had flys swarming all over the place and in the kitchen too. They left food sitting out on top of that. Disgusting."}
{"text":"First impression: I ask the waitress about a chicken dish, she couldn't figure it out, then I politely said \"Sorry, I'm not Salvadoran, so I'm not really familiar with it.\" Then she implied that that was the purpose of the menu, saying: \"That's why you have to read.\" Then she giggles and offers \"sort of\" an apology. So customers service has to be fixed. Now the food: Tortillas, rice and beans, on point, onion chicken (pollo encebollado) a little cold and dry, I've tried this dish with dark meat, it comes out better. Horchata is pretty good."}
{"text":"Great place, fast service, clean. Horchata and fruit water are authentic and delish! This was my 2nd time here. Tried pupusa for the 1st time, yummy!"}
{"text":"Visite este lugar con unos amigos y el servicio que ofrecen no es muy bueno.. la comida está aceptable. Pero lo que colmo mi paciencia fue a la hora de pagar.. éramos 6 personas 4 adultos y un 2 Niños y uno de mis amigos pidió cuentas separadas. Mi amigo pago con su targets y yo cash.. mi cuenta fue de 51 dólares yo le di 60.. al regresar la mesera volvió con un recibo y queriéndome forzar que circulara unos de los porcentajes para el típ.. yo no tengo ningún problema dejando tip.. lo que me molestó fue la actitud de la mesera.. haciéndome sentir presionado.. creo que no era la manera correcta de pedir el tip.. forzando a los clientes.. definitivamente no vuelvo jamás por este lugar corriente y groseros"}
{"text":"Long wait for the food and hardly anyone there speaks English.. Just point to what you want on the menu and you're set.  But I must say.. Food was delicious! Chicken pupusas, rice, verbs, queso, fried chicken, platanos. YUM"}
{"text":"Great authentic salvadorean food. I recommend the pupusas revueltas. Amazing customer service and great atmosphere. Very inviting. Eddie the manager is extremely professional and pleasant."}
{"text":"This place is great. The papusas are fantastic and so are the banana leaf tamales. We had the sampler platter once to try some different things and everything was great. Service can be a tad slow so don't be in a hurry and your patience will be rewarded. Different flavors from Central America. Yay!"}
{"text":"The food is good.  I'm writing the review due to the poor customer service something  I'm pretty big on. I walked in and didn't get acknowledged and greeted until 15 minutes later. I was standing right in front of the register, the cashier was too busy figuring out numbers.   I get it, they have to ring up and check out customers but a \"I'll be right with you\" would have been great and I wouldn't of started this review. A gentleman walked up to her for his ticket she helped him and then she walked over to get the rest of his party to charge them.  Still no a \"I'll be right with you!\"   The front face (cashier) of the business still has not greeted me.  The girl who's going around cleaning tables was the one who asked if I've been helped yet.  I'm just picking up food, I can't imaging how long it would be if I came in to dine in. The cashier finally spoke to me so that I could be charged."}
{"text":"Found this restaurant on the Yelp search. We are Salvadorean and love to find Salvadorean restaurants anywhere we go. The pupusas revueltas are pretty good. They have great flavor and have a good amount of stuffing. We also had platanos plate and they were good too. The beans that came with the order were delicious. I had to try the Altole de elote. There is one place in California (home) that is was made perfectly. This place comes in second. It had the right amount of sweetness and isn't too thick or too thin. The girls serving were courteous and service was quicker than I expected."}
{"text":"Goodness gracious. I don't even know where to begin. To make it quick and simple, here is the list.  Pros: Good food. Con: About an hour and a half wait for the food. Had to hunt someone down to order the food. Had to hunt someone down to make sure they remember our order. Had to hunt someone down to get the check. The table that sat after us got their food first. The table that sat after us got their check first. We didn't give her any tips and she gave us a dirty look.  Now, I normally give about 30% tips to every establishment I go to. Even when the service was \"eh okay\". But man, this was bad. I understand that it was the day of the Pupusa's festival and I was expecting a long wait, but not almost 2 hours of waiting. If I have to hunt someone down three times to get my stuff, that's an automatic $0 in tips.  I would've received a faster service if I went outside and eat at the vendors instead. Totally regret not doing that.   Would I go back? Nope. I rather go to the Salvadorian Restaurant on 107th and Indian school."}
{"text":"Tried this place on my daughters recommendation. I have to say it was delicious. Waited along time to eat, but well worth the wait.  Staff was friendly and the place looked like a typical hispanic restaurant. But, they could of kept the place clean even if they were busy.  Now to the food! I ordered the 3 pupusas combo with carne asada and shrimp. The shrimp pupusa was a little disappointing, I was expecting chopped prawns but got those tiny little shrimp from the cup of noodles. The carne asada pupusas (2 of them) were very good and tasty. They come with this pickled cabbage slaw and their version of salsa (I'm Mexican and used to the good stuff), together make these pupusas delicious. They also come with beans and rice, which were good too.  So I would recommend this place to anyone looking to try something new. Prices are reasonable and it's easy to find. I'll definitely be coming back.   Also if you check in with Yelp, you get a 10% discount on your bill."}
{"text":"Their pupusas are terrific!  Heck, multiple children even liked their kids menu a lot and you can't beat that.  Their chips are thick, fresh and as tasty as can be."}
{"text":"We had dinner at Salvadoreño Restaurant #2 and it was out of this world! I love this stuff!  Everything was served hot & fresh. The food is very delicious and focuses heavily on Yuca and starch, but in a good way! The meats are seasoned well, and the side dishes are out of this world! I'm not a fan of beans, but this was the exception!   Platanos Fritos con Crema y Frijoles - fried bananas with a cream sauce and a bean sauce - I don't know which I liked more!  Pastelitos de Carne o De Papas con Queso - Mean and cheese hot pockets of delicious flavor!  Yuca Frita o Cocida - Fried or Steamed Yuca that is so good dipped in the bean sauce!  Chicharron Pupusas - This pupusas need an award!  Tostadas de Platanos Verdes - Toasted plantain chips.. Outstanding!  Salvadoran Guacamole - This one was an odd duck. Sliced avocado w/ egg - interesting, but good!  Curtido & Salsa - The salsa is good, but the curtido is amazing!  Tamales de Pollo - Chicken Tamale that will rock your world!  Empanadas de Platano con Manjar Blanco  - This was a dessert empanada that had custard in it and banana. It was so good it made me want to slap my momma!   The above was about 40 bucks worth of food. Served 3 people WELL!"}
{"text":"I Love this place, I usually order Pupusas but I must admit the waiting time is the worst. They usually say 20-25 mins but never tell you to double that time. In reality it takes between 40-60 minutes (when they are slow). So my advice is don't trust the time you are given because most likely you will leave unhappy."}
{"text":"The 5 star rating is the for the pupusas and pupusas only... I didn't try anything else.  The pupusas were excellent. I was visiting from out of town, where you can't buy pupusas.  The service at the restaurant was adequate nothing to rave about.  I wish this restaurant was located close to where I live. I would patronage it at least once a week!"}
{"text":"I was in the mood for Salvadorian Food the closet to me was this place. I ordered the sampler being that it has a little bit of everything, I also ordered fresh water tamarindo and let me tell you it was super delicious at which I thought the food is going to be this good, after a long wait my food arrived and let me tell I was not impressed At all. It was a lot of Food, the popusas were so salty the yucca was dried the chicarones were salty as well.  I did not even dare to try the pastelitos or the other stuff I was done. The cabbage salad is my favorite well this one was warm,'did not taste good in fact it tasted as if it had been sitting there for a while. The positive thing was the  service it was descent for there only Being one waitress she was very nice. Too bad the food was not good. So I won't be back. Well maybe for a agua Fresca."}
{"text":"Worst customer service ever, walked in for dinner all the tables dirty, they didn't even greet us. The wait for the menu was long, the wait for our drinks was long and let me be exact the wait for the food was over half an hour. I was very disappointed with the horchata they served me, I took one zip and all I could taste was plastic. It took the waitress about 10-15 minutes for her to come back and check on us I asked if I could changed my drink and she said they would still charge me for it. I took one zip cup was full. The food came after a half hour. I noticed they grabbed the salsa and coleslaw from another table. Fml the bill was way too high I payed over $30 for food that took over a half hour and a drink I disliked. I would not return I never heard any manners or  thank you"}
{"text":"Very happy to have found this place - similar ingredients to Mexican food but refreshingly different flavors.   Went for dinner there last night for the first time. I ordered the beef stew but got the carne asada plate instead. I'm not complaining - it was awesome. Not the greatest cut of meat, but the flavor more than made up for it. The meat was cooked with green onions which gave it really nice onion-y flavor that was good but not overpowering. Boyfriend got the onion chicken, which had chicken breast sauteed with sweet or yellow onions and green peppers in sauce. Yum! I don't usually like green peppers, but these were really well cooked, soft and absorbed the taste of the onion sauce.   Most of the dinner plates come with black refried beans and either white rice or rice cooked with black beans.  Also comes with homemade corn tortillas that are awesome, probably could eat these things every day. Unlike typical tortillas that you get at Mexican places around here, these are really thick and actually taste like they're made from real corn (imagine that!).   Some things to know about this place - maps not quite accurate, if you're on 75th ave you won't see this place. Its actually on Thomas in the plaza with the Ross. Also, it helps if you speak a little bit of Spanish, our server new a bit of english so with that and lots of finger pointing we did ok.   Definitely coming back to this place!"}
{"text":"Este lugar es mi favorito para comprar popusas. Después de un día largo de trabajo es muy fácil llamar y hacer un pedido por teléfono y sólo pasar a recogerlas."}
{"text":"Great pupusa! Fresh made thick corn tortillas filled with a variety of goodies. My favorite is the spinach and the loroco, which is a vine blossom. Curtido which is a tangy coleslaw dish, no sweet dressing here! Entrees include tamales, steak cubes cooked in a tomato and onion sauce, beef tongue made the same way which is so tender and flavorful. The cheese filled pupusa are my wife's favorite, served with black beans and rice, or a slice of queso fresco makes a great meal. Must try this place."}
{"text":"They get 2 stars for the food. Service was horrible. Family of 6, two of the plates came out ten minutes before the rest. No utensils had to fetch our own. Automatic 15% tip for party's of 5 or more. The servers don't care it seems they know they will get the tip regardless of the service. The food is good but the service lacks luster."}
