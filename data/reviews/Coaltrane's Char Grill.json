{"text":"Extremely over priced, especially for the portion sizes.  Its chicken, which is as cheap as it gets.... Followed with a side of rice, again as cheap as it gets! And you can pick your last side, nothing special.  Service was terrible..... Waited forever, and they never came back to check on us. We had to go ask for our bill!  If you want good chicken, stick to the many bbq joints in charlotte."}
{"text":"I'm torn between the stars, so let's call it a 3.5. I like the food a lot. I really like that the menu is very different from most things in the area and healthy at that. What I don't like is the price for the portion. I got a full order of stuffed avocado add chicken. ($2 up-charge) This dish is 1 avocado cut in half and stuffed with quinoa and beans set on a small bed of arugula. While it's delicious, I paid over $10 for the meal, which was gone in about 6 bites total, including the arugula.   This spot has not been very kind to previous restaurants, and with a small portion/high priced menu, I am afraid Coaltranes will not last. It's a shame. Like I said, the food is good and offers a variety, which is super, but people want to feel like their meal is worth the price and not need a snack after the fact."}
{"text":"A few days ago, my husband and I traveled to Charlotte for a concert in the Time Warner Cable Arena.  We got to the area early so we walked across the street to the Epicentre for dinner.  We weren't quite sure which restaurant to choose, but we had never heard of Coaltrane's Char Grill so we decided to check out the reviews online.  Since it had good reviews, we went to the restaurant and were able to immediately get a seat.  In this spot, you seat yourselves.  You can either sit at the bar or at a table on the floor.  We chose a table on the floor and our waitress immediately came over with menus.  We only had to wait about five to ten minutes and our food arrived.  It was so good!  I loved the Pulled Chicken sandwich; the avocado was perfect with it.  Plus, the green beans were perfectly seasoned.  My husband had the Gaucho.  Even though he said it seemed like the sandwich needed a little more sauce, he loved the corn on the cob.  I really love the concept of this place.  The decor is cool and the menu options are grilled, but with a kick of flare.  The best part is it's pretty affordable.  The Pulled Chicken was only $8.95.  I would love to return next time I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Great fast casual spot.  Good food with a little Latin flair.  Very good service and what looks like it will be a nice outdoor bar / deck (once the weather warms up!). The rotisserie chicken, avocado and salads were great - and always great to combine w local craft beer options.  I'll definitely be a regular!"}
{"text":"Ordered delivery from Eat24 from here and food was disappointing. Sandwich was missing red peppers and skimpy on toppings. No sauces were included. Corn was as flavorless and soggy as described by another reviewer. Steak skewer had good flavor but really wanted sauce. Wings pretty dry too. Definitely will not order again."}
{"text":"First visit for lunch today. Greeted by friendly staff, ordered pulled chicken as platter not sandwich with green beans as side. It was delicious, those fresh green beans were perfection!!  Chicken was nice and moist sauce was great.  Loved the food a step above Viva Chicken."}
{"text":"Rotisserie chicken at it's finest. They offer 3 dipping sauces for the meal, all three of which are delicious with the chicken and rice. My favorite side is the green beans but the street corn is a very close second. I always add a stuffed avocado to the order just to top it off."}
{"text":"Chicken was cooked to perfection. Great flavors. Large half chicken portion. Mashed potatoes were awesome with perfect amount of garlic. Great service, friendly people, great food. Will be back soon!"}
{"text":"Amazing food. Very clear it is homemade and very flavorful. Owner was onsite and keeping things running smooth. Outstanding addition to Plaza Midwood."}
{"text":"The menu is simple, the food superb, the beer cold. I enjoy the steak sandwich, my wife loves the chicken, we both enjoy the tasty sides. Great place to have a meal before the Hornets game and not drop a bundle."}
{"text":"Yes yes yes!!! This place and the staff are absolutely amazing. Kayla the bartender was so sweet and Cheyenne one of the servers was also very sweet. The staff is informed about the dishes and the atmosphere and food is amazing. I ordered the I/4 chicken with garlic mash potatoes and stuffed avocado and it was scrumptious. Definitely would recommend all and any Charlotte natives to come to this restaurant and their music bingo( which is on Friday) and their trivia( which is on Thursday) if I could give them a 10 I would. Definitely satisfied and will be a long time customer"}
{"text":"My goodness.   I just DoorDashed this place for lunch and attracted a couple eyes at the office before I even dug in! I ordered a stuffed avocado, and which was an avocado split in half and topped with pinto beans, lettuce, a heaping pile of quinoa and queso fresca. It was sooooo good. I get the pleasure of feeling healthy and full at the same time...what a joy! I also got a side of corn casserole, which - no lie - I haven't had made the midwestern way since I've been in the south unless my Mom or Aunt was cooking it. It was PERFECT. Buttery, soft, and just the right amount of sweet. I'm excited to tell my love about it and plan a trip to dine in. The best part? The stuffed avocado was an appetizer; I was dining like a queen for $7.50!!! Couldn't get any better."}
{"text":"I had the stuffed avocado, and it was terrible. If you've had the chicken avocado from Viva Chicken don't try the one here, it doesn't compare. Also the night we went there was only one other table (large group) and the service was really bad too. We won't be going back."}
{"text":"The food looks and tastes amazing, and the atmosphere is always fun and energetic. This is definitely one of my go-to spots when I'm in town."}
{"text":"Great Bird with awesome sauces.  Best macaroni and cheese on the planet.  They make it to order! Friendliest peps work here, as well"}
{"text":"I'm afraid to to leave a great review and let the secret out about the cool, relaxed, rooftop bar at Coaltranes. But the food is too great not to share.   Been twice and the food was delicious both times. Quarter chicken is delicious and the mashed potatoes are some of the best I have ever had. The corn casserole is super tasty too.  Great, friendly service. Will certainly be back!"}
{"text":"Awesome. I work uptown and this is the best place for chicken. My fav is the avocado app add chicken. But when I allow myself to eat bread, i go with the chicken sandwich. Its juicy and tasty."}
{"text":"EDIT: I called about my missing dessert. I drove back there to retrieve it(no discount for my troubles) and wasn't even pleased with their version of a tres leche. Extremely disappointed   This is first time I've visited this place and it was awful! I ordered to go. My chicken was burnt and they forgot my dessert. I also got the quinoa and it was extremely salty to the point that it was inedible This is a new location so i guess they're just working out kinks but i suggest they work quickly."}
{"text":"I ordered a pickup for lunch. When I entered the manager and the other woman upfront greeted me by name and had everything ready with sauces, napkins, etc.  I've been to a lot of places for pickup and the majority of the time I have to wait and I'm never greeted by name.  I've tried some of the food already and everything has been good so far. I tried the avocado (haven't had Vivas) but this was excellent and had a perfect balance of seasoning.  I spent $20 (got the whole chicken) and the experience and food have better than places you spend $75 for dinner at."}
{"text":"I don't write bad reviews unless I am extremely disappointed. I was. If you're going for the food don't bother. I asked them to give me whatever they recommend and I got this ridiculous bowl of some greens and awful pieces of steak. These guys won't stay in business long. Place is clean though and the staff ... Oh well  worst spent $15"}
{"text":"I had the steak salad . The steak was very well seasoned and it reminded me of when my parents used to do family cookouts . I also had a raspberry ? Lemonade and that was delicious ! Concept is casual , go to the front and order you food and take the number back to the table . I didn't know where to leave my dirty dishes so I left them on the table ."}
{"text":"The place is a bit divey but the food is AMAZING. I got the pulled chicken sandwich and loved it. Lots of sauces and flavor. Very unique.  If you are looking for good food and are a sauce person, come to Coaltrains."}
{"text":"Delicious rotisserie chicken, better than Viva Chicken.  Even the sides were flavorful. The restaurant was very clean and simple perfect for a quick lunch. Best lunch I've had in a while. I'll be back very soon."}
{"text":"Oh and get the char grilled platter with flat iron steak- bomb! Also there's a manager by the name of Audrey I think. She is the Bee's knees :-)"}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick meal. Was a little confused about how to order or if we should seat ourselves. Menu was limited but just enough to get the job done. We ended up seating ourselves at the bar and kind of hanging out before flagging someone down to take our order.The restaurant focuses on rotisserie chicken. Has salads/sandwiches/whole chicken. Tried the 1/4 chicken with grilled corn. Food was quick to come out. Chicken and corn were tasty."}
{"text":"Ate here during the soft-opening. If it wasn't the soft opening, it would have been 3 stars.  They had messed up my salad order and didn't bring the food out at the same time, and then just couldn't get the dressing down right so I just ate the salad as was.  Decent flavors.   Unimpressed with the stuffed avocado and the boy didn't love the quinoa too much.  Definitely going to try the wings next time, those looked dynamite.  Saying there is a \"patio\" space is a bit of a stretch. There's about 2 seats, maybe 3 at the bar, and a couple of tables so not exactly the spot where you'd go grab a cold one on a patio somewhere when the weather is nice."}
{"text":"Came in randomly with my nephew walking through the epicentre.  We both loved the food.  I had rotisserie with street corn.  Excellent.  He had pulled chicken on ciabatta an loved it.  Seems all the places in this location close down.......but hope this place stays around."}
{"text":"Went here for some drinks on the patio on a Thursday night. Had great service from the bartender, Kayla. She was super personable and just the right amount of talkative. I got the stuffed avocado with chicken added. It was delicious and a great amount of food. Just what I needed for my night out on the town. Will definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"Food was great and Audrey is awesome!! We will definitely be back and make sure to check out music bingo on Friday!"}
{"text":"Really good service. Clean and trendy environment. Awesome location and there's actually parking right next to it which is rare for this area. I really wanted to like this restaurant but the food was somewhat boring. The chicken wasn't dry or anything but it wasn't enough to be my favorite meal. I'll give it another try"}
{"text":"Quality control has gotten a lot better lately. The last few orders I picked up they've double check to make sure that all the sauces, sides, and everything that I ordered was there. The food is flat out delicious... Just a matter of getting it correctly in your order. But they've listened to their customers, stepped up their game, and you should definitely check them out for some delicious chicken and sides (and the sauces!)"}
{"text":"Update 3-26-18 So maybe my headline was a little harsh, but I was extremely upset and extremely disappointed and Frankly, I just tell it the way it is. I have since received a defensive message from the server, (which I thought was a little tacky), but at least I know they're reading the reviews. I only hope they can take customers reviews into consideration to help improve their business. Maybe instead of taking offense of my review, both the server and the owner could've asked the question, what can we do to make our customers experience more enjoyable? Sometimes a little constructive criticism from the people who actually spend money at your establishment is the best feedback of all. You have created an incredible atmosphere and a wonderful space. With just a few minor improvements, your establishment could be five stars, and be packed every night with happy customers.   Voted the absolute worst chicken wings in Charlotte!!!! HUGE disappointment!  For a restaurant that specializes in chicken, you think the food would be delicious. The wings are the tiniest chicken wings I ever had, with absolutely no sauce, and they only served six tiny little wings and two pieces of carrots for nine dollars. I have a 100% success rate of calling out businesses that are going to fail, and unfortunately this is going to be one of them. Even the service was bad. I ordered three extra blue cheese and when my order came there was 1 ranch on the plate?? No napkins on the table ( all of the bins were not refilled, on any table) and the upstairs bar tender was to busy texting on her phone instead of helping us...  I am going to anonymously give them another shot. If my second experience is better than my first, I will update my review and delete the old one and let everybody know the outcome."}
{"text":"We were 9 diners and everything was delicious. Amazing service. Stuffed avocado, chorizo sandwich, soup, corn, and salads, flat iron steak. Save room for the Dulce la Leche crepe!!!"}
{"text":"Personal, beautiful, new! Love the upstairs bar! They have remodeled and while I can't comment on the food it's a great place to hang out"}
{"text":"Honestly wasn't expecting much. Stuffed avocado was really good, it's a meal on its own. The wings are some of the best wings/sauce I've had in Charlotte, better or comparable with most of the best wing/bbq joints.   The steak entree/ sandwich was also very good. I was expecting a knock off of Viva chicken but it's different and tasty."}
{"text":"Yum! Came here and grabbed a few dishes- stuffed avocado, which is larger and more plentiful than some other rotisserie places in CLT, soup, and of course the chicken. They've got a pretty laid back vibe but have definitely jazzed the place up from the old breakfast spot it used to be (RIP Country Kitchen). Prices are fair and it's never too crowded. Definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"Amazing! Loved the food.. loved the environment. Audrey is amazing! Can't wait to come back for music bingo night."}
{"text":"This place is awesome!!!! Really really good food with a lot to choose from so many people can be happy and you can go back a lot and try new things.   I had the char grilled quest fresco bowl- amazing! Really good sauces to go with it too. Fiancé had the chargrilled steak plate and is still talking about it.   To top it all off the vibe is amazing and the service was incredible. The owners were so sweet and walking around talking to folks.   We didn't go to the rooftop bar because it was cold but I will definitely be enjoying that this spring summer.   Highly recommend. If you've just walked by before - like we did for months- go in!!! Support a local business and enjoy"}
{"text":"I have been here a few times now and have tried 2 things. The stuffed avocado with shredded chicken is AMAZING!! All of the ingredients make for an awesome lunch, if you don't want to indulge on too much. The waitress recommended the pulled chicken sandwich so on my 2nd visit I got that with the delicious corn on the cob.   Great for a casual dinner or lunch. Service is decent and a convenient location if you're hanging out uptown."}
{"text":"Note: this is a casual dining experience. There are no waiters and waitresses. It's just like Viva Chicken or Panera except with beer and wine and some other spirits.   The FOOD is GREAT! Perfect for to-go orders. I hope thy continued to build out that option (there appears to be a walk up window). Tons of healthy options - no seafood option: - chicken, steak and veggie only. I ordered the wings and the Rice Bowl - the Fresca Queso cheese is a shaved fresh queso not a sauce (like at a Mexican restaurant). My friend ordered a salad and it looked amazing. I will Def be here in the summer on the deck ordering a salad.  If you choose to dine-in, the atmosphere is casual and relaxed. Good for kids, groups of friends that want to eat and chill. There is a small rooftop deck (on the backside) with a small bar. Cute and cozy. Will surly be packed in the summer cause drink prices are reasonable."}
{"text":"I stop to see what was this place was about , really disappointed , we have a party of 6 wanted to try something different but when I saw the menu was like a copy of Viva chicken , we order the chicken with green beans,chicken was overcooked green beans from a can , I work in the business so I know when something is from a can, the rest of the party order the chicken sandwich , chicken was cold and hard  , for sure we are won't be back"}
{"text":"I can't even begin to explain how great this little spot in Central is!! The food is so good and so fresh. The inside has a loft area and a cute small outdoor patio. Even the staff was incredible and had great energy. (Shout out to Frank and Shyanne!!)   This is such a good spot. Viva chicken who??"}
{"text":"I had high hopes for this new spot since it's in my neighborhood but unfortunately I wasn't very impressed. The menu is almost the same as Viva Chicken or even the other new place Roasting Co. Due to the location of Coaltrane I was hoping they would try to tap into the nightlife in Plaza Midwood.   We walked in and were warmly welcomed by either the manager or owner. She informed us there were some specials and that their was a bar upstairs. We placed our order and the gentleman taking it didn't seem to know the menu or how to ring it in. Now I know they are new but your staff needs to be trained before interacting with guests. I told the guy 3 times that I didn't want beans on my stuffed avocado. I also had asked if there were any other type of bean, other than pinto, that could be subbed out and the manager said she is working on getting black beans. After placing our order we went upstairs to check out the bar. This bar is more like a small server station and it's outside. I am so disappointed with the set up of this place because it had so much potential. They have signs up for NYE at Coaltrane and it seems like they want nightlife but you can't count on that with a tiny little outside bar.   Now we decided to sit inside since the temperature was in the 30's. The food was delivered to us and the waitress was very friendly. I cut into mine and there were beans, lots of beans. Now the stuffed avocado was good minus the dang beans. Then I ordered the street corn casserole, I'll warn you now it's not street corn... it's cornbread. The favor was good if you wanted cornbread but it didn't taste anything like street corn. My date got the quart dark chicken and he said it was ok but that he prefers the other two chicken spots over this one.   I think they are trying to tap into a market that is already a bit monopolized. I am just so disappointed to not see this as a nice place to grab a cocktail. I would give them a second try but I don't think this will be a regular spot for me. Best of luck Coaltrane!"}
{"text":"My gf and I live in the neighborhood and decided to drop in after seeing a review on the stuffed avocados. And I must say,  what a great decision! This is a cool, quick service spot with healthy,  yet tasty food.  Order your food at the counter, take a number and your food will be brought to your table when done.  Full bar upstairs with a nice patio so I definetly can't wait until the weather truly breaks.  They have some really good specials during the week like 75 cents wings and $4 Wine. The rotisserie chicken, pinto, brown rice with quinoa, stuffed avocados and street corn custard was amazing.  Oh and the drinks were pretty good too. The staff was attentive and genuinely seemed interested in making sure we had a great dining experience. We'll definetly be back!"}
{"text":"This place is a fantastic choice for wholesome, healthy and flavorful food, great beer and offers an awesome location! My husband loves meat and I'm a vegetarian and we're both VERY satisfied here-- and their staff is quirky and always a good time. Especially Audrey, she is a hoot and we enjoyed her excellent service! Please come check this place out!"}
{"text":"We've gone back several times since and have had much better experiences! The food has been very consistent and delicious - whether a grain bowl or a 1/4 chicken with 2 sides.   The service has also been much improved! Everyone has been very kind and accommodating. For example, when a friend's piece of chicken on one trip was much smaller than everyone else's, the manager (a very nice woman), cheerfully brought him up a second piece for him.   There is also fun music bingo on Friday night and $3 drafts - great special for a Friday! We will continue to keep this place in our rotation, thanks to great food and even better people!"}
{"text":"This is our first visit. But it won't be our last! Frisco bowl is fantastic. The flank steak with 2 sides was an ample serving. It would have been nearly perfect had the steak not been over cooked. I asked for rare and it was well done. Flank steak is thinly sliced so it's easy to overlook it which it makes it tough. The flavor however, was excellent."}
{"text":"Stopped in to Coaltrane's for a Wednesday night dinner around 7 p.m.  You order from the counter - the ladies working were very helpful in explaining the menu and the various sauce options.    We went with 2 salads and added chicken to both.  I got a side of the salsa verde (mint and jalapeno - not spicy, very yum!) and my husband got a side of all three hot sauces (he said they weren't overly hot, but they were tasty).  The chicken was good and the salads fresh and crisp.  They were delivered to our table very quickly.    We had our pick of tables...because we were literally the only customers in the restaurant.  We opted to sit upstairs on the outdoor patio - it was a nice feel, but a bit lonely.  We were told this place gets quite busy on music trivia nights...  Overall, the food and service were great.  This will be a repeat for a quick, casual dinner."}
{"text":"Went here after my graduation and wow! Was it perfect. They allowed us to take up the space upstairs for my semi large party and our waiter/ bartender Aubrey was so helpful and perfect! I would recommend this place to anyone who asks!   Sweet corn and the mashed potatoes were so delicious!"}
{"text":"Me and my daughters had a wonderful time there few weeks ago. Great atmosphere, very pleasant service all around, attentive cashier/server named Ruby. Delicious food with affordable and reasonable prices. Even though the place is about chicken-chicken-chicken, the menu in whole seems very health conscious and with many options for vegetarians such as myself.We loved it and definitely coming back!!!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch, a little concerned that I was the only patron at the time. You order at the counter, and then they bring it out. I had the pulled chicken sandwich with a side of street corn casserole.   Unfortunately my side dish came out cold, so I had to go back to the counter and ask for them to warm it up. My sandwich was ok, seemed like the chicken was in a small pile on one side of the sandwich.  Food was ok, but not inspiring in any way."}
{"text":"I had picked up pizza at another epi-center spot (delicious & well priced) & decided to try the \"grilled street corn on the cob\".  BIG MISTAKE!!   First off the employees were sullen & not one smiled (there were 4), the female cook/grill chic shot me angry eyes even. Second, don't be fooled by the word \"grilled\" in the menu description. The \"cob\" was plucked from a container of water where, by the non-corn taste of it, it had been for quite some time & placed on the grill for less than a minute. What's confusing is, on a cart right near the grill was a container of unshucked fresh corn!!!! Third, do not believe the words \"corn on the cob\", rather think COBBETTE aka half a corn on the cob & a spindly little one at that!! I've included a photo of the sad, underweight little cobbette with a standard cigarette lighter as a scale guide. Fourth, the sad, spindly, flavorless cobbETTE was $3.00. There was no slathering of mayonnaise, no shower of yummy queso fresco, no sprinkle of cayenne pepper or paprika.  Just a soggy, spindly, sad little cobbette. Look elsewhere for street corn."}
{"text":"Always amazing food for a great price.  The chicken dinner with greens beans and corn is the best I've had.  Beats out all other highly rated chicken I've tried in the area."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a drink on the rooftop bar and Alex and the young lady who was there was so friendly, nice and helpful. I recommend any time but especially when you just want to chill"}
{"text":"Dined in and ordered out at least 4x now since the opening. Lots of flavor on the menu and something for everyone especially for both our kids under 3. Love the renovation of the space; fits the neighborhood and the outdoor area and bar will be a great additional spot to go once the weather gets warmer. It's not like Viva Chicken since you have more meats, sides and most importantly, booze. My favorite is the sweet corn casserole!"}
{"text":"I had an amazing sunday lunch! This place rocks and the service is top notch. The girl in the kitchen has such a peaceful look to her. Good vibes !"}
{"text":"Not worth the money. We were in their yesterday and based on the good reviews we tried it out. I should have taken a picture of my steak sandwich. There was hardly any meat. I could have gotten more at Dominoes for half the price. It was mostly just bread, tomatoes and onions.   My wife got a quarter chicken which was about the size of a quarter lol.  Seeing as this place has only been open for 2 weeks you would think they would be serving it better. We won't be back.  Oh and btw, the terrace bar upstairs which supposedly had views of the city I guess meant views of Plaza Midwood since I couldn't see uptown at all."}
{"text":"They offer stuffed avocados that are delicious!!! Thank youuu for a great tasty healthy option. I think it's awesome you can do a half order of it, either for a good sized lunch or you just want to save room to try their other tasty options. All of the sauces are delicious,  I love flavor so I mixed them together differently for each bite and honestly offered me a fun way to eat as well. I especially love their 2 most hottest hot sauce though.    The corn casserole was not what i expected to be which was street corn style but i appreciate their unique twist & my 10 month babyboy sure liked it. The mash potatoes are delicious!!!!!! The steak cooked & flavored so tasty & wonderfully as well.   Been in Clt my whole life & never came to what it was before.  I don't know if I should be ashamed or that's common.  I noticed there was something here but for no reason at all I just never experienced it. I sure don't regret giving this a try though & I'm glad Coaltrane is here now. Most likely would frequent this place on the regular now. Everyone is so friendly!"}
{"text":"My colleague and I went here for lunch yesterday.It was my first time,but not hers.I definitely have been missing out though!I can't remember the exact name of my sandwich but it was a sandwich with steak on ciabatta (chicken is an option too).It was so good!I loved the pesto spread they used and the veggies (mushrooms,peppers,etc) added a nice crunch to the sandwich. I ordered a salad as my side which was fresh.I am a big fan of my lettuce cut thin so I was pleased with the cutting of the lettuce.My colleague ordered some type of bowl and was pleased with her meal as well.  We went about 11:30am and it did not take long at all for our food to be served.I noticed a lot of pick up orders,so this seems to be a regular place for many individuals.  I observed parking and traffic can be congested as it is located in Plaza Midwood."}
{"text":"Not a good value compared to other rotisserie chicken places in the area... sides are just okay.  I will not be back."}
{"text":"The wings were absolutely delicious, especially the barbecue ones. Also, go for the stuffed avocados.   Drinks were awesome and service impeccable.  I'd recommend this place to anyone looking for delicious food and cool atmosphere."}
{"text":"friendly staff, delicious food!! gotta try. glad it's in the neighborhood. nothing on the menu that i do not like."}
{"text":"I only do reviews when a place really impressed me and Coaltrane's meets that criteria.  Very flavorful and diverse menu, a few good beer choices, and a little rooftop bar with a great skyline view of CLT.  Food is real quick for those late work nights when I just want a beer and a bite without cooking.  The chicken bowls are my go to but Gaucho sando is on point as well."}
{"text":"Viva Chicken has a cousin from the southern United States and her name is Coaltrane. Neat setup with seating and a full bar upstairs make this Plaza Midwood fast-casual spot a crowd pleaser.   Dinner on a Saturday night after an afternoon visit to Codescape and sunset drinks at Thirsty Rabbit; I was surprised that it wasn't that busy, but guess they are still developing a customer base.   Good price point and the fact that there are on-tap beers and other drinks available will make this place work well in the neighborhood. The stuffed avocado dish was good and the sides of mac and cheese and quinoa with vegetables was just right. Very surprised that my friends could also order the avocado as they had \"run out of it and were on their way to get more.\" They'll work out any little issues like this and hit their stride soon enough.   I don't live nearby, so would go out of my way to eat here, but a solid option affordable option while neighborhood."}
{"text":"Visiting from out of town when we came upon this place. Not sure why there are not more reviews on Yelp. Pulled chicken sandwich and gaucho sa which were awesome. So flavorful. We had the corn on the cob as a side and I fell in love with it. You have to try the stuffed avocado. I just fell in love with.  Please give this place a try. Staff was very courtesy and super friendly"}
{"text":"I hadn't been itching to try this place because we've already got RoCo and Viva Chicken rocking the rotisserie close by. I'm really glad the group I was with came here. I had the pulled chicken fresco bowl and it was much better than I expected. The pickled onions, arugula, and house sauces made this meal stand out. I'm a creature of habit and tend to frequent the same places. It looks like Coaltrane's will be added to the rotation! Oh, and they have $3 drafts on Fridays which doesn't hurt!"}
{"text":"Great location with an awesome upstairs patio. Friendly staff and delicious beer on tap. Music Bingo on Friday 8:30-10:30p is the icing on the cake!"}
{"text":"This place is usually very good and not terribly slow, even when busy, but the last two times my fiance and I have ordered from here it has been very slow and the service has been poor.  I attempted to order on Postmates, and I guess I started my order before they flipped the \"too busy\" switch so was a little confused when I wasn't able to complete the order.  Instead, we called in a pick up order and were told the wings would be 30 minutes, which would be alright but I'd rather not wait, so canceled that part of the order.  I wish I wouldn't have, though because the order we went with took longer than that anyway and was of much lower quality than past orders.  Even with the difficult parking we still had to wait a long time once inside for food.  Instead of an apology they just said \"OMG we're busy\" even though it didn't appear to be the case.  This place is usually good but there is way too much good food in Charlotte to deal with that sort of disorganization."}
{"text":"1-night stop at Charlotte and the concierge recommended Epicentre to find a quick kid-friendly dinner. We saw this place empty but the menu was enticing. So glad we didn't skip it. Their stuffed avocado was amazing with their jalapeño mint sauce added on top. My kid loved the Choripan, my husband's churrasco was very good and we loved the corn casserole. Definitely a hidden gem. The staff was very friendly and welcoming. Will repeat the next time we are in town!!"}
{"text":"I got the 1/4 chicken which was very good.  They give you a couple of sauces.  It comes with brown rice plus your choice of one side.  I got the green beans with almonds - a little bland but not too bad.    This restaurant reminds me of Viva Chicken although there are more side options at Viva Chicken and you get a choice of two sides.  I do like Coaltrane's better than the last restaurant that was there.  I'd visit again."}
{"text":"Felt like mixing it up a bit from my go-to, Viva Chicken. Coaltranes was a good alternative. I appreciate the variety in the menu.   We ended up going with the stuffed avocados and pulled chicken sandwich. I prefer Coaltranes stuffed avocados to Viva, but I would give Viva the edge with the sandwiches.   The bartender taking my takeout order was a bit loopy and took a while to place a simple order, but I'll write that off as a one-time thing.   I will be back; good takeout place since I can only tolerate the Epicentre in short durations."}
{"text":"I found this spot roaming around the Epicentre for lunch during the workweek. I wanted to try something different and switch it up. The first thing I noticed was the decor. It's cozy with a lot of woods and somewhat of an industrial feel to it. I was not sure what type of food it was until I looked at the menu. With the featured rotisserie chicken and some of the sides, I recognized it to be Peruvian cuisine.  I ordered a quarter chicken with two sides while my coworker got a chicken sandwich. The sides were a bit on the smaller side but overall the food was tasty. I personally like Viva Chicken better but Coaltrane's is a nice, unique option to have in uptown...especially for the very touristy, corporate-heavy Epicentre.  I'm looking forward to checking out their second, new location in Plaza Midwood. I got a peek while it's finishing construction and it looks beautiful inside."}
{"text":"Their upstairs bar is an awesome little Midwood hideaway. Delicious chicken wings and fresco bowls. Don't sleep on their sides either. Mashed potatoes with gravy and corn casserole are perfection."}
{"text":"Coaltrane's is a new spot in the Epicenter that is a must try. Although the atmosphere is rather mild, the food is on point. Pictured is their chicken salad sandwich - a scrumptious compilation of celery, grapes, walnuts, and chopped herbs, served on organic sprouted multigrain bread. They also have tons of other great dishes to choose from, including quinoa stuffed avocado (ask to add pulled chicken), which is full of flavor and graciously proportioned. I will forever miss the Greek place that was here but I am pleased with its replacement."}
{"text":"First time here. Great service (thanks Brittany). The Frisco Bowl was delish and the flank steak had great flavor. Would have  given it 5 stars had the steak not been over cooked, making it a little dry and tough. I'd ordered it rare. Too hungry to send back but I know they would have replaced it had I asked. Good sized portions too! Prices reasonable. Do check it out!"}
{"text":"I placed a takeout order tonight and when I returned discovered that the order was not what I placed. I attempted to call the restaurant twice; no one answered, nor was there voicemail (there was no one in the restaurant when we picked up the order so I do not think it was too busy to answer the phone). I attempted to send an email to the address listed on the website (eat@coaltraneschargrill.com) and my email bounced back. I tried to fill out the comment section on the website and immediately was met with a message stating \"Failed to send your message.\" Wondering why I would ever return to a restaurant that does not appear to want business (how can someone call to place a takeout order when no one answers?), gives incorrect orders to patrons and has no way to contact anyone."}
{"text":"The roasted chicken was great but their sides are mediocre and the selection of sides isn't that great. Additionally they weren't hot when they were served to us."}
{"text":"The Plaza Midwood neighborhood in Charlotte welcomed it's newest eatery and added another awesome dining experience to an already impressive resume.  We had an opportunity to preview the Coaltrane's Char Grill which opened it's second location in the Queen City at 1518 Central Avenue in a recently renovated early 20th-Century brick building that once housed John's Country Kitchen.  Coaltrane's founders Mike Libretto and Mario Flynn went above and beyond to bring this location to life, including adding a second floor dining experience for some intimacy and a tree house deck for sipping suds under the stars with a spectacular view of uptown.  With a menu that has a little bit of everything (as long as it isn't fried or unhealthy), even the most the discriminating foodies on a budget will feel right at home.  From rotisserie chicken, flatiron steak sandwiches, quinoa w/ roasted vegetables, stuffed avocados, and a supremely delicious desert menu that includes Tres Leches, Coaltrane's has their bases covered.  For our craft beer aficionado's, Coaltrane's has you covered too.  Their rotating tap has some great local craft beers and several from outside the area as well.  They also have a decent wine and spirit selection if you lean that way.  Fantastic family-friendly restaurant in a gorgeous building run by an amazing staff.  Who could ask for anything more?"}
{"text":"Went to Coaltrane's at 7pm when it wasn't busy at all, our party of 4 was the only group in the restaurant. I ordered the Pepino salad, asked for no tomatoes, and the other 3 in my party got 1/4 chicken and two sides. My salad came with no feta, no arugula and no salad dressing (which it was supposed to have on it).  It did however come with the tomatoes I asked them to leave off. It was basically $10 for romaine, onion, tomatoes and chicken and in a puddle of water. One of the sides with the 1/4 chicken was incorrect and the guy that brought it out seemed frustrated and short with us when we explained what it was supposed to be. I had to ask twice for the dressing for my salad. The food overall was pretty underwhelming. Perhaps they need more Time to work the kinks out but they should definitely think about hiring nicer staff."}
{"text":"The food is amazing, it is my favorite roasted chicken so far. The sides was delicious too."}
{"text":"So I been wanting to try this place for some time I went there today and to be honest I'm on the fence about coming back I ordered the stuff avocado and street corn casserole the food was pretty tasty a lil bland for me but tasty my issue with this place was the lack luster customer service and the fact that I had a 40min wait for something I ordered to go I was very annoyed but here's the kicker I ordered a drink when I went to refill it before I left there was mosquito in my cup not sure how it got there or when but I noticed it half way through my drink I ask for the manager one of the team members takes my drink to the manager and I honestly didn't feel any since of urgency or remorse all I got was a new cup and a $5 off my next trip no refund no free dessert no apology nobody stopped to check the ice machine or anything that didn't sit well with me"}
{"text":"Ordered the chicken soup and 1/2 a rotisserie chicken. My soup came out cold, flavor was alright but nothing too special. I hope you like rice because there was a ton of it in the soup. The rotisserie chicken was good but the rice that came with it was bland and tasteless."}
{"text":"Amazing chicken wings!  I have literally searched for wings this good since I moved to Charlotte. Much better than the alternative up the road.  Try this place out!"}
{"text":"Coaltrane's is a great new addition to Plaza. Very, very similar to Viva Chicken with a few differences on their menu. My only recommendation for ownership is to cut back on the amount of salt and speed up the service. I waited about 25 minutes for my meal. Try the char-grilled steak - good stuff!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! Great, friendly service and fantastic food! Glad I found this when visiting the Charlotte area!"}
{"text":"We loved everything we tried here.. the gaucho sandwich, rotisserie chicken, stuffed avocado, and corn casserole. Great rooftop patio and additional upstairs seating. Good tunes. Have to put this chicken over RoCo and Viva, because I loved the charred skin.   Great service, too. We were given a complementary milk for my son, and when my toddler kicked his shoe off the balcony (where we couldn't see it) they gladly hopped off to see if it had fallen underneath the deck."}
{"text":"Amazing staff. Fun environment and amazing food. love the rooftop bar! Better then Viva and anything in plaza ! Staff was very friendly"}
{"text":"Friday's is $3 drafts and music bingo! Awesome space on the rooftop bar area.   Food was great. I got 3 sides- half an avocado , street corn casserole and quinoa with roasted vegetables.  Hubby got the char grilled steak plate with 2 sides! Sauces are on point!   Reminds me of Viva Chicken if you've ever been but a bit more expensive.   Love the area and the specials each day. Service was on point"}
{"text":"We wanted a somewhat healthy option for lunch so decided to give Coaltrane's a try. We were greeted by the friendly face at the register in the rear of the restaurant. The place has a cozy feel downstairs but also has an upstairs area with a full bar. The food options are similar to Viva Chicken and Roco. I had the quarter white chicken option. The chicken was just ok. But with the sauce it was good. I asked for mash potatoes but was told they had none. So I got Street corn casserole and stuffed avocado..which was pretty good. The wife had wings. She had to get them to go because was told after 10 minutes of waiting for our food that it'd take 20 minutes for wings. We may try Coaltrane's again one day. Maybe. With so many other good options in the area now, they need to step it up if they wanna survive."}
{"text":"I should have reviewed this a while ago.  We came here for lunch and, well, it was totally good.  Not great, but good.  First and foremost, given the location, it was open and spacious.  There was seating.  The seating was clean.  I didn't feel crowded at any point.    The ordering process was kind of annoying.  You have to get up to the front of the line AT THE REGISTER in order to get a menu due to the menu placement, so you're at the register holding people up before you've even seen a menu and now you're looking and deciding.  The options aren't that straightforward because several of them look similar to each other and it's difficult to understand the differences.  Plus, if you want a drink, she has to fill it for you.  Makes getting the right amount of ice kind of difficult and refills even worse!  I ended up getting at salad and the half-avocado starter.  BUT, although I ordered just one half avocado, she rang me up for the whole avocado.  Although I ordered no meat, she gave me chicken.  *sigh*  More food and more expensive than I wanted but after she misheard me twice, I kind of gave up.  Also, I should have ordered less sauce or sauce on the side because the amount of sauce was overwhelming and I'm not a smother-my-food-in-sauce kind of person; I like to taste my ingredients, actually.  The salad was good, decent sized and fresh.  I ordered everything on the side and it did come that way, but a couple of ingredients were combined into the same cup (cheese and nuts) which meant that I couldn't put just some of each, I had to dump all of the thing on top to get any of the thing on bottom.  Kind of defeats the purpose, no?  Plus only the dressing (two cups' worth) came with covers, nothing else did.  So two cups of dressing but only half a cup of toppings?  Really??? And by cup, I mean those little 2 oz cups, not an actual 8 oz cup, just to be clear.  You have to get your own silverware and by silverware I mean plasticware and they don't even match!!!  Knives are small white plastic, forks and spoons thick, heavy black plastic.  What?   But the food arrived quickly and our plates were cleared in decent intervals and I was given a to-go box when requested (although no additional lids for my salad toppings...).  So it was overall a win for an eat-in option in city-center at lunch."}
{"text":"Love the upstairs patio! Bartender up there was very friendly and making sure every table had was they wanted. First time, so didn't know if they brought your food to you if you're upstairs (they do!) plus you can order up there with the bartender and they'll call it down. Food was amazing and great drink specials!"}
{"text":"Plaza Midwood's new kid on the block is delicious! I stopped in the day after they opened in the middle of the afternoon. They weren't crowded so service was super attentive and quick. Everyone was ready to explain the menu, offer suggestions on what to order, ask if I needed anything at all, etc.   The interior is gorgeous. If you ever frequented the previous tenant, John's Country Kitchen, you won't believe this is the same space. They've somehow added an open loft space, beautiful exposed bricks,  and dark wood paneling to a spot that was pretty old and well, well worn. It is literally a brand new place.   I had the stuffed avocado with pulled chicken and a side of green beans. While the avocados were good (more about them in a minute) the green beans were the star, hands down! They are crunchy and garlicky. Sooooo tasty! I could eat them by the bucket full. The avocados were also good. The avocados themselves were perfectly ripe and soft. (I hate it when you get an avocado that's still kinda hard because it's not ready yet.) They are stuffed with quinoa, pinto beans, and queso fresco and topped with a red, creamy sauce. They didn't have quite the kick I was looking for, so I went back to the counter for their salsa verde. That did the trick!  My only piece of feedback/room for improvement... I wish they had the sauces out for self service like the other Peruvian chicken place in town that I shall leave unnamed. I would have liked a little bit more salsa verde (it's killer!!) for my avocados but didn't want to look like a total fat kid by asking for more after I already downed one container's worth."}
{"text":"As a Plaza Midwood Resident for the past couple of years, I have been wanting a chicken rotisserie within walking distance. My prayers were answered when Coaltrane's was introduced to our neighborhood.   The place is similar to Viva Chicken, but there is more diversity (the wings are a great addition to the menu!). I also think their sauces are more unique and flavorful.   My favorite items on the menu are the chargrilled wings and the fresco bowl. All ingredients of the items I've had from the menu are incredibly fresh.   Definitely a Plaza Midwood favorite of mine. Please show them some love; you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"Argentenian style grill (sort of like Viva Chicken).  Several different options on the menu.  You can go baked chicken, Flank Steak or Chorizo.  My personal favorite was the steak.  It was very tinder and juicy, with a nice flavor.  Perfect in salad form or with rice and beans.  As an alternative or starter, the stuffed Avocado was really good.  Add the pulled chicken and it makes for a nice light lunch."}
{"text":"Awesome Chicken and awesome service. I would highly recommend if you are looking for something tasty and healthy but don't feel like cooking. Super cool atmosphere inside the building and the employees are super nice, friendly and helpful. We added this into our rotation for local restaurants to grab food from- highly recommend stopping by for the rotisserie chicken and corn casserole!"}
{"text":"Not nearly as good as Viva Chicken, but similar concept and very convenient location for those that work or live in Uptown. It's located in Epicentre and is probably one of the better heathy options for food there. I had the 1/4 chicken with a side of green beans and rice and it was good but not anything exciting. They also have similar sauces to Viva but not quite as good."}
{"text":"Yesterday I tried this place out for the first time for lunch as it is close to my job and what can I say but the food was AMAZING!!! Well at least the Buffalo wings, stuffed avocado and \"street\" corn known to us a \"grandma\" corn. We also had the black beans that had great flavor but was a little more on the al dente side then I would like (the young lady who was working was really nice and got us some more). The chipotle maple wings remind me of a spicy sweet sauce (very spicy) in my opinion but I also think Siracha is super HOT so it just depends. You could definitely taste the maple but I was okay with that, although I preferred the Buffalo. If you want saucy wings ask for extra sauce but if you get the Buffalo you probably won't need it because the flavoring is amazing. Oh, I also had the goddess salad and the fresh farmer, we went for lunch and dinner in the same day. . Will definitely be back to try more of the menu, it's small but I prefer small menus as to not over whelm me. Definitely give this place a try, I'm sure you'll be back. 4.5"}
{"text":"Heard about this place, it's another one that I'll never go to because of location so today I selected it for lunch and had Postmates bring to my office.    This place is boom-bam-tastic!  I ordered the Pepino Salad with chicken and the steak skewers.  Both were on point.  I usually don't eat cow, but I was curious how they'd do their cow so is why I got the skewers... SO glad I did!  The Pepino salad was also delicious.  So fresh, crisp and full of veggies.  When I say full of veggies I mean like, I was hunting for more lettuce with my fork half way through.  The chicken was so moist and tender and the herb dressing was also seasoned well.  I had eaten all of the steak before I even thought about taking a picture of it, but I did manage to stop myself from eating long enough to take one of the Pepino salad for you to see.    This was a complete win for me and I'll absolutely order from Coaltranes again soon!"}
{"text":"Was in Charlotte for a week and had to eat here twice because it was so good. Both times I ordered the 1/4 chicken, half stuffed avocado. The first time I got potatoes as well and the second a side salad. Everything was amazing and the staff was incredibly friendly, attentive, and an example of what great service should be. The food was fresh and had so much flavor. The price is really good too. Wish this was back home!"}
{"text":"Walked in thinking it was going to just be fast food but i was pleasantly surprised. Mine and my girlfriends food was amazing, service was great and friendly and there is also a tv to watch some sports. Wonderful place, will eat again no doubt."}
{"text":"Phone number listed for the location on Central is incorrect - it is for the uptown location - and apparently this location does not offer quinoa or roasted potatoes AND 2 sides as the website states."}
{"text":"I thought it might be named after john Coltrane, and that it was gonna be a snooty jazz joint. But when I walked in they were playing \"Smooth\" by Santana (featuring Rob Thomas) and I was like, 'hell yeah' this is my new bar!"}
{"text":"I felt full in a healthy way :) great management. Clean. Comfortable. We had a nice time!!"}
{"text":"A friend recommended I come here and I must say i was not disappointed. The owners fiancée was very nice and helpful, it being our first time. The food was very fresh and the stuffed avocado was absolutely amazing!!! I had the fresco bowl and half stuffed avocado and mom had the wings. A must try restaurant!!"}
{"text":"Absolutely incredible. The chicken is so flavorful and the staff is so friendly. Everything is so well run especially for it being so new. I totally recommend the stuffed avocado with chicken. It's not something you can get most places and it's heavenly. They also have incredible chorizo which is pretty hard to find. Make sure to top your dinner off with the tres leches. It's the best cake I've ever had hands down. Can't wait to see this business grow!!"}
{"text":"Not impressed. The food was cold and chicken didn't have any flavor. The service was not friendly or I could say it was like we were bothering. The employee that took my order was eating at the bar. Bathrooms could be clean better. There was a guy on a computer that didn't even make eye contact."}
{"text":"What.is.happening. Perhaps I should've read deeper into the reviews before making my choice tonight. This place is a copy of Viva Chicken, but yet, not Viva Chicken. Exact idea though. Half avocado, street corn pudding, mashed potatoes were my choices tonight.  And sweet tea.  The girl behind the counter was so nice and she was the star of the evening!! I thank her for her outstanding customer service.    After ordering my food, the rudest person in the universe came to bring it out, she brought the wrong order and tried to dispute that it was wrong..huh? I know what I just paid and asked for. Thank you. The sweet tea was gross so I asked her if they had or could make more and she was so unfriendly...basically saying no...& walking away without offering to help. I don't understand why she even works there. She shouldn't.  The nice girl brought our order out finally and also fixed up the tea for me.  It tasted a lot better.  The manager also came out to check up and she was really nice too.   The food was not my favorite.  The avocado was good. The corn was not what I expected. It was like corn soufflé only not sweet and basically flavorless.  Mashed potatoes were ok. The beans that my friend had were meh.   Overall...not thrilled, no desire to venture back. I wouldn't recommend nor go out of my way. Try at your own risk."}
{"text":"Amazing!!!! Passing through Charlotte and stopped for a local dish.. and I was blown away by the stuffed avocados!!"}
{"text":"Rooftop alert! Yes there's a cozy rooftop with a bar where you can order food, drinks, and the breeze. It's a chill place with an industrial feel. Walk to the counter to order, get your number, and find a table. Get the sauces! They are amazingly flavorful and really what makes the food shine. Roja and chimi-churri are great. Verde is good and spicy.   I ordered the fresco bowl: rice quinoa mix topped with delicious pickled red onions, avocado, pulled chicken, black beans, queso fresco (simple white cheese crumbles) for about $9. In less than 10 minutes we were eating!  There was a Dos Equis pint special for $3 but I was charged full price at $5. You can tell the MOST about a biz by the way they handle issues. The workers apologized and offered a $5 gift card. I accepted this even but believe they would've refunded me the $2 if I asked. Smart on their part since I have to return to use it."}
{"text":"This is my go to spot in Plaza Midwood right now. Amazing chicken, delicious sauces, fresh healthy ingredients, friendly staff, amazing space, cool upstairs patio with a view of Plaza - this place has it all! I get the rotisserie chicken either as half a chicken (a breast and a leg, marinated tender and perfectly herbed & spiced) or I get the chicken shredded in a bowl with quinoa and avocado or in a sandwich. You can't go wrong with anything on the menu! When we have guests we always take them to Coaltrane's!"}
{"text":"Food was good, wait was long for take out - I think they just missed my order.  1/4 chicken and sauces are good, but their 1/4 chicken seemed much smaller than then the repeat portions I have had at Viva Chicken (the best).    Corn as a side was good.  They forgot to given me a skewer so a bit messy for lunch.  Also only gave me a fork, hard to cut into chicken with a fork - lol.    Just opened a month ago, I'm sure they will improve."}
{"text":"I just recently discovered this place and I am obsessed! The wings are crispy, the sides are tasty. Try the salsa roja if you're not into spice like me."}
{"text":"Food nothing crazy, very very slow service, then after you waited 20 min for your food they tell you they were out of chicken. Came in before just to look at the menu but since we didn't stay and wanted to come back later members of the staff made rude remarks."}
{"text":"Fresco bowl and chargrill plater are really good.   I liked the sweet corn casserole and garlic mashed potatoes.  Haven't been upstairs but it looks cool from outside."}
{"text":"Coaltrane's is a wonderful experience, the food (which delicious), the atmosphere is awesome especially the music which is on point, and the staff was super friendly and attentive. I ordered a full Rotisserie Chicken and it was cooked perfectly, juicy and flavorful throughout, and the skin was perfect, also came conveniently quartered so no hassle serving. Came with 3 sides which I enjoyed all of, the Garlic Mashed Potatoes were out of the world, Green Beans were fresh and cooked perfectly, and the Corn Casserole was great \"comfort\" side. All in all it was a fantastic meal, and surprisingly affordable. Definitely recommended!"}
{"text":"Had the 1/4 chicken (dark) with red beans with chorizo and rice.  Overall the portion size was rather small, but sufficient for lunch. The chicken was pretty dry and bland. I've had better rotisserie chicken from Walmart. The red beans with chorizo was very tasty, but there was very little chorizo. The sauces were decent, but they are not nearly as good as competing restaurants like Viva Chicken. The jalapeno based sauce is not very spicy.  There was only one person taking orders and there was a bit of a wait to place your order. The food came within about 20 minutes of walking in the door on a Friday so this wasn't that big of a deal. However, because of the long line, several customers opted to leave and go somewhere else.   The others in my party said the sandwiches and salads they ordered were very good.  This place is very close to my office so it is very convenient. I had hoped for a better experience. I will likely give them another shot, but my hopes will not be very high. I hear the steak is good as are the stuffed avocados."}
{"text":"Sunday afternoon lunch (late), this place was a little dead, but then people started rolling in.  The poor staffers got hit pretty hard, but luckily, it looks like they handle pressure well.  Tried the stuffed avocado and the chorizo sandwhich.  Anything with chorizo is a winner in my book.  I've had their chicken at a couple of event in Charlotte so it was interesting seeing their place of operations.  Great spot in the middle of the EpiCenter.  I know the greek place that used to be here was definitely unique since the bar extends on outside for some outdoor seating (a couple of tables too).  Their numbering system needs to be reworked since the cards are way too big for the poor, tiny stands that kept falling over with a stiff exhale.  Order up at the counter and grab your own silverware (on the wall).  Definitely fast-casual place with some big flavors."}
{"text":"Man I love this place. Especially Music Bingo Friday! Get there early for a  good seat on the rooftop patio."}
{"text":"Audry was delightful in my fist visit to Coaltrane's. Showed us around the place and treated us to great drinks as well. Definitely recommend to anyone new to the Midwood neighborhood as well as the residents. Service from everyone was A1!!!"}
