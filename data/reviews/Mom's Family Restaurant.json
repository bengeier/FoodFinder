{"text":"Amazing soups and new amazing chef! The food is always cooked just right! I would recommend the chopped sirloin with fries and gravy over everything! The bacon egg and cheese skillet is amazing to!"}
{"text":"Breakfast can't be beat. The service, the prices, the selection, and the quality have made Mom's a 5 star spot.   Mom's is not a trendy place. It's small, it's quiet, it's filled with regulars, and the decor feels like grandma's house when you were growing up. The service is friendly and not fake. The prices are remarkably low for the amount of food you're served, and the menu is filled with staples. If you want a fast breakfast or if you want to hang out and have a few coffees and not be bothered, this is your place."}
{"text":"This place Potato Soup is 5 stars. You can only get it on Saturdays. It's like crack (I never tried crack in my life) but if I did, I would assume the feeling is like that.  All their food is cheap and service is friendly. They take credit too.   Again, I post this for every small diner and it's mainly the reason why they don't have 5 stars. U Please read below: No frills type of place. It's what you call a greasy spoon. You can't go wrong if you know what you're in for. Your bill should never be over $12, unless you leaving a 30% tip. I never order their orange juice it's high as F%*%*% and it's not the calcium kind. Not sure but it could be Reiters orange juice (just saying). Just stick to water. They'll charge you on the refills too."}
{"text":"used to consider this a good breakfast place, but when I started going more often after doc said I needed more iron w food, started going there for liver dinner. chef adds bacon for me and it's always so tender and done perfectly...and whomever I can rope in to going to see me eat liver, has given great reviews on what they ordered. tasty food and great value. try it!"}
{"text":"If you're looking for a quick bite to eat with unbeatable prices and outstanding food, Mom's is the place to go! I love that this is a locally owned \"mom-and-pop\" restaurant with a wonderfully quaint atmosphere. The quality (and quantity!) of the food cannot be beat, especially for the price you pay. I'd chose breakfast at Mom's over any other restaurant's - hands down!"}
{"text":"Fantastic find. Quick, good food, clean.   Came in for lunch on a Tuesday. Had the Turkey triple decker BLT with a cup of soup. The soup of the day was cream of chicken. Only mistake I made was getting a cup rather than a bowl. It was outstanding. Very hot, great flavor, and pretty simple.   The BLT was nothing special, but came out as expected. Mayo on the bread was good. With a glass of water, the agile check was $6.64.   Service was quick and friendly. Lots of regulars here, which tells you something. If you get a booth in the corner next to the old timers, you might leave learning a few things :-)   Four stars for food and service, 5 stars for value."}
{"text":"Not the best food ever but affordable I guess. The gravy is terrible. The waitress brought me dirty silverware but never a refill."}
{"text":"Bonefide dinner.   Very cheap.  No frills.  Patty melt was good - - average good.  However they do form their own patties and the burger itself was fresh.  Hand cut fries were very good.  Requested a side of gyro sauce for dipping - - it was homemade, garlicky goodness.  Interior is a bit sketchy.  Big chunks of upholstery/foam were missing on the back supports of the booths.  It was clean but being old and worn, it gives an appearance that it's dirty.  Excellent waitress.  Prompt service, very informative, helpful and friendly."}
{"text":"Cleveland sure had a lot of great breakfast places when I lived there.  Sadly, The Big Egg is gone, and many of the other places that were great I can't remember the names of, but I do remember Mom's quite fondly.  It's your standard Sunday-morning breakfast fare, except they serve it every day of the week.  Expect to wait for a table on weekends, but the wait won't be long, and the service is good.  The food is really delicious, well worth the four stars I've giving the entire establishment."}
{"text":"Great place to go eat some breakfast at.  I was there 2 weeks ago and ordered steak and eggs.  I had a steak called the button steak, it was huge. If you have not eaten there, go check it out, I'm a repeat customer and I do not have any complaints yet."}
{"text":"I don't like writing a poor review for a local place.  I'd been here before off-and-on through the years and thought it was fine back then-- perhaps the ownership has changed?    I stopped in on an early Friday afternoon with a hankering for breakfast.    Hardly anyone was there, so I thought it would be quick!  On the contrary,  lots of awkward waiting around... first to get seated, second to order, and finally to pay... it seemed that only the owner is permitted to operate the cash register and they had to find him-- it all seemed a bit odd.  Furthermore, maybe it was the waiting and I had time to look around, but the place seemed dingier than I remembered it.  Everything smelled of frying oil, including myself after I left... and worst of all, the omelette seemed under-done.  I will say the coffee refills kept coming, so it wasn't all bad, but overall things seemed mostly amiss."}
{"text":"I love this place! Always very friendly and welcoming... My favorite is the chopped sirloin with fries and gravy over everything!! Always come out just right.. The soups are very tasty to! The potato and Kabasa is very good to but is only made on select Tuesday's.. Very generous prices!"}
{"text":"I had a fantastic breakfast at a very low price with fantastic service. I don't know how they do it."}
