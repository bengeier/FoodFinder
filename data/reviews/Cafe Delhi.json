{"text":"My wife and I are visiting Pittsburgh from the Indian food wasteland that is South Carolina, and craving our favorite food we consulted Yelp, which resulted in a trip to Cafe Delhi in Carnegie.

I will start with criticism and then will move on to praise (of which I wish to heap a great deal).  The ambiance of Cafe Delhi is not very nice, reminiscent of a cheap takeaway restaurant in London in which the food is considered important but the act of dining is a mere afterthought.  The tables are not very nice, the walls fairly plain, and you order at a counter rather than a waiter visiting your table.  There is no alcohol served but BYOB is acceptable, and they do provide a bottle opener and wine glasses should you bring a nice vino.  The menus are a single laminated sheet of paper, and are honestly a bit on the grungy side.  If your goal is to eat fine Indian food, then do not let these observations alarm you.  If you are properly armed with these expectations, Cafe Delhi will be a very good experience.  

Our visit was on a snowy Pittsburgh evening.  We parked in the public parking lot nearly behind the building, which is free after 6pm.  A very brief walk delivered us to the threshold of Cafe Delhi.  Upon entering, we were handed our menus and instructed to order at the counter once we'd made our decision.  They immediately noticed our bottle of wine and brought us wine glasses and a bottle opener. 

We seated ourselves at a table of our choosing in a corner, and my wife and I both decided on the Butter Chicken.  I often try this on a first visit to an Indian restaurant to gauge the quality of the food, and even if it is not the most complex in flavour, if done well will still deliver a delightful taste and texture.  We were asked how hot we would like our dishes, to which end my wife had mild and I medium.  I initially said 'hot' but was warned that 'hot' was a 10 on a scale of 1 to 10.  We were asked if we wanted naan or rice, which was a little unexpected as in my experience this isn't usually an either/or proposition, but I opted to pay a bit more and had both.  We also ordered vegetable samosas as an appetizer, which we did not regret.  I requested mango chutney but was told they only carried tamarind and mint chutneys, which was quite acceptable.

After a wait of about 10 to 15 minutes our samosas arrived.  I had actually asked for \"two samosas\" but this was evidently received as \"two orders\", in which there are two per order.  No matter, as this allowed us to have a bit more the next day.  The samosas were crispy on the outside and soft on the inside, just as they should be.  The taste was excellent, and rivaled that of fine Indian restaurants I've eaten at in other cities.  Both chutneys tasted very good; the tamarind was a bit on the sweet side and the mint had a nice spice and bite to it.

Our entrees arrived about two minutes later which was a bit too soon, but again, no matter.  With one samosa dispatched apiece, we moved on to our Butter Chicken.  We were not disappointed.  The sauce was smooth and creamy, with a nice silkiness.  The taste was exquisite, and we savoured every bite.  The individual spices are discernible, and you can tell that they do not merely rely on fat to make a good flavour.

The naan was also very hot and tasty, and provided just enough crispness to delight the senses.

If you eat slowly and savour each bite, whatever shortcomings Cafe Delhi may have can be easily overlooked. C'est bon!"}
{"text":"Chicken Kurma was really good. Naan was also awesome.
We had been waiting for more than half an hour, though. Anyway, it was worth waiting for."}
{"text":"Made to order, so give yourself 30 minutes for a hot and freshly prepared meal.
Various heat scale flexibility, and a very extensive menu variety.
Dress is casual, and during the warm weather, there is a private courtyard for outside dining.
Great vegetarian selections, and equally ample meat offers, including wonderfully prepared Goat Curry.
Finish with a cup of Masala Chai Tea and choices from ice-cream; Mango Lassi; 
Ras Malai (sweet cottage cheese with pistachio and rose water); and much more.
-Friendly Staff
-Order at counter and choose a seat
-Reasonably priced
-Authentic Indian Cuisine
-Casual ambience
** Will Return Often**!"}
{"text":"Really good food. 4 of us went to this restaurant on a recent trip to Pittsburgh. We ordered chilli chicken, daal makhani, goat curry and chicken tikka masala. All the dishes tasted amazing. We had onion and garlic naans which were really soft. The staff was friendly, our server Chanda, was terrific. I wish toronto had restaurants like this."}
{"text":"Love the food. Generally get take out. My favs are the samosa chaat and the kadhai paneer (not listed on the menu). Must try them."}
{"text":"Delicious food. I usually get the chicken  tikka masala with plain naan. Clean and casual. Small  quaint place to eat. Friendly staff. Good service."}
{"text":"AMAZING. So happy to find really delicious Indian food closer to Steubenville. Very easy on the wallet, and REALLY really good. Found this restaurant on yelp, and found that all its fantastic reviews are true. 

There were several young Indian families at the restaurant while we were there, which gave me even more confidence that this was authentic food, and worth trying again and again. Can't wait until next time."}
{"text":"One of the best places I've been for India food. Curry unique and I'm always satisfied with the food. We drive from Beaver all the time to get the food here. Vegetable pakora and gobi Manchurian out some of our favorites. They have a nice court yard as well in the summer for dinning outdoors."}
{"text":"This is the best india in the area.  I regularly get the chicken chettinad which is savory and very spicy.  The cut mirchi and gobi manchurian are always a hit as well.  If you are not used to eating spicy food go easy.  Ordering a 5-6 here will get you sweating.  We have never had a problem bringing a group here and they are always very accommodating with seating and providing us glasses for our byob."}
{"text":"Nice place directly on the corner of Main St. and Mary St.  If you aren't familiar with Indian food, ordering may be a bit challenging.  The menu on the wall behind the counter only lists the items with no description.  However, while we were eating we did notice someone waiting to order who was flipping through something that looked like it was a more detailed version of the menu with pictures.  Not sure if that's what it was, but I may ask next time when I bring the hubby who only knows Indian food by site (he frequents Indian buffets).  Although, the staff seemed friendly enough that I'm sure they wouldn't mind describing the items if asked. 

The food came out fairly quickly (although there weren't many other diners at that time) and our waters were never empty for long.  I got the Malai Kofta with a side of naan (you get a choice of naan or rice with your entr√©e).  It was very tasty and creamy, but a bit on the salty side.  The side of naan was hot, fresh, buttery and plentiful (I couldn't even eat all of it, which never happens to me when it comes to bread).  My friend, who frequents the place, ordered the Chicken Tikka Masala and said it is always very good.  

Overall I thoroughly enjoyed this place and will be back!"}
{"text":"Chat items are ok but don't try the bajjji which was crispy like pappad. Service was moderate and the the one serving us told bajjji is liked that way!!!  Crap"}
{"text":"I wish Yelp had 0 review point. This place has the worst service I have ever seen. Food takes about 35 mins to arrive every time. Arrogant staff. Food quality sucks. Please don't waste time going to this restaurant."}
{"text":"I would describe it as a hidden gem. A great variety of food and for a reasonable price. I would suggest sitting outside as their patio section is great. My favorite dish is spinach chicken for sure!"}
{"text":"Their lamb biryani is the best! Definitely worth trying. We eat here at least once a week - better than any other indian restaurant in pittsburgh area!"}
{"text":"Good food. Nice service but need to update to yelp about hours. Came here at 4 pm was closed"}
{"text":"Hello Delhi! I kept seeing signs for this on my way back from work. Tucked away in an unassuming corner off of Mansfield Blvd, Cafe Delhi is a treat for your taste buds. Their concept breaks the typical Indian restaurant mold. Fast food, tea, coffee, Indian specialty beverages and tapas at reasonable prices! The menu is simple with recognizable Indian dishes as well as some new ones. This place is meant for snacking and take out. 

I ordered two popular Indian snacks, Pani Puri and Papdi chaat. Pani puri (fry bread with water - literally) consists of little puffs of fried crispy dough filled with spiced potatoes and cilantro chutney. They come with a small pouring bowl filled with spicy savory water that's slightly chilled. The perfect way to eat them is to fill your golden crisp puff with the water and pop it in your mouth before the water spills out. Eating it without making a mess is an art to be mastered! Cafe Delhi's pani puri and Papdi chaat were fresh and tasty. I loved every bite - it was the perfect wrap up for a busy week. Steven ordered his Indian staple, Paneer Tikka Masala with Naan. The masala base was creamy and spicy with green peppers and onions. The Paneer rightfully was the true star of this dish. Soft and succulent, this Paneer was melt in your mouth good - a 9.5 on the yumm factor.  I enjoyed my first adventure at Cafe Delhi and am already planning the next one!"}
{"text":"Great lunch spot.  Delicious curries and other Indian meals.  Best part is they really kick up the spiciness if you want it.  Reasonably priced and your food comes fairly quickly."}
{"text":"Cafe Delhi is a breath of fresh air in a town that's been overrun by pizza shops (is there an ordinance that requires one on EVERY block???). I stop by weekly for an enjoyable lunch experience. I've tried almost everything on the menu and I haven't found anything that's not to like. I did find the goat dishes to be overly gamey & it is served bone-in, so be prepared to get your fingers yellow. I do enjoy the lamb curry, chicken kurma and the lamb wraps. The only bad points are the soda is usually flat and ice seems to be a commodity. 

If your looking for some tasty Indian cuisine give Cafe Delhi a try."}
{"text":"Awesome food,has a north Indian touch which rarely can be found in USA. Best Indian food in pittsburgh"}
{"text":"Loved the food, but we waited an incredibly long time for it. I would definitely come back."}
{"text":"I'm new at this so...Overall the food was very good..and reasonabley priced...the menu could of been better explained other than that it was very enjoyable."}
{"text":"Could not agree more. The food is authentic and fresh. Prices are reasonable, however for the dessert portions a little overpriced. The curry and spices were used just right. Great place!"}
{"text":"Best food, I have had so far!! If you visit Pittsburgh and need Indian food, this is a place to visit."}
{"text":"Hands down the worst service experience I have ever had in my life.

I dont write off a place because of customer service but this place was beyond belief. 

Our order which we payed for prior to eating was mixed up with another table and were asked to pay for the incorrect order in addition to what we had paid for.

When asked to speak to the manager - I was told to write a review on Yelp (No Joke)!!"}
{"text":"I finally have a decent Indian restaurant close to where I live. I ordered take out so I cannot comment on the restaurant experience. The kadai paneer was delicious. I love the fact that you can choose between rice or naan for your side.  I hope to go back again sometime soon and choose between their many choices. It appears that they also have dosas, which will be my next choice!"}
{"text":"Delicious, authentic Indian food and a friendly wait staff.

It can be crowded at lunch time but isn't that one of the ways to gauge how good the food is?

The menu has a wide variety of options and prices are reasonable.

Best naan in town!"}
{"text":"Love this cozy, unassuming little place. A relaxing quite hangout and friendly staff. But most importantly, one of the best Indian place in the East Coast. Layers of flavored but not drenched in grease. Lots of traditional favorites and some Indo-Chinese dishes. Don't hesitate to try their traditional desserts and cakes....a delicious finish to a good meal."}
{"text":"Heard about this place from my bf. Its in the same building complex as the Carnegie Indian Community Center, so that has to give some klout, right? I ordered the chicken Dum Biryani. Good amount of food, ordered a level 6 and it was perfectly spicy for my tastes...just the right amount of spice to make me sniffle! My bf ordered the chicken Chettinad. His was yummy. Had a bit of coconut milk, just enough to taste it, not overly sweet. We also had the chili chicken appetizer, which is almost like an indian General Tso's. Two entrees, appetizer, mango lassi, all for $25. Great meals for a reasonable price.  This is now my go-to Indian restaurant.  

On a side note, I asked one of the staff what time they closed.  She said its supposed to be 9:30, but if they aren't busy, they close earlier, around 8 or 8:30.  So if you are expecting them to be open for a late night meal, you probably should call first before you make the trip!"}
{"text":"This restaurant would be probably be good if it wasn't too busy, when we came in the restaurant there was no one to greet us, and a long time to wait longer than they told us to wait. The food when it finally arrived was coming very slowly and having many intervals between dishes. The food was fine except it came in very little quantity. The restaurant wasn't too big even the outside area was small. The way to order food isn't traditional either you have to go all the way to the front of the restaurant to order and the price is OK. Overall don't go here if you have a lot of people with you. I recommend small groups."}
{"text":"Fantastic Indian cuisine. This is my favorite Indian restaurant. I love the dal mahkni. It is attached to a church. The owners are a part if it. The outdoor seating is quaint. The naan is excellent. I love the garlic naan. It is a must to try this place. They are closed on Mondays and they have weird hours otherwise, so call first."}
{"text":"Divine Indian cuisine in Carnegie...yep, you heard me...in Carnegie.  The selection of vegetarian dishes are amazeballs!  The place is friendly enough and can fit a crowd, which we brought on our recent venture to the cafe. The Veg Manchurian just blew me away...not something I had tried before and it was amazing!  Be prepared for quite a lot of heat.  The place is happily BYOB.  I only dock a point for the ordering process of coming up to the counter.  They seemed to have plenty of staff on hand and they brought food to our table, so it was confusing as to why they have it set up that way."}
{"text":"I ordered for a chicken biryani for take out and noticed they gave me a vegetable biryani instead after I reached home. I called them and explained the situation. I was so upset and thank you Cafe Delhi for making me starve during the night. The next day I drove back to return the veg biryani and take a refund of my money, they started to foolishly argue that they cannot refund the card payment but will instead give me a chicken biryani. What the hell do you want me to do with that? You want to replace a mistaken order the next day. You should be more than a genius to do that. Hats off to you guys!!"}
{"text":"We drove there from Oakland  just for food.   We have been told that this is the best Indian restaurant in Pittsburgh and yeah..we weren't disappointed. You can tell that this place must have authentic Indian food by people in the restaurant. All are Indian. When you go there, you need to order food at the counter. I love mango lassi there. It is not too sweet, just right. For appetizer, I go with Gobi Manchurian (cauliflower flitters with spicy sauce)."}
{"text":"I have been here many times and it never disappoints. Naan is always fresh and delicious. Tandoori chicken is crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside. Butter chicken and spinach chicken are both fantastic. Kadai chicken is my new go to. It is a great tomato based stir fry. (Big chicken fan overall if you can't tell). Everything is served fresh and hot. 
The service is always good. Order at the register, sit at your table with a number card and your food will be there in 10-15 minutes. Staff is friendly and helpful. This is my favorite Indian restaurant in Pittsburgh. Worth the trip to Carnegie."}
{"text":"Terrible place. Service is the worst. Food portions are so small. Tastes good but not that good. This place is SO DIRTY."}
{"text":"Poor service, the staff asked customers if they could clear the tables while people were eating their last bites of food! The wait time is horrible!! Food is good, may be they should be a take out place.. Very disappointed"}
{"text":"YUM! My favorite indian place...very fast for my office lunch schedule and decently priced.

I LOVE their garlic naan and chicken vindaloo is the best.  Gobi Manchurian was good, although I've had better, I would order again.

PLEASE OPEN ON MONDAYS!"}
{"text":"I came here with my coworker on a Sunday for dinner and we ordered some delicious food. 
The service was quick and the staff was friendly. 
I ordered the lamb spiced level 2 which was plenty for me, and my coworker ordered goat curry level 6, and it was hotter than hell for her lol. 
She was sweating with the heat but she loved it. What a sight to see, I must say! The garlic naan is spectacular and is highly recommend trying it with your food. I also ordered chicken tikki masala to go level 2 and it was so good! I will definitely return again!"}
{"text":"Best indian food near Pittsburgh. Very well crafted dishes. Service is exceptional and turn around time for food to arrive at your table is excellent."}
{"text":"This one is tough: the food was really good, but everything else was really rough. You order at the counter and they bring it to the table of your choice. But there was no one at the counter for about 5 minutes as 4 of us patrons waited to place orders. Eventually an attendant came by, but apparently the patrons that call in their orders are given preference to those at the counter. If I hadn't been craving Indian food as badly as I was, I would have walked out.
The cafe was very loud with children screaming and running around. The floors were slick and greasy.
But in the end, the food was delicious."}
{"text":"Careless staff. I just ordered 1 dish for take out, I was told it will take about 20 minutes, since there is naan, it gets cold so I waited in the restaurant. They took 40 minutes to give the food, it is just chicken curry. It was Saturday just opened the restaurant at 4:30, my order was given at 4:38 PM and I pick up at 5:20 PM.  NAAN was cold as if it was cooked during lunch. The restaurant is also not very trendy but prices are very trendy. Recently many Indians are coming on H1B and making big salaries as technical and managerial, these guys simply see the demand and keep rising the prices without quality. The tables are very small so I do not prefer to eat in the restaurant. Avoid this place. They just rob you. Greed everywhere, the order taking lady was very lazy, did not even bother to answer me when I asked for my order, carelessly sometimes say not ready. They think customers have no choice but to eat there."}
{"text":"Good navratan korma. My husband got butter chicken which was also delicious. Finally we got chicken 65 to snack on later. Really glad they were open on Easter. Prices were reasonable but portions were on the small side."}
{"text":"Not just the best Indian food in Pittsburgh, it's the best Indian food I've ever had. I've had lamb vindaloos from all over the world and none match up to the quality of Cafe Dehli. The lamb is sooo tender, and the sauce is perfectly balanced. I just recently moved to Denver and the thing I'll miss most about Pittsburgh is Cafe Dehli."}
{"text":"One of my favorite Indian places in the Burgh! It's a hidden gem in Carnegie that's worth stopping by.

The restaurant itself can get busy during expected hours of service (lunch and dinner) so if you want it fast, order ahead and carry out. They do have a period of time that they are closed during the day, I believe from about 4:30-5:30pm, so that is something to be mindful of when planning a visit. 

My favorite dish is the Malai Kofta with rice AND naan. You can't go wrong with their naan. It's so soft and buttery and everything I need. This dish is a nice balance of savory and sweet and is exceptionally filling. The Palak Paneer and Paneer Tikka Masala are also exceptional plates as well. As a vegetarian, I enjoy the robust options to select from. As others have noted, if you don't enjoy super spicy foods, stick with a 3 or 4 level. I've never braved anything more than this just because I am a creature of habit and stick with what I know."}
{"text":"We tried this place tonight on a whim and unfortunately ended up walking out after 10-15 minutes.  

Staff barely spoke and instead handed us a menu. No one bothered to communicate that we had to find our own seat.

After we decided what to order, we were then informed it that would take 45 minutes to prepare and serve the food.  Why should it take so long when there were barely any customers in the dining area at 7:30pm on a Friday evening?

Staff did not seem to be knowledgeable concerning food allergies, which could be potentially life threatening to my child who has a nut and shellfish allergy.

My wife and I finally decided to take our business elsewhere!"}
{"text":"Chile chicken is Awesome, fresh everything. They will customize your spice level, I am a white boy so I get a level 3. Wonder what 10 is like?"}
{"text":"Was there for an event in the banquet so not really familiar with the restaurant. But the food served at the event was delicious! From chats to maincourse everything was brilliant!"}
{"text":"More than one reason to love this place. Whether it is Gobi Manchurian or Samosa chaat or Paneer tikka masala, it is always delicious. Additionally everything of reasonably priced."}
{"text":"Very good food great service excellent family place......I would love to give it a 4 or higher but the meet in portions are getting less and less. My family eats here at least 5 times a month and this time I had to call to complain after ordering $61 in food and it was 80% sauce ...I called to tell them how disappointed I was and they corrected the situation by remaking 1/2 my order....

But when prices are rising faster than salaries and eating out is a choice not a necessity and when your dollars have options consistency matters.

I'll give it one more chance and I hope it will continue to be my restaurant of choice"}
{"text":"Ok, so I have never really had Indian food before. Some Curry dishes here and there, but that is it. From my first experience with going to a full on Indian restaurant, I loved this place! Connected to an Indian Community Center, this place is so simple, but very tasty. I had Vegetable Samosas and Chicken Tikka Marsala! Awesome. Only went level 3 on the spice for the chicken and still got a runny nose and a little toasty. I will be back for sure!!!"}
{"text":"I work down the street and I want to get my lunch from this place every day. The sauces are thick and delicious, everything I've had has been exceptionally good. I highly recommend this place if you enjoy Indian food."}
{"text":"Great Indian food and the price is right. We are an hour away, sadly, but eager to return."}
{"text":"Highlyrecommended... excellent food quick service... i loved chicken biryani... samaosa chat veg fried rice and many more..."}
{"text":"I like their food and my mom and I usually go here to eat whenever I'm in town. HOWEVER, today my mom and I walked in at 2:25 with the OPEN sign lit. We were greeted by some dirty looks from all the staff sitting down at tables eating.  A girl got up from the table, walked behind the counter and said \"you want menus?\".  We said yes and began to look at what we wanted to order.  A guy behind us sitting at a table said \"excuse me? Excuse me! Are u trying to order?\"  Which we responded \"yes\" & thinking why else would we be looking at menus and standing at the counter. He abruptly said \"we are closed!\" We said the open sign is on? Confused, thinking well why did you hand us menus? We received no answers and the girl ran over to shut the open sign off.  So we walked out pretty disgusted by the service receiving no apology for the confusion.  As we walked out we realized they close at 2:30 and open again at 4:30.  They just didn't want to serve us so close to closing for 2 hrs. There was no consideration or offer of a to-go order or anything. SO RUDE! No respect for frequent and loyal customers. Well we are NOT going back!!"}
{"text":"For a fast, casual Indian restaurant, Cafe Delhi is great. I might not go out of my way to go here, but it's convenient for me, affordable (especially lunch), and take out is always fast (I rarely ever eat in here). Lunch is the best deal. I enjoyed the Malai Kofta but was disappointed that there were only two dumplings; my other standby Channa Masala is always good. Naan seems to be kind of variable, but not sure how much of that is a factor of getting it to go."}
{"text":"We always look for Indian whenever we travel since we have none to speak of in Charleston. We chose this place because it was in route to our destination. I was excited being that it was attached to an Indian culture center and the clientele was mainly Indian. Unfortunately it was not to our liking. The food had good taste but was way too creamy... we felt like every dish had heavy cream added. We are used to the veggies and spices ringing through for the Indian we like. The spinach paneer is usually mainly just spinach with the chunks of paneer but this was more of a spinach soup with cream base. We were also disappointed there were no dishes with eggplant. Surprising for us. In any case, the food had good flavor but felt it was more of a \"fast food\" Indian joint than a restaurant."}
{"text":"Without a doubt the best Indian food in Pittsburgh. Very simple and unassuming from the outside and even when you walk in, but the food speaks for itself. My wife and I eat here at least a couple times a month and have had most of the menu - we have never been disappointed!"}
{"text":"Great Chicken Tikka Masala!  Just ordered a paneer wrap for the first time, awesome... We have never eaten there, always getting takeout because it appears to be a busy busy loud-ish family place, which is great but we are not always in the mood for that type of vibe when dining as a couple.  Food never disappoints! Good Value!"}
{"text":"Tasty and affordable.  I especially like the palak paneer and goat kurma.  My son loves the tandoori chicken."}
{"text":"My husband kept telling me about this place when he was driving for Uber eats so on the way home from the airport we decided to stop in and were pleasantly surprised. We had the chicken lollipops and naan as an app as well as a vegetarian dish and one with meat. The apps were great and the dishes were very flavorful and delicious. We have since then got take out this time had chicken 65 but prefer the chicken lollipops. We were once again pleased with our food."}
{"text":"A friend of mine, a vegetarian and sometimes vegan, is a regular here and invited me to come along so I could get my Indian food fix. I am not vegetarian so I ordered the spinach chicken. It was a little different from what I'm used to as the spinach was completely pur√©ed in the sauce, but the flavor was so good! The spice level I chose (6) was perfect in the amount of heat. The chicken was good quality and the naan that I ordered with it was perfectly chewy, crispy, and buttery. We split the samosas which I could tell were freshly made as they were piping hot and super crisp. I could make a meal out of them alone. My friend ordered a dosa which I tried and I'd definitely venture to order that next time. The accompanying sauces were so delicious! I give the food a 5 star review. The space itself is clean and orderly, but there were space heaters out on the floor. It was an especially cold day so the constant flow of take out orders and door opening over and over left the dining area pretty chilly. Service was pleasant. You order at the counter and then go to a table with your number. I can't wait to try more!"}
{"text":"Definitely a good surprise!

Not knowing where to go on a Friday night, we decided we wanted to try something new.  After settling Indian, I briefly remembered some buzz around a cafe out in the Carnegie area (who'da guessed?).

Cafe Delhi is part of an Indian cultural center, which at first thought, I wasn't sure if I was going to get knock your socks off good staples or the equivalent of ho-hum church cafeteria food...  good thing it was the first!

The staff were all great.  They use an at-the-counter ordering method, so after placing our order, we went outside to the small garden patio and grabbed a table.  We were quickly met with water (kinda a hybrid semi-full service...  think Buffalo Wild Wings) and asked if we would want anything else. 

Both my Butter Chicken and the Wife's Chicken Vindaloo were fantastic (although we both left feeling slightly weighted down...  they don't call it butter chicken for no reason).

We'll definitely go back at some point.  For some lack of oversight, I failed to order myself a few of their variations of naan bread, so that will be enough reason alone to revisit this gem!"}
{"text":"While the menu here has plenty of vegetarian options, they don't offer much in the way of actual vegetables. And the food is just not good. I went with another person, and we chose the Navratan Korma and Chicken Chettinad to share. Navratan Korma, when made well, is the jewel in a good Indian chef's repertoire. It's a Mughlai dish that features \"nine gems\", a mix of nine vegetables and sometimes paneer cheese in a rich creamy sauce with some nuts and dried fruit. It's a rich dish, and I usually avoid it if there is another curry on the menu that doesn't feature cream, but, as I said, vegetables were scarce. The korma that arrived at our table wasn't a korma at all, but previously frozen vegetables (I can always tell...can't you?) in a sauce that had the color and flavor of a processed cheese sauce. Kind of like Kraft macaroni and cheese without the macaroni. This dish is an affront to the idea of korma, and laughably bad. 

We fared a little better with the chicken chettinad, which was spicy and somewhat flavorful, although the chicken was served in a bowl that was too small for the contents, and it hadn't been cut into small enough pieces to eat without a knife. I wasn't actually given a knife to use, but had I been, I would have made a mess of my plate. 

I have no idea why you would have air fresheners in your dining room. Air fresheners are meant to go in a bathroom, where I still don't like them, but understand their use. Every 30 seconds or so the 2 wall mounted units sent another spritz of chemical aroma into the dining room. Yuck. Dining rooms should smell of food. Maybe these people don't even have that much confidence in their cooking skills. It's too bad, as this is a nice location near a charming stretch of Main Street. Needless to say, I won't be returning."}
{"text":"Easily the best for Gobi Manchurian and Mushroom Manchurian.   Little bit on the spicy side.. so what drink a glass of milk once you reach home ;-)

Everything else also tastes good.   If you are looking Indo-Chinese food then this will be your best bet."}
{"text":"1) Order ahead on the phone or on Yelp/Eat24 if you want to do a pick up. The place gets busy in the evenings and not the most coordinated service you'll find. 

2) The food is like any other average Indian restaurant you'll find in town. Nothing special but nothing to bash it for either. 

3) It can be a hit or miss with the level of spice. 

Note to the new comers to Indian Food - If you cannot tolerate that burning heat in your Indian food, stress that when ordering food. Remember, \"spicy\" is not always indicative of the \"heat\" in your food. Many people make this mistake, as these terms are used interchangeably, confusing things further. Remember, the heat in Indian food is mainly due to addition of fresh green chili, red chili powder or flakes, ground black pepper, and sometimes ginger. Asking the chef to skip only the first two items won't make the food less delicious. Your food will instead be mild, still tasty, and won't burn your insides or give you acidity/heartburn if you are prone to it. 

4) Samosa chat (a bit on the hot side), dosas, butter chicken, breads, and \"biryani\" rice are my favorites from this place. EDIT: Butter chicken is EXCELLENT. 

5) The place is kind of expensive for the amount of food you get."}
{"text":"4 stars overall.

In my opinion, the best indian food in town (second best if you include Chez Moi or Chez anybody who's indian mom cooks up a storm).

Anyhow, when I move to a new town, my staples are where is the nearest Taco Bell (oh look...what's that falling straight to hell...well the validity of all my reviews of course - it's a Indian thing, you won't get it), where is the nearest Zara (fail), where is the nearest coffee shop, and what's the best indian restaurant in town.

Well, I tried them all in Pittsburgh except for this one given it's location out in the boondocks of Carnegie. A colleague recommended it and he said it's the closest thing to \"restaurant style\" indian food you're going to get that is reminiscent of India and back east(er) in Queens, NY.

So I went.

I ate.

I was conquered.

If it is anything I know, it's Indian food.

This is great food. My go to's are the Chicken Malai Kabab (very well cooked, juicy pieces of tender chicken breast marinated in yogurt, cheese, cilantro, ginger among other spices), the spinach chicken and the Chicken Pepper Fry.

One of the reasons why Indian Food in general can be unhealthy is the extraordinary amount of oil or cream. I love their butter chicken and tikka masala but their butter chicken is loaded with cream (I can see the fat separate sometimes) as well as the Spinach chicken (but not much because spinach can be creamed by cooking it well). The tikka masala is great but it seems like they forgot  a key ingredient in theirs which would be black cardamoms and Javentri (Mace) which gives it that flavor. The butter chicken is on point, and the spinach chicken is too die for. Perfectly cooked pieces of dark meat in a spinach curry laced with cloves. It's like eating crack.

I love that it comes with naan or rice so I usually get one of each. The naan is your typical naan, nothing extraordinary.

My review for this place is overall quality and taste of food which I think they nailed.

My only thing is, for take out, I think they can give a little bit more meat in their dishes...JUST saying, sometimes there is way more gravy than protein and well, that is no Bueno considering other restaurants really don't do this.

Saved by the bell in that their food surpasses others in the area so Kudos."}
{"text":"This place is delicious! The staff is friendly and the food is fresh. I'll be back and probably sooner then later"}
{"text":"Yum. Yum. Yum. A co-worker and a friend had recommended this place for Indian food. It's a long drive from Cranberry Township but definitely worth the drive. This cafe is really a cafe - you order food at the counter, take a number and they bring out the food to you. I believe it's a  BYOB place since I saw some people outside pulling out a bottle of wine. (Hint: there's a wine/spirits store a block away.) Anyway, I had the mango lassi, chicken lollipop, goat vindaloo and chili (chily) paneer. All were delicious! I also ordered a caramel cake but sadly forgot to eat it. The gentleman at the counter was so nice, he threw in a pineapple cake in at no charge. My friend said it was fantastic and that she would go back just for the cake! We are definitely coming back when the urge for Indian food arises."}
{"text":"Wonderful!  My husband and I love this place and pick up lunch from here almost every Saturday.  I wish they had a counter in the Robinson Mall so I could snack there all the time."}
{"text":"Probably the best butter chicken I've had! And super friendly service, everyone was really nice. I arrived 10mins before quoted for my take out order and they gave me tea while I waited - I felt like family in here! I've always taken to go but it seems like it would be cozy to eat in. They also give choice of rice or naan with the dishes which is uncommon and amazing for us naan-lovers!"}
{"text":"We are new to Pittsburgh came here on friend suggestion. We almost 10 people had a dinner tried veg and non veg, everything was delicious and very much Indian taste. Service is also very good."}
{"text":"Wow. This place by far exceeded my expectations! the parking was super convenient. Had a small wait because the place was not only packed Inside, but also with to go orders as well. Cafe style, order at counter. The food runners, cashier, and waitress were all very attentive and kind. My food was AMAZING! Hot and fresh, just the right amount of spice! I can't wait to come back here! Loved it."}
{"text":"I've wanted to try this little spot for a very long time and finally made it. We arrived as they were reopening for dinner, at 430p. It was uncomfortably cold in the restaurant, so we sat near the space heaters they had around some of the tables.

So you sit and look at the menu, then you have to order at the counter and your food is delivered. No a problem, except you have to pay and leave tip on your card before you eat, which would also be fine if the food and service are good. 

At the counter, there are 4 bowls of various after-dinner fennel seeds, with plastic spoons for scooping.  While we were waiting for our food, I observed an employee standing at the counter sticking her naked, uncleaned hand in, grabbing fennel seeds, eating them, then repeating...multiple times. I did not try them upon leaving...

The samosa was average, consisting of just seasoned potato, and you receive 2 in an order. I find it odd that they use plastic takeout containers for the mint and tamarind chutneys, and only give you about a Tablespoon of each for 2 larger samosa. 

The gobi manchuruan was quite tasty, but for $6, I expected more than a small side plate.

The butter chicken was terrible. It was $10.99 can consisted of a small bowl filled with an insanely thick, pasty tomato sauce with a few very small chunks of chicken. It was like eating undiluted condensed tomato basil soup. I asked about it and was told it's glue-like cause of the cashews. They took it back and brought it back out with a liquid sauce. 

There also appears to be a lot of unnecessary plastic and styrofoam use/waste.

I was just totally disappointed in this highly overpriced place and I will not return. I'm also thoroughly baffled by the 4 star rating they have. I am guessing the banquets have a higher quality food, as seen in the staged photos."}
{"text":"The food quality was excellent (5 star), but the portions were modest so I would not agree with the reviewers who characterized it as very inexpensive. 
The place was attractive, starting with the nice garden in the front. 
I really disliked having to stand at bar to order the food.  There were two waitresses and plenty of tables. Why couldn't we be waited on?  
Call me an old curmudgeon, but I really dislike being served by people with tattoos. However they were friendly and the service was timely and efficient. 
I would go back, but I wouldn't say I was a fan."}
{"text":"We ordered palak paneer and there was only 5 pieces of paneer. I was scrambling to find more paneer. The chicken dish also had very few pieces. Found the food bland...and don't plan on returning."}
{"text":"With over 50 items on an extensive menu ranging from noodles, wraps, dosas, pav bhaji, soup, parathas, Naan, biriyani and several types of curries, Caf√© Delhi is trying to be a typical Indian fast food bistro. Sadly, I can't say it succeeds. What these types of joints back india get right is consistency. Also, the cook making dosas would focus just on that and the cook handling the Indo-Chinese preparations wouldn't also be in charge of biriyani. That's how they turn around high quality despite the breadth of menu offerings. Without that kind do staffing, it's unsurprising that Caf√© Delhi doesn't get much right. Not even their masala chai. My spring dosa was missing the 'assortment of veggies', per their menu and was instead just overstuffed with a ton of potato. The paneer is chewy and the chilly paneer arrived sitting in a pool of oil. The naan is just about as good as frozen store bought naan. (Choolaah in Shadyside for me is the gold standard of paneer and naan.) The gobi manchurian is the only item remotely well prepared. Servers are way too busy to make recommendations or even eye contact for that matter. The dishes are simply plonked on the table randomly wherever they find empty space and one's left to figure out which one is whose. I wasn't too happy with cleanliness levels either. 
I've given this place a few tries and I get that Caf√© Delhi satisfies a certain type of patron. If I needed my Indian-food-fix on a regular, almost daily basis, needed variety and if I didn't know how to cook, then maybe I'd've lowered my standards. But none of that applies to me and hence the rating. I wouldn't go to or recommend Caf√© Delhi unless someone in the group really NEEDS  chaat or a dosa that night."}
{"text":"Ok. Not the biggest Indian food fan, but it was good. Naan was great. Tandoori Mixed Grill was good, though the beef was different. A chicken dish with peppers, onions & curry/spices was very tasty. Got \"#5\" heat for both dishes but this second dish seemed hotter. We could probably have gone a little higher on the heat scale. Overall, a pleasant lunch experience."}
{"text":"Our Fav Indian Place to hang out with friends. Great biryani and Chicken Lollipop. All gravies taste the same though. I wouldn't call them great but okay for accompanying with Garlic Butter Naan. We love the BYOB concept and the cute garden space they have. Perfect for summer evenings. The interiors are congested and everyone's too loud. Service OK too. They always are confused with the orders. Something wrong with their system. Honestly I don't care much when I have the beer and chicken and my friends for company. So, I am going to still recommend this place."}
{"text":"Meh.. I've experienced better - same place but last year.

This is actually for the Indian Community Center (ICC) which Cafe Delhi provides the food (buffet style) including the services.

I attended an event celebrating a Annual Hindu Festival this past Saturday and I believe this was their second year celebrating this annual event at the ICC. The place itself is really neat - used to be a church. They place is very spacious and has pretty much everything needed to host a wedding or a large event.

Unlike last year, they did not provide us with enough hors d'oeuvre - Let alone second help, it was barely enough to begin with for a group of about 100 including children. Despite requesting more of the appetizers and promising more - we gave up and thought we'll just wait for the main course.

The dinner started okay until it needed to be refilled. There was barely any meat in few of the curry (meat) items and the food items (that needed to be refilled) was not done in a timely manner. Eventually after complaining/requesting about the lack of food and the service - they filled up few of the items but by then it was too late and most of the attendees were already getting ready to leave.

Don't get me wrong - The food here is pretty good. But just good enough to feed 50% of the guest."}
{"text":"Amazing Indian food. Try the chicken lollipops for an appetizer and the Goat biryani. Will not disappoint."}
{"text":"Great food. Everything we ate was delicious. The service is terrible. They don't take your order at the table so if you want additional food, you have to go back up and order. Also, our food was brought out piece meal so it was difficult to enjoy. No seating for large groups. Recommend for takeout"}
{"text":"Little place but absolutely awesome food!  I have a big painful grin on my face from eating 7 heat takeout from here!"}
{"text":"Love this place. Grab lunch here at least once a week. Best Indian food in the South Hills.  My only minor complaint is the heat (they ask for a 1 - 10) seems fairly random. I usually as for a 5-6 heat and sometimes its hot, other times its scorching.   If you dont like hot food ask for a 1 or 2."}
{"text":"eh, it was ok.
 food was decent, not the most flavorful, but not the worst Indian I've had.  atmosphere left a lot to be desired. it was really chaotic and fast food-ish, the plates were chipped and water was tepid.  I didnt hate it, but not sure I would go back unless others really wanted to."}
{"text":"This is the best Indian restaurant in Pittsburgh.  Worth a drive if you don't live in the south hills.  You order from the counter, but the quality of the food is off the charts."}
{"text":"I was so exited to try this place because the reviews were so good. But they didn't have air conditioning so it was uncomfortably hot inside. The service was just okay. The food was mediocre. The chicken tikka and the dosas were just okay. The one redeeming factor was that they had the best veggie samosa that I've ever had. But it was definitely a miss for me."}
{"text":"So far this is the best indian food i've had in Pittsburgh. Chicken tikka masala is awesome!"}
{"text":"I stopped by again, this time on a Tuesday afternoon. They are closed on Mondays.

The food is wonderful, bold with layer upon layers of flavor.

I had the Lentil Soup with fresh pepper and parsley, a nice complement to the Chicken Chettinad.
Its boneless chicken in a thick black pepper sauce, with coconut & mild spices.
I spiced it up a little... 

The staff asks you to give a rating or 1 to 10 (with ten being the spiciest) when you order, which is genius in my opinion.

The front of house staff is very young, inexperienced and seemed a little bored being there. Please don't hold it against this little gem.

It does not have a liquor license, so its BYOB. There was another couple enjoying a bottle next to me, as the state store is only across the parking lot.

The place is clean and bright and warm and friendly and I wish them the best with this beautiful concept."}
{"text":"Delicious Indian restaurant on the outskirts of the city! Went in there with a large group (12) of people as we were celebrating someone's birthday! We ordered many items off their menu, but the standouts were:
-Gobhi Manchurian
-Mirchi bajjis
-Malai Kofta
-Lamb biryani

We need to go upto the counter and order the food, and they bring it to your table based on the number token they give you. We felt that the service is a bit slow and could definitely improve. Since we had ordered many dishes, we had 2 dishes which were missed out, and were brought at the very end! That was a bit disappointing. But the food was delicious, and would go there again when we have ample time to dine."}
{"text":"My new favorite Indian in the Pittsburgh area.  Delicious!"}
{"text":"My mother and I went there for dinner on a weekday. The food was very fresh and flavorsome. I had the tandoori chicken with naan and she had the lamb curry with naan. Definitely the best naan we ever tried! Looking forward to going back and trying some more of the menu. Price is decent."}
{"text":"Very authentic Indian place right in Carnegie. You order at the counter, and someone will deliver your food to you table. The place was packed, so I figured it must be good! 
I really don't eat Indian food, so I asked the girl at the counter what's good and she told me she doesn't eat there so she didn't know lol. I thought that was a strange response! 
We ordered the Mirchi as an appetizer and it was so delicious!!! My fiend ordered some kind of potato pancake with vegetables in it and she loved it. I had a bite and wished I would have ordered that too! I got the lamb wrap and wasn't a fan. The lamb was red. Not red as in bloody and rare, just red. It freaked me out a little bit. I've never seen bright red lamb before. 
I should also note that Cafe Delhi is BYOB and they don't charge a corking fee! 
If you like Indian food, you should check this place out."}
{"text":"Delicious food. Super tasty. Must try. I got chicken chettinad at the cashiers recommendation and it was sooooooo good. My girlfriend got chicken tikka masala and said it was the best she has ever had. My only complaint is that there is not a lot of meat compared to other Indian restaurants but with that said I was full at the end of my meal."}
{"text":"Always try to eat here when I'm nearby. Big fan of the samosa chat and dahi vada. Everything we've had has been tasty. 

Atmosphere is super casual - I think it's run by the community center next door and doesn't have the most skilled counter staff. Sometimes they forget things. But while you're seated a nice woman comes by and brings you water and takes away plates.

I have no idea what the two one-star reviewers' air freshener comments from October were about, I've never noticed such a thing there and I've been going there for years. Maybe they went to the wrong place."}
{"text":"Very tasty food.
Great quantities.
Very reasonable prices.
Good service.
Hygienic.

If they can, they should advertise and expand more!"}
{"text":"2.5 stars if I could but I'm willing to give this place the benefit of the doubt and try it again.  I ordered the samosa chaat and the malai kofta with naan while the boyfriend ordered the tandoori chicken with naan.  

The samosa chaat was decent and for Pittsburgh standards pretty good.  I did find a few tomatoes mixed in and was disappointed by the lack of authenticity.  I would try some of the other chaats since I did enjoy this appetizer - it's no Bombay chaat but it'll have to do in the 'Burgh.

On to the Malai Kofta, the best way to describe this dish is nacho cheese sauce with vegetable dumplings, two dumplings to be exact.  Yes, two measly dumplings in a sea of cheese like sauce.  Please be reminded that Malai Kofta is not meant to have any cheese so I'm not sure why it tasted so.  Needless to say, I wasn't a fan.  The vegetable dumplings were good, but I did expect to get more than 2.  The naan was also disappointing as it was apparent they weren't cooked in a clay oven and had that typical naan flavor.

Maybe I ordered the wrong dish and perhaps I should've stuck with my usual Indian dish that I order at all Indian restaurants (chicken tikka masala) but thought I'd expand my horizons.  I tried my boyfriend's tandoori chicken and while it looked very appetizing it was missing the distinctly tandoori flavor and spice.  

I don't think I'd make a special trip to come by again but if I was in the area, I'd try some of the other appetizers."}
{"text":"I don't rate Indian food highly easily having eaten authentic all the time. That said, my spouse (the chef in the family) and I are both big fans of the food here! Egg Curry, Bhindi, Dahi Poori, Mushroom Masala and salty lassi are all to die for! They even make a couple things as good as her (gasp!!). Cannot speak for the meats but the way they make everything, I'd imagine it to be super tasty as well! 

The ONLY thing I would improve would be the speed of service. They get backed up usually from ~7:15 to 9:00 so set aside an hour+ if you go during that window. I have been there 4 times already, which for me is a lot for any single establishment, much less one I'm picky about."}
{"text":"My husband hounded me for almost 3 years to try this place as I had never had Indian food.  I was leery at first but omg it's fantastic! The chicken tikka masala is amazing! My son, who is a very picky eater, absolutely loves it as well.  Everything is made to order so it's always fresh.  The girl who works the counter (Brown curly hair) is very nice and always chit chats with me as I wait on my order, so I feel her customer service is on point. They must be doing something right as they are always super busy when I go down.  I have tried 2 other places in the area (downtown Pittsburgh) and the food I've gotten at cafe Delhi is far more superior and it's even less expensive. I feel that the portions are large because I always get 2 meals out of one order, so to me that makes it an even better value."}
{"text":"good food. great prices. Complete authentic india food.
Gongura mutton, chcken fried rice."}
{"text":"This is the best Indian restaurant in Pittsburgh area.. I've tried all the Indian restaurants in pittsburgh but my vote goes to Cafe delhi... my go to place for dinner.. :) :) best food served... decent ambience..  Nd affordable. . My favorite is the paneer tikka masala :D loveee it!!"}
{"text":"Legit Indian food with a nice patio. What else do you want me to say?"}
{"text":"I've been to Cafe Delhi twice now, and both times have been impressed. Reasonably priced food that is presented in a clean and modern fashion. I'm such a fan!
Cafe Delhi is located in part of what was a church that was dormant for years. Thanks to the current owners, it has been transformed into a modern Indian restaurant alongside a convention hall. I love to frequent locally owned businesses, and I especially like it when someone invests and improves their neighborhood. There's a dozen tables inside the restaurant and an outside patio with 3-4 tables that sits in a cool, shaded courtyard. We sat out there on an 80+ degree day and it felt nice and cool.
As for the food, everything I've tried is delicious. I'm a big fan of the chicken kurma, which has a thick sauce and lots of chunks of chicken. It comes with either a side of delicate rice or their tasty naan (a flat bread), and my recommendation is to ask for both rice and naan, which is only a $1 more. Everything else I've had is fresh and delicious, and they let you choose your spice level with a 1-10 so you can decide if you're bold or a wuss.
Delicious food, great location, and almost everything on the menu is under $10. Plus, the portions are big, the place is clean, and the service is good and friendly.
Thanks for putting such a cool place in Carnegie!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite place for Indian food. I think its the best in Pittsburgh! I ve almost tried everything on their menu and i have never regreted. Their spinach paneer is the best i ve had."}
{"text":"I really did not expect much upon approach. The restaurant is located in what appears to be an abandoned Catholic church. It is now an Indian cultural center. The restaurant is off to the side of the main entrance. Looks can be deceiving. This place is excellent! I want to say one of the best Indian experiences I've had since moving to Pittsburgh. I order Aloo Gobi and was blown away by how fresh the ingredients were. The seasoning was absolutely perfect. Perfumed actually... Naan which is often a meh side was also fresh. I order the garlic and is was loaded with fresh garlic and clearly not from a box. If I HAD to come up with a complaint it would be there was not enough rice to enjoy the wonderful sauce. Next time I'll ask for more. I cannot wait to take my family here, or just come back myself. You will not be disappointed by the food here...at all. For those complaining about portion sizes...GIVE ME A BREAK!!!! The portions here are absolutely normal for any city in the USA... If you need to feed like a farm animal there are plenty of buffets to choose from. This is quality food at reasonable prices in completely normal portion sizes..."}
{"text":"My parents and I went on a cold winter Saturday to enjoy some dosas and indo Chinese food. We get there and find out that they were not cooking anything but the Indian food...which was fine. We decided to order some Indian food including biryani. We then find out that they had a 45 minute wait. Their excuse was that they had a large party in the banquet center and the chefs weren't cooking anything extra. We left immediately."}
{"text":"Great place to grab Indian food in Carnegie. Location a little hard to find but just off of the Main Street in Carnegie. Friendly and fast service. Take out or dine in setting. Order taken and paid for at the counter, orders are then brought out to you. 
I had the Aloo Gobi Masala, Somosa Chaat and Naan, all of which was perfect and I would order again. Dishes seam to come with rice or Naan but you can order a side of extra Naan. 
It does look a little divey inside. When I was here when it was cold and as other reviewers said, there are space heaters around the perimeter which was interesting, but the temperature was fine in the dining area so it didn't bother me. Prices reasonable. Can't wait to come back for more especially for take out!"}
{"text":"Absolutely won't be back. This is one of the worst Indian \"restaurants\" I have ever been to. I eat a lot of this cuisine across the country and this was an effrontery.  The navrattan korma was frozen vegetables in Velveeta cheese sauce. I'm disgusted. It was even the same color. 

These people should not be trusted to cook for you. They have air fresheners on the walls spurting chemicals at you while you eat!  I asked about it and the guy said it was to cover up the bad smells!  I asked what bad smell and didn't get an answer. It should smell like delicious Indian food not whatever was loaded in these units. 

I heard they're owned by Mintt and the cakes are made there. I'm wondering what else isn't made here."}
{"text":"Soooo happy we came here!!! I'm not usually a fan of eating Indian food at a restaurant but we came here for father's day and we not disappointed. Everything was so tasty and perfectly portioned too. If you like Indian food, you must try this place."}
{"text":"My order of malai kofta was obviously reheated in the microwave, it came out with a \"skin\"  floating on top of the sauce and the kafta were rubbery.   The flavor was decent but it was hard to get past the old rubbery texture of the kofta.   I have no desire to return.  Add it to the mix of forgettable Indian restaurants in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"Very Delicious!!  I admittedly always get the same thing, Chettinad Chicken.  Just fyi, you order at the counter and are seated afterwards.  Make sure to mention your preference regarding the spiciness of your dish.  Additionally, it is worth mentioning that they don't serve alchohol.  If you've never had Indian food Cafe Delhi is sure to provide you with a great first time."}
{"text":"Amazing Indian food. The best in the Burgh. Get a cup of mango Lissa while you're at it."}
{"text":"This place has excellent modern Indian cuisine from both south and north India.  They have a very nice selection of traditional Indian street food. They do have some modern interpretations of some of them. The  Cut Mirchi is a particular standout. The atmosphere is casual and this is a good lunch place.  Prices are very reasonable. The quality of the Indian food here is in the top 90th percentile of all Indian restaurants that I have been to."}
{"text":"I had pani puri, papri chaat and chicken lollipops.
It was pretty authentic and tasty! 
I will definitely go and try out more things."}
{"text":"I headed to this place after going through a bunch of Indian restaurants I was yet to try. They are located away from the crowd and have a really comfy and cozy interior. Their food is pretty good and the prices are reasonable too. A must try if you are in that area."}
{"text":"Amazing. Indian food and I've never had subpar service here. It's a staple for my boyfriend and I. He claims it is not spicey enough but I've tasted his paneer and it's delicious. I recommend the chicken tikka, goat curry, samosa chat, paneer wraps and malai kafta. 

I've eaten here at least six times and every time the quality and taste of the food is reliable.  I love it and will continue to frequent."}
{"text":"I've been an avid fan of another awesome Indian food restaurant in Pittsburgh but only recently having made friends who like this place, became a regular here.

The service model is different here wherein you need to order at counter and later pay for your meals there too.

What I love on the menu are the appetizers. They got Samosa chaat and Chicken 65 pretty straight of what you'll get in India. Paani puri leaves a bit to be desired though.

Now my favorite item: Ginger chicken! It's a curry based preparation which comes along with either naan or white rice. Its hot, tangy and on a scale of 10, a 7 will burn you. In a good way!

Apart from that chicken fried rice and chicken biryaani are quite decent options.

The place itself seems to be in a rather deserted area but don't let it affect your judgement.

Update: I've recently come to love their Butter Scotch Pastries. They are exceptionally good!"}
{"text":"When you go to Cafe Dehli, you are not going for the lovely ambiance, rather the best Indian food in Pittsburgh- hands down. There is no better spinach lamb or naan around! The food can take a little longer than usual to come out, but it's well worth the wait!!"}
{"text":"Visited today 7/1. Ordered 5 items
Pav bhaji - its not pav bhaji, it was pav with some aloo matar subji. Also no butter in pav or in bhaji. Please learn how to make Bhaji for pav. A 1.5 star for this dish.
Chana Bhatura - This was good. Chana could have been better but a 3.5 star for this one.
Samosa Chat - Good taste. A 3 star for this one.
Paneer Wrap - More of a salad stuffing inside a deep/swad tandoori roti. Who puts cucumber in a wrap? probably a 2 star.
Filter Cofee - Probably the best of the 5 items. A 4 star."}
{"text":"This should be 5 stars really. The food is phenomenal, but they do take time to get your food. However there are days where service is prompt and other days where it isn't, irrespective of how crowded it is.  Go figure.  Try the Chili paneer or another appetizer with \"chili\" in it and pair it with some wine.   I feel this is the best Indian food in town."}
{"text":"Really good food. I had mutton biriyani and tandoori chicken. Both were in sufficient quantities and reasonably priced.  Chicken was really soft and easy to digest in tandoori.  Will definitely be back to this place and try out their other delicacies"}
{"text":"Decent Indian restaurants continue to avoid Pittsburgh. Reading some of the good reviews about this place on yelp, we decided to try this place. The restaurant was busy which seemed like a good sign. Unfortunately, the service and the food were sub-par. Wrong dishes delivered to the table, ordered dishes forgotten... could the nightmare end soon! If you are in the Pittsburgh area and have the urge to have Indian food, please buy packaged stuff and have it at home. However, if you cant resist the urge to visit this place, dont forget to bring your own booze as it is BYOB. Something to lift your spirits up!"}
{"text":"For the last few times that I've been there, it has always been overcrowded with no arrangement to handle the crowd. Either they should put up 'Closed' sign at the door (instead of telling them rudely to shoo off) or they should increase staff. I see hardly 2-3 people running their ass off to serve customers but it goes in vain because it affects user experience. My boyfriend and I have decided never to visit this place again, rather explore newer an better Indian restaurants."}
{"text":"This places food was so good (hot, fresh, & tasty), that I wanted to cry. I could barely breathe by the time I left that I ate so much! The palak paneer & masala was delicious. I was elated the dishes were already served WITH RICE, unlike other places which force you to order separately. Personally I would still order an additional side of rice or naan because the dishes have so much sauce. Anyhow, I was very happy with the food! I'm sad that I do not live in the state in order to order frequently. Only one less star because they could definitely use a larger space. Gets packed/crowded inside very quickly."}
{"text":"For the last few times that I've been there, it has always been overcrowded with no arrangement to handle the crowd, & the staff goofing up with our order. So we decided to pick up our order & eat at home as we absolutely love their chicken lollipop because its tastes exactly like the one's you get in indo-chinese fast food joints in mumbai.
I placed the order at 8pm and they said my order would be ready in 20mins.and after 20mins my order was not ready & the staff kept me waiting for more 30mins.I kept on asking the staff about my order they just ignored and did not reply.After a while i got furious & told them i  wanted my money back as i cannot wait any longer they refused to refund me and they were rude, the manager did not care he kept on telling me to wait 2minutes every time i asked him about my order.After waiting for 30mins i finally got my order.
We were so disappointed with their poor service.But we thought the nightmare is over & we can enjoy the food,but we were wrong.we ordered butter chicken & chicken lollipop,the butter chicken was disgusting there was 5pcs of small chicken cubes with creamy sauce with no flavour tasted nothing like butter chicken.The chicken lollipop was cold & i asked them to give me a side of garlic sauce which they did not.I felt cheated & was so angry after the experience i had.
I will never go back to this restaurant.& would not recommend this place to anybody.
 My husband and I have decided never to visit this place again, rather explore newer an better Indian restaurants."}
{"text":"Often times I find myself here before they open, waiting in my car to be the first person to order. The staff has always been kind and generous; a few times when I place a take out order, they offer a complimentary pop or chai tea...what a nice touch!

There are so many good things to try, I don't know where to start. I once found myself ordering 6 items for just my husband and myself...oops!! The samosa is always a good choice. Their pakoras are even better. I like to have the bhel puri as an afternoon snack. The masala dosa is a family favorite too. Their Pav Bhaji is second only to my mother-in-laws. Okay, one more...the Chana bhatura is always fun, but definitely order it if you're dining in. Now you know all of the dishes I order all the time, try them for yourself!"}
{"text":"Definitely one of the best indian restaurants (in terms of food only) across the US. Every dish I have ordered here has been top notch. The biryani is the only dish I wouldn't really recommend but everything else on the menu is definitely worth trying. Cons are that the service and kitchen is very mismanaged, so wait times can be horrible at times, but the food is worth the wait."}
{"text":"We have been going to Caf√© Delhi the last six months.. every two weeks on average.. Like many other cafes, it appears to have a short half-life.. We loved the type and quality of food for the first few months... However, I reluctantly will remove my recommendation..

Service has deteriorated significantly over the last 2 months or so.. No one thing, but each of our last 5-6 visits have not been pleasant.. A manager that does not care, messed up food orders, long waits, a staff that appears immune to customer requests.. The quality of food has gone down a bit.. but is still quite good.. 
However, if I want good South Indian food, I will now go to Udipi Cafe.. If I want good non-veg food, Tamarind is a good bet,,,,"}
{"text":"Had my doubts about this place because it looks like a slightly sketchy neighborhood but boy, was I wrong! Got here around lunch time on a Saturday (~noon) and it was very slow... Not sure if this place is usually slow or if it's bc it's a holiday weekend. 

Customer service up to par, which is very important to me. The person who took my order was very pleasant. He told me to order my entree with naan, and hooked me up with a bowl of rice. 

Ordered: 
-Chicken tikka masala: it came in a smaller bowl than I anticipated but it was actually just the right amount with my sides of naan and rice. I felt like there was a lot more sauce than chicken... And probably could've been better with more... But no complaints. 
-Mango Lissa: came in a tiny cup. Was hoping it'd be made to order / fresh but he pulled it out pre made from the display. It was still good but wish it was colder. 
-Tandoori chicken: got 4 pieces of chicken and should be more than enough for 1 person. It was flavorful and overall, no complaints. 

They have spice levels 1-10 (mild to hot). The 8 had a kick but I didn't think it was as spicy as an 8 should be. It was actually pretty close to the level 5 spice. 

They have indoor and outdoor seating. Outdoor seating can be under a roof, or completely out in the open.

{"text":"I've never understood how my Indian friend's stay skinny when their food is so delicious!  My wife and I are Indian restaurant aficionados and we've journeyed to almost every one in the Pittsburgh area.  Cafe Delhi is among the best, and easily has the best prices and the fastest friendliest service of any of them.  Almost every dish on the menu is just $4-$8, so you can easily get a few things to try.  You'll want to, because it's too hard to choose between the huge number of options.

The dishes have their traditional Indian names, with English descriptions underneath, which I found very helpful.  They offer to spice everything as you request from 1-10 and we all found their spice levels to be perfect, very full flavored but never overwhelming.  Despite the low prices, the portion sizes are generous, and we ended up taking home enough leftovers for a future Indian feast!

The only negative is that the restaurant is fairly unassuming, with a simple awning to mark the front, and little in the way of decoration or atmosphere inside.  That said, it's clean, well maintained, and the waiters were responsible and helpful.  Cafe Delhi believes, as I do, that nothing should distract away from food as the center of the dining experience.

Get ready for a diverse offering of fantastic dishes, fast service, generous portions and an unbelievable value.  I do not throw 5 star ratings around lightly, but Cafe Delhi has absolutely earned the highest possible rating.  I'm tempted to move next door, just so I can eat there every day!"}
{"text":"I have eaten food from this establishment twice in the last two weeks, and though the flavors of Indian food are represented well, the meat has been overcooked and dry. 
The restaurant service was adequate and friendly, but there is a lot left to be done here."}
{"text":"Fantastic Indian food, tucked away in a very unassuming part of Carnegie.  I loved the selection of different types of chats, kati rolls, and appetizers.  I could make a meal on that alone!  My family and I came here and ordered quite a few things for lunch.  Standouts were the cut mirchi, Gobhi Manchurian, fried rice, and pani puri.  I ordered the chicken tikka masala for my entree, and while it was good I felt it was extremely creamy.  I was hoping of more of a tomato based taste.  I think it would have tasted a lot better without the cream, or at least less of it.  My family and I stuffed ourselves to the bone, and ended up not eating dinner that night at all.  I will definitely be back, and might even consider them to cater an event.  Worth the trip to Carnegie!"}
{"text":"Small establishment. Food is great. However, not your typical restaurant set-up. You order at the front desk and pay up front and then they serve you when it's ready. You can sit anywhere, seat yourself atmosphere. We had the mixed grill with rice. We also ordered some chicken noodles and garlic naan.  We will be back!"}
{"text":"The biryani is awesome and I liked the Vada too. Nice place to sit and eat"}
{"text":"The food is awesome. Really like the Indo-Chinese options like Hakka noodles. Also love pani puri. Great neighborhood  restaurant."}
{"text":"I'm one picky ass snobby eater.  So, it warms me when I proclaim the following:  This place, along with Shalimar in San Francisco are the two best Indo-Pak Restaurants in the USA.  Dont waste your time with the plethora of mediocre Indian restaurants found all over the country.  
Spartans! Ready your dinner and eat hearty... For tonight, we dine in heaven!"}
{"text":"I was here for dinner with my friends. We placed order for papadi chat, chicken drumsticks, dahi puri( not sure if the name is completey correct, it is panipuri with dahi in it) and salt lassi. 

Both papdi chat and panipuri are good. My friends enjoyed it. However, I was disappointed both with the lassi and chicken drumsticks taste. Lassi had too much of masala flavor. I wish I had gone for mango lassi instead. Chicken drumsticks which is my favorite item on the menu was a disappointment for the first time. It was over fried, oily (I could see oil dripping off the piece) and bland."}
