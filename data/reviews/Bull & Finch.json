{"text":"Came in for lunch recently, hadn't really been to this pub except for a few pints of beer a few years back, and unfortunately won't be returning for eating. I ordered a Caesar chicken salad being not ver hungry, and the other guys ordered the salmon with rice pilaf, and a beef dip. The Caesar was oily and bland tasting, and chicken dry. I could tell the salmon was overbooked, and the beef dip was ...well, a standard run of the mill beef dip. This pub really needs to fire this noon time chef...really bad food for too much money...$12,95 for a salad...gimme a break  I don't recommend going there for anything except drinks."}
{"text":"I've tried the Bull & Finch a few times. The first time, we went for dinner. They had $3.99 Paralyzers on special, so I relived my high school days and enjoyed one of those. We had fries and salt & pepper wings. The fries were alright, but the wings were overcooked. They barely had any meat on them, and were extremely dry. Big disappointment. Also, it took forever for a server to come over. We were about to put our coats on and leave, but the bartender came over and got our drink order, apologizing for the wait. He was very nice, but it was still a pain to wait nearly 15 minutes for someone to acknowledge us in a near-empty bar. 

The second time, I came with my mom for their \"$4.99 Breakfast\" (breakfast/brunch is our jam). I put this in quotes because they advertise this price on the side of the building. But, when we received the menus, we noticed that the price was actually $6.95. It's not a big deal, but just false advertising on their part which could drive away customers. I had a Caesar, and it was well made. Then, I decided on the $6.95 breakfast, and my mom got the 'Scrambler'. Well, the eggs for her 'Scrambler' were clearly from a package, as they tasted horrible and quite fake. My breakfast was alright, but I was put off by the orange slice for garnish on my plate that was on the verge of going bad.

I give two stars because at least they can make a good Paralyzer and Caesar. But, the food leaves a lot to be desired."}
{"text":"There are better choices close at hand.

We have been a few times over the past year for drinks and dinner.  It has never been great, but our recent trip there was horrible.  The \"pizza flatbread\" was awful, greasy and did not get eaten.  The cheeseburger sliders were passable, but nothing to look forward to.  

The pub was recently renovated on the past 12-18 months and is actually quite nice.  The food undermines the effort.  Do yourself a favour and look elsewhere, especially if you are looking to have a bite."}
{"text":"There are times when it's nice only having to drive 5 minutes for a pint and some pub food, so when I found out about this place being so close we decided to go over and try it out! 

I would say it was an ok experience. I was disappointed with the beer selection since it lacked what other establishments seem to have much more of. (Variety of local and import)

Our server was nice but all business and I noticed that a lot of the staff seemed to be that way.

We ordered the Spinach Dip and the Cabo Wabo Soft Tacos. The Spinach dip wasn't to my liking, it had about a cup of shredded cheese on top that was hardly melted in and this made it really hard to dip/scoop.... the word overkill comes to mind. The soft tacos were nice though; they had a good flavour and were a good sharing size.

While there we were invited to play a game of \"name that tune\" It was entertaining until we noticed the table beside us (our competitors) were using the app Shazam to get all the answers correct... as the night grew on another table started to get more vocal (fueled by alcohol) and started to shout out answers when it wasn't their turn and thus a rougher crowd started to arise. 

I don't think we'll be rushing to head back in the future..."}
{"text":"This is a really solid pub joint! The food is always hearty and you get great value. Our favourite part is their service. Everyone there is approachable, friendly and fast. My girlfriend and I often go on week nights when we don't want to cook, we haven't been disappointed yet. 
The bar is clean, TV's are everywhere and this is for sure our favourite local spot."}
{"text":"Let's play lyrical name that tune, can you guess the following song made famous by the 1980's film Karate Kid?

\"I am a man who will fight for your honor 
I'll be the hero you're dreaming of 
We'll live forever 
Knowing together that we 
Did it all for the glory of love\"

If you guessed \"Glory of Love\" by Peter Cetera, then you are correct! If you happen to be the people who ran \"name that tune\" and still got it correct, you %*$& OWE US POINTS Or perhaps you were just gunning for the table of freshly turned 18 year olds, bracing them for the rough world of adulthood they're ushering into.

Aside from our table getting stiffed over name that tune, The old Bull N' Finch has always been a good pub choice when it comes to last minute places to drink at, or when you want to meet up with old friends/co-workers. They have a satisfying menu, great nacho's and pasta from what I can remember. They also have a wings night, which I believe runs every tuesday night. Interesting note about their wings is that they have an extremely hot flavour in which you have to sign a waiver for. I think I might have tried it in a past belligerent state, but I'm alive and kicking I'm sure it wasn't that bad."}
{"text":"Yet again, I find myself at the bull. Argued with our server over what proper football was and making the noises come out of the speakers. Locked eyes with the people who wanted to watch basketball. I'm pretty sure we could come to an agreement but we're to lazy to talk to each other. The manager intervened and came up with a solution. 
The beers were cold, the hash browns burnt my mouth. I don't know the trauma I'll have later down the road but I'll find a way to live my life like a normal person. Also, my water was served with ice. 
My final thoughts of the place, aside from being confused where the one newspaper showed up from, I'd recommend coming here. The server Kaytlan was courteous and was well informed on game of thrones. Would come again. 10/10"}
{"text":"Went during NHL playoffs and was surprised that there were no hockey games on any of the tvs. Asking for a channel change seemed to irritate the server, as well. 

Food was decent and arrived quickly. Pizza was ok, yam fries were very good! Everything was reasonably priced, including high balls. 

Even though the food came in a timely manner, the service was quite slow -and it wasn't even busy. Our waitress was not attentive at all and was actually quite rude right off the get go...in fact the entire wait staff that night seemed to be quite miserable. We even overheard another table discussing whether or not they should just get up and leave. 

Overall, the service wasn't good enough to outweigh the food, which was alright."}
{"text":"I'm really impressed by the food here. It's bar food but better. And not overpriced. I come here for lunch often since my office is close by. The same server  (a young guy with a beard) is usually working and he's really good at his job"}
{"text":"The Bull and Finch is open. Was something else for a while but is back with a nicer interior. They have decent specials and not crowded on a Saturday night. Maybe because Yelp says they're Closed. Can't even check in because its flagged as closed. Saturday specials we had were tasty. Steak and shrimp. And pork cutlets (good size portion and crispy )"}
{"text":"The Bull & Finch has always struck me as a generic Calgary pub. A decent place with a fun atmosphere to watch a game while munching on typical pub fare. The service has always been friendly at this location and the food is alright. I personally prefer the Elbow Dr location as it's closer to home, more quaint, and actually the first bar I went to when I turned 18 all those years ago.

{"text":"The Bull and Finch in South Calgary is the place we always stop after an ultimate frisbee game at the Calgary Rugby Union.  It used to be because it was the closest pub to where we were.  The team was too hungry to go any further.   We still head there for the same reason, but we're enticed to head to the other two Bull & Finch locations when we're close because this year they're giving out free nachos to teams of 6 or more.  

The service has never been bad, I wouldn't give it an A+ either, but I've been often enough to have tried more than one or two items on the menu.  The burgers are tasty and the beer is always cold.  No complaints here."}
{"text":"Aah, a classic hang-out location! I have fond memories of coming here with a couple of my music teacher friends after they finished work and shooting the breeze, enjoying a pint of Canadian and having the philly cheesesteak, an absolutely beastly sandwich that probably weighed three pounds in cheese alone, and required three hands to eat. It is a filling sandwich that will have you regretting every moment, but it's worth it! The wings are decent too."}
{"text":"Being new to town, someone suggested to meet here since it's close to their place. I was underwhelmed by both the service and the food. Things started not so badly, a very attractive and friendly waitress took my original order, before my friend showed up.  Once my friend did walk in (my friend is a lady) there was all of a sudden a change in waitresses, with no word about it. This waitress was incredibly unpleasant, not even acknowledging a \"thank you\" when bringing me food or drinks. And you she smelled of disgusting cigarette odour as well, which is incredibly appetizing as you're about to dig into your food.

In all, it's not the worst place I've been, but I won't go out of my way to show up there again."}
{"text":"Well, after living in Bridlewood for 3 years, I figured its past time I check out the Bull and Finch. Craving a burger, and hoping for some meaty goodness I went in with a nice apatite.

As I came in the doors I found it to be nice and dim inside (my kind of place). It wasn't busy so I found a table. Along the South Wall they have a couple tables with leather living room style chairs, so I picked one of those. As i was taking off my jacket, the waitress was putting down a menu and asking what i would like to drink, it was Coke no ice today as I came to try a burger and wasn't in the mood for a beer. The said Coke was at my table within about 90 seconds and my order was quickly placed. 

Inside the pub, they have some standard fare, a section for VLT's and TV's showing some sports. One thing of note is there seems to be plenty of booths throughout the joint.

My burger came within about 12 minutes and arrived with the Caesar Salad as I try and avoid Fries for the most part. The salad isn't a home made dressing, however it doesn't seem to be the cheap kind (Kraft) so it meets my approval (It's a nice garlicy dressing). The burger itself is quite nice, with a hand made patty (No preformed patties here!) with a sweet mayo based sauce on it, there's also a decent amount of toppings on it. 

After a few bites of my burger and salad and my Coke was a gulp away from empty! Enter the waitress with a fresh beverage, before the glass was empty (My favorite way of telling how good the wait staff is is if my glass goes empty and for how long).

Overall I was pretty happy with my visit to the Bull & Finch and I'm looking forward to adding it to the places I like to eat. Price wise, The burger was a great value ($12.99 for the Bacon Cheese variety) although I would like to see a little more salad come with it. As they say in the movies \"I'll be back!\""}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite neighborhood  pubs!  The concept is open and the decor is nice. The food is great ever thing is made in house even the hamburger patties, unlike most pubs that only have frozen food. They also have drink and food specials every day. ( Friday is steak and lobster Saturday steak in shrimp). The staff is always friendly and inviting! All in all great place to meet up with friends for food and a cold beer after a long week of work!!"}
{"text":"Definitely had a blast here for Erick D's bday bash. (by the way Happy Bday E-ROCK!)...

The Bull has your typically pub setup.  Last night however had the added bonus of the classic pub trivia game \"Name That Tune\" with none other than DJ Tapeworm on the ones and twos (the word \"tapeworm\" still gives me the willies)....with a couple of random shots, a schooner and some good pals on top it was a fun filled evening....

The crowd was mixed with a slight tilt towards a younger demographic but age is only a number when tables are going head to head over who sung \"Glory Of Love\". (side note: Team Ramrod gets picked as a team name every weekend so go for an original next time your in)

I mean I don't know what else to say about the Bull other than:

-Booze is booze

-theres a pool table

-plenty of booths

-lively atmosphere

- I remember the waitresses face so she must have been doing a good job

I dunno, I may have missed the negatives about this place but when you have a great group of people to chat and have fun with I could care less! (SHOUT OUT to the Powerfriends!)

PEACE!"}
{"text":"I go here ever once and awhile. Its a good time ( when there is a younger crowd) The past couple times ( ever since Renos) i have been there, its \"older\" people there. The girls that work there are ALWATS wonderful. Service is good. I like going there."}
{"text":"We live less than 5 minutes from here, and we've come a number of times. Always had pretty good service. The decor is typical to a pub/bar. The drinks are good; we were there near closing time one night and my boyfriend asked for an Irish Coffee, the bartender made him a fresh pot just for his one drink. The food is also good, though maybe not very memorable. The last time we went was on \"wing\" day and it was packed due to a game. The wings tasted dried out to me, and not much meat on the bones, for 35 cents a piece. You can get much better wings for the same price from Buffalo Wild Wings. However, our waitress accidentally dropped her drink tray on me and as I was soaked, she took half off our meal, which was nice. Overall, good service, good atmosphere, nice that it's close, but food is typical to a pub."}
