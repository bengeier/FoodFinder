{"text":"Selma's is really good, not BBQ pit-masters great, but very good for Pittsburgh. The pulled pork is fantastic. I highly recommend the Big Pig Wrangler (add a hot sausage to the pulled pork sandwich)! I see other reviews looking for BBQ perfection and this isn't it. But if you're craving some BBQ and living or visiting here in Pittsburgh, this place will do the trick."}
{"text":"Ribs and sauces were dynamite! Sides were eh. Fries and sweet potato fries were not good."}
{"text":"Wish this place was closer! We were bummed to have to miss out on the ribs and the pulled chicken (they warned us online re first come, first served!), but aside from the mushy green beans, everything we got (pulled pork, brisket, turkey, catfish, all sorts of sides) was delish."}
{"text":"I have visited this place on 3 seperate occasions and have been left wanting each time. Either it's poor service, cold food, wrong order or high prices, this place can't get it right...

I WANT to like it but they keep proving me wrong. The food isn't bad (except the pulled pork=poor) but definitely needs help to be top notch! Price point is way high as you can't get out under $15.00...

This would be a great neighborhood place, but they have work to do."}
{"text":"I'm a southern girl and there are few things that I enjoy more than BBQ so I was hopeful as I drive to Selma's based on reading Yelp reviews. 
My friend and I chuckled as we pulled in the parking lot because we were definitely over-dressed. The building looks like an old fast food restaurant and the decor is non-existent.  Stark walls, plain tables, and a grimy bathroom ....   But what Thelma's lacks in charm, it makes up in flavor. 
The food was delicious.  I had the beef brisket, Mac & cheese, and hush puppies. My friend had a rack of ribs, baked beans, and hush puppies.  We both enjoyed experimenting with the 6 different sauces available at our table. 
We will definitely return."}
{"text":"Wide variety of meats and sauces. Should please everyone, except maybe vegetarians. I had the catfish with delicious homemade tarter sauce. Husband had a platter with 3 small sandwiches. So much food he couldn't finish it, even though he wanted to! Potato salad was very good, Mac and cheese was ok but not the best."}
{"text":"Being from the south - particularly Texas, Mississippi, and Arkansas - I feel that I'm a pretty good judge of good barbeque.  I was very excited to hear about this restaurant, and just tried it last night.  A large group of us went, and all were pleased with the food, and the service.  The pulled pork was great, and the fried catfish was really good.  As stated on their website, they use only US farm-raised catfish, not catfish from overseas (which has been in the news recently for possible contaminant issues), and it was divine.

Our group really went wild over the hush puppies - honestly, some of the best I've had.  The sides were all good (especially the green beans) but I was disappointed to hear that they were out of greens.  That would have been the perfect complement to our sampler platter!  I wasn't crazy about the potato salad, but admittedly I am picky when it comes to that.  The macaroni and cheese? Amazing.

Great service; you order at the front.  Food took a little while, as it should - it was well worth the wait!  There are six varieties of BBQ sauces from which to chose; there is a handy 'guide' at each table describing each one.  Loved the variety, and honestly, all tasted great!

Very friendly service; nothing fancy inside, but very very clean.  Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Food is pretty good but the lady working the counter was terrible. No smile, no eye contact and seemed very annoyed to be there. I wonder if the owner knows."}
{"text":"I am stuck in the middle with this spot.  I've had it a few times and half the times I was left with a bad taste in my mouth.  Definite'y loved it the first time, ribs were tender and falling off the bone, the corn muffins were soft as can be, and the side options were delicious.  After that first time it seems to have gone hill which definitely upset me.  Out of the 11 total times I've come here for food I'd say a good 5 I had encountered a bad experience but am always staying positive that something changes for the better.  For the record I've always arrived around thee same time each time which was around 6pm."}
{"text":"Good Barbecue in Moon Township?  I think it has arrived with Selma's Texas Barbecue.  I will admit at first I thought it was a chain, especially looking at the menu and graphic design work. When we ordered food and dug in I was sure these guys were a chain since everything we tasted was excellent!  

Let me say I am not a fan of Smokey Bones.  I find their barbecue I auninspired and a bit dry.  At Selma's you will not e disappointed.  We had the Trailblazer Sampler on our first visit and for $17.99 it was enough food for three of us. The pulled pork was succulent, the pork ribs fell off the bone, the brisket was some of the best I ever had, the turkey had a great smoked flavor but was just a bit dry.

Selma's has a great selection of sauces to pour over your meats but quite frankly it is unnecessary with the quality.   On another visit I had their   fried catfish.  It was OK.  I thought the fish was not very fresh and the breading a bit bland.  

The sides are great.  I especially enjoyed the baked beans that I will say are some of the best I have ever had.  The beans have some pulled pork in the mix and great seasoning.   The Coleslaw is tasty but a tad dry.

Overall Selma's is an excellent experience and highly recommended!"}
{"text":"I'm a big BBQ fan and have tried virtually every place within a 50 mile radius of Pittsburgh (and many further out including Texas and Memphis), but unfortunately Selma's isn't one that I'll want to go back to. As you can see on their webpage, they close their meats in a smoker with the meats dripping directly on the fire which creates clouds of sooty black smoke, not wood smoke. Thus the chicken and ribs have a greasy sooty black coating instead of the reddish brown smoked look that I crave. Among the many better choices are Pittsburgh BBQ company on Banksville, Clems on Rt 22 or State College. Smokin Memphis BBQ in Brighton Heights was quite good as well but they've been closed for months with a note in the window about a hospital emergency. If you don't mind driving a couple hours for good BBQ, I think Old Carolina BBQ in Cleveland is even better than anything you can find in the burgh. They're a regular feature at the Steelers season opener \"Ribfest\" if you don't mind waiting."}
{"text":"As our hotel shuttle turned on the street to take us to our destination, my husband and I spotted this restaurant. We took the shuttle to this location and we were thrilled with our meals. My husband had the ribs and I had the brisket. We loved experimenting with the sauces too. The ribs were excellent and the brisket was very tender. The French fries reminded us of carnival fries so we put vinegar on them. We had the coleslaw, Mac and cheese, and the collard greens. The Mac and Cheese was a little bland but everything else was top notched. Their sweet tea really hits the spot with everything. If we lived in this area we would be eating there at least once a week."}
{"text":"Just like BBQ place should be. The standard choices, standard sides, with a bunch of sauces at the table. Prices are reasonable (Tue lunch special of pulled pork, 1 side and drink for $5 probably brings them in by the droves) and service was fast and friendly."}
{"text":"This is a 3 star review with a promise for me and my family to try this place again!

In the restaurant's defense, we arrived about 2 hours before closing on a Saturday night.  Still, the food we had was good.  We intentionally ordered a few different things to get a feel for what Selma's has to offer.  

I ordered: 
- The 2 meat combo - I picked beef brisket and ribs
- It comes with 2 sides - I picked the mac and cheese and potato salad

My wife ordered:
- The pulled pork with cole slaw.  
- It comes with 2 sides - she picked the side salad and mac and cheese

The ribs were good.  Decently juicy and tender.  The brisket was a little dry.  The potato salad was just meh.  The mac and cheese went to the kids.  It also came with a corn bread muffin which was just average.

My wife's pulled pork dish was also good.  Not great.  There is a huge selection of BBQ sauces on the table.  It adds a little something to the meal.  Something different and unexpected.

All in all - we were satisfied and got out of there for about $21 after a $5 Val Pak coupon.  We're going to try this place for lunch on the weekends to see if there is a little improvement in the offerings.  For a first impression of the place, not bad!"}
{"text":"I like reading reviews, but rarely write them...but after my first visit at Selma's, I must say that this is NOT the place for BBQ! For those of you who said it was the best you've ever had.... liar liar pants on fire! I've been know to make some of the best BBQ, smoked low and slow and worth the 5 hrs it takes to make it right. At Selma's, apparently from the gray cast that their ribs had, it was obvious that they probably boiled the ribs first, then stuck them in the oven to finish them off. The ribs  had no smoke flavor whatsoever, no seasoning whatsoever, and were tough. Thank God for the array of sauces to cover up that BS, at least the sauces had flavor! The collard greens were obviously from a can and tasted just like metal, not even an attempt to season them. The mac & cheese had that reheated microwave texture to it, just not good. The corn bread muffin....well, lets just say that it tastes the way that your child's Playdough smells, it was heavy and cold. The ONLY thing that I liked was the catfish sandwich! The cornmeal breading was crispy and the catfish taste was clean. When it comes to ribs, do yourself a favor and MAKE YOUR OWN!!!!!"}
{"text":"I'll preface this by saying I am a bit of a BBQ snob after frequenting some of the best places in the wrold in Memphis and the San Antonio area. 

Overall Selma's is pretty good. Probably the best you can do in Pittsburgh. The weak link here are the ribs. Just don't measure up. Everything else is well done and it's nice they don't drown everything in sauce and let the meat stand on it's on. Nothing mind blowing, just solid and consistent. 

I dine there frequently and will continue to do so....enjoy."}
{"text":"Came highly recommended but we were very disappointed. The meat was deliciouis but luke warm and the sides were just OK. Our silverware was dirty and we had to go back several times before we got clean ware. Sauce bottles were partially clogged and greasy to touch. We won't be going back!"}
{"text":"Eaten here twice and been impressed both times. The food is great, the staff is great and the sauces, by and large, are fantastic.  

I'm a barbeque snob and love this place, I work at a local business and will be eating here at least once a week. Fantastic"}
{"text":"Texas, Memphis, Carolina, Kansas all represented! Nice to see a USA BBQ joint representing the varieties in America. Bonus: gives Military Discount."}
{"text":"As a native Texan and someone who has been around true Texas BBQ plus the World Championship BBQ Cookoff for decades, let me tell you, Selma's isn't it. I had the pulled pork sandwich and hubby had the combination plate. My pork was OK but tasted like it was cooked in the crockpot.  Hubby's brisket and sausage were both way overcooked. There is no way this stuff was cooked over a hickory fire. There was no sign of a smoke ring in the brisket and also no wood burning fire smell.  If they had a hickory wood fire going on the premises, trust me you would be able to smell it for miles. The sauces were anything but authentic as well.  Selma's is probably fine for a quick lunch or snack but honestly, Smokey Bones has this place beat by a mile, with a better atmostphere as well as prices."}
{"text":"I walked in and it smelled just like the Feed Store BBQ place that I worked at in high school.  Wow, brought back memories!

Being from Texas, BBQ has to be good -- this is the real thing and I was impressed!  I had the pulled brisket sandwich with fries.  The brisket reminded of my Dad's brisket!  That good!  :)  The fries were yummy and just like Mom use to make (Hi, Mom!)   The sauce that I tried was good (the original) but I would have preferred it a bit thicker.  My husband got the pulled pork sandwich with coleslaw.  He liked it.  Just for the record -- I NEVER remember Texas BBQ having coleslaw on it.  I think this is a Missouri thing, but it's an option on the sandwich.   

I will definitely go back and I hope that they get enough business.  Very low key and clean.  Just the way a 'Texas' BBQ place should be!

If you are reading this and you live in the Robinson Township area and you like BBQ -- check it out!"}
{"text":"I'm not quite understanding the lower star reviews.. I've never had anything but amazing BBQ, the trail boss sampler I believe is what my boyfriend, and I normally share. 
Best BBQ in Pittsburgh by far"}
{"text":"I have been in here a couple separate times.
The food is always decent  but never better than average. The pulled pork is quite dry as well as the chicken. 

The worst part of the experience was the man who helped my Jason was pretty rude. He seemed agitated and unhappy to be there.

If you want mediocre bbq that is overpriced this is your place."}
{"text":"I am sitting in the parking lot writing this review. Its a hole in the wall BBQ joint near an airport, what can go wrong?! Nothing! It was amazing. I had the pulled pork dinner which came dry (no sauce) giving me the option to choose between 6 different sauces on the table. Not much one for risk, I went with the original and it was damn good. Cheap, quick, delicious. What more could you ask for? I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Out and about in Moon Township and had to stop at one of my favorite bbq restaurants.  If you have never been to Selmas .. you are missing out!!  Located on University Blvd just across from Arbys/Sheetz.. easy in and out.    Yesterday I was in the mood for their chicken..  its so delicious.   I got a chicken sandwich and two sides - fries and cole slaw. . came to $10.00 not bad.   There are numerous bbq sauces that would please any bbq fan but my favorite is the \"Texas  Cowboy\". Its sweet and spicy.   

The menu has so many options it tough to choose...  I have been a long time fan so  I have tried almost everything.  The mac and cheese is a must!!!   Selmas also caters and have used them in the past for many work events and always a huge hit.   Selmas is no doubt one of the most unique restraunts in the area and always a delicious and fresh meal!!"}
{"text":"Really wanted to this to be good - it was not even adequate.  Pulled pork was NOT BBQ, roast pork maybe, but definitely not BBQ.  Flaccid, lacking any smoke or hardwood character and simply blah.  I've had better pulled pork at a school cafeteria.  I can't speak to the brisket or ribs and don't plan to ever be able to do so.

The sauces on the table were mediocre at best.  The Texas sauce was a serviceable soup of chili powder (typical TX style, all chili powder), the KC was a joke (I lived there for 5 years, they would laugh this sauce out of town) and the rest were watered down commercial pretenders.

I'll try to look past the fact that I spent the next day in bed with a case of food-bourne illness that is very likely a result of my lunch at Selma's.  Hey, it happens to every restaurant occasionally...not worth it for this sorry excuse for BBQ.

Stay away!"}
{"text":"Decent BBQ. Call before you go as they don't honor the hours they post on their website. I went there Oct 1st at 5:15 and the doors were locked(website says open until 6pm) This was the 2nd time this happened to me."}
{"text":"In town for a business meeting at Dick's Sporting Goods, a few locals joked about coming here. \"It's one of the few places we know where you can get porn, child care, do laundry and eat decent BBQ in one parking lot,\" they told me.

I opted to stick with the BBQ and for Pittsburgh, it's not bad. If you've never been here, don't expect an upbeat, fun atmosphere like Smokey Bones. This location is in need of a major makeover. It's rundown, old and while the BBQ is fair the atmosphere is bland, at best. The service is lackluster, too. The cashier taking our order struggled to even smile, say hi or thank you. 

What you can count on is large portions and plenty of BBQ sauce to try. There's a handful of sauces that aim at replicating several styles, including Western and Eastern North Carolina, Kansas City, Texas and Memphis. They are all fair. None will win any awards, but in Western PA, they do fine. 

As for the food, it's average BBQ. I'll put it this way; you aren't going to find anything to complain about, but nothing to rave about, either, although the turkey is pretty good. If you enjoy BBQ you'll be content here and they do have sweet tea, lemonade, etc, so you can feel like you're in the South. 

When it comes to meats there's plenty to try. Between two of us, we tried the brisket, pulled pork, pulled chicken and smoked turkey, and one rib per the YELP offer. While the meats were a bit dry, they tasted fine with the sauce. My friends work less than a mile from here and do, sadly, complain about consistency. The ribs are wonderful one week and terrible the next they tell me. 

On the other that, they do offer a smorgasbord of sides and cornbread. Their fries are hand-cut and definitely above average, the okra wasn't greasy in any way, which is a huge plus, and the apple sauce tasted like well, apple sauce."}
{"text":"Came here because of a buy-one dinner plate, get -one free in the enjoyment book. Got 2 Two meat platters, saving 17.99.  Got the pulled pork, brisket, pulled chicken, and Carolina pork (pulled pork with some kind of seasoning and coleslaw on top).  Decent servings and all were very good, especially the brisket and pulled chicken, which seemed to be all white meat.  All the sides were good, we got hush puppies, french fries, and mac & cheese.  
Service is not the best, the young girls behind the counter seem to forget things with a lot of orders around us, but they were very nice, and offered a 15% off coupon and/or extra food to those orders.  
It's a counter service establishment, you get your own silverware and fill your own drinks.  There were some snobs around us who seemed to be very offended by the fact that they had to get up for boxes!
They have specials every day, Mondays it's a percentage off rib dinners: a full slab, (12 bones average) with 2 sides and cornbread is $17.99. 
It's not the best barbecue I've ever had, but I think it's way better than anything you'll make at home!!!"}
{"text":"This was truly a bright spot in an otherwise dismal trip to Pennsylvania. How I ended up in this little town isnt important. What is important is that you try it for lunch or dinner if traveling through PA and find yourself nearby. Dont let the simple, unassuming store front deter you. Right off Hwy 376, this place is well worth the stop. 

I had the brisket sandwich with a side of mac and cheese (or crack and cheese as the extremely pleasant, very personable young girl put it that works the register). My friend had the pulled chicken with Alabama white bbq sauce. I tried a bite of his sandwich and it was quite good but I liked mine better. First off, they dont put sauce on the meat which I always appreciate. They have a handful of sauces to pick from (most of which I tried and liked) that come on the side for you to distribute. The brisket didnt have the smokiness they advertise but had a nice flavor and very tender. The mac and cheese could use a little salt but was also very good! They make their own lemonade and brew their own sweet tea. I'm sure the tea is good but I had the lemonade which was just the right amount of sweet and tart. 

PRIMANTI BROS is right down the road on this exit off Hwy 376 too. Skip it unless you want to say you tried an iconic Pitt sandwich and it was awful. Selmas is WAY better! I rarely am traveling through Pennsylvania but if I ever am near, I will gladly give this small bbq joint my business once again."}
{"text":"Thank you Pittsburgh, we have a worthy BBQ place. 
It's on the old fashioned side, but that's how I believe it should be. 

Selma's is real Texas style but they also have Memphis style rubs and vinegar sauces which are delicious.  

When I'm out in this direction, it's difficult for me not to turn in here to eat."}
{"text":"Was looking for some good Bar b que, didn't find it here. Ordered the half slab took 2 bites of very fatty ribs. No taste no seasoning on the ribs. Was like no ribs I ever had before. It was like they were baked. Not going back."}
{"text":"The brisket at this place was pretty good but not amazing! The green beans with bacon were overcooked and really mushy. The baked mac & cheese was average.

Overall the meat here was pretty decent! I'll definitely be going back to try more. It looks like they have a really decent specials every day.

The reason this place only got three out of five rating is because the whole restaurant seems a bit dirty. Someone definitely had been smoking in the bathroom. The bathrooms were not very clean. The floors were sticky all around."}
{"text":"Went to Selma's last night because the traffic lights were broken. We were driving for food and not convinced on anything and decided to pull in.  Once we saw they took debit cards, because the exterior really gives a cash only vibe, we went in. A few really friendly people were eating and the only woman working was so kind. We told her we had never been and she walked us through ordering because there are so many options. I ordered the beef brisket dinner which was amazing and authentic. Between our party we had the Mac n cheese, baked beans, fries, and hush puppies. The only thing I didn't love were the hush puppies but I think that was more me than the hush puppy quality. When we left the woman working told us we will be back and she was certainly right!"}
{"text":"Ordered a pulled pork platter with fries and fried okra.  The fries were good, my favorite style, thin cut with skin on.  Fried okra was okay, it tasted like frozen, pre-breaded okra.  The pulled pork was tasteless.  The meat was white, with no visible smoke ring, and no bark.  It tasted like it was oven roasted, not smoked.  There are 6 BBQ sauces to choose from.  The Carolina Pig Pickin Sauce was pretty good, although the pork was so bland it didn't help much.  The other 5 sauces all tasted similar, and we weren't fond of any of them. The tea, both sweet and unsweet were very good.  Can't imagine ever going back."}
{"text":"While looking out the window of the shuttle bus taking me back to my car as I returned home from vacation, I noticed that Selma's was about a block away from the lot where I had parked for the week.  I knew I had no food at home and since I've had Selma's bookmarked for several months, I decided to get take-out.  

As I walked through the door, the patron exiting said, \"I recommend the place highly.\"  I felt confident I had made the right decision.  I went with the James Aubrey's Sampler that included pulled pork, chopped brisket, turkey, hot sausage with cornbread and two sides (I went with mac n cheese and cole slaw).  For sauces I went with the Original Memphis Style, Carolina Mustard Style and Kansas City Style.  Because it was Wednesday, I also received a free coca-cola chocolate cupcake.  

While I waited for my order, I heard that they were out of chicken.  It couldn't have been later than 12:30pm.  This place was pretty popular. 

The standouts for me were the brisket and the sausage.  Both stood on their own and did not need any sauce.  The turkey wasn't bad, definitely better with some sauce (I went with the mustard style for the turkey).  The pulled pork was disappointing.  It had no flavor and definitely needed sauce to liven it up.  The cornbread and cole slaw were nothing special.  The mac n cheese was good.  The cupcake was a nice surprise.

I was hoping to be more impressed since I tried a little of everything.  I guess the plus side is now I know what I liked and didn't like next time I go for some ribs and/or catfish."}
{"text":"No wonder they kicked her out of Texas. She should rename it Selmas House of Vinegar."}
{"text":"This is my second visit to Sema's BBQ and I must say they have some very good food.  It's slow cooked and smoked.  They have a selection of 6 different sauces on the tables, which is great, however I don't feel as if any of the sauces hit the home run.  I have often wished for a great Southern style BBQ place in Pittsburgh, and Selma's is pretty good, but has plenty of room to improve.  The greens are cooked perfectly, the hush puppies are excellent.  I have sampled the fried catfish and the BBQ chicken and they are both very good.  I will keep checking back to see if good turns into great."}
{"text":"The cleanliness of this restaurant is horrible. I'm surprised that it hasn't closed due to the absence of cleanliness. Tables, floors, sticky, spills on floor from who knows when. Lemon slices in the tray where you get your drinks. Looked like they had been there for days. Voiced my concerns with staff. Prompted some cleaning of tables."}
{"text":"Ok, good and bad.  I'll do the good first.  Wife had the catfish.  Two large fillets of decent, flakey white catfish, properly coated in corn meal and fried to a nice golden color.  I had to beg a big bite from her.  The coating was crispy while the meat was hot, moist and delicious.  And she loved her green beans and bacon.  We've finally found the place where a couple of true Dixielanders can get honest fried catfish.

The bad.  \"Selma's Texas BBQ. \"  Well, this sure ain't Texas and I wouldn't even call it BBQ.   Folks, their meat is cooked in a gas cooker with a few chips of hickory to supposedly give a smokey flavor. Hell, you can see the damned thing from the counter!! I got the brisket (Texans DO NOT do pork butt or shoulder and admit it).  No smoke ring, no bark, no real smoke flavor.  I wonder what they would have done had I asked for burnt ends!! And that was the strangest potato salad I've ever seen.  I just don't see how you people from the South and Texas in particular call this good BBQ.   The meat was edible, moist and tender, buts it's not BBQ and that's what they're advertising.  And for good measure, I had them give me a \"bone' on the side.  Again, the rib was oven cooked with only rub on it to give it any flavor.  The pictures on their website are false advertising. The pics added on Yelp are more realisitic and an experienced eye can tell from them that the meat is oven cooked.

Give me a few more warmups on my smoker and you folks will just have to come by the house here in Harmony for real Texas brisket.

We'll return but only for the catfish.  Now, that was good."}
{"text":"This place is actually pretty good. Not sure why it has poor reviews. I ordered the St. Louis style ribs and they were great. The sides of beans and mac and cheese were flavorful and had that unique propriety taste also; it's original bbq. Try it out - the food's actually good here, and reasonably priced for a bbq joint."}
{"text":"Good: The staff were friendly and the prices were cheap. 
Bad: The chicken was watery and slimed. The chicken was most likely cooked from a frozen state. The chicken, mac'n'cheese, and corn bread all were very bland. No seasoning. All the sauces were watery and lacked flavor. Would not recommend."}
{"text":"I respect many Yelp reviews but not sure on this one.    I am wondering if there is a lack of good BBQ.

I have traveled many places and BBQ should merry taste, texture, and smell.

I order the sandwich sampler - Turkey, Brisket, and Pulled Pork.    

I will start with the smell.   There was not any.   The food as mentioned in previous reviews was luke warm - almost warm temperature (but the building was cold - so the food beat it).
The restaurant was void of any aroma from the cooking (the grill looked too clean).   Therefore, I wonder if the food was fresh or made earlier in the week and re-heated.  I am not sure.

The texture...   The meat was on the dry side.  Again - my meal was not hot.   The meat was void of the burnt ends.

The taste - Meat was void of any seasoning.   Very bland.    I added some of the sauces which were different and relfected the styles.   Like the meat, the sauces were not very inspired.

I am comparing this restaurant and the review to others - Shaved Duck - St. Louis, Bogart's - St. Louis, and a chain City BBQ out of Columbus.     I want to like this place but I cannot based on my experience.

I hope they improve and take some pointers from other successful establishments because Pittsburgh needs good BBQ."}
{"text":"I was quite disappointed in Selma's, and I've had BBQ all across the US. I know the difference between a genuine hickory wood smoke flavor, or apple wood, mesquite, or charcoal, but Selma's had the worst type: the \"smoke\" of burnt fat. Sooty, acrid, a greasiness without the richness of wood smoke. And the fried okra was clearly made with frozen pre-battered okra slices; somehow I expected that \"Selma's Texas Barbecue\" would serve genuine battered fresh okra, like you'd find in Texas, but obviously that's too much to ask for."}
{"text":"I've definitely had better BBQ, but my husband said his was good. My food came out ice cold. Entire soda machine was down and there was hardly any iced tea left. Sauces weren't very good in my opinion. The place was really dirty. 

I'm really hoping they were just having an off day because I've heard good things about the place, but I wasn't impressed at all."}
{"text":"I was on my way back from the airport when I stumbled upon this jewel. The ribs were cooked to perfection, the brisket was amazing (my favorite) and the pork fabulous. All the sauces were great I enjoyed mixing and matching. Had the bake beans that are cooked with pork and another home run. Wish I had a bigger appetite to eat it all. Great job can't wait until I am back"}
{"text":"Selma's. So many people talk about it and now I know why. It's  good, quick, reasonably priced bbq. Favorite sides are the hush puppies and baked beans. They have a bunch of sauces on the table that you can pick from and all are quite yummy. You can be in and out within a lunch break and this place fills you up. They have catered an event that I have attended and the food and sides travel well."}
{"text":"Just ate here for the first time with my friends and it was absolutely delicious! I had the fried catfish with sides of baked Mac and cheese and hush puppies. Food came out very fast and the cashier was very kind. They even gave us a homemade cupcake with our meal! Everything tasted very fresh and was very well seasoned. Will be back!"}
{"text":"Yummy BBQ, good portion, different BBQ sauces to try and great service.

Every time I get BBQ at Selma's I'm never disappointed, juicy and tender meats with good sides. 

I only gave this place 4 stars because the hush puppies I got one time was so burnt tasting that it has put me off from getting them again, but everything else is good."}
{"text":"Some of the reviews on here about Selma's are head scratchers...You can get good food for $10 or less and some of you expect it to look like a 5* Restaurant inside.

Bottom line is this.

The food is good, they are inexpensive, and they are nice people."}
{"text":"Service was slow and the food tasted like it was old. No flavor and the prices were a little high. I will not return"}
{"text":"Love to grab lunch here during work. Delicious food, fast service, and amazing choice of sauces!! You get plenty of food for the price you pay, I've never had something I didn't like!!"}
{"text":"Great place to go if you like small portions, cold meat, and pulled pork from a can.

I'm shocked by how many good reviews it has.   Either I'm having the worst luck going there on bad days or nobody has had really good, remember it forever BBQ.

Sadly we don't have many places like that in our area.  

I've given this place 3 tries.    The first was years ago when they first opened.    That time was not half bad.   Then tried it a year ago and left hungry and disappointed.      Decided to try it again for lunch a few weeks ago.    Once again, a major let down."}
{"text":"Very friendly staff, brisket sandwich was very good. Reasonably priced. My buddies had the chicken and pulled pork and said it was great! Def worth checking out!"}
{"text":"First off, we should have turned around when we got in the door. This place was so disgustingly dirty.  My shoes stuck to the floor everytime I moved....it obviously hadnt seen a mop in weeks, if not months. The floor in the kitchen area was worse. Counters, tables, and restrooms were equally dirty. As for the food, we left over half a plate of meat on the table, there was not even slightest hint of rubs, sauce, or smoke. It all lacked flavor and moisture. All of the sauces looked and tasted old.  Husband is sick to his stomach after this one and only visit. Don't even drive into the parking lot."}
{"text":"This place is a dive and that's kinda cool.  Every meal is based around the meat that you are ordering with some tasty side dishes (particularly the corn bread).  It's your standard BBQ fare (Brisket, pulled pork, etc.) 

Where they excel is in the those awesome AWESOME sauces.  So many choices and differences in flavor to choose from and it is honestly difficult to choose.  I ended up just adding small dabs of sauce to my plate and dipping.  I liked almost everyone and really enjoyed my meal.  It was, honestly, kind of fun.

There is nothing about this place that is appealing except for the food.  They know, and as soon as you walk in to this joint, you know it too.  But trust me the food, will definitely appeal to you.  It's worth your time and worth you money.

Prices are pretty good.

I'll be back.

If they cleaned up the place, maybe remodeled, and stayed open later, I'd give it 5 stars easy.  But, at the end of the day, the food is really why we eat out (is it not?) and the food is 4 stars in an circumstances."}
{"text":"I changed from 5 stars to 3 stars. My original review is below, however I just got really bad food today. I don't think I usually go on Thursdays, and I recommend that you don't either. Perhaps they cook only on Fridays? All the meat I got was dry and the brisket was made using really low-quality beef, and I'm 90% sure the collard greens were just reheated from frozen. Nothing tasted fresh at all. I never understood why people gave Selma's a bad review in the past, but this food was just NOT GOOD - and not one thing but all of it! Next time I will call to see what days they smoke. Very sadly disappointed today, Selma's. :( I'm still keeping some stars for the quality meals I've had in the past, but today's was 1.5 at best. 








I really, really like this place!!!

I usually get the combo that is like $21....has a few different kinds of meat and sides (definitely upgrade to a pint bc it's very much worth it). All of their meats are wonderful! Even their turkey is great even though I would not think of that as barbecue food. 

I tried fried okra here for the first time and I thought it was amazing! I'm also a huge fan of their ribs (which I never even liked before) and even the salad is great!

I always get takeout here and honestly where can you find home cooked food that will feed 2 people dinner AND lunch the next day for under $30? Selmas you really are the best!! I just wished I remembered this place more often because every time I come here I am not disappointed! 

The only thing that isn't perfect here is that none of their sauces strike me as something I would ever purchase in a store....but shhh if you have a favorite at home that works too!"}
{"text":"Being originally from The South, where Barbeque is taken very seriously, I have found that this to be one of the best, most-authentic, understated, barbeque joints in town! Generous portions, great sides, awesome sauces and reasonable prices."}
{"text":"I crossed the Ohio, and all I got was this so-so barbeque.

My plans for the day went awry, so I decided a nice scenic(?) drive up 65 sounded like an OK thing to do. I've also been fiending for good BBQ, so I figured I'd head over to Moon and try Selma's because of the mostly-great reviews here on Yelp.

Alas, I'm not quite as enthusiastic about my experience. First, if you're unfamiliar with Moon, Selma's is located across the street from a big Sheetz -- I initially missed their sign and ended up in the back of the airport. They've got plenty of parking available.

When I walked up to the door, I wasn't overwhelmed with the scent of hickory smoke. Not a good sign, but I was determined to eat some BBQ, so in I went. The gal at the counter was friendly, and I ordered the Junior Sampler (3 mini sandwiches and two sides, $13.99 at this writing) in the interests of variety. All for you, Yelpers, all for you. I got brisket, pulled pork and Alabama pulled chicken, along with mac and cheese and collard greens.

I hit up the sweet tea while I waited about five minutes for my food to be ready, and it's decent. They have chipped ice in the machine which cools it off admirably. They called my number and I picked up my platter o'meat, noticing that they gave me green beans rather than collards. At this point there was a decent line going so I just let it slide.

As I listened to The 700 Club playing on the large TV, I tucked in to the Alabama pulled chicken first. Alabama white BBQ sauce has a mayonnaise base and Selma's had a decent tang. The chicken wasn't drowned, just lightly coated, and was tender and moist with no gristle evident. Unfortunately, the smokey goodness I was after wasn't evident, either. It was tasty, but I could achieve about the same results with a rotisserie chicken from the store and my own sauce. The bun (same for all the junior sammiches) was a soft white bread, as it should be for BBQ. Well, if you ask me, it should.

At this point I paused to try the sides. The mac and cheese is pretty tasty and fairly standard, with little crusty bits of browned cheese goodness. The green beans were soft, squishy, and full of bacon. That's a good thing. Both were served so hot I burned my mouth; by contrast, the meats were all pretty much cold after thirty seconds.

Next, the pulled pork. The meat was melt-in-your-mouth moist, and had faint signs of a smoke ring, but again not a lot of smoke flavor developed. Also? No bark! The seasoned crust of a pork butt is, like, the best part. There weren't any bits of fat or gristle, either, so maybe they picked it all out for an even texture. If so, that's a shame, because the flavor was pretty bland. When I smoke pork butts at home, I don't usually bother with sauce until day four of leftovers. Here, I was hitting the sauce after just one bite.

About the sauces: The Kansas City was really not my favorite interpretation thereof; a bit too sweet and overwhelming although it does get points from me for not being heavy on the cloves. The Memphis Original and Hot were both good, with the Hot taking the lead. Carolina Vinegar was edible, whereas the Carolina Mustard (usually my favorite for pulled pork) was a little too thick, sweet and honey-mustard for my palate. The best ended up being the Texas Cowboy, which had a nice amount of heat and tang.

And so, on to the brisket. At this point I wasn't expecting that great hickory-smoked flavor I'd initially gone for, and my expectation proved correct. Like the chicken and pork, the beef brisket had wonderful texture but not a lot of flavor on its own. No bark, not much smoke, no gristle.

I'm not sure what's going on here. Was it all decent? Well, yeah, and if I had just gone in wanting tender meat I'd have been in hog heaven. But I wanted BBQ, and I didn't end up getting it. As I mentioned, all the meat was weirdly clean of any of the outlying textures that add up to great BBQ. It also tasted sort of like maybe they start it in a smoker and finish in the oven.  Now, after meat hits a certain temperature, it stops absorbing the smoke, so that could work -- in theory -- but this stuff tasted like someone maybe waved a hickory twig in its general direction a few times and then let it go.

The sides I tried were good, but not amazing enough to make up for anything else. I appreciate the sheer variety of sauces available but none of them made me want to slather them all over... well, anything. The atmosphere was a little sterile; very bright and white and bigscreen TVs in each corner.

Would I go back? Probably not; there are too many other 'cue joints to check out, and I can smoke better butts and brisket at home. (Poultry doesn't even count; too easy.) I didn't try the ribs, but I'm not super inclined to do so now. This review may come across as being a little harsh, but BBQ is one of those things you've just got to nail for it to be good. Selma's didn't manage that. Alas."}
{"text":"Sadly, this place (for which we'd gotten good recommendations from locals) turned out to be really mediocre. I had brisket which was fatty and had very little smoky flavor.  Portions were large, but what value is lots of blah food?  The place is fast-food in its atmosphere."}
{"text":"I have dined at Selma's several times in the past and it is always yummy.  I like getting a sampler platter with a few different sides.  At your table you can try each of the sauces and I like mixing all the different taste combinations. Today was the first time I ever ordered take out, and the service was excellent.  The order was taken over the phone with ease, when I arrived it was ready to go and packed exceptionally well for traveling back to the office.  We had 6 separate orders and everything was correct, and most importantly delicious! I am truly impressed and I am sure we will be ordering take-out from here again soon."}
{"text":"I ordered Ribs, Greens, & Potato Salad. Sadly I wasn't impressed. Not enough flavor in the meat...didn't love the BBQ Sauce, the greens didn't have flavor either. If u don't require any flavor this place may be for you."}
{"text":"Nice food nice environment I recommend it to try.!!!! 
I like to recommend to go to small businesses and enjoy the food because they deserve it and you eat better.!!!!!"}
{"text":"Went to this place the first couple weeks it open and it was great. Frequent it every couple months and just watch it go down hill. Took a friend there for the first time today and with us being the only people in the place they forgot our order as we waited for 20 mins. When we asked what was up with our order we were given dirty looks by the staff and when we asked for to go container more dirty looks followed by me saying thank you and getting a dead stare by the lady behind the counter. I think that was my last time at their place. I also realized the only thing I like now about this place is not the food but the variety of sauces."}
{"text":"delish homemade BBQ.  I suggest the Pulled Pork Platter with homemade mac-n-cheese & homemade baked beans as your sides."}
{"text":"First time here. Ordered shrimp, hush puppies and mac n cheese. No sauce was given for the shrimp and they forgot the piece of corn bread. The mac n cheese was not worth it. It was so dry, I couldnt finish it. Hush puppies were nothing special. The shrimp wasnt bad. Not sure if I'll be back or not."}
{"text":"The food was good but the restaurant was filthy. The staff at the counter were pleasant and accommodating. I wouldn't go back until they clean it up."}
{"text":"Tonight was the last straw. I've been a Selmas die hard for a long time. But the service has gotten to the point that I'm done. The food has never suffered but the inconsiderate treatment and inconsistent hours have made the trek elsewhere more of an option. I hope management comes to their senses and figures out they're not serving the customer. You aren't doing me a favor, I'm here to give you my business."}
{"text":"Ribs n'at...yeah, it's an okay place. The issue I have is that I can make ribs better, for a lot less money. There could be more smoke on the flavor, and a more tender rib, but it is what it is. If you must go to the rest room, make sure you go after you eat. Yeah, it can be more than a bit harsh in there."}
{"text":"The Warm Fuzzy's:
* plenty of seating in a country like setting 
* five different sauces to choose from
* friendly staff
* plenty of parking

The Cold Prickly's:
*  expensive 
* not much meat on the ribs
* ribs were only luke-warm 
* beans were mushy and you can tell they came out of a can

Verdict: 
Probably won't be back."}
{"text":"Good, didn't dive in and get ribs or a messy sandwich for the reason of not getting my work shirt stained, but my chicken sandwich mixed with white Alabama sauce was good but not over the top awesome. Fries were good and the multiple sauces on table were a huge plus for me since I love different BBQ sauces."}
{"text":"Note: This place is also dine-in. I say that because the website makes it seem as if they only do takeout. 

If the woman this restaurant is named after was alive today, I'd hug her and peck her on the cheek for bringing some mighty fine pulled pork to the Pittsburgh area. En route back to Pittsburgh from Beaver Falls early this afternoon, we stopped here in search of good, good BBQ and found it. 

I got mine in a sandwich, topped with cole slaw, and with a cup of potato salad.

The meat was as tender as I reckon Selma to have been. An array of BBQ sauces in plastic ketchup bottles stood at attention at the side of the table. I tried three of them and can't remember what each was called, but each made for an excellent condiment. Not that they were needed. The meat was of high enough quality that I nearly ate half the sandwich without using any of the sauces. 

Who discovered that cole slaw goes well with pulled pork, and was it a happy accident or something purposeful? All I know was that that the slaw was fresh, crispy, and superb. 

Geez, who needs lettuce, tomato, onion, and dressing on any sandwich? Just pile on some slaw, and you are all set. 

Potato Salad Snob Report: Selma created a sturdy everything-but-the-kitchen-sink recipe. Darren W. approves. 

Kay got the BBQ chicken which I found on par with the pulled pork upon tasting.

We shared a copious cut of their Coca Cola Sheet Cake for dessert and both found it to be slightly dry and day-old but far from inedible. 

I like the Selma's diner/fast-food/quick-serve/cafeteria set-up. You belly up to the counter, order, and (at least in our case) your food is brought to you on real plates. Sliverware (also real), napkins, and a soda fountain (free refills!) are around the bend along with freshly brewed iced tea and lemonade (it's pretty good), both made in-house along with everything else.

We spoke with the proprietors who thanked us for our patronage and compliments. They've only been in this location near the airport for about 7-8 months and have plans to make this a chain someday. Hey, I can live with more Selma's, and this is the very first one. Ya think this is history in the making? Will there be a Food Network documentary on Selma's 25 years from now?  I'd like to think so."}
{"text":"Crowded little place.   Stopped in for lunch and was surprised at the number of people, most of the tables were full, so it must be good.   The local ambulance squad stopped in, so it must be good.

Always fun to try a BBQ with some slow smoked meats.  Unfortunately, so many selections and not much time or hunger to try a Sampler with 2 or 3 meat combos...next time.  While Selma claims to be a Texas Barbecue, there are 6 homemade sauces you can put on your meal.  Of course most of the sauces are named for areas know for BBQ, ie: Carolina, Memphis, Kansas City, Texas.  Tried many of the sauces, while I tend to like mine spicier and not to sweet, most of the sauces were a little sweet.  The Hot Memphis style was more my style.  The Carolina reminded me of a sweet mustard.  

The staff at the counter was very patient and helpful with questions.  The Mac & Cheese is the most ordered side, I was told.  So I had to give it a try.  The Mac & Cheese was nice and creamy.   For those who like veggies, there are collard greens and fried okra.  I tried the fried okra and it was pretty good.  Ordered the ribs and they were cooked to a fall off the bone tenderness, had a nice smoke taste but really were better with the sauce.   The ribs have a dry rub and are cooked with Hickory wood that must help give it that smoke flavor.   A corn bread roll came with the ribs and it was OK, a little dry but was good with the ribs.  

Someone near us had the catfish and it looked good.  Lots of pulled pork sandwiches too."}
{"text":"I liked Selma's a lot.  Not a perfect place and I have had better, but I would surely stop here again.  I had the two meat meal and added a 1/3 rack of St. Louis ribs.  So all told I had some brisket, sausage, and ribs.  

The Good: Brisket was good, tender, flavorful and smoky.  Adding some of their sauces makes this pop and was truly tasty.  Maybe it was a little dry, without the sauce but when sauced, this was just alright with me.  Also had a small slaw order.  This is decent vinegar and mayo based slaw.  I would have wished for a little more bite but it was OK overall.  

The Better: Ribs were tender and juicy.  A slight pull on the meat releases it from the bone and renders it ready for saucing.  There is no watered down taste as if they are parboiled beforehand so the flavor is intense throughout the meat.  

The Ugly:  The sausage.  Pass.  These are like an Italian sausage that is smoked.  The flavors seem completely off and my serving was dry as a bone.  Well past what saucing could correct.  Didn't even finish these.

So next time I go with a rib platter and maybe add some brisket or try the chicken.  Since I don't get to Pittsburgh very often it may be a while until the next time.  Stay tuned...

BTW I realize I messed up the good, the bad and the ugly thingy.  Just roll with it and give me a pass this time.  I'll do better next time."}
{"text":"I've had the macaroni and cheese as well as bbq chicken, brisket and greens over my three visits here in as many years. They have a few different sauces to choose from and the one I always gravitate to is the Texas sauce.
Let me say that the greens are fantastic! The macaroni and cheese is full of cheese flavor and melts in your mouth.
The chicken was a little too dry for me. However it still had good flavor and so I chalk it up to an off day.
The brisket was good and can hold its own but I've had better.
All in all if you're in the area and want something different then it's worth a shot."}
{"text":"What a great lunch spot! I have not had BBQ this good since I lived in the South. I tried the pulled pork sandwich, the ribs, and the mac and cheese - all were fantastic and they have a variety of sauces to go along. The mac and cheese was particularly good, but since mac and cheese is one of my favorite foods, I may be slightly biased here. The meat was all also very good - you can tell it has been cooked to perfection - to the point that the meat falls right off the bone. 

The service was a little spotty, but it is in line with the price and the great food makes it well worth it. Be prepared to wait if you come at prime time for lunch."}
{"text":"I have been dying for BBQ since I moved back to the area...Selma's was a good start!  I got a meat and 2 - pulled pork, mac&cheese, and collards.  We stopped for a late lunch and I really wanted brisket, but they were out.  Pulled pork was very good...flavorful and juicy.  I tried the gold sauce.  It was good but could use a little more acidity.  Mac&cheese was a little disappointing...creamy and perfectly cooked, but totally bland.  (Nothing a little salt and hot sauce won't fix next time.) The greens though???  Wow!!!  I like mine cooked dead - but these were still fresh and bright and green with a little crunch and WOW!!  What a revelation!!!  Also, I think made with smoked turkey - so good!

I look forward to going back and trying the brisket..."}
{"text":"A real find in the absolute middle of nowhere!!  Huge portions, five or six kinds of sauce and tender smoked meats and sausage. 

Lots of specials that change by the day, which can make the stop more affordable.  I had a three meat sampler, consisting of pulled pork, chopped brisket and hot eye-talian sausage.  Wonderful!!  Moist, tender and flavorful.  Served with a nice cornbread muffin and your choice of two sides.

Most BBQ places purporting to be of the Texas variety fail to deliver....this place does, in spades!!

Get. In. Here!!"}
{"text":"They do NOT smoke every day.  Leftover bbq is not good.  The ribs were way overcooked."}
{"text":"Food was good. Service was bad. Billy took our order and acted like we were aggravating him. I felt a little uneasy about him preparing my food because of his attitude. The potato was old & overcooked, very brown in the inside. The last two visits here have taught me to come much earlier and pay attention to who is serving us. Billy must be family..."}
