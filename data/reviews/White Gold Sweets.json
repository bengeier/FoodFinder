{"text":"Found this place randomly based on the previous reviewer. Stopped in around 7pm and was surprised to find them open still.

Samosas were large and crispy, with an excellent flavor. Also had 1/2 lb of pakora, also excellent. The tamarand sauce was a bit thicker than I had expected, but went quite well with both. Definitely going to be back to try some of the sweets in the future!"}
{"text":"Samosas and spring rolls are a must have from
White Gold!! You have to order the spring rolls a few hours in advance but they are worth it. I found the spicy samosas way too spicy (and I like my spice) but the regular samosas were perfect, not too bland and not too spicy."}
{"text":"I'm not quite sure why there are bad comments, I've never tried their catering food but a friend recommended this place years ago to me and my family and I absolutely love getting our sweets here. The owners and people are genuine; yes it may be pricey but the times I've gotten any sweets it was quality fresh sweets. It's a tiny place but they're very sweet people. Their samosas are sooo good."}
{"text":"No way will I ever go back. The service is like molasses. The sweets are so dry that they must have been there for days  very unhygienic.  Don't do it.  Mt advise to you. Way over priced for the quality.  Will.  Not should not go here. Free advise."}
{"text":"One of our friends took us to this place and I have to say I am truly in love with the place. I havent had such authentic Indian snacks since India."}
{"text":"The place to go for foods that are typically from the state of Gujarat and some of the foods that are more main stream popular are also available. 

The most common Gujarati snacks available are Kachori - dried green peas, cooked and spiced with hints of coconut deep fried with batter (5/5), Pattice - stuffed with coconut and variety of different ingredients in a potatoes outer which is deep fried as well (5/5). Then there is Khandvi - a mixture of chickpea flour and yogurt which is cooked, and rolled. The rolls are then tempered with mustard seeds, curry leaves and chillies. (4/5). The Khandvi is too greasy for our taste. And also unlike Kachoris and Pattice are sold by weight. 

Then there are typical samosas, with spicy and non spicy ones. They are also available in two distinct shapes, the typical that the main stream folks see, which we call them Punjabi Samosas and then there are the flatter ones which sometimes are called Patti samosas, named after the wrap. The spicy ones are spicy, so if you can handle the extra spiciness go for it- they are delicious. 

There are other items such as bhajias, fafda and patterwale also available but that is for some other day. There are also a variety of sweets - burfis and laddoos available. 

Do ask for sweet and spicy chutney. Especially the sweet one is the best anywhere west of India 

The biggest beef I have with them is they charge 0.20 cents per debit card transaction which is not posted and they have a sneaky way of not showing how much they are charging on on debit machines. Also do ask for a receipt as they do charge HST but sometimes not show on receipts"}
{"text":"The samosas are awesome. The chat papdi is phenomenal. It is probably the best chaat in the GTA, with a perfect balance of sweet and tangy sauces and spices. Definitely going back soon for more !!"}
{"text":"I was in the area, hankering for some samosas, and decided to pick up some spicy ones!  Samosas were already ready, on trays, not fresh outta the fryer like last time.  :(  

On my last visit, I did ask for spicy, but they weren't ready, and I was in a rush, so I never got them.

Comparing the regular vs. the spicy ones, I preferred the regular samosas.  Then again, the regular ones were fresh, fresh, FRESH, so that probably made a difference.  The spicy ones had a bit of a kick and had mint leaves in the potato filling, probably some turmeric on the wrapping.  Samosa was not overly greasy, but good.

Aside from samosas, I haven't had anything else here, but apparently the dhoklas are supposed to be good?

Note:  Take-out ONLY!"}
{"text":"AMAZING SAMOSAS!!! fresh and really tasty. extremely affordable and cheap. highly recommended :) !!"}
{"text":"Via satellite the industrial parks near Dundas and Hwy 403 resemble a featureless grey morass. George Orwell no doubt envisioned these sort of drab units when pondering the future. But unlike 1984, there is White Gold at the end of the dystopian rainbow.

Open seven days a week, this Gujarati-run place is a doubleplusgood place to score fried Indian goodies, sweets and snacks. It's a takeout place, so there isn't room to stick around and it's adviseable to call ahead. We placed an order for 30 samosas for $0.50 each, and also picked up a pound of assorted sweets ($8). 

The samosas here are quite different than the soft, flaky and plump variety I am used to. These are firm, crispy, and uniform in size. You'll probably notice the potato filling is cleanly chopped rather than mashed. In a sense, these samosas are a bit too perfect. Not my favourite, but OK. 

They fare better with the sweets. Standouts include the almond and cashew mithai (look for the beige diamonds with silver foil on top) and their peda. Their peda are soft-round circles with a cross on top. Brilliant.

There are better options for both sweets and samosas in Mississauga, but White Gold is certainly a great choice.

Obligatory Title Pun: Worth its weight in GOLD.

Menu Readability: There is is a price list above the counter, but you're best to just ask what's up.

Need to mention: You could get a decorative box for an extra $2, but the regular ones are shiny enough for me.

What this place teaches me about myself: I'm pretty casual about the use of terms like \"dystopia.\""}
{"text":"This place is not to be missed! Samosas and khaman are phenomenal. Do not miss either. The aloo tikki's are delicious too. Give the puffs a miss.

And if you can handle your spice - they do spicy versions of the samosas - get them. They take the experience to a whole other level."}
