{"text":"5 Things:
1) When you're blazingly drunk
2) It's 2 A.M. when most businesses are closed
3) You're in downtown and can somewhat crawl, walk, or stumble drunk to Chinatown
4) You want a \"memorable\" and \"cheap\" night with friends dining (depending how much food you want
5) And you just really want some god damn dim sum and don't care about the quality

................... Go to U & Me, it's about as good as the place gets


If you're sober and you know what good quality dim sum tastes like......let's just say that your opinion might be very different to what it was when you were in a lesser lucid state of mind."}
{"text":"Love this place, as I don't need to worry when m late because I can eat anytime."}
{"text":"The first Chinese restaurant I went to after moving here from Vancouver.

I went with my friend who doesn't know anything about Cantonese food and who happens to like fried rice (well I do too but it's his favorite).

We went there after working out so they had 2 hefty appetites to fulfill.

We ordered:
-the Chicken Fried Rice.  My friend doesn't eat pork so my usual selection was out.  This dish was just ok.  For the price, I was expected more: just filled-up 5 of those small bowls.  I'm used to larger servings back home in Vancouver I guess.
-dim sum: shrimp rice rolls.  This was my least favorite dish.  The texture was way off and the rolls tore easily.  There is a happy medium and these rolls were nowhere close to that.
-dim sum: ha-gao.  This was ok.
-dim sum: beef meat-balls.  This was also just ok.

In general, the dim sum dishes at $6-7 is over-priced for what you get.  Places in Vancouver of similar quality is $4-5 per dish.  I'm willing to pay $6 or more per dim sum dish at Kirin levels of quality only...so you can say I was disappointed.    

-salt-and-pepper squid.  My friend and I both agreed that this should have been better.  It was mostly batter.
-the steak dish on a sizzling plate.  I guess this was my favorite dish.  Worth it?  Hard to say at $19...but I guess if both me and my friend both enjoyed it, it was worth it.  I think I'll try the BBQ duck next time instead...as this beef dish is something I can quickly whip up at home.

Total price $67 before tip.  This place was just ok.  For the price, definitely not worth it if you're coming from Vancouver.  In Vancouver it would have been $50 before tip, max, for a place of similar quality.

I guess I'll check another place out instead the next time I get a Chinese food craving...which is quite often."}
{"text":"Very dirty! poor service and expensive. I honestly think Alberta health should close this place. 
I can't believe two pieces of dim sum would cost almost $20, $20 is a full meal!!

Edit: Apparently Alberta health is already looking into them and find this place unsuitable for business. I just don't know how it is still open:

{"text":"Since most of Calgary rolls up the sidewalks at 5pm, it's nice to have some late night options besides Denny's and A&W.  I've only ever gone late at night and there's pretty good food if you know what you are ordering.  The authentic Chinese stuff is quite good and they do have some unique dishes and dim sum late at night is awesome.  Not sure how good the western Chinese stuff is as I'll never order that stuff in a Chinese restaurant."}
{"text":"Everyone should read my review, because I'm the one to give the most honest reviews

Cmon U&Me is now 24/7, that means the food they prepare and cook is most likely to be frozen, I came in one night with two buddies of mine.

One thing I noticed about Chinese staff, I believe most of them are immigrants that come from China and are not legal citizens to work in Canada, most of them are paid below the average minimum wage, and in restaurants such as these dim sum links, most staff don't even receive tips. (Don't ask how I know, but I'll keep it confidential.)

These people serve you their food and sit around at the front watching you eat, they always got something to say especially if they think you don't know Chinese, they gossip about everyone that is eating and have very rude manners, it's annoying and it's not good for the western business, maybe it's good for the local
Chinese, but not for others.

Food is frozen for sure, ordered their Sui Mai, a Chinese delicacy. Took a bite in the middle, it was cold. I honestly, don't get what people rave on about this place besides the fact they are 24/7. If I would rate this restaurant out of 5 it would be a 1, but the restaurant is opened 24/7 and I'll be giving it a 2 for that. But U&Me isn't gonna be my first option when I'm craving food at night, or dim sum in the day."}
{"text":"\"Open   20  hours
8 am -- 4 am daily\"

The first lines of U & Me's website declares what kind of a business this is. This Chinese restaurant is smack in the middle of Chinatown and does it proud - good food and dim sum around the clock. They've turned around from their vermin inspection and are back with a vengeance...

Whether it's for a quick lunch downtown or late-night munchies after a night on the town, U & Me is there for you. It's reliable enough that people keep coming back: At lunch, don't be surprised if you have to share a table with two or three other pairs.

The service is even pretty reasonable, in fact. They also give you a scantron-type form to fill out to order your dim sum - almost feels like a return to grade school exams, but where everyone wins!

I had a headache after eating here once, which I attribute to the MSG in their plain congee, but otherwise no complaints. (I laugh to myself reading this - the things I go through for tasty food...)"}
{"text":"Are you serious people !!!! I noticed my review and others have been posted and taken off. I've heard comments of people getting sick and the service and food is terrible. I am one of the bad commenters. Going there late at nite and drunk and hungry does not mean you know what your talking about. I've eaten at a few dozen different Asian restaurants and most are only tolerable and this one is not."}
{"text":"This restaurant is mecca for anyone who has ever felt frustrated that Calgary seems to shut down at 8:30 PM, leaving you hungry. Nestled in the heart of Chinatown, this fantastic Chinese restaurant is open from 8 in the morning until 4 in the morning.  You heard me right- they are open TWENTY hours a day. The hostess explained that they close for four hours a day to clean and then they open right back up again. 

I have been to You & Me at 11 in the morning, 9 at night, and midnight, and I have to say, I'm a little infatuated with the place. They have a huge dim sum menu, and the dim sum is really good! I mean, it's not Vancouver dim sum of course, but it's still tasty and satisfying, and you'll stuff yourselves silly for $10-$15 per person. Dim sum is served from opening until 5PM, and then from 9PM onwards (during the dinner hours and nighttime hours, they do regular  a la carte dishes). The daytime dim sum menu is more extensive than the late night menu, but there's certainly no lack of choice at night.

It seems like this place is always busy and understaffed. The service is the only reason I've taken a star off. Food sometimes takes a little longer than you would expect (they don't do dim sum carts here as far as I know), and the busy waitstaff can be pretty brusque. We've gotten used to having to ask two or three times for water, and expect that they might miss a dish or two on our order. But all in all, it's worth it for the practically any time of the day dim sum!"}
{"text":"Came for dinner. Service and food were excellent. Very fast very tasty. The hot pot dishes are super yummy!"}
{"text":"Really great dim sum at any hour!  My husband I agreed this place was excellent, and we just went to China in May!  The boneless fish congee was delicious, as well the soup dumplings.  The only meh dish was the sticky rice wrapped in lotus leaves.  If you want dim sum, definitely stop in."}
{"text":"only good thing about this place is they open late. Bad customer service (just servers) especially the guy
l.  I been there 5 times cuz there no place to go at night time.. food is below standard.. and they brought out wrong order and was rude ."}
{"text":"You'd think since I work downtown I'd take advantage of the Asian food Chinatown has to offer, but I never do! 

It's actually pretty busy here during lunch (and I'm not sure if you can make reservations) so I'd recommend coming early. The 3 of us arrived shortly after 11:30 and still had to wait a bit for a table. Once we were settled, we each ticked off on the order sheet what we wanted - shrimp dumplings, chicken feet & ribs in black bean sauce, deep fried wontons and the like.

The food came out quickly and we slightly panicked since it looked like we ordered waaaaaaaaay too much food (isn't that always the case with dim sum?) Everything was really tasty and of course the company made the experience even more enjoyable.

I don't know if it's the MSG or the greasiness but I'm always super parched after dining on dim sum. But I'm sure as long as you keep your water and/or tea cups full, you're golden."}
{"text":"I'm not the biggest dim sum expert (yet!) but boy do I love going out for dim sum with those that are. I'm not a morning person, especially on the weekends, but a friend told me that this place has half price dim sum before 11am. Yep. 

We arrived at around 10am on a Saturday morning and the place was only about half full. It did take a little while to flag someone down when we were ready to order, but they told us what each dish was when serving it and promptly brought out more tea each time we emptied the pot (turn the lid upside down!).

My top pics: shrimp and pork dumplings, shrimp stuffed eggplant, sticky rice in lotus leaf and steamed sweet cream cake. We ordered two items each, which was the perfect size for our group of five - plus an extra serve of the steamed sweet cream cake (trust me).

The best part? It cost us $11 each including tax and tip."}
{"text":"U&Me is a Chinese food restaurant full of Chinese people, and that is a review all on it's own.

I have experience with large Chinese new year dinner parties at this restaurant and the service is prompt and attentive, the food good and in huge portions and the atmosphere loud and bright.

Don't expect much out of the bathrooms, use them after your meal if you must.

Good place, good food, busy.

{"text":"Came across this restaurant while in Calgary with family. The crispy chicken in garlic soy sauce is one of the best I had in yrs. They give a large serving and price is reasonable. Will return if I'm ever back in the area."}
{"text":"I've been here once and I loved it. I ordered dim sum (which most people get), and they're awesome. My favorite would be their chicken and corn soup. Their fried chicken in soy sauce is really good as well, crispy, not too salty and juicy. I think I need to visit often so I can try everything on the menu!"}
{"text":"I LOVE U&Me. 

U & Me offers great authentic, delicious options from a huge menu at an affordable price. 

They're located directly downtown, near hotels, bars, and not far from the LRT. They're also open very late (4am I believe) making it my #1 spot to end a night out."}
{"text":"This place is a little too authentic for me.  Half the stuff on the menu had things inside I would never put into my mouth, let alone ingest.  Chicken feet and duck tongues, for instance, so negotiating the menu (mostly written in Chinese with brief and vague English translations) was pretty tricky.  The staff either had very poor English skills or weren't the least bit interested in providing guidance or the time of day, for that matter.  I felt proud when just about everything I deciphered from the menu turned out to be good.  The one bad thing--some sort of deep fried pork dumpling that I think was little turds wrapped in a slab of hog's fat then deep fried (like pork rinds except hot and greasy)--gagged both my husband and I.  But hey, it was an adventure."}
{"text":"First of all if you dont want diarrhea dont go to this place. I saw one of the workers dropped his towel on the floor and used it to wipe the table -_-. The food is average,i would rather go to the calgary court nearby. Also,the servers are really rude! They throw the plates and expect you to give a tip for the bad service."}
{"text":"Our go to \"late night drunk in Calgary\" spot.  We hit this after a night of drinks this past Saturday, as we often do when visiting Calgary and we stay downtown. Our go to dishes are the XO Noodles, Salt & Pepper Squid, and Shrimp & Pork Dumplings. Always tasty, hot and fresh. Great late night eats."}
{"text":"Breakfast dim sum here. Decor very modest and old time. Service good with few customers on weekday. Dim sum good to very good. Congee mixed meat excellent with good flavor."}
{"text":"This was the best dim sum I've ever had. The congee and Chinese donuts were absolutely fantastic!!!  Nice environment, clean, and always full which attests to how good it really is!"}
{"text":"I am not gonna lie, I like this place.  In Calgary, it is really rare to find a restaurant that opens at 3am!

When my friends and I want to go for dim sum, this place will be the first pick.  Although on the weekends, you might want to go before noon because the line up is just crazy!  

Food - hits and misses I would say.  But it's dim sum, it can't go too wrong.
Services - well, they are getting better.  
Price - very reasonable.

I would recommand this place to anyone who's new to Calgary and love dim sum."}
{"text":"I have been here twice and plan on coming back many more times!  

I have not had the dim sum - which judging from reviews, is what most people get - but what I needed both times was some amazing vegan food, which was precisely what I received.  Vegetarians and vegans, this place does it right!

I LOVE the salt and pepper tofu (I think they might've taken it off the menu, but if you mention it to your waiter, you can still order it).  I could not stop eating it.  The friends who came with me could not stop eating it.  I am salivating as I write this... trust me, you need to order this dish.

My friend had a soft tofu with vegetables and mushrooms in sauce type of dish, which was great too.  It was very flavorful and the texture of everything in the dish fit just right.  

The tea was yummy and complimentary.  I THINK you pay a little bit for the rice, but they give so much that you can split it with another person and still end up stuffed.  The portion sizes for everything was HUGE.  You'll probably end up with leftovers.

I paid in cash both times and do not believe that they automatically deduct 20% for gratuity with that method (as some reviewers have complained that they do this with cards).  Of course, I still left a tip - they deserve it with the prices they offer, and the quality of the food."}
{"text":"Where have you been all my life? Ok admittedly this is my fault as I had only been at 3am once before for some very tasty late night eating. I had zero idea they did such great dim sum.

1. before 11am all their dim sum is $4 an order even on weekends!
2. they take reservations
3. they have dim sum all day everyday
Whats not to love!

We ordered so much food it was unreal. That being said in our defense I feel like a lot of the portions were bigger than normal. There were 6 shanghai soup dumplings in an order for example. A lot of the typical 3 in an order dim sums actually came with 4. Lovely surprise. 

We tried the following and has multiple orders of most dishes: steamed shrimp dumplings, steamed shrimp and pork dumplings, baked egg tarts, steamed garlic spare ribs, steamed egg yolk buns, pan fried taro root cake, pan fried turnip cakes, baked bbq pork buns, steamed shanghai style dumplings, steamed bbq pork buns, steamed sweet cream buns, chinese doughnut in rice roll, spinach with beef in rice roll, steamed cuttlefish in curry sauce, deep fried shrimp spring roll, steamed sticky rice in lotus leaf, stuffed dim sum in black bean sauce (shrimp stuffed in veggies), shrimp stuffed whole eggplant, pan fried beef curry dumpling things (off special menu) and pan fried fish cakes.

Holy goodness that was so much food even for 11 people!

Wish I had taken a pic of our receipt as it went on for days. At the end though it came to $21 each including tip and we had to take some left overs with as we rolled out the door. Definitely best value for money before 11am.

Made a reservation no problem for a Saturday morning and they didn't seem to care if we had a minimum amount of people.

Would easily be 5 stars except that we couldn't order anything other than dim sum before 11am. Makes sense with the discount but really wanted some noodle and veg dishes.

We will be back and bringing the hunger!"}
{"text":"Whenever I think of this restaurant, I think of this exchange on twitter a couple years back between two friends of mine:

K: \"Craving Chinese. Where's a good place for lunch, tweeps?\"

W: \"U & Me, Centre St.\"

K: \"YES! I would love to catch up! Haven't seen u in forever! Let's have lunch?\"

W: \"No, that's the name of the Chinese place. I don't want to have lunch with u.\"

Because I've only ever been here whilst either three sheets to the wind, hAngry or in the throes of a prescription, I'm going to tell you that this is the BEST RESTAURANT IN THE UNIVERSE, AND ALL OTHERS ARE INFERIOR. Also, try this water. It is so liquidy.

So that tells me that my star rating should probably be a solid three when I am running on all four cylinders. But who goes here when they're of sound body and mind? That's not what it's here for. Quick service, vegan options, open in the middle of the night, possibly a front. If it was on wheels, I would have them cater every party I throw. 

Try the crispy tofu!"}
{"text":"I would never go here again. 7 of my friends and I went here around 1 o'clock at night and  the service was horrible. 
He took really long to get our orders and took forever to simply grab us water. 
We also ordered 8 dishes and only 7 came out. We were really hungry and started eating, thinking that the rice, the last plate, would come out soon. We finished and was full before we knew it. We figured that the waiter missed the rice plate when we were ordering so didn't bother with it anymore and asked for the bill. 
When the bill came out, we got charged for the rice but kindly told our waiter that the rice never came out, pointing to the 7 dishes on the table. We expected for him to just simply take the plate off the bill, but he turned around and started yelling to the kitchen in Cantonese to make the rice. 
They kept on insisting that we take the food, but it didn't make sense, when we were full and ready to leave. The plate was finally taken off the bill after having a debate with the waiter.
At the counter, another girl gave us a hard time by telling us that there is 10% tip on orders with 8 people or more. But from my restaurant knowledge, if the restaurant does charge a gratuity fee, it would indicate so on the bill or in the menu. But there was none on either, so we found it hard to believe that they charge a fee. Again they kept insisting that we must pay it before we leave. 

This was probably the worse service I've ever had, where I found myself fumigated with anger. I would never go here again, when I could go to other Dim Sum place that has the same quality of food with better service."}
{"text":"A waitress had given us a dish we had not ordered.  We realized this when we started taking the first bites.  When we complained, the waitress realized that the order was meant for another table, so she took our dish that we had already started eating, and gave it directly to the other table.

At the end of the meal, they asked for $120 total and refused to show us the receipt.  Turns out the meal was $97 total and they were asking for more than 20% WITHOUT letting us know.

Terrible, terrible service, even for an asian restaurant."}
{"text":"One of my favourite Chinese restaurants in town. The food is very reasonably priced, there are many options on the menu, and the service is delicious. Service is hit or miss, but it's easy to flag someone down when you need them."}
{"text":"We went here just to placate the growlies a couple years ago, and sure is a drag to spend good money on mediocrity, but when most customers seem to be white (as we later found out), little wonder. My fault.

The 3 mains and 2 sides we ordered were passable, but really were only mediocre rich starchy-sauced counterfeit versions of what I know is much much better elsewhere. The mixed vegetable fried rice was okay but the others were forgettable. Ah, but the name should have been a dead giveaway. So much for us stumbling around before doing a bit of research.

Never return unless it's the only resto on a deserted island... But hey, perhaps it's changed ownership since we were there, and therefore these later reviews may reflect that...

But for me, skip it, and go to Silver Dragon for dimsum or Bon-ga for great Korean."}
{"text":"Been here a few times service is okay wouldn't be the best, but also not the worst. 
What i don't like is how they told me a few times its cash only and i remember one time i actually went to my bank and get cash.......  Other wise its a nice place for late dinners."}
{"text":"U & Me ranges from three to four stars, depending on when you go. The best time to go is around noon on weekdays and weekends. The worst time to go is late at night, such as 1AM. I think the more experienced cook works at peak times.

My experience is always better when I go with friends who know the owner. There is one dish that is just fantastic and not served at many other places. It's a deep-fried radish dim sum dish. There are layers and layers of soft, fatty goodness encased in this melt in your mouth pastry casing. The flavour is so unique too... its hard to describe."}
{"text":"Dimsum from open to close!! This is my favourite Chinese restaurant, I've been here countless times for lunch and even 2 am runs. This place is usually busy when dinner comes around, but service is fast otherwise."}
{"text":"Great 24/7 dim sum restaurant in China town, good foods & decent prices. Portions are very decent. They are a all day full restaurant. Just a bit under staff in my opinion during busy hours."}
{"text":"went here two weekends ago and it was sooooooo gooood.
we had the ginger beef, a few different kinds of dumplings, shrimp and
vegetables and it was delicious.  everything was served piping hot and
fresh and the atmosphere was cute, clean and nice. two thumbs up."}
{"text":"The dimsum was good. Very authentic. The custard buns were amazing. However, it was more on the pricy side so one star gone for that. Compared to Toronto, this place was sooo expensive; on average $6 a plate of dim sum."}
{"text":"I was there with my wife for dim sum this weekend.  We got there at around 1 p.m. and got seats right away, which we thought was a little strange.  It has been a while since we've been there for dim sum, but we had to wait for seats every time in the past.  

U & Me always have innovative dim sums, we noticed something on the wall about specials and new dim sum dishes, so I had to go take a look.  As I was reading the poster, one of the waitress came and talked to me in a somewhat rude tone saying 'we don't have it'.  I question her on what they don't have, and she said the specials... it's over.  So I said fine, I wasn't looking at the specials anyway.  I asked her if she had the new dim sum dishes and she responded by saying ' yes, but they are at the regular prices'.  Instead of calmly explaining what is going on to a customer that doesn't mind paying regular prices, they came across as very rude.  My wife later went up to the same poster and was greeted with the same rudeness by another waitres...  Very disappointing!  

Here is my rating:
Food: 4/5 stars
Service: 1/5 stars
Price: 3/5 stars (there are many places in Calgary where you can get similar quality dim sum for less)

There is one more thing.  This place does not accept credit card payment for bills under $30.  I didn't argue and just pay cash, but as it is well known to me, that violates one of the mechant agreements with credit card company.  It is time for U&M to wake up!  Even Misai/Forbidden City/T.Pot don't have a minimum limit for using credit card anymore, as they know it's wrong."}
{"text":"The waitresses have a very unhappy attitude. The gluten-free option recommended was steamed veggies, so we ordered it with garlic. It came without garlic and with no flavor whatsoever. The rest of the food ordered seemed very sloppy and certainly not worth the price. One of us left their unfinished food behind. Despite all this, the waitress noticed we didn't tip and demanded that we did so, which we thought was rude."}
{"text":"I came here at lunchtime on a weekday for dim sum with a group and everything was great. We were provided with tea right away, within 10 minutes of handing off our filled in menu, dishes started arriving.

My favourite dishes included the pan fried turnip cake, the spinach with beef in rice roll, and the ginger beef (a non-dim sum item, but still tasty). As well, I'd recommend giving the house special congee a try. The creamy rice porridge comes with shrimp, tripe and other beef parts mixed in and topped with peanuts.

For a \"dessert-y\" item, try the sesame balls which come stuffed with chopped peanuts and shredded coconut!"}
{"text":"I've been here for three times, all of these are good. I feel like the foods are a little bit salty and a bit expensive than other similar restaurant. It includes all kind of dim-sum except for something specific."}
{"text":"Fantastic dim sum.  Have the shrimp spring rolls!"}
{"text":"Just meh- very busy place with a long line up.  Estimated wait time from server was 20 minutes, but was actually about 45 - we stayed as 20 minutes didn't seem bad, doubt we would have stayed for a 45 minute wait.  Food was okay but definitely overpriced for dim sum."}
{"text":"5 diners, midnight start time with one objective: sample as many authentic Chinese dishes possible before maximum stomach capacity exceeded.

I confess I had someone who spoke Mandarin and another who has spent time in Asia among my party.  They did the ordering.

However, it would not be difficult to order from the extensive menu.  Dim sum and more traditional choices abound and we did not have one bad dish, though some linger on the memory palate more than others.

This is inexpensive and feels like eating at one of your Friend's houses and their Mom keeps affectionately plying you with food.  Rare service at this price point! A great sense of humour was also present in the staff when we went.

There was enough food to eat beyond satisfaction and for us all to have take-home containers."}
{"text":"GREAT place for FAST Chinese food.
Open LATE - I have only been here for dinner or after last call.
GENEROUS portions.
They treat their regulars with consideration.
Bathrooms? Meh ... that's where the 5th star almost went ..."}

{"text":"Looks a bit gritty but the food is great. Service is fast and succinct. Make sure you try the Crispy chicken. Open late."}
{"text":"Went to Chinatown this morning to feast on Dim Sum at my favourite place only to find it closed for holidays *sad face*. Opened up my trusty Yelp app and found U and Me close by with decent reviews. When we arrived the tables were about half filled so we were seated immediately and given the menu and order sheet along with our tea and our requested cold water. 

Now I should mention that when I go for DS with this particular friend we order A LOT! We enjoy trying lots of different things and always bring enough for full family meals home (who doesn't appreciate not having to cook???). Our regular place knows this and starts off by bringing us containers and bags so we can pack some things as we go. This place looked at our sheet and came back to confirm that we knew how much we ordered. It makes me laugh because when I go with my Asian in-laws they also pack up lots to bring home but any new place I go checks that I know what I am doing.

Out of our large selection of items the standouts were:

- Pan friend shrimp in tofu wrappers
- Deep fried shrimp dumplings
- Doughnut rice rolls 
- Pan fried sticky rice

Everything else was either ok or good with the exception of the deep fried pork and shrimp dumplings as we found them too fishy with the amount of dried shrimp. 

I have read that this place is open late and has dim sum all the time which I like. A solid meal and I suspect at some point we will return."}
{"text":"Decent place for dim sum at night. They need a menu with photos for those less familiar with dish names!  Decent food for price, open late. The best dishes were the bbq pork in rice wrap (and i usually dont like bbq pork!) And Shrimp and pork dumplings (like shu mai)."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Chinese restaurant in town. I just love the fact that they're open all night. It's quite unusual for Calgary and it reminds of my time in Malaysia.

Like most Chinese restaurants they have a huge menu so don't expect every single item to be good. The best way to explore the menu is by sharing food. Portions are huge so sharing makes even more sense. 

I'm a big fan of the shrimp fried rice and the crispy noodles. 

This place is packed at dinner time and that's the time I wouldn't go there. I love it for a late night snack (or huge meal)."}
{"text":"When I took a trip to Canada for a week, my brother insisted on us eating at U & Me for late night dinners. I'm from New York and I can say this is true Chinese food! 

The food is mouth watering, every bite I had was extremely good. We tried things from fried dumplings to dim sum to chow fun. Everything was so so good! Also, side note, the iced tea is to die for as well.

Typically with an authentic Chinese food place like this, the service is rushed and not the nicest but I was definitely impressed here. The servers were all friendly and very helpful. If I ever make a trip again, definitely stopping by!!"}
{"text":"Took a drive from the Sheraton into downtown Calgary where there's a Chinatown. My dad found this place before the trip, but didn't end up liking it. I thought the food was decent. We got egg pancake with oysters, oyster congee, sweet and sour pork with fried milk, fried eggplant, and fish. We ordered two beers and four mango jelly slushes. Not a terrible option for Cantonese food."}
{"text":"Was treated to dinner here on Wed 24 Aug 2011 by some friends. Food was okay. Maybe I'm just getting picky after having been in Richmond, BC recently and going to a seemingly endless variety of Chinese restaurants."}
{"text":"To give this place one star tonight was generous. I know, it's not supposed to be good Chinese food. It's supposed to be shitty Chinese food that does well because it's open super late. I get that. But hands down this was the worst ginger beef I have ever eaten. To call it ginger beef is a stretch, it's more like stale, sinewy beef jerky in sauce. HOW OLD IS THIS GINGER BEEF? There's no way it was fresh. Do they leave it out on the counter for days before pouring sauce on it and serving it? Am I eating the leftover ginger beef from Friday night? Golden inn is leaps and bounds ahead of this place in terms of quality and freshness, and they have similar hours.  I feel as if I have been robbed. Robbed of what should have been a delicious meal, robbed of the extra minutes I have to spend picking the hard stringy bits of \"beef\" out of my teeth, robbed of my hard earned, legitimate money I was tricked into exchanging for this dismal meal!
There is no good reason to eat here, unless you hate yourself."}
{"text":"My first visit to U & Me was in the middle of the day and both the service (despite the fact that the place was almost empty) and the food was terrible. Anyways, I heard from multiple sources that it had some of the best authentic food in town, so I rustled up some people to go back to check out the scene - late at night this time. I'm happy to relate that this visit was a lot better food wise.

I'm a dim sum addict so being able access my tasty \"ha gao\" (shrimp dumplings) at any hour is pretty much heaven for me. It's actually open and busy until 4 am, so it can be a pretty good place to people watch  while you're chowing down. Lot's of big and little groups - actually, I would say U & Me is probably one of the restaurants most able to host a large group for dinner with short notice in Calgary.  

In addition to dim sum they serve the traditional canadian-chinese menu of mostly cantonese inspired dishes. The dishes are hit and miss - sometimes they are really, really good, and sometimes you wonder if that was actually what you ordered. I'm not the biggest fan of their dinner menu, but it is decent. The service is so-so and the entrance can be difficult to find. This place isn't fancy, either. In my opinion there are better, more consistent Chinese restaurants in Calgary during the day, especially close by, but for a late night snack it is pretty much the top of its game.

Try and get a window seat for some really good views of Chinatown!"}
{"text":"Where can one go for 20 hour dim sum in Calgary?  Well U & Me Restaurant of course.  

Well one night I treated 16 of my students there to enjoy a dim sum meal.   The food was okay and the tab at the end of the evening including desert and drinks was around $160; not bad for treating 16 u's to a meal.  

The biggest problem is that it is always a hit and miss when I go to this restaurant.  Food can be great, but at times service people have been incredibly rude, or service is great but food comes 30 minutes after ordering, then the drinks.  I think if you are in the frame of mind of wanting to eat at any hour of the morning and are so buzzed from a great evening out, don't mind bad service and long wait; this may be the place to go.  

The food menu is not limited to just dim sum you also have the choices
of some speciality items like fresh hard oyster shell, thai stir fried clams, bbq duck,  jellyfish and beef just to name a few between 7 to 16 dollars."}
{"text":"This restaurant saved me and my DC when we arrived in Calgary late at night and found that Chinatown was completely dead with everything closed at 12am. Everything except U & Me! Open to 4am, the place was quite busy with people post-Stampede and other stopping in for take out. The food was quite slow as a result. We had the flat noodles with pork which was nothing to write home about but did the job of curbing our late night munchies. Service was typical Chinese restaurant service - fast and efficient. So efficient that they served our order in a styrofoam take out container anticipating that we wouldn't finish the food and would need to take leftovers home anyway!"}
{"text":"The stairway leading up to the restaurant gave me the expectation that it would be filthy inside, but the restaurant was relatively clean, and the service was good considering it's a Chinese restaurant.  Food and prices were decent for dim sum.  Whoever designed the men's restroom did not care that the urinals are in the direct line-of-sight from the door."}
{"text":"Best congee in town. Your experience here will depend on what you order and when you go. We stop in here for lunch on work days all the time and the experience is great!  Food is prompt and the congee is phenomenal."}

How is it that I always seem to find myself at U & Me for a 2am, 3am, etc. dim sum run? Wait... perhaps because it's one of the few places I can ever think of that's open at that hour... any day of the week... including Thanksgiving Monday! Although I guess that might make it Tuesday.

If you don't know what to order, let your server do it for you. Ours did a delightful job of picking a few key dishes she thought we'd enjoy. I still can't remember what they were, but she did us right.

And at the end of our meal, she was inviting us to return again!

Tip: Avoid on super common drunk nights, I've been in at times when there are some decently sketchy and/or weird people in there."}
{"text":"Like Agnes, I was raised with the understanding that honesty is the best policy. Thus, I shall not lie either. 

U&Me is amazing. I love it here. Dim Sum 22485 hours a day?! Yeah, you don't have to wake up at 9am on a Saturday to go here, you can slum around the house until 3 pm and still get your Tripe in Ginger and Onion Sauce, BBQ Pork Steamed Buns, and your shrimp dumplings.

The food here is good. and most importantly, it's cheap. So cheap. I took my mother and brothers here for Mother's Day (because I'm also cheap, but sweet), and for the 5 of us, it was something like $70 with tip. And let me tell you we gorged.

Obviously, there are better places to grab some dim sum in Chinatown, I think of Silver Dragon, but U&Me is a pretty great place for you and me to go."}
{"text":"To be honest, the ratings actually alternate between 3 and 4.  There are some dim sum meals on weekends that I would give the freshly made food a 4 star rating.  There have been some dinners I've had that would be 3 1/2 to 4.  And then there are the late night meals that are 3 at best, with wildly alternating quality and selection (I've walked out a few times because they actually ran out of some of the most basic snacks at night).  
This resto is about as close to a 24 hour chinese restaurant as there can be in Calgary, as it's open every day from 8am to 4am 365 days a year.  The food is usually pretty authentic, and it's all satisfying sober or drunk.  Service is usually pretty good, even despite the odd server or two who passes by with english 101.  Just don't expect a lot from the decor or the view, and just enjoy the company and the food."}
{"text":"One of my favourite dim sum places in Calgary.
Food is always hot and fresh. Love the sticky rice, Cantonese noodles and, of course, the dumplings. Decor/ambiance is what you'd expect from China town - certainly not fancy but it's authentic and cleanish. Good for take away too."}
{"text":"First time coming here this week and I'd say the food and service is pretty good. The amount of food they give you for the price is pretty fair, in my opinion. I missed their deal of $3.50 (I think it was) for a small, medium, or big dish (before a specific time...) because I came in around 1 pmish so I ended up having to pay normal price for those dishes... Their juk/jook/congee or however else you'd like to call it was really really really tasty to me that day for some reason!"}
