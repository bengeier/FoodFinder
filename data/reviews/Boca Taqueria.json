{"text":"My family tried Buca as a take away after a busy day of errands. When I first walked in, I was pleasantly surprised. The restaurant had a small eating area but it looked clean and nicely decorated. Then I waited in line and it started going down hill quickly.  There were a few people in front of me but the line was moving quickly. When I was next the boy who was taking orders laid his head on the counter and left. I was completely confused why he was laying his head down on the counter, and he didn't take something from underneath so....  now to the girl taking orders. She was very peppy and nice but went overboard on relating to the customer. After the boy left I got to hear a five minute conversation about her eyelash extensions. Something I don't want to hear when I'm about to try a new restaurant is your fake eyelashes falling out.  I ordered steak burrito and a veggie burrito combo. Steak burrito was quite good however the veggie burrito was sour cream and refried beans.. there were more veggies in the steak burrito then he veggie burrito. Also 2$ worth of beans and rice was one small section in a styrofoam to go box. Definitely not the price for this place. Especially when the menu is misleading"}
{"text":"Ordered the chicken flying saucer which I absolutely love and order every time we eat here. Tonight as I took a bite there was a bone in my food. I brought this to the attention of the manager and his response was \"sorry this does happen from time to time\" What! Okay I get that mistakes happen, but that was it...no meal comp, nothing just an \"I'm sorry\" Very poor customer service! I am so disappointed that I may never come here again."}
{"text":"I am not a fan of ordering my food and then sitting down.. But they served great food! I knew it would be too much food to finish in the restaurant and asked to have it in a to-go box, but was encouraged to have the meal on the plate because \"it just tastes better\".. And they were right! The food was out fast it was hot, chips and salsa were great! Large portions."}
{"text":"This is my go-to place for Mexican food. It's so good and my kids love going there. The workers are friendly and the atmosphere is clean, fresh and modern. They did a good job with how things look. 

GREAT PRICE: I don't understand these reviews that complain about the food being \"over priced\"... compared to what?? It's all relative people... this is not a dive or hole in the wall taco shop. Maybe that was the expectation behind some of these reviews? 
** I took my kids there on Saturday and we all ate for $25.09... for 1 adult + 4 boys (they eat a lot). This is totally worth it. 

BEST MOLE IN THE VALLEY: The chicken mole is by far my favorite meal there (ask for side of sour cream)...... and I am always trying places. 

The BEST GREEN SALSA that I've ever had... and it's consistent. I used to say that Tia Rosa's had it, but this place is even better. 

All their meals are huge and we always have left-overs, which having kids it's a huge plus. 

TAKE OUT: Boca is a great option for take out. In fact, I do take-out here more than dining in. They are quick and pack the food well... it's in and out through the side door which is great during their busy times. 

I would recommend Boca Taqueria to anyone!"}
{"text":"I ordered the shredded beef Chimi with red enchilada sauce. This has to be my least favorite Chimi I've ever had and it wasn't cheap. If you go to filibertos then you know your getting cheap and lower quality Mexican food. However this place the meat itself was very tuff and the sauce was tangy. The rice was sweet as well, I ve never had no much sweetness with my Mexican food. I would not come again, please save your $ or spend somewhere else"}
{"text":"This is now my favorite Mexican joint.  The flavors are amazing. The staff is so friendly and they get everything out in pretty good time.  Kudos on the new place.  
I love coming here!"}
{"text":"Yummy food and really great staff!  I stayed for hours chatting with a friend and the staff couldn't have been nicer.  They cleaned up all around us, offered drinks, and never made us feel like a burden for staying after our bill was paid and they were closing up shop.  I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere, tasty, fresh food. We were glad to find this new location so close to our home. We will definitely visit again particularly when they get their frozen margarita machine!"}
{"text":"I came in to try their fish taco...they put a lot of cheese and butter to the fish and it is grilled.  I added lime lime and took the first bite...it had an awkward taste of sweet and sugary and I couldn't taste the lime in it anymore.  Their recipe was too sweet for my taste.  Most importantly, way too expensive. That one fish taco was $4 after tax and just a tad bigger than a street taco...most of the weight was the cabbage and cheese.  I will come back and give them another try (maybe their other stuff is better)."}
{"text":"The best! Yummy tacos. I recommend the beef or salmon. Great atmosphere, friendly staff, and patio seating. Nice little bar area with amazing margaritas! Great place to get food and hang."}
{"text":"I had the grilled fish taco & steak taco. The fish was ok, needs to be seasoned better. The steak was a barbacoa beef that had been put on a grill to have sear marks. Not a fan of the bland taste of the meat. I was expecting a sirloin or a chuck steak type of meat. The salsas, I tried all three. They were okay. Nothing special. None of them were spicy. My preference for spice is a Serrano. Roasting a chile goes a long way and it would give the salsa a better taste. The reason I give 2 star-, for effort. Plus their tacos are not street they are larger and the tortillas are warmed up with some oil. 
Nice location, clean location and they have a bar. Cute place that will need adjustments."}
{"text":"This was my 2nd visit.  It was disappointing. I ordered 2 steak tacos for $10.  A bit pricey.  They served decent portions, but the steak was terrible.  Tough, dry, and flavorless.  I couldn't taste any seasonings.  Just very disappointing. The first visit I had the cheese enchiladas and they were fine.  

The service staff was friendly and helpful.   I'd rather spend that somewhere else, and enjoy the food more.  And even at a lower price, the steak was disappointing. 

I wish them luck.  I like non-chain places to eat."}
{"text":"ROACHES!!!! So disgusting! 

My workmates and I decided to try Boca Taqueria, Mesa location, since it was close by. The atmosphere was adorable and the food smelled great. We decided to sit at a couple of center tables put together. 

About five minutes after receiving our food, baby German cockroaches began crawling all over the table. My coworker screamed so loud that the women sitting nearby were startled and asked what we'd seen. I went up to the register to speak with a cashier and what I assumed was a manager.

Just after telling them about what we'd just witnessed, the manager said, \"We figured after hearing your friend (my coworker squealing). We have the owner on the phone now.\" I said, \"Oh, so you know about this?\" The manager said, \"Yeah, but that's why the owner is on the phone.\" Still no apologies at this point. I must've looked shocked, and the cashier, a nice young lady, said, \"Those tables were outside, so we're thinking that's where they came from. We're just as disgusted. We've been dealing with this for two months.\" I walked away in absolute disgust. Baby roaches don't stay babies for long. If any were attached to those tables while outside two months ago, they had already set up camp and had been laying eggs in the restaurant.

At this point, we were moving from those tables to two booths. As my friend and I were moving our meals over, another manager came by to proclaim his apologies and to say that the owner has had someone in to take care of this and doesn't know why it's still happening.... And they are STILL serving food?!!!!

Shortly after moving to the booths, a baby roach crawled out of my salad. I almost started crying and took the salad to the manager we had just spoken to and said he needed to take it from me. He pretended like it couldn't be happening.

After sometime (we assumed he was on the phone with the owner who advised him to deny deny deny), he came back to the table and completely retracted what he had said before. \"This has never happened here before, and we don't know why it's happening.\" He was nice enough to give us our money back, but that could never makeup for one of us or any other guest getting sick. Also, lying is such an unappealing quality in someone who is serving you food...

Making a call to health services over this."}
{"text":"Still is one of my favorite mexican places! Very fresh food! They are the next generation of Tia Rosas and the only place with the original recipes! Try the shrimp burritos with enchilada red sauce, it's what dreams are made of!!"}
{"text":"Newest trendy hangout spot in Gilbert! Its a hidden gem!! Try the shrimp burritos with enchilada red sauce, yumm!!!!!"}
{"text":"This review is for the taco truck. 
I drove into my apartment after work and saw a big orange food truck, yay no cooking!  I have to say this was way better then I expect from a food truck. My husband had beef tacos and we shared the beef nachos. Best nachos I have had in a long time!
Everything was really fresh and the shredded beef was tender and very lean. 
Please come back to San Antigua"}
{"text":"Reminds me of the original Rosas.  Better than the Tia Rosas down the street, an less expensive.  I will drive the extra mile.  Always been a fan of their shredded beef flying saucer and green sauce. Nachos are huge.  You will need to pay extra if you want chips and salsa."}
{"text":"We arrived here with my parents - our first time visiting. Here are two big menu boards to look at - things were pretty clear. When I did have a few more detailed questions, the person working was very helpful in explaining the menu items. I ended up getting a beef burrito and my wife the 'Macho Nachos'. I really enjoyed my burrito - no complaints here !  But I will be getting the Macho Nachos next time!  They not only likes great, they tasted great too!  Loaded with lots of fresh toppings and it came out hot and melted.  So good!  While we were there talking after the meal, we had the same person who helped with the detailed menu questions come and clear some of the plates off of the table. This is NOT a restaurant with servers - she simply came over and said - 'Let me clear these off for you while you guys talk!'  So nice!  We will be back - keep up the friendly service!  It's just as important as your great food!  Prices were reasonable (smaller 'fiesta' burrito price can be $4-$5, 'grande' size a couple bucks more; Nachos were around $8 ...  )"}
{"text":"I've grown up with a Tia Rosa's (now Boca) down the street from me and it's always been my favorite Mexican restaurant. I love that I can still get the same great food near my current house. I haven't dined in at this location yet, I usually order takeout. They have always been super quick and get the order right. I love their chicken tacos with rice & beans. The prices are great too!"}
{"text":"When my uncle visits from northern cali the first place he goes to from the airport is here. Also where everyone in my family eats every tuesday. Incredible food for good prices. Very family friendly and clean as well!"}
{"text":"The 3 rolled tacos, rice and beans were good. Wish I could say fantastic, but would have to say pretty average. My husband got a pork burrito and it didn't sit well. Green sauce w child was great. I used to love this place, but I feel like the quality has gone down and not worth the over crowded seating. Will try it once more and see how it goes."}
{"text":"Really good! Decided to try Boca because we are huge fans of Tia Rosa. The food was of great quality and the portions were quite large. The staff was also super friendly and helpful in letting me know about the menu items. This is a new spot, so the interior is very clean and modern."}
{"text":"LOVE this neighborhood taco shop! They are a break away from Hacienda de Rosa that is a few blocks away in Mesa. The rolled tacos are delicious and their patio is perfect for an evening margarita."}
{"text":"This place is one of my favorite go-tos for Mexican food. You are greeted with a friendly smile when you walk in, your food is prepared quickly and accurately, and it tastes great. Nice atmosphere."}
{"text":"Didn't even know this location was open until I looked up the old location to review the menu! Outstanding customer service."}
{"text":"Terrible excuse for Mexican food. Ridiculously overpriced. Only in Gilbert where folks don't know what good Mexican food is would this ever fly. Do yourself a favor and go into central Phoenix for amazing tacos and all the fixings for $1 -$2 each, not the arm and leg they charge here for subpar food, bland meats and insipid salsas."}
{"text":"This location recently opened up close to my home and have been there several times....the food is wonderful and fresh...I have a feeling they will need to expand soon as this place is getting busier by the day!!!"}
{"text":"Two burro kids meals, one chicken taco combo, one ala carte pork burrito for $20. We thought that was very reasonable. 
The pork was moist and flavorful. We all love the beans. 
Looking forward to finishing the leftovers tomorrow!"}
{"text":"First time coming here and loved the service and the food!!! Salmon tacos were so good and flavorful!! My wife, who doesn't like fish, enjoyed them. So overall super satisfied with my food!"}
{"text":"Great Happy Hour menu with food and drink.  Looking forward to going back again soon."}
{"text":"Went to Boca Taqueria  tonight for dinner. The food was terrible.  Definitely does not even deserve one star. If you like your meat cooked in a crockpot this place is for you. Also, premade taco shells and hot sauce that taste like unsalted canned tomatoes just untasty. Too bad because the ambience  is cool."}
{"text":"Boca Taqueria is a trendy establishment with a nice amount of indoor and outdoor seating. Overall, mexican fare is pretty gringo-ized, but its fresh and tasty and we liked it. They have a couple of different beers on tap, plus lots of great looking, reasonably-priced items on their menu so, we'll definitely be going back."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places. Super delicious food, my favorite is the green chili burrito. The green chili has a sweet taste to it. Also love the churros. Highly recommend, food is delicious and great service."}
{"text":"Boca is my new favorite fresh Mexican joint! The quality and quantity of their food is very good! You literally can't get your hand around their taco it is so full of ingredients. Loving the beef chimichanga and of course, Taco Tuesday! Salmon tacos with orange and mango are very addicting. They have a small bar, good selection of tap beers and a great happy hour Tuesday to Saturday. I almost hate to tell people about this place, as it will get too busy. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Go here for TACOS!  Everyday!  Happy Hour (2-6pm) specials only $1.25!  ($2.25 for fish, salmon, and shrimp). Highly recommend the tostada too (only $2!)."}
{"text":"Boca is SO good! The sweet green chili pork chimi was just fantastic! We're fast becoming regulars in the locally owned hot spot. Save us a table!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went for happy hour. We got the nachos for $6 and it was a good size portion. They made an extra enchilada by accident so they let us have it for free. The meat had really good flavor and the beans and rice had a good taste to it as well. We also ordered the tortilla soup which was amazing. I would go back just for the soup. Everyone was really nice and friendly and it seems like they get a pretty decent dinner rush."}
{"text":"Spent some time with the guys at Boca Taqueria. I'm just visiting the area and happened to goin while they were there. Coming from California, unfortunately I cannot say that I am used to the hospitality, generosity and kindness shown by the Boca guys! I had an hour to kill and they helped make it worth my while! My wife and I will definitely be spending some time here while on our vacation! I have no reservations saying that beyond all the praise for good food and drinks, Boca also has good people!

Finally made it back today for food! The beautiful one in our relationship went for a shrimp tostada with rice and beans. The other in our relationship chose two shrimp tacos and one salmon taco. We did not choose poorly! The fruit paired with the shrimp and salmon was incredible! And that green salsa takes me back to a tortilleria that sadly closed years ago in the town where I live. Needless to say, we have definitely found a go-to eatery for fresh and tasty taqueria when in  the area!"}
{"text":"Overpriced!  I ordered a shrimp taco, a shredded beef taco and rice and beans.  The shrimp were the size of a nickel and had mango salsa.  Not only were the shrimp cold, but the liquid from the salsa made the tortillas break apart.  I expected more for $5.  Shredded beef was course and dry.  Rice was $1.45 and beans were $1.45.  Plaque said \"Rice & beans $1.49\".
The best item was the rice and who goes to a restaurant for the rice?  To go order did NOT include fork or napkins.  Who knew you had to ask for them?  Will NOT EVER be back, especially since Salsa Cabana is in the same center, but was closed for Vet Day."}
{"text":"My new favorite place for tacos and other simple Mexican fare. The enchiladas are absolutely awesome!!!"}
{"text":"Great place to eat. Great prices and a step up from the small fast food Mexican places around. Fun atmosphere too."}
{"text":"First time going there.. although we did not participate in happy hour- they do have it daily! My husband loved his chicken tacos. I ordered a chicken enchilada, chicken taquitos and an order of rice
The enchilada was okay.. not super flavorful..
The rice had NO spice or flavor at all..
I liked the taquitos the best.. just wish the cheese was more melted. 
Was not a fan of the basket of chips with small cartons of salsa.. your chip doesn't even fit in the container!! A salsa bar would be more fitting...
They have indoor and outdoor seating. You get a number when you order and they just bring your food to your table.
Pop machine is in the back for free refills
We might come back and I'll try something different since my husband really enjoyed his tacos even though they were a bit small.. the restaurant is new so just some tweaks and improvements need to be done."}
{"text":"Love this place. You won't be disappointed. I always get a shredded beef burrito with chips and salsa. Service is great, restaurant is always clean and the owner is a really nice guy. Hope they build more locations soon. You order at the counter then they bring the food to your table. You get great restaurant quality food at a more affordable price."}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised when I got there but when the food arrived I thought it was just ok. I was surprised that they use tilapia for their fish tacos. 
It was just okay, green salsa was good."}
{"text":"Obviously if you liked the Tia Rosa's Taqueria, you're going to like this place.  Fish and shrimp tacos still hit the spot."}
{"text":"I have eaten over 2,000 salmon tacos from here... Its the only thing I get and the best food anywhere. Been eating them for 14 years now. They have other locations. If you like salmon, it's a must have! Lots of pepper and salt."}
{"text":"Went the first day I saw a sign saying open, was greeted and said they weren't open yet but to come back this weekend , I came back but it was Sunday and they aren't open on Sunday .  Finally I made it back and was able to get food .  The food was kind of bland and lacked the authenticity that I was expecting.  It was very reminiscent of Tia Rosas ( I think they were the same owner at some point ) and I felt the same way about that place .   For the price and what you get , I can't give more than 2 stars . The inside of the restaurant  is nice and hip ( much better than tia rosas) but I can't really say I was a fan of the food .  There is a burrito place across the way that is better for some stuff and if you really want quality and authentic Mexican food , head over to Isabells Amor on Williams field ."}
{"text":"Not the worst and definitely not the best.   It's not \"authentic\" mexican.  It's pricey.  If it were pricey and delicious it would be worth it, but what you pay for a fish taco with wet fish that is cooked in honey and butter, it's not worth it.  I think it's supposed to be Baja style.     They have a small bar with liquor and beer.  I feel it's a lunch place not a dinner place, seating is not very comfortable.  They do have curbside take out.  They DO NOT serve complimentary chips and salsa - you can order and purchase chips and salsa.  The employees I encountered were polite."}
{"text":"Very good food, small but yet quaint service was excellent didn't take long once I ordered to get my food. Very clean very friendly will be back again to try the remaking menu items..."}
{"text":"ordered:
- macho nachos with shredded beef

pros:
- beef was tender and had a good smoked flavor
- portion was much larger than expected [had a ton of beef]
- price was fair
- interior was clean
- service was pleasant and the food came out quick

cons:
- salsas were a bit bland and had no heat
- menu was a little overwhelming"}
{"text":"Taco Tuesday!  Came here with the wife for lunch.  2 huge tacos loaded with meat for something like $5.  The staff is crazy friendly and the ambiance of the place is what you'd hope for.  Many smaller tables and some big / communal high tops.  It also has a bar, which is not what I was expecting.  I'll have to try out a margarita next time.  I'll be back for sure!"}
{"text":"This place was a decent find... I luckily came in on taco Tuesday and they had dollar off tacos and I got the salmon and  pork taco... my classmate had a tamale and she said the flavors were good but there wasn't much meat in it... the owner was very friendly and greeted us at the counter... another plus is there are no waiters so no tip .... hips and salsa were average.... saw a customer with the chimichanga and it looked delicious as I will b back to try this....overall nice bang for my buck"}
{"text":"Food is good.  Try the street tacos: chicken, beef, and pork.  They come three to the place, so get one of each.  The plate of mini-chimis is also well worth ordering. I just had mine mixed, and Christmas style.  Staff is friendly, the guac is good and the service is efficient.  I definitely would eat here again."}
{"text":"I'm so thrilled to have my beloved Tia Rosas back.  I don't quite understand what's happened to them from a business standpoint but do hope the new Boca is better managed so it doesn't go bankrupt again.

Negative: I think it's so lame that you have to buy chips and salsa.  It would go a long way to offer that for free.

Pros: super cute vibe, delicious and fresh food.

I ordered the chicken mango salad (no cheese, no crutons).  It was fresh and spicy and the chutney was incredible."}
{"text":"I walk in and just stand there. Manager and employee right in front of me. I know what they are thinking which is \"We are busy doing something\" 
Cool, As the customer I can see that but you really can't acknowledge someone who entered into your business to spend money and which takes how many seconds? This happens every time. 
Seriously if the food and happy hour wasn't that good, I would be giving a 1 star and say go to Nandos -Yes the service there can be 50/50 but the food is quality and quantity. 
This place might be just the take out place to skip the hassle. 

Happy hour Monday to Saturday 2-5 
$1.25 to $1.50 cantina tacos
$1.25 to $2.25 bean and cheese burrito 
$1.00 cheese crisp 
$2.50 beers
$3.50 house margarita"}
{"text":"My husband and I really like this place. They changed the name recently and I panicked when I couldn't find it online. But we took a chance and drove here and happy to see same menu, same staff just different name. I have had a 30plus love affair with nachos, but I'm very particular and have NOT been happy with what most restaurants offer. This place does nachos supreme right! I usually get the pork option and I love that slow roasted smokey flavor of the pork. My husband usually gets the chimichanga with chicken. We are always happy coming here."}
{"text":"At first I thought it was overpriced for lunch but it was dinner sized portions. We took half of it home. 

I had the Chicken Mole - mildly spiced but flavorful, and the large amount of chicken breast was moist and shredded easily with just a single fork. 

The green sauce was amazing!  Deep flavors and just the right spicyness. Best I've EVER had by far!

The beans are obviously done in house, and like the green sauce, the best I've had. 

We'll definitely be back!
Chicken mole photo."}
{"text":"I've been to Boca (formerly Tia Rosa) many times. Love their food! Although, my order tonight (6/21/17) was underwhelming. I got the low carb plate with steak and extra guacamole and sour cream, came out to $20! I've gotten this before though and I knew good food comes with a price though or else I would have just gone to Filibertos. I got home, opened it up, and... the \"steak\" looked like shredded beef. I know their shredded beef, this was definitely shredded beef. Looked and tasted like shredded beef. The pieces would fall apart if I rubbed it between fingers. I called my friend who use to work their and sent him a picture, he confirmed... shredded beef. Not to mention, I've gotten this exact same plate before, the meat was steak, not shredded beef. I paid an extra $3 or $4 for the steak so I drove all the way back their. Showed the manager (not Clay) and cooks, they said it was the steak just cut up. I insisted it wasn't and showed how easily it broke up. The cook then went and got a piece of shredded beef and showed me, which looked like what I had, just cut up but he insisted they were different. They then went on to say that the beef and steak are the same, they just don't shred the steak like they do with the beef... NO, steak and beef are not the same in the culinary world. I paid extra for a better part of the beef, hence the name STEAK. This was definitely a chuck roast (shoulder) part of the cow, slowly cooked, meat falls apart easily. Finally, they played the guilt game and said if I wanted to they would grill a new steak and not cut it up like they did with the one in my hand. I declined because of the way they were talking to me, like I didn't know what steak is. I disappointing went home knowing I got scammed $3 or $4 for steak. It was almost 9 and they were to close soon so I know the cooks just didn't want to cook the steak. For now on I guess I will just have to go to Filibertos for my low carb, affordable, options. Leave a comment on whether that looks like steak or shredded beef!"}
{"text":"I'd read this was so-so, but my hotel next door recommended it.  I'm from Texas and perhaps I should have tried more of a variety.  There was some fancy named tostada that was just ok for +$10, had a side of white queso (it was good)."}
{"text":"Always fresh ingredients, prepared perfect! Great margaritas and atmosphere. This is my go to spot for mid-day meal!"}
{"text":"I love this place because 1. It's super close to my house 2. The house margaritas are bomb for \"house\" The food is good, I like their green salsa and love their churros !!"}
{"text":"So we opted to try out this place and it's a 3. I dont understand the high reviews of this place. 
Had the tacos, beef, pork and chicken, one of each. The beef is the better one. The other two are flavorless.
I also ordered the bean n cheese. This is actually really good!
My wife had the enchilada plate. This is also just ok.

Some other reviewer said it best. This is like Filibertos with alchohol... but the tacos at 'Fili B's are better 

Probably will not make an effort to revisit...."}
{"text":"Our first impression of this little chain fast food Mexican was pleasant. Great presentation of the menu and helpful staff. 

From there it went down hill. Our meals were bland and what flavour present was unpleasant. My husband ordered a chimy. It likes those a lot in most other places. A good staple for him. He made sure it came with rice and beans, another Mexican food staple. It was not flavourful and the chicken was dry inside. The rice was not seasoned well and tasted like white rice that was coloured red. The beans must of had liquid smoke added and neither of us were a fan of the taste. We couldn't finish them. I ordered chicken tacos. The chicken had a weird taste. On a bright note the condiments on the tacos were nice. 

As for the salsa that came with the meal, that is our signature tip off for a good Mexican joint. The green salsa was sweet and the red sauce was more like tomato sauce. Neither struck us as good salsa. 

There wasn't anything really wrong with our meal (I.e made us feel icky) we just were not a fan of the type of Mexican food served here."}
{"text":"Stopped here for a quick bite to eat. I was visiting from out of town for work, and I could see this restaurant from the window of my room. I was very pleased with the quality of food, but was absolutely impressed with the level of service that was given to me, and every other person in the restaurant. What I thought would be a 15 min quick bite turned into an hour and a half meal with great conversation with locals and the staff (Spencer and Natalie), despite the fact that much of their business appeared to be take out. If you find yourself in the area, or at the Banner Gateway hospital and/or Residence Inn, then you owe it to yourself to check out Boca!"}
{"text":"From the testy manager, to the tasteless food, Boca was a waste of our time.  There were no  tables to sit at, especially when the restaurant catered to a group numbering close to 20 people by pushing most of the tables together.  These same people let their kids run freely through the restaurant, with a mentality of \"It takes a village to raise an....\"

When we finally found a table to sit at....in the parking lot, it was still dirty.  I apparently had the gall to ask the former Tia Rosa manager if the chips and salsa were complimentary, because he got disgusted and stormed off, even as I offered to pay for them.  Figuring he was gone for good, he returned and practically threw the chips on the table, again storming off.

In our opinion, Boca will not last long.  We live and frequently dine in Gilbert, so we appreciate good food and better service.  There are much better restaurants, especially on Gilbert Rd., where the food selection is very diverse, well made, and has an even more \"diverse\" crowd."}
{"text":"Well the staffed warned me that the chile rellenos aren't like any others I was at a loss at what was presented is a chili relleno. It's just a pepper that was cut open and stuffed with meat. Their large taco aren't all that large. Overall good food but overpriced and weird execution."}
{"text":"The service was very pleasant, but there are almost no vegetarian options. Their refried beans, rice and corn tortillas are veg and everything else has some component of meat or lard, including the flour tortillas and the other types of beans. Some vegetarian options would make it to where I would return, but can't justify coming here for only those super limited options."}
{"text":"This place is super cute inside! I love the vibes that it gives off! The service was also very good, the food was decent but not as good as I was hoping! I would definitely go back to try something else!"}
{"text":"This is a pretty good Mexican place. We have been to their location on greenfield as well and we have been pleased with the service at both locations. We love their nachos, but Today I had the shredded beef chimi and it was also very yummy. The shredded beef has a Smokey taste. The portions are very large and able to be shared. I do like it, but I don't know if it has anything that wowed me enough to think of this on a regular basis to come back to"}
{"text":"I'm always excited to try a Mexican restaurant. This one fell short of expectations. Had chips and salsa to start, well mainly chips, not very much salsa. I had their specialty tostada dish my wife had the green chili pork burrito. She said her was pretty good. Mine was soggy just after it touched the table and the shredded beef had a burn flavor. Maybe their just new, hopefully working out the kinks..."}
{"text":"Good food. Extremely friendly staff. Very clean atmosphere. Does have a bar and happy hour. The lemonade is great. Don't skip on the green and spicy salsa. Only down side was the size of the cheese crisp and the plastic forks. I will be back to try the mole. It looks awesome."}
{"text":"A wonderful place to try some good tacos in the gilbert/Mesa area. Went on Taco Tuesday's and has $1 off any taco purchases which was a pretty good deal. Overall great customer service and food. The 4 stars were given because I have been in many other taco places that are around the area with much tastier Tacos. Yet, everyone has a different taste so please give it a try ;)"}
{"text":"Cutest corner restaurant with the best atmosphere. Great happy hour prices. We've had a couple of things not come out as expected and the manager was more than happy to remake it. The few times I have ordered curb side I'm always in a rut bc I ALWAYS spill when eating in the car and there is never napkins in the bag, so if they were to put napkins in the bag instead of me having to walk around to the fountain that would be a plus! Also, both times I've ordered a bean and cheese burrito, the tortilla always splits opened! Other than those 2 things, we love it here!!"}
{"text":"Boca was good, I didn't realize it at first but I had actually been here before. We came during some training with a few guys and they had great things to say about the place. 

Once inside, you'll be taken over by the theme of the place. The service staff was really friendly and helpful too! You place your order at the front counter and then seat yourself. They will bring some chips and salsa, which are pretty good and will hold you over until your food gets there. 

We went a little crazy on the food but no regrets, it was all delicious. I got the loaded / stuff quesadilla entree and it was stuffed and messy of course. The beans and rice were good with it as well. Our friends got some tacos and a burrito and they all had good things to say about it. 

Overall, the location is nice and the staff is friendly. Once you know what you want get that order in, chow down on some chips and salsa, and be prepared to be stuffed when you leave because the food is delicious and there is a lot of it to go around!"}
{"text":"Friendly staff. Very clean. Good Margaritas. The food was just ok. There just wasn't enough flavor to anything. We ordered a carne asada plate, stuffed carne asada quesadilla, salmon salad and a fish taco."}
{"text":"We got take out food from this restaurant recently and it was amazing.  We had the shredded beef Macho Nachos for an appetizer and they were so filling I couldn't get to my chicken quesadilla. My kids ate the quesadilla and raved about it. These are now my favorite nachos of all time and I can't wait to get them again. I'm a 3rd generation AZ native so I've had my share of nachos! Loved the chips and salsa too. Everyone else loved their food from this restaurant as well. 

Love the location since theres not a lot of Mexican food restaurants close to where I live."}
{"text":"The place looks great and the food was really good. I had the chicken taco and tortilla soup. I thought it was going to be a light snack but was actually a full meal. Portions a hearty! You should check this place out."}
{"text":"I drove by this place everyday and finally decided to try it, I'm glad I did! I loved my steak and chicken tacos and there rice and beans are delicious. I did takeout a couple weeks later and they had my food  ready in less than 5 min! It was great!"}
{"text":"Not a fan. Over priced. Food had very little flavor. If your looking for good street tacos, I would stay away from this place. Just my personal opinion."}
{"text":"Thanks for opening a great mexican restaurant around here guys! Keep it up, we eat here at least once a week! Very clean resturant and the manager is a very nice guy."}
{"text":"Not a huge fan. Nice place, good ambience but the food was just okay. I was expecting something similar to a Barrio Queen but was let down. My family felt it was mediocre as well. Won't be a first or second pick for me"}
{"text":"They got my order correct and the food was good.  Love the chips and salsa.  The inside of the restaurant was clean and the employees were helpful helping me decide what to order since I had never been here before.  5 stars!"}
{"text":"Love this restaurant. We eat here a couple of times a month because the food is great, service is excellent I love the butternut squash soup, although the low-carb lettuce wraps are a strong second place for me.  We have been here several times and have had nothing but great experiences."}
{"text":"Boca is located right off Greenfield, the restaurant appeared to just hit rush our or a very lard crowd as went to look for a small table and none were clean.  The restaurant appears to have  just changed ownership or name change so don't get confused.  The restaurant had a traditional Latin vibe with colorful tiles throughout.

So I came for Taco Tuesday and it appears it only reflect on the price of the larger tacos not the taquitos or Cantina Tacos - so I ordered Cantina Tacos which were mighty tasty but I went to look for Salsa and found none.  The line to order was long and decided to go without."}
{"text":"Went there with a group of 5 from work.  They informed us it was taco Tuesday.  I thought Great, Taco's  it is.  I ordered the fish tacos. with rice and beans.

The place was pretty busy,  but it took our food longer than I thought it should. 

When it did arrive, some items were piping hot, while other items, like my fish tacos rice and beans were tepid at best, not to mention slightly greasy.   

The item that sealed the deal for me was a long blond hair which seemed to be cooked into the fish.  At that point I was done.

I pointed out the temperature and dangled the fish laden strand of hair up for the manager.  In which he apologized and offered to get me something more,  but I declined as my appetite was ruined.  He also took 20% off the bill.

I know they are fairly new at their location.  hopefully the temperature issues get solved as well as the hair issue.  Not sure I'm interested in going back"}
{"text":"Great food, nicely decorated. They have a great patio when the weather is nice. Beers and Margaritas, tacos, burritos, can't go wrong!!! There Happy Hour is Amazing!!! This is going to be a regular spot for sure."}
{"text":"This place is like an upscale filibertos with a bar. Lol. 

The bestie wanted to go to happy hour and check this place out since it was right by her work. I ordered the 3 taquitos, a purple rain and a watermelon margarita. The taquitos were very bland and dry. It doesn't even come with anything besides cheese. However the drinks were amazing! Really strong, and very good happy hour prices. 

I would probably come back for the drinks, I'm not sure about the food though."}
{"text":"In the brief month I've been in Arizona, I've explored a number of Mexican eateries.  Boca blew me away!  Gentleman at the counter was incredibly nice, thanked me for my service, got my food out to me quickly and the Diablo margarita he made was awesome!  The food is great and my chimichanga came out quickly!  I will DEFINITELY be returning regularly!!"}
{"text":"The salmon tacos as well as the rice and beans are delicious. The beef chimichanga was good as well. But would definitely return for the salmon tacos alone."}
{"text":"One star for the cold beer.  One star for the chips.  No other stars, for the rest of the meal or the salsa.   The counter guy did not know the menu, said there was only one vegetarian option, and failed to tell us about the rest of the stuff going on the taco.  Food was cold and would not have gotten my beer if I hadnt asked when the food was delivered.  Pricey for counter service.  Go somewhere else.   Will not return"}
{"text":"Fresh & tasty Mexican style food. Fast and inexpensive. Counter service. Clean. Friendly service."}
{"text":"This was my first time here and I will definitely come back. The staff is super friendly and the atmosphere is great. I would recommend this to anyone looking for good Mexican food!"}
{"text":"Favorite Mexican place in PHX. Beans are the best ever. It was the first thing I had when they opened and still addicted a year later. Never had a dish I didn't love. Great people, great service. Try the salmon...unreal."}
{"text":"We tried this place during their happy hour, and we really liked it! We got 2 chicken tacos & 2 steak tacos and the nachos. The nachos were just ok but we liked the tacos! Be sure to use the spicy salsa, which we didn't find very spicy but it adds a lot of flavor! They have a great beer selection also and the House margarita was decent! Definitely worth a try!"}
