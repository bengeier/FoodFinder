{"text":"Wow! Delicious Moroccan Fine Food, Amazing people will serve you! Very clean place and the decor will bring you to Casablanca! I do recommend to try the Chicken Tajine!"}
{"text":"I've been there with my friends few time there and it was great place to fresh food, tea is adorable, it was my first time to drink such a tea."}
{"text":"I've been a longtime user of Yelp but never comment - but feel compelled to help my fellow Yelpers here. 

Very disappointed and was so hopeful for a new spot in South Etobicoke.  

Food: slow to come and uneven- some hot some cold on the same plate?? Overall quality was poor, flavour missed and our orders came out of the kitchen 30 minutes apart - order went in at the same time.

Service - poor and awkward:  we weren't greeted when we entered, contemplated leaving and should have.  other customers came in and stood in the middle of the space, weren't greeted either.  Should have warned them. 

There was a dispute going on in the kitchen halfway through our meal and we were all but forgotten about - 

I really hope these folks pull it together but can't recommend this establishment on any level."}
{"text":"We ordered a variety of tagines and a kebab, all of it was delicious! My family and I have been to Morocco and it tastes exactly like you will get in the country. Brahim welcomed us very warmly, and his mint tea is a must! THIS IS A MUST TRY! Tr√©s bien!"}
{"text":"Great food
Great ambiance
Great hospitality
Great value

I have travelled numerous times to Morocco and can tell you that it is authentic.

Too bad it isn't closer to downtown, we'd be there weekly otherwise!"}
{"text":"The best morrocan food in town very tasty the service was excellent and the staff were so friendly the place is open for less than two weeks and we been there for three times already"}
{"text":"\"Once upon a time! few friends got together and felt like having some good Moroccan food. They found a place and some got lost on the way, but once they ordered pretty much most of the menu and tasted the food. Every one left happily ever after.\"

Okay lets get out of the fairyland get into the actual review. As mentioned earlier we went as a group. As we walked in we were hit by the Ambience of the restaurant. Although the place was not too big but the owner has spent some money to make us feel that we are sitting in Morocco.

Service was a little slow but I was expecting that as culture is to relax and enjoy the company plus the restaurant is new. The servers were very friendly, especially the owner Ibrahim. He was very good and shared his passion of food and explained how this restaurant came to being.

Now coming to the food, the menu was amazing and not just limited to Kababs like many Mediterranean restaurants out there.  So it was decided to \"order many and try each dish\" methodology. 

Ibrahim brought in the Moroccan Tea and that kicked us off to having an amazing experience. The tea was splendid!

For Starters, we ordered Harira Soup, Bissara Soup, Zaalouk warm Salad (made with eggplant) and Shakshuka. Some of the dishes came with their in house made bread. All the starters were amazing and we could get enough of them. 

For main course, we ordered Chicken Kabab, Tikka Kebeb, Merguex ( Lamb sausage), Lamb with Prunes, Moroccan Lemon Chicken, Beef Couscous and Chiken Tfaya Couscous. All the dishes were warm and tasty to the bone. The Grilled meat was marinated and grilled to perfection and was tender to eat. The other dishes were seasoned and cooked to perfection.  The inhouse bread was also two different kinds and delicious. 

Before we could get up to pay, Ibrahim stated he has dessert for us. We asked which one is this on the menu and he stated its not on the menu, they just made it. Let me tell you, it was to die for! 

The food was presented very well and the Morocco way. 

Overall, amazing experience and great food.

P.S for my Muslim folks - the food here is Halal."}
{"text":"I was so looking forward to go to this place till what happened here last night. 
My husband and I went here for dinner last night about 8:55 pm. We got there and the interior was nice and clean and seat urself dining. We got a table and the server came up right away to take our order. I told him we would need to see the menu before we order. He handed us the small pamphlet that was on the side of the table. We took a few minutes to order.
So I placed an order for the lemon chicken tagine (which came with bread) and my husband got the kaftan kabob. 
We got it fairly quickly. The pita bread was super hard and crunchy, which seemed a old. The lemon chicken was good but It seemed microwaved.  My husbands kafta kabob was
VERY small loaded with tons of cold rice. The Iftar was good but I was shocked by the portion. 
I was waiting for the server or the owner to
Come by and ask us how everything was, he did not.
So I went over and said to him, the food is good but the bread is very hard. I also mentioned the size of the kabobs. The owner was so offended and said to me \"what do you expect to get when you come here before closing!!?\" He went on saying i pay $6000.00 in rent and for the last three months have not made any money having this restaurant. The kafta kabobs are $9.99 so what do you expect to get for that price. I tried to calm the situation down and said no I am not trying to put ur restaurant down in anyway. But he refused to listen and went on saying next time you come you ll get fresh bread and to find a place that you can get kafta kabobs for $9.99. 
I didn't expect that kind of service nor did I expect to get dry hard bread if I went there before closing. The restaurant closes at 10 pm, and I was there around 8:55 pm.
I wish I could give this place another try but the man took my feedback the wrong way. Also, I don't want to go to a place where I was told because I am coming in towards the end of the day I get the leftovers to eat."}
{"text":"We were very excited to try this place after seeing so many good reviews. My husband and I love tagine and I've made it at home a couple of times. So We knew what to expect. We ordered the chicken breast kebab wrap, lamb prune tagine and harira soup. The wrap and soup were good but the tagine not so much. The pieces of lamb were big and mostly bones. The prunes seemed to be added after the cooking process when in fact they are usually cooked with the lamb. And the biggest disappointment was when I tried the lamb. It was cold... as in out of the fridge cold. We were told them at they were having a busy night and so perhaps it was served too soon. So we returned it and it was promptly removed from our bill. 

This showed very good customer service. The waitresses were amazing too. The chef would come around to talk to people at various tables. That was a good touch too. 

All in all we can understand the tagine mishap and will probably go back to give the place a second chance."}
{"text":"I love when a dining experience leads me to wikipedia, and this one falls in that category.
The sign says halal, which translates to \"allowed\" vs, things that are harem, or forbidden.
Morocco House is an experience for me that, while not quite making me convert to Islam, did make me see the world from their perspective with an epiphany moment that lasted over two hours. It all starts an incredible ice-breaker, the Moroccan hot mint tea.

From wikitravel here's a quote which sums it up:
\"Moroccan cuisine is often reputed to be some of the best in the world, with countless dishes and variations proudly bearing the country's colonial and Arabic influences.\"
No kidding! Everything was delicious!

And the best part was seeing the reaction on peoples faces when sampling this cuisine.
Packed with flavour and richness, it is obviously made by loving hands backed with eons of history and passion. 
It's not unusual to have a chef come out and greet diners, and it happens to most of us once in a while. But Hebraheam, the owner and chef, set himself apart from your average business owner with not only his depth and breadth of knowledge about Morocco cooking and dining, but he went back to the kitchen and started bringing out the ingredients he cooks with showing their authenticity to the spirit of the country. 
\"Smell this!\" he says, thrusting a packet of stock cube draped in Arabic script into my nose.
\"And look at this, all the best ingredients from my country\", he says pointing to a large tub of gorgeous camel-brown cumin. 
\"And try the olive oil!\" he says with exuberance. And he watched me pour the almost clear liquid from a huge 2L bottle onto some of his home made bread. It was unlike any olive oil I've had and tasted like I was eating fresh olives. Unbelievable! He has a connection with his Montreal friends where they bring in ingredients from Morocco and the taste throughout was clear evidence of something special.
There were eight of us so we each ordered something different planning to share it later (you can see where that's going). My beef with veg had a single olive in the middle. When I had that I could not get over the warmth of it, bring out a fantastic flavour that took time to savour and appreciate. One olive!

The items on the menu are all traditional Moroccan food which you can read about online, for example in the wikitravel blog but what sets this restaurant apart are the home cooked flavours.
Most of us have had typical middle eastern food, somewhat related, but cooked in an assembly line fashion where you get a dollop of rice, a spoon of meat or kebab, a squirt of savour sauce and then another of a garlic dressing on top. Placed on a bed of lettuce.
That is fine when you need to crank out food and make a profit doing it, but when you prefer to talk to your dining companions and savour some delicious tea, and minty cold water, I don't need someone to slap together a dish and serve it to me.
Instead I heard \"I'm getting goosebumps!\" and that was the second time! All from the taste and flavour alone. Lots of \"oohs and ahhs\" were heard throughout the meal.
We were marvelling at the dishes production while we waited too. 
\"Now that does NOT look like it came out of the freezer and microwaved\", I said, looking at the chicken/almond pie. 
\"How could Hebraheam pull that off while we waited\" along with all the other dishes that came out of the kitchen it seemed almost a miracle of cooking.

After realizing we had been sitting there almost two hours, the time spent including the entertainment moments with Hebraheam, the tea, the home made breads, the olive oil, all made for an incredible dining experience.

Watch the vid I made while sitting there which captures a sliver of the enthusiasm of the man.

Or some thing quick . They have very good Falafel sandwich , and merguez super duper yummy"}
{"text":"If I could give 0 if i could. Horrible experience, horrible service, uninterested staff. Food was bad. My husbands dinner didn't arrive until half an hour after my meal. One of the staff quit and walked out while we were there. No one greats you. No one gives a crap. We barely touched our meals and they couldn't care less. Will NEVER go back. And to the reviewer who said he felt like he was in Morocco has obviously never been there. This is a take out place. But now that we've ate there takeout is even off the table. So disappointed. We need new restaurants in Alderwood and I want the good ones to flourish. But this is not one of them."}
{"text":"Nicely decorated casual restaurant with excellent tagine! 

I had called the restaurant in advance to ask about their long weekend hours and if the meat was Halal - the person I spoke to (I expect the owner) was super friendly, engaging me in conversation and asking how I found the restaurant, etc. 

The restaurant was more casual than I anticipated - almost like a quick service joint in some ways, but with lovely Moroccon decor. 

We ordered the soup, pastille, and chicken tagine. The soup was hearty and served it's purpose of warming us up. The pastille was OK - I think it was well made in terms of the taste and crispiness of the shell, it just didn't suit my taste buds. The chicken tagine however was delicious and truly fall-off-the-bone as mentioned in a review I had read before coming. 

Will gladly visit again just for this tagine."}
{"text":"This is a place i'll definitely remember for the rest of my life as I had an amazing experience here!

I went with a large group of friends and we pretty much ordered everything on the menu, from the starters to mains(except sandwiches/desserts).

I don't know much about Moroccon food, but I can tell when the food is good, and boy was the food GOOD!

FOOD:
Everything we ordered was good, and flavourful.
The highlight for me was probably Chicken Lemon Tagine, Chicken Bastilla and Lamb With prunes.

Lemon Chicken Tagine($12) - Fall off the bone tender! intense flavour and large portions. This is something everybody would like, can't go wrong with ordering this one.

Chicken Bastilla - Chicken stuffed crispy pastries, I have never seen it happening before, Chicken and pastry is like made for each other.

Lamb with Prunes - I don't know how someone came up with this idea, but man was it a good idea. Again, something that sounds doesn't go together but the contrasting taste of lamb and prune was just PERFECT!

I loved the Shakshouka from the starters, but we ordered pretty much everything else on the starter menu and everything else was pretty solid as well!

The owner gave us desserts on the house and it was DELICIOUS!!! don't know the name of it sadly, and apparently the dessert menu is different every day.

Location and Decor:
Plaza appears to be uninviting and its a little harder to get into, it appears that there isn't a lot going on here so the place can easily be missed (hint - it's right after petro canada, google is wrong)

However, what you wouldn't expect is such a great environment inside, it would make you forget that you're sitting in Canada!
The place was decorated with Moroccon stuff, Owner was showing us the whole place and giving short stories about how he got everything from Morocco, including original paintings.

Service:
This is where the place lacks a little - service was extremely slow, there was a huge gap between starters and mains and we literally got hungry after finishing our starters and sitting for soo long. The place right now isn't equipped to deal with full house or a lot of people, as they are definitely under staffed. There was only one server and the rest was kitchen staff, and while the place may not need more than one server, that one server was also helping in the kitchen so there was technically nobody looking after the customers for a long time.

I understand that this place is in it's infancy, so it will take some time to figure things out, and I hope they figure it out because it wouldn't be cool if people miss out on this place because of their slow service.

TL;DR: Had an amazing experience, great ethnic food, lovely decor, very slow service. 10/10 would go again.

P.S Everything is halal here."}
{"text":"The chicken kebab was good.
Chicken tfaya extremely disappointing, looked like homemade crock pot concoction, minimal chicken, not good.  Overpriced."}
{"text":"this place is the hidden gem of browns line!! my family and i came in to order take out and they brought us some of the famous moroccan mint tea which was super sweet but refreshing. we got two types of soup, lamb and prune tagine, and lemon chicken. i would highly recommend the lemon chicken, it melted in my mouth and the flavours worked really well. the service was also great and friendly"}
{"text":"The first minute of walking in, I was greeted with a nice hello and a handshake from the chef! Great atmosphere, excellent food, so flavourful and tender. Had the Lamb Tajine and my friend had the Chicken Shawarma plate. Will be going back over and over."}
{"text":"The food was very good. Unfortunately we had to wait for 30 minutes for it because the new waitress had forgotten to register our order. The second waiter was very nice, as well as the chef / owner who is Moroccan."}
{"text":"Decided to try this place out as I was in area. Ordered a chicken plate and an additional kebob skewer. Once receive I was really disappointed. The quantity of chicken was extremely disappointing. Was totally not worth it. The extra beef kebob skewer as seen in plate was an extra $8? Seriously? I understand if it was $4 or so but the quantity was poor. The whole plate in picture with a mint tea costed me almost $25 and did not fill me up at all. However I must say the mint tea was really good but the service was not the greatest had to remind them about the mint tea I ordered as she forgot. Most likely will not come here again as you don't get what you pay for. The food was good but not worth the price you pay."}
{"text":"My friends and I had a gathering at Morocco House recently. We ordered so many things that I would rather list my general thoughts instead of describing dish by dish.  I must preface the review that I don't know much about Moroccan food.  Hence, I cannot attest to the authenticity of the food here; I could only speak to whether I like the experience or not.

TL DR version: Morocco House offers great food and excellent value.  The services is generally good and friendly, yet there is room for improvement in terms of speed of services.  Since the restaurant has barely opened for 2 weeks, it is still in its \"soft opening\" stage.  I am sure that once it has worked out some operational issues, it will become the gem that it is destined to be.  

Food: 
We had a few entrees, a few starters, 2 soups, 2 types of bread and a dessert.  We shared a bite of each other's dishes.  Everything, from bread to entrees, tasted from good to excellent.  My favourite dish was my own order, the Lamb and Prune Tagine.  The lamb meat was braised to perfection.  The flavours and spices were rich and balanced.  Even though it was made in advance, the food tasted relatively fresh.  The Merguez was my second favourite dish of the evening.  It didn't look too appetizing, but the appearance was grossly misleading.  The lamb sausages were so delicious, and the texture hit the right balance between lean vs moist.  Together with half a plate of salad, it was a rather healthy choice.  A friend who is knowledgeable with Middle Eastern sweets said the dessert was very good.  It didn't taste much to me, but I would take his seasoned opinion over mine.  I noted that everyone on the table said that they loved their entrees and wouldn't mind ordering them again in the next visit.  I took it meant that every dish tasted delicious.  Last and most definitely not least, the store-made garlic sauce was unreal.  You *must* have it.  I would rate the garlic sauce 6 stars out of 5 if I could.  5 stars overall.

Portion: Good portion.  You won't walk out hungry.  4 stars.

Moroccan Tea: 
Why a separate section for a tea?  Because I loved it.  I never had a Moroccan tea before, and I felt fortunate that this was my first experience.  It was a mild tasting green tea that tasted different from the Chinese green tea that I am used to.  It was served hot with a small slice of fresh mint leaf.  It tasted refreshing and \"clean\".  There was almost a feeling of tranquillity to it.  Kindly note that if you don't specify, it would be served sweetened.  You could ask for unsweetened tea.  Order it, and see if you enjoy it as much as I do.  5 stars.

Services:  
The waitress was friendly and helpful.  We asked to split bill at time of ordering, and she agreed without batting an eyelash.  I later found out that she did it without a computerized system, so kudos to her, and shame on venues that use a computerized system and still refuse to split bills.  The owner was passionate and proud of his Moroccan heritage and his food (he was the chef).  He came by at the end of the meal to explain the food, the ingredients, etc..  It was quite an enjoyable chat.  4 stars.

Speed of services: 
The place was opened for less than 2 weeks.  There had to be kinks to work through somewhere.  And speed of services was one of them.  It took an hour for our food to arrive.  I completely understood that our table ordered a lot of different things, so it was complicated to cook for us.  I did feel a bit antsy towards the end of the wait.  Of course I forgot all about it once I saw how good the food was, which was the most important part at the end of the day.  I didn't try, but you can try calling in your take out order in advance to save some wait time.  I hope that Morocco House can improve on the speed of services after a while.  2 stars

Decor:
The strip mall is completely divey.  I wouldn't have thought of stopping by if I didn't have a referral to visit this restaurant.  The storefront of the restaurant didn't look much either, despite the owner trying his best to polish the look.  However, and this is a big one, the interior of the restaurant is newly renovated.  Not overly fancy, yet much thought has gone into the lighting, the tapestries, the wall arts, etc..  The decor and ambience scream culture and heritage.  It feels nice to dine in here.  The ordering counter looks like it caters to take out ordering.  But this is a mild distraction at most and does not diminish the ambience.  4 stars.

In conclusion, would I return?  Oh yes.  Am I a fan?  You bet.  Will I recommend others to patronize?  I am doing just that with this review."}
{"text":"Good authentic ambience, with tons of choices. Limited menu items for vegetarians - mostly meat based dishes. The shakshuka was delicious and I wish they had that in a meal size. I had the falafel platter and that was decent. My friends had the lamb sausage and the lemon chicken, both of which were good. They did find the portions to be a bit on the smaller size for the meat. Prices aren't bad - we spent under $20 per person. 
PS: Mint tea is a must try!"}
{"text":"Oh my goodness... This is the best Moroccan food I've ever had. I was in Morocco a couple of years ago and eating here made me feel like I was back there again. So good. The beef tagine with peas was beyond good. The chicken tagine was also great, and a close second to the beef. The mint tea, served in traditional glass cups, was perfect. This place is a real treat. Will most definitely return."}
{"text":"Went there Sunday May 27, 18. with a friend, she ordered the lamb Tajin and I ordered chicken Kabab dish. 
The waiter polite Turkish lady with some arrogant young guy.
Brought my Oder which I counted 5 prices of tiny chicken on rice and salad! Too small as a meal.

My friend got her order (Tajin) which was a huge bone with some pees. My friend and I both tried to find anything eatable other than the pees! We could not.

I would never go there again."}
{"text":"Second visit to this little gem of a restaurant.  With four people during this dinner visit (prior visit was a lunch) we had the opportunity to taste many wonderful dishes. Before I get into the dishes, overall it was a great experience. Food and service were both excellent and the value really is quite amazing.  

Now onto the dishes...

Casablanca salad:  had a very nice taste. Like a mild fatoush salad without the crisps. 

Marakesh salad:  beets with some other stuff.  Tasty but I probably wouldn't order again even though I do like beets. Not bad but not a standout. 

Moroccan Lemon chicken Tagine:  pretty good chicken pieces on the bone with a nice flavour. 

Beef with vegetables tagine:  very tender beef with a very nice rich sauce. 

Chicken Bastilla:  this pastry filled with minced chicken, and eggs and almond was amazing!  The owner made one for himself and one for us. He said it was a dish for kings and I would agree wholeheartedly. I would come back wearing a crown just for this dish!  While everything was very good, this was next level!  

Moroccan Tea with the meal and some of the tasty desserts really rounded out the meal. 

And for my non-dairy friends, dairy is used sparingly and they were careful to make sure I was safe. 

Visit this family friendly restaurant and feel what great authentic dining in Morocco is like without the costly flight!"}
{"text":"So I ate here last night with 2 other people.  Did not know what to expect, but was pleasantly surprised.  The space is clean and well decorated without being over-the-top.  The smells as soon as you walk in are mesmerizing.  The food itself is authentic Moroccan food....extremely flavorful and visually appealing.   We were waited on by the owner/chef....super friendly and personable.  I would recommend this place to anyone visiting the west end of Toronto, just make sure you make reservations for Friday-Sundays.  I cannot wait to go back and try something new."}
{"text":"Service - Pretty close to a 5*.  Quite attentive and hospitable!  They do take their time in terms of collecting empty plates, ordering, and at times, delivery of food.  Atmosphere is more relaxed and there is no need to rush out.

Food - Is like a 3-3.5*, based on what I had which was the Merguez (sausage) plate.  I ordered this based on another Yelper's review.  Sausages were tasty, but it was sort of out of proportion to the rest of the plate.  The sausages sat on top of waaay too much rice and the other half of the giant plate was an ok-salad.

Highlights:  Moroccan mint tea ($1.50) and the flat bread that's crusty on the outside.

Rice was also cold, so I couldn't eat it.  I didn't want to bother staff to reheat it since I was semi-full, so I just ended up packing it up.  

I also shared the Zaalouk Warm Salad with my friends.  It was good too.  Overall, food is more home cooking as nothing was over salted.  

My friends ordered the Lamb with Prunes ($12) that had this interesting raisin, prune, and caramelized onions and Moroccan Lemon Chicken ($12), both were served in tagines.  These dishes had more interesting and different flavours that aren't common.  I'd definitely  recommend these 2 dishes before the sausages 'cause it just literally tasted like 3 small-medium sausages on a koobideh (Persian) rice.  Again, I couldn't eat that much of it 'cause it was cold.

Prices are GOOD though and portions.  They just hafta work on the proportions of carbs vs. protein."}
{"text":"Very good Moroccan food. Owner Ibrahim takes great pride in what he's serving. The menu is quite interesting and almost 50% of the menu is served in a tagine. Nice touch, especially since they're not cheap either. 
 
It would be nice to see some more vegetarian dishes added, but that shouldn't stop you from going and having an excellent meal for a very reasonable price.

Expect things to be a little slow service wise, so leave your Toronto stress at the door if you do go. The decor will definitely transform you a bit. Order a mint tea for while you wait. It's perfect for a lazy weekend day in between errands."}
{"text":"If you're looking for good food, this is the place to go. Service is amazing, the setting is intimate. The meat tastes amazing, the lamb was super tender.

Hummus has a very nice kick to it, and the soup is to die for.

Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"I have the chicken bastilla. It was for a good price and a good portion.
I would recommend it"}
{"text":"This place just opened today and I was their second customer.

Ambience is perfect. The furniture and the music make you feel like you're in Morocco.

The owner is a passionate fella so be ready for a mini lesson on Moroccan food and what makes it unique! I loved it. He will also make you feel very welcome and at home.

Now on to the most important part: the food. My God. It was amazing. I ordered the Lemon Chicken Tagine. I got a warning from the owner that it may take some time because it's usually served for dinner (I went for lunch). But the food was ready within 10 minutes. In the meanwhile, I got served complimentary fresh bread, olives, and eggplant spread, which was all quite delicious. The tagine itself was amazing. The lemon is preserved for a month in-house so it's edible and has a really nice flavor. The chicken itself was fall-apart tender and packed with flavor too. The owner also gave me some garlic sauce (also made in-house) and garlic potatoes to sample. Both were equally as delicious. Overall, the food is a solid 9 out of 10.

I'm tempted to give this place a 5 out of 5 but I'm gonna try it a few more times and then update my review."}
{"text":"The food was delicious and the time it took to make it speedy!  But I didn't get what I ordered, I got half a tea and I was WAY over charged. They're a wonderful family owned restaurant just trying to make a living but customer satisfaction is important and they must step the game up."}
{"text":"How many stars would you give to an establishment where you would not want to go a next time nor recommend to any of your friends?  

We ordered 2 kofta kebab rolls and a soup. The soup was just OK. The rolls or sandwiches were a real disappointment. 

The quantity of kofta kebab can't be described as the main item. It's more like you are having lettuce and pita bread!"}
{"text":"I was with my wife and we ordered the trio appetizer which came with tomato sauce and egg (shakshuka), hummus, and eggplant (zaalouk) and you dip these all with pita. As our entree we got the chicken tagine and the beef couscous. We enjoyed the couscous more so. It was a slow cooked beef on couscous and it was delicious and hearty. The chicken tagine was different. It was similar to a slow roast chicken in stew and olives. It had an interesting taste and it had a strong hint of olives."}
{"text":"Morocco House deserves nothing less than a full 5 stars! I went with a friend for lunch and we split a merguez sandwich as well as a kofta sandwich. One bite in, we were blown away. No, seriously, I was wondering what plane touched down bearing gifts directly from Morocco. 

So, hey - too good to be true right? I'm not going to write a review because I loved this place the first time. 

Four of us returned together to get the full experience. We walked in and sat down at the booth table and were greeted right away by the owner who said, 'welcome'! 

He offered to make some suggestions for starters and seeing that it was a hot day he suggested the Casablanca salad and a beet salad which he asked the cook to get started on right away. 

Ibrahim then suggested the chicken tagine, beef tagine and the bastille.

The food came so quickly and it was INCREDIBLE!! The salads were fresh and delicious, the meat in the tagine was tender and flavourful - aroma and flavour that could only be achieved by a slow braise. The garlic sauce and harissa were just like the market in Marakesh. We had the mint tea with dinner and it was soooooo good. 

For desert, the owner said he would bring us an assortment and at this point we just said ....., 'Ibrahim....do whatever you want .....we're in Moroccan heaven!'

My final grade
Service: 10/10
Food: 10/10
Ambiance: 9/10
Overall return score 10/10

I absolutely will be back and will be recommending this place to my friends. 
Ps. My photos don't do justice to the amazing food. Just go here, eat here, you will be more than satisfied."}
{"text":"My FIRST Moroccan food!

The shashuka was spectacular.  Lots of tomatoes, garlic and cilantro!  With an egg on top.  My only complaint is that the pita wasn't warmed up!

Moroccan mint tea is soooo good!  Next time I'll definitely be ordering a pot! 

I had the lamb tagine for dinner.  The Lamb shank was fabulous... Fall off the bone tender.

The music is fantastic... Very Latin!  But not too loud, so you can still carry on a conversation! 

NO room for dessert .  Maybe next time!

Except.

They gave me a piece of almond money orange blossom cake....warmed up!  OMG!    

And I bought some baklava to take home....I mean, why not!"}
{"text":"one thing that stood out to us; was how dirty the place was. We got served in dirty dishes and the glasses weren't washed. We asked for re-washed dishes and it came out looking pretty much the same. The food has gone down in quality and tbh getting past how dirty this place was a challenge. It made us question in what conditions the food was being prepared. I would not recommend this place."}
