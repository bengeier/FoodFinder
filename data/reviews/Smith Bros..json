{"text":"Pros: the server was  very nice and accommodating that's the one star. Nice decor gets another star. 

Cons: the reception girl on the phone kept interrupting my one quick question and rushing for name and phone number because apparently it gets packed after 6pm on Friday. Looking at good Yelp reviews we thought she must be right. When we arrived there at 8pm hardly half the tables were taken- Wow! I had a simple question about a particular drink and she misinformed about the availability . On top of that we couldn't finish some of the food specially artichoke dip. I guess they care about only 1 visit per customer."}
{"text":"Went to Smith Bro.s on the suggestion of my customer.  It was a Friday night, around 7pm, the four of us.  We were greeted and seated promptly sans reservations in a friendly manner by the hostess and Ryan, which we find out later he is one of the managers.
First, the customer service.  Our server was Claudia.  Top notch service throughout until the end...and that these days is rare my friends... bread that was offered whenever we ran out.  Water cups upsized for us for the ones that didnt drink alcohol, extra utensils for sharing, made sure there was sufficient sauces all round.  And all this without even having us to ask for it! 
I just wanna take this moment to say \"THANK-YOU CLAUDIA\" for serving us. If everyone had YOUR attitude & efficiency other restaurants would be making a lotta money.
Okay, now to the food.  We ordered:

sirloin steak w/ bacon bourbon sauce 
rib eye w/ mushroom sauce
striploin w/ peppercorn sauce
panko fried shrimp match stick fries
beer Sampler
brownie w/ ice cream

I'll simply summarize our food.  Steaks were nicely done AS PER how you like. they\"re quit on the mark with this. Served with a generous amount of yummy fluffy mashed potatos.  The sauces were nice as well.

The panko fried shrimp, nice & crispy, fair amount & served temperature hot.  Served with the lil matchstick fries .... which I would've enjoyed them a bit more crispier. (little soggy chefs)

Don't forget the bread, because of this light crispy crust & warm soft centre, it made me compare it with another popular steak restaurant & I can say NO comparison. Smith Bro.'s  please do not change this bread or the nice butter that it comes with.

In terms of beer, hoping to see maybe Stella, Flying Monkey's, Guinness ....just suggesting.  :)

The brownie. What can I say \"YUMMY\"!. More cake-like than all that sugary fudgy stuff. A scoop of red pralines ice on top to finish.

The reason for dropping a star is because of \"NO MORE PRIME RIB\", the usual item I order at steak restaurants, & they're out. It was Friday & only 7pm, quit early to be running out, meanwhile over hearing the table next to us wanted it as well.  Can we maybe provide more prime rib on the weekends perhaps & keep the patrons happy?? . Thank you."}
{"text":"Been meaning to come here for a while now since this place has such good reviews. So decided to come here with the BF for my birthday on a Wednesday at the beginning of August. Got there at 8:15pm and was disappointed to learn that the prime rib platter had already sold out, which was what I wanted to try. 

Saw that they had a Why Wait Wednesday prix fix menu, $50 for 2 people, you get an appetizer to share, 2 mains, and a dessert to share. For our appetizer we went with the Spinach and Artichoke Fondue. Instead of getting 2 separate mains, we got the Carved N.Y. Striploin for Two to share. And a Crème Brulee for our dessert.

They brought out some nice warm bread right after we ordered. It came with whipped butter. Yay! Warm crusty bread with whipped butter, I loved it! The Spinach and Artichoke Fondue was really good. They came with homemade tortilla chips, which I found a little too oily. Our Striploin for Two was 16oz, and came with sautéed mushrooms and a small mountain of garlic mashed potatoes. It comes with our choice of 2 sauces, so we chose the Peppercorn Cream and the Mushroom Cabernet. The beef was cooked to our liking of medium-rare, but since the steak was so big the outer sections were cooked more medium almost medium-well than medium-rare. We also found it slightly drier than we liked. Guess that's why you get the sauces. The BF liked the Mushroom Cabernet while I preferred the Peppercorn Cream. The Crème Brulee was huge! But the burnt sugar on top were unevenly distributed and parts of it were a little too thick, making it hard to eat. The portions were good, we're weren't super hungry so we couldn't finished the mashed potatoes, and had to take half of the fondue to go 

They had an open kitchen, where I took peeks at while we waited for our food, but that wasn't for long cause we got our bread and appetizer fairly quickly. Overall environment was very causal and I really liked the way they decorated the place. The washroom didn't seem to match the rest of the restaurant though. Our server was attentive, coming back to check on us after every dish he brought out, but man that guy doesn't ever smile!

The food was good overall, portions were good for the price. Its a little far from us, so not sure if its good enough to be worth a drive up here just for it, but a definite good choice if you happen to be in the area. I'll still probably come back again to give the prime ribs a try though. Our server told us that they make a limited amount of the prime rib on weekdays so they are usually gone before 7pm. They make more on weekends and typically last until 9pm or even closing. Maybe I'll have better luck next time now!"}
{"text":"Decent steak but not as good as what I expected.  Especially after hearing from friends.   I had the new york strip and it was ok. Service was great though. I say it's on par with Keg or slightly worse overall. 
One more thing, the it's an open kitchen so the smell of the steaks fill the air. This can be a good thing but can also stink up your clothes afterwards. Take that into consideration."}
{"text":"Amazing steakhouse located in Scarborough. We went here last night for my mothers birthday and we all loved it, the waitress was very friendly and prompt. My moms steak was a little under cooked at first but the server quickly rectified the problem and made sure the rest of our experience that night was great. The steak is delicious and the fries/mashed potatoes are also really good. We've been waiting for a good restaurant to come out near us and we finally found one."}
{"text":"TL;DR - Great alternative for a steak dinner outside the Keg. Same ambiance and atmosphere. Not outstanding service but good food, menu options and great value.

---

I was pleasantly surprised by my visit to Smith Brothers a few weekends ago on the Saturday night before Thanksgiving.  My friend made reservations at 7pm and I didn't even think that was necessary because there were plenty of tables open.  I would say that given the size of the restaurant, you can easily seat more but there's a lot of space between you and the next table and it was only 70% full on a Saturday night.  There's plenty of parking like you wouldn't believe (it's also not downtown mind you) and my only gripe is that since it's my first time coming, you honestly CANNOT see the restaurant when you're driving down either Eglinton or Warden (at night) unless you know what to look for.  It's in a plaza and the store logos/signs at the front don't list Smith Bros. so you'll have to drive in just to look for it.

Service for the most part is decent. Not outstanding (as people mentioned) but not atrocious either.  Our waitress forgot a few things and we had to remind her but she was also serving a large party + small tables.  I'll give her the benefit of the doubt but she also didn't check-up on us while we were eating either and I really wanted more water.  

Our order:
Tableside Guacamole - We got it not spicy and the girl came back to physically smash the avocados and ingredients together beside us.  I felt so bad for her because the avocados weren't that soft and she was clearly very awkward and struggling to stand there for a solid 3-4 mins doing this.  We offered to take it away from her and continue mixing ourselves...My other complaint were the chips.  I thought they would be baked and they're not - they're fried.  AND SO SALTY! I actually just put the guac on my bread instead.
Prime Rib Platter - My friend got the prime rib meal and it comes with a huge assortment of stuff.  Very large portions and definitely took a lot of that home. We got it rare and it came rare.  What else could you ask for?  I also love yorkshire pudding so double win! 
Caesar Salad w/ Sirlion - I got a salad because I'm a pansy when it comes to eating a lot.  The sirloin was 7oz and I couldn't even finish it.  The salad was typical... but fresh lettuce and croutons.  The sirloin wasn't as good as the prime rib but still came out tender and rare. 

Overall, our bill came out to $63 before tax and tip for 2 people. For a steakhouse, I think that's a decent price (close to the Keg) and we were stuffed - couldn't even get dessert. Plus we had leftovers.  I would definitely come back and perhaps get the all-you-can-eat mussels which everyone says is worth it.  I would also try their other steaks or apps since they're reasonable priced.  The atmosphere is cozy and family-like and great as an alternative for \"affordable\" steak dinners.  Considering that it's not overly crowded either, I would make another trip here purposefully."}
{"text":"Great Food & Service.  Very Polite staff, attention to details.  Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"very family styled decor not what i expected.  service was very attentive and good.  prime rib was excellent... also liked the fact that there's a yorkshire pudding,  nicely done!"}
{"text":"Decoration: nice, classy and give me a warm feeling
Server: fast and friendly
Food: the bread they bring you during the wait time is really nice: hot, crunchy outside and super soft inside.I tried the tavern burger with chips. The burger was huge and all but it wasn't tasty; it was average overall. The chips is however horrible, I couldn't figure out what they were trying to archive with it. The small size made it absorb too much oil and the result was soggy.
Price: Average, about 15-30 per person."}
{"text":"This area brings back memory, as back then in Scarborough to find good eats is usually not there, unless you go to Mandarin buffet or something. This place use to be Tucker's Market place, but it no longer exist and is now a steakhouse! I like how this place is new, and not another Keg or Canyon Creek or other franchise players we've seen.

We went there with 5 ppl on thursday at 7:30pm and it was half full I'd say. The place has an open kitchen and the setting is casual dine atmosphere. The light is a bit dim, but that is usually how it is at steakhouse. 

My lil bro got the ayce mussels with shoe string fries for $18 which is a great deal. If I ate that, I would go for bowls and bowls. They actually give you a great size portion bowl. My lil bro ate two full bowls so that's money well spent.

My Mom got the Fired Grilled Shrimp skewers with a Giant Broccoli $18 b/c she didn't want rice pilaf. This dish is alright, and nothing too special to mentioned about.

My Gf got the steak and potato soup to start. It was a bit salty to her liking. The main was a 7oz striploin with shoestring fries and she thought it was alright.. 

My Dad got the 10oz ny striploin with mash potato with crumble bacon sauce which he enjoyed. The app was a salad which is normal stuff.

I got the same except with mushroom cabernet sauce. I did request for medium, but got medium well, and when the Manager came by and asked is everything cooked to our liking, I shamelessly just nodded my head politely. The steak is nice bbq food the way they grilled it, but the cooking method is not the tastiest of steaks. 

BTW my gf, Dad, and myself got the 'Complete Deal' which gives you one app, one entree, one dessert for a set price.

For desserts we tried one of each: Creme Brulee (nice size) and tasted good, but not the best. Fresh Apple Cobbler which is a warm dessert that tasted good too, but the greates. And the Triple Chocolate Brownee which surprisingly was not uber sweet and had ice cream on top.

All in all enjoyable dinner for 5 ppl at the price of $145 before tips...Would I consider going back...Yesh, I would because its a steakhouse in Scarborough!!!"}
{"text":"This is a hidden gem in Scarborough! Growing tired of the usual chains, so I gave Smith Bros a chance after reading some positive reviews. This place is well worth a visit. The food was fantastic. I had the prime rib dip and my friend had the sirloin steak...both delicious and great value for money. The service was impeccable. I think I might be a regular now!!"}
{"text":"Came in on a Wednesday afternoon and the steak was delicious.

Good value for your dollar, would definitely recommend over The Keg."}
{"text":"Let me start off with how good the service was; the receptionists, servers and even the manager were really nice and they always made sure our water cups were filled! Now, on to the food. I came here with my family (four people) and we ordered two rib-eyes, one prime rib platter and one New York striploin. The size of the steaks were huge and enough to fill us up, along with the sides. We also ordered a side of mushroom for two. The rib-eyes were not seasoned enough; I needed to add more salt onto it in order to get it down. The prime rib on the other hand, fantastic! It's really tender, while the rib-eye was a bit more chewy for my liking. The striploin was kind of dry, even though we ordered medium-rare. The mushrooms were...mushrooms; can't really go wrong with them. We also ordered the tap samplers and they were perfect for sampling! I would give another four taps a try again. Lastly, we ordered the cheesecake and chocolate ice cream for dessert. The cheesecake tastes more like a mousse and the ice cream was too sweet for me, but good for those with a sweet tooth. All in all, would come back and try the mussels next time!"}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped in here impulsively tonight to give it a try.  He's often disappointed by steaks when we eat out -- not cooked to his liking, small portions of lesser quality than the price would suggest, etc.  We were both pleasantly surprised by our experience tonight and will definitely return.

Our server was amazing - very attentive, friendly and helpful, pacing the meal from ordering to the bill just right.  Management also stopped by the table to ensure all was to our liking.

We had the tableside guacamole, which was excellent, although the house made tortilla chips were a slight bit greasy.  The seasonal soup, a shitake and portabello mushroom, was absolutely delicious and loaded with mushroom chunks.

We both ordered the seafood steak, medium rare.  My husband, who is more particular, said it was a perfect medium rare.  I found it slightly too red for my liking, but I've only recently begun enjoying it anything but medium well and admittedly squick over rare meat.  My advice: if you want your steak just pink (not bright pink/red), or are used to what typically passes for medium rare and is really somewhere between medium rare and medium, order medium at this place.  It'll be more what you're looking for.

For dessert, we had ice cream (very nice and decadent) and the creme brulee (tasty and very good, but not a standout).

Overall, we were very satisfied with the value for our meal, and really enjoyed our main course.  Recommended!"}
{"text":"Spoiler: Nothing more to say then great steak.

Atmosphere & service: very clean cozy steakhouse. Lots of different areas. U can be in well lit rooms or dimly lot rooms for a different mood. Waiter was good. Came back to refill my drinks without being asked. Got all of our orders (20ppl) correct and didn't ask us to pass down drinks or food. He was just very quiet and unmemorable.

Food: the appetizers we ordered include spring rolls. Nachos with spinach dip, pot stickers, beef skewers. The latter 2 items tasted just OK. I definitely wouldn't order the beef skewers again. The new York strip was cooked like I ordered and tasted delicious ( others got the rib eye and steak and sandwiches). Desert was creme brulee and rasberry cheese cake both were good"}
{"text":"Since it opened we have gone there at least once a month. They know how tocook succulent steaks, especially prime rib and striploin. Their signature steak sauces are good, but really not necessary. I also like the steak and mushroom pie. The Pommie's apple cider is local and very good; a nice alternative to wine or beer. Always good service!"}
{"text":"Been wanting to try this place for awhile now and after all the positive reviews  was pumped. 

The decor and atmosphere of the place was nice and gave that relaxing feel. Place was clean and we'll taken care of.

Got here around 8 pm on a Friday and was seated immediately. It was not too busy which was surprising.

Server, forgot his name, was knowledgeable, polite and efficient. Their menu is not massive,  like Pickle Barrel, but had all the \"important\" stuff...steak!!

GF and I are not hard core beer fans but we tried out the sampler (flight of 4 for $7). Half our choice and the other half recommendation. I also like that they write down which beer is which so you know what you're drinking.

GF ordered the Completes NY strip, which comes with app, main and dessert, and I ordered the rib eye. Wanted the prime rib but they were already sold out.

The sour dough bread came out scalding hot with whipped butter which was very good.

The app of PEI mussles, big portion for $10, were very good although would prefer more broth with it.

Steaks came out perfect med rare and was very tender and juicy. Sides, baked potato and mashed,  were also very good. The mashed was very creamy and the sour cream on my baked was very creamy and not too overpowering. 

The waiter always checked on us but was never pushy and even the manager came over to make sure everything was alright.

I will definitely be coming back and recommending to others. Only thing I would like is extended hours but I guess the area does not justify it.

Note: was hungry and the steaks looked so good didn't get a chance to take a pic!"}
{"text":"4/5 stars 
I went to Smith Bros for the very first time, and it was a pleasant experience. I did attend with a party of 15, so it was indeed very large. I ordered the beef pot pie, which I would rate 3.5-4.3. The pastry was not underneath. The inside of a pie was pretty much a stew beef. It didnt have vegetables or even onions. And It came with a side of mashed potatoes, which was real potatoes not a mix. Consistency/ texture was smooth but had a few lumps throughout. I did ask the waitress to switch my mash with the seasonal soup while ordering but because it was a large group, i understood the confusion. 
The matchstick fries were depressing. Crunchy but if i want fries, it shouldn't be hickory sticks! 
Ambience: ill lit. The lighting made me look terrible, so definitely dont take a first/blind date here. Good service. 
Restaurant was clean, bathroom was clean. 
Great experience."}
{"text":"I was really excited to check this place out. I've heard great things, and I am a steak aficionado. I had a less than stellar experience, along with a co-worker I was having a work dinner with. 

-First, our waitress, was absolutely rude and seemed annoyed by us the entire time we were there. 
-We both ordered the 'complete' meal. I chose the caesar salad to start and my friend chose the house salad. Both were lackluster and had no flavour whatsoever. Each of us went with the NY Striploin and matchstick fries. When the steaks arrived(without a steak knife x2), my friends steak was twice the size of mine. How could that be? We ordered the exact same thing. Both steaks were tough and cooked more than medium rare(we both ordered medium rare). The only saving grace was decent sauces on the side. The matchstick fries were alright, but, basically seemed more like hickory sticks from the convenience store. Dessert was meh.
-It was thirsty Thursday, we opted in for it. We were really interested to hear what the beermaster had to say. He was eating when we came in, the waitress advised he'd come over after...Well, that never happened, the guy just split.

Pros: Nice layout, cozy place. Lot's of room to move around 
Cons: Bad service, food was sub-par for the price

I'll come back...if someone else pays.

Sorry Brothers, you guys really let me down."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I decided to treat ourselves to a steak dinner for our birthdays. We usually go to the Keg, but will likely return here over the Keg in the future. Steaks were great. Service was fantastic. Really nothing to complain about. Will definitely consider upping this to a 5 star in the future.

Made a reso for 7:30, but showed up about 45 mins early on a weekend. They quickly accommodated us after taking our drink orders in the lounge. Food came out in a reasonable time. The matchstick fries are fantastic, and the choice of house-made steak sauces was a nice touch. The wine menu was fairly decent, and they had a wide variety of craft beers on tap, all of which $6/7 a pint. Can also get a sampler of 4x5oz beers for the same price as a single pint, which was a great deal. Seeing as it was both of our birthdays, the server offered us each a birthday brownie (on the house). I had it. It was pretty good, and a real portion, not sized down because it was free. The girlfriend opted for another dessert option, and the server was kind enough to take it off our bill as well. Overall great experience. Will definitely go back over going to the Keg."}
{"text":"Had steak with the match stick fries!! loved it.. ordered medium .. which was cooked perfectly.... next time, will order it medium rare... husband had the burger and he loved it! Will definitely go back again!"}
{"text":"Bland food, poor service, this place is nothing special. The manager is rude and only seems to pay attention to certain types of people. I've experienced this on a few occasions"}
{"text":"Ordered a medium rare sirloin steak but was undercooked, disappointed. Staff was great though but felt like I was at Swiss chalet."}
{"text":"Great value for the price point,  the steak was much better than I had expected, this place is perfect for a family night out for nice steak dinner without a huge price tag."}
{"text":"I came here on a Saturday night with another couple. 
We were seated and waited ten minutes before the server came over with water. She let us know where the washrooms were located (always helpful to know!), but then left without asking if we wanted anything to drink to start off with.

Fifteen minutes passed by before she came back for our order. The drinks were brought out, but they forgot the bread... We had to ask for it. 

Appetizers: spring rolls and spinach dip. You know when you eat a bag of chips and the closer you get to the bottom of the bag, the more broken up the chips are? That's what the spinach dip chips looked like. We flagged down a manager because we didn't see anyone else and he brought out replacement chips. He checked in on us later to see how the meal was going which was nice of him. 

Mains: prime rib dinners ordered all around. The prime was on par with milestones and the keg.

Other notes: there was an extra place setting that was left on the table. Empty plates were not removed in a timely manner so it was a little awkward. 

Overall, the food was okay, and service friendly enough, but I would not go back because it's quite a distance from home and the Keg is only two minutes away."}
{"text":"Everything here was excellent. Our steaks were really tasty and everyone enjoyed their meal. The service was great!
We will be back"}
{"text":"Came here with my gf and had a great dinner. Bread so fresh you could see the steam coming off it. Went well with a huge bowl of mussels for 10 bucks! We also ordered the shrimp appetizer which was not bad either. We got the prime rib to share and even though it was one portion between the 2 of us, we were stuffed. Service was on point too, maybe we're just easy to please but we had zero complaints about this place... I like it, I like it a lot. We'll be back fo sho."}
{"text":"We went to Smith and Bros. for my boyfriends birthday. We were instantly greeted by a friendly face and sat at a booth. 

Our server was Gabrielle, she was very nice and was very knowledgeable about their menu and she was very courteous and went above our needs. She was quick and very attentive to our needs.

My boyfriend ordered NY Striploin with the peppercorn cream and mashed potatoes which also came with a soup and dessert (he picked mixed berry cheesecake) and I opted for the unlimited mussels with unlimited matchstick fries and a sizzling mushroom pan. The steak was made perfectly and that peppercorn sauce was the perfect match for his steak and the mashed potatoes was equally delicious. My mussels were fresh but I have to give it up to the matchstick fries...those things are dangerous and addictive. I could have honestly gone for a second round but I was stuffed. The portions were good for the price we paid. They also gave him a free birthday brownie which was baked fresh and it came with vanille ice cream. 

They also had this promotion in which you buy any beer on their menu and you got to keep the Smith and Bros. beer mug it came in. 

Overall, we enjoyed our first experience their and enjoyed the meal. We will certainly be back to this place."}
{"text":"Their tavern burger is juicy and really good. The matchstick fries is a really good complement to the burger."}
{"text":"Ordered from the dinner menu, Completes - Seasonal soup, Sirloin, and Double Chocolate-Orange Mousse for $25.

I'm usually not a steak fan, but I decided to give this place a try and loved it! Steak was amazing, creamy garlic mashed potatoes were delicious, and the portions fill you up quick. The soup and dessert were great and they also serve you fresh warm bread with butter to start.

The restaurant itself is clean, well-decorated, and makes you feel comfortable and relaxed. Service is excellent.

Will be bringing friends here soon!"}
{"text":"Came here with three friends to celebrate a birthday. Made reservations using the Open Table app and was seated promptly after we arrived. I was surprised to get a table reserved as it was a Friday night, but it was a long weekend so could have been that most people were out of town. We ordered some beer from Smith Bros Draught section of the menu. Our waiter seemed very disorganized and all over the place because our drinks came much later and were already warm by the time we started drinking (little bit of a let down there - hate warm beer). I'm almost certain it was the waiter's fault and not the bar because one of my friends showed up 10 minutes after we ordered our drinks and his drink came the same time as ours, so it's likely that our beer was sitting at the bar waiting to be relocated to our table. At our table, we ordered two orders of the Prime Rib, an order of the Filet Mignon, and an order of the New York Striploin for the mains. For appetizers, we ordered Firecracker Shrimp and the PEI Mussels, both of which were very good. The mains were done perfectly as my Prime Rib was seasoned and cooked properly (medium rare - as all beef should be cooked). I was also pleasantly surprised that there was little fat on my Prime Rib which was great because I've been many places that give you \"12 oz.\" to end up with only about 6 oz. of edible meat. The sides that came with my entrée were also very good as the mashed potatoes were very creamy and the Yorkshire Pudding was light and fluffy. Everything was great with one exception; service was unbearably slow at times and it could've have just been our server as the restaurant was busy but not full by any means. As a result, I had to give this restaurant four stars; otherwise, it would've been five."}
{"text":"2 Stars for Service. No stars for food.

I had the rib eye. It looks great in the picture I posted and was cooked to a perfect medium rare as requested but it was super thin and didn't have any flavour. I'm usually a traditionalist and don't put any sauce or gravy on my steak but I actually added table salt to my steak. I was willing to try anything to make it taste like a proper steakhouse steak. Maybe that's why they offer a free sauce. It was only a few bucks cheaper than the Keg, so I'll think I'll stick with the Keg where the cut is thicker and tastier.

What did I like? The service was fantastic. The wait staff were very attentive. Water and pop were topped up frequently. Bread was fresh, hot, and servied with whipped butter.

The atmosphere is very casual. Like a mix between a Kelsey's and Swiss Chalet."}
{"text":"I love steak, and dinner at a top steak house can't be beaten. Harbour Sixty here in Toronto is one of the best in my opinion. However, if you're the one picking up the tab it's going to be a solid ~$100+/person. The valet parking is kind of annoying, reservations can be tough, and it's over the top fancy which isn't always what I'm in the mood for. I ordered the classic steakhouse meal at Smith Bros, caesar salad to start, then NY strip with mashed potatoes. I'd say it's basically 8/10ths as good as a high end steakhouse for less than 1/2 the price and none of the pretentiousness. Definitely worth a bit of a trek from downtown."}
{"text":"We Loved it!!!  Scarborough has so very few decent places to eat, I really don't understand the bashing.   Mother Tuckers now that deserved some horrid reviews, but not Smith Bros.

 We decided to go on a Saturday evening for our 1st visit.  I had purchased a gift certificate for my Husband for Christmas.  It was busy, so we sat at a long table in the bar area to have a drink and wait for our turn.   It is large and open concept and the noise does travel, but most restaurants open concept now.  We shared the Tavern Sampler.  Our waitress took the time to explain the different choices and seemed very knowledgeable about the different types.  It was a great opportunity to try some varieties of beer, in small servings.   We shared Vegetarian Spring Rolls.  It was only about 20 minutes wait and out table was ready.
  
I have to caution taking reviews to heart about steak or beef from anyone that orders it Well Done!!!, and murders any flavor the beef may have had!

I had the Prime Rib with Yorkshire pudding and garlic and cream mashed potatoes.  The prime rib was cooked to perfection and came medium rare just as ordered.  My husband had the Filet Mignon also perfectly prepared medium rare.   He loved the all the choices of potatoes.   Our server was very good, without hovering over our table.  The wine selection also contains my favourite wine.    Portions were very generous so needless to say no room for desert.  We had a wonderful dinner and looking forward to going back again very soon.  We are very grateful Smith Bros opened in our neighbourhood and it will be our go to spot from now on.
Now we have 3 standby's Diana's  (Seafood)  The Arkadia House (Greek) and Smith Bros, with no need to drive downtown, or to the Danforth.  :o)  Now if someone can open a real pizza restaurant and drive the Pizza pizza's and Domino's out of business I'll be a very happy person!"}
{"text":"Never heard of Smith Bros until recently I was invited here for a friend's birthday.  This restaurant is huge with plenty of room to accommodate large parties.  Although the plaza located in no mans land, the easy parking makes up for it.

The renovation and decor is very similar to many steakhouse restaurants such as the Keg and Jack Astor but the similarities ends there.  The food and service is timely.  

I ordered the 18 oz rib eye steak for $29, very reasonable compared to other chain steakhouse restaurants.  For sides, I chose their creamy mash potatoes.  Their food wasn't spectacular but for the price the quality and quantity was superb.  To compliment the steaks, we had a bottle of red wine for a measly $29!  Wow thats cheap!  I tapped out after finishing the steak and leaving most of the mash potato untouched.

I totally recommend Smith Bros over other chain steakhouse restaurants if you have a huge appetite for quality steak and don't want to break the bank.  But again, its quite a drive for most folk since it is located on a Eglinton East."}
{"text":"We came here for mother's day on Saturday and the place was really busy. We were glad to have made a reservation and were seated immediately. Most of the people at the table with me got the completes (appetizer, main, dessert) and they were very pleased with the food. I decided to go with the all you can eat mussels and fries. I think if I had ordered steak like everyone else (it is a steakhouse after all) I would have given this place a 5 star. While my boyfriend's steak was really good and tender, the mussels were not that great. I could clearly taste the sauce the mussels were in but the mussels themselves did not taste like much. Maybe they had been boiling for too long? I really liked the matchstick fries, however.

The service was amazing from beginning to end. Our waitress was nice, helpful and always there when we needed her."}
{"text":"I LOVE this place!
Great service. Amazing atmosphere. The food is to die for. Great price.
This place is a hidden Gem and we live 5 min away from it. I came here for my boyfriends birthday dinner since we wanted a good steak. I read the reviews on Yelp and decided to give it a try. Best decision and we will be coming back with more of our friends and family to try it."}
{"text":"Many of us are simply occasional Yelpers. Unless you have a shiny badge that says you are an \"Elite\" you probably are only reviewing when something stands out and that can either be good or bad. Unless the food was divine and service exceptional or utterly inedible and downright rude, chances are the average person wouldn't leave a review. Smith Bros unfortunately is on the negative end of that spectrum. 

Now I must start off with a preface, this review is based only on the service. I believe that dining at a restaurant is more than simply about food (like most of the reviews on here), it doesn't matter if you have the best food on the planet but without proper service to get the food to the patron, no one will know how good the food is.

When my friends and I gathered to leave on a trip and we wanted to grab a bite before heading off. We searched up Smtih Bros. and read their menu, looked at their reviews and saw their pricing. We were delighted to find that this was a great place to have lunch with reasonable pricing to boot. We happily arrived and was surprised by the exterior and interior. This place is nice. It looks professional and their open kitchen concept was beautiful. And from this point on it goes downhill. 

The server greeted us, asked if we had reservations (we didn't) and looked at her system to find a table. She told us that they needed to clean a table and asked us to wait at the bar. We stood there marvelling at their kitchen and after about 5 minutes, she arrived with someone who looked like a manager and asked if we wanted to sit at the table we were waiting at. I got a little suspicious and asked wasn't there a table being cleaned while we waited. We took a peak into the dining area and found it half empty. We didn't understand why they couldn't sit us at one of the countless tables already cleaned. He responded that it still needed to be cleaned and his tone changed, he mentioned how people eat at the bar area all time and this table was perfectly fine and if we wanted the dining room table we would have to wait even longer. I believe that while we were waiting, they weren't actually cleaning the table (or any for that matter) but rather debating whether or not to sit us in the dining area with their other patrons. We were dressed like we were ready to go on a trip, sweats, sweaters and casual coats. We looked around and saw that during lunch time a lot of white collared workers would come here. That meant dress shirts and ties. 

Now here is my biggest problem, if you had a dress code let us know and we would gladly adhere to it or come back another time. But this place advertises itself as \"a steakhouse and a tavern all under one roof that won't set you back a mortgage payment\". They want you to feel like you're getting a good deal and it's for everyone but unless you look like you can afford an extra mortgage payment then don't bother coming. We didn't dress like the business people there and because of that we were treated differently. I'm sure we would've enjoyed the meal and loved the food but because of the initial service we didn't get to try any of it."}
{"text":"For the amount of money you're going to spend here you're better off going somewhere else.  I've been here three times and I have to say in terms of food, it has always been a disappointment.  The service however has always been very friendly, even when my mussels had sand in them they took it off the bill no questions.  The women's washroom was disgusting, probably hasn't been renovated since Mother Tucker days. I went with a group of 8 and everyone had the same opinion, \"it wasn't bad, but it wasn't that great either\" .  I think our experience would have been better if our server communicated with us more about the food in general.  No complaints about the deserts"}
{"text":"Imagine mouth-watering, melt in your mouth, cooked to perfection steak; that's exactly what you're going to get at Smith Bros.  I had the rib-eye steak with mornay sauce (lobster, shrimp, mushroom in a brandy cream sauce) and OMG I thought I Had died and gone to heaven.  HIGHLY, HIGHLY RECCOMEND, I guarantee you'll love it."}
{"text":"I have been here three times now, and each time, the service has been wonderful, the food great, and the prices not too hard on your pocketbook!

The first two times I came with family members for special occasions. Everybody loved their steaks and Prime Rib along with the sides of garlic mashed potatoes, salads (fresh and tasty dressings) and the warm bread they bring you before your meal is absolutely heavenly!

Third time was with co-workers (my suggestion) and everyone loved it as much as I do (which made me very happy)

The home made ice cream was delicious as well as the chocolate brownie. 

I may not go back to the Keg ever again :)

I will definitely be returning very soon."}
{"text":"Excelent service provided by Adam, delicious quality food and great ambience. Will be back."}
{"text":"My BFF and I love coming here for the all you can eat mussels which comes with the shoe string fries and home made bread!  YUMMO!"}
{"text":"This is a compilation of several visits. 
The service is always top notch. One of the waiters actually remembered that my wife paid him a compliment to the the manager at the last visit and came over to thank her for her gesture. Unbelievable.

The steak is very good steak for the price. Nothing fancy. Always perfectly cooked to the desired doneness.

Don't want to call this place really top end since the steak is Canadian (not enough marbling), but if I don't feel like paying for Hy's or Jacob's; this is the go to dinner night out with your family or significant others."}
{"text":"I came here about a month with my boyfriend who is an out of towner. This is by far even better then downtown Toronto steakhouses. Service was great, ticket times were about 9 minutes, food was amazing! This is definitely our new go to place. Keep up the great work  scarborough needs you!!"}
{"text":"Opening day I went for lunch and got a surprise free lunch. It was probably a promotional thing since they were opening. I got the all you can eat mussels and it came with a side of shoestring fries. The reg price is $15.99, which is not bad since its all you can eat. Mussels were fresh, could do with a little salt and pepper and little more garlic. Fries were good, a little too thin than I'm used to. They only carry local beers. I tried the raspberry beer, light with a hint of raspberry. My second visit a few days later, I tried the burger $10.99 and added mushrooms as an additional topping. The meat has a good charcoal taste, but a little dry. The party i was with had a roast beef sandwich and chicken avocado sandwich. Roast beef sandwich needed more horseradish and ask for the jus as it doesn't come with one. Chicken avocado sandwich was ok. Fries were a bit undercooked as it was not as golden and crispy as the first day. We also got the beer sampler which you get to  pick 4 flavours to sample. A lot of the furniture was reused from the previous restaurant Tucker's Marketplace, however it's more revamped and classier. They have an open kitchen so you get to see all the action. Appetizers are $5 from 3 to 6pm. I will definitely go back to try the steak and will report back."}
{"text":"Came here only once as my husband and I ordered the prime rib and thought it was just okay. Their salad was good but would definitely go to the Keg instead."}
{"text":"We went there the other week - company Christmas lunch and it was amazing.
Everything was delicious. The appetizers, my steak meal, the dessert! I love steak so I wasn't sure how I would feel about this place but now it's my #1 spot. The staff is great as well. See you again real soon :)"}
{"text":"My friend had recommended me to come here.  Environment and decoration are pretty, staff are friendly and helpful.  
I have ordered their fillet mignon with mashed potato and they give large portion of the side but no veggies.  Only thing is that I find the meat was over-seasoned so it was too salty and my friend who was with me said the same thing.
I had more expectation for the food because of the review and people are comparing it to The Keg but it's nothing compared to it.  I still like Keg better."}
{"text":"Waiter was nice. Food was OK. 
Few hours later my stomach started to hurt ... not sure why. happened to my friend too"}
{"text":"We've never been here before, just recently heard about it on the radio.  The food was great, the decor and ambiance relaxed, music was not too loud, the service and wait staff were attentive, knowledgable, and professional, price was fair for what we ordered.  I would definitely come back and recommend this place to my family and friends."}
{"text":"Loved this place! When I am in the mood for a steak, it was always the Keg I would go to.. But then decided to try something new. This place was awesome! I live downtown and made the trip and it was all worth it! Steaks were fantastic as was the guacamole appetizer, so fresh and a great size for sharing. Service from Claudia was great! Will be back again soon!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I tried the why wait Wednesday's special (a three course meal for $25 each). It was great value for such a large meal - Awesome steak and top notch service. The only suggestion for improvement I have is to serve actual fries instead of the tiny 'matchstick fries' they have. They aren't really much of a side. Overall a great place to go for an affordable steak dinner."}
{"text":"My date and I went there on a Friday. She ordered ribeye and I got strip loin. We both ordered medium rare and the steaks were cooked right at the point. However my strip loin's seasoning was at the lighter side. Service was awesome and we really enjoyed it."}
{"text":"Visited on a Monday night and it was pretty quiet. Good news lots of rare roast beef left and it was excellent. Horse radish with zing too.

I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Great food and atmosphere.  Portions are generous. Prices not as expensive as The Keg. The matchstix fries as a side were really good."}
{"text":"Three of us had dinner on a Thursday evening. This was. In October when a beer sampling was offers. Two steaks which were cooked to perfection and on Prime platter.
Before dinner we were presented with some wonderful tasty sour dough bread.
Our waitress, Gabrielle was very attentive without being overbearing.

As for myself I will definitely return and my friends also.

I would recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"We've taken my son on his birthday to try out the restaurant and it was a good choice, good food, nice rustic décor, we ordered Wednesday special, two can share three courses meal with caesar salad as a starter, NY striploin steak for two with mushrooms and creamy mash, boy! are they good! my steak cooked perfectly.  our services was excellent, she was very fast and courtesy,  I will highly recommend, we will definitely go back to eat again.
p.s. loved their bake bread and whip butter."}
{"text":"Came here twice and both times, I have had positive experiences! 

Ordered their prime rib, New York steak and ribeye steak and tried their draft beer-I promise that it won't disappoint (I'm not a beer girl but I loved it). My boyfriend and I love our steak medium rare on the rare side and it came out perfect. 

From start to finish, the food to the service, everything was exceptional. Good vibes from staff, manager even came to chat and food was on point.

It was a great experience and I would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"A friend of mine brought me here for dinner after I graduated college. This place delivered on all levels. Attentive wait staff. Hot properly cooked food, and BTW. The reason I gave 5 stars and not 4. One of the managers came over and asked \" if everything was COOKED to our liking.\" Way better then The Keg."}
{"text":"Decided to try this place on a whim and was pleasantly surprised. I didn't know what to expect since it used to be  Tucker's Marketplace (which I never ate at before), but wow, this place was pretty good! Prices are fairly reasonable for a steakhouse, they have a limited menu (steak, chicken fish). Don't expect endless options, they stick to what they are good at. 

I ordered the all you can eat Mussels and Fries for $18 (which I thought was a good price). I was served a HUGE bowl of mussels and another huge bowl of their thin cut fries. Everything was delicious. I was filling up, when our waitress came over with another BIG bowl of mussels and fries! I knew it said all you can eat, but I didn't expect that much!! It was great though, no regrets. If you would prefer just one bowl of mussels, you can order it off their appetizer menu for only $10. 

My fiance ordered the salmon with creamy garlic mashed potatoes. They served him a huge filet and a mountain of mashed potatoes -- this place definitely doesn't hold back. I would definitely come again and try their steak.

I recommended this place to friends and they ordered the filet mignon and said it was excellent -- cooked just the way they like it. they also said their baked potato was nice."}
{"text":"Love their wet aged steak and all you can eat mussles. Great service and good atmosphere.   Good value and highly recommended."}
{"text":"Good food and great steaks for Scarborough and the price was good too. The ambience could be a bit dimmer to give it that good old steakhouse feel but the food was great. Ayce mussels?  Sold!"}
{"text":"This was a pretty authentic steakhouse, nothing fancy. They have an open kitchen which is nice. However they are known for their Prime Rib Platter steak and I have to admit that was really good. It is cooked overnight so it is extra tasty. There is not much variety on their menu though, if you go - go for the steak and don't expect to eat anything else. The kids menu is super affordable, $10-12 for a huge portion."}
{"text":"My place for beer and steak in Scarborough.  Nothing beats it. Love the flights of beer (sampler trays of 4 different types of beer).  Steak is amazing.  Appetizers are excellent as well. Would recommend!"}
{"text":"Excellent prime rib for the money.  The New York strip is good.  Pre meal bread is warm and yummy.

Fire grilled shrimp is delicious and the bone in pork chop is ok.  Huge side serving of match stick fries."}
{"text":"Fairly priced, excellent services AND most importantly THE FOOD WERE GREAT!!!!  Especially their Prime rib, only hand full of places has similar quality in GTA area.  Recommended if you are into good food!!!"}
{"text":"I went for lunch here today to celebrate my completion of this semester! I was craving for a realllllly good burger and I saw their sign outside...

\"(a picture of a burger) + (a picture of a pint of beer) = [B2] = $15\"

I had to go there and have some burger.

Service was okay - just a little too slow I think. I wish the burger was more juicy, but overall, it was yummy. The matchstick fries, yeah i love that shit. I wanted a second helping but I was too full. 

I'd probably go back again, and try the other stuff they have in the menu, like the prime rib sandwich...."}
{"text":"Came for dinner on early Sunday evening (6:30pm) and was happy to find that despite the already-huge crowd, our reservation time was kept with no wait, and the famous $35 prime rib platter was still available for order.  

It's a great deal!  The 12oz roast beef was cut thickly, available in done-ness of your choice, with a true to description cooking level.  Medium rare had plenty of warm pink hue, and Medium was the perfect slight pink.  Tender and juicy, you can also opt to get a complimentary ramekin of horseradish in mild or spicy.  The mini gravy boat of beef jus doesn't have much flavour in itself, but is definitely a nice touch to pour over your choice of side dish (the default is mashed potato, but you can easily switch to vegetables or baked potato) and the large fist-sized Yorkshire pudding.

Friendly service, though it was much too busy for our server to come around too much (seriously, the place was packed) but she was nice whenever she had the chance to come around.

Finished my meal with a double scoop of Greg's ice cream in double chocolate chunk and roasted marshmallow.  A perfect way to end a satisfying dinner."}
{"text":"Been quite a few times. Love the atmosphere and the relaxed vibe. The food is great! My boyfriend had the all you can eat mussels which were good. We have also tried the prime rib sliders, the sirloin steak with a starter Caesar salad & mushrooms a of which were very good. However, by far the best thing was the tavern burger with mushrooms. So delicious!!!! Only con I would give would be the sauce that comes with the steak is not very appetizing."}
{"text":"Big downs as this place doesn't serve take out! The food is good here so this was very disappointing to me plus they never gave me a good reason to why they don't do take out!"}
{"text":"Wonderful dinner at Smith Bros!! Very comparable to the Keg, although I would say more value for your money, especially when you order the 3 course meal. The Australian Shiraz went perfectly with the New York Striploin. Some high points of the meal were the Clam Chowder, the steak (of course) and the fresh cheesecake! Server was fast and courteous.  Check out their website for current promos (eg. $30 Thursdays)"}
{"text":"The place has got to be one of the best restaurants in the area! Food, ambience, and service are all excellent. 

The only thing in the restaurant that doesn't fit is the washrooms! You would expect a place with decor this nice to have some floor-to-ceiling, wooden stalls/doors in the washroom, but instead the washroom looks like it could belong in a mall food court."}
{"text":"Very good atmosphere and service. Absolutely LOVED the steak! I finished a whole 10oz sirloin steak OMG!! It was tender and tasty. Also good value for the price!"}
{"text":"A new place with familiar faces, some of the staff were from the previous restaurant.  
The decor was little more upscale, the lighting was low to reflect the ambiance of fine dinning. The buffet tables are now replaced with dinning tables with a great view of the open kitchen. On walls are clusters of family photos in various food preparation, antique butcher scales in middle of dinning hall.
Looks to me it will be great place for a party or on a date.

They only server local beer which is great that they support local businesses. I had the Beau's Lug Tread its a organic beer.  It was surprisingly good, crisp with a hint of fruit it compliment my meal quite well. The wait staff was very attentive, even ask me what I think of the beer. She told me they offer a beer sampler where you can choose 4 different types in smaller portion, will definitely try that next time.

I had the roast beef sandwich with au jus and my party had a tavern burger and tenderloin steak.
The roast beef sandwich was nicely toasted on a panini grill, the beef had a slight pink and tender. The horse radish dressing was mild. The au jus had a light hint of smoke flavour and perfectly seasoned. The first bite of the au jus dipped sandwich tells me hey they know what they are doing.

The tenderloin was as good as The Keg so I am told and they were very accommodating with the baked potatoes having all the fixings on the side. If only they could server it on a hot plate then it would be perfect.

On an early Saturday evening the  place quite busy, our wait staff was great and even the manager I think, came over and ask how everything was.
This could be the making of a great place for steak and ale. Will be back to try the prime rib next."}
{"text":"Was here for New Year's Eve dinner. Made the reservation through open table. It was a nice and easy process. Ambience was casual; I like that they decorated the restaurant with balloons and props to make it festive for their diners. I love the open kitchen feel.

We were greeted and seated right away as soon as we walked in. Our server was friendly and polite. He also explained the menu to us since it was our first time. 

After looking at the menu and food pictures from yelp reviews, we decided to order a house salad, sizzling mushroom pan, prime rib steak dinner, and ribeye steak dinner with mushroom cabernet sauce. Food arrived pretty quickly after our order was placed. We thought the overall quality of food was just 'ok'. We felt that the steak didn't have enough taste by itself without dipping into the sauce and mind you, the sauce wasn't even the best tasting. Ribeye steak was more chewy than other places I've tried. It's too chewy for my liking. I like the marble and tender texture when it comes to ribeye and honestly, I am a ribeye steak girl - 14oz or nothing baby (even though portion size is ridiculous for a tiny girl like me)! 

When taking our finished plates away, our server mishandled a dish resulting in a total mess on the ground. We were disappointed in how the situation was handled because first off, our server did not directly apologized to us. Secondly, the mess was on the ground for what I feel was a long time and third, they did a poor job in cleaning as there was still residues smeared around (if someone walked by and wasn't paying attention, they may result in slipping or ruining their shoes). After all that had happened, our server disappeared and took forever to come back to offer us a dessert menu. 

Overall, it just wasn't a pleasant experience to have me return in the future."}
{"text":"Liked it for the ambiance, the service, and the value! It's a cozy lil hang out spot. I ate a whole bowl of the muscles to my face - what a steal for $10! They were so fresh and perfectly seasoned. Firecracker shrimp was surprisingly spicy. The sauce is coated right onto it... Kind of strongly flavoured but we still enjoyed it! My favourite dish by far were the prime rib sliders! Beautiful flavour and so tender! 

Only mixed review are the fries - very fine matchstick style. Personally I like something meatier or more potato-ey. They're delicious but seem more of a garnish on your burger or steak (like crispy fried onions) than a side to your meal. 

Will be back in the future!"}
{"text":"Came here with the family on a Sunday night.  We had the filet with half lobster combos.  The filet was over cooked and dry, the lobster was slightly over cooked but still decent.  The mushroom steak sauce was amazing.  The kids had fried shrimp which was ok and chicken strips which were ok but lacking flavour.  The matchstick fries were fantastic!  The atmosphere was dark and romantic with high ceilings which made it look very open.  Our server Zack was very knowledgable and friendly (even with our kids).  For this reason we will be back but will try another dish (the appetizer menu looks really good)."}
{"text":"I came here 2 years ago with raving reviews. This time, came on a weeknight with the same expectations.

Ordered a sirloin stack for medium rare, it came medium well. Moreover, my order became a main of broccoli with a side of steak. When I asked for a change of potato to vegetables, they said no problem, it will be just broccoli. I didn't expect an intact crown of a broccoli head.

I spent more time dissecting my green than my meat. Don't call it a steakhouse, great for vegan alternative steak"}
{"text":"Had a sirloin steak there today, one of the worst piece of steak I had :(

I asked for the steak to be done medium, and it was cooked very uneven. There are parts of the steak ranging from bloody rare to well done. Perhaps it was the shape of the steak which made it tough for them to cook evenly. The shape of the steak resembles a fist or a nugget. A significant part of the steak was so tough that it make my jaw sore from chewing. 

Maybe the owners decided to use a low grade beef, that's why they had to use a flavourful sauce to make the steak edible. Really, the sauce was awesome.

In conclusion, with all the great reviews I was expecting something like The Keg. I think I was given a horrible piece of sirloin today and I felt ripped off :("}
{"text":"An average steakhouse. To be really honest, I prefer the Keg over this place. Not to say this place isn't good, it's just average. The PEI mussels were really good and very meaty! The steaks however were reflective of their price; not the greatest cuts of meat I've had."}
{"text":"popped in here for a low key evening where we didn't want the noise of a rowdy bar. 

we got here around 9:35 and the staff were honest to let us know that if we were seated before 10 they would be happy to serve us. I really appreciated their honesty as they close at 10.

we opted for the lounge area they have as I felt the restaurant would be too formal, especially after a long day at work (and a trek out here from Brampton).

we decided to try the 4 sample beers for $7! honestly a steal of a deal - 5oz glass. so we tried all 8 beer they had in two rounds. not disappointed at all - my favourite was the Muskoka dark ale.

for app: I had the PEI mussels, they came in an amazing garlic sauce (I asked for bread and it came amazingly warm - like it was right out of the oven!) the mussels were amazing, and so filling too that I didn't even have to order a main. we also got the fire cracker shrimp but they were way too spicy that we had to send them back, they gave instantaneous heart burn. Ryan was so kind and helpful - even suggested a chicken dish as a replacement to be on the safe side.

the service was great here - didn't feel like we were being bothered but also didn't feel like we were being ignored. 

the ambiance here was amazing - nice, quiet and low key.

I will be returning for a proper dinner one day :)"}
{"text":"This is our favorite steak place and that's saying a lot (I'm from Texas)! Excellent ambiance, food, and service."}
{"text":"I booked a table using Yelp's online reservation service. I'm glad I did as the place was very busy Saturday night. The restaurant is large with an open kitchen. It's quite loud, but there is a small seating area that is walled on three sides which is less noisy. 

They have Pommie's Dry Apple cider on tap. It's a sparkling & fresh alternative to beer. 

They don't serve true 20oz pints. Their's are only 16oz. 

The service was quick, professional and attentive. 

I had the prime rib. I like my meat rare, and this was cooked to perfection. The baked potato was properly cooked, and the jus gravy was tasty. The \"Yorkshire Pudding\" was really just a popover, a bit overdone at that. 

My husband had the ribeye. He likes his meat medium rare, and again, the meat was cooked perfectly. The ribeye itself, however, was quite fatty. About a third of it was fat or gristle; not a very nice cut. 

The bread was hot, nicely crusty on the outside, soft and airy on the inside, served with whipped butter. 

Overall we enjoyed our meal, but for the price were disappointed in the quality of the meat. The chefs  should be applauded for what they managed to make of poorly butchered meat."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I dined here last Wednesday evening with my sister and her boyfriend. We arrived just before 6 and were seated right away. We did not have a reservation so I am glad that we went when we did because the place started filling up and by the time we left, we heard there was a 30 minute wait. Unfortunately, the ceiling was leaking above the first table we were seated at so we moved to the adjacent booth. Our server was accommodating, friendly, and attentive the entire evening and we really enjoyed our experience here. 

They had a $25 Why Wait Wednesday menu that my sister and her boyfriend ordered off of. They went with the Spinach and Artichoke Fondue as their appetizer to share, they both opted for the Classic Surf and Turf with Mashed Potatoes as their main, and the Creme Brulee as their dessert to share. I had some of their fondue and the tortillas chips were freshly made and the dip was cheesy and warm. I also tried one of their shrimps and it tasted great and was cooked perfectly. Also their table bread is really good, it was nice and warm, and fresh!

For my main I had the Filet Mignon, medium rare with Mashed Potatoes and the Crumbled Bacon and Bourbon sauce. I don't eat a lot of steak, but this one was so good that I will have to start eating more! Perfectly cooked and a very good cut of meat, as I would expect from a Steakhouse. There was a generous serving of mashed potatoes and the sauce worked very well with both the meat and the potatoes. 

Overall, I left very satisfied with everything. I haven't been to the Keg in awhile, but I will definitely come back here for the service and a well cooked steak dinner."}
{"text":"Our second visit here and yet again NOT disappointed! We came here with a group of friends(10), which the place accomidated without a problem! The wait staff was prompt and courteous. They serve local micro-brewery beer and is as refreshing as your favourite, go too beer that you always fall back on. The appetizers are great, numerous and leave you wanting, just one more. The main course is a good proportion served with a side, if dersired, and may be a little something else(shrimp or others) depending on what will compliment your main. Their steaks are cooked to perfection and are even better with one of their own home made steak sauces, as if you need anything else, but definitely worth considering. And if you have any more room after they do have a quaint little dessert menu to finish off the meal. Prices are reasonable and respectable, plus you won't leave feeling like you overpaid. We'll be back! FOR SURE!"}
{"text":"Their steak is really good AND it doesn't break the bank if you wanna have a nice dinner. There are different sauce flavours you can choose from as well!
The table next to us had a mussels appetizer and the portion looked huge! 
Definitely eyeing the all-you-can-eat mussels and fries for next time.. it's just such a deal for $22! Or.. maybe I should listen to my boyfriend who always says my eyes are hungrier than my stomach and just order the appetizer.... 
Also the match stick fries are delicious, make sure you order that as a side"}
{"text":"Three of us came on a Tuesday night around 8:30 pm, they just ran out of the prime rib, so we ordered the New York striploin, sirloin steak and their nightly special rack of ribs, as well as their table-side guacamole appetizer.

The guacamole appetizer wasn't bad..but it wasn't remarkable. The server mixed the ingredients for the guac on the table which was a nice personal touch. Personally though, I could have made a similar quality of guac at home. 

The New York strip was supposed to be medium rare but came out more medium - so the meat wasn't as tender and definitely more dry. This was a bit disappointing as I was starving atm and it did take around 30 minutes to get the steak. 

The sirloin however was cooked to a perfect medium rare, so my bro was pretty happy about that. It was way tastier than the strip for that reason. 

The ribs ...I've had better. The meat was not 'fall-of-the-bone' tender as other ribs I've tried in the past. The flavor was O.K. I would not order the ribs again. 

I've come to Smith Bros before in the past; their steak is generally pretty good, but there were more misses than hits on this evening in particular."}
{"text":"I like steak. I like beer. This place has both. Ergo I like this place. Come here. Eat steak. Drink beer. So full."}
{"text":"Came here with my girlfriend for dinner on New Years Eve, and I gotta say I was super impressed by their steaks. We both got the fillet mignon cooked medium rare, and it came cooked to perfection. The steaks were super duper juicy, and the fillet just melted in your mouth, it was FANNNNtAstic! 

We also got a bowl of mussels to share as an appetizer, and that was delicious as well. The mussels had a good amount of flavour to it, and there were plenty to share between us two. 

When I get back into town again, I'll definitely be giving this place another visit to try out some of their other steaks, and you should too, if you are in the area :)."}
{"text":"good environment and atmosphere
service is good
I like their all you can eat mussels and prime rib platter"}
{"text":"You always hear of dry-aged beef, but have you heard of wet-aged? Smith Bros. is one of those underrated gems in Toronto. Seriously, one of the best steaks in the city for the price you're paying.  Their steaks are wet-aged a minimum of 28 days, meaning they are vacuum sealed to retain its moisture and aged with its own juices.  Love the Ribsteak ($38)!

Their matchstick fries are addicting.  Their mussels are really good too. If you think you can eat a lot, they have All You Can Eat Mussels and Fries for $25."}
{"text":"Been here twice now; once for lunch and once for dinner and both meals were great!  

 The ribeye steak is excellent and the matchstick fries are a good compliment.  The prime rib is also wonderful.  Tender and juicy with lots of flavor.  The berry cheesecake was light and fluffy.  A great way to end any meal.  

Service is excellent as well although the dining room itself may be a little on the dark side."}
{"text":"Great food and service! Was here for my Birthday with 14 people. They did a great job accommodating us and we all had a fantastic time. Everyone enjoyed their food and had no complaints. Easy to find location with ample parking, Np need to go downtown. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"The waitstaff are extremely friendly, we have a big group of ten and unfortunately half the people couldn't make it in the last minute. The restaurant was extremely accommodating. They even re-decorated the table for us so it is less intimidating. And they are friendly even though we are late by almost an hour."}
{"text":"Went for my birthday and three if us had steak.  Three different steaks the only one that was  good was the filet mignon (didn't look like a filet mignon) and it wasn't super good.   Service was slow and for $160 it was way,way over priced.  The Smith brothers beer was watery and almost flavourless."}
{"text":"Love this place . This is my second time now going and I'll Def.  Be back with more friends and family.  I had the dumplings to start then a perfectly cooked steak with a side of mash to die for. My wife the same and a bottle of wife for the table. Our bill was less then $100. Plus the service was impeccable and I love the decor. They Def.  Have a regular out of me!"}
{"text":"I have been here a few times. The meals do not dissappoint.
The Atlantic Salmon with garlic and cream mashed potatoes is my favourite.The menu is a bit limited for choices in my opinion. But the menu is done right. Never had a complaint when I went. The tavern sampler is good for choosing whats on tap."}
{"text":"Better than The Keg in my opinion. Their steaks are juicier, and the sauces compliment it very well. Their desserts are also top quality as well, especially the creme brulee. Service is good too, making sure our food is to our standard and to theirs as well. Definitely would recommend to anyone looking for a good steakhouse to try out."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a decent steak at a reasonable price, look no further!

Good steak however, if you're expecting something similar to the Keg, don't!

The style of steak is very different. Whereas keg is all about the seasoning and no sauce, Smith bros is about less seasoning on the steak itself paired with a yummy sauce of your choosing. 

Their steaks are generally on the thinner side, but pack a good flavour. 

Fries were shoestring style and were crunchy & delicious. They also have their own brewery and beer which I would recommend a pint of as well to accompany your steak!

Meat eaters in the scarbs area rejoice as Smith bros is a great alternative to the Keg. Pricing is also very reasonable, and they have special promotional offers every now and then if you signup for their promo emails. Happy steaking"}
{"text":"Went here with my family and I'd say the food was 3.5/5 and service was 4/5.  

I had the avacado mayo burger with the house salad.  I wasn't a huge fan of the salad dressing but the burger was delicious.  It was extremely filling and the the goat cheese and avocado made each bite so divine.  The bun was so soft from all the juices. It was literally falling apart when I was biting into it cause of who stuffed the burger was.  And the burger patty itself was amazing. Flavoured and cooked nicely.  

I had a bite of the fish n chips.  I'd say if you're going to a steak house .. not to order this. It was nothing extraordinary... the other food was definitely better.  But if you really don't like beef... I guess this is a solid option.  I had a bite of the filet mignon and it was also delicious. Their fries are different (as you can tell from the picture). 

The service was great. We also had the manager walk around table to table asking if everything was good -- which I've barely seen at restaurants.   

The pricing was like any regular American pricing. The steaks were a bit expensive -- but I guess steak is always on the pricier end.  Overall a great place to check out"}
{"text":"Great bang for your buck.  I find the seasoning of the steaks to be better  than the keg and the quality of meat about the same.  For the price you can't go wrong, the service is professional and food is consistent.  Not crazy about their fries but the other potato concoctions are killer.  Their house brand beer is also pretty good, the price makes it even better."}
{"text":"Loved the decor, prices are super fair, nice atmosphere, great service... steak was good .... the only aspect I didn't like was guacamole was underwhelming ... 

Came her for Father's Day based on a coworkers recommendation, glad I did.

We ordered salmon and 2 steaks, table side guacamole 


My dad loved his salmon 

I loved my seafood steak... steak melted in my mouth 

My mom didn't like her steak, but then again she order her steak well done, even though we advised her not too...

Blueberry cheese cake is a must ... 

Will return... great for a family and date"}
{"text":"This place exceeded my expectations.

I came here with my family for a nice steak dinner. They let us know that if some of us weren't in the mood for a pound of beef, they could share (which many people did). I got the NY sirloin steak, but had some of my brother's prime rib, which was incredible (my steak was good, too, but I was blown away by the prime rib.) Also, they will do your steak blue. Properly blue. Everyone else's sides looked really good. The Hubster got shoestring fries, and a few people got mashed potatoes (which I can't eat, due to dairy). I asked for a vegetable side and got a huge stalk of steamed broccoli. Just steamed, possibly salted, not even cut up. A bit unimaginative for a side, if you ask me. And frankly, not very tasty.

The bread was out of control, crispy on the outside and soft like an angel's touch on the inside. My only issue was that service was kind of slow. There was a lot of waiting around to get our orders in, receive drinks, pay for the bill, etc. But service was friendly. 

Another odd thing, they wouldn't take reservations between 5:30 - 7:30 on Sunday, even thought the place seemed kind of dead at 7:30 Sunday. 

The cost came to less than I anticipated. The prices are very reasonable, particularly considering the quality of the beef and the size of the servings. 

I'm definitely going to go back, and I'm getting an entire portion of prime rib to myself."}
{"text":"All you can eat mussels for $18. Definitely doing this again, the beer mussels are plump and juicy and the shoestring fries are perfectly crisp. 

We also tried the ny striploin and mashed potatoes (comparable to the keg). 

The only thing I would pass on is the mushroom sizzler as a side, they were soggy and the garlic was overpowering (and I'm a garlic lover)."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed their all you can eat mussels. They were fresh and seasoned perfectly.  They also have a great open concept kitchen and their prices were of great value."}
{"text":"Came here mid week just to check the place out and get a good steak. I wasn't disappointed.
This place is the ultimate beer and steak restaurant. You hear a lot about upscale steakhouses and wine, but this place specializes in beer and matching beer and food, and they are pretty good at it.
The décor is very casual, with nice comfortable seats and plenty of airflow. Service is fast, friendly and knowledgeable.
As I said before, this place specializes in matching beer and food, so the wine list is barely an afterthought of just 6 cheap LCBO standard list red bottles. Gluten free diners need to make sure they inform the staff to avoid most of the standard sides and condiments.
As for the steaks, they are really good. Tender, flavourful, perfectly cooked, with some nice shoestring fries, now that's a meal!
I skipped dessert because I ate my whole steak and had no more room, but there are some nice looking choices if you want.
I don't know if I will be back. The steak was really good, but the wine list is pathetic and there are no gluten free items except for the steak, fries and salad. I guess if that is the only thing I want and I am in the neighbourhood, I might return."}
{"text":"Came here with my girlfriend. Very nice place. It's got a warm and ambient setting which really makes you feel like home. The portions are huge. we got the mussels, a salad and 1 main course; which was more than enough for both of us. Our server was very professional as well. Will come again."}
{"text":"Came here during lunch with my coworkers, and had a great experience!

I got the prime rib dip stacked sandwich, and loved it! The portions was huge. The sandwich was stuffed with load of yummy prime rib cooked to perfection (I asked for medium rare). I got a side of matchstick fries with spicy mayo, which was also awesome! They also give you a ton of fries. I was only able to finish half the sandwich and half the fries, so I had enough left over for lunch the next day too!

Our waitress was very attentive. She came by often to check on us. And promptly refilled any empty glasses that she saw, and cleared away empty plates quickly.

Next time I'm in the area, I definitely won't hesitate to visit again!"}
{"text":"We live in mid-town and my wife wanted to try another steakhouse other than the Keg or some expensive option downtown which I wasn't in the mood for.
Glad we did because \"almost \" everything was beyond our expectations. 
The beer and wine selection were very reasonably priced and we had a nice bottle of the Blackstone Syrah wine with our meal. 
Wanted a cocktail before but found they were totally lacking in that department with poor selection and waitress knowledge , she didn't even know what an Old Fashioned or Manhattan were or even if they had Bourbon or Scotch!!!
Although the apps are not typical steakhouse fare they were good, the house salad was excellent.
Now to the meat!! Wife had 10oz.,strip with peppercorn sauce and baked potato, I had the 14oz., ribeye medium-rare with bourbon bacon sauce and delicious match stick fries.
Both steaks were cooked perfect and were served right and were delicious!!!
Only one bone to pick (pun intended) with Smiths is the fact that it doesn't have a bone-in steak option which should be standard for any good steakhouse and for that reason I cannot give them a perfect score.
We will be back to try some more of the menu but please bring in the bones!!"}
{"text":"The ambiance is different...one area was renovated completely and looked like a proper steak house dining area. The other part was a very family styled restaurant theme (think Swiss Chalet). 


Overall for a location in Scarborough and being a restaurant that I never heard of - I cant lie the selection and price of food was above par. I really enjoyed my 14 oz Rib eye and considering that it didnt cost an arm and a leg satisfied my belly even more.

The service was beyond expectation. We wanted to make changes in our order and the server was more than happy to make them. 

If you are looking for a good well done (as in prepared and marinated correctly- not grilled to darkness...i'm not a neanderthal) steak at a fair price. I recommend this place. The spicy shrimp app they had was fantastic as well."}
{"text":"Best steakhouse in Scarborough! Made reservations for 2 for an early Valentine's Day dinner, although we arrived we were still seated promptly. The waitress was friendly and went through the daily specials and told us about the signature dish which was the prime rib platter (obviously we had to get that). We also order the prime rib dip which ok, a little overcooked as we had asked for medium rare. But the prime rib was excellent cooked medium rare juicy and seasoned perfectly."}
{"text":"Amazing. Wonderful. Impressive.  Everything from the service, food, prices, and atmosphere are all Spectacular. (I am slowly running out Positive Adjectives for this review) in short...this place is AWESOME! 

I came here for Valentines Day dinner and I was smart and made reservations well in advance. We arrived and were seated immediately to our table. We ordered Mussels, Filet Mignon, Seafood Sirloin, Vanilla and Strawberry ice cream, Creme Brulet, Vodka Martinis, and some salad.  All of the food tasted wonderful!! The comolimentary bread was so fresh and melt in your mouth goodness!  All of the prices were dirt cheap from what you would normally expect from a steak house.

They have a really cool Open Kitchen where you can see your meal being freshly prepared and you can ensure that the chefs do not follow the \"2 minute rule\" or do anything crazy to your food.  The ambience is casual yet not too casual...fancy yet not too fancy...

Our server was attentive and not annoying. The manager even came and checked around each table to make sure everything was going well and all of the customers were satisfied.

All in all this is a great place to come and enjoy a great steak with great people. I am definitely coming back here soon!

I do not venture out to Scarborough often, but Smith Brothers is a hidden gem!"}
{"text":"The food was actually good, service was ok.  The biggest issue we had was after we brought to their attention that they served ciabatta instead of the rosemary focaccia on the menu.  This was after saying twice that it was ok and we were happy with the chicken avocado stack sandwich.

After some delays and a conference with the kitchen, we were told that they don't even have ciabatta in the restaurant.  The bread we had on the sandwich was dry, and dusted with flour.  There was no oil or rosemary.  We were having a good meal and planning our next trip back, but being lied to really took the experience away.  I doubt we'll be going back, at least to this location.

You shouldn't assume your customers don't know the difference between breads.  All this after just trying to helpfully remind them of the oversight."}
{"text":"If your first thought about a steak house is that the potatoes were good then yeah it wasn't that great. I thought my steak was cooked medium like I asked but the wife's was a little over cooked. Also the steak was pretty bland and could have used a sprinkle of salt. The mashed potatoes as mentioned were really good. We got creme brûlée for dessert and it was just ok. A solid place but no standout dishes or food. Would not go out of my way to get back"}
{"text":"Review based on the Prime rib $34 and ayce mussels $24. No compliants here.

Our waiter was a very attentive and friendly elder gentleman. He always made sure our glasses were full and came around just in time to replace the mussels. Never had to call him over for anything, and he was never intrusive.

Prime rib: 5/5 - I really enjoyed it cooked med rare. The creamy horseradish was so good!

Mussels: each serving was plentiful. Our server said the sauce was made with beer (not white wine), shallots and garlic. Distinctly bold in flavour. Mussels were very meaty!! I think I had 3 rounds.

My new favorite steakhouse in Scarborough. Although, I have yet to try their steak."}
{"text":"Great for what you pay for..not my favorite ..but nice place for date or few drinks and a bite. Doesn't feel like Scarborough inside ;) & decor is decent too (Used to be Tuckers) but can't tell."}
{"text":"This is by far my favorite local steakhouse. I highly recommend that you give their 'Why Wait Wednesdays' deal a try. This includes an appetizer, 2 entrees and dessert for just $50! Wow! 

My boyfriend and I really enjoy their craft beers and steaks (with extra seasoning). We've stopped going to the Keg ever since we've found this spot."}
{"text":"One of the best steaks I've ever had.  Cooked perfectly to my liking.  My fiance also had her steak cooked perfectly.  The service was outstanding.  We were served by a guy named Adam, who gave some of the best service I've ever had.  He came multiple times to refill our water, offer us more bread, and checked that everything was to our liking.  Even when he was serving someone else, if something was ready, whoever was available brought it to our table.  Multiple servers walked by and checked on us as they went to their other customers.  When we asked for a take out container, Adam even asked (without us implying) if we wanted to take a loaf of bread home with us since we liked it so much.  The atmosphere was very relaxed and open. I was very impressed with Smith Bros, their food and staff and will be back again.  I can't speak for the other reviewers with bad service, but I had some of the best service I've ever had anywhere!"}
{"text":"Still giving this place a 5 star. Still a winner for best steaks, melt in your mouth prime rib and all you can eat mussels. How can you go wrong with that?! Prices have gone up for certain items on the menu by $2-3 bucks but honestly, it's still a bang for your buck!

We had George as our server almost every time we come here. He's got awesome attention to detail and quick about service but not too quick - so that we can enjoy our apps without being rushed into dinner course meal.

We ordered all you can mussels with their chips. Broth is delicious. A bit salty but I like it!

My boyfriend ordered the prime rib as always and it came with either a baked potato or mashed potato. I tried the rib eye steak for the first time with their mashed potato and it was heavenly. It was delicious and perfectly done. I still don't bother with the keg and still only come here for our special occasions.  The general member always come to check in on us and all the other guests to see how dinner service is going.

Never going back to the keg!"}
{"text":"I went in for dinner on a Friday night at around 7pm.  If you don't have reservations, you're in for about a 15 minute wait.  

I was very happy with their drink selection.  They had some ciders and fruity beers on the list, which pleases my girly palate.  I plan on going back just to try more of the drinks.  

The service was prompt and competent, but not exactly friendly.  The servers, hostesses, and manager (head chef?) were all doing their jobs, no extra.  

I enjoyed the booth seating, open view into the kitchen, and dim lighting.  The dark modern look suited the tavern/steakhouse concept.  It was way too noisy though!  The open kitchen, unfinished ceilings, and lack of noise absorption materials or barriers contributed to the problem.  Husband had to repeat himself EVERY time he said anything to me.  

The food was hit and miss.  The freebie bread was amazing, soft and fluffy and warm in the centre.  The steak and potato chowder was gross, it tasted like a bowl of gravy.  The caesar salad had about three times as much dressing as it needed - even Husband who likes a heavy hand on the dressing agreed with me.  By the time I was halfway through the salad, the croutons were thoroughly saturated.

For mains we both ordered prime rib with Yorkshire pudding and mashed potatoes.  The prime rib was unbelievably tender, and came with fantastic au jus.  The Yorkshire pudding was also soft and fluffy and warm.  Mmm..  :D

Dessert was apple cobbler for both of us.  Husband picked off his ice cream and left the rest.  I didn't really enjoy it either; the oatmeal, cinnamon, and brown sugar topping was kind of tough and hard, and just missing at being crispy and delicious.  

Overall the experience was comparable to Canyon Creek or Milestones, and was decent value for money.  I'd say even with the inconsistent quality on the food, it already takes the spot as best steakhouse in this neighbourhood - not much competition!  I probably will go back, now that I am wiser in what items on the menu to avoid."}
{"text":"Bread was very fresh and came warm, entree was average. Not completely satisfied though because the level of service was not good enough for this level of restaurant. Our server Ray was inattentive. I didn't have a fork for my salad for the longest time and ended up having to get it myself from another empty table. Maybe he was just unmotivated to do a good job because it's default gratuity for larger tables."}
{"text":"LOVE! Had the $5 appetizers (during happy hour 3-6pm) - mussels and shrimp. mussels were amazing, and definitely a bargain at $5.

For the main, I had the seafood sirloin- sirloin topped with a seafood sauce, lobster and shrimp. Very flavourful and delicious! This was paired with a huge serving of (probably the best) garlic mash. Would highly recommend this."}
{"text":"**Late review

Smith Brothers Steakhouse Tavern is, of course, known for their steaks! We wanted to try somewhere new that isn't The Keg or Canyon Creek.

We made a reservation but still had to wait a little bit as they had a party on the table and they were trying to usher the table out. Not sure how they managed to 'usher the table out', but we managed to sit within 15 minutes, though it was still slightly after our reservation time. Throughout the entire process, the hostess and manager kept us updated regarding the situation.

Menus were simple and easy to read! They do not offer that many options which can be a good or bad sign. Good because this means that this restaurant definitely specializes in steaks by not having much to offer. Bad because if you come with a group and some of your friends do not wish to eat steak, there's only a small handful of options to choose from.

Our server, Roy, was really nice and took care of our group well. He started us off with bread and butter after taking our orders. We were given about 3 baskets of bread. Their butter was really soft and creamy, which I liked. It made it easy to spread on the bread!

I ordered the 7oz Steak with Mushroom Cabernet Sauce with Baked Potato and all my toppings were on the side. My Baked Potato toppings included sour cream, butter and chives - pretty standard.

I think it's pretty cool how they put the sauce separately in a gravy tin like that. I tried the Matchstick Fries and I don't really like how thin it was - I could barely taste it. :(

Personally, I don't drink alcohol that much so I tasted the Cabernet in the sauce after 2-3 bites. One of my friends who drinks regularly even stated that she can taste the wine in the sauce. So yeah, pretty strong taste and definitely not to my liking because of that. Baked Potato is always awesome, and I ordered my Steak medium rare which was done perfectly.

There's many other sauces to choose from for the Steak options such as, Peppercorn Cream, Teriyaki and Crumbled Bacon & Bourbon. I tried the Peppercorn Cream sauce off another friend's, and found it too peppery, but she liked it just fine. One of my other friends tried the Crumbled Bacon & Bourbon but I didn't get to try it! Oh well, haha.

Overall, I found Steak Bros to be yummy and they have really good service. Though I'm not a fan of the Mushroom Cabernet sauce, I'm pretty sure I can try another sauce next time. Probably the Crumbled Bacon & Bourbon one!

Even though Smith Bros is quite a trek to get to (for me at least), I would recommend eating here :) !"}
{"text":"Came here for Valentines Day dinner and I was pretty impressed with this steakhouse tavern located in the east end. We made reservations knowing that it would be a busy night and we are sure glad we did. The moment we walked in, it was bustling and lively! Our host seated us immediately and the great service continued on throughout the night. Our server was very attentive, professional and friendly making the experience more memorable. The manager also walked by and asked us how our meal was and we responded, \"everything tastes amazing!\".

The meal started off with complimentary bread and butter that was absolutely delicious...it was freshly baked and melted in your mouth. It was so good, we even ordered a second serving! We ordered an appetizer of mussels, a filet mignon steak meal for each of us and a vanilla creme brulee/vanilla bean ice cream to end off the meal. The mussels had a nice buttery garlic flavour that was cooked to perfection. The filet mignon was just the right portion with a nice charred taste and cooked medium well. Our dessert was the perfect combination and was suprisingly good with their \"natural\" vanilla bean ice cream specially picked from Greg's Ice Cream and not to mention a generous serving of their tasty vanilla creme brulee.

The restaurant had a nice casual and modern feel with their kitchen being open concept so you could admire the chefs preparing everyone's meal. 

Overall, it was the perfect place to celebrate the occassion with a restaurant that we'll surely go back to."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place.
Great atmosphere, delicious food, tasty drinks, nice staff. What more could you ask for? 
I always make a reservation for this place though no matter how busy or quiet I think they'll be. It just makes things easier.
I've tried a few different main dishes which were all delectable. This is one of the few places that I have multiple items that I'd want to choose from because typically, when I want to go to a specific restaurant, it's to order a specific dish to eat. 
I've introduced many people here and not one person has said anything bad about it.
If you don't have a meat lover inn your party, no worries! You can always get a couple of their seafood options including their all you can eat mussels served in a delicious white wine sauce..drool.
They also offer complete meals at a good price where you can have an app, main course, and dessert. 
My go to dessert their is their cheesecake. It's nothing I've every tried before..Yum!"}
{"text":"Given my expectations, I was deeply disappointed with the steak. Lacking the full flavour on the outside, and the New York was dry on the inside (saved for a small portion) of my medium. The prime rib was much tender and juicier. 

Excellent service, and the rest of meal was pretty good."}
{"text":"Second time here for a friends birthday on April 5th. The night started out good, with the waitress seeming friendly. She later started to give us (a table of 7) a paper with her number and name, telling us to check out some f-ing stupid pyramid scheme she was involved in because \" we seem like cool people\". I didn't come here to get involved with your crap.

Next came the food. I got the mushroom soup with my main, which tasted like unseasoned mushroom water. My mate got a steak, which he asked for medium well, and came out medium rare. I informed the server, then the manager came around and asked how our meal was - I told him. He compd. our soup and steak, which was correct on his half and I did appreciate it. I only complained because I thought the kitchen was unaware of what they were putting out and hoped it would not happen to other customers.

Beer was good, other food was good. Would come again if the server is not there and hopefully the food will be better."}
{"text":"We were going to go to the chain pizza restaurant next door, until I saw this restaurant. 


For the drink, I ordered the Feature Taps $7.5

Pommies Dry Cider
light, refreshing, beautifully balanced and made from 100% Ontario heritage apples

It was a good size for the cup. It lasted my whole meal.

For appetizer, we ordered the 
Firecracker Shrimp $10
crispy panko shrimp tossed in sweet, spicy red curry sauce

The shrimps were a good size and cut butterfly style and the sauce has a good kick to it. It's a unique appetizer compared to other restaurants.

For my main, I ordered the 

Seafood Sirloin 7 oz. $32
topped with poached lobster, shrimp and mushrooms in brandy cream

I like my steak medium, but it turned out slightly under medium rare. But service was excellent, they were apologetic and took the steak back to cook it to medium. The sauce can use more lobster and shrimp. It was like a thicker lobster bisque.

My boyfriend ordered the PRIME RIB PLATTER 12 oz. * While it Lasts * $34
hand-carved Prime Rib au jus, warm from the oven yorkshire pudding, garlic and cream mashed potatoes

I asked for a sample bite, it was very tender and juicy. 

Will return with family to try out other items on the menu!"}
{"text":"Great little spot. Solid alternative to the keg with a more family friendly feel.  
Comfortable seating and very attentive wait staff/managers. 
Big and industrial looking, in house beers which were very good! 
I got the seafood sirloin and mashed potatoes and it was awesome. My boyfriend got the sirloin prix fix menu which came with a soup or salad ( ceasar salad) and a dessert (cheese cake was suggested). Good food, the cheese cake was meh... luckily it was my birthday and the waiter brought me a brownie on the house which was amazing!! 
I would come here again. It would be good for a large group. 
Keg has better romantic atmosphere. It would be nice if the bathrooms were clearly labelled or if the seating was more private as we had a lot of children in our area. 
Overall good experience"}
{"text":"LOVE their seafood sirloin with matchstick fries and P.E.I Mussels. Portions are huge for a reasonable price. 

I get the same thing everytime I come here. 

Even if you are not a fan of red wine (like myself), you should still try the Blackstone Syrah. Super full-bodied and has a buttery taste. Goes super well with red meat!"}
{"text":"This was my second time coming here and It was just as tasty as the last time!

We came here to fill our tastebuds request for some juicy steak! Oh how our tastebuds danced!

We started off with Caesar Salad. It was very good and tasty and just the right amount of dressing! I loved it and gobbled it up before the warm bread even came to the table. Yes, it was that good! The warm bread is nice to hold you over if you don't order a appetizer. Now on to the \"cream of the crop.\" I ordered the filet mignon with the peppercorn sauce and my boyfriend had ordered the strip loin with a bourbon sauce. Both were made to the desired temps and were extremely tender. My filet melted in my mouth like butter! (I'm starting to drool just thinking about the impact of flavour) The strip loin was good as well but no match to the filet mignon. 

Verdict? Amazingness! Great, friendly service from all staff. The steaks are amazing and the sauces compliment most of them. Definitely, a place to stop by and try! Will be back in the future for sure!"}
{"text":"When dining out in Scarborough there seems to be only 2 choices, sketchy hole in the wall or chain restaurant. It is for this reason that Smith Bros. seems a little out of place. 

A recent UYE organized by Jennifer K. brought us here to have dinner and celebrate Robbie Burns day.  Our large group was accommodated easily and our dinner went off without a hitch (this is a real credit to the staff as restaurants sometimes have a hard time handling a large group). 

I opted for their prix-fix menu. My Mushroom soup appetizer was delicious, creamy, and earthy, with meaty chunks of mushrooms. For my main I opted for the 7oz sirloin, with mashed potatoes and bacon and bourbon sauce. My steak was cooked to a perfect medium rare, beautifully charred on the outside and juicy on the inside, it was practically melt in your mouth. Very few things in life are better than a perfectly cooked steak, and these guys certainly know their way around a piece of meat. The mashed potatoes were average, and the bacon bourbon sauce was quite good with a strong bourbon kick. For dessert I had 2 scoops of Greg's ice cream, the red ale infused ice cream was amazing, it's a must try. Not only was all this food delicious, but my 3 course meal only cost $25. 

What sets Smith Brothers apart from other steakhouses is the fact that their beer selection is exclusively Ontario brewed craft beer, like their steaks, also served at a reasonable price. If you're new to craft beer or not sure which you will like they also offer tasting flights (4 samples) for about the price of a pint. 

The service was excellent, our waiter was attentive and did a good job managing our large group and splitting the bill. The food came out pretty quickly despite the place being busy. The dim lighting and exposed wood gives this restaurant a great ambiance, but really you must come here for the food and beer. At this price you will be hard pressed to find a better steak and better service. I for one will definitely be back; this is officially a Scarborough gem. 

*The also do happy hours on weekdays with $5 apps"}
{"text":"The service and food was top notch!  Love the sophisticated rustic ambiance."}
{"text":"Being someone from Markham, I wanted to find a new steakhouse that wasnt The KEG or the usuals that you would find at East Beaver Creek. After searching on Yelp and seeing decent reviews for Smith Bros, my family and I went to try. 

Friendly staff and good service. Lots of parking as it was located in a large plaza. Spacious interior as well. 

PEI Mussels - the mussels were fresh, cleaned and well seasoned. The lager didnt overpower the mussels, and the shallots and parsley complimented well with the mussels. A good portion of them as well. Great for sharing. 

Prime Rib - they were known for their prime rib, so we went for it. One was cooked medium rare but another was done medium well. We told our server and they kindly gave us another one, and the second dish was much better in terms of temperature. That being said, the prime rib was soft and tender, just like how it should be. Horseradish was nice and strong, giving it a great kick and spice to the overall dish. The yorkshire pudding was well puffed and soft and doughy, just like how it should be. Paired well with the jus. 

Rib-Eye steak - nice and tender with a good peppercorn sauce. Overall good but nothing special in particular. Baked potato we ordered was nicely baked as well.

Overall a great dinner and a nice change from the usual steakhouses in town. Will go back if in the neighborhood!"}

Well, well, well, what do you think of that?! We couldn't tell you how a wet-aged steak tastes like but you bet we'll be back to check it out.

Hubby and I wanted something lighter for lunch so I had the House Salad with Dijon Vinaigrette, the Seasonal Shiitake Mushroom soup and a pineapple coconut shake. Hubby opted for the Mushroom Emmenthal (fancy Swiss cheese) Burger with caramelized onions and BBQ baste. 

The soup was filled with Shiitake mushrooms: savoury and delicious. The salad was fresh and was tossed with the perfect amount of dressing; I didn't need to ask for extra dressing. The shake was oh so yummy, I could have had it for dessert. My hubby's burger was thick, juicy and well seasoned. 

The manager (hard working man who also busses the tables) makes rounds to check in on everyone. I happened to mention that the crust of the bread that was served with my soup was rock hard, I even showed it to him; he apologized and was kind enough to offer us a free dessert. We ordered a Mixed Berry Cheesecake. Why yes, I had to get coffee to go with the dessert. The cheesecake was soft not dense like a NY cheesecake; it was ok. The coffee was Brazilian and served with actual cream: smooth and delicious.

We had the sweetest waitress; she took very good care of us. She was knowledgeable of the menu but if she didn't know the answer, she would smile sweetly, and excuse herself so she could go and find the answer. 

To enjoy yourself here: you need to find out which dishes to order, come when they offer lunch specials, and notify management of any problems not resolved by the wait staff. They do have an open kitchen so you  have background noise in addition to the music and the different conversations going on during the busy hours.

Yes, we are coming back for the wet-aged steak!"}
{"text":"Smith Brothers was on the list of top 10 steakshouses in Toronto, my friend and I came here because we wanted some quality steak without having to travel too far from Markham. 

We got here around 8:30pm on a Wednesday night, there was only two or three other tables already eating. Another two tables sat down by the time we left. We were seated by the semi-friendly hostess and was served by a even less friendly server. He wasn't rude, but he wasn't exactly personable either. 

We ordered the mussels to share, which was good. Both my friend and I ordered the seafood sirloin - medium rare, the menu read like it's surf and turf, \"topped with poached lobster and shrimp in a brandy cream\" it said. When our meals came, the steak had bite pieces of lobster and shrimp in a brown sauce covering it with a brown sauce as well as a side \"seafood topping\" in a gravy dish. Both our steaks were undercooked, it was more on the rare side than medium rare, the sauce was very salty. I must admit that the matchstick fries were ace though, but it honestly doesn't justify the entire meal.

I am utterly unimpressed with Smith Brothers and not sure why they're on a list for the best steakhouses in Toronto."}
{"text":"I love the ambiance here.  The place is casual yet has a classy vibe, the food is succulent and moderately priced.  The service was quick, efficient and friendly.  I enjoyed the fact that the kitchen was visible from both the dining and bar area, and from time to time, you get to see fire spark up as they cook the steaks.   I would definitely come back, but I can't honestly say that it's my favorite place to grab a steak, but it really wish I could!  There is one thing that bugs me, which is that the steaks have way too much fat to meat content.  The steaks themselves are cooked perfectly and are seasoned amazingly.  The steaks also come with amazing thin cut fries reminiscent of hickory sticks chips along with your choice of gravy, which is great, but again, but there was just way too much fat to meat ratio for me to give this establishment a perfect score.  For reference, I tried both the ribeye and the New York striploin.  I love the bread they serve, it's fresh, hot, soft and tender.  It's definitely a treat.  I look forward to going back and trying out their burger, which looks amazing, based on the yelp reviewers' photos.  4.5/5"}
{"text":"Came here on a friday night with short notice reservation. 

The complimentary bread is really good!! One of my favourite places for complimentary bread... it's served warm with soft, whipped butter. 

Ordered the sirloin steak with matchstick fries as well as the ribeye steak with mashed potatoes. Medium rare for both. They were pretty good, though a little chewy. The sirloin was softer and more flavourful. Sauces were good (mushroom cabernet and bacon bourbon, mushroom cabernet was better). 

Nice place for a date, open kitchen, dimmed lighting and some interesting decor. Recommended!"}
{"text":"This is a fabulous restaurant, with wonderful and delicious food. The servers are terrific! The steaks are to die for. Absolutely fantastic."}
{"text":"When you experience Smith Bros., you'll come to realize it's a dining anomaly.  On a Google Map of GTA, no worthy steakhouse should appear in Scarborough but there it is miles away from anywhere, a beacon shining brightly above all the franchises.

It's a welcoming change from various steakhouses that caters to mostly suits and couples.  Here lies my bias, as SB fills to the brink with Families & Friends whom we all are.  When I see children with their mothers, toddlers with their parents, friends with friends, it brings back memories of rare occurrences having steak dinner with my own family in my childhood years as my mom watches on and takes my leftovers if there's any.

SB makes the above possible with some very appreciated philosophy.  Undoubtedly first and foremost to the pleasure of the general public is the reasonable affordable prices for the above-standard quality products on offer which is not particularly common in these parts. Most notable is their prix-fixe COMPLETES which saves you a further few bucks if you are a big time feast master.

Fresh oven-baked complimentary bread arrives and disappears as quickly as it lands requiring much appreciated comp refills.  Salads or Soups are both equally good selections making another hard choice to make, but I like to stick with my Smith Bros. House Salad. A side of your choice is inclusive of your steak order, yeah!  From Sirloin to Prime Rib, it's been cooked as requested and almost better consistency than I've imagined which speaks to the top skills of the cooks at the helm.

Next is the acceptance to tackle on local products such as Greg's Ice Cream and Great Lakes Brewery as well as various other local brewers.  To say no-thanks to the big corporate brews(i.e. Molson, Bud) is sure gutsy.  If you find another steakhouse in GTA strongly promoting local craft beer selling for $5.00 a pint EVERY night, let me know and I'll gladly treat you to a fresh one.  On the sad note, the wine selection is minimal impact however caters to the wallet-friendly side of me.

I think Chris & Adam(Smith Bros) have achieved something many of us can only daydream about and when you can understand what Smith Bros. is all about, you'll be able to see through their eyes the true vision of a dream restaurant.

Tip: Ask if Adam(the Server) is there. That's where you want your table."}
{"text":"My fiance ordered a new york steak sirloin complete set. He asked for it to be medium rare and it came out to be more well done than it should be. 

I question whether or not they know how to cook their steaks. Anyways, the manager comes around and asks if everything is okay, and we said no cause my fiance was having a super hard time trying to chew it since it was so well done. The manager apologized and offered to give us a medium rare prime rib steak in replacement for the uneaten portion of the new york sirloin. 

The prime rib was amazing like it would melt in your mouth after 2 chews. 
I ordered the seafood sirloin. It wasn't bad but for the price, I expect something better. 

As for dessert, I picked the cheesecake as part of the complete set meal. It looked/tasted like soft cream cheese on top of a graham cracker. The texture was super \"mushy\" , not like any other cheesecakes I've had. 

The pictures I post may look delicious, but it was only \"okay\" for my liking. Most likely won't be coming back as there are other places with better steak for that price."}
{"text":"I love the food there !!
This is my favourite steak house !
The stuff are always nice ,
After each dinner the manager comes to every customer and make sure that they are satisfied with service and  food ."}
{"text":"Came here for a business lunch on a Thursday, made reservations but was not necessary since restaurant was 25% full. Causal open restaurant with a view of the kitchen. Service was very good. Hot bread with whipped butter is always a good start for a meal but their is one of the best complimentary bread, we had to ask for seconds. Lunch was, to start - Fire cracker shrimp that was suppose to be their popular item but for me it was too salty and you could not taste the shrimp because of the heavy spicy sauce and batter. The winner was the strip loin steak sandwich cooked to perfection with onions and mushrooms with a huge portion of their shoe string fries. If you are ever in the neighborhood definitely worth the visit. Will be back for dinner soon."}
{"text":"Had our 9-year anniversary dinner here, and the experience was great!

Me and my fiance reserved through OpenTable, and got seated almost immediately. We were greeted warmly by our server (George), and was quick to get our orders. When we visited on a Friday evening at 7PM, the place was busy, but there are many servers and food came 20 minutes after placing our orders.

My fiance got the $26 10oz sirloin steak dinner with baked potatoe. It was a good kind of meat and no seasoning at all, which is what he prefers.

I had a tavern burger with only cheese, but I added extra bacon for $1. The additional bacon was worth it. I got 4 big pieces of bacon for only $1 extra. After some time, I felt like the burger was a bit dry, but it is not much of a concern, as overall the meal was great! The soup was also very creamy and loaded with ingredients.

To drink, I got a mango smoothie which tasted sooo good, and only cost $4 it was a great choice to drink. The sundae tasted great too, I have no complaints.

Service was great, our server was very polite. I would be coming back."}
{"text":"Their mussels are a great deal. Nice flavour and the matchstick fries are delicious.  I usually order their ribeye steak. It's delicious, and definitely better than Keg's or Canyon Creek.

Friendly service and great price!"}
{"text":"Amazing Service. Amazing Food. Amazing Price. Happy Hour Mon-Friday 3pm-6pm. 8 teriyaki skewers for $10 (and that's not even happy hour pricing). $12 burgers!

What they are truly famous for are the steaks. We went in a group of 5 this time around and all of us got the sirloin 10oz ($25) with matchstick fries and the $7 beer sampler. I requested mine be cooked medium rare and it was perfect. Everyone was completely satisfied with their meal.

Bottom Line: Keg quality steak for a diner type price tag! If you haven't been here yet, you're seriously missing out."}
{"text":"I can't believe it took us this long to try this restaurant. We came here spontaneously and we were able to get a table quickly. We ordered the AYCE mussels which came with a huge portion of shoestring fries. I am not a huge fan of shoestring fries so didn't eat too much of it. I would have liked if it was thick cut fries. For the mussels we found that the flavour can vary, sometimes taste more beer and other times not. Also ordered the 4 lager samples for $7! Great deal.

Our waiter was excellent, and I also noticed the other workers being great as well. The service is very good here and we will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"I Love this place. It is bitter sweet because I miss the old restaurant that was here before (Mother Tuckers) but this Steak house definitely makes you forget quick. Excellent Steaks and  Great brew selections...Can't stress that enough. You can buy a Molson or Labatts anywhere but this place has some \"Craft Beer\" selections. You want fun.....Get those Matchstick Fries. YUMMY!!!!! The Managers of the night even make a point to come by all the tables to make sure everyone is having a good experience. 
 
I have been here about 4 times and most enjoyably be back again soon."}
{"text":"Filet and sirloin were delicious. Only issue was the sauce.  The wine over powered the mushroom"}
{"text":"Walked in before 5pm on Saturday and seated right away. Bear samples are okay (nice server change one from Ottawa to a dark one which tasted like Chinese medical syrup I used to have), will pick myself next time. 

Firecracker shrimps, prime rib sliders, and prime rib platter are must try. Complimentary bread is good but too small we had 2 before meals were served. 

Ale pot pie is nice the meat cubes are bit dry though. 

House Fires taste nice, we were really hungry but finished almost everything, except for prime rib sliders we ordered for our kid but he wasn't into it until the next morning. 

Wish they offer more options for starters.
Will come back with more friends!"}
{"text":"It was a wonderful dinner with my husband and daughter.  The filet mignon and prime rib were very tender and cooked to perfection (medium well for the filet mignon and medium rare for the prime rib).  We've been to other steak houses in the same price range as Smith Bros. and they could never cook the steak as requested. The mussels as well as our sides were delicious!

Our server, Rover, gave very good service.  He was very attentive and nice.

The only downside to the evening was the reaction of the 'unsmiling' manager when we told him about how happy we were of Roven's service.  Instead of being glad about his staff's efforts, he said that Roven did not start out that way and that they had to work with him to get him to the level of good service that he is now giving to his customers.  Did we really need to know this fact about Roven?! All we really cared about was that he was giving us good service during that time.

Anyway, we will be returning to this branch for the excellent food and good service."}
{"text":"I came here with my boyfriend for my birthday last Friday.

We had reservations at 7, we didn't have to wait for a table at all. My boyfriend got the set sirloin, we upgraded to 10oz for 3 dollars. It comes with choice house salad, Caesar or soup; he got the Caesar salad, I really enjoyed the croutons. 

I got the seafood and steak with mash potatoes. The seafood sauce was delicious, it was creamy, buttery and not too salty. We also got the bacon sauce and peppercorn cream. Those two sauce we both didn't enjoy so much. The bacon sauce was overly salty the only flavour I got from it was salt. The peppercorn cream was also very salty.

To finish we ordered the cheesecake. Which the texture was more of a mousse. The flavours were very cheesy with some some berries. 

Overall service and food was a solid 4/5."}
{"text":"Basically if you come on the weekend you will have to make a reservation. nice place with an open kitchen. Super good service, they are attentive. Steaks are awesome!! And out of any other steakhouse, this place did not over cook my steak! 

My friend ordered mussel and they are amazingly fresh! Every piece of mussels and cook on point and fresh! 

Price wise this place is reasonable with the quality of food they serve. Would definitely come back!!"}
{"text":"Heard a lot of great reviews coming into this restaurant. I decided to come here with friends for our Christmas Holiday dinner. Loved the decor here and it's quite a large restaurant has a nice crowd vibe even on a Tuesday!! I ordered the complete meal which comes with your choice of a starter, main course and a dessert. Also ordered a coke and they have free refills which is great since I drink a lot of coke!! For the starter, I chose clam chowder soup, the sirloin with fries and mixed vegetables and the mixed berry. Loved the clam chowder as it was nicely hot and seasoned well. The sirloin was amazing. Perfectly cooked to a medium rare, juicey and seasoned well. I'm a little biased about cheesecake but simply loved this particular cheesecake. Nicely made and you can really taste the cream cheese. It was just right and not too sweet. Service was great and our server was friendly! Definitely worth it for the value that you are paying. Overall, a very positive dining experience from start to finish. A nice gem of a steakhouse located in Scarborough. Highly recommend Smith Bros for great quality steak without the breaking the bank!! Will be back to try of their own menu items!!"}
{"text":"After driving by this place a few times and hearing radio ads, I decided to give it a try.  I made reservations right through the Yelp app using Open Table.

I had the prime rib, and it was pretty good considering I don't always order it at a steakhouse, but the limited availability note on the menu got me to order it.  My gf ordered a steak medium well, but it came out well done.  The matchstick fries reminded me of onion strings - a garish more than a side dish.  

In terms of taste I found it rather flat for my liking with no standout flavors.  I had to ask for horseradish which did help.  I guess I expected more, but I wasn't disappointed either.  Maybe I just hoped for more for a $29 dish.

I'd go back to try a different steak or maybe the mussels, and a craft beer.  The pricing isn't different enough to choose this place over Canyon Creek, which is where I usually think of going for steak."}
{"text":"This was my first time at this restaurant. The staff was kind and friendly. The food is delicious, they give you a good portion of starter, entree and desert. I really recommend this spot!"}
{"text":"Went there on a Saturday evening. Make sure to make reservations. Had the complete prime rib dinner. Salad: Caesar. Amazing! And a large portion. The sour dough bread came out steaming hot and fresh. Prime rib was great. Very comparable to the keg. Desert: mixed berry cheesecake. Very creamy and delicious. Only reason I didn't give this 5 stars was bc of the service. The waitress was slow and it seemed like she was rushing to maintain her tables. There were moments where I thought she forgot about our table. Not to say she wasn't nice, she was pleasant.  However, the servers that brought my party's dinners to the table seemed more personable and genuine."}
{"text":"Went here for a birthday and wasn't disappointed ( but not overly delighted either). The atmosphere and servers were very nice. 

We order both the specialty steaks (Bacon wrapped and seafood). The bacon wrapped steak was ( I think ) filet mignon and it was so tender and basically melt in your mouth. But I would recommend it getting it medium (as opposed to medium rare) because it was a bit too raw and almost slippery in the mouth. The mushrooms that came with the steak was too salty but over all this dish was good. 

The seafood steak was okay. The seafood 'sauce' wasn't flavourful (i can't really describe the flavour) but there were actual large chunks of seafood in the 'sauce' and that was good. The steak itself (i think it was a strip steak?) was a bit too tough and had a lot of spots where it wasn't able to be chewed through. 

Then we had the set of three and it contained a salad, a new york strip (other choices also avail), and a desert (we got the cheesecake). The new york strip was good, better than the steak that came with the seafood steak dish. This set was very reasonably priced. 

The cheesecake was really good, a bit too salty for our taste in some places of the cake itself. We also got a free slice of chocolate cake because we had a birthday! The chocolate cake was so so so so good. it has nuts and ice cream with it and we all really loved it. 

Overall, our experience was good and would come back for another birthday."}
{"text":"Three words: Server Monique sucks! What a miserable person who never smiles. Only reason i'm giving 3 stars is because the food for the most part was good."}
{"text":"Cheap place for a decent steak, but the price probably limits how well your steak can be. Prime rib platter was indeed the best steak in the house but without the sauce it was bland. Too bland. Yorkshire pudding was burnt. Sirloin lacked the distinct meaty taste. Mussels cooked well but the size of the actual mussek was small. Beer sampler a disappointment - the stout was way too bitter, even more than IPAs. My server was awkward. Nice place to be for groups who want to eat steak but is budget conscious. Still you get what you pay for."}
{"text":"This place is an easy 5.   When looking for a great steakhouse in Scarborough this will be my go-to place.
Located across the busy Golden Mile plaza/ Theatre and dodgy parts of this neighborhood Smith Bros. stands out as a mecca for great comfort food.  We came here for my birthday dinner and we were not disappointed.  
The atmosphere is clean, dim, warm and opened with easy sight of the chef's in action as they cook your steak.  The service was efficient and most attentive, same with the manager who would come by to ask if things were okay. You can tell this play prides itself on customer service and quality.
Thursday's they've got a $30 fixed menu special which I'll be back to try.  As for food I decided to try out their infamous Prime Rib platter served served with a bed of mashed potatoes and their Yorkshire!
Jen on the other hand had their Thursday $30 fixed menu with their Prime Rib tower.
Portion-wise its more than enough, actually I barely managed to finish my dish, bang for buck, quality and portions this place is worth it."}
{"text":"Absolutely the BEST steak I have ever had. The food was amazing!!!  The steak was cooked perfectly and melted in your mouth. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Craft beer tasters was good and more of a highlight for me than steaks. Personalized label of each beer was a nice touch.

Bourbon Bacon sauce was quite good. Thing to get is the prime rib platter +matchstock fries. 

Sirloin was avg"}
{"text":"Really great steaks, burgers, great ambience"}
{"text":"Best steaks in the area. I've only ordered their prime rib every time I go. It's juicy and it's made to perfection. I also love the fries!

When I ask for medium rare, it's medium rare."}
{"text":"I came here for a birthday with a large group. The majority of the group arrived 5-10minutes before the reservation time. We were told the table wasn't ready yet. We didn't get our table until it was a few minutes past the reservation time. I already had a bad impression at this point because they didn't have our table ready by the reservation time and the entire group was just standing in the front area blocking other customers. I would expect them to prepare the table before customers come, but nope.

Our table had 20 people and it was divided into three separate tables. This is probably to make it easier for guests to get in/out. When our server brought out bread for the tables, she only brought out two baskets of bread so one table didn't get any bread until they asked for it. Also, we were only assigned one server for a group of 20. 

Food: I ordered the sirloin with the mushroom sauce and fries. I did not like the fries at all because they were so thin and it was like eating strings of oil. The steak was mediocre and bland even when I dip it into the sauce. I had to add salt and pepper on my steak. I tried my friend's prime rib and it was mediocre. 

Not only was the food mediocre but the service was horrible. They brought out my friends birthday cake when some people still had steak on their table... this is probably a sign to us that they were closing and they want us to hurry up. They literally brought the cake out with small plates and placed it on the table for us... I thought this was rude because some people are still finishing their entree. 

Given the service and food. I will definitely not return and I will not recommend this restaurant to anyone."}
{"text":"Took the Rib Steak for $36.  Excellent quality for the price point.  Choice of 4 sauces to eat with the steak.  I tried 3, Peppercorn, Bourbon, and Mushroom Cabernet.  They are all very good.  Steak is expensive food, and I feel this is really good value for the money.  I would skip the complete, as no Rib steak is offered.  Even for a New York Striploin, if you can live without dessert, you can get a 14 oz, 4 more oz than with a complete, plus a salad for only $4 more.  If you're going out for steak already, might as well eat more meat and skip the sweets."}
{"text":"My cousin keepx telling me how bang for buck this place is. It's all corn fed steaks! Feels like a repurposed building. They could make the bathrooms nicer to fit the lure of a steakhouse. Steaks arent that tasty. The seasoning will do the most woek with store bought marbling for the beef. Good portions though. Service is.. friendly"}
{"text":"Fantastic. The prime rib is so tender, the fire cracker shrimp awesome and the berry cheesecake rocks. The service is out of this world. We have been there several times and always fantastic. Ask for George! Well worth the drive to Scarborough."}
{"text":"I stopped in here one night after reading all the awesome reviews. I was excited to try it since it is not too far from where I live and I am always looking for new restaurants to try.

However I was rather disappointed, the inside is still the same Tucker's I remember being there and does not give off that relaxing atmosphere feel as Tucker's was a buffet. They still even have the buffet setup! 

Maybe when I am in the mood for a steak I will give this place another try, I am rather disappointed ..."}
{"text":"The food here is horrible, food was dry and unflavorful. Food took awhile cause they only had one guy doing all the cooking. I don't recommend this place not a place I'm going back to eat."}
{"text":"The prime rib is delicious! The sirloin wasn't as moist or tender as the prime rib. I would stick to the prime rib next time I go again. The matchsticks were nice and thin, and very crispy. The garlic mash potatoes was creamy and buttery. 

The Yorkshire pudding that came with the prime rib was crispy and puffy but it didn't have much taste. The bread that with the table was awesome! Moist and warm.

If you tell the waiter it's your birthday or if you are going for a birthday celebration, they will bring you a chocolate brownie with a scoop of ice cream, and a lovely birthday melody free of charge. A nice and generous touch! 

The ambience and service was good. Nothing to complain about. I am giving this place a 3 instead of 4 because I didn't like my dish (sirloin) as much, but if I got the prime rib, it would be a 4+."}
{"text":"I had high hopes for Smith Bros, but meh, I've had better. At this price point, I will stick to The Keg. 

Very casual space.  Caesar salad was good and basic.

I had the Seafood Sirloin - topped with small chunks of lobster/shrimp in a lobster-bisque-type sauce. Asked for medium rare but it was overcooked and lacked flavor - even though it was pink as a med rare should be, I just felt like it was rough and not juicy. Matchstick fries were ok, prefer the mashed potatoes. The New York Strip was a bit better than the sirloin."}
{"text":"This place gets really busy during dinner hours. So depends which days you'd like to visit, it's safe to make a reservation.

My first time here was to try their Thanksgiving menu. And I was very impressed with the food, service, and ambient. Second time here was to try their burger and sandwiches, they were excellent too. The matchstick that came with the burger was delicious. 

I'd prob go back and try their steak, after all, thats what they're known for."}
{"text":"I was drawn to this place because many people compared it to The Keg, which is my favourite steak restaurant due to consistency and reasonable prices. When i checked out Smith Bros.' menu online I couldn't believe the wide price point from $12 burgers to $35 prime rib platter. Awesome.
So I came here with a group of 10, and everyone was pretty satisfied with the meal, for the most part. 
We had table-side guacamole, which was tasty, although the chips that came with it were pretty salty. We had a rib-eye, prime rib, bacon wrapped fillet and some burgers. The bacon wrapped fillet came rare, when ordered medium rare, so it was sent back and seared again. 
The prime rib and rib-eye were very good, but I prefer the prime rib a bit more because it was more tender. 
They also brew their own beer and have a very cheap wine list. You can get a whole bottle of wine here for $25-$35 which is amazing! 

The restaurant atmosphere is very casual and pretty loud, it was hard for me to hear the person diagonal from me. The service was good, I found it could have been better, as in, the waitress could have came around more often - there were a few times I was looking around for her and she was no where in sight. 

The manager came by a few times to address the under cooked fillet which was nice, and he ensured that the person whom had to wait for the under cooked steak was comfortable and offered a complimentary soup or salad which was nice. 

I enjoy the ambiance of the Keg more, because it's not as loud, however at Smith Bros, the great prices will keep me coming back and of course I will update my Yelp review at that time."}
{"text":"This is my new favourite steakhouse! Woot!

I've been here twice and both times the food has been consistently yummy.  I always get the prime rib (medium rare) - can't go wrong there.  

The bread they serve is very similar (if not the same) as the one The Keg USED to serve that was super awesome, seemed to be freshly baked, soft, and delicious. 

In terms of sides, the matchstick fries are cool and fun to eat - super thinly sliced. I wish they had a bit of seasoning on them like frites. 

The mashed potatoes are pretty typical.  What you need to try is eating matchstick fries with the mashed potatoes - epic potato-ness. 

The one thing that would make this place even better (and something I would strongly recommend), is that they should replicate the DOUBLE BAKED POTATO that The Keg serves.  Dang, that would be heaven.

Okay enough about potatoes. Moving on.

The old fashioned ice cream is underwhelming - only tried one type (pralines and cream with bourbon or something?) and it wasn't very flavourful. 

The service is really great too. The first time we came here, my brother's steak was overcooked and the waitress asked him immediately before he cut his steak.  She offered to make a new steak, but my brother said it was fine.  The waitress then told the Manager, and he personally came over and tried to convince my brother to cook him a new steak. Again my brother refused since he was fine with it.  So the Manager decided to comp his glass of beer to make up for it. What a nice fellow.  When we were paying the bill, the waitress apologized again about the steak.  Dang.  Good service."}
{"text":"We were craving steak and came here for an early Christmas dinner.

Smith Bros is a very spacious steakhouse that serves top notch steaks at reasonable prices.

We ordered the house special prime rib and rib-eye

Prime Rib Platter (12oz for $35)
This player was absolutely delicious. It came with Yorkshire pudding, garlic and cream mashed potatoes and au jus and horse radish on the side. It was cooked perfectly at medium rare and was definitely larger than the advertised 12oz. The prime rib was moist, tender and very flavourful. One downside was the Yorkshire pudding came cold and as a result, chewy. The au jus was delectable and the horse radish was fresh and fiery.

Rib-Eye Steak (14oz for $38)
This is my go to cut as I like my steak with a lot of beefy flavour. It came perfect at medium rare with beautiful grilled cross-hatch marks and was served with shoe string French fries. These fries were absolutely amazing as they were super thin and crispy. Steaks come with a choice of sauces and I selected the peppercorn cream which was absolutely delist and complemented the rib-eye steak perfectly.

This is an absolute gem of Steakhouse and would definitely recommend people to visit. You get excellent steaks for the price in a comfortable atmosphere."}
{"text":"Tonight, my extended family and I had a fantastic experience at this steakhouse. Everything was perfect, the meat was mouth watering and as one family member put it \"downtown food at uptown prices\"...or something like that.

The meal started with freshly baked, melt in your mouth bread. Buns quarterly cut to prevent the awkward slicing of the rolls. 

They have a simple one page menu that focuses primarily on steak and prime rib. They also have 'complete' meals which include an app, main and dessert. They also have a full drinks menu with 3, 4, and 5 star wines available, along with, craft beers, cocktails, smoothies, and non-alcoholic choices.

There were too many in our group to describe what everyone had so I'll just focus on the highlights:

-Everyone's meat was prepared perfectly.
-The sides were flavourful and filling. With the string fries garnering the most interest.
-I had the chicken Marsala which was delicious!
-Half of us had the ice cream for dessert which exceeded expectations.
-None of us left hungry.

Atmosphere was welcoming to the kids in our group while still being quiet enough to hold a conversation. The server was on the ball and the manager dropped by to ensure everything met/exceeded expectations. Special requests were fulfilled as though the restaurant had come up with the idea.

Prices were beyond reasonable for the type of restaurant. I think most of us would not hesitate to come back. Definitely five stars!"}
{"text":"Scarborough can be a difficult place to find a good steak. However, this is one place that I would definitely return to. Saturday night-make reservations! Our server was prompt and very attentive. 
The atmosphere can get quite noisy, and it certainly isn't a \"fine dining\" experience, so for a nice quiet date with your SO I wouldn't recommend it. However I do appreciate the open concept such that you can see the kitchen in action...and let's face it, we all watch to see when our dishes come out. 
The prime rib platter was exceptional, cooked to a perfect medium rare. Very satisfying and very filling. My gf ordered the New York strip, also cooked perfectly and still full of flavour. Two very delicious steaks.
Dessert...was a disappointment however. The ice cream was something recommended by our server, but I have to say I would have appreciated it more had it not been covered in whipped cream. 
Overall, a good experience and I will definitely return for some of the best steak in Scarborough."}
{"text":"PARKING
Lots of parking in a big plaza. I do note the location is easy to miss as the restaurant is not by the road. 

AMBIANCE/SERVICE
Dim-lit, very western style restaurant with dark wood and clunky chandeliers. Spacious booths and round tables available for guests. The round table comfortably sat my group of 5. 

Service is great! Host asked if we had a reservation and promptly seated us. Our server introduced himself and gave us time to think over the menu. He also told a couple jokes and gave recommendations for the indecisive (me) in the group. I note he forgot one of our drinks (distracted by his own joke maybe?) and double charged us on the bill after. A quick word with him resolved the issue though. 

FOOD
We all ordered rib eye steaks. Peppercorn sauce was flavored well; you can see some whole peppercorns in the gravy boat. Generous portion of delicious mashed potatoes - I barely finished half of mine. Baked potatoes were standard. Steak is aged well and juicy. My boyfriend commented on how tender it was. They do have quite a few craft beers on offer as well. I note their desserts lean towards the sweeter side. 

VALUE
Priced competitively with other steak chains (Keg, Moxies, etc.). The combos are well priced too, at ~$7 for soup/salad plus dessert.

OVERALL
5 stars. For service and quality of food offered, the price is well worth it. Would return for special occasions only because the location is far from home."}
{"text":"This was my second time coming here because I wanted to try some of the appetizers that others have recommended or taken nice photos of. On Thursday, they hand out sample glasses of their drafts, and I tried a nice dark beer. Ordered the guacamole, PEI mussels, prime rib dip (with matchstick fries) and mushroom pan.

The meal starts with a nice bread roll served warm in a basket. It's always do much better when it comes out warm. The guacamole is mixed up right at the table so that was fun. The taste was ok. The mussels come in a large bowl, and smelled wonderful, but I found the taste only alright. I was honestly a little disappointed because it smelled better than it tasted. The mussels were small and overall the dish was a little underwhelming, especially given the good reviews here. Prime rib dip was good, maybe a little salty and could have used more horseradish. Mushrooms were great!

Service here is friendly, and though a little disappointed, I'd probably come back again some time."}
{"text":"I decided to try Smith Brothers for lunch, based on recent good reviews that I read. My dining companion and I were not disappointed! The food was excellent and the service even better!

We were greeted and seated promptly in a very friendly manner. Our server's knowledge of the menu was impressive and he was very engaging. We started with his recommendation of Beau's Lug-Tread, one of several craft beers on tap. Very good! He guided us through the menu and offered his personal favourites. I'm sorry I can't remember his name but he's originally from South Africa, via Australia.

We settled on the Prime Rib Dip and a 7oz Sirloin steak with peppercorn sauce, with matchstick fries for both. Good choices! Everything was perfectly cooked and flavourful! The matchstick fries were nice and crispy. We also ordered a side of mushrooms and the kitchen accommodated our request for portabellos instead of their regular offering.

The restaurant was clean and spacious with decor that suggests elegance and tradition. I'm a fan of the open kitchen!

Overall, a very enjoyable experience and worthy of another visit!"}
{"text":"Came here for the first time with my parents for a birthday celebration and this place made a really good first impression.  Service was great from start to finish, with the manager checking at each table to make sure everyone was happy.  Our server was friendly and helpful.  The food was great.  Had the steak sausage and ale pot pie with a huge mound of mashed potatoes which was delicious. The sirloin steak was tender and done perfectly. Definitely worth coming back to again."}
{"text":"I love coming back here, it serves the best ribeye, prime rib and great beers in an unassuming casual spot. The matchstick fries are so good, the veggie sides always fresh. Haven't had the chance to try their desserts as i always finish the 14oz steak and no more room for dessert. Prices are decent and servers are very prompt. Always worth a visit."}
{"text":"One of my fav steak house in town.  Love all kind of steak in here, but I always order the steak with peppercorn cream and matchstick fries.

AYCE mussels is also very good too.

All the dishes here go well with beer (of course!).  Love their tavern sampler, which I can have 4 different kind of beers at the same time :-D"}
{"text":"We ordered the table side guacamole and 2 sirloin steaks. The apps were good - big portion. 1 sirloin was tender but the second sirloin (asked for medium rare) was tough as leather (and the sides were not correct). Manager came back and asked if I would like prime rib to replace it, so I agreed. The prime rib was tender but full of fat. 

Don't think I'll be back here."}
{"text":"The quality of their steak never fails my expectation.  Their prime rib is so juicy and tender! Their matchstick fries and sundae is also my favourite!  Definitely a hidden Gem."}

Hi and welcome to another episode of javing it with Javier. Let's see what we are javing today. My friend has been hyping this place for a long time and each time I've been reluctant to go because its so far. But I was craving some steak and decided to go.

Looking at the menu, there were so many steaks to choose from, but I ended up picking the prime rib platter because it said it was limited quantity so it must be popular right? And for $8 more I could add an appetizer and dessert to it? Count me in! The appetizer came first, I wanted to eat a bit healthy so I ordered the house salad. It was not bad, but my friend's clam chowder was soooo much better. The salad was quite big though. I could feel the salad filling me up, hope I have enough space for the steak. The steak looked so good when it came and cutting through it I could tell that it was well cooked and cooked evenly throughout. The steak was so tender as the juices overwhelmed my taste buds. I have got to say this is one of the best steak places in the GTA. I tried my friend's rib eye steak and that was also very good. Although both steaks were really good, I think I enjoyed the texture of his steak more so I will be getting that next time. The bread and mashed potatoes that accompanied it was also very good. Unfortunately I was too full at that point and had to forfeit the rest of it as I needed to save some space for dessert. I'm a huge fan of cheesecake so I naturally picked their mixed berry cheesecake. It was OK, not phenomenal but still pretty good. 

Service was great as expected from a fancy place like this. She dropped by quite frequently to check up on our meal and did a very good job in answering all our questions.

The steaks here were very reasonably priced and the sizes are great. Some steakhouses would only give you a 10oz or 8oz steak for this price. I was even more surprised that they gave so much mashed potato and bread sides as well. The $8 addition to add an app and dessert made this meal a steal for $43. I could spend that amount for just one piece of steak at other places without all the additions. 

In conclusion, I really liked this steak place and will definitely come back whenever I am craving steak. The steaks are very well priced and are huge as well. Next time though, I will hold back on the app and dessert because there was just too much food! That's it for today's episode of javing it with Javier. And remember food is life!"}
{"text":"I came here for the Thursday special which seemed like a good deal - $30 for three items. However, after looking at the menu, I don't think this is necessarily the best choice if you want steak since the steak in the special is quite small (7oz). I opted for the 14oz ribeye - it was cooked perfectly to medium rare. The fries were great too (crispy and thin) but I think the gravy was just ok (a bit watered down, not much flavor). 

The decor of the restaurant was a brewery style theme with an open kitchen. It's definitely comfortable for both small and big groups - can feel intimate with the booths but at the same time accommodate a larger party as well. Service was great!"}
{"text":"First time at the Smith Brothers. Got the sirloin with peppercorn sauce and mash potatoes. The steak was cooked nicely but the taste wasn't to my satisfactory. I've had better which I'm sad to say. The service was amazing and our server made sure our drinks were topped off and checked up on us a few times. Sad to give this place only 3 stars but maybe I'll give it a try and have something else on the menu."}
{"text":"Yum! This is easily one of my favourite places to dine in the Scarborough area! Whenever I have a craving for some good steak near home I come here.

I've only ever been for the dinner service, so I can't speak for what its like during lunch hours, but I have never seen this place packed - there always seem to be lots of tables available. 

Service is always great, servers are always really friendly, knowledgeable, and are always really attentive but not overbearing.

They have some set prix fixe menus ranging between the 25-35 dollar range - great value!

I usually opt for the house salad (crumbled, double-smoked bacon,
chopped egg, croutons, dijon vinaigrette) for the app - simple but always fresh and delicious!

Last time I was here I had the 7 oz sirloin - I can always rely on them to cook my steak exactly to my liking here! Each time you order a steak you get a choice of three sauces to accompany them (Peppercorn Cream, Mushroom Cabernet, Teriyaki, and Crumbled Bacon & Bourbon). I tried the peppercorn the first time & loved it so I haven't tried the others yet, but the bacon & bourbon sounds really good so I think I may try that next!

The desserts here are HUGE. Seriously, I am lucky if I can ever finish half of one! I've tried both the creme brule and the triple chocolate brownie - a little plain but a-okay, but really, the steak is the star here & the desserts don't compare.

They don't have much of a set drink list, but if you let the server know what you're in the mood for they will have the bartender whip something up. The smoothies here are also pretty awesome if you want something non-alcoholic!

If you're in the Scarborough area & looking for some awesome food at a great price stop by! I know I'll be back soon :)"}
{"text":"Service: 1 star (for everyone else), 5 stars for our waiter Jose!
Ambiance:  3 stars, comfortable enough but rather confusing with different mix of crowd.
Food:  3 stars

We arrived without a reservation on a Saturday evening and as we were walking in, we noticed a car parked right in front of the restaurant with its headlight still on.  Upon entering, we informed the staff at the front (3 of them milling about doing not much of anything) and they said, \"oh, you mean the Nissan Altima?  Yeah, what can you do.\"  This made a terrible first impression right from the start.  You would think that they could have made an effort to find the owner by asking around to save someone the hassle of calling CAA after dinner?  Maybe that's too much to expect at Smith Bros.  

We were told that there would be a 15 min wait for the table but we could wait at the bar area (very spacious) and get some appetizers or drinks while waiting.  We sat down with a menu they handed us at the front and waited for someone to come and take a drink order.  The staff here were also just milling about (4 of them including the bartender) and didn't bother to come over to take our order until we flagged one of them down.  We tried their beer sampler (4 little glasses for $8) which was decent.  

We were seated and our server promptly came over to take our order and in fact, his efficiency as our server is what made me give Smith Bros. a 3 star rating.  We each order a glass of red (limited selection but moderately priced) and I opted for their prime rib dinner and my husband, their ribeye dinner.  

First to arrive was their warm bread in a basket with whipped butter.  Then our wine arrived and it was starting to feel like a nice evening out.  Our food arrived without too much delay and looked good.  The portions are quite large here and the kitchen obliged my husband's request to Chicago his ribeye to medium rare.  The steak was ok but the real scene-stealer here was the prime rib.  It was juicy, tender and well-seasoned, accompanied by a good size flaky Yorkie and a mound of garlicky mashed potatoes.  I would say the prime rib here is 10 times better than the Keg's.  

We opted out of dessert option as we were both pretty full from our mains.  With 2 glasses of wine and 2 mains, the bill came to $120+ tax and tip.  Would I go out of my way to revisit Smith Bros. for my next steak craving?  Not likely.  But I may consider coming back for more beers and happy hour appetizers."}
{"text":"Firstly, this is certainly a welcome addition to the big chain restaurants and poorly run diners that dot this area. 

No question their steaks are simply divine and mine was cooked perfectly medium rare. The local craft beer and sampler concepts are excellent, delicious and fun.  

Where this resto needs work is its attention to everything else on the menu, and especially the side dishes.  The house salad although basic was fresh and delicious. The Ceasar was a poor attempt at a easy classic. Just plain romaine and barely enough dressing. A place like this should dress up a Caesar with a thinly sliced dry cheese, and maybe house made bacon strips. Also I counted only 4 little uninspiring crouton pieces I my pathetic Caesar. Ah we'll I didn't come for salad. The matchstick fries are so delicious but more of a garnish than a side. Very difficult to eat without mashing it on your face. 

The chicken Marsala served a generous breast but alas it was overdone. The sauce, sides and presentation were not bad however. 

The triple chocolate Brownie cake sounded promising but clearly was not made fresh. The sponge of the cake was dry as if it had sat in the fridge for days. The apple dessert however was quite delicious. The ice cream is a nice touch. 

One last minor issue: our server had no idea about beer.  For a place featuring craft beer this seems rather unusual. 

The pricing is incredible for the food and drink they're serving. I do recommend you come here to eat, just stick to steak and you'll be fine. Definitely for the area this place is outstanding comparatively."}
{"text":"Not a bad steak house around mid town Toronto.    I like the rustic and casual feel inside.   The waiter was attentive.   First time here, I wanted medium rare but I got medium well done.  So this is the reason, I have to give them 3 stars.  I would go again but hopefully they won't mess up my steak order.   

We spend $120 for two people and only 1 sample beers we order.  No wine."}
{"text":"I love everything about this place. Located in a huge plaza so ample parking.
Huge open kitchen so you can see your meal being prepared if you get a seat close enough.

Excellent, fast, friendly service.

Prime rib dip with steak chowder soup $16 - One word will describe the whole dish. PERFECTION

Farm house salad $12 - I'm not a big salad eater but I have to say this was the best salad I have ever eaten. There were so many ingredients. Copied directly from the website menu (mixed greens, goat cheese, red beets, edamame, dried cranberry, toasted pumpkin and sunflower seeds, balsamic vinaigrette). I have never had red beets before and I must say RED BEETS are f***ing awesome.

Next time I'm coming back to try their steaks."}
{"text":"Overall the experience was quite disappointing tonight. My wife and I went to celebrate an early Valentine's. 

I ordered the prime rib complete meal while my wife ordered the mussels and fries. The waiter forgot the salad for my meal and instead we were served the main course right away. I had to cancel the complete meal and just make it a regular meal as I did not want to eat my salad after the main course.

My wife's mussels and fries were quite delicious. However my prime rib meal was very underwhelming. It is advertised as a 12 oz cut but unfortunately around 3-4 oz's of it was pure inedible fat. It was very unappetizing to see the large cuts fat on the plate. By the time I cut out the fat, there was probably only around 8 oz of actual meat to eat. 

Also at the end of the meal, the waiter made a snide comment on how I helped my wife eat the mussels but that he wouldn't say anything since he forgot my salad. This made things extremely uncomfortable and my wife agreed right there that we would never return. 

We have been to the restaurant several times prior with no issues. Unfortunately Smith Bros really dropped the ball tonight. The overall experience was quite unpleasant."}
{"text":"3.5 stars.

I wasn't a big fan of the teriyaki sauce on my filet mignon. The baked potato and ceaser salad were quite tasty!"}
{"text":"Been here twice now and great experience each time. My favourite is the prime rib. Made the mistake of not ordering it the first time here and ordered ribeye which ended up being dry. But prime rib was done perfectly. Items are priced reasonably and I believe even cheaper than the keg. They have different craft beers available. On weekdays, there's a different promo everyday. Servers are great (manager appeared a little odd tho, snooping around...funny to watch). Place is clean and big. They have a small area for the bar section. I noticed they had 2 rooms with sliding doors....probably for bigger parties. Overall experience was good and would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Extremely disappointed with so many good yelp reviews.

It was nice that we could hang out at the lounge while we waited 30 mins for our table. The girls at the front were also nice and friendly. Our waiter however, not so much.

The prime disappointment was our STEAKS in this \"steakhouse\". The meat itself was pretty sad. It was very chewy, and dry. We got the rib eye and the striploin both rare. We also ordered a side of sauteed mushrooms - it was SO VERY VERY salty. We downed so much water after.

For such an establishment to serve such low quality meat, we will not be back. Hard earned dollars should never be wasted like this. Once, and never again.

Prices are too high for the quality they provide."}
{"text":"Smith Bros is a breath of fresh air for Scarborough. Nice interior, amazing food, large portions, plenty of seating and a great beer selection seals the deal. 

The menu obviously excels in it's aged steak, but has enough variety that it will fill almost everyone's requirements. The all you can eat Mussels and skinny fries were excellent and the envy of the table! The Burger was huge and juicy, and  the house salad was surprisingly good!

The must have though is the half yard of ale! This huge glass may look intimidating but realistically only has about 2 pints of beer in it. It's makes for a great photo and a memorable meal.

I'll definitely be coming back again, and again to this place! It just has everything a restaurant should!"}
{"text":"First glance when we pulled in the parking lot for dinner....Oh great this is a typical chain restuarant, we'll I was pleasantly suprised by the food selection and how well the food was prepared. They say first impressions are everything and this one did not disappoint. I will definitely go back. I got the prime rib dinner and the medium rare prime rib melted in my mouth. The flavor and tenderness of it was perfect and would definitely recommend it. The shoe string fries (yes I got it with the prime rib even though everyone seems to rave about the garlic mash potatoes) were awesome. The staff was extremely helpful and friendly also. Will be back."}
{"text":"Very nice.  Good place for an awesome prime-rib dip sandwich.  Delicious salad as well.  When you get that craving, this is definitely the place to go!"}
{"text":"This resturant is a meat lover's haven! My parents and I were looking for a new spot to go to as my dad was craving a steak but didn't wish to go to the usual places we'd head to. So with the help of Yelp, I came upon Smith Bros and suggested it to my parents who agreed to try it. 

When entering the resturant, a large sign was hung over by the open concept kitchen which read, \"28 Day Wet Aged Steaks\", which highly intrigued me and got me more excited for a juicy steak. Both my dad and I got the prime rib dinners, my dad ordering it with the lobster sauce and me getting it with the mushroom sauce. The cut of the meat and how it was juicy and cooked medium rare was perfect I almost forgot to eat it with my sauce which just amplified the flavors even more! I also have to mention the matchstick cut fries which came with my prime rib that I chose as my side. It was something diffrent to me and somewhat reminded me of eating hickory stick chips, nonetheless it was fun and yummy to eat! The shiitake mushroom soup which came as a choice of side and was what my mum and dad chose for their meals was wonderful, as it was rich in flavor and loaded with plenty of mushrooms! My mum on the who had opted for a lighter meal and wasn't feeling for poultry, went for a salmon as well as the Smith Bros salad. She highly enjoyed her meal as well as she said everything was beautifully seasoned and her salmon was cooked to a perfect tenderness. 

Although stuffed after eating every bite of our delicious meal, my parents and I agreed that we wanted to order a dessert to share. We went with the mixed berry cheesecake which was a good way to wrap up the meal as it was fairly light and the perfect mix of sweet and tartness. 

Our server was also lovely in recommending beers to go with our meals and was also very attentive in coming to offer more water, pepper for our food, and overall asking how are meal was going. Overall a lovely restaurant that I'd love to go back to."}
{"text":"I don't know why I didn't discover this place sooner. Definitely a keeper! Totally a gem :) 

From reading the reviews, I knew this was more family style steak house - perfect for me because my family loves steak! Really nice ambiance, very clean, super duper friendly service. 

Got free beer of the day samples for everyone in our dinner party. Woot woot! We also ended up ordering a Beer Sampler - 4 samples for $7 - a steal! Steam Whistle tastes good with steak!

Then out came the complementary warm and oh-so-soft bread served with whipped butter. I asked for seconds. In fact, I'd pay good money to eat this bread. 

Our party got the:
- NY Striploin with half lobster, served with mashed p and peppercorn cream sauce
- Fillet Mignon with half lobster, served with frites and mushroom cabernet sauce
- Salmon filet with mashed p
- Chicken Marsala x 2
- Side house salad

Okay now onto the review of the food.. I leaned over and helped myself to everyone's food so I can write this review. Only for you guys fellow yelpers. I am usually one who keeps to myself :P

Striploin cooked medium is FABULOUS. A very very memorable steak. I'm strictly eating this cut from now on. The mashed p was creamy garlicky and delicious. I heart the peppercorn cream sauce. Better than the mushroom wine sauce. The fillet mignon was so tender and cooked really nicely but I like a bit more of a bite to my steak. This one just melted in my mouth. Lobster was a good size and served with warm butter. Lobster was cooked perfectly, not over cooked, was sweet and totally worth it. The chicken marsala and the salmon were both tender and juicy as well. The side salad was enough to serve 3 people. Kinda surprising because now I wonder how many the regular dinner salad can serve.... It was a bit waterly though but everyone else seemed to love it.

I wasn't a big fan of their dessert. The berry cheesecake was very mousse like and not the texture of cheesecake I like. They surprised our birthday girl with a free chocolate brownie that was super sweet and gigantic. Even with 6 mouths, we didn't finish it. The prailine and cream ice cream served on top of the brownie was a hit. Loved it!

Did I mention the service was amazing?"}
{"text":"Had lunch here a couple of weeks ago and I would call it a solid 3. It's near the office otherwise I don't know that I would make the effort again. I had a nice salmon filet with baked potato and a side of delicious mushrooms that I shared with my companions.

I have had their salads before which are large and a good lunch choice. I find some of the ingredients they combine together in their salads to be odd. That said, two of my companions enjoyed their salads while the other had a tasty sandwich with frites.

Service was good, space was clean and comfortable."}
{"text":"I came into Smith Bros for their Thursday special. This steakhouse is located in a big box plaza in Scarborough, it has a decent warehouse like vibe for a rather uneventful location that is in the land of the car.

The $30 special comes with a drink, appetizer and an entree. They call it \"three course\" but I really don't feel a drink is a course.

I got their own beer, it was actually quite good, and I would consider buying it at Beer Store if they sell it there. I got some beef soup that was decent. The main course was a steak and fries. It was nicely grilled and comes with shoestring fries. I think the steak was made from sous vide and then it was grilled afterwards. I didn't think it was amazing, but the steak itself was quite good, it was one of the better steak experiences I've had.

The service was exceptional. Would come again for a special occasion."}
{"text":"I've been here 3-4 times and every time's been a delight. 

The food is delicious! The things you must try are the house salad and prime rib. Seriously, the house salad is AMAZING. 

I haven't tried their new desserts, but the desserts previously (there were only 3 before) - I could pass on... (And the reason for -1 star)."}
{"text":"Went to Smith Bros. for my birthday last night and as expected, great turnout! Me and my fiancee had the 7oz sirloin and the french cut pork chop....the steak was cooked a a beautiful medium rare as asked for and my pork chop.....well....probably one of the best I've ever eaten....perfect doneness, juicy and flavourful...i usually don't order pork in a restaurant because 9 times out of 10 it's dry....its not a very forgiving piece of protein! But overall, Smith Bros. is a fantastic joint; great beers and awesome steaks and chops...I'll have to swing by for beer this coming week as they have cask fest going on. Cheers!"}
{"text":"Came here in a date night, ordered one complete meal (salad, main & side, dessert) and one main by itself. Portions were generous and more than enough. We got the sirloin and chicken marsala, both deliciously cooked!"}
{"text":"Came here for dinner with a large group of friends - pretty comfortable seating! While everyone ordered prime rib (their specialty) and steak, I was attracted by their AYCE Mussels and Fries! They didn't have enough mussels left that night to take my order for AYCE but our server did offer the Appetizer Mussels option ($12) which apparently is the same size as the first bucket of mussels they give you in the AYCE option. So I went for that and ordered myself a side order of mash potatoes. Turns out the portion of mussels you get for the appetizer is very decent. I gave some to my friends here and there and still got very full towards the end...now I did also have mash potato. The quality of the mussels were just so so, but given the price I think I got what I paid for!"}
{"text":"I really wish I could give this place a five star. Really wish.  The food is outstanding. We went for my birthday dinner and ordered the surf and turf, appetizer and dessert.  Wow. it was delicious and plentiful.  But the service.  Below meh. When we were seated, the waiter approached our table. He asked if we had been there and seemed relieved we had and knew how to order. I told him it was my birthday, and it was met with silence. So we ordered. Our appetizer and beer came a bit later.  And then he disappeared. We cleaned up our table, and I snuck around to the front desk to get a menu as I was wanting to order a glass of wine with dinner. Fortunately another waiter must have found our orders waiting to be served and he brought us over our dinners.  I asked him for a glass of wine.  I just felt like we were completely forgotten. As we had too much food for two people, I asked for the rest to take home. He dropped a bag and a container at our table, and I had to ask him for our dessert.. we weren't ready to go yet.  Overall, a two star for a birthday dinner, a three star for a regular dinner (and if they could get their service better)  it could definitely be a 4 or 5 star restaurant."}
{"text":"Pros:
Ample seating
Very friendly service

Cons:
Steak \"needed\" the sauce

I'm always looking for a great steak at a good price.  It's why I like the Keg.  You can get a very decent steak there without breaking the bank.  I found Smith Bros. thanks to yelp and you can put them in the good steak good value category as well.

Smith Bros. does have that tavern feel to it.  It's on the louder side atmosphere wise.  This place is more suited for a celebration than for an intimate night.  They have plenty of seating here.  The place looks much bigger inside than it does outside.  For most nights you can get away with not having a reservation.  On holidays, you're better off safe than sorry with a reservation.

So every time I go to a new steakhouse, I always order the rib steak.  It's by far my fav and if you don't have one, I don't even bother with you, lol.  I ordered that and my wife got the all you can eat mussels.  My little one picked up some chicken fingers from the kids menu.  I do want to mention that our server was excellent throughout the night.  He had a large group to contend with but he managed to always get back to the rest of his tables were OK.

Smith Bros. does a pretty good steak.  I was pretty good with it.  The steak sauce is the conundrum I face here.  A great steak should not need any sauce.  It should just be salt and pepper and grilled to perfection.  I almost felt the steak \"needed\" the sauce to be the best it can be.  It's a tiny nitpick, but when you're talking steak, every little detail matters.  It's still a really good steak, don't get me wrong.  My wife's oysters were pretty good, not the best, but still good.  They come in a huge portion every order.  There has to be about 25-30 mussels per order so you get your fill here.  

All in all, Smith Bros. is a pretty awesome place to get a good steak at a pretty good price.  I still prefer my go to for this category, but you can't go wrong here either."}
{"text":"Great service. They made room for our stroller. Delicious food!! The steak was perfect."}
{"text":"I came here with my boyfriend for date night after he recommended this restaurant to me.

My boyfriend got the steak combo (comes with soup, steak and dessert) and I got the filet mignon.

I made him get the clam chowder for the starter and it was very flavourful. It wasn't overly salty (like Jack Astor's) which is usually my complaint with most restaurant's soups. My boyfriend was enjoying the complimentary bread and it was so delicious we had to get seconds.

My filet mignon was cooked perfectly rare. I had a side of garlic mash and it tasted extra good with my side of gravy. I also stole some of his matchstick fries from his main meal and it's definitely what I'm getting as my side the next time.

Lastly, we upgraded our dessert to a vanilla creme brulee and it was worth the extra few bucks. It was one of the best dessert I've ever had.

I'm in love with this restaurant! The food was great, the service was awesome, the ambiance was perfect and the price was decent."}
{"text":"I've been coming to Smith Bros for special occasions for years and their food has never disappoint.
Interior decor is old school and on the casual side for steakhouses, the open kitchen is beautiful.
This time we got their spinach \"fondue\" (more of a dip). The dip was very standard, regular tasty goodness, nothing stands out from other spinach dips though. The chips were housemade, slightly greasy for my taste. There was also way too much dip, so more chips would have been nice.
Their complimentary bread is also super fluffy and warm!
Mains - this is one of the only restaurants that I will comfortably order any cut on the menu and know it is good. I usually go for either a prime rib or a NY. Cook is always on point, beautiful sear, good seasoning with tasty horse radish, au jus or sauce. I love the au jus and black pepper sauce, but the steak taste great without anything as well. Their matchsticks fries are also so special and good - I can totally eat them by the bucket.
To end a meal, their house made spiked ice cream is quite good as well :)"}
{"text":"Love this place! Amazing food and great service every time!!

The mussels are incredible and a huge quantity. 

Steak is just as good as the keg and prime rib is to die for!

Atmosphere works well for any size party whether it's an intimate dinner, work party or bringing the kids! 

They also always have different beer companies promoting products, and who doesn't love free beet?!?"}
{"text":"Clean and professional but unremarkable otherwise. Had the rib eye, was nicely grilled but not memorable in any way. Peppercorn sauce was average, fries were average , and worst of all the cut of beef itself was average. Service was acceptable but not stand out. All in all a triumph in mediocrity. For this money, you can do better."}
{"text":"Great place for steak!!!!!

I love steak!! This place is your traditional steakhouse!! We had a party of 6, food was great!! You can't really go wrong with a steakhouse that serves high quality meat and specializes is steaks and steak side dishes.. 

Overall, a great place to eat restaurant quality AAA beef! Yummmmm

Love the atmosphere,

Comparable to Baton Rouge quality, service, and price."}
{"text":"Amazing food, great atmosphere, and on Thursdays free Draft beer sampling. Fast, friendly, and attentive service."}
{"text":"This was my first-ever experience at a steakhouse. My partner's family made reservations weeks ahead for a group of 9. We were greeted by a host and seated immediately upon arrival. We sat next to the open concept kitchen, so you can see how your food is prepared. Surprisingly, there was no smell that I was disturbed by despite being seated next to the kitchen. We were offered menus and drinks. We took about 10-15 minutes to sift through the menu, but when we were ready to order, we noticed zero waiters to be found. I noticed it was 6pm and a bunch of servers were all piled next to the kitchen area, so I'm assuming their shift had just started. 

When a server finally came to take our order, I ordered the 10 oz. Sirloin (medium well) with Mushroom Cabernet steak sauce for $26. It comes with a side of your choice. I chose a side of the Smith Bros. House Salad. We were served some fresh warm bread with whipped butter (free!) while we waited, and I loved it. 

Our food arrived all at once almost a half hour after ordering. I had the house salad first and I have NEVER been a fan of bacon, but I loved how the flavour worked with the dijon sauce. I then drizzled my sauce over my steak and started to chow down. I wasn't a fan of the sauce for the first half of my meal. I felt like it was tolerable, but I found myself enjoying the second half of my steak much better. I'd definitely say the Mushroom Cabernet is an acquired taste. I think starting off with teriyaki steak sauce is a safer bet for newbies to steakhouses. I also had a taste of my partner's matchstick fries and they were A-MAH-ZING. With OR without the prime rib sauce (she got the Prime Rib Platter). 

Service was good during our stay. Washrooms are located at the very back of the restaurant."}
{"text":"Best place for affordable steak done right!  I used to go to the Keg as my default steakhouse, but no longer. This place makes the Keg see amateur and over priced for the quality. Their menu is limited but you don't need anything else. Beer selection is on if a kind."}
{"text":"This is easily the best steakhouse in Scarborough. The portions are huge, the food is delicious, and the prices are very reasonable. After going here a couple times the keg feels like robbery. 

We started with the complementary (refillable) bread. It was fresh fluffy and warm. It basically melted in my mouth, and we are always longing for more after the first serving. 

I got the prime rib platter which was massive and cooked to perfection. The Yorkshire pudding that it comes with is also soft warm and amazing. 

This is my goto steakhouse in Scarborough."}
{"text":"Absolutely loved the atmosphere. Prices were great and food was even better! Loved the respectful waiter I had."}
{"text":"Smith Brothers is probably my favourite steakhouse in Toronto. I never thought any other place could beat my love for The Keg, but Smith Brothers, you've won me over time and time again.  With a central location, easy and free parking, excellent service (every single time I've gone there), and delicious food, Smith Brothers is my top go-to restaurant choice for special family dinners, or meeting friends for dinner.  

The ambiance is wonderful.  The tables and booths are well spaced out, so you don't feel like you are ever too close to the next table.  It is a very spacious restaurant, and I hope this never changes. It's nice to not feel like you have to squeeze between chairs to get around the restaurant.  

I normally order their \"Complete\" Prime Rib dinner for $37.  This includes a soup or house/Caesar salad, Prime Rib with au jus, Mashed potatoes and Yorkshire pudding, along with a choice of dessert.  The prime rib is melt-in-your-mouth good.  This is an excellent deal.  The serving is huge and I end up taking half of it home. I can never finish it all.  They have a variety of other \"Complete\" options starting at $29, and they include chicken, Salmon and steak options.

I've also had their Tavern Burger. It's $12, huge, and comes with shoe string fries. You can get extra toppings for $1 apiece, like smoked bacon, roasted red peppers, mushrooms, caramelized onions, emmental cheese, etc.  I've only tried the burger once, and I really enjoyed it.  Again, for me, it was so big, I could only eat half, and had the rest that night for dinner.

The kids menu was also impressive.  We ordered the Panko Panko shrimp, which was a full adult sized plate of shoestring fries and 5 good-sized panko shrimp for $8.  What a deal.   

Our colas and waters were refilled regularly, and we didn't have to ask for it.  The waiter and management came by to ensure we were happy and food was prepared to our liking.

Smith Brothers knows how to make your dining experience with them special.  From the moment you walk in, you are greeted with a warm smile, and that friendliness extends throughout your time with them.  You guys do a stellar job, Smith Brothers. Thank you for treating your customers right! You've definitely got a repeat customer in me.  Keep it up!!!"}
{"text":"What a place. I'm on a regular base around Walden and Eglinton but was not aware of Smith Bros. First impression when you enter the restaurant... some kind of a little upscaled fast food restaurant more old fashioned. But than all the good things happen. We were a party of four. Service was really outstanding. Brittany did a excellent job. You really feel that she like to work in the service and in this restaurant! She organized some potatoes wedges even they are not on the menu - it's not a big thing to do for the kitchen - but someone from our party asked for them and she made it happen. The food is also great. My colleagues had the 14oz New Yorker and I had the all you can eat PEI mussels with french shoestring fries. They have 4 local draft beers - the story about the wine is as short as the wine list (some room of improvements). Overall a very great eating experience for a very reasonable price - definitely I will visit again."}
{"text":"Atmosphere is nice and the staff are very friendly. I would recommend trying this steakhouse at least once."}
{"text":"Went here for a late night dinner with my boyfriend as I heard good reviews from friends. Our server was very friendly and honest with what the restaurant had to offer. We wanted to try the prime rib but unfortunately they ran out so we opted for the New York Striploin Complete with a Caesar Salad to start and coffee/toffee + vanilla ice-cream for dessert, as well as the Seafood Sirloin. The New York Striploin with Mushroom Cabernet steak sauce and matchstick fries were mediocre; probably wouldn't get it the next time around. The Seafood Sirloin was delicious and we would get it again. If you like a strong coffee taste, the coffee/toffee ice-cream is amazing! The prices were very reasonable and definitely worth it if you want to enjoy a delicious steak at a great price. The only downside was that there was no option for a side of veggies; they only offered mashed potatoes, baked potatoes and fries to go with their steaks. Overall, we would definitely recommend this place and will be coming here again!"}
{"text":"I love this place! One of the few places in Scarberia for a great steak and intimate dinner. Came here a couple of times with my family and bf

I got the prix fixed dinner which they called \"Completes\" - came with an app, entree and dessert which is a little overpriced considering its Scarborough but it was honestly worth every penny. Started with the corn chowder with chunks of vegetables and creamy broth it was very warming and delicious great for a winter snowy night. My entree was the sirloin steak partnered with steamed vegetables and mushroom cabernet sauce. It was cooked just the way I love my steak; medium rare and let me tell you, they know how to cook they're steaks! It was like a party in my mouth with all the distinctive flavours from the sauce. Lastly I finally made my way to dessert, the ice cream duo of coffee toffee and red spiked pralines and cream recommended by our server - it was again the best sweet ending to end the night it was the best duo of ice cream I have ever had and a little out of my comfort zone but I was so glad I took her advice!

Overall, I think this restaurant is up there with the other great steak restaurants. Ignore that they're located in Scarborough because the location cannot define the great steak, food and service this restaurant brings and there's a reason why it was awarded the \"diners choice of 2015\""}
{"text":"The New York steak is awesome! And I also like the bread. And the service also is nice."}
{"text":"Funny story, for some reason me and my girlfriend believed prime ribs to be like spare ribs for a split second. Haha not sure why however, it was quite good and is definitely tender and flavoured well. The mashed potatoes that come with the dish is extremely well made and comes in big quantities. I guess you can say that I made the right mistake.

The interior for this place looks amazing, it is dim however, you can still see your food and around the restaurant. The kitchen is visible from the dining room and you can see the chiefs cook. The staff is extremely friendly and caring. The chiefs are also extremely friendly. 

The food, as I have said before, is awesome. The prime rib is tender, the pot pie is amazing however, can be a little salty. I would advise to get the mashed potatoes with the pot pie and not sub it for something else. The bread although it may sound weird, is probably one of the best things there. It is extremely soft in the middle and crispy on the outside, almost as if it was just baked. When eaten with the butter, it creates an exceptionally good combination."}
{"text":"Casual environment, great service. Enjoy the mussels (appetizer size is pretty big already)"}
{"text":"I'm glad I decided to give this place a try. The ambiance of this restaurant is great, and it was a lot bigger than I expected. Brick walls, vintage art work, exposed ceilings - nicely decorated. The food was great, although not much variety on the menu (can't expect anything different for a steakhouse though). Me and my boyfriend came in on a Saturday night so it was quite busy, but what's good is that they have a lounge available for people who want to eat appetizers or have drinks while waiting. We waited only about 15-20 minutes then got brought to our table inside. It was cozy, and the service was friendly. I feel bad I forgot our servers name, but he was extremely nice and attentive! He checked up on us often, and made sure everything was perfect. He recommended my boyfriend the peppercorn sauce and it was absolutely delicious. To top it all off he offered us a complimentary dessert, which was a pleasant surprise :) will be going back!"}
{"text":"Great customer service. One of the best steak house uptown and the price is very reasonable."}
{"text":"wow you definitely wanna come here if you want delicious, high quality steaks/ribs, great service, and an amazing deal.

from the delicious starter bread, to the daily pint deals everything about this place just screams a great meal without breaking the bank :D love this place."}
{"text":"I've never been here for dinner before so this was a new experience for me, let me tell you it did not disappoint or brake my pocket book either! 

This was my final stop on my birthday weekend with some dear friends I've not caught up with in some time & the atmosphere allowed us to do just that! It was warm & inviting. The service was phenomenal. 

You want prime rib? Well this is the place to go! It was so tender. I will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"Amazing place. Great environment. Excellent staff. The food is awesome. Celebratined my nephews birthday. We all had a great time."}
{"text":"Solid steakhouse. Like the Keg, but not quite as good. Try the beer sampler if your into beer. To eat... The prime rib is great. We have been a few times and the service is always excellent."}
{"text":"Went to Smith Bros. yesterday for a friend's birthday dinner and I would definitely return.

Service - efficient and friendly.  We were checked up on, on several occasions and our water was refilled without having to ask. Also, they did not hurry us out at 9:30 when the restaurant closed. We didn't realize that the restaurant closed that early.  

Food- bread and butter was warm and toasty.  We had seconds! I ordered the 7 oz sirloin with crumbled bacon and bourbon sauce and baked potato.  It was delicious - tender and juicy. All of my dinner companions were very complimentary about their steak meals. We got the triple chocolate nut brownie to share for dessert, but it was average. 

Overall, it was a great dining experience."}
{"text":"Dinner with a couple of girlfriends. Went during thirsty Thursdays where they give you samples of beer -- pretty cool. We each ordered steak, I ordered the prime steak for $29. After our order was taken, they gave us a basket of bread to keep company. The wait time was ridiculous, we waited 40 minutes for our food so then I asked the waitress if our food was coming and she replied it should be coming soon... Another 10 minutes and finally our food arrives. Pretty ridiculous right?

The manager came to our table (without our prompt) and apologized for the long wait. He explained the chef was training another and got the orders mixed -- told us our food should have came  20 min earlier, and it was a huge mistake... Etc etc told us that dessert would be complimentary which was nice of him (but with the speech he gave us, we were under the impression our entire dinner would be taken care of). Still, it was nice enough that he came by to apologize.

At least our food was delicious. Steak was juicy and perfect. Sides were good, the weird bread/scone thing was bland though. 

Dessert - we ordered the brownie cake, mixed berry cheesecake and vanilla creme brulee $7 each but complimentary. The brownie cake tastes bitter -- I think they used dark chocolate, so not a big fan. We barely touched it. The cheesecake was not bad, tastes like cream cheese and not as heavy. The creme brulee was very bland, didn't have much taste to it at all. I definitely wouldn't order dessert from there again -- good thing it was free.

The steaks however, I'd come back for. But hopefully without the long wait.

Nice restaurant, definitely bigger than I imagined. Kind of like the keg but not as expensive."}
{"text":"I'd never heard of this place before, but now I'm glad I have! I came here for dinner with my family. This place used to be a Tucker's Marketplace but you couldn't tell. :) It had a very modern but cozy atmosphere, with some interesting and unique decor.

Service was prompt and very professional, 4/5 of us ordered the sirloin and it was delicious! I had my steak cooked medium rare and it was cooked beautifully. 7oz for $21, so pretty Keg-like pricing. I had the creamy garlic mashed potatoes and they give you a ton. There is also a choice of 4 gravies to choose from. One person in my party got the burger with the skinny little fries and both were so good...I kept sneaking the fries off her plate but it didn't even matter because they give you SO MUCH. 

In short: great replacement for if you've burned yourself out on The Keg and can't afford Ruth's Chris (lol). I forgot to mention the fresh baked bread they bring you while you wait...mmmmm"}
{"text":"This place is awesome. I have been there a number of times  .and the 14 ounce Robert is the best if u want the best go there .never mind the keg. Beats it 100 percent. Will be back again and again"}
{"text":"Great steakhouse with wonderful menu options. Nice to have this gem in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Wow, this place is a hidden gem! Come during Appy Hour (3-6pm) from Monday to Friday. The regular price for these apps is usually around $10, but during Appy Hour you get them for just $5 per dish. The sizes of the apps don't change, so you're still getting an enormous portion. I'm definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"Came with the fam. 

Started with the beer sampler. Wow,  the premium red  beer was actually really good and rarely say that about beer to be honest. 

Also rare for me to compliment a steak house but I would definitely recommend here. Decent steaks, great ambiance  and atmosphere with open kitchen and not overwhelming beef aroma. However I did notice some servers could smile more but they gradually brightened up as the night went on. 

Had the prime rib and it was decent. Usually that is the best to any steak house but the rib eye was amazing. Maybe just got lucky on that cut but most of it melted in your mouth. Decent portions and good pricing. We also had the guacamole as a starter. Some enjoyed it but I thought it sub par compared to others I've had. Like what all others are saying get the shoe string Fries. 

I'll up this to a 5 star if I go next time and get the same great experience.  (hopefully some more smiles from the waitress tho :)"}
{"text":"I love coming here, this place is amazing. The atmosphere is incredible and so is the food. The customer service is excellent as well. I came here for my bf and I's birthday and our anniversary as well. It tends to get busy though, so make sure you make reservation.
I can't wait to come here again!"}
{"text":"Stellar experience! Food was incredible, but what really put it over the top was the awesome service. Our server was attentive and offered very helpful recommendations. Great atmosphere and sizeable portions. My new favourite steakhouse."}
{"text":"Attended Smith Bros last night for my first time with my girlfriend and I will DEFINITELY be back!!!

We had reservations for 7pm on a Saturday night which I highly recommend doing as it was a 45 min wait without one. 

We were greeted and seated promptly upon arriving. Our server attended our table within 3-5 mins of sitting down and took our drink orders. 

We then placed our app and main course order. 

- Steak and Fire Grilled Shrimp 
- Steak and Seafood 
- Mussels

The server brought out fresh hot bread immediately after with the mussels. He then made it a personal experience by telling us how great of a deal the mussels are and how at $19 for all you can eat is one of there best value items. 

Our dinners arrived. Steaks were cooked PERFECT. I had the shoestring fries which were a little difficult to eat but tasty. Mashed potato was tasty as well!

All in all Id come back in a heartbeat."}
{"text":"Best prime rib in TO !!!!
I was there twice for gathering.   We were there late (8pm) but still pack.  We make the reservation ( recommended ) but still have a bit of wait!
We start with a couple appetizer and drinks! For drinks I would recommend the beer tasting with 5 little beer of your choice and the Mango splash is one if the best !!! For appetizer we ordered the mussel, coconut shrimp and the guacamole.  I love and first two but not the Guacamole with chips.   The mussel is excellent!! it was fresh with great white wine broth.  The coconut shrimp was just perfect with combination of sweet and savory.  |Guacamole is the only one I did not like.  It was freshlly made in front of you but the taste was just okay... It was missing a bit of salt, lime juice and garlic.   overall it was a bit flat in taste.  
Woo Hoo ... here comes the main course!!! BEST PRIME RIBS in town!!!
It was melt in your mouth!! We choose mash potato... It was so yummy!  the mash is creamy and buttery.  Among the sides, I would not recommend the match stick fried.  The idea was great but it soak up some oil some it comes a bit oily."}
{"text":"The food was very tasty and the service was great. I love the open kitchen look .I got the seafood sirloin and I love how they gave chunks of lobster . the strawberry cheesecake at the end was also very delicious."}
{"text":"I've been to Smith Bros steakhouse a couple times. Their steak is decent and price is reasonable. We ordered Filet Mignon ($33), Rib-Eye Steak ($35), Seafood Sirloin ($32) and New York Strips ($30). Out of the 4, I personally like Filet Mignon the most, because it is very tender; but my parents like the Rib-Eye better. I wish seafood sauce can be one of the option. Overall, good experience and worth your money."}
{"text":"Came to smith brothers last Friday for date night with the husband. Arrived around 8pm didn't have reservation. 
They had three Christmas party going on so we had to wait, but they have a nice lounge area you can sit, wait and order drinks. 
20 mins later seated. 

Got appetizer fresh made guacamole 
It was really good, waitress was nice shared all the ingredients said they don't put citrus, but if we liked they can add lime. We said yes and she got it right away 
Fresh guacamole $9

Husband ordered sirloin medium with fries 
It came med rare, they fixed it right away and gave him extra fries $25 10 oz

I got filet mignon with bacon, cooked med. with mash. 
It comes with mushroom and balsamic glaze, I asked for it on the side. 
It was perfectly cooked still
Juicy on inside and reasonably priced  $35 7 oz 

I would come back! great price and service."}
{"text":"My second time here and the food/service was just as good! Love the atmosphere here and the staff are all wonderful. During our first visit I had the sirloin completes meal with Caesar salad, fries as my side and the chocolate orange mousse. I chose the mushroom sauce for my steak but didn't like it. Everything else was perfect. The boy had the prime rib platter and he ate every last bite. 

This time around we went with a larger group. I had the chicken Marsala with mashed potatoes, very tasty. The sauce makes it. Two people ordered steaks and the other two had burgers (burgers were huge!). Everyone enjoyed their meals and said they would come back. I love that they give you warm bread to start. And their pina coladas are the best I've ever had! I had the creme brûlée and it too was one of the best! The size is double what you'd get anywhere else and so delicious! Cold, smooth creamy custard with a warm crunchy sugar crust. Mmm!"}
{"text":"Great place.  Convenient.  The steaks are delicious.  I would give it a higher rating but I know of one other place that makes steak even better but I have to save the 5 star for them.  Nevertheless, Smith Bros is highly recommended.  

Tips:  some dishes come with the really thin fries.  These are not my thing but they are okay.  I prefer mashed potatoes but my friends raved over the fries.  The sauces are really good and you have a choice.  Try a bit of your steak without the sauce too because I found it to be really good and used the sauce for my potatoes. 

The atmosphere is very good.  It is big so sometimes it is a bit loud.  That did not impact our visit though.  Great food and service.  I will return!"}
{"text":"Happy Hour! Monday-Friday 3 pm - 6 pm!

A choice of $5 app for sharing and goes well with their beer. $5-$6 for a pint of beer?!

We shared:

Shanghai Chicken Dumpling ($5)
Jalapeno Chili and Chips ($5)
Steak Tacos Al Carbon ($5)

I know those might not prepared from scratch, locally sourced but at that price? I thought I am eating at my usual Hong Kong Style Cafe afternoon tea special menu!

Love the relaxing vibe at the bar area.

I will be back! And I know Sami will be back too!"}
{"text":"I'd have to rate Smith Bros somewhere between 3 and 4. The food was good: tender steak grilled to our asking and pretty good mashed potatoes. The price was pretty much what you would pay at the Keg. I thought the service was solid: attentive and friendly. The manager asked how everything was and we were pretty satisfied. I will likely return.. it's close by home. The only thing is... I prefer my steaks cooked on cast iron, the ones here are grilled so there isn't much of a crust on the steak. Not bad though."}
{"text":"Great service! The all u can eat mussel is the best, good size mussel and taste sooo good. The only thing is they don't offer bone in steak."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner, and it was amazing!! So happy I decided to try this place out. The service was really good. Our waiter was so kind and attentive. He gave us really good suggestions as well. The environment of the restaurant wasn't amazing but it was still good. It's a good place to come for a date, special event, or for a family lunch/dinner.

The food was AMAZING! We got the shanghai chicken dumplings for an appetizer, the New York strip steak with peppercorn cream sauce & cream mashed potatoes for the main dish, and vanilla creme brûlée for dessert. All three dishes tasted so good. 

I would def. come back! :)
P.S. they also give you complimentary bread with butter."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, great food. Smith Bros is a great place for a date or even a family event. The service is really nice and the bread is amazing :) 

Try the Seafood Sirloin !"}
{"text":"Decided to check this place out and I didn't even know this existed in Scarborough! I definitely like the Match stock fries they are so addictive and they give you fresh bread which was so good.  Good place for good food."}
{"text":"Decent place serving decent food. 

The prime rib dip was good: BEEF, soft bread, tasty au jus. But I needed more horseradish.

And I have to admit, their famous matchstick fries were sortof a let down. Most of them were soggy, akin to eating potato noodles. Or are matchstick fries not supposed to be similar in texture to Hickory Sticks? 

But the decor was nice and the staff were professional.

This place is appropriate for office functions, dates and occasions where you feel like going to The Keg but for whatever reason don't want to actually \"go\" to The Keg."}
{"text":"Really surprised of their excellent service and good quality of food. This restaurent have various sauce for steak. I picked the mushroom sauce for filet mignon (medium rare). literally i dont like taste of sauce. Manager came to my table and he offer another sauce that is bacon sauce free to try?i love it. Filet mignon cooked perfectly.  This place is really beat the keg and one of must go restaurent in my list."}
{"text":"Really great tasting food. Their prime rib dip is so delicious. They have very best desserts as well."}
{"text":"If you are looking for an awesome steak meal and hip atmosphere then this is the place.  

West Scarborough has few great restaurants and this place is always busy for that reason.  They offer great food, selection of beers and service to please most.  The house salad and steak is my go to meal here and I am never disappointed.  I would recommend a dinner reservation on the weekends since this is a popular place and the wait can be 30 mins+ if you just walk in.  They have banquet rooms that can accommodate the largest party.

I highly recommend this restaurant.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"The hostess is the first person you see when you walk into a restaurant. She could at least try to pretend she likes her job, she looked miserable and unfriendly honestly. 

My server was really friendly, knew the menu very well, made conversation about the food-- really personable. I'd definitely hope to have him again the next time I dine there. Their food is GREAT! Started with chips & guac, their guac is made right at your table in front of you. So it was nice and fresh. Their ribs are finger licking good, definitely get them again. Their mussels are good could be better but good (they're AYCE). Drink menu is a good size! Good cocktails and nice selection or beer. Overall, Great food & great service!"}
{"text":"My favorite steak place in Scarborough. The prime rib platter is my go to every time I go there. Perfectly medium rare.  Would go back again and again for it!
Such a family friendly environment, very large space but very cozy atmosphere. Unlike downtown, plenty of parking right outside."}
{"text":"Smith Bros is a casual family steakhouse with multiple rooms inside. Some rooms are well lit while other rooms are darker for a more romantic vibe. They brew their own craft beers which is great. The steak options are reasonably priced and comes with a great selection of slides. The best value item to share is the unlimited claims and hickory stick fries."}
{"text":"Great burger and butter squash soup. Haven't have time to try other stuff. Service is excellent. The waiter is able to accommodate my rushed schedule. 

So far so good."}
{"text":"At a steakhouse but looking for a main dish that's not steaks and ribs? That's me.  

Flipping through the menu, the \"all you can eat mussels and fries - $25\" quickly caught my attention.  How does it work and how is it served?  With a level of curiosity,I placed my AYCE mussel order with a flight of beer. 

The PEI mussels are steamed with Smith Bros premium lager and dressed with shallots and parsley.  Your first order is served with matchstick fries.  Mussels came generously portioned.  Broth at the bottom is rich and flavourful.  The beer taste in broth is noticeable.  Once finished, you can always ask for more mussels without reordering the fries.  I would say two rounds of mussels are optimal while third round becomes too much and numb your senses.  

Service was attentive with regular checkups by our waitress.  Overall, is the AYCE mussel with it ? Sure, if you can consume two rounds of mussels or more.  I would definitely recommend this place and come back again."}
{"text":"Service was great but I'd still say food at leg is much better and same price.  I had the seafood sirloin very bland had to add salt.  Probably won't go back"}
{"text":"Went there on Tuesday night around seven o clock 

Restaurant was quiet 

I had some suppliers in from Montreal and decided to treat them at Smiths 
I have never been so embarrassed at a restaurant before 

The food was beyond terrible 

I ordered the 10 oz sirloin with pepper sauce. Medium rare.   Steak arrived well done and cold.  Pepper sauce had no pepper flavour and was so runny 

By clients ordered 7 oz sirloin with shrimps medium well done and pepper sauce 
Steak looked like two pieces of leftover burnt steak that had been sitting there and was basically in edible. Sauce was bad 

They were showing pumpkin ale bottles but never had any 
I ordered the only cider they had.  It was brought to me in a small tumbler and tasted very flat 

I think that if the specialize in a product ( steak) it should be spectacular not below standard 
We decided not to try the desserts based on the inferior meal we just had 

One thing surprised me is how they stay in business ? Do the customers have such low expectations ??"}
{"text":"Came here with the whole family crew.... 4 adults and 2 kids (aged 4 and 6).  
The place is very large, with a nice open kitchen so you can see what is going on.   I like the decor.... although I wouldn't know how to describe it.  
There is very little division as far as the tables and dividers go, so while it didn't bother us, we did notice that it got very loud inside the restaurant.  This is a good steak place to bring kids (vs. the Keg or something like that).  They have kids menus that they can colour on and provide crayons.  Winning!  
The Mussel appetizer for $10 was MASSIVE... looked like a main course.  Good mussels.  Note.. they have an AYCE Mussel main course option for $18.  The firecracker shrimp apps were also delicious.  
They have some delicious beers... some of their own... very micro brewery/craft style.  
I had the 14 oz new york strip for 28.  It was good. Had a peppercorn cream sauce which was okay as well.  I ate well this night.  
The service was actually fantastic at this restaurant.  I have zero complaints... this restaurant is recommended. It cost us a good amount, but I guess that can be expected from any quality steak house.  
I would label this as a family steak house... and would bring my family here.  If I was looking for somewhere to bring a date... I would head back to the Keg.  While the Keg is dark and romantic, Smith Bros is bright and loud.  :)"}
{"text":"Decided to pop in here on a Saturday evening for dinner. As soon as you enter your kindly greeted by two welcoming hostesses. The restaurant is very spacious and dim lit. We were seated in a comfy booth across from the open kitchen. I love watching the chefs busy at work grilling up steaks and plating dishes!

Our waiter came over to describe the menus and take our orders. She was soo helpful in explaining everything and making recommendations. Steaks come with your choice of sauce but I couldn't decide on one so she offered to bring me two to try!

After taking our orders she brought out a basket of warm soft and fluffy bread (sort of like the Keg's bread) with some whipped butter. It was soo good we polished off the basket within minutes. Our lovely waiter took note of this and kindly brought us some more.

For my entree I of course had to order the steak

7oz Sirloin steak with garlic and cream mashed potatoes 
Cooked perfectly medium rare with a nice seared exterior. A tender steak but not the best I've ever had but still pretty good for the Scarborough area! The garlic and cream mashed potatoes were heavenly though. Super creamy with a mild garlic flavour and a huge portion piled on the plate.

I like that the sauces accompanying the steaks were served on the side in little gravy boats. 
I choose the Mushroom Cabernet which had juicy slices of mushrooms which absorbed the Cabernet sauce and sauteed onions. Definitely a present taste of alcohol in this sauce but still pleasant
The other sauce I chose was the Peppercorn Cream sauce which I enjoyed slightly more because it was creamier and had a little kick from whole peppercorns inside.

After clearing our plates our waitress offered to bring over the dessert menu. After seeing that they serve Greg's ice cream which is a local ice cream maker and produces all natural small-batch flavours I couldn't resist!

I ordered a double scoop dish with Roasted marshmallow and Coffee Toffee (two of Greg's most popular flavours)
Roasted marshmallow - tasted exactly like a burnt marshmallow straight from the fire pit. Very strong tasting and maybe too overwhelming for me
Coffee Toffee - definitely for a coffee lover, again strong coffee flavours with crunchy bits of toffee mixed through out.

Overall I'd say Smith Bros. is definitely a welcome addition to line up of Scarborough steakhouses. Service here was over the top good! Our waitress was very good on checking on us before and after everything was served and food came out in good timing as well."}
