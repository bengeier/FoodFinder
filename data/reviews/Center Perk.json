{"text":"Tonight we went to Center Perk in Chardon, OH for gelato.  There were about 9 flavors of gelato (but no chocolate!), and also sorbet and ice cream (they do have chocolate ice cream).  The staff was very friendly and happy to help.  I got a large cup with three scoops:  hazelnut, cinnamon, and pistachio.  The hazelnut and cinnamon were very good, but I wasn't a fan of their pistachio flavor.  All the gelato had a good smooth, creamy consistency.  I'd definitely go back for some more!"}
