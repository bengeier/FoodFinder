We've been to Crave ever since it's opened. I've tried a handful of dishes there and for the most part, I've enjoyed my meals. I've also had pretty good service here as well. 

First time we came here, we were with a larger group, they had just opened a couple of weeks before and the manager came out to get our opinion. Nice guy who genuinely wanted to get our feedback. 

My previous visit, my husband ordered the lamb chops. They were all bone and my husband was really disappointed - it's not a cheap meal after all! So he bought it up to the waitress and she offered him a new meal.

Most recently, I had the New York strip and my husband had the filet minion. My steak was over done and was tough to eat. Gravy for my potatoes did not taste proper either. My husband shared half his portion with me - his meal was cooked perfectly.  My friends who ordered steaks and pastas were pleased with their meals, so I was the odd one out. 

Dessert was good - had the molten chocolate cake with ice cream - delish! 

The waitress was nice - very cheery, quick with our requests."}
{"text":"Our company held a party of over 90 people over the holidays. We were very pleased with Crave Grill House. They offered a good selection of foods at a reasonable price and they were very well done. 
The staff were very professional and accommodating. The manager was great to work with, he made the party planning much easier."}
{"text":"Went for a Sunday lunch of about 20/30 people. Service was terrible. Spinach and artichoke dip was delicious. Steak was pretty good for a restaurant steak but not as good as an actual steakhouse steak. The Buffalo chicken sandwich had great flavour but was way too overcooked and dry. I did say something to the waitress but she didnt really awknowledge my concern.  Personally didn't try anything else but based on some of the people around me they did not like their pastas. Piri Piri chicken was good and the portion was huge. Overall the place was ok. I think my experience and recommendation would be much different if we had better service."}
{"text":"We've come here a few times and we really love it.  Most of their appetiters are really good. We have tasted almost all their plates and love them. Their pasta are okay not great. All their chicken and beef plates are really good. Only thing we dont like is their kids menu, which isn't really tasty and are kids never eat them, they like our food better. 
Always had a really nice server."}
{"text":"This place is very nice and clean, I tried the beef short ribs and I have to say they were amazing, from the first bite to the last, I highly recommend this place, prices are decent and quantity is good enough but the quality is what makes it worth it"}
{"text":"I would give it a zero if i can. The steak my friend order was 90% fat. The peri peri sauce i ordwr with my wife was super salty like they put thw whole shaker in there. Another friend order the pasta steak was filled with oil. Not like a little to much but alot of oil. The sirloin steak my other buddy order was like a gum it stretched like crazy!! And my brothers pasta was was chicken which he couldnt eat the chicken because it was rubbery like was cook 2 days old. The vanilla shake milk with icecream. Then i ordered the hot sauce they gave a tabasco sauce which was watered down!! I never would recommend this restaurant to my enemy!! Worst place to eat i been to bad restaurant by far this is the worst in the world!"}
{"text":"I was hesitant to go in, considering Mr Greeks is beside Crave. To my pleasant surprise the items on the menu are all reasonably priced and you won't pay $75 for 2 people to eat at this place, as they have dinner specials for 2-4 guest.  
The service was fast, the waitress was well informed about the menu items and had eaten here herself.  Food came to the table hot and presented nicely. 
Loved the drinks in mason jars for cups, nice touch. Their fountain pop was mixed correctly and tasted like it was straight from the can. I love fountain pop, like more then life. (So I know good fountain pop when I taste it) 
We had the chicken parm with pasta and 4 cheese stuffed chicken with mash and salad. Gotta say it was great and for $38 for 2 it was so worth it.  
I highly recommend this place to everyone as they serve halal as well  
Deffinetly a diamond in the middle of da hood!"}
{"text":"I have been to this place twice now, the location is a little random but the food is really Excellent! The plating is good, and the taste is delicious. If you are going to go here, definitely order steak, that's what you are here for mostly, you can get the other stuff elsewhere too maybe. And the steaks are exceptional. From their menu I have tried the Filet Mignon, as well as the NY Striploin and bites of the short ribs and lamb chops. The chimichurri is yummy, the potato side and rice are both good as well. The molten lava cake is really good super moist, gooey chocolate base as well served with whipped cream, vanilla ice cream and topped with a cherry sauce. So I just want to commend the owner for opening such an establishment and for the really amazing food! I will keep going back here and taking more people just for the food. 

They were really busy the night we went and took about an hour to serve our steaks so be prepared for a super long wait time. Our lamb chops were overdone to the point they were burnt, but the owner saw this and sent out another plate which was a nice touch. 

I took away a star only because of the service. They usually have 3 servers, one of them is really good, haven't really been served by one and the 3rd I may have a slight issue with. I took my dad there for his birthday and right away after she took our order I went to talk to her and ask her if I could order the lava cake at the end of our meal and told her it was my dads birthday and if they did anything special and she said they can add a candle. For whatever reason our server had switched during our meal (which is totally fine with me) but after we finished our main course, we were asked to see the dessert menus, at which point I mentioned I already spoke to one of the servers about dessert (so as not to ruin the surprise). Firstly, that was slightly off-putting as the whole point of telling the original lady who took our order was so this didn't happen. After waiting for a long while, I finally got up again to tell our original server about my request, and she said they would send it out in a minute. Except they did send it out, but without a candle! I was really upset at that point since we had already waited so long for it, and I had specifically requested for it twice at that point! For goodness sakes write it down if you can't remember but its something so simple, small and courteous. A few minutes later another server came with a cake and a candle and was surprised to see the first one without the candle. She told us it was on the house which was really nice of her, but at that point the surprise was ruined and we didn't really want another dessert.  

Anyway little rant at the end, but the food is really, really good, the owner seems really nice , the ambiance is good as well, so definitely try this place out!"}
{"text":"Holy moly this is def my favourite restaurant in all of Toronto. Food is superb, absolutely fantastic and although expensive, worth every penny. If you haven't tried this you definitely are missing out."}
{"text":"Amazing place to eat with family. Service was quick and polite. The server answered all our questions and checked on us every couple min. Very hard to find a halal steak house with good food and service. I drive 1hr to come to this place to eat. I got a my steak, was well cooked and very juicy. 

Opportunities: the menu to busy, they should pick their best and keep it simple."}
{"text":"The restaurant is certainly worth a try, but they also have a few issues they need to work on.  If they address those, then I think this is potentially a better option than Affy's.

The Good:

-Great burger, great fries, great pasta, chicken parm, and ribs, great chimachurri suace and good service 

The Bad:

-The steaks are not good quality cuts of beef.  This applies to the striploin and the ribeye.  The price is fair for a good cut of beef, not a poor quality cut of beef.  Too thin and butchered poorly.  The result is when I asked for a medium-rare I got a medium-well steak.  They may not even know the difference.  If you can't source good cuts of steak, don't serve steaks.  Drowning it with sauce is not a good tactic. 

-The chicken on the nachos was microwaved and not fresh.  The nachos were small in portion and not very good.  Nobody, puts lettuce on nachos and the lack of cheese indicates a frugal approach to food."}
{"text":"The food was good, but the service was so bad that in the end it didn't really matter. 
Most places they come up and ask you how is everything, not here. Our table felt completely ignored, not going back there again!"}
{"text":"Worst halal steak restaurant around!!!!! The service is terrible and the chef doesn't understand how to cook steak. I can't even describe how disappointed we were, mostly with their service as the issue was completely fixable."}
{"text":"My brother took me to this place on my birthday. My first take was a great nice big restaurant!

The place is huge and has lot of seating and would be ideal for families and big groups. The serve on the other hand was a bit slow, I am not sure if they were short on staff that night. Our server was very friendly and brought the food as soon as it was ready as the food was hot.

We ordered multiple things starting with an appetizer Beef Short Rib Potato Skins which were excellent and very tasty. For the meal we ordered a burger, Piri piri chicken with rice and fries and Blackened chicken & shrimp. I had Piri piri chicken which was a bit dry and burnt for my licking but their fries were good. 

We closed the night with Molten lava cake which was quiet good.

Overall great restaurant with slow service when I was there and it was not busy. Food is average!

For my Muslim folks - they serve halal meat."}
{"text":"Very bad customer service.  The food was too spicy that we couldn't eat it. Kids meal plain pasta taste really bad and costs 9 dollars. Will never be back here ever. Steak wasn't good either."}
{"text":"Love this place especially since it's halal.  Their steaks are perfectly cooked with the best chimichurri sauce and their big potatoes are very delicious. I've also tried the peppercorn burger and it was very moist and delicious not heavy at all. The Caesar salad is average.  Would go back 8/10"}
{"text":"This review only applies to the Iftaar Buffet, I've been 3 years in a row and every year they have gotten more organized. Selection is great if you crave western halal food, there is no ethnic food here, if you want that go to Tandoori Time which is nearby and has the same owners. 
With the buffet you have to be a little bit pushy and line up before its even time to break fast, hold a date in your hand. Once you grab your food by the time you are done the first plate the line will still be there you just have to have some patience. Food wise everything was replenished quickly, steak was tender and juciy, everything had a lot of sauce, dessert could be improved. Although the price is high for buffet its probably the best halal buffet you'll get that only comes once a year. I've been for their regular menu and its hit and miss."}
{"text":"Came here after work with my friend. Food was good but service was horrible. Waiting very long for appetizer and the main course. Than waiting again for the waitress to get off her phone to check on us and to ask for the bill. When she did decide to  check on the customer she ignore our table until we had to call out for her. When she bought dessert to the table she dropped the spoon. She did give me a new spoon but she left the dirty spoon with ice cream on it on the table infront of us.  Good food, Horrible service and waitress. P.S. she only had 3 tables to serve."}
{"text":"My family and I have eaten here several times over the last year. I love the steaks here, especially with the sauce that comes with shrimp and appetizers are all really good. I love steak and they do it really well. 

As others have mentioned the staff are slow at times, probably my only complaint. 

It's probably a bad idea to go during Iftar. It's too bad they're not doing it well, definitely a missed opportunity for them. If you were unhappy during the Iftar service I would say give them another chance after Ramadan."}
{"text":"A fantastic place that gets 5 stars solely on its food and staff - the location would deduct half a star.

Experience:
We were a party of 11 going for dinner; the staff was very accommodating and our order arrived without errors or omissions.  We, like many families, are rather chatty around the table; it was strangely eerie how silent we were as each of our meals arrived - and this is just a testament of how delicious the food was.

Food:
I ordered a medium done New York Strip Loin that was perfectly executed, my wife ordered a Filet Mignon and she's still talking about it ever since.  

All around, everyone loved their meals and we will gladly revisit this location."}
{"text":"Surprised my wife and daughter to a beautiful dinner (piri piri chicken, Farafelle alfredo, artichoke and spinach dip with pita and tortilla chips. And for dessert: molten lava cake.  This is our second visit.  Previously my wife had the steak.  Served in a timely manner, the waitress are helpful in deciding on a dish.  The food presented and tasted like from a high end restaurant.  We like the food so much that we recommended the restaurant to all our friends and family.  Today the chef served the Farafelle Alfredo with noodle instead of butterfly pasta.  Although I ate some but still mentioned to the waitress that I was expecting the dish with butterfly pasta.  She said no worries that I should continue eating the one I had if I want to do so, and she then had the chef prepare another batch with butterfly pasta at no extra charge (which I took home)."}
{"text":"Halal meat is served here per signs on the restaurant. Went here for dinner with party of 4.  Restaurant was not that busy as it was a Monday night.  We had the 3 course dinner for 4 people for $65.  Did not include steak as one of the meal options but can \"steak it up\" for only $5 more which is what I Did.  Had the NY Sirloin Steak (Medium Well) with Mushroom Sauce and Mash on the side.  Was very good.  We also had the Peri Peri chicken which was also good.  For Apps had the Artichoke Dip which was great.  Tried the calamari, which was OK (needed to be fried up a little bit more as it was too chewy).  For dessert had the NY Cheesecake and the Molten Lava Cake.  Both were good.  Also had Pina Colada for drink (very good).  Overall it was a great experience with very good food.  One person in our party complained that the waiter did not come and refill our waters.  But not a big deal in my opinion.  Will come here again next time I am in Toronto."}
{"text":"went for a Iftar buffet on first Saturday. had to wait 25 minutes after iftar to get the food. there were only one serving station. after we got the food and went back the line again was 15 minutes long. 

for service, they were having hard time keeping the serving dishes full. at one point they ran out of dishes and kept folks waiting for 10 minutes and then finally brought wet plates. table were also not getting cleaned as there were not enough wait staff on hand.

food was also not great, only they chicken with mushroom sauce was any good. peri peri chicken was dry, beef was tough and chewy. people had to keep on reminding them of food was running out.

i ended up spending $200 as we had invited another family for iftar, and did not feel like i got my money's worth, would have been better getting stuck to the a la carte then buffet."}
{"text":"One of the few halal places where you can enjoy sitting in a good atmosphere and have good food. Their steaks are very good would recommend anyone. Deserts are also amazing. Definitely would recommended this place. Staff was very courteous and friendly."}
{"text":"I dont recommend coming here. Tried once and never again! Whoever is promoting this place doesnt know a thing. Waiters and staff are extremely unprofessional with terrible customer service."}
{"text":"This place is not a good, but definitely not bad it's just average. I had the potato skins, they were nothing special. Also, I ordered the steak with pepercorn sauce. The steak was cooked medium just like I ordered, but the pepercon sauce wasn't a great choice. Lastly, the molten chocolate lava cake sounded too good not to order; however, I am sure it was not made to order, in fact I think it was one of those cheap lava cakes that are sold in grocery stores."}
{"text":"Their steaks are ok. The peri peri chicken was good. Had flavour and was moist. The side ceasar salad was better than the steak. The chicken parmesan was decent too. I was surprised to see the servers were making the shakes/drinks. So we got our drinks after we were done with our meal. Service is good. But slow. Cause there are limited staff. Would I go again? Hmm...not sure"}
{"text":"Can't believe that I literally threw away my money on sub par food.  The burger was dryer than sandpaper. My wife ordered the 7 ounce steak, again another dry matter. A steak is supposed to be juicy and melt in ur mouth. This was neither, rather a slab of meat made by a disgruntled chef.  The mushroom sauce seemed like it was made from a chillis club house sauce packet, i.e. not made fresh. 
Even the mashed potato was a failure, they served it without any gravy. Also each dish has 5 pieces of veggies as sides, very disappointing to the lowest level. I mean they did use frozen veggies, so cost should not be a factor.

Overall for the price we paid, we expected something ten times better. I feel ripped off and will suggest everyone to avoid at all costs."}
{"text":"Great Steak, Great Service !!

We went there as a group of 4 +Children. Did the reservations before hand. We were greeted cordially and directed to our table, we asked for a change as it was close to the door, and she assisted us accordingly, no qualms about it. The ambience is good with good enough seating.

We ordered 2 Well done steaks, one 8oz and other 12oz, Blackened Chicken Shrimp, Peri Peri Chicken, Pasta for the Children. 

The Pasta came about quick, just that it was dry and the Children hardly had it. Now was the main wait. The server mentioned a juice comes along with the meal making the kid a little happy. 

It must've taken close to 30-35 Mins for other dishes to come, good that we had company as the time passed by, so I had ordered the 8oz for myself and my friend ordered 12oz, they mixed up the order. The waitress gave me the 12oz and realized shortly it was meant for the friend. Since I had already taken a bite, she totally acknowledged it and went again to get another 12oz for my friend. Now while we were eating my friend was waiting for another 15mins for his steak to come. 

The Steak thought was well done, very well cooked, the Peri Peri Chicken portion was big as well, the Shrimps also tasted great with chunks of marinated chicken. They have multiple sauces to choose from, I chose the Feni Deni for mine, it's spicy !

So after 15mins, my friends Steak came and with the first bite itself he said it is totally burnt, we had it and it was not at all same as mine, we call the waitress and again she was polite enough to acknowledge it and went in again to get a new one for another 20 mins, this time the Manager came in return with the steak and apologized for the same. The Steak was great and delicious!

As we were wrapping up, the server comes again and says there is also one ice cream included with the kids meal. There were 2kids and obviously they wanted different flavors..lol, she smiled and got them their flavors without charging for additional one. 

So irrespective of the wait and the confusions, they delivered exceptional service and their food was totally worth the wait as well. Surely returning here and recommend it !!"}
{"text":"We had a burger and what is one of their more popular items-rib flatbread. Neither of our meals were good. We stopped in hoping for a good meal and left not feeling great after forcing bad food down from being so hungry.

Skip this place."}
{"text":"Food was pretty good. I had the four cheese chicken and the peri peri chicken. Both were fantastic but I liked the peri peri better. The restaurant is big so good for a large group. I went here for a birthday dinner with about 20 people and we never felt overcrowded."}
{"text":"Crave is as good as it gets! We have come here a number of times over the past few years, bringing friends and family, and for special/celebratory occasions, and we simply love it. 

The service is always fast, and polite. And what's most important: we come for the halal steak, and halal steak Crave does very well indeed! A big problem in halal restaurants is the tendency to overcook the steak (you get  a medium when you ask for a medium rare), and that never happens here.  

I firmly believe that if Crave was in Scarborough or Markham or Mississauga, it would be considered the best halal steakhouse in the GTA -- heads above Affy's, Kara Mia, Pepper Walk and their ilk."}
{"text":"I had chicken parmesan and it was unflavorful. The spagetti was overcooked and the chicken was bland. My husband had a steak and didn't like it much either.  Service was okay but I couldn't help myself from letting the waitress know that we weren't too pleased with the food and whether the cooks even knew what they were doing. She stayed quiet, guess she already knew how terrible the food is."}
{"text":"Picked this location for a party of 16 with dietary restrictions (halal).  Ambience and decor is more on the casual side and menu is definitely more \"comfort food\" influence.   They have burgers and steaks and do not serve alcohol.  The drinks are pretty good though.  

The restaurant was basically empty during lunch hour but picked up a tiny bit during our stay and they only had one waitress but it looked like the manager stepped in to help.  Very courteous staff and would go back for a quick bite but not for any kind of celebration meal."}
{"text":"Loved loved loved the 4 cheese chicken.  My boyfriend had the steak but it was too fatty. Service was wonderful. Wil come back"}
{"text":"this place has definitely left a great impression with us. been here about 3 times now and have to say their customer service is on point. they are very accommodating and helpful. were able yo answer all requests and served quickly and efficiently.

the food is very tasteful. among our parties we have had their potato skins and they are a plate to have each time. we have had their chicken dishes and steaks and each ti me the dishes have been cooked right and flavorful. the portion sizes are big enough to have left overs for next day. each dish was served warm and freshly made

the ambience of the restaurant is a little dull but it is spacious and clean and is able to hold large parties. bathrooms are small but do the job. perhaps they should bring in more dessert and drink options with a bar but not really necessary.

overall great spot to have a good tasteful dinner"}
{"text":"This is the first time went here as all other place were closed due to family day. Though the food here is good ,they make you wait for 35-40 mins for a dish without giving a reason or sorry."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying I've never left a 1 star review for any restaurant. I hate to have to damage a restaurant's reputation with a negative review but I feel this may help the owners improve their menu.
I went there on a Friday night in February with my parents. The restuarant only had one family there, it was empty otherwise. The decor is alright, there really was no ambience as the restauarant was empty. That week had been very cold, -20 almost daily. That Friday was warmer so I was surprised that more people hadn't come out. 
Simpy put, the food was not good. When you factor in the price you pay here, the food doesn't stand up to it. The menu sounded great, so we ordered eagerly. But the execution was poor. We got potato skins, filet mignon, rib eye and fish and chips. The potato skins were filled with what tasted like packaged shredded cheese. There was supposed to be pieces of steak in there but we found hardly one piece. 

The potato skins were very tough, almost burnt and with no seasoning whatsoever. Eating the potato skins was like a chore. 

The fish and chips were made with haddock but the fish filets were extremely thin. The fish also looked like it was packaged and frozen, not fresh. The batter was not homemade. 

The rib eye steak wasn't cooked properly, it didn't taste fresh. Tasted like it was previously frozen and old. The chimichuri sauce on the side was actually pretty good.

The filet mignon was excellent. We had ordered mushroom sauce on the side but it tasted identical to the gravy that came with the mashed potatoes and it was a very unappetizing brown colour, the texture was offputting. 

The service was excellent, the hostess and our server were very pleasant and helpful. The taste simply wasn't there. I regretted having spent almost $100 after tip for a dinner I really didn't like. If you're looking for halal steak, there are better places to go. At least until Crave improves their menu."}
