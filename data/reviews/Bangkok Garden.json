{"text":"This Mom & Pop Thai restaurant is a gem! My neighbor took me here to try their favorite spot for Thai and I felt at ease as soon as I walked in. The decor is traditional Thai - lots of Wood Carvings and plenty of Indoor plants. The owners are friendly, warm and welcoming and quick to make you happy. It was the small touches here that made this place stand out.   The twisted flower on the straw that came on the Thai Tea (which was cool, delicious and made me alert for the next 8 hours) was just one of those things that you just don't see anymore. The attention to detail on the straw made me excited for what was to come.   I ordered the Pad See Ew with Beef and very spicy (1-5 I went with 4) and it was excellent. The noodles were perfectly cooked and full of flavor. I added more chili's from the spice container but I enjoy a lot of heat. Lunch comes with a spring roll and chicken soup. They also brought chicken on a stick for my daughter. She seemed to enjoy it.   Overall a wonderful lunch experience and I can't wait to return."}
{"text":"Massaman Curry was delicious! Very large portions and great service.  I eat Thai regularly, and used to make a 30 min drive to my favorite Thai restaurant.  I was pleased to find a Thai place 5 minutes away.  This places is a hidden gem, which makes the quiet atmosphere even better!  Our waitress was very good at taking special orders and making suggestions (even though I get the same thing everytime)    She gives you the option of 1-5 spicy scale.  Be bold, and pick a higher level of spiciness!"}

{"text":"Very authentic and, Joy, the owner is so personable, she will remember your name on your next visit.  Steam Dumplings and the Larb are a must.  I never knew this gem was in my own backyard."}
