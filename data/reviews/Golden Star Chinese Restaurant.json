{"text":"I ordered food for delivery on a Sunday and was told the driver wouldn't be in until 4pm, this is before 3pm. So I called back and placed my order at 330 then was told he wouldn't be at my place till 430 and he wasn't here until 5pm.  I was not at all impressed with the food. We ordered the black pepper steak and kung pao shrimp. They had no taste or flavour and was sitting in a pool of watered down sauce.  I wouldn't suggest this place or go there again myself."}
{"text":"I've been here couple times and the service always annoyed me but it was convenient for me so I just went for the food (well.. some days the food wasn't too great either which I think was the result from new chefs joining).   I went there today and the owner changed! I have to say the new owners were so much more friendly and nicer! The owner is also the chef at the back so I don't have to worry about the inconsistency of the food quality anymore, haha (I should have taken a picture but I forgot but I will definitely be back there so I will upload it next time!).  Hopefully the place will be good each time I go back and it can become my go to place for my Chinese Food Takeout, lol!"}
{"text":"My lady and I were feeling some Chinese, so we thought we'd give Golden Star at Heart Lake Town Center a whirl.  The inside is your typical take out place: A few tables, and waiting customers. The menu is also pretty typical, nothing really stood out as a specialty item.  The ordering process was infuriating, which almost earned the place a 2-star review. One woman remarked about her 40-minute wait just as we had arrived, when all she had ordered was 1 container of fried rice. Gad-zooks! We stood at the counter for about 10 minutes, while the young girl kept taking call-in orders the whole time, never apologizing for us standing there, or even saying \"hey, I'll just be one more second\". We ended up walking out, and phoning in our order for delivery from the parking lot.  Once connected, I was put on hold for a few minutes, and when she came back, she hung up on me by accident. I call back, and she apologizes.  What followed is what happens when a hungry man goes up against an obviously overwhelmed girl on a Friday night. I had to give my address 3 times, spell it twice, give the major intersection I live at, then say my order 3 times. I'm pretty sure I would've been less frustrated juggling chainsaws than dealing with that call, as she never quite seemed fully 'with it'. Anyway, the order was placed, and we could at least wait for the order at my house instead of in the restaurant.  The order came within 45 minutes, and it was all accurate.  The only saving grace was the food itself. Not bad at all.  I would eat from them again, but next time I'll be smart enough to have it delivered, and order well in advance."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place for Chinese food! It always tastes great without feeling like you're just eating salt and their food is quite authentic! Reasons why I love this place:  Food: I always get their Spicy Crispy Dry Chicken and its the absolute best! Great tangy and spicy flavor with a mix of onions and lots of chilies. It's always super crispy and piping hot with juicy chicken pieces! I love the blend of chilies that is stir-fried with it as well as the garlic and onions, they add an extra kick of flavor that marries everything together! Awesome dish on the menu, I definitely recommend! I change up with the Ho Fun and Shanghai Noodles, which are both very good. Great bursting flavors and noodles are always cooked perfectly. The noodles, veggies and meat always have that char from the wok, knowing it's quite authentic. The flavors are get, never too salty, just the right amount! I definitely recommend either of those two as well! Also I have noticed, for their crispy dishes, they always make small holes in the containers it's in so the steam doesn't make it soggy, and keeps it still warm and crispy, I love that they do that! And they give fortune cookies for every purchase!  Service: I'm always greeted everytime I walk in. I come here on occasion, been there about 3-4 times but haven't been there in a couple months so I decided to go today. I called my order beforehand and it's ALWAYS prepared within the time I'm told, barely any waiting! I paid and the cashier asks if I've been here before, clearly remembering my visits even though it has been months since I've been there! She is always so kind and asks if I need extra cutlery or napkins and wraps everything up nicely. And she is so nice when leaving and makes sure she gets your order right! Excellent service here!  The restaurant itself is very clean and comfortable, there are dining tables as well as waiting tables for take-out. They have two TVs on CP24 which is great while waiting. They also offer lunch specials which look great and are a great deal! They also serve bubble tea! Wonderful place, very underrated!"}
{"text":"This place makes run-of-the-mill, dime-a-dozen, mediocre Chinese food something to strive for. Got the general tao beef and it was so far off what it should've been that it made me wonder if they had given me the wrong dish. Nope, they just don't know how to make it. Too bad because general tao beef is usually awesome. I guess if you're looking for chicken balls and fried rice this place can set you up but who can't do that?"}
{"text":"Love their cantonese chow Mein, salt and pepper squid and shrimp wonton soup. So yummy! My fave chinese resto in Brampton. They get very busy and have their days but I find the owners genuinely sweet.  The delivery driver forgot my drinks once, apologized and was quick to come back with it. My only issue is that sometimes their delivery isn't available (mostly during the days) and that inconsistency can be inconvenient."}
{"text":"the food is good but I'm giving this business 1 star due to lack of professionalism. I called to make an order for delivery  the lady told me the driver wasn't there so to call the other location so I said okay and then she said it's okay we will take your order I place my order and she says okay it will be over an hour. 5 minutes later she calls saying theirs no driver so I call the other location place my order and they say okay we're going to get your food ready and be on the way great! Then the lady from the sandalwood location calls back saying the driver is there and how instead they will deliver our order but no need to call the other location she will do it for us now the other location calls us back and says that the lady said we didn't want to order from them anymore and to tell the driver to turn around this was such a lie, very disappointed I wouldn't deliver from the sandalwood location ever again their was too much confusion and it made me not want the food anymore."}
{"text":"Owners changed. Great service and food quality went up. Used to be low in service quality but they really stepped up."}
{"text":"Good Chinese Food! *Thumbs Up*"}
