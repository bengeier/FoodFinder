{"text":"Great addition to the neighborhood! I had the custom salad and everything was very fresh. I hope they eventually extend their hours to stay open after 5:00 pm and on weekends."}
{"text":"Amazing veggie wrap! Nice staff. I was starving on a 12 hour layover in Charlotte. It was delicious! Reasonable in price."}
{"text":"This place is CLOSED. Tried finding it, it was a no go. The phone number is dead too."}
{"text":"It is like a healthy version of subway with wraps and salads.  Staff was very nice . I loved the  Tilipia wrap. The menu had so many good choices. When we sat down a lady that was leaving said she loved the Citrus salad. I want to go back so I can try their banana pudding."}
{"text":"I've gone here a few times and have generally been pleased with my food selection.  I love that I can get the fresh toppings on my salad. This past trip however had me so disappointed.  I'm averaging my visits as a two!  The banana pudding is good and my previous salad and flatbread were good.  The soup I tried before wasn't.   But what really dropped the rating was my visit on Wednesday. 

Here's why... 1. I ordered the Dalia salad with grilled chicken, banana pudding and a drink for $17 and change.  Really?! 2. The Dalia comes with kale and the server had to go in the kitchen and came back with a bunch of kale in her hand for my salad.  I sit outside to eat the salad and there is this weird crunchiness.  It's not the pecans. After a couple of bites I pick up a piece of kale, inspect it closely and then place it in my mouth to confirm my suspicion.  Sandy!! The darn kale wasn't washed clean.  I brought the salad back to the cashier and was told someone else had complained about that before.  They prepared me a new salad with spinach.  Uh, so where was the apology? Where was the 'let me get my manager for you'?  Nothing!!! I will not be going back there again."}
{"text":"This restaurant is great! I love how they treat me. I've been coming since they've opened, freakin delicious!!"}
{"text":"Best choice in the food court.  Not cheap but more like Food Truck concept. Great food ingredients done up well. But priced to cover overhead   I had the red pepper soup with Gouda cheese. Was as good as I have ever had.  The house crunch salad was excellent with addition of croutons (no charge) and lemon olive oil dressing option.  Fountain drink was good.  Nice staff running the bistro : they helped beyond the norm on some minor additions I requested. I recommend this Bistro. Only downer was eating the salad out if a cardboard box.  Would prefer real dishes."}
{"text":"Agree with previous reviews, best option in the mall food court.  And I like that they show the calories per item."}
{"text":"If you want to good salad and you're a buffalo chicken fan this is the place for you get the black and blue salad you won't regret it."}
{"text":"Bottom line: excellent food for food court choice!  
Pros: 
Fresh ingredients
Large menu
Friendly staff (from start to finish, which is so unusual)
Made quick
Can sit outside if you don't want to listen to the hustle and bustle of the mall food court

Cons:
A little on the pricy side for being food court, these are more in line with restaurant prices.  I had the Cali Crunch, added grilled chicken and a soft drink and it came to 10.50 

Will I be back?  Absolutely!"}
{"text":"My buffalo bleu chicken salad was crunchy, fresh, and very tasty. The poblano white cheddar soup was creamy, with a little kick...amazingly good! The staff is very friendly! 

Totally a great healthy & tasty option!"}
{"text":"This is the kind of salad/soup/sandwich place I've been hoping Charlotte would get.  It's stylish, clean, and it's got a well laid-out menu board with plenty of options, so there's bound to be something everyone likes. 

CS is located in the food court of South Park Mall, in the old Blynk Organic spot, right as you enter the food court from the parking lot.  They opened in February, right around Valentine's Day. The line moves quickly and when I went yesterday, it was packed. The folks working behind the counter were very friendly and quick to offer up their favorites and popular menu items. 

Kind of like Crisp, you've got gourmet salads, or you can create your own.  Prices wise, the gourmet salads range from $6 for a classic caesar, to $9.50 for the tilapia, which I had, and was really yummy.  (Parmesan crusted tilapia, warm on carrots, edamame, bail and spring mix w/sesame ginger dressing.) My only improvement would be to cook the fish less. The edges were just a bit too crisp/tough, but the center was moist and flavorful. 

My dining partner had the BBQ Santa Fe salad, which was excellent too-- chicken and corn, black beans, cilantro, cheese and tortilla strips.  Nothing too out of the ordinary, but put together well and very fresh.  

TIP: The salads are put into nice lightweight plastic bowls with lids, so even though the salads aren't as gargantuan and Crisp, in case you want to take it home, the container is convenient.  (Seriously, this is important!  Sometimes salad boxes leak and seep through.) 

We also had one of the soups of the day, a crab corn chowder, which was excellent, and frankly, could have been served at Upstream in a fancy bowl and nobody would have looked twice. 

You can also get wraps, flatbreads and kids items (mmm, Nutella and berry wrap!), along with side items that are a bit more unique than at say, Subway, and more on-par with Au Bon Pain.  Think, Ms. Vicky's chips, baked chips, and those little hummus containers with flat pretzel chips.  

You'll pay less here than at Dean and Deluca (and honestly, they have most of the same salad items here...maybe even more when you count the different proteins, like teriyaki chicken and pork tenderloin) and won't be overwhelmed with salad like at Crisp.  (Though, don't get me wrong, I LOVE me some Crisp.) 

Can't wait to try out some more items!"}
{"text":"The Buffalo Blue salad ROCKED at only 380 calories. It was delicious and filling. Excellent portion, very fresh and fabulously prepaired in front of us. Will make this new place one of my frequently visited favorites."}
{"text":"My buffalo chicken wrap was delicious and my wife's salad was great. My wife ordered the southwest salad and she said it was one of the best she has ever hand. For being in the food court of a mall this place was great. I can't wait to go eat this place again. I would recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"Got the buffalo chicken flatbread. I was satisfied it was delicious, but the prices are a bit high for what you get. All in all I would go back and try out other parts of the menu. Love the small outdoor seating, I ate outside with my dogs after walking four mile creek greenway."}
{"text":"Today was there grand opening. I had there turkey Cobb salad and it was amazing. Very quick and the vegetables were fresh. Definitely a good lunch and breakfast spot."}
{"text":"I was excited to try this place as I have heard nothing but great reviews.
The place is clean and staff is very friendly. I also like how they put the calorie count next to the prices.
The prices are reasonable.
I ordered the Buffalo Bleu Salad to go and it looked delicious.
Unfortunately, after getting home and eating it, I  found 'grit\" in 3 bites. 
I thought at first, maybe the onions but, no, it was 'grit' like the lettuce hadn't been washed.
I had to toss it."}
{"text":"Good place to grab a quick lunch.  There were about 10 people in line but they moved it very quickly.  The food tasted great. It was a little further than other places in uptown but I will be back."}
{"text":"I'm sold especially with the Kids eat FREE on Sunday with the purchase of an adult entree. Not to mention the fact that this place is in the same lot as Olive This and Trader Joe's which both are my Sunday go to's . 
I had a yummy cranberry and goat cheese spinach salad  which was awesome. My husband had a flatbread which he enjoyed and our son had a cheese flatbread which he enjoyed.
Glad we got a chance to check this place out. The process is like a sandwich line, you can see all the ingredients and ask for what you want on your salad, flatbread or wrap. The staff is pretty cool and appear to love their job from our experience as they were happy and helpful which are two great qualities."}
{"text":"I love this place!   They have healthy, great tasting salads, wraps, flatbread pizzas, and quinoa bowls.  I remember this place inside Southpark Mall a few years back, but now they've opened one in Piper Glen.  My favorite is the BBQ Santa Fe but I've heard great things about all their items.  I noticed that they always have a great selection of unique soups as well.  Not the typical stuff you see a Panera or other sandwich places.  

You can't go wrong at Crunch Bistro.  It's a super clean and modern looking place and the service is good too."}
{"text":"Great new spot!! Quick service healthy food spot!!  Finally!! Salads are big and the quinoa bowls are awesome! Very good stuff!"}
{"text":"Crunch Bistro. Holy hell. I honestly wasn't even going to review this place until after I had started eating my wrap from there. Shame on me. As soon as I took my first bite, I got excited to leave a review. Best fast casual experience I think I have ever had.

My girlfriend and I were going to catch a movie in Ballantyne and saw that Crunch was just a little ways away, so we decided to stop by. The restaurant is very clean and bright, and the two people that helped me were super nice and helpful. 

I got a custom wrap with chicken, romaine, cucumber, onion, pepper, bacon, croutons, and honey mustard. Did I say wrap? I mean BURRITO. This dude loaded me up so hard I felt bad for him trying to roll it up into one wrap. Speaking of wraps, they had wheat, spinach, tomato basil, and one other that sounded great. I went with tomato basil and it was a noticeable difference.

The best thing about the wrap was hands down the chicken. EVERY single bite I had the chicken was charred and juicy. Imagine the best chicken you've ever had from chipotle and then imagine that in every bite you take. Just so damn good.

The guy that served me let me know they have $6 wraps on Wednesdays which is insane. Even if you go on a normal day it's super worth it.

CAN'T WAIT TO GO BACK!"}
{"text":"Went here for an early take-out dinner. Got the Mo' Chicken wrap. You choose your chicken (BBQ, Buffalo, and several others) and you choose your dressing if you want any. Many other items on the menu but I'm a sucker for wraps!

Service was reasonable though not speedy. Friendly staff.
Food quality was really good.
Value was pretty good; my wrap cost $7.85 and was a generous size; not skimpy.

Because it's at the SouthPark Mall food court, you can eat indoors or go just a few steps and eat at one of the (usually shaded) outdoor tables in the courtyard."}
{"text":"Simply the best place for salads n wraps...and their flatbreads are amazing too...the salad quantity is more and their veggie wrap is good...i havent tried their non veg items as im a vegetarian...usually its hard for a vegetarian to find a decent place for a meal thats as satisfying as this wrap...because we wont have anything apart from a salad in most of the restaurants...but i finally found this amazing place with a yummy veggie wrap"}
{"text":"After going to a competitor and receiving horrible service...good salad, but bad service I decided to try y'all! I'm so glad I did! Overall the experience was great...I loved being able to fill out a card for my salad selections, the young man behind the counter was super fast at making my food and communicated to the cashier what I ordered so I had paid for it before it was done being made. I would love there to be a beef option for my salad and the grilled chicken was a little dry...but like I said, overall very nice! Clean inside, gleaming white interior..."}
{"text":"Definitely, the most fresh option in South Park Mall! I love their options, and if they have the roasted peppers soup, do not leave without trying it!"}
{"text":"I eat here atleast twice a week, and it never disappoints. The ranch is amazing, and the customer service is great. Except for one person. Every time i go in there he is rude and never looks me in the eyes. But don't let one person stop you from trying this amazing place. It's quick and reasonably priced. 
They also have a punch card, so take advantage of that"}
{"text":"I like this place. I had a salad and it was a huge salad, which makes the price worth it. They could chop up their chicken a little bit more, I just don't like huge chunks of chicken in my salad. It's conveniently located and even 3pm, I was able to find street parking out front."}
{"text":"The perfect healthy choice in a mall! Great options and the pork verde soup is amazing! Has just enough spicy for me considering I hate spicy food. The tilapia wrap is my new addiction considering I'm in love with all the flatbread choices. I've never had a bad option from them and I've been a loyal customer for a year!"}
{"text":"Today was the 2nd time at this amazing place. Is this a chain ?? Nope ...looks like it is a local thing that started at a kiosk in South Park Mall. It is AMAZING so good ...clean nice staff in a great little strip mall. We quickly got the crunch card to get it punched each visit to get a free lunch. It will get filled up VERY quick. I had the veggie wrap...I say this with 100% honesty...it's the best I have ever had. Hubby had Spicy Buffalo Flat Bread ...he wanted to get 2 of them they were so good. So my advise...GO There Now!!"}
{"text":"They custom made my wrap to avoid dairy and it was fantastic. It was also huge, good for at least two meals but so good I ate it all at once."}
{"text":"So yummy! Great lunch spot and $6 wraps on Wednesday's! The ranch was really good and all the ingredients were super super fresh! In and out pretty quick and the staff was friendly! Only down fall is it's a pretty busy shopping center but the wrap was so good I'll go back!"}
{"text":"Went here for lunch with my boyfriend who works uptown-found a perfect meter spot on the street right in front. 

The line was short, and the menu has more items than what is pictured from other users. They have açaí bowls and parfaits. You can make any salad a wrap for no upcharge, which I did. 

I got the buffalo chicken salad in a garlic wrap-SO GOOD! Grilled chicken, romaine, red onions, tomatoes, blue cheese crumbles, buffalo sauce, blue cheese dressing and some kind of crunchy something (maybe fried onions?). So good, and a filling portion. I also got the Cactus Chili which was chunky, meaty and just the right spice. $28 for two wraps, a cup of chili and a drink to share. Not ridiculous, but not cheap either. Overall I'd say it's more than worth it, and I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Not sure how long this spot has been opened, but I went for a walk during lunch not really knowing what I wanted and I ended up here.  They have fresh salads, wraps, quinoa bowls, and flatbreads.  The servers were very nice and and very patient with me because as usual I couldn't decide on anything. I finally ended up with a veggie wrap(spinach, cucumbers, mushrooms, tomatoes, red peppers, sautéed onions, jalapeños, and cilantro lime dressing.  I won't tell you how incredibly delicious it was, but I will say that I returned 3 days in row for that veggie wrap.  If you're looking for something light and refreshing, give them a try."}
{"text":"After a rough night of shopping I was ready to eat my new shoes I was so hungry. I'm in from NYC and am spoiled at home by all the healthy vegan and vegetarian options. As much as I like visiting Charlotte, there's usually more barbecue than vegetarian options.

Then I found crunch bistro. The staff were so nice and proud of their work and their food. Now I see why. Everything was so fresh! I ordered the veggie d-lite wrap and it was fabulous. I wanted three more when I was done.

I will definitely keep this place at the top of my list when returning to the South Park mall when I visit Charlotte! 

What a gem!"}
{"text":"I was going home while picking my son up from school. He requested me to take him at crunch Bistro so we went there.

Nice interior, clean and helpful staffs, I liked that.  My son ordered buffalo chicken wrap with his favorite ingredients. All meat and vegetables looks freshly made. My son enjoyed his meal and said thank you dad to bring me this place.


Next time, I am gonna try with my whole family."}
{"text":"Healthy good. Friendly.

Got the Groupon a while ago. Good for lunch, but without the Groupon, I'd rather go to Whole Foods around the corner for their salad bar and variety.

One of my co-workers loves this place! I like it too since from what I understand it's locally owned, use fresh ingredients, but for the value and flavor, it is a solid 3 stars."}
{"text":"The barbecue Sante Fe salad here is so yummy and the dressing has just the right amount of spice!"}
{"text":"Great fast fresh spot in south Charlotte. You go up front and can order a wrap, salad, or flatbread from their menu or you can build your own.  Be warned, the place is extremely small and cramped so not good for groups but makes for a good take out spot. It's always been very clean when I go.  Service was slow today as a new girl was training.  

I usually get the BBQ santa fe salad - sub spicy ranch for regular ranch.  There is something about the combination of bbq sauce and ranch that I love!  The salad portions are huge! I usually can't finish the whole thing.  

They offer free kids meal on Sunday w/ an adult entree purchase and also $6 dollar wraps on Wednesdays!"}
{"text":"This place is located in the mall food court and I stopped here for a quick lunch when i was here on business once. I have never heard of this chain before so i thought i would give it a try. I ordered a pizza and enjoyed it very much!! I mean it is in a food court so you can't expect to be blown away, but for what I got there i loved it.

I think i loved it since you could get food you would want to originally get at the mall, but this is the healthier version you can get and not hate yourself after eating all of it. I do not think i wold love going here all the time if i had one around me, but for what it is i cannot complain. Definitely a place to go to when you are wanting something to eat that is not completely horrible for you!"}
{"text":"Great healthy dining option in Southpark mall. It lacks character a bit- but it is quick for the most part. I went during lunch and ordered salads and wraps for myself and other co-workers. Pros: Reasonably priced- nothing over $10 and fresh made to order salads. I didn't like that did not ask how I wanted my protein cooked like Crisp does but maybe there is a temperature rule on pork. I can't wait to try out some of their other offerings like the shrimp BLT wrap. Overall, a solid healthy option but not knock down amazing."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! Guilt free food that tastes delicious! The staff is always very warm and friendly.  I love that there are so many options to choose from. The wraps are huge I usually can't eat the whole thing in one setting unless I'm extremely hungry.  I love the fact that you can turn any of the salads into a wrap  nom-nom."}
{"text":"I came for breakfast and was pleased.  It is a good place for healthy choices. Portions are ample but not so large that they make you overfull.

Coffee is pick-your-own from an automated espresso machine.  I had an Americano and it was better than I hoped when I saw the arrangement.  

They have 3 yogurt bases; my Navi parfait yogurt had camu camu added, and a nice portion of fresh almonds and chia seeds.

I look forward to coming again."}
{"text":"Love the food here, but service is slow, particularly on Wednesdays (wrap special day)."}
{"text":"Somewhat shocked by the bad reviews.  

Location was *very clean* to the point I felt self-conscious sitting down in my running gear; it is located next to the greenway, so it makes a great healthy option after a long run or walk.

Ordered the Pollo Picante, a quinoa bowl with chicken, black beans, jalapeños, cilantro, and spicy dressing.  Was wonderful but a little too much heat for my tastes.  Lady ordered the margherita flatbread.  Was wonderful and light. Everything appeared and tasted fresh

Anyone looking for healthy options in the area should definitely check this out.

Only suggestions:  
1)  wish there was another 4-seater outdoor table. 
2)  would be nice if there was option to sub in tofu for the other proteins."}
{"text":"Come on man! Could this tiny little \"salad joint\" really be as good as all of its five star reviews on Yelp? Well... Yupp! Even at 7:30 on a Saturday night with only one incredibly capable and talented young man named Johnnathan working, the entire place was immaculate, the service was fast, friendly and efficient, and the food was as superb as it was fresh. I'm going to cut to the chase and state up front that this place is indeed a Gotta Try so you can go ahead and head there now. You can read the rest of my review in the car on the way (and you'd be wise to also take a peek at the menu as it is extensive.)

Speaking of the menu, it includes all kinds of healthy stuff served up as salads, wraps, flatbread and grain bowls. My wife and I went conservative and ordered a Veggie Delight wrap and a Pesto Portobella flatbread. The actual wraps themselves are available with white, wheat or spinach flour, which is a nice touch in itself. I opted for the spinach flour and only added cilantro to the wrap's baby spinach, cukes, grilled Bu on Mushrooms, tomatoes, shredded carrots, roasted red peppers, caramelized onions, jalapeños, feta cheese and house cilantro lime dressing. It was excellent, as was the flatbread, that included goat cheese, pesto, portabella mushrooms, spinach, fomatoes and parmesan. The total bill ran $22 including two fountain drinks.

With the speed and bravada of a Nakata Japanese chef, Johnnathan expertly prepared our food, was conscientious enough to remove sanitary gloves before collecting money, checked us out, put on new gloves, handled his next customers, and then walked around the small dining area cleaning off the tables and checking on us customers. Very impressive indeed!

The only negative as far as I'm concerned is that the dining area is so darned small. Unless you get one of the two tables in front of the windows, the rest of the tables are very tight. In fact, I felt like I had to shift forward every time someone walked behind me. So, in conclusion, I give the place five stars as a take out option, and four stars for dining in. Either way, like I said earlier, it is a Gotta Try (especially  if the young Crunch Ninja is working.)"}
{"text":"Couldn't find this place. Has it gone out of business??? Can someone please confirm. I don't want others to make the mistake of going to the mall food court only to be disappointed by lack of healthy options..."}
{"text":"I did not enjoy my oatmeal, but the Cali Crunch salad is fire! Thoroughly enjoyed it! Get it with the cilantro lime dressing"}
{"text":"Good fresh food.   The staff was impatient to move us along even though no one else was there.   They did not explain how it worked.   If I'm going to pay this kind of money I'd rather go to Chopped."}
{"text":"Popped in here for the first time for a quick dinner and will totally be back - soon!  My salad (BBQ Santa Fe) was so fresh and delicious.  The chicken had so much flavor and the dressing was really good.  I was impressed with how clean and nice the space was - even peering back into the kitchen.  My husband had a flatbread pizza which looked really good.  I was too into my salad to even ask for a bite before he finished it.  

Small space with less than 10 tables, seems like a better place to grab food to go.  Will be back!"}
{"text":"Ordered online and food was ready 15 minutes later. Ordered the pepperoni flatbread and it was amazing. You can truly tell how fresh the ingredients are. I also ordered the Greek salad and it was exactly what you want when you order a Greek salad.  Plenty of olives and feta and tomatoes, not like some salads where ingredients are skimpy. Will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"After reading so many fab reviews about Crunch, we had to give them a try, and we're so glad we did! We placed an order for delivery recently: a Crunch Chicken Wrap, a BBQ Santa Fe Salad, a Cilantro Chicken Quinoa Bowl and a Pesto Portabella Flatbread. All exceeded our expectations with the exception of the Flatbread which was missing its cheese and had a meager amount of veggies. Considering it is priced about the same as the first three items I mentioned, I recommend sticking with those categories. We will definitely be ordering from Crunch in the future!"}
{"text":"Went here today for the first time, it was definitely worth the drive from Mooresville. I got the cilantro chicken quinoa bowl, everything was extremely fresh and delicious. I can't wait to go back to try something different, they had so much to choose from. Loved the fact they made everything right in front of you too. Only negative there isn't more in charlotte"}
{"text":"Asian salad is good but had very little meat for $9. Everything was fresh. The checkout was somewhat slow, they could use another register. It would be nice if they had recycle bins for the bowls, bags etc."}
{"text":"Spoiler Alert: this place isn't here anymore. I have a long winded story about looking for it... But I'll spare the details."}
{"text":"I tried Crunch out on a recent visit to the mall.  I have to say I wasn't expecting a whole lot from a healthy restaurant found within the food court of the mail, but I was presently surprised.  I had the buffalo chicken wrap (replacing the ranch with blue cheese) and it was delicious.  Although the wrap was a little pricier than some of the other food court options ($7+), it was delicious. I will definitely be visiting again."}
{"text":"The Asian Crunch salad was simple, fresh, and delicious. Very generous portion as well. I will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"I've eaten here 3 days in a row to try a variety of menu items (unusual for me).  Everything I've had was made with quality ingredients and tasted great.  The employees are nice and friendly.  I'm so happy this place opened up near my office because many lunch options are farther away towards the Overstreet mall and epicentre."}
{"text":"My dining mate and I enjoyed our salads at this small bistro. Menu has all kinds of salads with proteins ( salmon, tilapia, , turkey, chicken,  bacon, tuna, etc, flat breads, wraps, soups, quinoa bowls, and  kid's meals . Ingredients are fresh, soups delivered  daily from their distributor. One can compose their own salads also from the fresh medley of ingredients . Prices moderate.  Atmosphere clean and light and bright in small bistro. Soda, juices and water in cooler.  Desserts such as fresh fruit, granola bar and homemade banana pudding. We enjoyed our fresh salads which were very tasty with generous portions of ingredients. Chicken was warm and tender, veges very fresh. Staff accommodating and friendly."}
{"text":"This place is hardly a healthy alternative if your ordering a salad it mostly consist of lettuce with four topping if your making your own; which ends up looking like bird toppings sprinkled on top. Everything else is considered premium toppings costing additional for each. The salmon quinoa bowl is sprayed with a thick layer of sysco cooking spray yuck! I don't know why they don't ask you first that stuff is toxic, better option would be coconut oil or olive oil. I had to request them give me new spinach cause I didn't want any spray on it. The girl at the register was not friendly at all however the asian girl was and every table was dirty covered with food on them. Overall i would not waste my money here again easier to go to the store and spend less making your own to your liking."}
{"text":"Great little spot tucked into the row of shops next to Trader Joe's.   Go here if you want a fresh quinoa bowl or wrap or salad or soup.  They also have a kid's menu.  Today, I had a quinoa bowl with picante chicken.  My friend, VP, had a fresh salad that was large enough to feed all of south Charlotte.  My quinoa bowl had a decent amount of delicious chicken in it and was topped by many jalapeño slices. I would order the same dish again, and actually look forward to it.   While we were there, I noticed that there was not a lot of traffic coming through.  The place was very sleepy.   My guess is that people have just not discovered this as an option.  There is no other reason why people are not flocking here:   Good food, great sanitation score, and convenient location.  I hope this place makes it!"}
{"text":"Ordered the turkey cobb salad.

Turkey was lunchmeat.

Salad was iceberg lettuce.

Um..."}
{"text":"Had a chance to sample Crunch Bistro with a fellow Yelper on a mommy-and-baby outing. I ordered a Mo Chicken buffalo wrap and they prepared it fresh right there! When I went to pay, I realized they served beer and wine--- SCORE! I ordered a Shock Top for myself and fellow mommy.... Prob the best food court lunch a new mom could ask for. The wrap was also delicious and convenient to eat while juggling a newborn! Yay for a new fave spot at SouthPark mall!"}
{"text":"Very tasty salad here and filling portions I also appreciate the rewards card I recommend the cilantro lime dressing it's really good"}
{"text":"You know.. It's sometimes hard trying a brand new place that you've never heard of.

I started working at this mall 3 months ago and Crunch has become my go to place for the fresh food and customization options.

The food is always good and the staff is always willing to accommodate you no matter what! :)"}
{"text":"Portabello mushroom, roma tomato, feta cheese flatbread was delish. A little pricy but you're paying for the all natural local ingredients which made for fresh taste. Got that and bottled h20 for about 10.50$"}
{"text":"There is such thing as a free lunch! Very nice girl informed me they give full value on expired groupons! Love this place always fresh and yummy with friendly staff."}
{"text":"I didn't know what to try first. I ended up getting the turkey, bacon, ranch wrap. Everything looked so fresh! It was a good size wrap. It is a great place if you are looking for something healthy. Great place to grab something and go. There is seating inside and they even have a couple of small tables outside."}
{"text":"Great new spot in uptown for healthy eats! On my first visit, I had the cilantro chicken quinoa bowl but added jalapeños, onions and mushrooms. I'm happy I added the jalapeños especially as I like spice/heat and think the bowl would have been just a little bland without them. 

Service was super friendly on my visit and all the food was incredibly fresh and colorful! Prices were reasonable. Not much on the menu over $10. I can't wait to get back and try the lavash flat breads. Healthy pizza?! Sign. Me. Up! Again, SO excited to have a spot for fresh, healthy food in uptown. 

Fun that they offer breakfast in addition to lunch! I hope they do a good enough business to extend their evening hours. (Right now, they close at 5pm. I'd love to see them stay open until 6:30pm or 7:00pm.) It would be so nice to have a healthy option to stop in for a salad, grain bowl or lavash flatbread/wrap before evening shows at Blumenthal."}
{"text":"Thank you for bringing a fast, affordable, downright delicious salad spot to uptown.  Had the southwest salad and it was great. Will definitely come back."}
{"text":"The food here is terrific, especially if you're looking to eat healthier...and let's face it, living in the South we all can benefit from eating healthier every now and then. It's a nice addition to the South Park Mall food court.

I'm a fan of their salads. I have ordered their flatbreads too, which are also good. But if I'm in the mood for a salad and I'm in the area, you can bet that I'll come to Crunch. The menu is laid out nicely and there are plenty of options, including a create your own. The use only the freshest of ingredients. 

The only downside is that if it gets busy and the line gets long you may have to wait a bit. But that's a sign of a good place right?

The price is a bit higher than some of the other food court options, but you get what you pay for here. Quality, tasty, healthy food. It's a must that you check out Crunch if you're in the mall."}
{"text":"Today was the second time eating here.  And besides the fact that the chicken on the chicken Caesar salad reminds me of warm tuna, everything else is really good.  I don't know maybe its me but chicken poached or not shouldn't taste like warm tuna....lol.  Any who I've been looking for places where you can create your own salad and this is a good one despite the taste which probably makes no sense to you I really love the chicken Caesar salad.  I wish it was one in the Matthews area, y'all should try it."}
{"text":"I went yesterday and was so pleased. I chose to make my own creation and was so pleasantly surprised. My daughter also chose to make her own salad and also was pleasantly surprised. This place definitely gets my vote I will go back there time and time again. The environment is inviting and very clean staff was knowledgeable and it was done in excellence which I love."}
{"text":"I was very pleased with Crunch Bistro, and I have to say, I have never been served a salad that was more fresh. Normally, you are bound to find at least one semi-gross item in a salad; whether it be a rotting piece of lettuce or a slimy spinach leaf...there's always something. The lettuce in my Cobb salad was perfection. Delicious and fresh. They used a fresh avocado and I received a half in my salad, hand cut right before my eyes. The dressing was perfect. Everything was so yummy. The employees were young and when I was there they had a lunch rush- a line of people extending to the door. They were fast, professional, and performed extremely well under pressure. They were friendly with me and my baby daughter and said hello to us as soon as things calmed down. I will be back!

One critique, the shape of the salad bowl was very deep and narrow, making it difficult to eat and get a good distribution of toppings and dressing from top to bottom."}
{"text":"Crunch Bistro is everything. The veggies are fresh, the chicken is INCREDIBLY flavorful and tender, and the wraps are filled to the brim! I cannot recommend this place enough. They have wraps, bowls, salads, flatbreads-everything you could want!
Special shoutout to the Chicken Caesar wrap, which is my go-to."}
{"text":"I hate malls and refuse to shop in them, which is what kept me away from Crunch initially.  Today my lunch partner said he wanted a good salad for lunch so I went to Yelp! and typed \"salad\" into the search bar- Crunch came up and had a bunch of positive reviews.  Since there's not a great salad place around our work, I decided to take the bull by the horns and try Crunch.  I was delighted to find that it's right inside the food court door at South Park, so I didn't really have to go inside the mall after all  :-)

The choices were varied, the food was made as I stood there and the ingredients were fresh and tasty!  For $11.99 I walked away with a turkey cobb salad and a drink with free refills.  It was fresh and super tasty - We'll definitely be back  :-)"}
{"text":"Quick & Easy Healthy Food . They Have A Wide Variety & Everything I've Tried Has Been Delicious . Clean Atmosphere , Friendly Staff , & Nice Outdoor Seating ."}
{"text":"In a food court full of calorie filled menus (and people entirely too overdressed to go shopping), it's refreshing to have a guilt-free option like Crunch Bistro.

My order: Portobello Wrap. Sun dried tomato tortilla. roasted portobellos, goat cheese, roasted red peppers, caramelized onions, spinach and balsamic vinaigrette. Portobellos, goat cheese and roasted red peppers: a trio of perfection. Every sandwich, wrap, salad, whatevs... should contain those three items. 

My lunchtime friends went with salads: the Waldorf and the Cali Crunch. Both added portobellos. The salads looked amazing. The ingredients... so fresh. I can not wait to go back and get one.

Crunch seems like a pretty popular spot in the food court. Steady stream of people during the hour and half I was there. I must say, it is discouraging to look around at the tables and see parents feeding their kids fast food when there's such a delicious and healthy place like this there. 

This will be my new go-to spot to grab grub when I'm shopping at SouthPark Mall. If you see a girl wearing pajamas in the food court, say hi. It'll probably me. I'm pretty sure I'm the only who goes to the mall not dressed to the nines."}
{"text":"Good portions! Great value!  Healthy menu. I have been in twice and both times I order Cilantro Chicken Bowl and there is a heap of tender chicken that crown the quinoa, tomato, corn dish with a good balance of cilantro sauce/dressing.  I always sample Their daily soups, and I always end up getting a cup because it is good and yummy.  My son ordered the barbecue chicken flatbread, and he was satisfied - favor wise and portion wise.  
I will continue to come to this place since I shop next door at Trader Joe's."}
{"text":"I can't speak to the other food, but I had the Veggie D-lite wrap there today and it was worth five stars by itself. Delicious food, fast, and friendly service. I hope they open one in the South End area, I'll go frequently."}
{"text":"My new fav spot to eat at south park mall. All fresh , healthier , and yummy selections . I tried the tilapia salad with cilantro lime dressing , deeeelliiccciiooouuus! Tilapia was nicely seasoned , and there was plenty of extra toppings to make this salad filling and not boring ."}
{"text":"Super fresh food for the healthy person who is on the go! Amazing salad, wrap and bowl options. Everything is extra fresh and tastes amazing. The customer service is great. They also have an online ordering option if you need to get in and out quickly. I got the build your own salad and ordered the warm salmon quinoa bowl for my mom. We loved them both!! ! Highly recommend. :)"}
{"text":"Excellent take out option in mall. I had the Asian chicken it was so delicious and fresh.  Lobster bisque was as good as any you get in a sit down restaurant.  My mouth is watering  just thinking about the food.  Which  is pretty amazing for a salad!! In a  food court!! At the mall !!   ..And friendly staff !! Great job"}
{"text":"The best food court meal I've ever had! The wraps, salads and flatbreads are made with such fresh and healthy ingredients, it's even hard to call this place a 'food court' restaurant... I think of it as more of a modern cafe.

The food is delicious! I am a frequent shopper of South Park mall and cannot help but go to Crunch every time. My favorites are the BBQ Santa Fe and Tilapia salads. I can't pick just one! I really like the crunch that the little tortilla strips give the BBQ Santa Fe. And don't even get me started on the delicious cilantro lime vinaigrette on the Tilapia salad.. I could seriously drink that stuff it's so good!! Most of the time, I would be wary to eat fish in a food court but never once have I second guessed Crunch's freshness! I talked to one of their employees and he told me they get all of their produce from a place in Rock Hill, SC. LOVE that they support local farmers and produce! 

Crunch Bistro is a must when stopping by the South Park area. Heck, I'd even go there to eat even if I wasn't shopping in the mall! I'm obsessed."}
{"text":"my dad and I ate here after going to Trader Joe's and Great Harvest. Wed is $6 wrap special. I had the chicken crunch and he had chicken salad, both on spinach wraps. delish. will definitely eat here again."}
{"text":"Although this restaurant is located in SouthPark Mall, do not discount it! The prices are higher than other places, but the flavors make it worth it!

I wanted a healthier option for dinner and we chose to go to the food court so each family member could pick the type of food they wanted. 

I ordered the asian crunch salad and it was a delight! I loved the various flavors in it and it was very satisfying.  Be aware that is comes with chicken on it. They heated the chicken which is a nice touch, but I don' t eat meat.  So, next time...I will know.  

The 5 spice dressing was wonderful too!  I would order this again when I feel like splurging and spending money on a salad."}
{"text":"When I want a good salad and healthy food guess where I think of? Crunch Bistro.I have my regular cravings for the most perfect salad- The Parmesan Encrusted Tilapia coming in at a super low 234 Calories. The thing I love about this place is the way the calories are listed on the board, so when I'm really watching what I eat I come here. Especially when your on the run at the mall and want to make a better choice this food court restaurant will make the cut! My other favorite dishes here are the BBQ chicken flatbread and the roasted red bell pepper soup perfect on a cold winter day. Come here if you want to wide range of delicious salad, wrap and flatbreads and want to feel good and healthy about what you eat. You wont regret it :-)"}
{"text":"Not only did I leave feeling satisfied, I loved my Toscana Bowl. I was hesitant to go at first because I'm generally not in the mood to get a salad. However, I was surprised to see a full menu with wraps and flatbreads for people like me who love their bread while trying to be healthier. It's right next to the greenway so it's perfect for right before a walk or after!"}
{"text":"The pollo picante bowl was so good. It's very spicy. It's a huge portion of quinoa. I almost wish they had a smaller bowl option because $10 is tad much for quinoa and chicken, but it was really good! Will definitely be putting it in our rotation."}
{"text":"This is my new favorite \"take away\" place.  Everything I have tried so far has been healthy and very fresh.  I am hooked on the Parmesan Tilapia salad.  I could eat it everyday!! Brad and his team are friendly and the service is quick.  Great when looking for a causal quick, healthy choice...."}
{"text":"I ordered the side Ceasar Salad, fresh with a great Ceasar dressing, and the Margarita Flatbread with chicken. The flatbread was cooked to perfection and was delicious! A definite treat in the Southpark Mall Food Court. Oh, the service was exceptional as well."}
{"text":"Healthy meets great taste!

One of the most tasty stands in the food court at South Park Mall. 

At Crunch they make eating healthy a much more pleasant experience.  Though their food is healthy they don't cut corners when it comes to taste. They are also the only place in the food court that sells alcohol. :) Yall know I love me a good drink! 

I can't wait to see what they have in store for this week's Yelp event at the Filmore (Rock City). 

P.S.

The Mo' Chicken wrap is amazing."}
{"text":"A healthy and light alternative to the sauced chicken vendors and the pizza joint here in the South Park food court. Salad with four toppings was decent and filling and I left thinking that I had made a good choice.

One thing about this food court is the scenery. Lots of people very well dressed (or not well dressed, depending on how you look at it) and way too many teenagers primped for their friends. Was I ever like that? Don't answer that question."}
{"text":"IF you are seeking a healthier tasty alternative Crunch Bistro is pretty amazing. We drove from Waxhaw and I would definitely make the drive out again, it was that special! 

Breaking down their quinoa chicken bowl:

Quinoa:
IF you enjoy quinoa bowls (I know, you have had them 100 X, NOT this good you haven't) their actual \"quinoa\" is excellent!! SOO hearty but yet light, fluffy & airy AND moreover FULL OF FLAVOR! It has to be 1 of the BEST quinoa versions I have to date! It was so crazy good I m  craving it now! 

Chicken:
Their \"chicken quinoa bowl\" ...O M G, their well marinated moist grilled chicken is 
E X C E P T I O N A L !! The chicken spices are on point! How can a quinoa bowl be this GOOD, we were skeptical about how tasty this place would be before we arrived ...once we observed the chef in ACTION we knew we were DEAD wrong! Their priority is FRESH & FLAVORFUL and that's exactly what they delivered. 

Citrus lime dressing:
This is their MAGIC sauce that brings it ALL together ...request EXTRA as you will be glad you did. I LOVE their particular version as it's NOT overbearing, it allows the chicken & quinoa to continue to shine all the while it just compliments the dish. Perfect balance of citrus & lime!!

Dessert: Banana pudding w/ wafers & banana slices 
The chef was so cool he brought my husband & I 2 bowls of their super popular banana pudding on the house. That as well was delicious. 

Their \"Bianco pesto flatbread\" was GOOD but in all honesty we preferred their chicken quinoa bowl. 

Highly recommend! 

ENJOY"}
{"text":"I've had Crunch's wraps at a Yelp event last year but figured I needed to experience them on my own to give my own review.

This store is actually a stand at one end of the food court in South Park mall.  The menu is easy to read for people like me who often forget their glasses.  There are several salad options and wrap options and the opportunity to create your own.  

Ordering is at one end and then you pay for your order at the other end.  You can pick up your drink in the refrigerated case along the way. 

I ordered the greek isles salad and added salmon to it.  I have to say, this is one of the best salads I've had in a while and definitely the best salad I've ever had from a mall food court.  The only flaw is with the choice of lettuce.  This salad comes with iceberg lettuce which really has little nutritional value.  But oh well, the flavors of cukes, tomatoes, onions and dressing were great., maybe a little heavy on the dressing but it was still good.  The salmon was cooked perfectly as well and was a nice healthy addition to my salad.  It was $4 extra which Ior the size of it, I thought it was quite reasonable.

Price was, it was decent...Salad, salmon addition and designer water for $14."}
{"text":"Awesome lunch option inside the mall. I had the Waldorf  and it was very good. Greens are fresh and  dressing was  great. Hopefully they will open more locations soon."}
{"text":"A great healthy and cost-effective option! Their salads and wraps are delicious. My boyfriend and I had the buffalo bleu salad and crunch chicken wrap--both were fresh and absolutely delicious. Staff is friendly and prompt."}
