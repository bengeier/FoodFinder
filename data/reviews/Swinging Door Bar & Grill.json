{"text":"Very good!  Food was better than anticipated. The Might MAC burger ....CRISPY  Bacon.   Jambalaya  Pie... the right amount of spicy with crispy/chewy thin crust.  Definitely coming back.   AND great service...very attentive."}
{"text":"Good food. Went in for lunch in Saturday. Really slow but was day after Tribe winning streak ended. Good food selection with great September specials. Roast beef special was great along with burger. Minor complaint is ice tea not fresh brewed but food makes up for it. Will return!!"}
{"text":"Well I tried to order Uber eats from them and a courier couldn't come and pick it up in time so the suggestion from Uber eats was to try again in a few minutes so I did and re-ordered the same thing and was hoping that they didn't just let it sit in there to go box and get cold as I ordered it again and well they did. Everything is frozen cold and soggy. I will never order from here again"}
{"text":"this place is legit. cheap beer by the pitcher. great deals during games. neighborhood vibe. black velvet painting of a sexy lady above the beer taps. worst thing about this place is the touchtunes- like i ever need to hear \"you can't always get what you want\" or any song by \"the eagles\" ever again but whatever. pretty lousy vegetarian options but it's fun and cheap. drunk bros playing darts makes me nervous but that's my problem."}
{"text":"So this is based on dive Bar expectations, used to go to prior location for bar bowling debauchery. In any event, reason for the big score is the service was out of control good thanks Cierra, was prompt and constant with solid prices based on the big places this was great!  Pizza special was spicy at just the right level. So this was above normal dove bar for food and drinks... just missing that bar bowling machine"}
{"text":"Unbeknownst to me, this spot is owned by the same person who owns Suds McGuire's in Berea.  Bad news - my attempt to discover a cool new spot failed.  Good news - Crazy Tots.  Good pub grub, decent beer selection on tap.  Not many parking spots in back."}
{"text":"Great little dive bar. The crowd and the staff are nice, the drinks and food are reasonably priced. The bar food is actually quite good - the pizza especially. I personally am  a big fan of the crazy tots. Me and my fiance like to drop in to watch a game or hang out after we ran errands at the mall or grocery shops in the area.  If you guys could carry one or two single malt scotches, that would be a nice bonus."}
{"text":"I'm still a bit disappointed that the dive that was the original Swinging Door is gone, but I gotta admit this is a major step up in hygiene and overall food. What it lacks in gritty panache and perfect wings it makes up for in pretty damn good bar food, friendly bartenders and still great wings. The wings in the old spot were better, but it's nice to not have to go through the kitchen to get to the restroom anymore."}
{"text":"I have to preface this review with the fact that I love dive bars. It's on a small strip of businesses and there's a huge plaza down the street, so it doesn't appear Swinging Door gets the traffic it deserves. Zero problems my first visit. The food was super tasty, drinks were cheap, and it was a good vibe.   The seats at the bar were almost completely filled with a couple booths also taken up on a Wednesday night. Patrons were all middle-aged to older. Definitely seemed like some regulars. We had a group of about ten people in their 20s and 30s and pushed some tables together.  They were easily able to accommodate us. Two TVs were on behind the bar showing a baseball game but a few others were around the room and powered down. Touchtunes in the back of the place. A dart board was up front where some of our friends tried (and failed) to show off their skills.   Food was awesome and had a huge portion sizes. My wrap came on a baking tray accompanied with a mound of fries. They had a list of 12 beers on draft and even more in cans or bottles. The best part was that they have pitchers as an option for drafts! Really brings me back to college. They have a mini pitcher and a regular-sized pitcher. Incredibly cheap for domestic beer. $6 for a full pitcher of light beer and $4 when an Indians game is on.  I'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"Have gone there so many times but last two times had to leave because of parking. Dentist tows and Chinese place holds front spots until 9 pm. They need to figure out something soon."}
