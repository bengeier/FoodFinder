{"text":"Believe it or not, in my opinion there are not many good restaurants left for locals in Las Vegas. The market has been take over by bars that also serve food. Tuscany Grill is one of the few quality restaurants left for locals. The food is outstanding and the staff has bee the same for as long as I can remember - a testament to the owners."}
{"text":"Outstanding friendly like family! Service superb as well as the food and staff! Always recommend:)."}
{"text":"Tuscany Grill is the best Italian food in Vegas, bar none. Service is 5 stars, Food is 5 stars, and the Wine List is 5 stars... The best part of the place is the three owners, Jerry (the chef) , Mike, and Lou. They are always there walking around making sure you have everything you need, completing the Italian eatery experience. If you find yourself looking for great Italian food in Vegas look no further... Tuscany Grill is a must!"}
{"text":"My absolutely favorite! Hard to eat at any other Italian restaurant now! 
I highly recommend the shrimp in heavy cream sauce appetizer! Yum!!"}
{"text":"Had a great experience. Tried the special for tonight, Osso Bucco. Loved that dinner came with bread and your of choice of soup or salad. I enjoyed everything served. Will definitely be back again."}
{"text":"This is one of those places that never gets old. It's in very close proximity to where I live and whenever I go with the family we all have our favorites and it's never a let down. It's a very nice atmosphere, whenever I have gone there haven't been a ton of people in there and the ambience is nice and quiet. We've had great experiences with the servers there and you can tell they all work together as a team. From the bread (which yeah, it's just bread how good can it be: but with the olive oil and the vinegar topped with their special spices, it's delicious!) to the entrees there has never been a problem. My go to is the chicken picatta and most of the entrees come with a starter salad (I love the onion and tomato; it's very simple and just enough so that you aren't full when the meal comes) and the non-pasta dishes come with a side of penne pasta with marinara. Which is one of my favorite things as an Italian myself I always find it hard to not get a pasta dish at an Italian restaurant but with this I get to have my chicken and eat it too! Definitely a favorite for years and will continue to be in years to come."}
{"text":"Yelp thank you for introducing me to this place. I wasn't sure what to expect from this place but looks like this is the food trend on Eastern. Similar to Black Mountain Grill but focuses more on Italian food. Honestly, I feel that the price you pay to eat at Tuscany, the decor could be much better. I felt like I was in a Village Pub instead of some pricey Italian restaurant/bar or whatever you call it.  

Fresh bread. Check. Fresh salad. Check. Yes the prime rib was tender and almost melted in my mouth but my issue with it was that I'm not a fan of the au jus being poured all over the meat. I like to taste the meat before I dunk it in au jus sauce. Note to self, order au jus on side. But don't let me discourage you from ordering it, it was still A-Ok in my book.

Thanks for the experience Tuscany, and thank you for my complimentary Stella glass. Would I visit again? Maybe but for the price tag for what it is, rather go elsewhere or drive to Ellis Island for their prime rib."}
{"text":"Used to love this place as it was the same menu from the old Phillips Supper Club. Things have changed. I was looking for their famous Shrimp Scampi which I didn't see as an entree. Ordered something similar only to find it doused in same sauce as the artichoke francaise appetizer. In fact, everything was doused in that white sauce from my husband's fish, to my mom's fish (which was explained as halibut grilled within a lemon caper sauce. Not even close. The salad was nearly frozen, and the garlic bread was not what it used to be. Very disappointed as I've been a fan of the Tuscany for many years. Not sure what has happened."}
{"text":"Unfortunately for me, Tuscany Grill is a bit far away. However, whenever I'm in the Anthem area I make a point to stop by. Tuscany Grill has an \"Old Vegas\" ambiance and impeccable service to match. The food is classic Italian and cannot be beat for the price, I find the quality of Tuscany Grill's food to be better than most joints on The Strip. My favorites are artichoke hearts francaise, scampi in heavy cream, tortellini pascara and any of the veal dishes. The maitre d', Lou, is an colorful character filled with boundless kindness. Do yourself a favor, have a drink at the bar and listen to his stories."}
{"text":"Outstanding food, prime rib was the best ever. Buttery and melted in my mouth.
Spinach soup was excellent as well as the creamed spinach.
 Waiter staff on top of everything without being over bearing."}
{"text":"We had a drink at the bar before dinner and played a little video poker.  When I ordered a second drink the bartender informed me, in an extremely non-friendly manner, that I was not spending enough to get a free drink.  Um, I wasn't looking for anything for FREE.  That ruined my whole experience.  
There are literally hundreds of other places to go with better service."}
{"text":"Always a good atmosphere, and some good old school dining. And... Gluten free options, a definite try. The gluten free pasta was perfect."}
{"text":"Never a disappointment. The shrimp with heavy cream appetizer is a must have. So rich and delicious. I love this restaurant... Great service, excellent food, and a family feel. A lot of other restaurants could learn from this place. I'd give it 7 stars if I was allowed to."}
{"text":"I love Tuscany grill! It is defiantly a family favorite we attend Tuscany for birthdays and celebrations. We love the food and staff. I recommend Tuscany grill to others!"}
{"text":"Nice people, great food and my wife and I really enjoyed dinner. First time here tonight but not the last !! Great job guys."}
{"text":"Our favorite place for consistently good food.  Servers will make substitutions and treat you like you are being served!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is an elderly mecca!!!  

I mean, I love me some 55+, but, is this the official restaurant of Sun CIty Anthem? I'm pretty sure the crowd was older than Marie Calendars'.  That's saying something.

Anyway, moving on...

The food was actually pretty good.  I was really surprised.  I'd anticipated hating this spot considering it' pretty much just a sports bar.

I ordered the scallop special ($25) which came with 4 scallops, creamed spinach (other options were penne with marinara or baked potato), and a wedge salad.  The scallops were perfect and were covered in a great mushroom cream sauce. The creamed spinach was okay, (what's not to love about cheesy, creamy spinach??) but a little bland.  The wedge, also, a little boring, lacking bacon and blue cheese crumbles.

Others ordered the chicken piccata and I was a little shocked at the small portions.  For $19.95, they received tiny, tiny medallions of chicken.  It was definitely not worth the Strip prices despite the great taste.

Overall, good food but way too expensive for the portion size and atmosphere.  It's a sports bar for the elderly, but with fancier food.  You can find better Italian in Henderson for less."}
{"text":"ONLY bad thing is how can you be an Italian Restaurant without having Cannolis? Besides that perfect."}
{"text":"Stopped in on a Friday. It was early evening and the bar had only 3 other patrons. My boyfriend and I decided to sit at the bar and order some appetizers. We each put $20 in a machine. The bartender was putting away clean glasses. After 10 minutes she asked if we wanted a drink. She made the drinks and went over to the other side of the bar so quickly, I couldn't ask for menus.  She started talking to one patron and 20 minutes later we still had no menus, or any attention.  Just as I was ready to get up and walk around to her, she walked by.  I had to yell we would like menus.  She said I'll send the waitress and took off.  We each put another $20 in the machines. No refill of our drinks. The waitress was prompt, and greeted us with a huge smile. We ordered 2 appetizers to start.  The busboy was prompt and polite bringing our set ups and bar trays. Still no attention from the bartender. Food came and was wonderful. We had shrimp scampi and meatballs. Halfway through the food we finally got asked if we would like refills.  Waitress was great, food was great.  Female bartender the worst we have ever experienced. We were going to order more and stay longer.  We settled our tab and left. The bartender just kept talking to one lady. She would check on 1 other male patron. We did not exist in her world. One other gentleman came in and waited about 10 minutes for a drink. We left and went to another establishment to finish our evening. 
We will not be back!"}
{"text":"I really, really enjoy this place.  I live very close and have been several times - and never been disappointed.  The artichoke appetizer is very nicely done and the sauce is great to sop up with the warm bread they serve.  Caeser salad is always on point, nice and cold with just the right amount of dressing and the flavor is really great.  I seem to always gravitate toward the Chicken Parmesan which is more than enough to satisfy your craving with the portion size and served with choice of side.

Donna is always very welcoming and super nice.  I highly recommend this place if you're in the area and looking for a great spot for really good Italian."}
{"text":"This evening was my first visit to Tuscany Grill & it was quite a treat.  It has a cozy, comfortable family dining ambience but offers quality entrees.  The ambience is important to me in that I am a mom of a 5 year old so if its not comfy casual than its not a place I will visit frequently.  Tuscany Grill seems to be a nice fit, fine dining without the stuffy atmosphere & offers a children's menu, love that!  My girlfriend & I shared the Artichoke Heart Francaise as an appetizer, the portion size was very generous and tasted delicious.  I ordered the Blackened Shrimp & it was seasoned to perfection, had lots of flavor w/ a nice lil kick of heat and tasted absolutely wonderful, a must try!  I tasted my friend's lasagna and it was so bomb, another winner!!!  Service was on point, kudos to our waiter Kyle, very attentive & friendly."}
{"text":"Friendly service and really good Italian Food - there other kinds available - nice ambiance - great location."}
{"text":"Ok been driving by this place for the longest time and finally decided to give it a shot.
Has great review from my Yelp crew so I was up in the air as what to order ( the menu is big).
Since it is Italian, figured to go with the tradish...lasagna, meatball, chicken parm and baked penne.
Started with salad and an order of steam clams in the white sauce.
Kick butt from beginning to end! 
The service A+
The food A+
The price A+"}
{"text":"Best Blackened Prime Rib & Lobster in town!  Better than what I've had at Gordon Ramsey's Steak at far less price, utterly surprising in a local strip mall.  Great appetizers and service.  Offered my staff Christmas office dinner at top Las Vegas Strip restaurants, and every year they choose Tuscany Grill instead..,"}
{"text":"Tried the Tuscany for the first time this past weekend. Huge menu. Steaks, seafood and Italian. Big wine list. Staff was very friendly and the restaurant was very nicely decorated. Food was great. Looking forward to going back to try other menu items."}
{"text":"My husband and I ate at Tuscany Grill last night in the main dining room for dinner.  I have to say we did enjoy our dinner.  We had not been there for the last few years until now but use to go there 15 years ago quite often.  First, I will say what we did like.  The prices are very reasonable, however the seafood pastas are pricy.  We shared the Calamari app which was a large portion and cooked very well with a very good marinara sauce.  For our main courses we got the Sausage Cacciatore and the Chicken Angelo over pasta.  The portions are large and the food was very good.  We shared a bottle of wine (Pinor Noir) which was very reasonably priced and good quality.  My husband also got a glass of wine which was a very nice pour and very reasonably priced.

Now for the downside of the meal.  The bread is excellent crusty Italian bread.  For a restaurant that has been in business for years and one that has white tablecloths on tables in the dining room, I feel it is tacky that the butter for the bread comes in the little foil wraps and is hard pats of butter.  Also it seems every Italian restaurant serves the dipping oil and Tuscany does not.  

On Yelp it shows a pic of their Wedge salad.  It has bacon bits on top and sliced tomatoes and red onion on the side.  Tuscany gives a choice of 3 kinds of salad with their dinners, one is the Wedge.  My husband ordered the Wedge and his salad only had blue cheese dressing on it and that was it.  I mentioned the pic on Yelp to our waiter and he said, oh you can have bacon bits for a $1.00 and I forgot it showed tomatoes and onion so I didn't mention that.  That was never mentioned in advance.  My husband said not to bother with it.  I had their Caesar salad and their dressing is very good, but usually it would have some grated cheese on top but there was none.

Last issue was that since we both had pasta dishes we realized when we got home, we were never offered any grated cheese to put on our main pasta dishes.  The dining room was pretty crowded and our waiter was pretty attentive so I really don't know if Tuscany just does not offer it or if it was an oversight."}
{"text":"This is a nice but small Italian venue. The daily specials are the real deal. I went on Monday at the all-inclusive prime rib. It was done exactly as I wanted it the other items were equally as good and the service was excellent. Laura did a great job for us. I will be back on my next trip to Henderson."}
{"text":"You can NEVER go wrong with eating here. Just simply amazing food every single time. Been eating here for 20+ years and never recall having a bad meal. The service is always on point and the owners greeting is a nice touch! I recommend the chick parm!"}
{"text":"What a great staff! Got there 30 minutes before it closed and they found a way to accommodate me and serve me dinner. 
Very nice of them! I ordered the lasagna, it was really good!"}
{"text":"This place is pretty great! The prime rib is a good deal on Mondays. It comes with a shrimp cocktail appetizer, salad, prime rib with a side, and a slice of cheesecake. The cheesecake was amazing! I'm usually picky about cheesecake, especially plain cheesecake, but theirs was soooo good and they make it in house! 

I got a caesar salad and it was pretty good, it was a lighter, tangier caesar which I liked. The only thing is that I wish there were more croutons. But their dressings are also made there. 

Our service was fabulous. I never had an empty drink and our server Laura was very patient and knowledgeable about the menu."}
{"text":"I was brought here by some friends when I was visiting Las Vegas. This restaurant serves the BEST Veal Parmigana I have ever had (and I grew up in New York!). It surpasses anything  I've  had in Los Angeles too. The service was great and it had a very pleasant ambiance as well.
A year later and I'm still raving about the piping hot, crispy around the edges , tender in the middle Veal Parmigana!"}
{"text":"I am sad that this facility allows smoking on the patio. I wish that we would become more like CA. Smoke in your own domain."}
{"text":"Took my ex for his 50th Bday here, a friend went with us.  

The restaurant is beautiful, clean, the service was wonderful.   We never had an empty glass. The owner (co owner I believe) even came over to meet us at the end of the meal.

The food was spot on except for the ravioli which wasnt that good to me but my friend ordered the prime rib special which she loved and my ex ordered the veal parmasean (sp) which he loved.

Also had the cream of broc soup, amazing!   

The best parts were that they never rushed our meal, they were fine that we were there opening a million presents and the cheesecake which came with our friend's dinner was out of this world, we go to cheesecake factory for cheesecake, to hell with that!

Our friend even suggested just going back for cheesecake and coffee!

We will soon be dicing at this location.       Oh the antipasto and other appetizers were amazing too by the way, I cant wait to try something else, like the lasagna?     :)     Overall, thanks for such a wonderful experience!"}
{"text":"Great dinner! Had the Monday special prime rib dinner. Comes with shrimp cocktail, salad or soup, prime rib and finished off with cheesecake. Everything was fantastic and cooked perfectly. The service was super fast and the food quality was awesome. Very nice atmosphere. They have an outdoor patio which the weather right now is perfect for.

Be sure to make a reservation. But if you have to wait, it is certainly worth the wait."}
{"text":"I think the place (Tuscany) is largely overrated. The food quality is fair, and / or decent. The service is respectable, but it better be at those prices. However, the service is nothing to write home about. 

The positioning of this restaurant appears to put an \"image\" in the mind of patrons / guests that it \"must be good\" since it is located in an affluent area. The exterior is marginally pleasing to the eye, and the interior could use some improvements (lighting, choice of music, staff presence and attitude upon welcoming, etc.)

I have found the staff to be fairly pleasant, but the same cannot be said for the management team - in the least. Instead of a \"welcoming\" feeling, it seems as though guests are \"expected\" to praise this place simply upon entering. The interior is pleasant (I guess), but not short of its flaws either. 

Simply put, there are nearly twenty (20) Italian restaurants / dining establishments  that I would choose before even thinking about visiting \"Tuscany\". Simply put....The place is truly overpriced and vastly overrated."}
{"text":"We had a really nice experience here tonight. The service was great, really friendly.  There were so many options on the menu, and dinner was very good!  The menu was so varied and good I actually asked the waiter, after much discussion, to surprise me. He did so with veal osco busco, nice call!"}
{"text":"Great romantic little place to eat for a fast steak. My husband likes great steak so we are always looking for a place that has a good steak for a good price. I like to have a great wine with my steak they have a good selection. Make sure you see Kyle he is an amazing sever with great suggestions."}
{"text":"This place is convenient to our house and my husband and I finally tried it.  The service was great, very attentive and our water glasses filled often.  My husband really liked his soup, pasta fazool.  Unfortunately we were quite disappointed in the entrees.  Spaghetti was over cooked and mushy, far from al dente.  The meatballs lacked flavor.  My husband's sausage was better.  Overall, not horrible but had hoped for better."}
{"text":"Had a wonderful dinner here tonight.  We both had a glass of wine. $7/glass that was fantastic! My bf had the Prime Rib special which had an awesome shrimp cocktail, soup or salad, prime rib & side AND cheesecake for $20! I had blackened salmon with lemon butter sauce (my favorite thing here). I'd definitely go back and highly recommend it. Service was stellar as well. The entire restaurant and restroom were very clean.  I'll definitely be back.... a lot!"}
{"text":"We heard about this restaurant from a neighbor and, boy, are we thankful! The food was absolute perfection and the service was above and beyond! We had salmon, prime rib, pepper New York steak and veal scallopini. Each entree (and we were all so impressed that we shared bites) was excellent.  Even the bread was deliciously crusty and light. The cheesecake was smooth and creamy. HIGHLY recommend."}
{"text":"Had a quick dinner here and I have to say the food was very good. Service was great and the atmosphere was pleasant. Nice neighborhood Italian restaurant"}
{"text":"AMAZING food and service! Definitely a new favorite od mine!!"}
{"text":"Very good Italian food, prices a little high for off strip local Italian Restaurant $30 for Veal, $20 for Spaghetti, meal comes with salad,  entrees were very good, service was excellent, Very comfortable venue for casual dinner. This was my 4th time back and will go back on next trip to Las Vegas"}
{"text":"Went to Tuscany last night and sat at the bar to eat as we did not make a reservation and wanted to play a little. We ordered drinks and asked if we could order dinner. Female bartender there said someone would be with us shortly. After ignoring us and making sure the people she knew had drinks and were eating we tried to get her attention but she just ignored us. We waited 45 minutes and put $60 in the machines. This is not the first time she has totally ignored us but it will be the last. Great food if you can get waited on !!"}
{"text":"I have been to Tuscany 100 times over the last 10+ years and I love it.  The service is always really good, the food is great, and I like the kick back atmosphere!  I usually get the Chicken Parm or the Tortellini Pascara depending on my mood and both are always great.  Go on a Friday night when they have creamed spinach for the veggie of the day.  It is the best creamed spinach I've had anywhere!"}
{"text":"First time here. The tomato onion salad is fantastic! Their homemade balsamic dressing is amazing. 

Our busboy, Ian, was super friendly and on his game. He deserves a 5 star rating! Our server, Cherrie, was pleasant and nice as well. 

I gave 4 stars based on our seating arrangement and lack of cocktail menu, just a pet peeve of mine. I prefer to not have to ask the server exactly what type of liquors, etc. Just seems modern day to provide some specialty handcrafted libations. 
They seated us in a booth that the top of our knees were jammed in. Yes, we are tall, but the booths are definitely short. This place is certainly ready for a renovation."}
{"text":"Great food, reasonable priced, friendly staff! Glad we tried it. Everything from the appetizer to dessert was nice. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Courtesy of AT&T and or Blackberry, my frozen phone would not allow me to photograph my meal at Tuscany Grill.. Oh well, words will just have to do..

After reading fantastic reviews about Tuscany Grill and since I live in the area, a decision to give this place a whirl was made. 

The set up is your standard, bar on one side, restaurant on the other with a host-stand in between.  The lighting is dim and combined with an option for a booth this could be a great place to take a date.

Perhaps I have not dined here repeatedly to receive that \"Cheers\" type greeting I've heard so much about, but all in all the service was slightly above Vegas's standard, mediocre.  A few cheesy jokes warmed up our waiter and it was smooth sailing the rest of our meal.

Cocktails were strong, bread was warm, mozzarella and tomatoes were fresh, and my chicken picatta was delightful.  

Would I categorize this meal as award winning, not really but would I eat here again, sure if my first two picks happened to be crowded. I just felt that for the price, just about $20 per entree (non-meats/seafood), you could get a very similar dish down the street (Black Mtn. Grill or Gaetanos) for less.  Price isn't everything, I know, but if service isn't above average and the ambiance is about the same, why pay more?"}
{"text":"One of my favorite Italian restaurants in Vegas. I've gone to Tuscany Grill for years... even since they were at their original location on Sunset. The food is really good, but the service is what makes them exceptional. Lou, the owner, is the nicest guy and gives the place a real family feel. The waiters are really friendly and provide great service.

The atmosphere makes it great for a date or family dinner, but if you are into sports there is a nice sports bar with video poker."}
{"text":"Update May 24, 2017:
We've been here a few more times since this review - and every time has been as fantastic as the last.  Prime rib Mondays CANNOT be beat. This place is a gem in Anthem. We've had Lora as our server a few times - she is so sweet and so friendly - this place feels like \"home\". Check it out - you won't be sorry.

This was our second time here - just as good the second time as the first.  Monday night is prime rib night, and it's SOOOO good - you can cut it with your fork. Along with the prime rib, you get a shrimp cocktail, salad (or soup), baked potato and a slice of cheesecake.  Excellent value, and excellent food. The wait staff is always very pleasant, and on top of everything. They work very hard but still always have a smile on their faces.  It seems that this is a regular hangout for a lot of people - the waiter seemed to know some of the other patrons There's a special pretty much every night (check the website)."}
{"text":"Awesome restaurant the food is great! Not only do they have good Italian food they also have very very good seafoods and steaks. I would recommend this place to anyone. They have a huge menu and a variety of different foods."}
{"text":"Best pasta fugoli ever!!! This place is a Las Vegas iconic landmark. Sherry is the best person and waitress you will ever meet. Please try this place out you will be glad you did."}
{"text":"The best veal parmigian in Vegas!!! Trout is to die for!!! Bananas foster a must!!!
Wait staff is always so attentive...our favorite is John.  Almost a weekly spot for us!"}
{"text":"YUM!  Had friends in town that wanted steak and we didn't want to drive all over looking for a great place.  Tuscany Grill is just down the street so we thought we'd give it shot!  I'm so happy we did. The service was exquisite, the food delicious and the surroundings were tasteful and classy.  The music was perfect, too!  I had the fried shrimp, which was done to perfection as was the prime rib my friend ordered.  Cocktails were top notch as well.  If you're looking for a great place to eat that's near Sun City Anthem, this is the place.  Look no further, Tuscany Grill is the place to go!"}
{"text":"Food was good but service left something to be desired. My husband, daughter and I had dinner tonight and the restaurant did not seem to be too busy. We were seated and our waitress took a long time to come to our table and greet us. She seemed to be hanging out at the bar chit-chatting with other customers. We had to have a bus-boy flag her down for us. She did not check on us once during our meal. We again had to flag other waiters and bus boys to get us re-fills on our drinks. We waited around for our check and after waiving her down to give us our check, she smiled politely, acknowledged that we had a child with us and walked away. We are new to Henderson and I have to say that I would not recommend this place due to the service. Food was good but surely something you could order at another restaurant with good service, if this is important to you. 

Thanks to the waiter that boxed our to-go portion of our meal even though we were not your table."}
{"text":"We dined here as a family & enjoyed our meal.  My chicken piccata was not the best I've ever had, but the artichoke appetizer was the very best ever!  My husband said their Marinara sauce was the best he had ever eaten.  The service was excellent if not a little slow."}
{"text":"Friday and Saturday they have a Halibut plate which is fantastic. Other italian food if very good"}
{"text":"Authentic Italian food that you will end up craving again hours later. Friendly bar that gives you that Cheers \"where everyone knows your name\" type feeling. Try the Chicken Angelo"}
{"text":"Had one last gift card so had to come back - this time the presentation of the food was very disappointing and overall the whole experience was just fair. Service was good . If you are older (  65+) and like an older crowd than this might be your place but we won't be coming back as we can spend $100 on a better meal in a livelier environment"}
{"text":"My husbands family and I ate there for the 1st time last night  (for my husband and I). I have to say, the food was amazing. I've been craving steak since I found out I was pregnant but no place (outside of an actual steak house) has done it for me but their New York peppered steak was amazing. My husband ordered their chicken fettuccine Alfredo and he is very picky about his Alfredo, he finished his entire dish. The service was on par with no complaints. Why the 4 stars then? The garlic bread. It was probably the worst garlic bread I have ever had. Tasted more like over cooked not quite burnt cheese then garlic. We will definitely be back just without ordering the garlic bread."}
{"text":"This place is very outdated and overpriced for the quality of food. It smells like an old blueberry hill or some sort of old buffet chain. I should smell food, not how old the building is. Its geared torwards the elderly, or so I assume. Everyone that works there is old except a few. Most of the guests were older as well.  Not a young soul as far as I could tell. 
Its contradictory too, is it a sports bar or a nice italian restaurant? You can't have both,  its just weird. 
Now the food and service... 
The bread is simply store bought bland loaf but it's free so whatever. Still kind of looks bad. Through our entire meal the server kept asking if we wanted more bread. We kept saying no. Even after our meals she asked for the 6th time. No means no!! Stop pushing it. 
The salads were nothing special. Bland and swimming in dressing. 
Appetizer was the artichoke hearts which definitely came from a can. They were sooooo soggy and tasteless. 
I ordered a pasta in creamy tomato sauce. It was good but nothing spectacular. It was $12 so no complaints. My husband got the filet mignon medium with spinach on the side.  His filet was super rare and unseasoned.  Tasted like a roast. Not good.  And the spinach was disgusting! We both spit it out. It seriously tasted like I licked a horse. Yes a horse. Sooooo bad. 
I usually order dessert but I just couldn't. I wanted to leave. $60 for a bad experience. Olive garden is way better in my opinion."}
{"text":"Was looking for Italian food for my birthday dinner and came upon this place. I was worried about some of the negative reviews but was pleasantly surprised. I had chicken penne Alfredo. The pasta was cooked perfectly and the sauce was clearly homemade. Just what I was looking for. My Italian dressing was so delicious. But the star of the show was the cheesecake. It was unlike any other cheesecake I've ever had. It was so creamy and delicious. Not too sweet and the perfect texture. Everyone at our table was very satisfied with their food. I highly recommend."}
{"text":"The service was excellent!  Our water glasses were never more than half empty, our food was brought out quickly and empty dishes were quickly cleared.  Our waitress was VERY friendly and welcoming and we were checked on often (but not too much to be annoying).  The food was wonderful with a good menu selection.  Overall, a great experience!"}
{"text":"Tuscany Grill was a breath of fresh air. I picked up my girls (Girlfriend and daughter) at dance class tonight and we decided to try out Tuscany Grill. We entered the restaurant to find a busy dining room filled with cloth tables and people drinking wine with their dinner. It reminded me of a scene out of The Sopranos. We were seated and Perry was our server. 

   My daughter got the Ravioli and my gf ordered the Penne Alfredo with shrimp. I ordered the Chicken Cacciatori. Perry asked if we wanted my daughters dinner to come out first ( She is 3) and that impressed me that he understood how important it is to get your child eating before she gets too impatient. 

    Tuscany Grill has the right model. There is a service assistant that stands at the back of the dining room looking at the tables and anticipating their guests needs. The result is prompt refills, and cleared plates at every stage of the dining experience. With all of the crap service at restaurants these days,  it is very nice to see a restaurant that actually anticipates the guests needs. 

     Perry did a great job by checking back at least three times to make sure we had what we needed. I haven't even got to the food, which was hot and very flavor filled. 

    You have 3 new customers Tuscany Grill. We will be back many more times."}
{"text":"Best place in Las Vegas. Have always had a positive experience. My favorite dinner is the prime rib and shrimp cocktail. Great food, great service, great quality. Ive been a customer for years and will continue to be for many more."}
{"text":"There new Monday prime rib special is unbeatable.  I stopped going for awhile and use to get the king size  blackened prime rib.  The meat quality was just ok. But I have gone the last two Monday and the quality is back to melt in your mouth meat. Very tender and the owner is very friendly and commitment to providing great service and a great meal. My favorite is the prime rib but I also really enjoy there fish entrees as well. I wish they would still be open for lunch though. Definitely a regular place to go that doesn't disappoint."}
{"text":"Have driven by this place every day for years and thought I'd give it a try...  Sat at the bar and had a glass of wine and ordered the Chicken Parm.  Sadly, it was just 'ok'.  TV dinner quality.  Don't think I'll be back.  There are MUCH better Italian restaurants within a mile of this place."}
{"text":"Not bad! Had the prime rib and it was good. Had great service from Lora F! It was our first time and we got free cheese cake! By far the best cheese cake ever!! They should be making nothing but cheese cake!"}
{"text":"Hands down the best spot in town. Our go to spot for dinner out in the neighborhood.
Recommend any of their fresh fish dishes and veal parm is not to be missed!!!!"}
{"text":"Took forever for our food to arrive.   Penne that came with my meal was absolutely horrible.   A jar of  Ragu would have tasted better.  Very generous portions. Having grown up with authentic  Italian food -this wasn't even close. A big disappointment."}
{"text":"Food is bland and when commenting to waiter about food his response is, \"yeah that's what you get when you order noodles with vegetables\". I ordered the penne pasta, straight from menu, i did not change or alter the dish. I'm sorry this is not a four star restaurant."}
{"text":"We really enjoyed our dinner at Tuscany Grill. The restaurant is nicely decorated and  noticeably clean (even the light fixture above our booth was immaculate!) I had the Chicken Marsala and asked for my pasta to have the marsala sauce on it (instead of marinara sauce) and they happily accomodated my request and it was excellent. My husband had the Seafood Fradiavlo and he said it was excellent (a rarity for him!)  He commented on the ample amount of seafood in it especially lobster. We also had a cup of pasta fagioli soup which was excellent. The cheesecake was excellent too. It came with whipped cream and a delicious raspberry sauce. Yum! Our server was really nice and very welcoming. The young man who brought us bread and kept coming back to refill my water was awesome. He happily refilled my water at least 4 times. They have a very appealing menu and look forward to returning to try more on the menu."}
{"text":"Went here once, had some kind of chicken that I think was frozen, not fresh. The sauce tasted like something out of a can I think, it was definitely not home made. Will not return..."}
{"text":"Great Service all the time - ask for Sherry - she is the best.  Food is always good.  Soup is to die for.  Everything comes out hot and taste great.  Great hold in the wall.  Try it you would be sorry."}
{"text":"not one thing negative to say. have been going to tuscany for a couple years now & have not had one bad experience. great food, environment, & staff."}
{"text":"A little old school flair in one of the fastest growing communities in the country, Tuscany is a throwback to when dining out was truly special...fancy table cloths, dimly lit dining room...a special feeling...a real \"date night\" joint.

We go every time we are in town, as the food is very good and it is a place we all know everyone likes and that won't destroy the bank.

In the past, I had gotten the linguine with white clam sauce, as it is an Italian joint fave and something I was sure they did well...i have also gotten the Francaise and the sausage and pepper pasta, both were delicious.  This time, however, I went with the linguine and red clam sauce...and it was good!  Just like all of my east coast Italian memories.

Syd is crazy for the pasta fagiole, LeeAnn loves the chicken Marsala, my in-laws love the baked penne, though Bob can be convinced to eat the steak.

All in all, it is a nice dining experience...every time."}
{"text":"Couldn't have picked a better place for Valentine's Day.  Escargot yum! 12 ounce lobster tail melted in your mouth and veal osso buco  delicious. You also get soup or salad, a plus. What also made it 5 stars was the service.  Server John A  was amazing and so was the staff."}
{"text":"Went back and visited this restaurant again. Sometimes the second visit is not as good as the first. This visit was BETTER!

The food is served by a great staff, the presentation is amazing.  The food was delicious. The \"Sunday Gravy\" is amazing. As a New York Italian who had grandma's sauce on Sundays , this meal brought back fond memories!!  You have to vist this place."}
{"text":"Great food, including the bread.  A little dark inside but some might call that romantic!  Service can be slow at times, but otherwise a nice place."}
{"text":"Celebrating our 11th reunion. Have been inseparable ever since. Waited 11 months to make it legal and get married. We chose your restaurant because of the ambiance, great quality of food, exceptional service and how special you make us feel. Thank you for making our special day unforgettable."}
{"text":"This restaurant is a good place to get your Italian fix. I always judge Italian restaurants by their lasagna so, of course, I had the lasagna and it was really good!

The service was good and all of the different dishes we enjoyed were tasty.

We will definitely go back when we get the Italiano urge!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is a haul across town for me but it is so worth it! We've been coming here for years, everyone that works here is super friendly, the chef comes out when he can and the food is SO fresh and delicious. Go give it a try."}
{"text":"I was surprised to see so many high reviews here.  For the price, this place had nothing special about it in my opinion.  It has the feel of a chain restaurant, with upholstered booths around the outside and square tables in the center.  Nice enough, but nothing imaginative.  I saw a tempting looking main course with a combination of scallops and abalone that I think was about $24, but I ended up ordering the scallop dinner that was a special that night which, for some reason, ended up costing $28.  It consisted of four scallops in sauce that was nothing special.  Yes, they were large and tender (thank goodness!), but... really, $7 each?!  For my side dish I opted for rice pilaf which was a mistake.  It looked just like something I could have ordered at Denny's.  My husband's meal wasn't any more exciting.  I would say we won't be going back, except...

I was sad when we presented them with our $100 gift certificate and rather than give us $20 cash back in change (or let us take any tip out of it), they brought us a $20 gift certificate.  Really?  He said it was policy.  I think it was bad karma on their part.  They shouldn't have to resort to that kind of arm-twisting to get people to come back.  We will be going back with a plan to spend as close to $20 as possible, which probably means dessert, then never again. There are too many other good choices out there."}
{"text":"We had food catered at our salon, and let me tell you, it was AMAZING!! The pasta was made to perfection and the flavor was out of this world! We also had salad and the dressing was Italian I believe. He made it fresh and you could taste it! It was heavenly! And the salad had artichoke hearts and usually I don't like them because they are never right(?) but his were mouth watering. 
I'll just say hands down the food was impeccable."}
{"text":"This place is our favorite! Steaks, seafood pasta and drinks, Everything here is FIVE STAR! The service here is unmatched!"}
{"text":"Tuscany is an excellent Italian restaurant that features traditional dishes such as pasta fagioli, veal marsala, cheese tortellini, and chicken piccata. Everything I've had is great, although I prefer the penne pasta with broccoli and pine nuts; marvelous flavor with just a kick of spice. The bananas foster dessert is made table-side and is to die for. Highly recommend!! 

What I also like about this restaurant, that you'll find in many places across the city, is the bar with gaming if you so choose. It's not invasive and you never smell smoke in the dining room, if they even allow it."}
{"text":"amazing we got lunch catered at the salon and everyone even our guest loved it!!!!!! the food it was hot on time and tasted amazing the homemade italian dressing, tortellini delicious we all highly recommend this restaurant! we will be using them for our company christmas party!



everyone loved the food for our christmas party  it was delicious generous portions and affordable i recommend them for catering too!!"}
{"text":"We have been dining at Tuscany Grill for many years.  The food is exceptional and the service is over the top.  I like Lawry's Prime Rib and theirs is equally good.  I like Ruth's Chris Filet and theirs is equally good.  And for Italian food, don't look any farther.  And their prices are where they should be.  We eat there as often as we can.

{"text":"We were recently in Henderson staying at the Green Valley Ranch Resort.  We decided to go to dinner outside of the hotel and did a Yelp search.  We found the Tuscany Grill with 4 STARS!  This restaurant was easy to find. When we walked in the door, we were not greeted. After standing to the side, our presence was finally acknowledged and we were seated quickly.  The decor is a little dated but that doesn't bother us, it is really just about the food!  Our table cloth was dirty and stained they might do well to use the butcher block paper many other italian restaurants use (just a suggestion).  This is authentic Italian.  There were many different pasta dishes to choose from.  After we placed our order, we were brought some fantastic bread followed by a salad drowned in dressing that was not impressive.  The entrees arrived shortly after the salads and they were ok. The food was kind of bland, not enough garlic and nothing out of the ordinary.  It wasn't bad but I have had much better..."}
{"text":"Continues to be really good and everyone who works there is very personable.  This is definitely 'old school' Italian."}
{"text":"Just ok...thought the food could have been better based on the reviews!"}
{"text":"First time and we really enjoyed it. Superior staff and excellent food. We are local and can't believe we've been missing out on this local gem. Met Mike one of the owners and what a wonderful guy. Staff were the best.  We are coking back!!!"}
{"text":"I had the pleasure of being treated to Tuscany Grill's catering at work! Super fresh ingredients and I appreciated vegetarian/vegan options."}
{"text":"We have not been here for a long time and decided to try it for my son in laws birthday as a personal friend of mine said he personally knew the owners really well.  I called and made a reservation and the table was ready for us when we arrived.  Our reservation was for 8 people but only 6 showed which I think threw the waiter off at the beginning.  

We were seated and sat for some time before someone came and offered us drinks.  My wife does not like regular water and ordered two large bottles of water.   Now they charge almost $5 per bottle, the busboy filled all the glasses brought bread and then we sat and waited and waited and waited and waited.  Finally I had to flag down a busboy and ask him to let our waiter know the other 2 were not coming and we were ready to order.  He said he would take care of it, removed 2 menus from the table and proceeded to take the rest of the stuff from those 2 seats.  He picked up one glass he had just filled up earlier and turned it over dumping all the water in the full glass all over the table.  He felt bad and I don't understand how he could not see or feel the glass full, but he never offered to replace the water from the bottle we were being charged for.

Finally the waiter came over and took our order, someone brought out the salads and soup, we asked for more bread, he said ok and it never came.  Just as we were done with this course the guy who dumped the water all over the table came by and asked if we wanted more bread, took two baskets and came back with one.

The food was good, some portions matched the price and some did not.  I had the prime rib which was $30, it was 18oz's and pretty good however the vegetables we a very small portion.  My daughter ordered a chicken dish for $20 and it was not worth the price and the amount of pasta they gave her, really???  Pasta is a cheap food and for the amount of chicken they gave her, there should have been more.

Overall the service was not that great.  I watched other tables getting more attention then ours which was a little frustrating since for the price you pay, everyone should receive the best service.  Above and beyond that, for someone personally knowing the owners, I would think they would try a little harder to give a better impression.  Then dessert time, everyone ordered dessert except me, I got coffee..my wife ordered coffee and dessert and it never came.

For 6 people our bill came to over $220 which for the food which was ok, portions could have been better, the service could have been way better, the water we paid for which was dumped on the table by the staff not us, should have been offered to have been replaced, I must say, I can find better quality food in this town off the strip for less money with better service.  We probably will not go back to this place again as the value should have been better and when I am paying for water, if you spill it, you should replace it or not charge me for it.  Overall, I was disappointed."}
{"text":"Great food, great service. Would definitely recommend to anyone. Home made cheesecake is delicious. Veal parmesan was great & the haddock also delicious."}
{"text":"First time eating here and it won't be our last food was amazing our server Lora was on point very nice and was on top of it."}
{"text":"Food was good, service was very attentive and pricing is fair.  A basic menu with a nice atmosphere."}
{"text":"The food was good. The order was messed up. Once the waiter heard the order was messed up, we never saw him again. He didn't even try to make it right. No one came over to apologize,  my 89 year old mom sat there with no food until they fixed it. Service was awful and I will no longer go there. Too bad. It could have been fixed. Just say you are sorry. Get it together, service means everything. You just lost a lot of business. You have no idea. Gaetano,  here we come. Sorry we left. Best Italian food and service in Henderson"}
{"text":"I could never in a million years find the appropriate words to describe Tuscany.  I love the owners, the staff and the food is overwhelmingly divine.  A wonderful dining experience all around."}
{"text":"This place is my favorite for two reasons. My husband and I love enjoying date nights there. We usually sit at the bar. From seafoood to pasta everything's delicious. The second reason I love this place is their catering. Recently had the tortellini catered and it was to die for. Salad and dressing also fresh and delicious. Already looking forward to our next catering experience!"}
{"text":"Consistently good food and service. Try the chicken special on Thur. This should be on the menu every night"}
{"text":"I I went here on a friend's recommendation. She used to go every week with her parents. Nothing too bad about this place a bit out of date + 90 percent of the diners on Wednesday night at 7 p.m. were over 60 and obvious regulars. Service was good and there are indeed wait staff checking on you all the time. On May 3rd water glass refill I was asked if I would like a larger glass which was promptly provided. I had the lasagna and while reviews are always relative I found it unremarkable and no better than a frozen lasagna from Costco. I understand that the chef need to put out an item that a vast audience will enjoy, but I found it Bland and uninteresting. The red blend wine that my server suggested a house wine was actually pretty good and at $7 a glass reasonably priced. The high point of the evening was the cheesecake. The cheesecake was wonderful and if I do return it will simply be for dessert. Along with some limoncello it ended a mediocre meal on a high note. I don't think I will be a regular here as I enjoy more of a flare in meals that are going to leave me with a $60 tab."}
{"text":"Full disclosure: I hosted a number of dinners at this restaurant, so I'm rather friendly with the owners and staff. That said, diners can choose from a number of Italian restaurants in the area. Tuscany Grill offers great value and a diverse menu to appeal to just about anyone. The bar area has a sports feel as well as gaming machines. But I go there for the meal and a drink. Strongly recommended. Great bunch of guys and gals!"}
{"text":"I  Likey!!!

Parking - Vegas, come on,  you park in front of course!

Wait - Friday night at 6:00 pm with no reservations - No problem and quickly seated. Unfortunately next to the loud real estate guy and his entourage of loud assistants.

Service - Samantha was fantastic.  The folks serving were great.  Maitre'd was awesome. Overall, a nice and casual experience.

Food - Had the Filet.  As good as anywhere. Wifey had the roast beef. I normally stay away from this and I really liked it as well!

Price - Reasonable.  Three drinks, dinner under 100.00 for high quality food.

My stomach says - Dudes and Dudettes, what are you waiting for. No worry about the suburban-esque features of this restaurant!  it is a great place and I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Still the best prime rib I have ever had....... ate at The Golden Steer last night and had their prime rib...... it lacked seasoning and was not as tender as Tuscany grill. Can't wait to get back next month for a special occasion..... I LOVE PRIME RIB!!!"}
{"text":"Italian food is my favorite kind of food, so needless to say, I've got to a ton of restaurants over the years. But through it all, in the Vegas Valley, none of them top Tuscany Grill. I've been going here for years, and I'll likely never stop going if they keep it up like this.

The food here is top notch. The chefs make the finest Italian cuisine available in the valley. I don't think I've honestly had a dish here I didn't enjoy. The staff/chefs/etc. also don't seem to have a problem taking simple requests (for instance, they have tortellini pasta in a spicy pascara sauce, but they had no problem whipping up a batch for me with alfredo sauce instead.)

The atmosphere is as solid as the food. It has the appearance of a high-class restaurant, but is still welcoming for guests of all ages and walks of life. All of the servers/chefs/etc. are great people and treat you well. Even if straight-up dining isn't what you're looking for, the restaurant does have a bar section with numerous sporting events on the television sets. 

I notice on some other review sites, the restaurant has come under fire for what are supposedly \"high prices.\" This is a nice restaurant, not a loud, raucous atmosphere where you come with friends for cheap food. You will pay a pretty penny, but I assure that 

A) The food you have here will be some of the best Italian food you have ever eaten, and 

B) There are other far more expensive Italian restaurants around town, and their items aren't nearly this good.

You get what you pay for. Period. And perhaps nowhere is that better reflected here.

If I have one complaint about the restaurant, it is the somewhat inconsistent, hit-and-miss soup selection. Every night the restaurant has its pasta fagioli and a \"soup of the day.\" The fagioli isn't terrible, but is nothing worth writing home about, and I really wish they had chosen something better as the \"everyday soup.\" The soups of the day are sometimes excellent, but other times are not the sort of thing your typical diner will enjoy. I really wish the restaurant had a set schedule for what soup would be had on what night.

All in all though, the good by far outweighs the bad. This is a restaurant that deserve the full 5 stars - and this reviewer's highest recommendation.

{"text":"Never go here! It was bland & flavorless. Not only was the entree bad the salad was even worse! A couple pieces of sad lettuce & a slice of tomato. I've never in my life returned an entree cause I did not like it, but in this case I ordered Linguine and clams in a white sauce. It was bad, so bad. It had no flavor, the sauce was just pasta water and the clams totally came out of a can. My husband's lasagna might has well been tomato soup with some noodles. Don't waste your time and money. That's an hour of my life I wish I could get back."}
{"text":"This is one of those restaurants that takes you to another world. A welcoming elegant ambiance and incredibly friendly servers giving it a nice feel good vibe. Everything we ordered was heavenly. For appetizers we got the baked mozzarella, and the shrimp scampi in garlic sauce. Both were outstanding. Used the addicting scampi sauce to dip the wonderful warm bread (three baskets, couldn't help it!) Our entrees were chicken francaise and angel hair pomodoro which were deliciously made to perfection. They happily brought more bread and filled our water without us having to ask. Great service, great place!"}
{"text":"Had the company Xmas party here last week. Even though it was chilly all 11 of us dined on patio. Plenty of heaters so no one was cold. Donna was our server and as always did a phoneminal job of keeping our glasses and plates full. She must have served 100 people that eve she didn't miss anything. Everyone's meals all came out the same time and were perfect. Lou, Mike, Donna and the rest of the staff make us feel like family and we were glad we chose Tuscany for our dinner!"}
{"text":"Been going to this restaurant for a couple years now and amazed at the consistency of how good the food is!  The sauce is wonderful! Never disappointed! Exceptional service! Cannot say enough about this place and my husband agrees and he is the fussiest person ever!"}
{"text":"Lovely place. Friendly staff and food is on point. Had the spaghetti and meat ball and was pleasantly surprised with the quality. Definitely recommend this place and will be coming back"}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised by the high quality of food, great service, and reasonable prices. Everything we had was great. Also the meals come with a salad which is a real surprise. Just a heads up though if you order the linguini and clams they are not fresh clams. They are canned clams. Still not too bad as far as taste goes. I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Dined here with husband and son.  One slice of mozzarella appetizer was tasty but thin for $8.  The fettuccine alfredo tasted good but I was shocked to see that for an additional $7, they only give you 3 pieces of shrimp in the whole entree.  It is nice and quiet but overpriced in my opinion. What's funny too was how they served our Coke in a Coors Light bar glass with the dinner.  Otherwise, service was okay, the waiter did not even introduce himself.  I will, however, give them a compliment for having a children's menu that does not have macaroni and cheese, hamburger, or other greasy/fried foods but instead, real entrees to choose from."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, great employees, great food, great everything! 

The fact i live around the corner is awesome, I'll definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"Wonderful date night meal with the hubs! Everything is fresh and delicious ! Great service as well ."}
{"text":"Tuscany Grill is par excellent!  There are many many choices - good old linguini and lasagna, which are both fantastic, but do try the eggplant-it's to die for!"}
{"text":"Tuscany Grill is the place we have come for family celebrations since they opened at their Eastern location a few years ago.  The food is always consistently good, and the serving staff is wonderful, especially Sherry.  Ask for their specials, and if it is Saturday, get the creamed spinach.  Anything Francaise be it chicken, shrimp or halibut is fabulous."}
{"text":"Great neighborhood restaurant. Great Italian food and great/friendly service from every staff member. We shared a couple dishes that were great: Pesto pasta, a chicken dish, pasta & clams - all hit the spot - great value. 

Stopping in for dinner with a person, couple or group works or you can stop in the bar where they make generous drink and have 5 TV's to watch games."}
{"text":"Very good.  Not exceptional but very reliable and good sized portions.  Staff is very friendly and service is timely.  I have gone several times and wouldn't hesitate to return again."}
{"text":"They can't cook a steak. At all. Failure. Asked for a medium rare and they gave me a medium borderline medium well -BARELY any pink- I sent it back and they sent back a poorly and unevenly cooked rare. 

Add to that the terrible customer service - the owner has lied to my face multiple times and I can't discourage anyone from coming here more.

Also there were cockroaches in the restaurant."}
{"text":"One word: Scalone.

I had the scallop/abalone dish they call Scalone. I wasn't sure what to think when it came out; I think I was expecting to see small slices of the two tender shellfish arranged on the plate. What I was served were croquets, in a fashion, of the pounded abalone with scallop meat layered on top, served in three sizable yet thin filets put together with a light breading then sauteed in a rich (but not heavy) lemon butter sauce. Really delicious. The toasted almond garnish gave it a smoky, nutty depth that really pulled it together.

My dining companions had the baked ziti and the eggplant parmesan. Rave reviews, fresh ingredients, and generous portions made my friends very happy. I tasted some of the sauce and found it to be well seasoned with just a hint of spicy tanginess. Very nice. I also loved the texture; the inclusion of tomato and herbs without totally pulverizing them is a big plus.

Also a plus were the crisp, fresh salads, robust cheeses, and lots of cracked black pepper.

And, of course, we enjoyed selections off a very respectable wine list. 

The service was a tad slow and they were not busy, so there's a bit of a ding there. However, it was still a fantastic meal that I am looking forward to repeating."}
{"text":"I've been eating here for years. My wife loves the place. The staff is top notch. The food is always good. Try the Pescara or the sea bass."}
{"text":"Food is okay, service is okay, prices are okay for pasta but waaaaay too high for any non-pasta based dish."}
{"text":"Very average Italian family restaurant in Las Vegas area.  If you have kids, it is reasonably priced,and definitely caters to families.  Nothing fancy on the inside, but good food at reasonable prices.

Waiter was not the most best we have ever heard.  There were long periods where we never saw him.  Drinks stayed empty for a good 10 minutes before he came with an offer to refill."}
{"text":"The food was exquisite. I came here expecting to order chicken piccata which is my go to, but their fish selection was so expansive and they have fresh fish flown in daily. Server and staff were very attentive. Everyone in our party loved their food. We love this restaurant."}
{"text":"This is probably the best Italian restaurant in town. From appetizers to their entrées to their desserts, everything was good. Our server Donna was just excellent. She knew exactly what she was doin and so good with the kids. (Really big deal for me as a mom)"}
{"text":"Was here twice within a 2 1/2 week time period.  The first visit was a large group and it was a business dinner.  They were fairly busy but the wait staff was excellent in being quick getting our drink orders and appetizers.  Dinner was great, everybody enjoyed their meals,  there were no complaints and the service was efficient quick and courteous. The second time we had the same great service again another large group the food was excellent all prepared well, but service was kind of slow even though it was not a busy night.  Overall, we would definitely visit this restaurant again and would recommend to anyone in the area.  Their menu is fairly large so there are plenty to choose from even for picky eaters and the pricing is very reasonable.  Alcoholic beverages are made a little on the strong side so be aware."}
{"text":"I've been here several times and it has always been amazing! Great food and even better service!  Took a date there last night and like usual the food and service were fantastic! I had the linguini w clam sauce(red) and my date had the Chicken cacciatore both dish left an empty plate! The house wine was also amazing! If your going out for Italian this place is a must!

Oh yeah the late night dinner atmosphere  feels like your in an episode of the Sopranos. This place has it all!!!"}
{"text":"Yes the food is good. But the service?  Depends on who you get...Sheryl and Rhonda are great but the men???  The young guys are pretty good but the older men should really take some classes. We took 2 business associates out for dinner. The first bottle of wine was good except the waiter  forgot to give me some wine after I did the tasting. When the second bottle came he brought 1 new glass, let me taste out of the new glass then proceeded to refill everyone else's glass even though it still had wine in it!  Come on...for the price of the food you would think the waiters would at least know how to pour wine correctly!!!  The older men including the host (at least the night we were there) did not have a very professional attitude...when we arrived ahead of our guests and told the host this, he said, \"well, do you wanna sit down?\".  Hmmm, I think the next time we will take our money to a more professional place."}
{"text":"Awesome  food  and service.  The veal was cooked  perfectly and the atmosphere was great.  I would  highly recommend this  restaurant for anyone looking for  great  Italian  food."}
{"text":"I ordered the chicken cattorchorie and the pieces if chicken tasted old. the sauce sucked.  the staff took a long time toseat us and there was no people before us.  service slow. the bus boy was quick.  theywant u tohurry andeat at 8 pm on Thursday nite.  no thank you."}
{"text":"Second time here.  First time just dropped in without any knowledge of the place.  (Out of towner and did not know the area was upscale.)  Both times my husband and I were extremely happy with our meals.  Wait staff is very attentive. Outside of the building is nothing to write home about.  The inside is very nice.  Relaxed atmosphere. Very Very clean. We will be back every time we are in Las Vegas.  About 3 times a year. 

My only complaint is that it is noisy.  The floor is tiled and my guess is that there is nothing to absorb the noise. (Lots of talking going on) Maybe some tapestries or something to deaden the sound.  This aspect will not stop us from going back.  I have superduper hearing.  Maybe the noise level is okay and it is just me:)"}
{"text":"This place is growing on me. I have been back twice since my original review for the Monday night prime rib special. Both times service was excellent and the food was very good. The Monday special is a four course prime rib dinner for $22.95. You get a shrimp cocktail (3 large shrimp), soup or salad, prime rib with a side (baked potato, mashed potatoes or a veggie), and a slice of their house made cheesecake. 

It's a great deal and both times the prime rib was excellent. We ordered it rare and it was very tender and juicy. The cheesecake is made in house and it is really creamy with an excellent flavor. Tuscany Grill definitely deserves an upgrade to 4 stars!"}
{"text":"I love this place . I always order their pasta fagiole . Excellent customer service!"}
{"text":"I can't believe we haven't been here before last night. We had an amazing experience from the top notch service to the delicious food.  Can't wait to return."}
{"text":"Had a very nice Prime Rib dinner that was very large and worth the money, but the salad was for shit and the dressing was to be French, but I don't know what it was.  My lady had a fish dinner that was small and over priced.  Actually I have had better in the Grand Café at Green Valley Ranch."}
{"text":"What is not to love?  They still include a delicious soup or salad with your meal.  The food is always good.  Excellent ltalian dishes, great sauces, fish, wines, etc.  The service is always friendly and efficient.  This family has been feeding locals and visitors alike for many years.  May it always be so!!!"}
