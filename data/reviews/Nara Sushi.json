Terriyaki sauce is thick and sweet. Tempura fried shrimp + vegetables wonderful. They have yummy chewy bulgogi as well. Lot's of street parking in this neighborhood block of homes. We will be back !"}
{"text":"Local sushi spot. Normally order take out here. Sushi is cheap , quick and scrumptious! Delivery is always very quick. The people that run it are really kind and usually throw in a free miso soup and salad to any of your orders. Our go to sushi spot for a fast and affordable during the week takeout spot !"}
{"text":"You know the Japanese restaurant is good when their dynamite roll is served fresh with warm shrimp tempura. Perfect pieces of tasty high quality fish. Love this place!"}
{"text":"Great little local Japanese restaurant.   Good value, nice service and great food.   We often pick up sushi or get delivery.   Less than 10 tables and food is fast and fresh."}
{"text":"Rating: 2 1/2* for the food with the extra 1/2* for the service.

My wife and I finally decided to try this place as we passed it quite often on our way home. 

We came on a Friday afternoon after 4pm and we were the only customers in the restaurant. The place is tiny but clean and nicely decorated. We got seated very quickly. This restaurant seems to be a family owned business. Although they weren't anybody else, it seems that their takeout business is a big part of their sales as they were quite busy with orders. That made us feel a little better about our decision about dining here.

We decided to go with their 32pc Sushi Boat along with a Tempura Udon which came fairly quickly. The Udon came first and unfortunately, it was quite bland. The broth was lacking flavour.

The sushi was simply average. The ratio of fish to rice was skewered towards the rice. The fish was okay. Prices were on the high side.

Service was really good but then again we were the only customers in the restaurant.

Not likely to come back...

{"text":"I quite enjoyed my lunch here yesterday. I came with a friend and we managed to find a parking spot right in front. Yay! We were the first ones in, and the whole place smelled really heavily of bleach, so we sat on the front patio. That was probably the only thing that really bothered me about the restaurant, but really, there are worse things you can smell at a restaurant.

Service was friendly and prompt and the food was quite good. Not the best ever, but very good for the prices and fresh. I'll definitely be back again."}
{"text":"Best Japanese food on upper avenue road!  Amazing miso soup!

Don't go to the place across the street \"Issmi\".  Unfriednly staff and overpriced.  

What makes Nara so good is that it's family run and the quality of the sushi is excellent.   It has always been extremely fresh except one time out of many that I have been there. I usually order a sushi combination along with Gyoza and miso soup.  The miso soup is the best I have had anywhere."}
{"text":"UPDATE: I don't know if they changed owners, but the spicy tuna definitely changed. It is NO WHERE as good as it used to be. PLEASE CHANGE IT BACK!

Love their lunch specials! I get takeout from here at least once a week.

My favourite are their spicy salmon and spicy tuna - actually spicy - no spicy mayo added!

Their side salad and miso soup are good as well!

Their wasabi is actually fresh, unlike some places that give stale wasabi.

The place is a bit cramped if you plan to go with a large party.

Thumbs up that they give 13% cash discount on pick up orders!

Note: Their lunch specials have recently gone up slightly."}
{"text":"I spent quite a while on Avenue Road looking for somewhere for dinner one evening while relatively hungry and within someone with gluten concerns. Having seen the lines at a few places that would have met those needs, we settled here seeing a couple empty tables and no lineup.
We placed our order after tables that had arrived after us and I'm fairly certain that other tables received part of our order. We also received our food long after they did.
Donburi was the smallest portion I've ever had anywhere and not even average. Teriyaki came served on a sizzling plate with tons of veggie. Sushi, once we received it, was excellent. Not expensive for what was ordered and no charge for Japanese tea.
As mentioned, service left much to be desired and food was touch and go depending on the order. I learned why there was no line here.
2.5/5 on this visit; the placemats read takeout and delivery, it might be best to keep it so. Some incredibly loud children also took away from the dining experience, the small dining room didn't help."}
{"text":"I live in the area where the sushi restaurant is. Every single week for the last four years or five years we've ordered from this restaurant. They've made mistakes they've made up for in many cases. once my wife got very ill from eating the sushi. They were very apologetic and made up for it which I appreciated. This evening I called in an order and spoke with Charles. My order came to $28.17. He told me that there is a $30 minimum order. They know that I've been loyal to them over the years because they have my orders/order history in their computer and they deliver to us all the time. They would not deliver my order because the difference of $1.83.
I was floored at the fact that they were going to push me to order something else just to meet their minimum. I spend thousands of dollars every year at this small sushi shop as a sign of loyalty to the small businesses and supporting the small businesses in this area. Charles gave me nothing but attitude and grief. I highly suggest you do not order from this restaurant as loyalty is not one of their top priorities for people in this area.
Do yourself a favour and go somewhere else. As for Charles this individual was not born for customer service."}
{"text":"Nara Sushi offering Lunch Specials Everyday till 4:00 pm from $7.95 is not a bad deal.

This is a tiny neighbourhood family owned restaurant that have a menu of both Japanese and Korean food. 

Lunch Specials Sushi ($9.95) with soup and salad 
- California Roll with 6 nigiri
- Fish was quite fresh and the rice was A-OK

If you in the area and have some sushi cravings, come here but doesn't worth a special trip.

The restaurant itself is clean with friendly and attentive service. A special note to the nice tablewares they are using... no plastic bowls or plates!!

Takeout is 13% off if pay by cash."}
