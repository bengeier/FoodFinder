{"text":"Good experience with the hot plate and great services!!!  Reasonable prices and earl grey ice cream is gooooood!!!"}
{"text":"I had a craving for brownies and ice cream the other night so we decided to give this place a try. They have a good number of choices with house made ice creams and at first I thought the prices were a little much for just dessert but after eating it I think it is worth the indulgence once in a while. We went at night, some time after 9PM, and we were the only table. The atmosphere is nice and simple.   I had the waffle hot plate with earl grey ice cream, brownie bits, mixed nuts, and chocolate cream sauce. The ice cream was really good! I could actually taste the tea. I decided to go with the waffle instead of the brownie base since I figure the brownie topping would be the same kind of brownie just crumbled up, so why not have best of both worlds?   We also tried the milk and honey toast mountain. It had vanilla cardamom ice cream and green apples. There weren't very many apple pieces. The ice cream had a bit of a spice to it, something not everyone may like but I enjoyed it. Everything had to be eaten in one bit to appreciate the combination of flavours.   My hot plate dish and the toast mountain were the same price but I think the hot plate was more worth it. ($10)"}
{"text":"Poor service at this place. They refuse to seat you if your entire party isn't here even when the place is half empty. We had 3/4 people standing around for 15 minutes. The water glasses were filthy. Had to change them twice. We had the s'mores thick toast and the hot plate waffles. The s'mores toast was soggy and poorly put together while the hot plate was all burned at the bottom by the time we got them. I would not return to this establishment. FOODIES BEWARE!"}
{"text":"Finally come .Fancy decorate. We Order one waffle hotplate and cheese corn, both very yummy desert? the cheese is a little bit salty, but the waffles is great. Great place for friends to chat"}
{"text":"Their waffle served on a hot plate is very special. It also comes with a sauce of your own choice and you get to pour it on while the plate is still sizzling hot. They made all the ice cream themselves, tried both their green tea and earl grey ice cream. The green tea was alright, the earl grey ice cream has a really strong tea flavour which I liked. Other than the ice cream, the rest is nothing too special. I don't think it is worth the $8.   Smores toast aka marshmallow on a toast with graham crackers on marshmallow. Super sweet as expected, nothing too special.   We also ordered a milk and honey toast mountain. This time we picked cookies and cream ice cream. Toast is covered with honey and condensed milk. I personally liked this dessert best out of all the ones I tried today maybe cause I personally love condensed milk. However this is quite big and you need at least 2-3 people to finish it.   Small place...went 2 weeks in a Saturday at around 10:30pm and was told we had to wait 45 mins. We left and decided to go back today (again on a sat) this time earlier at 9:30pm and we didn't have to wait at all! They do not accept reservations so go early to avoid The wait."}
{"text":"Great hospitality and my order arrive in a timely manner. The food however is mediocre at best. I had the Belgian waffle with earl grey ice cream, seasonal fruit and brownies.  The Belgian waffle looked good. Every bite was crunchy and it was spot on. However, the waffle had a hint or a little more of burnt flavour. The Belgian waffle wasn't as light as I thought it would be as well. The pineapple wasn't great but the pears were good. Their brownies were hard and crispy which I thought was caused y the hot plate."}
{"text":"It is quiet and small clean cafe where good for chatting.  we ordered a Strawberry soda and Japanese popcorn green tea.  They are really good. Everything is home made."}
{"text":"They ran out of vanilla ice cream, but the earl grey was good. I had the 'Milk and Honey Toast' for $8.50 with earl grey ice cream instead of vanilla, pretty good. Their tea wasn't all that good, standard."}
{"text":"Great service and great food at a good price ~ the hot waffles mixed with cold icecream was amazing, plus the combination of earl grey icecream with matcha cream was great! Will definitely be coming back"}
{"text":"I will never go back again! Food is ok but service is terrible. The menu is very limited and it's not customer friendly at all. We have to go up to the front to see choices of ice cream and tea. Half of its menu is toast but after 5 mins of taking our order, the girl told us they ran out of toast... and when the hot plate is up, the girl came up again apologizing they forgot to put nuts in our order... if you are not capable of serving, please don't!"}
{"text":"Came here with my friend for a catch up date. They open at 3pm. So double check timings before coming here.   I had to create my own waffle plate. They have other options for dessert but I would suggest create your own.  You pick between brownies or waffles. I picked the waffle and they the type of sauce you would like, ice cream and toppings.   They have very unique ice cream flavours!!   My experience here was amazing I would definitely come back again!   They have a couple savoury options too!"}
{"text":"Came here with another dessert lover on a Friday night to check this place out. We liked it! The menu is small but everything is made in-house.  We ordered their unique hot plate dessert and a lime tart to share. For the hot plates, you choose a base of either brownies or waffles, then you choose an ice-cream flavour, a sauce and a topping. We went with brownies, Earl Grey ice-cream, vanilla sauce and cookie crumbles. That was a great combination, if I could say so myself! The vanilla sauce complements everything especially the Earl Grey flavour. The sauce is served in a little jug and you pour it over the dessert and watch it boil and bubble on the hot plate. Don't pour it all but save some for your own plate as the sauce will dry out on the hot plate. The brownie was soft and chewy and the chocolate chip cookie was the chewy and gooey, fabulous! I loved the ice-cream, such a nice Earl Grey flavour! The lime tart had a great shortbread crust and soft lime curd. I felt the curd was a little too soft and not cold enough. Good taste though. They didn't have decaf coffee so we didn't have any.   Price was, it's not too bad. $4 for a tart, $8.50 for a hot plate. Coffee at $3 is a little more expensive.   Good place, comfortable and not noisy although the noise level did go up when the shop is full. It was full after 9pm. Service was friendly but a little slow, not a problem if you're not in a rush. Parking could be a problem in this small plaza as there is a restaurant (Dayali) and a ChaTime there.   I liked this place, will be back!"}
{"text":"This is a cute little Dessert place. Had a lot of variety to pick from and god customer service. i got the waffle; seemed to be the best for the price you got. They are known for their waffles."}
{"text":"Amazing desert place. Ordered their signature dessert which is a hot plate. You choose if you want brownie or waffles, your ice cream flavor, two toppings and a sauce. It was all really delicious. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Okay decor/atmosphere. Was a little empty when we went, so that could have detracted from it a bit. Ice cream choices and overall concept of the place are awesome!  Found the waffle one step below Wanda's (not as sweet and moist) but better than Destiny's or Demitris I would say.   Service was really nice."}
{"text":"I've tried quite a few of the dishes offered at this place. My favourites would have to be hot plate with matcha sauce and either oolong or earl grey ice cream. The ice cream is especially yummy and they make it in house! I just bought a tub of oolong ice cream today because I just can't get enough. It's $12 for 1 tub or $20 for 2 which is pretty good considering one scoop for dine-in is $3.50. I've also tried a couple savoury dishes. I especially liked the corn hot plate one (sigh, forgot the exact name). Their kimchi pork belly toast is also pretty interesting.   For drinks, I've only tried the hk milk tea, which was pretty decent.  I really dig the atmosphere/ambience of the place. There's a pretty white brick wall perfect for those instagram photos haha. Also, they're very supportive of local arts - there's a shelf of some local artwork and magazines for sale at the back, some artwork framed and hung on the walls, and also some pretty white-ink drawings on their front windows.   In the past couple of months they had a series of live music nights called Unplugged Mondays which is not something you see a lot in Markham! I thought that was pretty cool."}
{"text":"They close at 10:30pm not 11pm. The girl turned us away at 10:28 with last call. They need to update their hours, we travelled quite a bit to try it lol."}
{"text":"Tiny shop located in the same plaza as Cha time.   The server here are quite friendly.   Their tea is really refreshing which reminds me of David's tea; the coffee here is alright.  I like the assortment of the waffle and ice cream.  The idea of dessert being on a hot plate sounds awesome but the draw back was dried crunchy waffle.  If you let the ice cream melt,  the liquid sort of compensate the dry waffle lol it was a nice little tea time experience but I would probably stick to ice cream and waffle without the hot plate."}
{"text":"Loved it, I went here last night after watching a movie ! Service was amazing our waiter explained everything to us throughly, wait time for the dessert was short. The dessert it self was soooo good, the brownie was rich but not in your face sweet, the earl grey ice cream was flavourful, the fresh fruit A+, and the concept of the hot plate was so cool it upped our experience. Im bringing more of my friends here! Ill be back"}
{"text":"Saw a lot of good reviews for this place so I thought I would check it out. Their ice cream was fantastic but their service was lacklustre. They kept asking if they can take our plate while food was still left on it and as soon as we finished eating, they said that there were people waiting for a table and that we should settle our bill soon. Though they weren't rude, their asking of us leave really upset us. Now that we've left, we're not coming back."}
{"text":"Walked in and was impressed right away by the decor and ambiance.  The artistic touch put into this place is very subtle and classy.  They had great window art and fixtures throughout the whole place.  The ceiling was a joy to look at with all the floating triangles.  In the back was a very cute decor corner of various prints, knick-knacks, and art pieces.  We we were seated and opened up their beautiful menu.  It was crisp and modern, full of amazing close up shots of the food we were going to eat!  Ordered the waffle hot plate and omg it was so good.  Belgian waffle + matcha ice cream + nuts and vegetables - the presentation was amazing and the taste was amazing.  Perfectly crunchy waffle with nice and solid ice cream.  Had Earl Tea Ice cream on the side as well.  I love all the different unique ice cream flavors they have available, which is all made in-house.  Overall a great experience - will definitely come back"}
{"text":"Pretty decor. Service was very friendly. It got a little busy when we went Friday night. The hot plates are pretty cool which are $8.50. The portions are on the smaller size but everything is super sweet so your pancreas will thank you. They don't have a lot of options. Wish there were more hot drinks.   Place has great lighting making some nice instagram shots."}
{"text":"Just ordered a chocolate tart, created my own waffle plate and a s'mores toast with the total of $20. The portions are pretty good that would make you full. The waffles are crunchy and tasty, ice cream is delicious as well I recommend the earl grey. Also, the s'mores toast is a must try! Chocolate tart was okay. This place is really tidy and clean which I really love !"}
{"text":"Presentations were great! But taste was moderate.. The waffle itself was plain and stale. Would've given higher rating if the waffles taste better. If you are looking for a place to eat waffles for similar price, I suggest Caffe Demetre or Cafe Mirage.  Though I must say that we enjoyed our $4.25 ginger lychee tea, and it was free hot water refill! And the place had a great relaxing atmosphere (..maybe for studying?). :)  We came Saturday at 6:i and just us.. The place started filling in when we were about to leave, at around 7:40pm."}
{"text":"I'm going to spare you the suspense. This is the BEST dessert I've had in a while. I'm not a dessert person, but I've been converted. Waffle Jesus blessed me tonight. Now the beginning. We walk into a very cool and modern space. The numbers on the wall clock are composed of jumbled fonts. Very artsy & creative, something you'd probably see trending on Pinterest (I don't know how Pinterest works, but let's pretend I do). There's hollowed out pyramids dangling from above the bar. The chairs - probably the heaviest chairs in Markham - are comfy. Music and entire vibe is extremely chill (kids still say that, right?). Ok, so now the food. We order the waffles (obviously) with chocolate sauce and earl grey ice cream (?), with cookie chunks. I was skeptical about the earl grey ice cream, and I couldn't have been more wrong! Our order arrived on a hot plate (again, very unique). We poured the chocolate sauce and our dessert sizzled. We couldn't be more excited to dig in! Like the wall clock, the dessert was a jumbled mix, but of excellent flavours! It was precisely composed, perfect, like clock work!   Love this place! Definitely coming back."}
{"text":"Came here with two other girls and we decided to share a hot plate since we were coming right after dinner. Definitely the right choice!  We order the hot plate with a Brownie base, vanilla cream,Earl Grey ice cream with marshmallow and chocolate chunks as the toppings. We added an extra topping that was $0.50 on top.   I'll have to say.... I've heard some good things about this place but it was even better than I expected!   The mini marshmallows were a great idea on a hot plate. The taste of the gooey and slightly charred marshmallow reminded me of BBQ in the summers.   The brownie was soooo good, soft and moist, totally exceeded my expectations.    And the ice cream, just enough earl grey. Not too overpowering and it complimented well with the rest of the hot plate.   Will definitely come back to try their matcha ice cream (they were sold out that night) and their other seasonal flavours in the future :)"}
{"text":"Came on a Saturday night 10pm, no wait needed, probably got lucky. This is a clean and bright place that serves dessert and specialty teas. You can customize your dessert by waffle/brownie, vanilla/chocolate/green tea sauces, your choice of ice cream (they have various special in-house ice cream). They also have thick toasts, and smores inspired thick toasts.  Ordered the Earl Grey ice cream green tea sauce waffles on hot plate Dessert came within 5 mins after ordering, the ice cream is creamy smooth and the flavor is unique, very tea-ful if that is a word. Waffles are good, not super good but went well with the ice cream. Could not take the green tea sauce tho. Overall, it is pretty good with the whole thing on a hot plate so its like hot and cold in your mouth kind of thing. $8.50 each.   Loved the service, servers were very attentive with smiles and they are proactive in offering assistance with menu. They also joked about how pictures are welcome but just dont take too long since ice cream is gonna melt on hot plate.  5 stars and will def come back for their ice cream. Some ice cream flavours were sold out by the time we came."}
{"text":"I've only tried the waffle + earl grey ice cream + cookies and brownie bits + vanilla cream.   Could've been more generous with the toppings - I guess I'm too used to the heaping amount of toppings and sauces from other places like Demetre's and Spin.   Earl grey ice cream was good! Definitely worth the try"}
{"text":"Most people come for the hot plate desserts and I was one of those people also. We ordered a hotplate with green tea ice cream, our toppings were fruit and cookie bits (can't remember what sauce we chose. The dessert was really good and perfect for two people to share. It was fun to pour the sauce over the waffles and watch it sizzle. I like that there are so many customizations you can do plus there were a lot of unique ice cream flavours. We also ordered an Italian soda and that was pretty decent also. This place is pretty small so I recommend coming earlier in the night if you don't want to wait for a spot. Very cute date spot also!"}
{"text":"|| Must Try: Waffles and House-made Ice Cream  || Rating: (8/10) Food, (8/10) Service, (8/10) Value, (9/10) Ambience, (10/10) Presentation, (10/10) Cleanliness  || My Experience:    The decor and presentation of this small shop in Markham amplify the overall experience at this dessert spot. You can custom make your waffles, from the waffle type, ice cream, toppings and sauce. The best part is how fresh the waffles are made. However, everyone has different opinions on waffles, and I found these ones a bit too chewy. The real stand out of the dish is the house made ice cream!   The house made ice cream changes from day to day, but we were really blown away by how fresh and delicious it was. We had a coffee flavour ice cream and loved it so much, we got an extra side scoop of earl grey ice cream. Highly recommend!  The drink menu is decent, with a good variety of teas and specialty cold drinks, include a \"Dino Ovaltine\" which featured some malt mixed in.   Had a great first experience, and loved the freshness of the dishes. We will return to try some of the toast dishes next time!"}
{"text":"Ordered their tarts and signature hot plate ice cream. I loved the food and feel. Definitely recommend and bring my friends!"}
{"text":"I've been here long ago back when they first opened. Their waffles were good.   I came here recently and ordered waffles again. Way too overdone and i'm not really a fan of the flavour of the waffles. As for their ice cream, it was really good. Probably the only thing i'd come back for. I feel like they're a bit stingy on their toppings. We got mixed fruits and brownies. The fruits were the tiniest bits ever, and the brownies were just crushed up crumbs. Maybe it's for presentation purposes.. but come on. Probably only used half of a \"two-bite\" brownie for one dish.   I also tried their mixed fruit tart which was really good."}
{"text":"Earl gray ice cream was good, chocolate tart wasn't too special.  Avoid dropping the ice cream on to the hot plate as it melts to ice cream faster than you can eat it!"}
{"text":"The thick toast here is phenomenal! We had the Fruit Jungle with Earl gray ice cream and matcha sauce, this combination was quite good, especially loved the earl gray ice cream. Also had the Matcha Mountain which had matcha sauce, thick toast, ice cream and red bean. It is my favourite combination!   Had the italian Sodas the combinations are interesting but I prefer the italian sodas at Second Cup. Would want to try their other drinks next time.   The waitress was really friendly and attentive. There is free WiFi. The place is great for taking food pictures, if you're interested and the food looks as good as it tastes."}
{"text":"I'm in a bind whether to rate them 4-star or 3-star. Went here last night for dessert.   Food - I had a hot plate as recommended by the waitress. The ritual is that you choose from below:  Step 1: 2 Brownies or 3/4 waffle; Step 2: 1 scoop of ice-cream out of 7-8 available flavours; Step 3: Choose 2 toppings out of seasonal fruits, cookie crumble, marshmallows, mixed nuts, brownie bits Step 4: Choose a sauce from vanilla, chocolate or matcha It was pretty good. The ice cream was very flavourful.   Service - was okay. My biggest gripe is that they don't let you try the ice cream flavours and their flavours are very unusual (like oolong, matcha, jasmine, earl grey, vanilla cinnamon) so you would wish that you could try a couple before ordering. You don't wanna go there and order vanilla as that would be sacrilegious. We ordered earl grey and it was pretty good. Plus the waitress gave us the wrong bill, glad that we noticed.  Price - I found everything quite pricey. 10$ for a couple of brownies and a scoop of ice cream seems exorbitant to me, plus tax and tip run you in the neighborhood of 15 $, while you just shared one friggin' dessert. Their ice cream was good no doubt, but i would rather just take a tub for 12 $ and eat at home. Tarts for 4 $ a piece. Cappucino/Latte for 4.25 $ each; they aren't no Dineen.  If you don't mind the price and want to try a decent dessert, do visit them."}
{"text":"I'm stuck between choosing between a 3 and a 4 star because this place was good, but there many things that could be improved upon. I love the whole concept of getting your dessert served on a boiling plate and then pouring your cream onto your brownie or waffles (their specialty dish). This makes for very cool instagram and snapchat stories. I got the waffle with the green tea, vanilla cream and the fruits as the topping ($8.50). It was quite hard to decide because their ice cream flavours all seemed very good (vanilla cardamom, coffee milk tea, green tea). The presentation was nice; pouring the hot cream on the plate was fun. I did wish that the cream wasn't all evaporated because I would have wanted to eat more of it with my waffle. The waffle was a bit too bland and could have been sweeter. The green ice cream was bland as well. It had the matcha taste but wasn't as creamy and sweet as it should be.   What was really annoying was I had to get out of my seat several times to see what ice cream flavours were available for the day etc. I would suggest maybe placing another board on the wall with the ice cream flavours on the opposite wall in the restaurant so the people seated beside the bar, further in the restaurant, can see what flavours are available for the day. Also service was fine, but the server didn't bother filling up our water glasses until we asked her. After that, she seemed to keep on coming to our table to refill our glass.  I will probably come back again and hopefully I can change this review to four stars."}
{"text":"Tried their build your own plate. Choose waffle with Earl grey and oolong ice creams with green tea cream sauce while having cookie chunks and cinnamon as toppings. Very satisfied! The Earl grey and oolong ice cream taste very favourable and would want to have that again. This will possibly goes good with a cup of green tea.  Also tried the coconut tart. Not too sweet but not very strong in coconut flavour as well.  Atmosphere is simple and not very loud. Nice place to have a chat with friends"}
{"text":"A solid dessert place in Markham. Service is great - friendly, polite and fairly quick. A small, hipster-y, cute interior. We ordered their chocolate brownie and waffles. We had to choose two toppings and one sauce for both. Their brownie is soft and chewy but crispy on the outside. Waffles were also delicious. I like how they serve their waffles and brownies in a hot plate, keeps it hot and sizzling especially when you pour the sauces! However, I feel their sauces are very runny in texture... They have a choice between vanilla, green tea and chocolate. All three seems almost tasteless to me.. (maybe because of the watery texture?) I wish they had fudge instead. Their house made earl grey ice cream is my favourite. You really taste the earl grey flavour and it is not too sweet. Would come back. 4/5."}
{"text":"I've been there a couple times and my favourite is their Earl Grey ice cream. However, I brought my friend there because she's never had it and it was a huge disappointment.   We ordered the Chicken and Waffles, which is essentially popcorn chicken and waffles. I love popcorn chicken, BUT when it came the chicken was over fried, it seemed like leftover popcorn chicken that they refried. It was also really hard to cut and bite. We informed the girl who was working and she apologized and brought us another serving of chicken. It was just as bad as the first batch, minus 1 or 2 pieces that were somewhat edible, but still not really.   The young girl that worked there was really sweet, but unfortunately I just couldn't understand/hear anything she said. If it wasn't for having been there before then I would've been really lost."}
{"text":"Cute and cozy little dessert place tucked away in a plaza. It's small but cozy enough for our group of four. They have interesting (and yummy) ice cream flavours and their waffles were great. Will be coming again :)"}
{"text":"I went to Sweet Esc with a couple of friends one night when we had a craving for dessert. The place had a very youthful, casual vibe. The decor was lovely!  I split a hot plate with a friend of mine. We had a brownie base with green tea ice cream topped with cookie crumble and vanilla sauce for $10. It was sweet, but not overly saccharine, making it a great place to go after dinner. The portion was a decent size. However, it might not be worth the price.   The girl serving us was knowledgable of the menu and able to give us suggestions. Also, by the looks of it, it seemed that she was the only worker in the place. That being said she was super nice and efficient!!  As it's slightly expensive, I do recommend splitting a hot plate with someone if you're not willing to fork over $10 for some ice cream and waffles/brownies. $5 is definitely less daunting than $10."}
{"text":"I came here hoping for a good cup of coffee, and ended up ordering the hot plate waffle with earl grey icecream and chocolate sauce. The hot place was delicous, though I wished there was more fruit on top. I believe the owner was serving me, she is very friendly and attentive. She keeps the place very clean and quaint. It's small and cozy, but modern.  Plus, the Americano I ordered was very good.   Would come here again!"}
{"text":"Ordered the corn cheese hot plate ($8). It was a little bit spicy. Comes with 4-6 pieces of brick toast. It was just average. Also got the oolong ice cream ($3.5 per scoop). Didn't have much of an oolong flavour but it was still very good."}
{"text":"Small dessert place that I finally got a stomach to try. It's at the Gibson corner plaza one street north of Warden and Steeles, same plaza as Chatime and that hot pot place.  Sweet Esc seems to be known for their build-your-own waffle ice cream as their menu is limited in other dessert choices such as tarts and toasts.  For Christmas, their seasonal ice cream flavours include Eggnog with Rum and Mint Fudge ripple. We ended up getting their classic Coffee Milk Tea flavour topped with chocolate sauce on waffles with seasonal fruits (one free topping).  The waffles came on a hot sizzling plate where we had to pour out chocolate sauce on before it cools. That was pretty cool of a scene and action! I was surprised how well done the waffles were, being slightly crunchy on the sides yet super soft overall. The hot and cold mix of ice cream and waffle with sauce was delicious! The coffee milk tea ice cream was good too - wasn't too overwhelming and dense. I have to admit there was more coffee taste than milk tea though.  We also ordered a marshmallow toast afterwards. It tasted great.. though if you ask me, any melted marshmallow tastes fantastic! But I still think Sweet Esc made it yummy, especially the texture overall.  Service was good. They explained briefly the seasonal flavours along and asked whether we were first-timers. Flip side: not that it bothers me but one waitress dropped and broke a whole bunch of tea cups and pots during my visit.. Oh well haha.  The interiors is very simple and lightly decorated. It's pretty much a tiny dessert place, not much to really feel a relaxation besides the food."}
{"text":"Been frequenting dessert places with a group of friends lately, so Saturday evening found us here at Sweet Esc. It's a small place with seating for only about 20 people, but fortunately we were late enough for there to be sufficient vacancy. The place is simply decorated and looks a bit like a pop-up, contrasting from 0109 which had an open-concept kitchen and a at-home crowded feeling. Sweet Esc's kitchen is neatly tucked away, keeping the atmosphere clean and simple.   Their hot plate special features a choice of brownie or Belgian waffle, with a scoop of ice cream in the flavour of your choice (from the daily selection), syrup in your choice between green tea, vanilla, and chocolate, and a topping of your choice (marshmallows, brownie bits, seasonal fruit, chocolate chip cookie chunks, etc.). Their menu promoted other varieties of similar items - some sort of baked item with ice cream on top, with sundae fix-ins. There's also a daily tart selection and daily cakes.  I was excited to see some unique ice cream flavours and the fact that it was ice cream, since the recent trend seems to be towards gelato. I ha their coffee milk tea ice cream which was reminiscent of the Hong Kong classic. A crowd favourite is their earl grey ice cream, but I'm not much a fan of the flavour in general, so I took a pass. My waffle was soft and kept warm by the hot plate, and when I poured the chocolate syrup over it sizzled and burnt a bit - a great snapchat or short video photo opportunity if you're into that kind of social media. The scoop of ice cream was a good, satisfying size that held up to the heat creating that intriguing hot-cold contrast all on one plate. One downside is the inevitable slow burning of everything due to the hot plate, not at all ideal for a slow eater. To further the struggle, be careful you don't burn yourself, which I can only imagine is a common occurrence if you have say, long hair, too many people at the table squished together, or you're trying to share with others, or even if your plate wasn't set in front of you just right. The wooden board supporting the hot iron plate does help, but accidents could happen.   Observing my friends' orders, the seasonal fruit turned out to be pineapple and strawberry which was skimpy in portion. Their green tea sauce was an interesting flavour contrast, which I imagine could be good with particular ice cream flavours.  For the price of $8.50, the treat was good to try on occasion and for aesthetic appeal. Sweet Esc doesn't come close to the top of my list of dessert places as there were no significant points apart from the generously sized scoop of ice cream in a unique flavour. Just for the one scoop would've came to $4-$5, which is a bit steep for just some ice cream with no fix-ins or anything of the sort. The lack of allure also means their signature just didn't stand out, and nothing else on the menu popped at me to attract a return visit."}
{"text":"This is a  small cozy place that hosts simplistic decor. My partner and I did visit on a Friday night,  and it wasn't packed at all. However, a little past 9pm was when we started to see more people. Service was good as well.   We ordered the Blueberry Tart, Waffle with earl grey ice cream and seasonal fruits. The blueberry tart was truly a let down. All the berries were basically frozen berries on top of a pastry cookie shell. Even a sprinkle of sugar on top didn't seem to make much of a difference to the overall taste. I would not recommend this at all. Or you can ask the server ahead of time to see what exactly is in there (I imagine this may change depending on seasonal fruit availability).  The waffle was a bit better for their signature dessert that you can customize. With our waffle, we ordered the earl grey ice cream, which was very good. Cherries and pineapples were apparently our fruits on the hot plate. The waffle was a bit dryer than I usually imagine waffles to be. On the bright side, you do get to choose a cream to drizzle on the dish (we got green tea cream which did add a bit of flavor to the waffles aside from the ice cream).  If I was purely rating the place as an ice cream store, it would have had a higher rating. But having tried the other options, it was a bit of a let down."}
{"text":"Came here today, nothing special   A little over priced for 3 pieces of waffle and a scoop of ice cream for $9.50 including tax..  The service was really good and helpful. The chocolate hazelnut ice cream we ordered wasn't that tasty in my opinion.  It is neat how they serve the waffle on a hot plate though. But, I probably won't be coming back unless  I feel like trying their thick toast."}
{"text":"-- My First impression --  I was craving for dessert and we spontaneously decided to go to this dessert place which is 10 minutes drive from our home. I was actually quite surprised that the place was 80% empty (when I read other yelp review, this little dessert place is always full of people). My first impression was that the cafe had a modern looking design, it's perfect for couple dates. I liked how the restaurant walls were in white so it makes it looked more spacious. The restaurant was very clean and tidy which made me feel very comfortable. My husband actually liked their chairs a lot (they were made of wood and were pretty heavy. It felt very sturdy).   -- Food & Drink --   I ordered a Belgian Waffles with Chocolate Cream with Earl Grey Ice-cream and Seasonal Fruits. Originally, my husband would like to order the honey matcha cheesecake. Unfortunately, they told us the cake was sold out. He ended up order the blueberry tart. The server suggested us to order the Guangzhou Milk Oolong tea and it paired perfectly with both desserts. My husband loved the blueberry tart a lot and he said it was the best blueberry tart he had ever tasted. The crust was very crunchy on the outside and the blueberry paste was sweet, tangy and very moist. The waffle on sizzling pan is definitely the most unique and creative experience I've ever had. The waffles were way crunchier after heating up on the sizzling pan. It would be appreciated if they could provide some extra sauce. I would normally assume seasonal fruits mean strawberry, pineapple or other berries. Since I am allergic to Kiwi, I had to skip part of my dessert.   Nonetheless, this was a great experience, the waffle and tart was tasty. I would come back to try the matcha cheesecake and other savory dishes."}
{"text":"This is a semi unique idea that was talked about all over last year and as a dessert fan, I gave it a try with some friends when there was still a discount for checking into sweet esc via facebook.  I was quite intrigued by the hot plate dessert so I got waffles as a base with green tea cream, earl grey ice cream and brownies as a topping. We got the best of both worlds by having the waffles base and the brownies topping!  My favourite part of the dessert was definitely the home-made earl grey ice cream. It was so light and refreshing which balanced the overall heaviness of the brownies and waffles.  Will definitely be back to buy take home pints of their earl grey ice cream!"}
{"text":"Rating: 3.0/5.0  Decided to drop by this place for the first time believe it or not as I was in the area for dinner. It has been open for quite some time with fairly good reviews. The space was clean and minimalistic. As well the service was friendly and attentive. In terms of this dessert, it was pretty much what you would expect - nothing mind blowing or something that I would need to come back for more.  The waffle should be the most important component of this dessert as it was supposedly made in house. However it definitely fell short from my perspective as it was quite soft and did not have that light crispy texture on the outside. The jasmine matcha was also quite light in flavour though it did hold up well all the way through to the end without melting too quickly. Portion size was good enough to share for two people."}
{"text":"I can not rate this place. I particularly went there for their hot plate waffles after I heard so much about them and saw corresponding photos. However, I went and the server stated they no longer sell waffles or any other treat. They only sell ice cream... so disappointing!"}
{"text":"When there on Saturday evening around 7. It's our first time here. When we arrived, there was only one table been sat. The server came to tell us their specialties and went back to the kitchen.  We waited at least 5 minutes in the table and went to the front to ask for ordering, we stand in front for another 5 minutes then she's finally coming back from the kitchen.  Consider with the long wait, we decided to get ice cream to go, sadly they don't have tub size anymore so we got two favourite, matcha and milk tea to go.  We waited for another 10 minutes for our ice-cream( which is a pretty long wait)  However, after tasted the ice cream, i can say it definitely worth the wait time and money.  Will definitely come back to get their tub size as well as try other favourite of ice cream !"}
{"text":"Was here with 3 other people total of 4, and we ordered two scoops of icecream, when the girl who came up to greet us and give us menus she asked us \"is this your first time here?\" and as we responded to \"yes, this is our first time here we don't know anything about this place\" she started recommending us items and left, we decided to order two scoops and she said nothing and left and brought us our icecream. As we were paying she said that we HAVE to buy more food or we can't leave because we have to pay a min fee for each person. She said it's store policy which was written in small fine lettering that she did not even mention to us as first time comers. On top of that she was super rude telling us about it and looked and talked to us as if we were supposed to know. Unhappily I was forced to buy two more scoops of icecream. NEVER coming back again and I'm for sure telling all my friends who are interested to never come here. Waste of my time and money"}
{"text":"First time trying something like this. Went with a friend and ordered two hot plate waffles. One with early grey icecream (which I loved!), matcha sauce and nuts. The other was matcha icecream, vanilla sauce and fruit."}
{"text":"The hot plate is a gimmick.   Everything tastes good, but the hot plate adds as much to the experience as if they told you the chef speaks 12 languages: nothing. It doesn't transform or enhance the waffle experience.  The hot plate order is like a build-a-bear custom order. You pick a base (waffles or brownies), ice cream (changes based on what is made in-house that day), sauce (vanilla, chocolate, matcha), and topping (seasonal fruits, nuts, etc.) I felt like their ice cream choices were a bit limiting. They only had three and they ran out of one from a big party the day before. They have other flavours like vanilla and green tea, but you can't pick them because they're reserved for thick toast or other dishes. It just feels restrictive for a \"custom\" dessert.   My friends actually tried to avoid getting any sauce or ice cream on the hot plate because they were like, \"They just disappear.\" I wasn't as bothered.   \"Seasonal fruits\" is code for \"random fruits\" because we ordered two different dishes with seasonal fruits and the fruits were different on both.   Between the hot plate and the thick toast mountains, I preferred the thick toast. It did feel like there should have been more condensed milk as the dish as a whole looked a little sparse and dry, but the overall dish was yummy.   Service was exceptional. Guy in a beanie was friendly and paid extra attention to whether it was our first time and reminded us to pour the sauce while the hot plate was still hot. Sounds straight forward but I always feel like over-explaining is more customer-focused than under.   For the portion size and the fact that their main draw is a slapped on gimmick, I don't feel compelled to return. However, based on just the taste of the food, I was satisfied."}
{"text":"This place looked a lot smaller than the pictures when I arrived. But it was super cute. My friend and I both got the coffee milk ice cream. It was super creamy and delicious. The waffles were dece.nt ... I have had better Belgian waffles. The environment was cozy and the workers were super kind. For the price the dessert was really good. Would definitely recommend it!"}
{"text":"Great deal for $10. Awesome customer service and tasty deserts, will definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"The hot plate waffle dessert idea is an unique one that you should try out once. However, not sure if it is worth it to try it again. The waffle (3/4 of one) is placed on a hot plate with fruit pieces and brownie crumbles. On top of it all is a scoop of ice cream. The fruits and brownies tasted supermarket-bought. The icecream melted too quickly and not before long it became a sweet soup of sorts."}
{"text":"The main attraction to this place is the presentation- to everything from the food to the decor to the seating is very pretty.   Also I would say the price isn't terrible as well. I got 3 tarts for 10$ and a small thick cake for about 6$ and the iced tea for 3$.   However the treats we got weren't that great. The tarts weren't very sweet and didn't have much filling. The cake was very chewy and hard to cut through. The iced tea didn't have much flavour maybe I should order it without the ice next time.  The waitress was the only one working and was very awkward. She hovered beside us until we ordered and stayed close while we were having conversations. We felt our privacy was being disrupted and left quickly as soon as we ate."}
{"text":"Compared to all the competing waffle dessert places, Sweet Esc does a great job catering towards a more Asian clientele. I say this because the portion sizes are smaller, the toppings are less heavy, and the ice cream flavours offered are more unique.    I tried the sizzling hot plate waffle with earl grey and coffee ice cream, and it was everything I expected it to be.  -8.5 rating for tastiness -9 rating for uniqueness -10 rating for being instagram-worthy"}
{"text":"I went to Sweet ESC on a weeknight around 6pm. We were the only table there but after 45 minutes or so the cafe started to fill up. I was a bit bummed that the earl grey ice cream was sold out (apparently it was sold out when my other friend went a few weeks back as well). If I could give half ratings, I would rate 3.5 - the extra 0.5 goes to the customer service and the ambience- it was very comfortable there and I had a good catch up session with a friend. I appreciated that the waffle was presented in a hot plate but we devoured it way too quickly, so we ordered tea to stay a bit longer and it's a good thing we did! Will likely go back and try the tarts and the genmaicha next time."}
{"text":"Don't order the Italian soda. Worse drink ever!! Italian soda has no fizz to it. Taste like flavoured flat water. Pop corn chicken overly fried ... Dried!!! I only enjoyed the earl grey icecream. But will not come back again."}
{"text":"Sweet escape is a small desert shop in Markham. The plaza that the store is located in doesn't seem the nicest but the inside is unbelievably cute. The aesthetic is very subtle and humble but the little touches such as the little jars filled with dried wildflowers and design magazines makes one feel comfortable. The staff is very helpful and informed! The food didn't take too long to prepare so the miniature wait was definitely worth it. They have homemade ice cream flavours that are really unique and the desert itself is not sickeningly sweet. The best thing about it is the presentation which is very unique from other desert shops!!"}
{"text":"We decided to order take out from this place and so we didn't get a chance to try the waffles.  We had the smores and a piece of cake.  The smores was good. nothing to write home about but not too bad and a fair price point.  The cake however was not good. It was dry and hard!  Stay away from the cake!!"}
{"text":"Food - Skip the savory food and order the dessert. I enjoyed the build your own hot plate with waffles as a base then your choice of ice cream, sauce and toppings. Most Earl Grey ice cream is subtle but not here.   Service - Quick and attentive."}
{"text":"Loved the fusion ice cream waffle. Location is very convenient. Should avoid going on Friday night as it is always busy."}
{"text":"Winter here in Toronto is the type of winter that everyone contradicted with a love hate relationship and Sweet Esc couldn't highlight my experience more.  I love Ice-cream. I'm drawn to its simplicity and perplexed by the endless supply of constantly growing flavors. Tonight happiness was home-made Belgian Waffles crowned with magnificent lavender essence of earl grey ice-cream all over a sizzling hot plate on a cold winter evening.   The melting of the ice-cream to the hot plate, for a brief time, seemed to be offering respite from the cold weather outside. A fixture of hanging decors of light and shadows to the timeless artwork of the clock on the wall turns the place into a sanctuary of warmth you share with the person you bring.   Sweet Esc knows that you can't buy happiness you can buy waffles and cream and that's kind of the same thing. In time waffles and ice cream became more than just desserts. They became touchstones that are almost immediately nostalgic and sentimental to better times.  I'd recommend anyone in the area to try!"}
{"text":"I ordered the Belgium waffles (you can pick either a waffle or brownie) on a hot plate with maple ice cream, brownie bits, and chocolate chip cookie chunks. The waffle is good, but you only get 3/4 of the waffle. The waffle piece under the ice cream is the best piece cause it's super crispy! All their ice creams are made in house. The maple flavour didn't really have any maple taste and was more like vanilla to me. The cookie chunks are soo good because it's warm and the chocolate chips are melted and gooey. It was all really sweet so I don't recommend getting this combo if you don't have a sweet tooth. It also comes with a vanilla/chocolate/matcha cream to pour over the waffle, but it didn't really add any taste.  The hot plates are $10 each and I think it's the perfect size to share with someone. The hot plates are a cute/cool new concept, so it's nice to go and try it once! They also serve other foods/drinks but it's pretty limited."}
{"text":"I came on a Tuesday night for the first time to this little cafe. It was pretty busy so service was a little slow but that wasn't a big deal. Definitely enjoyed their homemade ice cream the most that night. We tried the oolong and the coffee milk tea. Delicious! I'd definitely come back just to order a scoop of ice cream. We also tried the waffle on the hot plate. I'm a total sucker on presentation, so I was impressed. That night, we also ordered their passion fruit black tea. They said they couldn't make it less sweet so I was a little worried. However, it was made on point. Didn't taste like pure sugar. Overall, I did enjoy my experience here so I'll be back soon!!  ** For those that are wanting to try this small cafe, don't come with a party over 4. You wouldn't be able to sit together. Now that you know, there won't be any disappointment."}
{"text":"Such a great place to enjoy desserts with friends or alone, with lots of great concepts like hot plate waffles with HOMEMADE icecream! The owners are very creative and friendly, with new items coming out every now and then. If you ever see toffee cookies available, buy them right away! Tarts are such a treat too, and such a great gift with beautiful take-out containers. The interior decoration is also simple, modern, clean and classy.  Highly recommended alternative to just going for bubble tea, and stands out from other uptown dessert places that kinda feel blandly asian. Might make a great first date place. For sure a good hangout. I make sure to drop by whenever I'm nearby."}
{"text":"First time visiting this place. They no longer have the waffles. Only ice cream and drinks and some cookies. The menu said $5.50 for 2 scoops. We got two 2 scoop cups. I didn't check the bill until we left but later I realized they charged me $6.22+ taxes for the first one and $7.92+ taxes for the second one. Not sure if it's because the price increased but they didn't update the menu price on the wall. And I'm not sure why the first cup had a discount for two scoops and second cup didn't. Earl Grey and pandan flavours were good. Chocolate browney was too sweet. Honey orange was a little bitter.  There was no one by the counter when we entered the store. Two staffs came out after about 5 minutes and they didn't seem happy at all."}
{"text":"Great service.  Staff is friendly and we got seated immediately. Ordered the home made ice cream and it was delicious. The batter of the waffle was excellent and not over cooked or hard like some places. Only thing I found was a bit lacking is the amount of fruit they give you on your waffle order which costs like $8+ ... it was a bit lacking felt like all I ate was ice cream and pretty much the waffle for the price. Just a tip, ensure u at least be a bit more generous on your fruit portions."}
{"text":"The first time I tried this place was even before it was officially opened. I just so happened to be in the area and notice this and decided to go try it out. I got a hotplate waffle with their home made green tea ice cream and cookie bits. It was decently good. There was only 3 sections of the waffle (when you imagine a waffle you would imagine a big circle which can be cut into 4 sections- but you only got 3 sections). You also only get one scoop of ice cream. The mix between hot and cold is something new and it was very good.   On my second visit to the place when it was officially opened, the place was more packed. I was told the only ice cream they had was earl grey and I had no choice but to pick it because I wanted their hot plate. Our plates came and near the end, I saw another table get their hot plate but they had different flavors of ice cream.  Overall, I would come here if I wanted dessert, just because it's really close to my house. But if it wasn't close to my house I don't think I would visit unless I really really really craved it."}
{"text":"Sweet Esc. is okay, the waffles with ice cream is good but overpriced. The toast is hot and good but again, over priced."}
{"text":"Don't see the big appeal of this place. It was just waffle with ice cream on top and very little amounts of brownies and sauce. If you have a sweet tooth like me, go to Demetres. If you don't like super sweet desserts, come here. It's not bad, just okay.  Very little place and they need more tables."}
{"text":"After coming here 2 weekends in a row you'd think I'd give it full starts. But come to think of it, I was just sold on the presentation. The hot plate is a great gimmick but there's such a rush to eat the ice cream before it melts away. The ice cream deserves 4 stars - loved the milk tea flavor. Everything else was mediocre. Not much taste to the matcha cream and waffle."}
{"text":"It was nice. Good service. Nice cafe vibe. Great decor. We ordered the build your own waffle with jasmine Macha ice cream, seasonal fruit, brownie bite, green tea cream sauce ($10) and chicken and waffle ($12). The portion sizes are small for the price. When you make waffles, they normally are sectioned into quarters. Our orders only had 3/4 of the whole round waffle mold. The waffles aren't very big either. The waffles themselves were good but nothing special.  I generally like the build your own (flavour wise). They were just very frugal with the toppings. There was one scoop of ice cream, 4 pieces of strawberry (which wouldn't have added up to a full strawberry), and 6 pieces of cinnamon banana (again, would not have made up a full banana). There also want much brownie bits either. The combination of everything was good and I would eat it again if I didn't have to pay for it.   The chicken and waffles was fine as well but I wouldn't recommend. The chicken was bite sized popcorn chicken like. Overall, it was crisp and not too dry but didn't really pair with the waffle. It was also served with gravy that you can pour on. The gravy was  on the blander side and I could see it wasn't a homogeneous mixture. I think they microwaved it because i could hear the ding and the sound when you open a microwave. The also looked like it had been reheated.  I know this cafe wants to be fancy by serving the food on a hot plate but it was really unnecessary. It kind of made things worse. It would dry the sauces very quickly and the brownies stuck to the surface. For something like the build you own, it's meant to be served cold so it doesn't make sense to have it on the hot plate.   I wouldn't mind coming back but I would prefer to explore other cafes."}
{"text":"Decided to try this place with my friends earlier tonight. This tiny place has very good dessert. I had the hot plate with waffles and ice cream, first thing I noticed was this place was very simple in design. But their dessert is good where I can taste the matcha flavour in the ice cream instead of other makes. Also the waffle isn't too doughy. Wish they will increase the topic choices. Aside from that, this place is worth a try."}
{"text":"I wasn't expecting much when my friends and I first pulled up to Sweet Esc, but I must say I was very impressed. Sweet Esc is a super cute little cafe. There is not much seating but the interior feels cozy and inviting. The menu is also really well done.  I ordered the hot Milk Tea and the S'mores toast. It was so so so so good. It was definitely rich, and I couldn't finish it, but it was so worth it.  My friends ordered the Waffle hot plate with Matcha Ice cream and the Matcha Toast Mountain. It's awesome that all of the ice cream is home made and comes in unique flavours. The Matcha Toast Mountain was good, but we think that the S'mores toast was better. The waffle hot plate was also good, but my friends think that the 'hot' plate was not necessary as it made the ice cream melt.  I will definitely be back here in the future. This is a must try!"}
{"text":"Interior is bright and modern. However they don't display the food and you can only rely on the images from their menu. At the end the fruit tart is definitely out of expectations!"}
{"text":"A really great earl grey icecream with brownie on a hot plate... i really enjoyed! Service was attentive, place is very cozy and nice decor. Love the clock wall! Finally they have the book menu, when i went last year, they only have paper menu to order. Now they upgraded the menu list which is great! Definitely recommended!"}
{"text":"Went on a friday night and had to wait about 5-10 minutes.  We tried the pumpkin spice ice cream with waffles (they also had a few other interesting ice cream flavor including an earl grey flavor).  The hot plate was interesting and the experience was worth trying at least once.  The service was good and while the environment was nothing luxury, it was quite a relaxing place."}
{"text":"Small little dessert store with limited seating. We were lucky to have the last seats. They didnt have the milk tea ice cream which is something I really wanted to try. I guess I'll have to go again another time to try it. I would only come here for their flavours of ice cream really that isn't available elsewhere . Nothing else wowed me but it's a nice and clean place to sit down to just chat with one other friend."}
{"text":"I saw a lot of the desserts here through social media and thought I'd give it a try. It's a really cute restaurant with awesome service. I had the \"build your own\" Belgian waffle with green tea cream, two scoops of ice cream (earl grey and eggnog), toppings of seasonal fruit (which is pineapples and kiwis right now), and marshmallows. The waffle comes to you on a very hot plate where you pour the cream on to sizzle. Pouring it was probably the coolest part of the experience. The waffle tasted good, but not great. I probably wouldn't get this again, but would come back to try some of the tarts, cakes, and other ice cream flavours though.   Note: I went around 9PM on a Saturday night and was able to get a seat right away. However, about half an hour later, there was a line with a 45min - 1hr wait. I would recommend going earlier if you don't want to wait!"}
{"text":"Solid 3 star dessert cafe. I was in the mood for dessert and found this place on yelp since it was near me. It was a little hard to actually find this cafe in the plaza because it was night time and their store sign doesn't light up, but luckily we found parking right in front as someone was leaving. Warning - there's a lot of stores in this plaza so you might have a hard time finding parking.  It's a very small cafe - with maybe 10 or so tables. There was only 2 other groups when my boyfriend and I got there so we were able to sit wherever we wanted, but it got jam packed during the 30 minutes we're eating! Come before 9pm on weekends! Very cute atmosphere and comfy chairs.  We were served a glass of water, but you have to flag down the waiter when you want to order (eye contact is not enough). We got the hot plate with Belgian waffles, earl grey ice cream, cinnamon crunch and brownie bits, and green tea sauce ($10 + tax). It was good - nothing truly amazing. Pour the sauce on your waffle as the hot plate will burn it easily. We also got the sweet cheese toast on our way out ($7.50 + tax). Both were okay - definitely worth a try if you're craving something sweet, but I don't think I'll come again."}
{"text":"I honestly love this place. I've only came to this place twice and I throughly enjoyed my experiences.  Service: The waitress is very sweet. She asks if anyone has allergies or dietary restrictions after you order. She also informs us that the hotplates we order are very hot and warns us not to touch them.   Food: Everytime I visit I always go for the hotplates you create yourself. They have a list of store made ice creams that are made daily you can add to your hotplates. They also have a savoury menu now that I have yet to try! But from what I remember there were waffles with popcorn chicken and gravy.  Overall, I would definitely return. The prices are reasonable and the food is nice."}
{"text":"A little hole in the wall in a pretty lit spot in Markham. I've always seen Sweet Esc appearing from time-to-time in my Instagram feed. Finally decided to try it, and I found the place quite cute. It offers a quiet ambiance both times that I have went (around 7 - 8 pm) and I find the decorations and layout aesthetically pleasing. Their ice cream was really good and offered a really strong flavor, but their snacks were what you would typically expect. Pretty cute place to get some insta-worthy pictures, or if you're looking for a quiet place to chill at.   TL;DR: Ice cream is good, snacks are a bit better than the average dessert place. The place offers some insta-worthy pictures though.   Food (3.5/5):  The ice cream is really flavorful. You can tell that every spoon has some consistency to it, and was not prepared half-assed. I also had the cheesy corn and the chicken waffle while I was there. Being a cheese-lover, I couldn't really complain about the corn, but the chicken waffle was so-so in my opinion. The chicken was a bit burnt and you could taste the bitterness of the char, although it was not significant enough to overpower the flavor of the waffle and syrup.   As for ice cream, I would recommend the Earl Grey or the Milk Tea.   Service (4/5):  Both times that I went, the place was not really packed. Other than us, there were maybe 1 - 2 other groups. This made service pretty good, and better than some other places that are a bit more packed. No complaints with the waiters either.  -------- Overall (3.5 - 4/5)"}
{"text":"Tried it when they first opened and it was a disappointment. There weren't anything special that they sold."}
{"text":"Don't really understand what all the hype is about. Nothing special with the waffle and ice cream. Overpriced and so-so service. Wouldn't recommend. I would rather go Pastel."}
{"text":"Let me just start by saying I've never written a review right after leaving the place. But today, I experienced probably the worst service ever.   I've been here multiple times and I love their waffles. But this waitress was sooooo rude you can't even imagine.  1. There were a lot of empty tables and she sat me and my boyfriend in a two person table in the corner of the restaurant, where you are not able to see the 'menu board' they have. Keep in mind there were plenty of empty tables.  2. When I asked what seasonal ice cream was available today, she told me to come to the menu board and look for myself.. I'm sorry but is this my restaurant or yours? I'm not one for needing the best of services but I do want respect.   3. Remember all those empty tables? So two of her friends came in and she sat them at the table for four, where the door wasn't close to and wind was coming in constantly. I can see that what because I don't know you I don't get the same service as someone else.   Overall I'll probably never come back, even though the waffles are good. The waitress was Asian probably Chinese, wear big over sized raybans and has black hair I know describes majority of Asians."}
{"text":"Sweet ESC is a great place to not only have creative and unique desserts, but great tasting desserts.   Came here shortly after three on a weekday and it was nice and quiet. I did enjoy the place a lot. It was clean and there was lots of natural lighting. Great place to catch up/hangout with friends while enjoying desserts.  They do have a changing menu for both ice cream, teas, and more so that's great to see. I would love to come back to try more unique offerings! We ordered the mango based green tea to compliment our desserts and honesty, it was pretty average. The flavour is limited to the first two cups and tasted like normal tea. But I did enjoy it and it was nice to have to pair with the desserts so I do recommend getting a tea. The waitress did check in with us and filled up our pot multiple times.   For the sizzling plate dessert, we got the brownie, earl grey ice cream and chocolate cookie bits with a matcha sauce. Sure the hot plate might seem like a novelty but it was fun to see and enjoy. It's no different than putting candles on a cake. But I would argue it was nice to have warm dessert (especially the brownie). I really did enjoy this dessert, each of the components were well done and could be sold separately and I would buy it. The brownie was excellent, it was moist and chocolaty. The ice cream was awesome and matcha just seems to make all desserts better!   Lastly, the blueberry tart was good as well. I love blueberries and like the fact it wasn't overly sweet. The blueberries were plump, the crust was crisp. All in all, a great tart."}
{"text":"This is such a cute little desert place. I ordered the earl grey ice cream on waffle with fresh mixed fruits and chocolate sauce. It was only $8plus tax which is a reasonable price. I loved the early grey ice cream, it tasted amazing and wasn't too sweet. This is a great desert place to go with friends and chat amongst some desert! The only problem is that there is limited seating, so sometimes you have to wait but other than that, it's great!"}
{"text":"Hot sizzling plate is for show and honestly doesn't do much for flavour.  The ice cream here is bomb (coffee milk tea and earl grey so good) but the ratio to waffle is a bit off.  The toast though is AMAZING.  Had the roasted marshmallow and I would order it again in a heartbeat."}
{"text":"It's a cute place to enjoy desserts around the Warden/Steeles plaza! The concept is definitely unique, where you customize a base (waffles/brownie) + cream (chocolate/vanilla/matcha that you pour on the dessert) + toppings (nuts/fruits/cookie/brownie/marshmallows etc.) + housemade icecream (eggnog, mint fudge maple, and earl grey are some of the more unique ones) on a sizzling hot plate for $8.50. Try the earl grey icecream. It's extremely tasty!   For maximal tasting enjoyment, I recommend actually just using the hot plate to heat up solely the base/toppings so that the cream doesn't go to waste by drying up on the plate. Also don't let the icecream touch the plate and have it melt into an inedible puddle! When you eat it you should taste the temperature difference of the base and icecream this way. The waffle holes were good pockets to hold the cream.  There are also other desserts to choose from that don't require customization. The server was respectful, friendly, sociable, and informative."}
{"text":"Came here on a Friday night and there were about 2 tables available. Its a small brightly light place, felt cozy for sure. The waitress was very nice, she explained to us the menu and how to build your own hot plate waffle works.   I got the green tea sauce, with brownies and the coffee milk tea ice cream. ( I originally wanted early grey tea ice cream but they were sold out for the day). The hot plate is definitely fun, when your pour the sauce you see and hear it sizzle, everyone was definitely taking pics when the food arrives. its great that it also keeps your waffle really warm and toasty.   The sauce itself didn't taste like much but was needed to moisten the waffle. The ice cream itself was good but not amazing, the brownies also fell kinda flat and again felt tasteless. The portions were big and I was quite full for about $9.   I may or may not come back just because of the close location, but it just don't feel compelled to. It was good just not great."}
{"text":"I ordered the Belgian waffle on a hot plate. I chose the Earl Grey ice cream, seasonal fruits and cookie chunks for toppings and vanilla sauce. The Earl Grey ice cream had a good amount of flavour. My strawberries and pineapples were so sour I didn't even want to finish them and the cookie chunks felt like it was a Christie cookie broken up and thrown on top. First time I've been there and probably the last, was not impressed."}
{"text":"I don't get the rave about this place. Came here for the first time with a friend around 10:30pm..ordered the waffle on a hot plate (which is not unique, but rather stupid!! who puts ice cream on a hot plate to just melt and turn into soup?) with earl grey ice cream which was good. Waited 40 minutes for our dessert to come AND was served after a couple that came in about 10 minutes after us. My friend ordered the waffle with coffee milk tea ice cream which was okay, nothing special but with CEREAL on top that got stuck to the hot plate as well lol. Definitely first and last visit!"}
{"text":"always felt there was a lack of dessert places in the area so I was rejoiced to see one finally opened up in the area of Warden and Steeles.. stumbled on this place by accident, after my outing @ Chatime but felt I still needed some dessert. didn't even noticed this place till I look up at the sign and was like.. ohh that is a new dessert place and not another one of those escape place haha... no one was inside except the two young workers.  but still decided to try it anyway.  Didn't know this place opened for two months already.. their official grand opening is in a week: June 27th.  Tried their special hot plate dessert.. it was nice - loved the unique ice cream choices that comes with it... for $8 for the hot plate.. may be a little pricey as it was nothing too special.. I was too full to try their other desserts but will come back for another visit    place is not very bigl..maybe can fit one to three big groups. I like though atm that it is quiet .. good place to have conversations and meetings.. washrooms are inside the mall (not that far to the rite)."}
{"text":"This place is lit fam. First, not many places do hot plates, and the ones that do, don't do it good. So this is where this place takes the cake, or the hot plate.  What I also love about this place is pretty much everything is made by them, even their ice creams.  The place is neat, cozy and cute. It has a more intimate vibe in contrast to demetre's or other upbeat dessert places.  We had Brownie hot plate with Earl gray ice cream and nuts. I was kinda weirded out when i heard about the flavour but the taste took me by surprise. Top it off with some hot tea and that sums up your perfect dessert experience for the night."}
{"text":"I saw many pictures of their signature dish on instagram and I just had to try it out! I walked in and was immediately greeted and seated by a lovely waitress. She also told us that the waffles were extra big today which was great to know!  I had the hot plate - belgian waffle, earlgrey icecream, topped off with vanilla cream sauce and brownie bits. The dessert was very unique; they give you a 400 C hotplate with a small jug of sauce and you pour the sauce over the waffles. I accidently poured alot of the sauce on the hotplate since I wanted to see the sizzling but try to pour more onto the waffles themselves. Really, the hotplate doesn't provide much to the desert itself other than the presentation and uniqueness of seeing the sizzling waffle. Nonetheless, the dessert was delicious - not extremely sweet and the waffle was crispy on the outside and fluffy on the inside. The earl grey icecream is also not too sweet and has a strong flavor. All in all, everything was enjoyable.  The only thing is that the prices are a little bit expensive, but its definitely a dessert worth trying once."}
{"text":"For new this place by searching on Yelp! The place was small and cozy! Interesting concept for desserts. Customer service was great I suggested to my friends to check it out and they loved it as well... As this place gets more popular they might have to expand   I will definitely be coming back again!!"}
{"text":"I love waffles and icecream, so it was obvious I had to try this place once it opened up! It is also only a three minute drive from my house. I adore their coffee milktea and earl grey icecream. Their waffle is just average but the icecream makes up for it. The whole hotplate waffle idea is a gimmick but I have to admit their waffle tastes good with their icecream, with or without the hotplate."}
{"text":"Brightly lit coffee & tea joint catering to the younger crowd.  They have a nice selection of tea, coffee, waffles and homemade ice cream.  I was looking for a spot to sit down and catch up with a friend and came across Sweet Esc on Yelp.  There were plenty of people there on Friday night and I was happy to see that there was an empty table.  Instead of being greeted upon arrival and told to help ourselves to the table, the waitress just asked us to wait.  Another minute or two passed before she decided she can bring us to our table.  I am sorry, but the waitress was sweet but she was a little bit clueless.  I literally have to repeat my order three times, when all I ordered was one item.  While the price for drinks are reasonable, I find the menu price for waffles and other dessert was a little overpriced.  They have several interesting ice cream flavors listed on the board, but unfortunately, they do not offer incentives for people to get double/triple scoop.  I was shocked when waitress told me that it is $3.50 per scoop.  Meaning, I would have to pay $7 for 2 scoops and $10.50 for 3 scoops of ice cream.  Hmm...  Cute little coffee and tea joint, but perhaps I am just getting too old for these kind of places."}
{"text":"Loved the desserts and the incredibly comfy chairs.  We ordered the s'mores thick toast, homemade coffee milk ice cream and Ovaltine Dino drink.  Quite impressed by it all! The s'mores had just the right amount of Nutella. Coffee ice cream had light but distinguishable coffee taste. Dino is sth new to me, I wanted Horlicks but it's currently replaced with Ovaltine for now. Very refreshing and not too much ice in the drink. The service was A+, and hopefully not because we came in shortly after it opened for the day.  Will definitely be back to try the hotplate dessert one day."}
{"text":"My friend recommended Sweet Esc for our GNO after dinner dessert session.  Sweet Esc is a boutique sized dessert place with a cute and simple interior.   Note that they have really heavy chairs haha. My friend and I were surprised by how heavy they are when we were getting seated. It's probably a good thing - you eat all the calories, then you burn a bit by just moving their chairs LOL.  Both of us ordered from the \"Create your plate\" menu.  My order was: (4/5) * BELGIAN WAFFLES * Chocolate Cream * White Miso Ginger Ice Cream * Cinnamon Crunch  This was so yummy!! I loved my combination and I would recommend it - BUT, change the ice cream to EARL GREY ICE CREAM. I tried my friend's and thought it tasted better than my ginger one."}
{"text":"This place has the best service, the guy always looked out for his guests and he was the only one serving. I left him a 30% tip just because you can tell he works hard. The food was so good, the icecream tasted like froot loops not even gonna lie. I recommend this place 110%."}
{"text":"I'm in this area quite often and have never noticed this little dessert shop. It's more of a sit-down place rather than grab-and-go. There's a full menu for you to browse, but I was expecting a few more classic desserts. Sweet Esc definitely only offers specialty items.   I opted for the hot plate with a waffle base, coffee milk tea ice cream, vanilla cream, and cookie bit toppings for $8.50. I love that you can pour the cream yourself and watch it sizzle on the plate - something I've never experienced. It tasted phenomenal, so I would love to try other flavour combinations. I'm not sure how often they rotate ice cream flavours, but they only offered four relatively unique flavours while we were there, so I would've preferred some classics in the mix such as vanilla or chocolate.   The shop is spacious, and we were the only customers at around 8pm on Sunday evening. Service was great, and they allowed us to stay chatting for quite a while. A great hangout location!"}
{"text":"3.5 -- Sweet Esc is located in a strip plaza, has lovely modern decor and has these sizzle plates for waffles and ice cream. Stopped by on a Friday night around 9pm and was able to grab a table for 2. This dessert spot is fairly small so coming in with groups larger than 4 maybe a challenge. We ordered a customized sizzle plate where you can choose waffle or crepe, your ice cream and additional toppings. The waffle was light and fluffy and had a great crust however their ice cream was delicious. Very unique flavors such as HK tea, earl grey or matcha. This concept of a sizzle plate would seem like a good idea however the ice cream i found melted way to fast on this sizzle plate and would force you to eat the dessert way faster than needed. However I can see that this is a different concept and I can appreciate that."}
{"text":"Still opening for now, but amazing so far! Currently the menu is limited, but they will expand to further options (shown on the website) Also! Everything is baked fresh EACH MORNING! Note: Cash only! (until further notice)  ~Foods~ Lemon Tart: Beautiful creaminess with a perfect blend of sweet and tartness.  Topped with whipped cream that has been blazed.   Coconut Tart: Delicious filling with a semi-sweet flavour.  Not overpowering in the coconut flavour but it certainly enhances the experience dramatically.  Belgian Waffle with Vanilla Ice Cream, Chocolate Cream Sauce, and Mixed Nuts on a hotplate: This is by far the best dish they have to offer.  You have your choice of either slices of belgian waffles or brownies, with a choice of ice cream flavour, topped with a number of various toppings and given either chocolate or vanilla cream sauce to drizzle on top.  The hotplate keep the base food warm while eating it with the ice cream to get a continuous contrasting experience.  It works amazingly! The chocolate and vanilla cream sauce has incredible consistency and is neither thick like chocolate sauce, nor being too light as whipped cream.  S'mores Brick Toast: My personal favourite since I LOVE sweet food! This is two slices of brick toast topped with Marshmallows, chocolate sauce, and with Nutella.  The roasted marshmallow's stickiness combines amazingly with the chewy brick toast.  For those that like it harder, the crust gives a decent crunch but isn't impossible to bite down on.  Warning! This is a very sticky dish. But it wouldn't be s'mores if it weren't sticky and messy!  Pomegranate Lemonade Tea: Lovely fruit combination! It's lemonade tea with pomegranate syrup at the bottom (or so it seems).  You are able to stir it yourself which provides a fun little experience. (I suggest using the lemon wedge provided to help mix it).  It's a light drink that goes nicely with all the heavy pastries.  ~Atmosphere~ A cute little place with pleasant music. Certainly not overwhelming and won't get on anybody's nerves.  A wonderful place to go on a date or just to sit down and read a book while enjoying some tea.  As of right now it is decorated rather lightly, but I think it provides a beautiful space for the mind to create its own world.  Absolutely would recommend it as a place to go for anyone reading an exciting book or writing a novel.  ~Service~ Pleasant employees with smiles on their faces.  Very welcoming and they take the time to explain the dishes to you.  We came as a group of seven people and ordered fourteen items.  Every single one of them came as ordered and did not take very long.  Approximately three to ten minutes waiting time depending on what you ordered.  For us there was always a server available and they attentive enough to ask us how things were going periodically.  Helped us to refill our hot water for our tea as well.   ~JJL"}
{"text":"I love the idea of hot plate waffles!  Keeps the waffles nice and toasty. Except melted the ice cream on top quicker than we were able to consume it. Really enjoyed the ice cream though.  We had Earl Grey and the coffee milk tea flavour!   Their grapefruit lemonade was a surprise, in a good way! We had to order another one after trying it :)"}
{"text":"Got the cheese corn hotplate which was a lil spicy. It came with toast. My friend got the waffle hotplate which he says was good but the portion was a bit small. An average place. But they have cool ice cream flavours (e.g. vanilla cardamom, jasmine matcha, milo, earl grey, oolong, etc.)!"}
{"text":"Very cute and minimalists concept and design of the shop. Extremely cute and simple. Their service was all very nice and genuine.  Every time I've been there, I always get their \"build it yourself\" hot plate. Waffles are extremely well made and super fluffy when eating. However, their specialty is definitely the homemade ice cream that is added on top. The unique flavours such as earl grey, vanilla cardamom, oolong etc, all tasted really good and complimented the waffles well.  The hot plate also gave an option to pair it with brownies instead of waffles. The brownies are on the rather sweet side which is normal as they are generally pretty sweet."}
{"text":"It's a small little store in a strip mall.  I had the hot Plate Ice Cream with Brownie and Words can't describe how good this was. We chose our ice cream (they have a very nice mix of interesting ice cream- I believe they make it themselves), followed by the choice of brownie or waffles, then our toppings (we chose fruits and cookies), and last but not least our sauce. It's amazing trust us !!!  Very calming place. There's just 2 people working so you might need to be a bit patient when there's a lot of people.  Seating is limited probably like 6 tables."}
{"text":"Uhmazing house made icecreams! Personal fave is coffee milk tea and cardamom vanilla. Super nice staff, seriously they're really nice. Cute, clean interior with a calm atmosphere. It's on the smaller side, not too much seating.  They only have brewed coffee though if you're looking for a more extensive coffee/espresso menu."}
{"text":"How to start... I've been frequenting Sweet Esc for a while now, closer to when it was still fairly new. I feel like I've seen it go through a lot of changes - from going from just hot plates, to the introduction of a full menu with savory items and cakes/tarts/toasts, having the vicinity card (and then not), working with local artists and displaying their work, live music nights, and now going from a full-service cafe to an ice cream parlour geared towards takeout. The only thing that has stayed the same is the music (mostly Youtube artists and covers).  Perhaps I'm speaking from a place of nostalgia, but the change is quite drastic actually. I do think their menu was a bit bloated before, so I don't think it's a bad change. They've taken everything out of the menu and expanded their ice cream flavors. I always found their ice creams to be the best thing there, so I'm actually glad there's more variety.They use egg now and it's creamier than before; flavour-wise I'm still partial to the original tea ones that they had in the first place like earl grey and oolong. I quite like the pandan, which is new!  They've added specialty drinks (i.e. very instagrammable hot chocolates with chocolate bars on top and such). Personally, the three or four times I've been there since the change, I've never seen anyone order one of these drinks. They seem to be bringing small things back though - last time we went, we were able to get a cookie when before, they were not available. One of the staff said that they were thinking about bringing the hot plates back, but take this with a grain of salt - this was not the owner speaking, and I've seen no indication of any sort that this is true. For now, it is really just ice cream.  What I miss most is the atmosphere. I used to want to stay here all the time and it was very cozy and comfortable. There was table space to do work, now they've changed the seating to just single tables for two (and they are small tables - two laptops will not fit). There is a set of two tables at the back, but it's always taken (because of course you'd want more space). They are definitely focusing on the takeout aspect as this place is not group-friendly anymore. There used to be two or three tables by the window that could seat six, now it's empty save for a table where you can fill your own water (which I haven't seen anyone really do, since they don't stay for long). People notice - once when I was there we saw three separate parties come in thinking that the hot plates were still there and then leaving afterwards.  I totally understand the change. Everything is much more streamlined - before you would need staff making waffles and brownies and savory things in the back, making ice cream if needed, people to fill water and take orders and serve... now it is much simpler. Even the chalkboard menu is gone as it no longer needs updating - just clipboards with the ice cream flavors on coloured paper. No more people waiting in the front, either. Oh, and no more washing plates and cutlery either. Ice cream comes in paper cups or cones. Financially, these changes make total sense, so I completely understand... but something has been lost in the process, I feel.  The changes make sense. However, the staff now don't seem to quite know what to do with themselves. Before, they had things to do (and were a little understaffed at peak times). Now they literally just stand there and wait for people to order ice cream (which as you can tell, is not a lot right now as we are only just heading into spring). I'm really curious what will happen come summer - this plaza does not have the foot traffic, accessibility of transit, or the parking space for people to be coming regularly to get ice cream and only ice cream. What Sweet Esc does have going for it still is that its flavours are truly quite unique.   As someone has mentioned already, the staff also don't seem to make you feel very welcome, even if it isn't their intention. They don't really look like they really want to be there and are probably bored as hell too. One person was kind of robotic when we asked about the specifics of the flavours. I know it's hard when you're not actually the owner of a place, but I would hope that they would hire people who at least sound like they like the food being served. I think some people are also new-ish as one was a bit confused about our ice cream order. The old staff felt friendlier and we would actually even feel comfortable chatting and asking questions when they had some time. I also loved looking at the work of local artists and writers too - it gave Sweet Esc the kind of community vibe that you only really get downtown.  I'll still come here - I'm just sad that it doesn't feel as warm as it used to.   One last thing - I also miss the dried flowers and little plants that were in mason jars on the tables. And the beautiful photography in the old menu. It's the details that matter."}
{"text":"I visited yesterday with my friend for the first time, and it was a really pleasant experience. To start off, we ordered the hot plate -- a  brownie topped with chocolate sauce, coffee milk tea ice cream and fresh fruit. The brownie was warmed by the hot plate and had a great texture, and the ice cream was probably one of the best I've ever had. I do wish they sold it in tubs, but we were told that everything is completely hand made so I understand that this would be quite challenging. We sat and talked for a while before ordering a second hot plate, but our server Kelvin kept refilling our drinks and checked up on us regularly (we were never rushed or felt unwelcome). He was very friendly, easy-going, and helpful -- the epitome of good service! On our second hot plate, we ordered a waffle with earl grey ice cream, green tea sauce and roasted nuts. The ice cream was definitely the highlight, and the nuts were a nice touch (recommended by Kelvin) because they would continue roasting on the hot plate and release a nice aroma. The two plates along with my earl grey caramel tea and my friend's coffee came up to be $27, which isn't bad considering how great everything was. All in all, my friend and I had a fantastic experience at Sweet Esc and we will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"Came here with low expectations after looking at all the pics uploaded. I just couldn't find anything I wanted to have but I still had to go out of curiosity. The place is quite small. The menu is limited to tarts, waffles and toast with a few drink selections.  Tried the milk and honey toast mountain $8.50 - its basically bread soaked with honey and topped with condesnsed milk, strawberries and a scoop of ice cream. I had all these ingredience at home and I'm sure I could have slapped this together myself. It was a bit on the sweet side for me with all the honey they used. Portion is quite large with all the bread it comes with. I found myself forcing it down just to finish it. At the end it just felt like I was eating honey toast.  Also got a chance to try the waffle with brownie topped with ice cream for $8.50 - Its served on a hotplate and they poured vanilla cream on the waffle to top it off which made the hotplate sizzle. Thats the most excitement your gonna get outta this place. It tasted okay.  Also tried an iced peach lemonade drink $3.50 - couldn't taste the lemon part of it. It was more of a sweet peach drink.   Overall, decent at best and the selection of desserts are nothing to get excited about. Service was good at least."}
{"text":"Amazing deal for $10. Great friendly environment and the dessert is all fresh and homemade.  I will definitely be returning soon!"}
{"text":"The good: ice cream are all homemade. The good ones imo are coffee milk tea (yummmmy!) and vanilla cardamom. However...  The bad: not a huge fan of the pastry. :/ it does get a tad pricey (especially when you want to try everything!).   The ugly: nothing too bad here.  Neutral: I was indifferent about the earl grey ice cream, the matcha wasn't too bad as well. The place has good lighting. Great for dates, good for groups of four, not more than though (not enough space to fit)."}
{"text":"Their hot plate dessert menu is alright; they have a small amount of items to customize your dessert. Staff are super friendly. It's a small place with few seating so it does get busy! Decor is simple and minimal and clean. Just a tip, if you get the brownie on a hot plate part of it ends up sticking on the plate."}
{"text":"I really enjoy being able to get a waffle late at night!  Staff: They are very friendly and explained how the menu worked. I think this is top notch in terms of service and getting our food in a timely manner.  Ambience: It is small but brightly lit. They have a chalk board with their ice cream flavours and specials. And while I am fine with the chalkboard having information, we couldn't see it because were seated around the corner. I wish the had it on the other wall or on the table (maybe as a whiteboard card or something?). I had to stand up and walk over a few times which was definitely cumbersome.  Food: I got their hot plate waffle with earl grey ice cream. On the surface, I think the hot plate adds nothing, but if I think about it, it may have kept the waffle warm and toasty, since ice cream could make the waffle cold and soggy. I'm not sure how much of that is true though. The waffle was very nice, but I didn't care too much for the ice cream. I'm a kid who likes basic flavours and Sweet Esc offers anything but.  I do like it and want to go back again soon!"}
{"text":"Tried one of their ice cream waffles, but I agree another reviewer, the hot plate is a gimmick.  The waffles are nothing special and neither is the ice cream. I suppose there's novelty in being able to customize your plate with the ice cream and toppings you want. But they're all about average.  Maybe a good place to bring a date but I wouldn't come here again."}
{"text":"Second time coming here since they opened, thought I'd give it another try. I ordered the strawberrylime soda, Belgium waffle with coffee milk tea on sizzling plate, and matcha mountain (toast mountain). The place was empty when I got there (around 4 pm on a Thursday). Originally I was going to order another drink but I saw that they were pouring cream soda from a bottle into the strawberrylime soda drink I ordered, so I didn't. The waffles were great! I wish the coffee milk tea icecream wasn't so overpowering. It had a strong taste of coffee, which was all I could taste. The matcha toast mountain was delicious! I love love love the matcha icecream so much! It was smaller than I expected since it does cost $9 but it was great!"}
{"text":"Don't know why it took so many visits for me to realize that I haven't checked in or wrote a review for this Gem of a place yet. The ambience is so cute. Great for dates and cute last minute dessert trip. The decor is elegant and lots light so those of you who love taking pictures of your food... this is the spot. The place usually is packed depending on the time and day but can never really guess the flow of customers since it's pretty random every time I visit.   Menu:  * they make their own ice cream! it is totally worth breaking your diet for. You can also purchase tubs of their ice cream to bring home as well. $12/tub or $20/2 tubs  *They serve tea, coffee and soda drinks as well.  All the tea is very light and goes fantastic with their desserts.  *Fruits tarts, savoury brick toast and dessert brick toasts are also included on the menu as well. But i would recommend the HOT PLATE desserts. Have yet to find another place that serves hot plate waffle.  Hot waffle plates $10 (also comes with brownies if you don't want waffle):  I ordered a belgian waffle topped with EARL GREY (one of their best flavours) ice-cream, seasonal fruits (you get 2 toppings but i just doubled the fruits) and with a vanilla cream to drizzle over with. The waffle is pretty much like any good standard waffle but it's the toppings and the hot plate that makes it unique and amazing. The plate it's served on is 400 degrees! imagine the fruits being grilled on that! it's a pretty interesting feeling to have hot fruits and ice cream together in your mouth. The sensation is hard to describe lol.   Kimchi pork belly toast $10:  braised and marinated pork belly on top of kimchi and toast. There's a sauce they included in between the pork and the kimchi that ties it all together. I want to say it's mayo but honestly, i can't tell what it is... my taste buds usually have a pretty good idea of what is in the food thats served to me but i guess i  was too busy enjoying the taste and the presentation of it all."}
{"text":"3.5 stars  Came with a friend for dessert. Cute, small. We got there near closing and so a lot if things were sold out  I tried the fruit tart...was not my cup of tea.  It looked pretty though...but the fruits were sour and the tart was tough.   My friend's s'mores waffle ...was supposed to be a toast but they ran out...looked really pretty. She enjoyed it. The server was cool and ensured that we were aware that they were out of toasts and set expectation of the portion size of the waffle"}
{"text":"Satisfactory place for dessert. The hot plates with waffles were good, not extraordinary. I got Belgian waffles with earl grey ice cream and chocolate sauce (am i the only one who thinks the chocolate sauce is just melted chocolate ice cream?). I do not recommend the blueberry tart. There was nothing special about it, and definitely not worth the price."}
{"text":"Come late. They were out of waffle batter. Need to try again. But still ordered their hot plate with brownies, jasmine matcha ice cream, strawberries, brownie bites, and to top it off, vanilla cream sauce. This was good but still need to try the waffle."}
{"text":"I'm not sure when Sweet Esc revamped to be an ice-cream store (they used to serve hot plate waffles & brownies and toasts), so I was surprised when I visited. They still serve beverages such as hot tea.   I was always a big fan of their earl grey ice-cream, and I'm happy it's still on the menu! There are a lot of different and unique flavours such as milo, coffee milk tea, guava sorbet and pandan coconut. I've tried the guava sorbet and milo ice-cream recently. The guava sorbet is lighter and refreshing, and milo was very rich in flavour. Haven't had a chance to try all the flavours yet, but I would recommend earl grey and milo! If you're unsure of what to order, you can ask to try the flavours.   All in all, would I come back? Sweet Esc is definitely a place to visit if you're craving for some speciality ice-cream (especially earl grey :p)."}
{"text":"I was extremely heart broken when I learned my favourite dessert place because a takeout ice cream parlour. ***YES, they have became a boutique Baskin Robbins*** Good memories and prejudice aside, they are still an excellent small business with wonderful products. My boyfriend and I came on a Saturday afternoon, it was quiet and we were the only customers. They have a wall of all the flavours, all of which are very unique like Pandan Coconut, Milo, Oolong and Guava Sorbet.  Owner was polite and patient and let us tried multiple flavours before ordering.  We ended up getting Pandan Coconut, Oolong and Earl Grey. All of them were smooth and creamy. Each flavour taste exactly like how it's advertised.  I was particularly impressed by the contrast they were able to make between Earl Grey and Oolong, since tea flavoured ice cream often doesn't translate well and you end up with faint hints of the teas. Oolong was nice and light, and it tasted like a milk tea. Their classic Earl Grey had beautiful floral notes that was not overpowering. The Pandan Coconut was neon green (LOL) but was also delicious. You very clearly taste the pandan leaf, which compliments so well with the rich coconut. It was nice seeing a Southeast Asian classic flavour combo in ice cream form. I am very happy with their ice cream and love their water station at the side - so thoughtful. I would love to come again."}
{"text":"I selected a 1 star rating because there isn't a zero rating. I would never come back or recommend anyone to go to the Markham location. Service was slow. There was no cream for the coffee.  We had to go to the front to pick the tea we wanted.  Then was told 10 min later there wasn't any of the tea we wanted left. It was an all around bad experience."}
{"text":"Came here last night with a girlfriend I hadn't seen in almost a year to catch up. We ordered two waffle plate specials. The food was ok - ice cream flavors were hit or miss. The earl grey ice cream was great but the chocolate ginger just tasted like chocolate.  The service is just awful. We were rushed from the moment we sat down. There wasn't a line waiting for tables either so I have no idea the server was in such a rush. She came to check on us twice within five minutes to order. She came again to see if we were finished eating in half an hour. Then again after five minutes when we told her we were still working on it. As soon as we were finished eating, she brought the bill with the machine in her hands.  If there were people waiting for a table, we would've understood. But there was nobody waiting so I have no idea why she had rushed us to leave. We spent an hour at sweet esc, not an unusual amount of time for dessert/snacks.   Confused, we left and finished our conversation in her car. Strange place and service. I definitely won't be going back with company any time soon or recommending it to friends."}
{"text":"This place is great! Some of the best ice cream in town. They have a ton of flavors and recently re-organized and don't have hot plates. The tea flavors of ice cream are by far my favourite. You definitely need to come try this place out! (They have wifi auto +1, pokemon life)"}
{"text":"Been coming to this center a lot of Chatime and decided to give this place a try. The person work there was NOT happy we came in. There are no pictures and she wasn't willing to explain anything to us so we just guessed. The ice cream was okay, the half-sammie was a good deal and the cookies are TERRIBLE. I got the toffee snickerdoodle and it tasted like butter (looked like it would taste of toffee or cinnamon but NO) and the lemon butter which tasted like dough.  Wish I could get a refund on my time and money because this is not worth it at all."}
{"text":"*Located in the same plaza with Chatime, which is quite smart as the latter doesn't serve dessert (only some donuts) so Chatime buyers can come to Sweet Esc after buying bubble tea, or vice versa.   *Really small, at best this place can only hold 15 people.    *Apparently they are still in the soft-opening week so menu might change.   *Their main dessert is the hotplate for $7.5. First you have to choose your base (brownie or waffle); ice-cream (vanilla or earl-grey); sauce (chocolate or vanilla) and finally the toppings (fruits, brownie bites, crushed nuts etc). The portion is quite generous for the price.   I ordered the hot-plate with waffle and my friend got the brownie one.   The iron plate is heated until it is boiling hot, then the chef would put the base and all the toppings on top. All you have to do is to pour the sauce around the base and you will start to see some steam and sizzle! I wished there was more variation of fruits and extra fruit pieces. To be honest, while the effect was \"cool,\" I don't understand the purpose of the iron plate.   The waffle wasn't that great, it was too dense and chewy for my taste. Likewise the brownie was just like other brownie I have had. If you ask me, I think the iron-plate should be heated longer so then the heat will cook the bases, and give them a slight crust on the outside. The good thing about these desserts was that all the components weren't too sweet, and the bitter dark chocolate helped to balance the sweetness of the dishes.  *Overall: I would visit again once they have finalized their menu. As the owners are still in the menu-testing phase, there are rooms for improvement in terms of the offerings and quality of the dishes. Also, most items were decently priced for the amount and taste of food, it doesn't hurt to try if you are in the area to grab chatime  :p."}
{"text":"Love the concept of the dessert, unique and fun. But isn't the purpose of going to a dessert place is to have good dessert? Food itself did not live up to the hype, and the price. It was simply not mindblowing, nor great. The brownies, waffles, and icecreams were just average. I would definitely recommend anyone who has never had this type of dessert to try at least once, but for the sole purpose of having delicious dessert, i will not come back again."}
{"text":"The design of this store was pretty simple which was pretty cute.   There were both sweet and savoury items on the menu.  We ordered two hot dessert plates which were pretty cool. They come sizzling with a cup of sauce that you drizzle on top.   The dessert was average. Just the concept of the sizzling plate was cool.   The waffles were soft and warm. Nothing too special. The  brownies were good but a little on the sweeter side. I wasn't able to finish it. Both the early grey and the coffee milk tea ice creams were good."}
{"text":"This is a pretty unique dessert cafe in Markham. You can build your own hotplate w a base (brownie or waffle), add icecream, sauce, cookies, nuts, and fruit for only $10 (might be a bit extra for fruit). The atmosphere is pretty calming, relaxing and the decor is very aesthetic (for y'all artsy instagrammers)!!! 8.5/10 would recommend this place and u must try the earl grey ice cream!!!"}
{"text":"This is a small new restaurant that serves homemade ice cream, waffles and tarts. Visited here on a Sunday evening and it was full. We had to wait a little before being seated.  We tried their tarts and the Belgian waffles served on a hot plate. For $8.75 you get to choose a flavour of their homemade ice cream (Earl Grey was delicious!), two toppings and a flavored cream to pour over the waffles. As others have said, the hot plate doesn't do much and ends up melting your ice cream faster than you need it to.   The tarts were also really good. The crust was crispy and I loved the hint of lemon in their blueberry tart.  For drinks they serve something called a 'Dino'. This was interesting but again wasn't the greatest. It's like a milk tea with loads of powder of Milo or Horlick.  Sweet Esc is a welcome new addition to the growing number of dessert restaurants in Markham!"}
{"text":"This lovely dessert place is one of a kind; definitely not many places like this in the area! We had the blueberry tart as well as the fruit and brown sugar tart - both were amazing and definitely worth trying! To top it off, we got a pot of oolong tea to share! Overall, love the cute and warm atmosphere of this dessert cafe. The lady was super nice and its definitely a great place to go with friends to chat, while enjoying some lovely desserts! Hopefully, in the future they'll be able to expand their menu; would love to try out some new desserts!"}
{"text":"The sizzling waffles with ice cream caught my attention. It was recommended on Yelp saying that it was hot and new. Coming in there's someone greeting you and letting you know where the ice cream options are. The menu is quite nice and simple and it guides you step by step on how to order to make your own hot plate of heaven. Near the entrance behind the cash there's a black board with the ice cream options written on it. They don't have the options on the menu because they rotate flavours. I had the coffee milk tea ice cream with Belgian waffles, seasonal fruits, and hot chocolate sauce poured on the 400 degree sizzling plate. It was nice for the waitress to remind me that it's hot and the temperature of the plate. The icecream had a rich coffee flavour which went very well with the waffles. I didn't find that pineapple and apple tasted well hot or with the flavour of the ice cream. The customer service is nice and the renovations remind me of a coffee shop. It's worth a try and I'll definitely go back to try different options!"}
{"text":"I was eyeing this place for a long time now and finally got to try it today! My friend and I went around 3:30pm and the place was empty. It was a bit awkward because the place was kinda quiet. It was really fancy and cozy in there. We both ordered the special hot plate and enjoyed it! In my opinion I feel like sweet esc it is a one time thing only and you have to try the hot plates. Very happy with my dish!"}
{"text":"Went for the $10 build your own waffle. I ordered the brownie with Thai ice cream. However they messed up my order and gave me waffles instead of brownies. BUT they gave me the brownie on the side. I also asked for two toppings of fruits, but ended up getting the same amount as my friend who asked for fruit and marshmallows. After I appealed to the staff they said it was worth two fruit toppings (even though we have the exact amount if pineapple and strawberries), but whatever! Guess next time I'll get something else.   I enjoyed the Italian soda mango and passion fruit! Even though the waffle tasted good, it's a bit pricey for the amount given.  Overall decent place to go for dessert."}
{"text":"To find the best of the best at Sweet Esc, a certain degree of trial and error must be done.  You'll learn only after trying both whether the brownie or waffle hotplate is better for you. With more than a few ice cream options, only after trying a couple will you find your king of the hill flavour. And only when your sweet tooth gets the best of you, you'll find the perfect amount for you may be a single plate to yourself or a single plate shared.  After many visits I have found the best combination for me. It is the earl grey ice cream on a brownie with matcha sauce and cereal, served with an extra scoop and shared with a loved one. Swoon.  Their ice cream is made in-house and they do custom order cakes and cakelets. Highly recommend this place to locals. My \"second stomach\" reserved for dessert is always empty for Sweet Esc."}
{"text":"Sweet Esc located at the same plaza of Dayali and Warden Chatime. The place is small yet seating are spacious.   I was greeted by friendly staff. She was very friendly and welcomed questions on the menu.   I ordered one of the signature items - hot plate (waffle topped with Earl grey gelato and seasonal fruits and additional topping of brownie bits with matcha cream) as a pot of Oolong tea. The homemade Earl grey gelato had a strong flavour of Earl grey. The matcha cream is creamy and has strong matcha flavour. It was an interesting experience to have both cold and hot food together. The oolong tea texture is smooth and creamy even there was no cream/milk in it.   Overall, I like this place and hopefully they will expand their drink menu."}
{"text":"Their homemade earl grey ice cream was the best!! Wasn't really expecting much when first got into this place since nobody was inside lol even thought it wasn't open before getting in..REALLY RECOMMEND U GUYS TO TRY THE HOT PLATE OUT!!!"}
{"text":"Pros: -white backgrounds for ig pics -menu is super cute -waffles on a sizzling hot plate (new idea, yummy, worth the $10) -plating is pretty (ex. For the tarts) -waiter was nice  Cons: -not that much seating (~6 tables) -ambiance is pretty casual, nothing too special decor wise -it's not a super cute experience if that's what you're into (that's what I'm into) and the food isnt AMAZING enough to make it memorable otherwise"}
{"text":"This review will be slightly biased as I'm not really a dessert person. But I will balance it out with the service. I think it's a pretty cool concept of serving ice cream and waffles on a hot plate. You get your choice of sauce which you sizzle onto your ice cream and waffles and then sizzles on the hot plate. But after that  I'm not to sure what the purpose of the hot plate was. Service was great though. Friendly and helpful staff."}
{"text":"Okay, I know I do a lot of reviews for dessert places, but that's not ALL I eat - I promise! Many friends have told me how much they enjoy this place so I had to give it a try and it was such a splendid evening!  Management: Most places when you enter, you pull the door, but you need to push to get in for this place. There is a sign that asks you to wait before being seated and they're quick to give you attention because of the bell on the door. Pretty small space and gets full quickly over the weekends.  Cleanliness: Not sure if the off-white is throwing me off, but it looked super clean and the interior decorations are super chic and cute. They feature little jars with dried flowers for center pieces and there's art on display created by local Canadian artists, which are super relatable if you're an East-Asian-Canadian. FYI though - the chairs are kind of heavy!  Service: The staff are really friendly from the moment they greet you at the door to the end of your evening. They are attentive with water and patient in explaining the menu for first-timers.   I enjoyed the following items:  1. Corn Cheese Hot Plate ($8):  This came on a hot plate where the cheese was sizzling! There is also a side of about 6 cubes of toast. You know in cartoons where someone takes a bite of their pizza and then the cheese comes off of it stringy and delicious-looking?? Yup. That's what happened when I put my fork in the corn and put it on my toast! It was so flavourful! I believe it was a bed of corn with mozzarella cheese and some kind of spice. It was perfect for a cold winter evening! However, it was kind of messy to eat, so if you don't like that, I would opt for something else.  2. Kimchi Pork Belly Toast ($12): I absolutely adore kimchi so I really enjoyed this dish. There are 4 pieces of toast; each with a slice of pork belly, kimchi, garlic aioli and scallions. Again, this was a bit messy to eat, but the flavour explosions in your mouth are amazing!  3. Create Your Own Hot Plate ($10 + $2 [extra scoop of ice cream]):  They give you a sheet of paper to customize your Hot Plate however you want. You start with a waffle or brownie base (I chose brownie), then a scoop of ice cream. The ice cream flavours are listed on a blackboard at the front of the house and they're all homemade! They don't make \"regular\" ice cream flavours here - they're all unique! I chose the infamous earl grey and an extra scoop of oolong. Then you get to choose 2 toppings of your choice: fruits, nuts, cookies, brownies, marshmallows, or cinnamon crunch. I got seasonal fruits (pineapple and pear) and cookies (choco chip). Finally, you choose a sauce to pour over your creation for the sizzle. There is vanilla, chocolate and green tea and I chose green tea. The sizzle after I poured the sauce was pretty cool and the actual creation was superb! I don't like earl grey tea but this ice cream is to-die-for! The oolong was pretty awesome too but the earl grey is a MUST. The brownie was a little too sweet but it's a dessert so that's okay!  Overall, this was a fantastic experience and I will definitely come again. Service + desserts + ambience = drooooooooooool! Highly recommended - check it out if you haven't already!"}
{"text":"I keep seeing new dessert places pop up on my facebook and instagram feeds and vowed that i need to go to at least one of them when i come back. Since Sweet Esc was one of the closest locations to me, it became my choice. My brother, having already been there, made a few sugestions that i didn't really take. I ended up getting the giant waffle on a hot plate with earl grey ice cream and a side icecream that had honey and orange flower. They were out of coffee milk tea, which was a disappointment for me. The hot plate really felt extraneous and unnecessary.  So the draw of this place is really the uncommon flavours of ice cream they offer. Here are the reasons why one would come here: 1. You want to try or really like uncommon flavours of ice cream (just get the ice cream) 2. you are nearby and need a place to hang out with friends/on a date - since the place is pretty clean with minimal decor and offers sweets and free wifi  If you are looking for mindblowing dessert, this is probably not the place to go."}
{"text":"They should change their menu on Yelp. They no longer do hot plates. They only serve ice cream now"}
{"text":"To be honest I was never really interested in this place because the whole ice cream and waffle on a hot plate concept just didn't make sense to me, however I was quite intrigued to try it out due to their presentation and the amount of snapchats I've seen. Overall I had a good experience, I thought it was really cool when I drizzled the cream sauce over but taste wise it was okay not memorable or anything. I probably wouldn't go out of my way to come here.   Service and Environment: We came on a Friday night at around 8:30-9pm. Luckily we were able to get a seat right away but soon after they had a lot of customers waiting to get a seat. So be sure to come a bit earlier than 8/9 pm if you don't want to wait long. It was really easy to order - you just had to fill a sheet of what you specifically want on your waffle. Service was also very quick. Unfortunately, I did feel like they were trying to rush us out by giving us our bills when we didn't even ask for it yet.  Desserts: Waffle and Ice-cream Hot Plate: I think the best part of this dish was the ice cream - we tried their Coffee Milk Tea and Earl Grey and the flavours were on point. It's a shame that the ice-cream melts fairly quickly because it's on a hot plate. I got brownies as my toppings and it was pretty good as well, the brownies become soft and chewy after being on the hot plate for a while. The Belgian waffles in my opinion were meh. I thought it was pretty flat and dense rather than airy and fluffy. I got the green tea sauce and it wasn't all that special to be honest, the only great thing about it was that it softened up the dense waffle a bit.   Brownie and Ice-cream Hot Plate: Same as above, the Coffee milk tea ice cream was phenomenal, the brownie was soft and chewy. Overall nothing special."}
{"text":"Got the waffles on the hot plate and it just tastes like regular waffles without the hot plate. So really if you want to try this place, go for the novelty but I wouldn't return for the experience. Came here on a Saturday night before the rush so was no problem getting a table. But after people started showing up, we constantly felt rushed by the inexperienced wait staff, who also by the way didn't bring us any cutlery to go with the hot plated waffles (?!?). I can appreciate that there is a long line, but it just completely ruined the experience as I couldn't even sit and enjoy my food as she was returned on a few occasions to hover over our table. Also if you want to order the drinks, only do so if you enjoy artificially flavoured beverages otherwise save your money."}
{"text":"Ordered the popular waffle on hot stone here. Reasonably priced at $8.50. The coffee ice cream was delicious. It is a unique and fun concept of having waffles on hot plate with ice cream and brownies. The staff was kind to remind us that it's extremely hot (over 200 degrees?), so avoid touching it.   My only complaint would be the waffles are mediocre. It was missing the crispness and texture of a freshly made waffle.   Parking was available as the restaurant is located in a plaza; however, it was hard to find as there's so many other restaurants here that every spot was full. So it just takes some patience to wait. :)   The service here was good. Staff was friendly."}
{"text":"Very tasty homemade ice cream , and the sweetness of the Milo Dino just right, remind me of my childhood"}
{"text":"Go for the tarts! The blueberry tart has made my day. It was my very time to see milo Dino outside Singapore, it was icy but not exactly the same."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place, can't help but drop by every time I am nearby. The decor is wonderful, the food is great, and the service is top notch.   All the Asian cafes uptown feel very Asian but it's clear that there is actual thought put into each aspect of the restaurant from eclectic clocks to cool ceiling hangings, and beautiful wall decorations.   The food is made fresh to order every time and all of their ice cream is made in house. The tarts taste absolutely heavenly and their hot plates are just the bomb.   Also, Mason jars instead of cups? Yes please!"}
{"text":"This is one interesting fusion style dessert and coffee place! They have a sizzling dessert plate!!! Waffles, brownies, ice cream and a sauce that sizzles as you pour it. We had the coconut tart and asked that they toast marshmallows on it and they obliged. It was quite good but the filling was a little boring - some real coconut with texture would have been nice but it was a plan liquid type of filling.  Our friends ordered the sizzling plates one of which contained the vanilla cardamom ice cream which was absolutely delicious.  They aren't much of a coffee place in my opinion but will make you one. I think 13 of us coming in at the same time really overwhelmed the one employee working there but he took care of us."}
{"text":"Ahhh Sweet ESC. Why such high reviews? Small little dessert shop, small selection of desserts, a tad on the expensive side... Don't think I'd come back."}
{"text":"Loved this dessert spot! I can def. say that this place isn't your ordinary dessert place. The service was good, and the staff were really friendly. I felt like the waitress came around often, and made sure we were satisfied with our experience.   I got the hazelnut hot chocolate to drink, wow, it was SO good. If you like Lindt in the hazelnut flavour, you will love this hot drink. My friend & I shared a hot plate (the portion was more than enough to share for both of us), we made our own which consisted of Belgian waffles, brownie bits, marshmallows, vanilla cardamom ice cream + chocolate sauce. It was delicious!!"}
{"text":"Came here for dessert and I didn't realize they redid their whole menu so they now just serve ice cream no waffle and they have coffee.  I like how they have vegan friendly flavours.  The lady who served us was not nice it's like she was bothered that we set foot inside and decided to order."}
{"text":"Came at night a few weeks ago and waited 5-10 mins for a table. Presentation of the desserts was good. Taste was alright.   Taste:  3/5 Service: 4/5 Atmosphere: 3/5 Value for Money: 3/5 Would I come again: Maybe"}
{"text":"Didn't really understand the point of the hot plate. The waffle was pretty hard and so was the brownie."}
{"text":"This rating is based on the items on the menu that I LOVE, which are the ice cream in the Earl Grey, Oolong and Matcha Jasmine flavours.  The ice cream flavours vary in availability daily, but these three are usually available when I visit.  I have been visiting this dessert store for the past two years.  Sweet Esc is known for their hot plate waffles.  They are build-your-own plates with a waffle and your choice of ice cream, sauce and two toppings (e.g. mixed nuts, brownie bits).  You can also have a brownie in place of the waffle.  It's fun to pour the sauce on the sizzling hot plate, but in my opinion, the ice cream alone is good enough.  There are also fruit tarts and cakes that change day-by-day (which I personally don't love).  My favourite cake that I ever tried was the Honey Matcha one, but I haven't seen it in a long time.  I highly recommend the above-mentioned flavours of ice cream.  The Earl Grey is the real stand-out that many of my friends have fallen in love with and continue visiting this location for a taste of it!  You can also bring home a tub of ice cream for $12 or two for $20.  When I visited yesterday, I asked how big the tub was and it is 3-4 scoops.  As each scoop of ice cream is $3.50, it saves you a little bit of money if you would prefer not to eat in.  The servers here are polite, but there is usually only one server in the entire restaurant.  This makes it hard to get their attention.  Nonetheless, I still believe the service was adequate for me to continue returning."}
{"text":"Came here with a group of friends at night. We each chose to build our own plates. The store is pretty tiny, but they have unique ice cream flavours. The place is cute, and I can see it being better for people who come in pairs rather than a large mass of people.   The dessert was just average. Obviously, the charm in the hot plates is the fact they make for cute pictures/videos for social media. Otherwise, I think you're better off going to a difference dessert place as nothing really stood out for me here, and it's pretty pricey for literally just waffles and ice cream."}
{"text":"I love the oolong ice cream & also the double cho cookies. The cookie was freshly baked, and very soft. You must try both!!! I also tried the milo & vanilla cardamom, but I don't like it. Will definitely come back for the cookies"}
{"text":": Sweet Esc : Earl Grey (Top) and Coconut Lime (Bottom) : What else can I say about all the wild flavours they have ? ITS AMAZING : The flavours are very strong and fresh without tasting like there are loads of sugar : The spoon was very buttery/oily half way eating the ice cream, not sure why : $5.50 for two scoops : 9/10"}
{"text":"I came here a year ago and the place was very different from what it is today. Last year they served different desserts. It was nice. But when I went last week, almost a year since my first visit they now only serve ice cream. Apparently it's because the customers really like their ice cream. Anyways, the place is nice. Very clean and friendly staff but it's not the same Sweet Esc as you once knew it as."}
{"text":"Subtracting the Kim chi  roast pork toast since it wasn't my type but it isn't bad if that's your thing.   The service we got from the waitress was above average and she took the time to guide us noobs trough the process. Though the weak among us would also need help to pull the chairs. They weigh a lot.   The thing we ordered was the Belgian Waffle on a hot plate topped with fruits and chocolate milk tea ice cream. With green tea cream sauce on the side that is poured on top of the dish making a nice sizzling sound.   The waffle and ice cream is very light I think you can eat three orders of this without feeling icky.   The coffee milk tea ice cream had a hint of both flavours much better than most coffee tea mixes from the Chinese restaurants.  The price isn't too obscene. At $8.50 for the waffle dish it makes a good finisher for a dinner from elsewhere.  One note though. Seems their wifi does not like iOS devices and won't let me login."}
{"text":"4 stars for the novelty, instagram-worthiness and the ice cream flavors.  WAIT: Came on a Sunday night around 10 pm and there was no one inside! They said we had to order within 10 minutes or so even though they close at 11.  ATMOSPHERE: Pretty typical dessert place, lots of white and tables for groups.  They had \"waiter\" service where you sit down and order and they bring you the desserts.  FOOD: Got the hot stone plate because why not?  HOT PLATE ICE CREAM - you get to choose your base (waffle or brownie), what flavor of ice cream you want, 2 topics and then a drizzle.  I think the total is $10.  The minimum for credit cards is $10 so you meet the minimum.  This is enough for 2 people to share unless you are really hungry where you can finish it by yourself.  The waffle is good, there are 3 quarter pieces and they do get a little soggy but it's not bad for a dessert waffle.  The highlight was the ice cream, we got the jasmine matcha and the jasmine flavor was very prominent and good.  They also had other good flavors like earl grey.  We got the green tea cream drizzle and in hindsight I probably would have gotten chocolate since I like chocolate syrup better.  For toppings we did cookie crumble and brownie.  It's literally a few pieces of cookie and brownie, pretty skimpy.  The \"seasonal fruits\" were just apple and banana.  You can get double of one topping if you want.  When you pour the cream on the hot stone plate it sizzles and kind of disintegrates so it's sort of a waste, but makes for a good video/photo.  Overall, I would recommend people come here for a different type of desert experience.  They also have toast (thick and ones cut in little strips) that I would love to try if I ever come back to Toronto."}
{"text":"I like this place. Its a tiny little space in a small plaza. They make all their ice cream on site and they have some terrific cookies!!  Location: Warden just north of Steeles in a cute plaza with a big spa and some other food venues!  Parking: There's a small above ground lot with a bigger underground lot. So there's parking for all!!!  Venue: Big windows that lets in the sun. Smaller place. Tables with comfy chairs. An ice cream case and cash  The goods: Home made ice cream. Some of it is even vegan?  Neat flavours like lime coconut, cardamom vanilla, earl grey, milo, and guava sorbet. My favourite is honey orange blossom   Fantastic cookies. Chewy with a snap. Yum. You can make an ice cream sandwich with them! Yum  Hot chocolates that are served with a cookie and a chocolate bar!!  Staff: Really nice ad they let you try all the ice creams!! Yum"}
