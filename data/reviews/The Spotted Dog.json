{"text":"This bar is great, for what it is. Super casual, dive bar, with low pricing and really good bar food. They have a pool table, some dart boards, juke box for tunes, plenty of seating and a mixed crowd. I think everything on the menu is under $7 and that is the reason they get five stars. For the same price of an extra value meal, you get a delicious, made to order, greasy plate of delicousness. Their wings are really good, their chicken quesadilla, their soups, their steak dinner, their bacon cheesy fries, it's all good. And the prices for alcohol are low as well. The bartenders are all nice and helpful. You can place take out orders. Their close to home so I'm a big fan."}
{"text":"We love going here! The bar food is just the bees knees! For the price everything rocks! Great employees with very friendly attitudes await your visit! Can't wait to go back! Oh, did I mention the huge portions they give you?! #FoodieFatgurlissues!"}
{"text":"For the past few months I've driven by and wondered about their $5 steaks on Sundays. This last Sunday I went with a few friends and it was actually pretty good. I was expecting a horrible/thin piece of meat, but this was way better. The steak was nice, the fries that came with them were tasty, and the service was pretty good for being more of a bar atmosphere as well. I enjoyed it and for $5 you really can't go wrong."}
{"text":"My fave new neighborhood bar! Great ladies behind the bar, a diverse crowd, and a great bar menu. Try the chicken paprikas soup. It's amazing."}
{"text":"Good potato skins and antipasto salad is HUGE!  Local dive bar so probably not a great solo dining experience for the shy people out there!"}
{"text":"I had the daily special...beer battered chicken dinner. It tasted like something from home. Plus $1.75 domestics. Really? Flippin delicious.  I'll be back!"}
{"text":"This place is a hidden treasure.   The $5.00 steak night on Sunday's is fantastic.   Not the steak you think of when you think of a $5.00 steak.  It's always done to perfection and the fries are seasoned well.    Jenn behind the bar is fantastic and a real pleasure to talk to.  She makes the best Bloody Mary anywhere!!  Treat yourself to the best $5.00 steak in town!!"}
{"text":"Seems like a place where they only take care of their regulars. I literally had to wait 15 to 20 minutes for another beer. Will not be coming back again."}
{"text":"Great food the bartender set us up with paper plates and forks and spoons for our stay in Cleveland,  really friendly people"}
