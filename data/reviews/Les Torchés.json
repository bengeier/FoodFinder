{"text":"Bonne bouffe à très bon prix. Le Tailgate sandwich était gigantesque et la sélection de bière est très intéressante. Il y a de bonne place près des fenêtres (ouverte l'été)et une terrasse."}
{"text":"Really cool bar that we stumbled upon during our trip to Montreal. It's not in the tourist handbook but should be (then again that might ruin it!). Wooden beam walls feel very Canadian in a good way. Just stylish enough to be cool without being stuffy. Hockey games? Perfect spot. Good looked good but we didn't try it. Oh and $5 Moscow mules, Bloody Caesars and Laurentine Ale from 4-8 on weekdays... Need I say more?"}
{"text":"As the name implies, this is a bar people come to to get drunk. On the Saturday we went, the patrons and the staff were energetic, loud and dancing everywhere-which can either be a fun time or an annoying time depending on what kind of night you want. I got a suburban USA college bar bro vibe. The tavern decor is friendly and warm, prices aren't bad and there's an energetic dj on weekends. I came here with a large party (with a reservation). Our service was all over the place-the kitchen staff were super nice and allowed us to serve a cake. However the server for our section was clearly tanked by 11pm and couldn't keep orders straight, tried to double charge many in our party and left for a smoke break without having someone cover us. As a group of 20 we easily spent 500$+ and would have spent and tipped more if we had better table service. That being said, the rest of the staff were nice and I'd consider returning on a less busy night."}
{"text":"Omg the pulled pork grilled cheese is everything!!!! So good!! And the girl bartender was awesome. We came back the next day and she remembered what beers we were drinking from the night before.. best bar food I've ever had."}
{"text":"We came here after the party was already going and we now keep this spot in mind if we're looking for an unpretentious night out. 

We wandered in during a stop between bars and ended up staying longer than expected. Music was great on this Thursday night. Nostalgic pop with some hip-hop and reggae thrown in and your usual top 40 dance hits. 

Security was actually friendly and the only person not having a good time was the poor drunk birthday girl who lost all her friends (happy 18th!).

Can't say much for the food and daytime vibe and we only stuck to reasonably priced beer all night by we had a solid time."}
{"text":"Very cool bar with a fun, laid back vibe.  I had a group here for my birthday. They reserved a large area for us on a Saturday night, without demanding any sort of group minimum spend (which a number of other bars in the area were asking for). Our server was super attentive and really friendly."}
{"text":"Popped in here on a whim because it looked inviting. I was pleasantly surprised by the menu offerings and everyone was happy with their food. Wings and cheese board were especially good. Beers were tasty and I enjoyed a Sommersby's Cider. Music was great, too."}
{"text":"Comme le nom le dit attendez-vous à être torchés...

L'ambiance est semblable à un bar de région. (Ne pas prendre mal...je m'explique...) Dans le sens que tout le monde est friendly et il y a des classiques Québecois et que le monde chante la chanson des Colocs ou Éric Lapointe haut et fort... Vous savez ce genre de bar où la soirée et tranquile et ensuite tout le monde devient amis, ça danse sur les tables, ça crit et tout le monde est content, même celui qui avait un air de beux au début de la soirée? Ben c'est ça...MOI J'AIME! 

La serveuse très très trop joyeuse et sympa... Ça nous donne le sourire et envie de faire le party avec elle aussi...Plusieurs choix de bière yeah Alors voilà, j'ai aimé!"}
{"text":"They have a good variety of beers and interesting take on pub grub. The prices are reasonable and the atmosphere is very friendly and casual. The staff is great and can make you feel like a regular your first time there!"}
{"text":"This was a really bad experience. At least the food was inexpensive. I had the \"the tailgater\" hotdog, which turned out to be a shrivelled grocery store hotdog slathered in overly sweet pulled pork on an open faced, burnt grocery store hot dog bun (described as \"homemade\"). My partner got the tacos, and they were damp, soggy hard shell grocery store taco shells stuffed with weirdly overly sweet ground meat that was cloyingly overseasoned with thyme. It was bad food, and the service didn't help. A table of very sweet elderly ladies sitting near us received almost no attention from the server despite multiple attempts at contact and the staff repeatedly tried to upsell our order. Poor across the board."}
{"text":"Les Torchés est quand même un bar nice du Plateau. Sur l'avenue Mont-Royal, c'est un lieu très ordinaire qui propose des bières classiques selon vos goûts, des cocktails et alcools forts, ainsi que de quoi manger lorsque vous avez faim (nachos, burgers, etc.).

Mais le fait que cela soit un bar ordinaire a tout de même son charme. Premièrement, la musique qui passe est assez old school, avec les célèbres titres des années 80-90 voire plus, passant du rap au rock en passant par du funk. Le dimanche, vous avez un 2 pour 1 sur certaines bières, ce qui est pas mal pas mal. Enfin, en plus d'un service très correct, il y a une terrasse pour boire son breuvage à l'air frais et profiter du soleil.

En bref, Les Torchés reste très classique, mais je vous le conseille si vous voulez faire un prédrink (ou plus !) avec vos amis."}
{"text":"On a retrouvé \"notre\" bar !!!!!

Oui, après que celui où nous allions tout le temps soit passé végétarien, nous étions un peu désemparé. Mais ça y est !!! On l'a retrouvé !

Le bar avec une super ambiance !
Le bar où passe les matchs du Canadiens (mais tout le monde n'est pas non plus à fond, ça va, on peut quand meme discuter sans se faire reprendre ^^) !
Le bar avec DJ (pour les mi-temps et fin de match) ! D'ailleurs on retient que quand le CH prend un but, on a droit à l'enregistrement de \"tabarnak ! calice de tabarnak !\", et ça, c'est quand même très drôle !! :D
Le bar où il y a plateau de fromages et charcuteries, prix abordables et mmmmiam !!!
Le bar proche de la maison !

Bref, le bar où on a déjà envie de revenir !!! :)"}
{"text":"Bartender/waitress was awesome this morning. Exactly the humor we needed and great service, super bubbly and told us all about the local happenings."}
{"text":"This place was amazing!!!! The staff was very friendly and it was nice place to chill and have fun!!! The bartenders always make sure you are good and everyone is having a great time! The wings are super hot, but very good!!!!! If you are ever in Montreal stop at this bar!!!"}
{"text":"Les torchés is a small cosy bar we ended up visiting because it was confirmed they will show the Habs game. Indeed the game was on on multiple screens and we got a complimentary bottle of beer as token for good luck. I wish that nice touch from the owners worked in Habs favor, but hélas! 

Back to our time in the pub, it was fun. People kept coming and our table for eight accommodated 13 somehow. So if you want to come with big crowd for drinks the size of Les torchés is not an issue. The noise level will allow for limited communication, but this is to be expected, The list of drinks is not an issue either, lots to choose from. The Bloody Caesar was uneventful. That was well compensated by my bacon bamboo sticks: candied bacon in spicy sauce, so hot that it will help you consume a pint of beer, bot soooo good. The small plates menu is really nice, my friends were happy with the tacos and chicken wings. Considering the amount of bars in the area I'm not sure when I will go back to this bar, but it is on my list for places to have a drink when I'm thirsty...!"}
{"text":"Wonderful, friendly staff, amazing mules. Nice, cozy bar that was an excellent place to stop and unwind."}
{"text":"Actually worth five stars. 

Cest increible. Was hunting from Peel st a decent spot for a brat and a beer (le sausige) and finally stumbled to a burly, gritty bartender who put on fkn dope music and served me le pies de resistance - a fuckng hotdog with pulled pork. 

The ambiance is honest to god a real bar. I swear, its an actual bar. Really fun. Cute chicks."}
{"text":"Tavern looking bar, with a super fun atmosphere. 
The music is awesome, with tons of hits from the 90's. Mix of all types of music. Laid back place where you can really go hangout with friends without having to dress up, and have a great time. 
The staff is Ok, definitely not friendly."}
{"text":"If you're in the Plateau and looking for somewhere to grab a drink come to Les Torches.  It has a casual, laid back atmosphere and they have great happy hour specials.  Usually happy hour here runs from 4 to 8 and they have a handful of cocktails that are $5.  There is also wine and a special beer for $5 and $6.  If you're not enticed by those there are a variety of beers and other drinks to choose from.  

There is a small food menu.  I didn't try it but it is something I'll want to try on future visits.  I would also imagine that this would be a good bar to watch Habs games.  They had several giant TVs in the bar that would be ideal for watching hockey."}
{"text":"La terrasse est agréable mais, malheureusement, la musique est bien trop forte. Si vous êtes à la recherche d'un bar un peu plus tranquille mais toujours trendy, préférez le Plan B (à quelques pas du métro Mont-Royal)."}
{"text":"Super bar sur le plateau ! L'ambiance est vraiment chouette et on y passe de la bonne musique. Les serveurs sont également très sympathiques. Et les verres sont grands, bref, c'est l'endroit idéal pour une bonne soirée (un peu) arrosée"}
{"text":"Mercredi soir 23h,19 août, rempli de gens sur le party autant à l'intérieur que sur la terrasse pour célébrer leur 1er anniversaire. Petit bar de quartier, ambiance festive et sympa. Clientèle mix de 20 ans à 35/40 ans. Plusieurs choix de bières et cocktails. L'endroit parfait pour faire la fête entre amis ou inconnus ! 

4/5 visité en août 2015"}
{"text":"We were attracted to this place because the music sounded cool, the atmosphere seemed relaxed, and the menu listed unhealty barfood. We ordered beer (pint $7, small glass $4.75) and a platter of nachos ($16) to share. Those nachos, although topped with cheese, coriander, olives, and guac, were a little on the dry side. Even the sour cream and salsa couldn't save it. Longing for something more juicy, we followed it up with mac&cheese ($15). They were topped with a honey dressed salad that went nicely with the truffled cheesy macaroni.
Our waiter wasn't the friendliest and could have spared a smile or two.
The atmosphere was also not as fun as we had hoped it would be so I probably won't become a regular here."}
{"text":"Favorite bar in Montreal by far. Awesome drinks for great prices and super friendly bartenders. Cute and comfortable."}
{"text":"Awesome place for cocktails. Food is great and staff is friendly. Prices are decent. I have become what you would call a regular here for my after work drinks. People here are always fun and friendly and this includes the customers who seem to always be open to meet people and have some shots with you."}
{"text":"Very mellow bar, laid back attitude, great tunes, good beer selection, and a very interesting menu. If you're in the area check it out :)"}
