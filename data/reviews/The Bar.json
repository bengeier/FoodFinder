{"text":"Very cool spot! Plays Motown and have good strong music with good people!!! 4 large tv screens so you can really get into the sports!"}
{"text":"Finally a true neighborhood bar where you get to know the bartenders and they get to know you! Perfect, laid-back, mid-West vibe with great Eats and Drinks. If you've never had a Cubano Sandwich... The Bar nails it!"}
{"text":"I have lived 4 blocks from the Concourse for 6 years. When I heard they remodeled, me and a friend decided to check out The Bar for happy hour. WOW! The space is lovely...intimate, low key, soft music, variety of seating. I've gotten so tired of the packed, loud, average service, and pretentious food of lot of restaurants downtown. Walking into this place was like discovering an oasis from all that. Absolutely cannot say enough about the two servers. Attentive, knowledgeable, and were willing to get our questions answered if they didn't know. They pay attention to the little things here, which in any dining experience is so important. I have a huge pet peeve with bars writing their beer menu on a board with no menu for customers who are not seated at the bar. It's lazy and thoughtless. So when I realized there was no menu and asked what was on tap, the server did a little thing that I was so impressed with...instead of rattling off a bunch beer names, half of which I wouldn't know about, she said what type they were so it made my decision quick and easy. Beer selection is well represented but not extensive. But does anyone really need every bar to offer 100 beers? No.  Now, to the food. Again, WOW! Great menu and great prices. We had the artichoke dip and it was fantastic! Creamy, hot, and cheesy with big chunks of artichokes. Served with toasted pita bread, which was a nice touch because it made dipping and eating worry free that I was going to drip globs on the way to my mouth. At $10 it seemed a little pricey but the serving was huge and more then plenty to share with 2-3 people. We also had the chicken chili for $6. When they brought out the bowls we were shocked! It was a meal. Both of us were stuffed and I even took some of the soup home. The chili was hearty with good size chunks of chicken and plenty of beans. It had a little heat but nothing to deter sensitive palates. My friend, who is very picky about food quality, loved it all. We were so impressed with the whole experience we asked for the manager to tell him how great the service, food, and ambience was and that we will be coming back for many more visits. I've been telling all my friends. Way to go, Concourse!"}
{"text":"Joe at Neatly's is standout. Sandwich consultation at its finest and a truly excellent delivery.  Great late night date spot or a few HH beers with the guys"}
{"text":"I was super excited that new peeps were attempting to fill the long empty Superfun boots of Ky's place, right in my hood. And I was doubly excited that the joint was boasting beat sliders in the galaxy. But... The superfun is gone. Stunningly bright bar with fairly pricey drinks. A bunch of nods to my hometown Detroit charmed me a bit, as did the quaint couch. But upon moving the armchair an inch in order for it to face our large group on the couch, we found the charm was fake. Some Lady stomped over while we were ordering another round to angrily smash the chair back into its original angle. No fucking thanks on that. And what i thought was going to perhaps be my daily meal henceforth, the sliders... Were ok hamburgers. Not sliders smothered with unasked for cheese. Overall: polite owner, nice detroit swag, but just an ok place to grab one drink, but not the kind of place you'd consider fun. Or worth hanging out at."}
{"text":"Cool place, but you get charged to put drinks on ice.. not cool. Up charged $6, with no warning, again not cool.   Update:I am updating from 2 stars to 3. I am giving 1 additional star for the quick response from owner. Thanks Mike, I appreciate the explanation, and quick response."}
{"text":"This was a good recommendation from Yelp. I went to this bar it was pleasantly surprised to find out that it had food good food at that. I tried the wings and I was not disappointed. The neat thing was this place is super trendy but it also has very casual Vibe. I would go so far as to maybe call it a half casual half trendy half dive which really isn't a half but you get what I'm going with it. The drinks were well priced and the wait staff was super friendly. They were really on top of the ball tonight. The TVs were an added plus as well"}
{"text":"I was looking for a place for my son to go hang out. This is a Very nice neighborhood bar. Good drink specials, friendly and efficient bartender (she was the only bartender and that girl was ON HER JOB). The customers were cool and open to light conversation. It was just what I was looking for. The Bar is my new spot"}
{"text":"A unique Arcadia bar that provides wonderful service ; if you like reasonably priced drinks and food this is the place to go."}
{"text":"Great ambiance, food, and drinks. A perfect spot for happy hour. You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Just a great local bar.   The bartender was friendly and knew what he was doing and the drinks were reasonably priced.   But the thing that really takes it over the top is nellys food.   We had the wings which were great. Not too hot but does have a late heat that can sneak up on you.   Also had the slides which were amazing. If you like the burger at The Stand then you will love the sliders!  They are a must order.   Space is somewhat hidden now with the strip mall remodeling but once the signage is up this place will be packed."}
{"text":"Great out-of-the-way bar. Happy hour from 4-6 with $3 beer specials. Order a specialty drink or wine and you can get an appetizer for $6. It's a one-for $6 deal but if you're with a group, you can each get a drink/wine and order something to share. The artichoke dip is good and has a bit of a bite, although my palette is very susceptible to heat. So most people will probably not even notice. The cheese plate is awesome! A 10 year cheddar, a Bleu, and a gouda(?), with small crostini and a small ramekin of sweeter, spicy mustard. (that I didn't try but I'm taking the word of one brave member of our party) The meatballs were very good, not too much spice. Tasty, and not over-cooked, with excellent crusted bread slices to help clean up the sauce. The wine list is not extensive (at least by the glass), and a bit unassuming, but there's at least something for everyone. I had a decent Cabernet Sauvignon but probably would have enjoyed the Male more. Not very far from Overture Center, we were here on a week-night when Wicked was playing and the bar was not crowded at all. Just the way you expect a quintessential hotel bar to be. I know where I'm going before my next Overture event."}
{"text":"Pseudo dive bar with a touch of retro - small, no windows, cozy - but no stale beer smell. Tasty cocktails, a great wine and beer selection, friendly service, awesome playlist and eclectic patrons. The 'bar nuts' (homemade donuts) are to die for. If you think donuts aren't bar food, think again. They were still warm and I can't stop thinking about them."}
{"text":"Food is very good, service is not. If you sit in one of the three booths here, be prepared to wait, and wait, and wait and wait.  We're actually sitting here now and the terrible service compelled me to take the time to write this review.  This went from a 5 star visit to a 1 star in the FIFTY TWO (YES, 52) minutes we've been sitting here waiting for refills/check.  It's not like he forgot about us, he's just a terrible server and bartender. He was standing at the booth RIGHT NEXT to us and didn't think to turn around and ask how we were doing? No refills, never checked on us and the food, nothing.  And what makes it worse? His buddy working with him had to ask us if we needed anything else. So, I guess it's ok to let people finish your crap work?  Next time, we're going to slip out the door without paying. It's not like he would have noticed.  Won't be back. That's for damn sure."}
{"text":"Great neighborhood spot to enjoy good food and drinks with friends.  Small yet intimate.  Looking forward to the dog friendly patio that's coming this apring."}
{"text":"Trying out this new spot.  Small and cozy. Cool atmosphere.  Matt is a cool n friendly bartender.  Excited for food from the Neatly a bit later - same owner as the Stand.  Michigan themed in a subtle but fun way.  Updated- Neatly sliders and grilled cheese were fantabulous!!!"}
{"text":"What a hidden gem! I'd heard about this place from some friends and was in the area so decided to stop by. Took me a sec to find the place since the plaza is under construction. The bartender acknowledged me as I walked it. Pretty attentive I'd say, considering the Super Bowl was on and the place was full. When I finally got a seat, the bartender comes by and starts telling me about the place. What I thought was cool was that she also turned out to be the GM. I've always fancied leadership willing to get their hands dirty, as the saying goes. She took orders, mingled, made drinks, bussed table. Good to see. Eventually I ordered food. Kind of strange, but at the same time a cool novelty - she says she doesn't take orders; you walk up to the window and tell the kitchen what you want. I immediately recognized the chef from a burger shop up the street called The Stand I used to frequent when I lived in Arcadia! Not sure what his role is with this place, but it's for the best! The guy puts his elbow in it, as grandma used to say. Anywho, I ordered the flat iron sliders (as recommended) and the pork quesadilla. Both were phenomenal! Got some grease on my pant leg and wasn't even upset about! DEFINITELY try the sliders.   As far as the atmosphere, it's a smaller place. You can see everything going on in the room, which I like because I'm a people watcher. It's not the right size for a sports bar, but tvs are accessible from anywhere in the room, and seeing the amount of ppl there for the game, I'd say it's pretty popular with the locals. I'd like to come back sometime and see the place with music and a nighttime feel. But rest assured, I'll be back for the food."}
{"text":"I have to start out by saying that I am SO excited to have this awesome new dive{ish} bar in the Arcadia/Phoenix community! We were definitely in need of another great, casual spot to go! It is SO cozy, a fun place to watch sports, meet friends late afternoon or night, indulge in DELICIOUS eats by The Stand's newest concept, and the reality is, The Bar is just an all around win!   I enjoyed an order of their sliders which are absolutely incredible. Guys, i'm talking melt-in-your-mouth status! I can't even drive by without my mouth beginning to salivate at the thought of their deliciousness. But I mean, they're made by The Stand so duh, of course they're going to knock it out of the park! The fries are also phenomenal - I didn't want them to stop! I had a refreshing glass of chardonnay with my sliders and definitely left a happy camper. I loved the overall energy and feel of the bar.   Lucky me, The Bar is biking distance from my house so you better believe that we'll be regulars at this new neighborhood spot! Definitely pay them a visit, you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Stopped in to get something to eat but they only serve food till 9 PM on weekdays and 10pm on weekends. Like the vibe of the place but I got to get something to eat so I got to go.  They closed for a while but I understand they're open again."}
{"text":"Love this place! Great vibe, great drinks, great music and great food. I love this addition to our 'hood"}
{"text":"This is a trendy little bar inside of the Concourse Hotel. I loved the ambiance and would definitely go back! Their prices are reasonable, I honestly expected it to cost much more than it did. We tried a speciality coconut chocolate martini that was delicious, a Bloody Mary that was on the spicy side, and cheese curds. Everything was great!"}
{"text":"Love this place. I regularly frequent and my go-to spot. Garrett has been so hospitable and I will continue to return while he's here. Thanks for the exceptional service and food I will be sure to recommend"}
{"text":"Cool neighborhood bar with a Big Lebowski theme.  The bartender was super friendly, nice drink selection and food after 2pm on Saturdays.  I opted for an Ace Pear Cider and enjoyed it as always.  Definitely a chill bar that could be come a locals haunt."}
{"text":"A strange place. The storefront of the bar is not completed, and there's no real notice of what you are walking into when you first pull up to the address. It's actually quite small. There are only four or five booths and a couple of tables, and the rest is bar stool seating -- perhaps 10 or 12 of those. There's a tiny stall in the back they they sell food out of . . . Didn't try the food. This review is about the ambiance and the \"we're all friends here, so who are you?\" atmosphere of the joint.  We walked in and everyone in the place turned and looked at us. After a few smiles didn't seem to change much, we grabbed a couple of seats and then decided to go ahead and leave. It was one of the most unfriendly places we've walked into in recent memory . . . Of course, everyone in the bar was young and a hipster, and we don't fit that mold. So I'd say that there's some serious age discrimination that goes in here ):  Didn't like it. You might, but we sure didn't."}
{"text":"It WAS a great bar but unfortunately it's been closed since November for \"mechanical issues\". We hope it opens back up."}
{"text":"Is the \"Bar\" permentatly closed?  I go by often to see the same sign on the door...I highy doubt that malfunctions are the reason?"}
{"text":"Nice little bar with a good selection of beer and liquors and great service. Neatly's is good, a small menu, but good nonetheless. Will definitely return!"}
{"text":"Incredible little bar that exceeds all hotel bar expectations. Very reasonably priced for a hotel - $2 PBRs!  Can't complain about the drinks - highly recommend the Sconnie Old Fashioned!  The drinks are great but the food stole the show. Everything we got was amazing, especially the spinach and artichoke dip. I don't say this lightly, but it is the best spinach and artichoke dip I have ever had!  The staff was nice and attentive. Highly recommend making a visit, even if you aren't staying in the hotel!"}
{"text":"Place has great ambiance, really good bar for Michigan fans. Nice local bar. I thought for basically being a bar it had poor draft beers (6 taps) and one of them was coffee beer/Guinness which is nicknamed \"Starbucks\" when mixed together. A lot of potential. I'd definitely come back, they should take advantage of the local beers like four peaks or San tan."}
{"text":"As described by others this is a small dive bar, apparently with good food, but we weren't eating. Yelp should not have \"sports bar\" in the description however. That, it is not. They have 4 TVs, but two of them had the movie Wedding Crashers showing. It is too dark and the music was a bit loud for my tastes, but it is pretty nice for  a \"dive bar\"."}
{"text":"Excellent atmosphere, food, and of course adult beverages. Prices are reasonable. Staff is also super friendly. They make a mean bloody mary. Be sure to try to Italiano sandwich and the boneless wings...delish! This place can fill up fast...might want to stop by during off-peak days/hours."}
{"text":"Bright,  clean, friendly atmosphere,  the owner introduced himself shortly after stopping in for a cocktail with family from out of town. They offered a great drink selection and a fun bar food menu that I'll definitely go back to try."}
{"text":"Great location!! Love this place. Service was outstanding. Food, drinks and music made for a perfect happy hour and beyond."}
{"text":"Omg, this place is amazing!  Great drinks and the sliders, heaven on a sour dough bun!  Fresh ground beef.  Food is separate by Neatly's which is the same folks as THE STAND. Please come, great retro vibe, music, everything. My new fav!"}
{"text":"A house guest was watching a chef on the local TV station cooking.  During the presentation the chef's nose was runny and he wiped his nose with his hand the wiped that hand with the other hand.  TV station continued to film.  Not a place We will be going to anytime soon."}
{"text":"Located inside the Madison Concourse Hotel, this is a great intimate bar with not only good drinks but also some bar bites.  I've been here a few times with some new friends I've made during my visit here in Madison.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Love this spot.  Nice and chill.  Neatly's is tasty.  Bar staff is always friendly.  Don't expect a fancy hand craft cocktail though.  This is your un pretentious neighborhood spot you can always count on."}
{"text":"Pretty small bar but has a good beer selection and good vibe and music. Bartender are super nice and attentive. Definitely will be back for live music nights."}
{"text":"This is a nice little place tucked into a non-descript strip mall on the Northwest corner of 32nd St and Indian School Rd.  They are actually refurbishing the outside of the buildings in this center which makes The Bar even harder to find, which is a plus in my book.  Once inside, there's a long bar to the left and a few booths to the right.  Also a handful of TVs if you want to watch a game.  They have beer, wine, cocktails and food that you order at the far end of the bar.  We had a couple of beers and a couple of appetizers.  The sliders in particular were really good.  Service was friendly and the whole vibe was very comfortable."}
{"text":"It was cool, fun, had good food, and good drinks. But it was expensive. Made me sad that the well whiskey was $7. I would frequent this place if drinks were more affordable. Oh well. Guess I'll keep looking for an affordable cocktail bar."}
{"text":"My wife and I went to The Bar tonight with my brother who has already become a regular in its first three weeks. Don't be deterred by the non-descript outside door (I think that's the point). Upon entry, we were immediately greeted by the owner Mike and welcomed into his bar. It was a pretty good crowd for a Thursday night and the place was running really well with a bartender, a cook, and the owner mingling among the crowd.   The restaurant is run separately from the bar (different tabs), but you order at the window of the restaurant (called Neatly's and run by the owners of The Stand) and they bring it right to you at your bar seat. We had the sliders, cuban, grilled cheese, and wings - all pretty good and quick and easy to eat. I liked the sliders the best.   It has the cool dive bar feel based on location and size. It reminds me a bit of a newer Jt's Bar & Grill, which is one of our favorite bars in Arcadia. I think The Bar will do well and we will definitely be back. The only thing I'd like to see in the future would be a few more craft beers on tap. They did have Bell's Two Hearted and Huss Scottsdale Blonde, but half of their beers on tap were along the lines of Coors Light, Modelo Especial, etc."}
{"text":"The \"anti dive bar\" Really cool place, nice lighting. Reasonable prices. Definitely will return."}
{"text":"Was here tonight and it was the greatest little place. Not only was the place perfect for Happy hour but the food from Neatlys was great!!! Will absolutely be back many times!!!! Loved it."}
{"text":"It's a hip, small spot with a dive bar vibe. Big Lebowski memorabilia decorate the bar, and a huge Hunter S. Thompson quote hangs on the wall visible upon entry. It's cheeky, fun, and the perfect local spot. The bartender Abby is super friendly. Shortleash Hot Dogs have a walk up window inside right next to the bar, and the food is beyond great. Will definitely be making this a regular in my rotation!"}
{"text":"Super chill vibe - we love going here on Sundays. Everyone that works here is super friendly and the food is bomb!"}
{"text":"Comfy cozy and quiet. Neighborhood bar with a chill The Big Lebowski themed atmosphere. New and clean in appearance. A few tv's and a few board games available. They do serve HOT DOGS!!! Didn't get a chance to try them, but I shall return to try them! I would totally come here again, must try the hot dogs!"}
{"text":"Happy Hour: Monday - Friday 3-6pm HH Specials: $2 off wine, drafts, and apps,   In a strip mall, there sits a small little bar. After talking to the owners, we learned that they just changed management a little over a month ago. The drinks are all twists they have on classics such as White Russians, Mojitos, and etc. It's a fairly simple and small bar that is probably best for folks who just want a chill and intimate vibe.  I didn't have the time to try it but they had cheese curds which I rarely find anywhere outside of the midwest. If I'm ever in the area again, I'm definitely giving that a go! Their social media shows that they do a lot of game showings so there's that for those who are into it.  All in all, this is a nice, small little place for a more casual bar vibes."}
{"text":"Love this spot. Great atmosphere. Wonderful service. Terrific food. Decent prices. The owner is in his element!"}
{"text":"Ok!  Because everyone makes mistakes, I had to say the problems at THEE BAR are fixed and the place is awesome!  We all have or have had employees that do not deliver the level of service expected and they rectified It quickly! Great drinks Great food Great service Great vibe Glad they are in the hood!!"}
{"text":"Ugh. Wait. I love it here. Why haven't I been here before?! I came at the perfect time because short leash hotdogs is now here!!   The bar is so secretive feeling and I love it. The inside is decorated so cute and the bartenders were super nice and attentive.   They also put the football game I wanted to watch on without hussing and fussing!  I highly recommend the sunny or Cubano hodog!!!"}
{"text":"This place is great.  The service was very attentive, drinks good and strong, and the food is excellent.  I would recommend the wings!  The decor is interesting.  This is a place you can spend a relaxing evening with friends."}
{"text":"I love The Stand so I was excited to try a new place made by the same owners. My mom and I were the firsts to arrive and it still hadn't opened despite it being passed the opening time. My mom and I planned on eating lunch here and waited nearly two hours for the kitchen to open. The bartender told us numerous times the man was running late but it would only be ten minutes more.... two hours later after having several drinks each, as we were leaving the guy finally decided to show up. We ordered some food and it was decent but they veggie tray is definitely over priced. Will give it one more chance to redeem itself."}
{"text":"This place is great. Sliders. Fried pickles. Deviled eggs. Really really good for a hotel bar."}
{"text":"Ah, The Bar. I really liked you when I first discovered you when invited to a meeting here and was excited to come back. You have so much potential. You need to have more than one person working the entire room, though.  The bartender/server was great from the little we interacted with her, but her visits were few and far between because she was running through the bar all night. Literally. Occasionally someone else would run food out for her, but she was waiting on 40 or so people by herself. Bonkers.   I ordered a hot toddy - dark rum, vanilla, honey, and mulled spices. My table mates were served long before me - in all it took over 30 minutes to get my drink. At one point the bartender did check back in with me to let me know they might be out of one of the ingredients, but it eventually appeared. It was delicious, so I'm glad for that, but 30-40 minutes to get a pretty simple drink is outrageous.   It took about 45 minutes to an hour after arriving for us to be able to put in a food order. We ordered from the woman who was occasionally popping in to order food. She was nice, but didn't know the menu. We were curious what the white sauce was on the chicken wings, and she had no clue, but at least offered to go back to the kitchen to ask (if you're curious - mayo and miso). We ended up passing on that and getting the mini meatballs with romanesco sauce, artichoke and spinach dip, and the assorted Wisconsin cheeses with pickled vegetables and mustards.   After we finally put in our order, the food came out in a reasonable amount of time after. The food runner gave us our cheese plate with no explanation of what anything was - I was able to catch the bartender and she was able to tell us what cheeses were on the plate - a blue cheese whose name I forget, a butter kaese, and a five-year cheddar. The pickled vegetables were just one variety - I believe it may have been zucchini? They had a strong, spicy kick that was delicious. The mentioned mustards ended up also being singular - all I can say is there was some sort of sweet element to it. Not my thing.   The meatballs were indeed mini, but tasty. The bread served with it was really delicious. I don't know if the five tiny meatballs were worth $9, though - the quality didn't equal out to two dollars a bite.   The artichoke and spinach dip came out bubbling hot, and was good - it tasted like it may have had a beer base, but there's no mention of that on the menu. The chunks of artichoke were hearty and there was a good amount of spinach. It was nice because it didn't have an overly cheesy/greasy/heavy feel that many such dips do.   I love the colors of The Bar, and the booth-like chairs were really comfy. We had a TV in our area that was set to a good volume on a music channel until the World Series came on.   I'll be back to give it another go, possibly before a show at Overture, but I have all my fingers crossed that service will improve. At the rate we went tonight, there's no way we would have made showtime despite arriving at 5:30 if that was our goal."}
{"text":"What a fantastic bar !  The atmosphere is terrific.  The size of the bar is just right.  I really enjoyed watching the local football games here and had a great time with the ASU fans !  This is the best bar in Arcadia to watch ASU !  I used to frequent JT's but this bar is much better.  Even the wings are better !"}
{"text":"The Bar is that casual neighborhood bar that this area needed!  Super chill vibes, inexpensive drinks, and awesome bar food (courtesy of Nealty's which is owned by the people who run the Stand - try the wings!!).  There are tv's playing the latest sports game, and you are surrounded by Lebowski decor.    All in all, this place is a win in my books and I'll be chilling here again soon!"}
{"text":"Went for happy hour Friday. Great food. Amazing prices! $5 mules all day everyday. Sliders and chicken wings were great. I see people complaining about the signage, I think that's wash makes the bar great is its subtleness. The white flag sign really takes away from that. Regardless, great bar. Would recommend 10/10!!"}
{"text":"I've been here when they first opened and fell in love with The Stand sliders. I was sad when the stand left and were replaced with hotdogs. Today,I tried again, intrigued by the change in ownership and new menu.   Pros-looooove the cheese curds despite paying $9 (I wish the menu specified if they come with ranch or marinara and wish I was told that extra ranch was 50 cents which I ordered not realizing it came with ranch).   We loved the bartender; she was awesome!  Cons-I hate how it says $2 off food on \"select items\" for happy hour but doesn't say which items.   We ordered curds (yum), wings (just ok-$2 off for hh), $12 cheese burger (yum but fries were thick and uncrispy), and potato skins ($9 for 4 tiny so-so potato skins which is a huge rip off).   I probably won't make this a regular happy hour spot but still hope they make it!  I miss the Moscow mule which was always $5 (now no specialty cocktails are on hh and the MM was $7)."}
{"text":"Awesome neighborhood bar. It's a bit hard to find--no big sign, just a door into the bar itself. I've gone with friends and family, and it's a fun vibe for everyone. Big picture of \"The Dude\" behind the bar for any movie lovers.   We planned a last-minute surprise party for my dad there the day before the event, and the owner worked with us to make sure we had all the appetizers, food, and drinks we needed--it turned out great! I've been a regular ever since. A hidden gem in the Arcadia area."}
{"text":"Love this neighborhood bar! Major shout out to Bartenders Abbey and Ari! They took great care of us and made delicious drinks! HIGHLY RECOMMEND!"}
{"text":"Awesome spot. Great ambiance and amazing food from Neatly's. Cocktails and beers are delicious and the pricing is reasonable. Great spot for happy hour. Perfect little neighborhood bar filled with all kinds of friendly faces, from staff and patrons alike."}
{"text":"Visited last night.  We moved into the city in April last year. The Bar is walking distance from our house and epitomizes why we moved. - great food - great drink - friendly staff We will be regulars."}
{"text":"Stopped in, with my boss (from the Atlanta, GA area), in Madison, Looking for a spot that would be entertaining and near our Hotel in or near the Capital.  Couldn't agree that 'The Bar' was the spot...cool, no nonsense name.  We ordered various Beers and Cheese Curds (when in Wisconsin), Burgers with Fries and some chicken wings on the side.  (We were hungry).  A nice place to kick back have a conversation and people watch.  looking forward to stopping by again, when in the Madison area.  Cheers!"}
{"text":"This place is the perfect dive bar experience. Clean, friendly staff, great drinks. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Love this place. Found it about 3 months ago and I've popped in with friends and family at least 5 or 6 times. The wings are amazing, the potato skins delicious and drink specials are always on so that's a win in my book. Playlist is always different  and I usually love it. It's never packed but always active or a good crowd. It's just chill  A perfect neighborhood bar. I wish it was even closer."}
{"text":"Great cocktails,ice cold drafts! Blanton's...thank you! Service was fab, entertaining...great music. Have to go back and try some eats but overall five stars all the way..dive bar wink wink"}
{"text":"Nice clean new neighborhood spot that has a badass female bartender making the best drinks.  Very clean.  Fun for watching football.  Short leash just went in to serve food a few days ago.  I love short leash, but I will miss those amazing ironed sliders.  They were absolutely amazing!!!"}
{"text":"The place is closed temporary? It has been like that for a week. I tried to call before heading over but phone has no recording. Lots of other bars to drink at."}
{"text":"When we went, they had just opened recently under new management. You could tell they were still trying to figure out the kinks as well manage their inventory and whatnot. This place is in a plaza with a huge parking lot so you shouldn't have trouble finding parking.  We came here during their happy hour (Monday through Friday, 3-6pm). I ordered the dudebro ($10) which is essentially a White Russian. When talking to the bartender, she mentioned that a lot of their drinks are their twists on normal drinks.  I enjoyed our time there even if we only stayed for about an hour."}
{"text":"The service in the bar both times was attentive with drinks and water being refreshed on a regular basis. Whether or not they are busy just depends on the day and the hour but both times I've been there in recent history it wasn't crowded and the groups I was with could talk and easily hear one another. The menu is small but it was just right for sharing with others at the table. Some soups, salads, \"snacks\", and sandwiches as well as cheese and meat spread options. I had a delish carrot soup and shared the beet salad and chicken flat bread. It was just right and all very good. I'm on he fence about whether the higher prices are worth it but after a holiday martini I would say that 'yes' it was worth it!"}
{"text":"Great little bar offering excellent drinks. The place seems like The Big Lebowski however the day I went they didn't have any white Russians or as they call them Caucasians to sell. The bartender was friendly the atmosphere is great it's a great little place and I hope to be able to review it and give it 5 Stars after having one of their white Russians"}
{"text":"Great place to grab a drink and chill. Big screen TV's, full bar, lots of trivia question games and great people. Came in to grab some sliders from neatlys which were delicious and a few beers. Service was great!"}
{"text":"They had alcohol and I ended up with two drinks which is why they get three stars. That and the food was actually decent. Vodka soda and the soda was as flat as nebraska. The bar. Very generic while pretending and wanting to be hip. I felt really old liking the decor, yet was upset that it was here. Drinks were overpriced, the crowd was not friendly or welcoming. What sealed the deal was when I overheard a guy in his 20's with a Cincinnati Reds jersey on say 'here is why my friend and I voted for trump'. I have no reason to ever go back especially when their is way too many great bars in the area."}
{"text":"Loved this place!! Fantastic cheese curds and fries. The atmosphere is great because it is small, dark, and has fun lights!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome! Great drinks, friendly staff and an interior decorated with a ton of Big Lebowski items (including a sign that says, \"The rug really ties the room together\"). The best part, however, is probably the small food window located in the back - Neatly's. Menu was developed by the owners of The Stand, so you can expect some seriously delicious food. Unfortunately I don't live nearby, but will always consider stopping in when I am!"}
{"text":"The Bar mixes a hell of a caucasian, Jackie. I love the cute Lebowski themed bar. It's small and intimate. The drinks are stiff and decently priced. The food is insane good.... those little sliders served on the cutest round pieces of toast are perfection. They put In N Out burger to shame. They may be my favorite burgers in town (just simple high quality deliciousness). Check out The Bar..... You won't be sorry!   But you know, that's just, like, my opinion, man."}
{"text":"This place is small but pretty awesome. It's a nice little spot to grab a quick drink and be on your way... or grab a couple drinks and hang out"}
{"text":"Kinda didn't get it?! Strange name & atmosphere (horrible center under construction). Beer selection ok & food 'partnership' unique. Will try again"}
