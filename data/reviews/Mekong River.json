{"text":"After seeing many great reviews I decided to take my husband and our son there last night. We ordered 4 dishes which came with large amount of noodles and rice but in contrast the meat portion in each dish was really tiny. It was mainly eating noodles with sauces. The ambience was okay."}
{"text":"Recently moved to Etobicoke from downtown Toronto and have been seeking out a great Pho spot. Our favourite spot downtown is Golden Turtle on Ossington. Didn't think I'd find anything comparable but then we came across Mekong and was pleasantly surprised. A clean restaurant, great service, and most importantly, delicious broth. Highly recommend this place for anyone looking for great authentic vietnamese food."}
{"text":"Great fusion Vietnamese food in the area. I also love their avocado and coconut shake! Staff is good and price is great too."}
{"text":"The pho here is the best I've had in Etobicoke! The staff is nice, the service fast and the pho is always consistently amazing.I keep on meaning to try something else on the menu but find it hard to say no to my regular order.   The only reason I didn't give 5 stars was because the spring rolls look and taste to me like they are made from frozen.  Take the Vietnamese spring rolls from Pho House down the road and the rare beef pho from Mekong and you've got yourself the best meal for a rainy day"}
{"text":"Amazing pho! best I've ever tried! luv their food. the place is ok. good for casual family outings."}
{"text":"Inside decor looks much better than outside facade. Nice and clean and modern looking inside. Chairs are very cushiony!! Most delicious Pho meal in a long time. Absolutely delicious!!"}
{"text":"I had the tom yum seafood noodle soup. They're so good, I keep coming back here just for that. It's sweet sour and bit spicy all at the same time."}
{"text":"This is the only place my parents will eat pho outside of home. The restaurant is charming, the service is a bit slow, but they are considerate, and the food is good for outside viet cuisine. Considering how bad viet restaurants are these days (to the point that my family cannot swallow it down), it's nice to find a place we can go to when we're lazy to cook."}
{"text":"I frequent Mekong River at least once a month and they are generous with their meat portion for the Pho (I typically get the house special, or the rare beef and tripe). You can't order a small pho for take out, only medium and large.  Their fried spring rolls are very good also. Not as great as the golden turtle (on Ossington), but really good for Etobicoke!  The Vietnamese cold coffee is really good also.  The only thing I would give a lower rating would be their milkshakes. I've had the mango a few times and it's not bad... but not as good as your better Pho joints."}
{"text":"Average food and bad service. Not impressed. Missing ingredients.  I ordered Pho soup with noodle, rare beef, tripe. Soup came without tripe. Mistake. I did not complain, because I ordered more food and I didn't wanted extra spit on it.  Not recommended."}
{"text":"We went here on a recommendation from friends (always a good sign) and now it's our favorite local spot. The pho is DELICIOUS, the mango salad excellent, the fresh rolls tasty, the sizzling beef was very good and battered squid gets me thinking about it and making me want to go back time and again!! Don't get me wrong, it's slightly westernized and nothing you haven't had before, but I am a huge fan of that rare beast, consistency, plus it's sooo cheap. The two of us go and gorge ourselves and struggle to spend more than thirty dollars, so there's plenty left over for a nice tip, which they definitely deserve. Like I said, not haute cuisine but a nice cheap eat, for groups or couples. There's a TV so it's not romantic, but it's fun to half watch what's on and just talk about the stupid headlines on CP24...."}
{"text":"I am writing this as I sit in the restaurant on a Saturday night. I just finished a mediocre meal and here are my thoughts on this place:   - Service is so slow. I asked for a glass of water and it took more about 10 minutes for the server to bring it out. There were two tables that left because they had waited so long for their food to come out. I think our food took over 30 minutes to come out which is super slow for a Vietnamese restaurant. This isn't high end fine dining so there is no reason for it to come out so slow.  - Service is bad. When the food finally came out, my husband had gotten the wrong order. He ordered #143 and I wrote down \"143\" on the order slip and they brought out #146.  They kept insisting that we ordered 146 and I said I know I wrote down \"143\". They finally admitted they were wrong and took back the wrong dish which meant he had to wait for the right order to come out. And no apology was offered.  - Food is ok. I order chicken and spring roll vermicelli. The food was extremely sweet and salty (msg?). The chicken was overcooked and really dry. It was not appetizing and I had difficulty eating it. By this point I just wanted to leave.  - Atmosphere and decor are nice and the restaurant is clean. I think this is the only thing it has going for it.   We left immediately after we finished eating and it took an hour and half from the time we arrived to the time we finished eating .  The restaurant was quite busy but I noticed people waiting long for their meals. I did ask why it took so long and the cashier said they were having technical problems in the kitchen. It would have been really nice if they had told us that from the beginning.   I don't recommend this place. We could have driven to Mississauga and had better Vietnamese food with better service and better value (better quality, tastier and bigger portions) been back to Etobicoke in less time than it took for this bad meal.   I've been here a couple of times before and I must have forgotten why I don't come here that often and would rather drive out to Mississauga for Vietnamese food. Today's experience has reminded me how bad it is and I will never return."}
{"text":"Hard to find a restaurant in the Etobicoke area that serves authentic pho. The taste and quality of the soup, noodles and meat were great, I cannot speak greatly for the quantity - for a medium, I got a \"small\" sized portion compared to what you would get at Markham pho restaurants. I got the house special, they gave me half of one meatball and 3 meat slices with 1 tendon piece and a sad excuse for a piece of tripe. My partner who got rare beef and meatballs only, got 2 meatballs cut into quarters and 4 meat slices. They were really skimping out on the meat and noodles. In a rectangular take-out box, it was 1/3 filled with noodles and meat with soup and veggies on the side."}
{"text":"I dIscovered Mekong River on my drive out of Toronto. Usually I'm staying in the city, but I had a pho craving while driving back stateside. Yelp brought me to Mekong River. I was a bit worried about it being a \"pan-Asian\" restaurant, having an all-encompassing menu, but not specializing in one particular cuisine.   However, I had nothing to worry about as their Vietnamese food was excellent. I ordered a House Pho along with fried spring rolls. Their pho had a flavorful meaty broth with generous amounts of meat. I also found the beef to be of high quality with a good amount of marbled fat on the brisket and still some pink on the steak. The spring rolls were also really good. Super crispy without being oily and served with lettuce, pickled julienned carrots and daikon. Simple, but very well done.   Service was friendly and food came up promptly. Pricing was fair and portions were good. Overall, Mekong River is a great Vietnamese option in the area. I would return without hesitation."}
{"text":"Agreed - best pho in Etobicoke (though the available choices in Etobicoke is relatively small). Staff always friendly and helpful. Though sometimes you feel they are a little overwhelmed during busy hours (weekday lunches) which causes a bit of a delay in ordering / paying."}
{"text":"So it's New Year's Day evening and we we felt like something soupy. Koreans like soup for hangovers. My favorite place in Sauga (Pho Hung) was closed so we decided to chance it on a random place near Kipling Station.   We pull up and it's completely empty. Not even a car in the lot. Another bad omen: the sign touts them as \"asian fusion.\" I would normally turn around immediately but we are hungry and out of options. The interior is nicer than most Vietnamese places.   The menu has your typical Viet items as well as a Thai menu.   - Mango Chicken Salad Julienned mango, red onion, cilantro, carrots and small chunks of chicken.  A little too sweet for me but overall will def order it again. Maybe ask for less of the dressing next time. Big enough for the 3 of us to have plenty each.  - Spring Rolls. My brother said he liked them more than usual.   - Vietnamese Pancake I highly recommend this item. It's an egg crepe filled with mostly cooked bean sprouts. It's served with pickled daikon and carrots, basil and  mint. you wrap it all up in green leaf lettuce and dip it in tangy sweet (but a little more syrupy than I like)  sauce. Another great dish to share.   - Pho  Better than many places. Fresh. The broth was very clean and not too oily.   Super happy to discover good Vietnamese food in Etobicoke!"}
{"text":"Best Pho in Etobicoke! We have lived here for 7 years and have tried every pho restaurant.  This is hands down the best.  The crispy spring rolls and mango salad are great too.  They have Thai and Chinese options on the menu as well."}
{"text":"Came here on a Friday with some friends looking for a quick, easy, late dinner. In an area near the subway with mostly fast food places, this place I would consider in between because of the types of dishes available.   I saw it like a typical soup noodle quickie type restaurant dressed up a little better. The atmosphere can be loud as the restaurant is quite small; I realize my party was the loudest. Service was warm and welcoming, and the restaurant was clean with a nice atmosphere. The washrooms however were small as it was one stall which required a key.  I ordered a simple pork and chicken with rice dish. It was nothing special; actually I had better ones in the \"lesser\" viet restaurants I've been to. The chicken was ok but the pork was a little tough. Overall the taste was ok. I looked around the table and saw the others who ordered had very elaborate dishes ranging from simple pho noodle soup and pad thai. Perhaps I should have went for those specialty dishes instead. I'd come again to try the other dishes however as the experience here was more positive than negative."}
{"text":"I always get the grilled pork bun (cold noodle, veggies, grilled pork, peanuts, fish sauce and spring roll on the side) for $7.50 and grilled pork meat ball cold rolls under $ 5- great appetizer for 2 people."}
{"text":"Both Phos and Thai dishes our group had were excellent and tasted authentic. The place is open late on Sunday which is a clear advantage, as initially we chose another place but it was closing at 5 same as many other restaurants in the area, hence 5 stars! Keep up the good service and business hours!"}
{"text":"Love this place. For the adventurous the House Special Pho is a small masterpiece.  Today I had minced shrimp baked on real sugar cane."}
{"text":"Great food, great price, so many options. Have gone here twice with my boyfriend, and he's even gone once with his mom. Would definitely return again for a nice meal :)"}
{"text":"I've been going here for years now and their pho is the best i've ever had in Toronto! Everything tastes so fresh and the portions are great for a good price as well ($8 for medium pho that fills me up completely). Wait staff is friendly and convenient and the restaurant itself is actually very nice inside. Great little place in the heart of etobicoke that any pho lover needs to try!"}
{"text":"It's a bit small for a pho place but clean.  Service is friendly as well. I ordered the fresh shrimp rolls and those were okay, and the peanut sauce was very tasty.  I also ordered the rice with grilled pork, fried egg and steamed crab meat.  I love either a properly cooked overeasy or sunny side up egg, so that the yolk runs over the rice and makes it so much tastier.  The egg was somewhat overcooked and it wasn't runny enough for my liking.  While the pork chop was fresh, it was pretty bland, as was the crab meat.  Not the biggest fan of this place and I'd rather go to Pho Mi 99."}
{"text":"\"The spacious inside had a large opening in the middle of the room. We noticed also three different types of tile throughout and granite-imitation veneer tables. \" \"The Mango dish had sour sweet sauce with a hint red pepper flakes floating around. There was plenty of sauce in which julienned slices of carrot, mango and onion floated. The dish was topped with a crispy chicken fillet, which was a bit on the dry side however the sweet and sour sauce all around made up for it.\"  A few bites from our full experience.."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for years. Still the best pho I have ever had. Make sure to treat yourself to the fried banana ice cream. It's one of my favourites. The staff is friendly and the place is clean."}
{"text":"Good portion to price ratio.  The quality is there as well. The restaurant is neat and tidy."}
{"text":"Great pho, some of the best I've ever had! The pad thai is quite tasty as well. Quick service, polite staff, nice and clean inside. The only thing is that sometimes they play weird fantasy video game sounding music in the background, it can be a bit distracting. Other than that, a great find!"}
{"text":"We had shrimp fried rice and sweet and sour chicken. Very small portions but delicious. There are better restaurants if you want to venture into Toronto. We will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Consistent.. Easily one of (the?) best pho in Etobicoke. The staff are organized, fast, friendly. Prices are good/average. Sure beats the HORRENDOUSLY AWFUL Pho House (at 6 points plaza). Only real negative; horrible music, usually sounds like a soundtrack to an awful role playing game/Final Fantasy.  Also tables are close, if it's busy; it's loud."}
{"text":"The pho here is really tasty . The mango salad is amazing as is the pad that ! I love there fried tofu aswell , it's probably one of the best I've tried . Atmosphere is nice as the place is clean . I've been here a few times and never had any problems with food at all everything is always tasty . The service can be a little slow at times but that's ok asking as your not in a rush !"}
{"text":"Good service. was seated right away. I ordered grilled beef and chicken with rice. The chicken is a little dry to my liking. Prices are reasonable. Don't mind coming back again if I am in the area."}
{"text":"Best beef vermacelli bowl in the neighbourhood!!! (Lots of fresh mint, green onions, and carrot/daikon pickles -- yum!).  There was no great place for Vietnamese food in Etobicoke until Mekong River came along...so this has become a favourite of ours for takeaway.  We love the food here and the prices are really reasonable!!! We just wish they still did delivery!!!!!  If you are looking for a casual dinner that is value-for-money and tastes good, this is the place to be!!!!!"}
{"text":"I'm gonna be real right now - Mississauga has the best pho restaurants of all time (Kanye moment, sorry Mekong).  But I must say, if you are craving a bowl of some warm goodness and you're in Etobs, I would highly suggest you go over to Mekong. Their pho is not the absolute greatest but it hits the spot.  Oh, and I completely agree with Owen - this place is 1000000x better than Pho House in six points plaza."}
{"text":"Syrupy sauces.Thin shaved beef on hot plate . Salty Pho reflecting carton or tin. All LOADED with MSG.Pleasant environment. Fresh shrimp rolls ;bland on bland.  No no no."}
{"text":"I can't believe Mekong River has been opened for so long and I've never been there until a few weeks ago!  A couple of girls from the office, who live in the hood suggested we go there for lunch.  We ordered Fresh Grilled Chicken Rolls, Mango Salad (best I've ever eaten), Pad Woon Sen (with shrimp) and Stir-fried Beef with Vegetable in a Satay Sauce.  Everything was like something I never tasted - very authentic with exceptionally good quality - I've been craving that Pad Woon Sen (glass noodle) dish since I left!  Service was super friendly and the restaurant itself was very clean.  Five ++ stars all the way!!!"}
{"text":"The pho with beef was amazing. The prices are good in general and the food is great. Very very glad we found this place."}
{"text":"Best pho in the neighbourhood! Don't have to go to Mississauga anymore! Pho prices are also reasonable. Other dishes such as the pad thai, curry, or fried rice are decent. Decor inside is surprisingly nice."}
{"text":"J'ai allé a Mekong River pour le déjeuner avec un ami. Il y avait des déjeuner spécialitiés, et j'en avais un. Ce n'était pas bon et pas mal. J'ai eu mieux et j'ai eu pire.   Si vous avez un voiture et beaucoup de temps, je recommanderais d'aller ailleurs."}
{"text":"Sooo good!  My mouth is watering just thinking about the food here.  I've been here quite a few times and it has yet to fail me.  I usually get something Viet while my bf opts for pad thai.  Pho is a bit cheaper AND fresher than other places.  Furthermore, I haven't detected any use of MSG!  Vermicelli dishes are soo flavourful, down to the marinated meat.  Don't tell anyone this, but the pad thai here is better than a certain place, just down the street.  Shhh..."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times, and I can't say they have been positive experiences. While the food is quite tasty, the service is terrible.   Whenever I have gone there, something comes late or not at all. We've had to remind them about drink orders, people's main courses have arrived well after others have received theirs, and trying to pay the bill always takes forever.   While I enjoy their food, I don't see myself eating in the restaurant again. Maybe their take-out is the better option."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch. Got the pho house special. Not a fan of their pho. The meat tasted so stale and off that it aftected the meal. And very few toppings! Would not recommend this. Their deep fried banana is the bomb tho."}
{"text":"This is a late review. Went for lunch here Summer 2015. They use MSG! My dad & I had lunch & loved the food but 30 mins later we were not feeling too good & TMI.....  We both had the runs.  Which is too bad as the food tasted good. We haven't gone back."}
{"text":"This was our first visit to Mekong River. We went for lunch today (Monday around 12:30pm). The restaurant was quite busy with only 2 free tables.  We sat down and waited around 10 minutes until a pot of tea was delivered. It was only then that the waitress realized we didn't have an order slip on our table, so she got one for us right away. Our order was collected after about 5 more minutes, so this is already very slow as compared to other Viet. restaurants in that area. Granted, this restaurant is Viet./Thai/Chinese so not strictly Vietnamese.  I ordered a small bowl of pho with brisket and beef balls (only $7, so not bad). My husband ordered the My Tho style seafood soup with glass noodles ($9). We also ordered the crispy shrimp spring rolls ($5.50) to share.  The My Tho soup came first, followed by the spring rolls. My pho came about 5 minutes later (not unusual for our local Viet. style restaurants).   The My Tho was quite small in comparison to other local places, but had a fair amount of seafood in it. The broth was quite bland, so my husband had to add some fish sauce. Otherwise, he enjoyed it.  The shrimp spring rolls were delicious! They were definitely the best part of the meal and I'd order them again although they were a bit small for the price.   The small pho was just right for the price. It was very tasty and had a good amount of brisket and 4 meat balls. I have no complaints about it. I also got a good amount of Thai basil, bean sprouts and lime on the side.   When we first arrived there was no sambal oelek, sriracha or hoisin on the table, but she brought some right after our food arrived.  All in all, it was a good experience. The only thing I'd be eager to return for is the crispy shrimp rolls as we can get much better pho and my tho style soup closer to home, but I wouldn't discourage anyone from visiting Mekong River. The food isn't bad at all and the restaurant seemed clean. The service wasn't bad either. All in all, middle of the road as local Asian restaurants go."}
{"text":"Amazing food, have been going here for a very long time. The owner and staff are increasingly friendly. Food is delicious and fresh."}
{"text":"Loved the food and the ambiance of this restaurant. From the outside it doesn't look like much, but the inside was really cozy and, although casual, the decor was appropriate for a nice sit down dinner. I base my ratings for Vietnamese cuisine according to their grilled chicken and rice or vermicelli. So I ordered the grilled chicken with rice and added an egg with an additional charge. My friend got the Pad Thai. The service was a bit slow and the food took a bit longer than other Viet restaurants I've been to, but considering the fully occupied restaurant, I understood. The server was friendly, nevertheless. The portion sizes were good and the chicken was excellent...not too greasy (as I've experienced in the past). My dish was also served with a side of pho broth, which according to the server, was to be eaten with the rice. This was something that has never been served at other restaurants that I have been to. Although I still do prefer the flavour of the lemongrass grilled chicken from Pho mi 99 at Latimer, this chicken had a different seasoning which was good too for a change.  The Pad Thai was also really enjoyed. By the time we were done with dinner the waiting line for a table had significantly increased, which goes to show it's popularity. I really enjoyed this place and will definitely return."}
{"text":"The lunch specials are great. For under $12 with tax u get a few options on lunch menu plus a spring roll, soup AND sofa pop!  Only prob I have is with their pho, they totally skimp on the meat. I ordered the \"special\" which typically comes with all the \"meats\". I may have gotten couple slices of beef, 2 sprigs of tripe, a half slice of tendon and half, yes half a measly little beef ball!  Other than them skimping out on the meats in their pho, the many other dishes I've tried there are tasty and decent portioned."}
{"text":"Clean fresh food! We have eaten here many times and it is our go to Vietnamese restaurant when we are craving Pho or Bun.  Clean environment great service and delicious food.  Must try if your in the area."}
