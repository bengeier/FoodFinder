{"text":"The quailty of food was exelent but we had to wait half hour for our food and the server wasnt as profesional as he should be .i had to complain many times .call manager but its not working ."}
{"text":"Have been driving by this place for a long time and finally had the opportunity to eat here Saturday night. 

The set up is, you place your order and find your own seating type of place and retrieve your food when ready. 

The steak dinner on the menu caught my attention right away. I was a little hesitant about it because most of the reviews suggested a sandwich instead.  Told my friend to get sandwich but both of us decided on the samething. 

8oz with salad (choice of ceasar, greek or house) and fries for $17.95.  Steak was cooked very well.   Seasoning was good too.  Salad was very fresh and the fries were a little boring.  No dinner roll :(

The price was a bit expensive for an 8oz steak but, the quantity of the meat and freshness of salad compensated for the price in a way. 

I don't think I'm wrong to say that most people would rather spend $17.95 (on a steak dinner) in a restaurant setting instead.  

Will I come back... yes.  I need to try one of their sandwiches.  It might change my rating for them, so stay tuned for my update on this place."}
{"text":"My first time there. Got 2 burgers to go. Good  and fast service. They just forgot to put sauteed mushrooms in one burger .... ooops! So please check your order !!!! Not a very happy customer."}
{"text":"Excellent lunch meal. Steak in the sandwich was tender. Love that beef. Large portion. Attentive service. I will be back."}
{"text":"Meh.

Not bad, but at seventeen bucks for a Kobe burger, fries and coke, it should be way better than meh. I doubt I'll return."}
{"text":"Let me start out by saying that I've been to Prime Beef Bistro at least 15 times in the past 2 years, I used to love this place! When it first opened it was a small diner with amazing burgers/fries and no dedicated servers. Since then they've done quite a bit of renovations to the restaurant, changed the menu a bit, and added a wait-staff. As a result, the average price for a meal here has sky-rocketed. I used to be able to buy a burger and fries for $15, now, the cheapest burger on the menu is $22 (6oz). There are no appetizers under $15 ($13 for a house salad though, I'll give them that!) and an entrée will cost you at least $45. I don't mind paying extra for great food but if you're going to be a premium restaurant which caters to an \"Elite\" clientele, every aspect of my dining experience with you had better be ON POINT.

Guess what? Prime Beef Bistro is not. Here's a couple things which really grind my gears.

The house water is tap water, it's also room temperature and served to you without any ice. It's served to you in a Dollarama jug to be poured into your Dollarama glass. Prices these guys charge, I should at bare minimum be entitled to cold water -- but realistically the water should be filtered water, served with ice and garnished with lemon. I very rarely order a non-alcoholic beverage from a restaurant so this is a big deal to me.

The utensils are the cheapest money can buy, not even stainless steel. You can see heat stains and residue on the utensils which wouldn't happen on quality cutlery. Why am I paying an arm and a leg to cover your 'fancy' Dollarama and IKEA reno?

The wait-staff are very annoying and constantly fishing for tips. Always trying to make unnecessary small-talk and asking me \"how is everything\" every 2 minutes. You sometimes get a couple different servers doing this, which makes it even worse. I understand a good waiter needs to check on his/her tables often but if I just ordered a burger and a water, I'm all set for at least 10 minutes. Don't talk to me when I'm mid-bite halfway through my burger, or in the middle of a conversation with my s/o, thanks.

Now that that's off my chest, I'll get to the food. The portions are large and the beef here is second to none. It's always cooked near perfectly; satisfying and delicious. The french fries recipe has changed and they are not nearly as good as they used to be. They aren't the worst I've had but could certainly be better, since they in fact used to be better at this location. It does look like they make them from scratch in-house though, which I do respect. The \"home fries\" which are something you get with their Breakfast offerings, are amongst the best I've ever tried. I was pleasantly surprised by them the last time I ordered a Western Omelette (which was also amazing) -- they should try cooking their french fries the same way, they'd be perfect. Their Apple Coleslaw which is a common free side-dish, is pretty terrible imo. They use yogurt instead of mayo as the base, which is fine, but it's just not very tasty with their current recipe. Condiments are fantastic -- they have a few different kinds of Aoili on hand, great for dipping fries in!

Overall Prime Beef Bistro is not a restaurant you will leave and feel disappointed with because of the food. You'll be well fed and the main course will be delicious.

+2 for excellent food
+1 for food being plated in a reasonable time
-2 for the \"experience\" being less than stellar

Happy Eating"}
{"text":"Kobe steak eggs benedict for breakfast!  This must be one of the only places in Toronto serving this dish.  Highly decadent and utterly delicious.  The steak was perfectly cooked to medium rare as requested, and the eggs benedict did not disappoint.  

There were a lot of great options on the breakfast menu.  I hope to visit again to try the Belgian waffle + eggs benedict combo, which sounded like it would be a perfectly balanced combo."}
{"text":"Organic, GMO/Antibiotic free meat at a decent price... And the quality is second-to-none. The burgers are fantastically portioned, and they've got amazing cheesecake for desert (amazing as well). 

The staff are lovely, and they make great lattes!"}
{"text":"The food here is very good and the quality of the meat is great which is why I am very disappointed the last 2 times I have come here to eat. The service has gone downhill. I ate here last night with my family. We were seated promptly and provided 2 menus. When the rest of our party arrived we had to ask for more menus and an extra table. It's as if no one was really paying attention. We ordered zucchini wedges and when we got them, were not offered small plates and had to use napkins to place food on. I had to call the attention of the servers who were behind the counter not paying attention. All the food except my dad's meal came out and normally good should come out at the same time. No one explained why the food took so long to come out. The server never came to ask if we needed anything and they seemed so distracted and not efficient at all. Very disappointing since our first 3 visits we had a great server who explained the meat and where it came from and How delicious various dishes were and made suggestions to us. This is why we kept coming back. When it was time to pay another server handed me the bill and the credit card machine without punching in the amount. I could have put any amount I wanted! I couldn't figure it out and asked the server if I was supposed to put the amount in myself. She smiled and said \"yes\". Finally we figured out she needed to put a code in before I paid. What kind of amateur staff is this? The restaurant is not a cheap fast food establishment but I was disappointed in the service of the staff the last few times. Not sure I will be going back because of this frustration."}
{"text":"We went to Paradise last night because my brother absolutely loves it. I have eaten there once before and found it not impressive. 

Last night I went again. I am gluten free and was shocked at their lack of awareness despite marketing their gourmet, organic approach. 

They do offer gluten free buns, but proceeded to cut it with the same knife as other buns and toast it in the same toaster. I stopped them, and told them that I am very allergic to gluten and that they need a fresh knife and cannot toast it if they do not have a separate toaster (like Hero and South Street both do). They looked at me in disbelief. 

I am not sure why restaurants offer a gluten free option if they are not well trained in how to keep it safe for me. They took my burger behind the counter, I couldn't see it being cooked. I watched her handle it with what I thought might have been the same gloves she used to handle the other burgers, even after I told her that would make me sick. At Hero and Southstreet, I know for sure that they have been trained in the requirement to CHANGE your gloves between handling gluten and non gluten buns.  I hoped that I had just not seen her change her gloves--and didn't have them make a new one. I regret this. I have been sick all morning because of this place. 

The burger was tasty, I had a kobe burger, but not worth the pain it caused me this morning because of their lack of gluten intolerance training.

I appreciate that I have severe allergies and this isn't the norm, but I eat at Hero and Southstreet on the regular, and rarely if ever get sick from contamination of gluten. I also eat at pizza places regularly which are obviously packed with flour, and even they have the proper precautions to make sure I don't get sick.

The burger was VERY expensive (more than 10 bucks for a 6 oz...small...burger) and I was not impressed that they offer a GF burger option without being sufficiently trained in how to make sure it's actually GF. I don't recommend going here if you have a gluten allergy; don't be fooled by the GF bun option, it's not worth it!"}
{"text":"Nice little restaurant! Burgers are great and affordable ($10 burger and fries). It's clean and spacious. Also has plugins, wifi and comfortable couch for surfers. Staff are really nice too!"}
{"text":"Good spot for a weekend lunch. Usually not very busy. You can also order coffee/tea . Not a bad spot to do some work or study on weekends."}
{"text":"Okay. First of all, let me tell you that I have been to many burger restaurants in my short 40 years of eating moo. Now let's cut to the chase.  My wife and I shared two 9 oz Angus burgers with onion rings and fries. The burgers taste like a nice backyard burger with quality meat. The gourmet toppings and sauces are great. 

We were going to share it with our 2 year old son, but to my surprise and disappointment they didn't have any high chairs. To make it worse the manager didn't really care. This older woman must not have children. The customer service needs major improvement. 

Overall, the food was decent, but FIVE GUYS serves up a better tasting burger in a more family friendly environment.  In addition, SOUTH STREET has a great burger and a friendly attitude. 

There are an abundance of fast casual burger joints in Toronto. Get your customer service right Shane or just leave it to those burger places that already do it well and just concentrate on real-estate. Also what's with the coffee?"}
{"text":"I have tried the Kobe and the Highland burgers here and they were both delicious! I think the Highland is leaner (less marbling for sure) and it has become my go-to when I get a meat craving. I absolutely love caramelized onions on my burgers, and when you mix that with the fact that this meat is top notch, you get a winning burger.

It's very clean inside and when the weather is nice the patio is an added bonus.

Shane Baghai: top notch buildings and beef."}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised to see they had veggie burgers and really surprised at how great it was. Its black bean based and has an excellent crust all around it. Will definitely come back for another."}
{"text":"I used to love this place before when they had good service but today i came here
The server didn't ask if i want breakfast or lunch just assumed i want lunch and brought me the menu. Then didn't ask how i want my steak or my eggs or even my potatoes!!!!! Just assumed!!! Now i have beef bacon ! And raw steak sitting on my table that I didn't even touch !!! And they don't take any responsibility 
Worst costumer service"}
{"text":"Good burger. More gourmet style than greasy American style. Nice clean place to chill."}
{"text":"Is this place....

A BURGER JOINT??

A CAFE??

A BAKERY??

OR 

A STEAKHOUSE??

I've tried the BURGER, STEAK & SAUSAGE, and for the price you would think it would have been better than it is was. OVERRATED I must say...and all the meat tasted fried, not grilled...

And the big question is... why would you dress a burger with out the meat in the bun?

Talk about a saugy ketchup soaked bread that didn't even touch the meat..."}
{"text":"I went in really looking forward to this place since it is under the brand of Shane beghai who is well known for his luxurious line. Unfortunately, it did not meet the expectation that I came in with. I was waiting a very long time and the serve was unorganiZed. Finally, I ordered mozzarella sticks, a Philly cheese steak and my husband ordered the hen.  We got our order after a long wait, but it was MISSING the mozzarella sticks, so I asked the server what happened to the appetizer that we order (since we eat that before our meal) he was so lost and said oh you ordered mozzarella sticks? I said yes and confirmed with my husband in case I had missed it. He said he will bring them out. I began to eat my Philly cheese stake and realizes it lacked the ingredients mentioned on the menu. I brought this to the servers attention who said he can get it remade or I can order something eles. I decided to order something else since the Philly cheese case had no taste and I was already upset with experience I had with it. I ordered a burger instead. The chef came out and was VERY nice about it and apologized.  I also got my mozzarella sticks finally, but unfortunately they were COLD from the inside. I had to tell them this since my daughter would not eat. Old mozzarella sticks, I felt terrible complaining. Anyways the chef were able to correct the order and was deeply sorry about what happened. Then we went ahead and ordered the dolce de latte cheese cake which was amazing along with an espresso for my husband and a coffee for myself. Again, the server brought a late for my husband and coffee for me. We did tell him again, maybe he was not all there that day. Anyways the whole
Experience that I had coming in did not meet the expectations for me."}
{"text":"Wow things have changes since my last review - from just a coffee/dessert place to a full fledged restaurant and bar.

The latest updates are:

This is now a sit-down with wait-service restaurant. Paradise has really fancified this place (proper table cloths and cutler to boot). There is a bar and if you feel like ordering bottles of wine, you can actually choose from either a Barolo or a Chateuneuf-du-Pape!! 
At times, I do miss the grab-and-go-sit-yourself-down as it was a great place to grab a quick bite. 

The meat store is now beside the restaurant and lots of fresh cuts to choose from. The head butcher mentioned that if you don't see a particular cut, there is no problem for you to make a special order.

Service is amazing! Food is still great! And now serving breakfast and lunch."}
{"text":"My husband and I came out for lunch and we were very pleased with the attention and the quality of this restaurant. The atmosphere was really calm with a nice and relaxing background music. The food was excellent; however we believe it is a little bit overpriced! I had the Paradise Steak frites with sweat potato fries and my husband had the 10oz Rib eye steak with vegetables and ceasar salad! Overall a good experience!
Might come back!"}
{"text":"While the waitstaff were nice (maybe incompetant),  our main course came luke warm. They forgot some of the appetizers, they only brought half the meal (the meat without sides or sauces) they brought the sides and sauces for the meat cold and after we had finished most of the meal. Our beef short rib was quite bland and very fatty. The steaks were ordered medium rare but were way too charred on the outside. We then complained and they offered us free dessert and later came back, after we were finished the desserts, and told us oh no they had meant to say our table of 10 only got one dessert of the 4 options (so total of 4 comped desserts). 

Overall what was supposed to be a nice family dinner turned out to be a very dissapointing and frustrating evening. Overexpensive, and not worth the time or money."}
{"text":"I used to go there all the time with my friends but they've changed everything and everything was a lot better before , the food quality, the customer service and the decor , I love the place but it's not as good as before"}
{"text":"Went back for the steak (Chateaubriand). The steak was done a bit towards medium well or well (I ordered medium). The server offered to redo a steak, but I declined.

Went there with 5 other people. Someone everyone thought the steak/burgers weren't as great as last time. I wonder if it's the cook that night who screwed everything up.

The server (Chris) is an awesome guy.

Conclusion: First time I had steak, and it wasn't that good. I'm reluctant to try again...

7/10 for quality. 8/10 for value. 9.5/10 for service. 8/10 overall (not an average)."}
{"text":"OH EM GEE! This was one of the best burgers I've ever had! Hands down! Game over! Read some awesome reviews and was in the area, so figured I'd check it out!

A corner spot in a bunch of condos with a larger space than I thought, this was a nice spot to get some food! Wasn't busy at all when we went on a Monday night, so got a table right away!

I already knew what I wanted before I arrived, so got our order in right away. Decided I'd go for the all-famous Chateau Burger (Kobe Burger), and let me tell you, it was AMAZING! A huge patty, all dressed up with your choice of sauce. I went for the Basil Pesto, which was great, but may go for the Dijon Mustard next time. A little messy to eat, but came on a beautiful ciabatta bun, with tomatoes, lettuce, cheese, and bell peppers. Definitely one of the best burgers I've ever had!

Pretty good service as the place was pretty much empty, but quick staff overall. Just needed to ask for more water at one point...

Nothing better than a gourmet burger made from Kobe Beef. If you're a fan of good beef and good burgers, this is definitely one of the best places to go! Check it out!"}
{"text":"Not even worth to try. You pay 15 dollars for a small classic cheese  burger with no taste at all and cold fries."}
{"text":"Great service and great food!!! Best burger place in TO!
They offer a whole wide ranges of meat inspired dishes: burgers, hotdogs and sandwiches. They also have a great selections condiments.
Grain fed and hormone free meat. Pretty interesting story of how the company started.
Their soup and poutine were also excellent. Good selections of mini cakes as well.

But if you are in a hurry this is not the place to go. It takes around 10min to receive the food.

This place also offers free drinking water which is a plus for me."}
{"text":"Saturday night. Parking was a little scarce. They dress their waitstaff up nicely, but they aren't very proficient. They start by trying to take an appetizer order while we are being seated. I asked for a minute. 10 minutes later....

staff very slow..
Watched another table seated and served an appetizer that we have ordered before us. 
Pointed it out to the waiter....who seemed indifferent about it.

Slow slow slow!

Oh please....let the food be good.

The Food:
The steak came rare instead of medium rare. The food was tasty, but again marred by the staff not remembering I ordered wine with dinner. No 90 second check, food for one of the five of us came 8 minutes after everyone else's food, without apology or explanation.

One of the other staff tried bussing our table...very uncoordinated. We feared for plates dropping.

Really bad service. Waiter kept calling me friend. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"As it seems this place used to have been decent - judging by the past reviews but as of my own experience on a Sunday afternoon the most it deserves is 2 stars..

To be fair it is probably about 3 points on the absolute scale for the quality of food alone (not taking the price into account), but I take one extra point off for having been extremely disappointed by the mismatch to my expectations, which was not helped by absolutely indifferent staff..

First , the price rating in Yelp is $$ which usually indicates $10-18 range, that's wrong!
The cheapest burger on the menu was $22 and steaks and other mains were well into $30-$50 range .. That is at least $$$ territory..

For this price is expected to be impressed and ordered a $22 Kobe burger ..
Well it was very ordinary - and nothing special in taste except the amount of fat it contained ..  The burger was very fatty and \"nutritious\" if nutrition is defined by the amount of calories intake..

The burger toppings lacked flavour and were mashed into a fatty homogenous mix with no layering of flavours you get from the best of burgers ..
My taste buds felt absolutely no pleasure eating it.. The only thing helped me that I was very hungry and my empty stomach and reduced blood sugar levels were rejoicing .. But there was no way to hide how ordinary this burger was.. I'd say it is no better than any typical pubs burger at $11-15 except it was almost double in price.. I ate burgers at half the price that were better .. Other than excess of fat that famed \"Kobe\" beef added nothing ..nothing !
The fries that came with the burger were dry and over fried in what seemed like not-so-fresh oil , they didn't have much flavour either .. Just carbs and calories.. Again , the closest match -  pubs fare where you can at least wash all this junk with a pint.. I didn't order beer there - I was prepared to get pleasure from food.. This place is pretentious, it claims to be better than a pub ..
Another order at the table was from a \"breakfast menu\" - $16 Hash  beef.. Fatty fries , dry and lacking flavour .. Reminded me the typical \"continental\" breakfast at a cheap hotel .. Just to throw in some calories , add salt and pepper to your taste .. Unfortunately adding those didn't help much bidding the lack of flavour ..
 
Now I know I can eat here some junk food for twice the price of a typical junk food joint.. It is what it is..

To complement - staff with remote \"I don't care\" attitude .. They were polite but completely ambivalent , nobody paid any attention , after sitting for 5-10 minutes after the table was cleaned up nobody approached the table.. I had to ask explicitly for a bill . The washroom with some cosmetics from Dollarama..
Is this place for real?
Okay..

Let me summarize .
This place is a rip off to sell some junkish food at premium price ..
Sorry - to give it some credit , the interior and ambience is good, a lot better than a pub .. But - the food is junk !
Drive down a block or two by Sheppard to the nearest shawarma or burger place , have the same or better food for 1/2 or 1/3 price ..

This was my most disappointing dining experience of late .. I can't remember to be that disappointed and such a severe mismatch between Yelp ratings and the real world experience..
What happened to this place?
Did chef go on vacation ? Change of management?
I am prepared to write a disclaimer if somebody tells me what and why ..
For now - 2 stars and a BIG thumbs down .."}
{"text":"A nice change from other restaurant models. The service was friendly, the food was fresh, hot and tasty. The French fries are long, lean and totally delicious. Nice patio with pretty landscaping. Clean, contemprary decor inside with a secret nook at the back. Wine and beer with our yummy gourmet grilled slider burgers? We will be back!"}
{"text":"I had the koburger and my husband had the roast beef. The roast beef was cooked well however, not enough seasoning for the middle part of the steak. My burger however, was over cooked. You can tell the meat is good quality but it was over cooked and dry."}
{"text":"Great food and service. Priced fair for the portions you are given. Right on the highway so it is an easy stop."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place after reading the back story about how this place came to fruition but sadly, it's not to be.

I will start by saying the place is generally clean, has a neat order system where after you place your order, you are given a disc that vibrates and lights up when your meal is ready.  Also, the poutine is quite delicious.

Where this place lacks could be solely on personal preference, how the meat is cooked.  I prefer a medium-rare to medium cooked patty and on a flat-top grill.  I found the burger dry and overcooked and probably done on a grill. Since they also raise and source the meat, they should stand by the quality of their product and not need to overcook it unless the customer requests it.

In the end, the burger patty was quite bland and served on a cibatta bun when I think it would have been better served on an actual hamburger bun.  I guess since I'm paying $10 for my burger, might as well make it seem gourmet.

I did have the Highland burger and do like a good Kobe burger so there is the chance that I will be back to give it a try. I just won't be in a rush to do it."}
{"text":"Oh so magical! Is how I feel when I dig my teeth into one of the burgers this place whips up for me!!!! Amazing quality meat and a pleasant country vibe eating area! Absolutely love love love this little hidden gem!"}
{"text":"I have been to paradise several Times. The food is reliable and the atmosphere is pleasant. I find that the meat in particular is quite good. Consistent with the restaurants theme of having clean farm meat, It does seem to be tastier meet. In addition, I love their salads and their veggies. Both are also tasting quite fresh"}
{"text":"This review is 3.5 stars. 

     The workers are extremely friendly and professional. The inside is spotless and the food is good. I had their rib eye steak and fries. The steak was very well seasoned, but it was undercooked. My cousin recommended the wagyu steak patties and said they were superb. I bought a few boxes for my uncle and his family. The price and taste was good, but the only mistake I made was not reading the nutrition values of the burgers. Just 1 thin patty is 350 calories!!!! It would be one thing if the patty was thick, but it is really, really, REALLY THIN! When you add the calories of bread and other ingredients, it is over 550 calories for 1 homemade burger. In addition, I've had real wagyu beef, but the meat I bought didn't taste like it. Still, the taste was worth what I paid for. Overall though, place is worth going to, just make sure you read the nutrition value of the food before you buy it. This is a great place to take families or to go out with friends."}
{"text":"Restaurant with a good purpose. All healthy, organic, grass fed, nonGMO meats.  We've been here since they first opened and saw it grow from a diner unit a cozy restaurant. Extremely fair prices for wagyu beef, Kobe, angus. From steaks to burgers and sausages. We've tried it all and bought meat from the butcher area. 

As healthy and quality eaters, we absolutely love this place. Staff are knowledge and friendly 

Scott is fantastic."}
{"text":"Food was very good absolutely no complaints about the food. The female server was very kind and thoughtful. However, when we noticed floating sediment in all the water glasses and water table decanter and mentioned it to the bald male waiter/manager he simply made a joke and walked away. We were displeased with this response and were hoping for a better response and an offer for fresh, clean water so we made a second comment to him. His second response was more condescending and still uncaring and the result was again no offer of fresh water. Shame on this person and the training of staff at this restaurant. The end result of this experience is great food and fake, friendly, uncaring service."}
{"text":"Went here because the other place I wanted to eat lunch was closed today for some reason. (Punked)

Starving.  Hubby ordered the spaghetti bolognese (wasn't available), 2nd punk.  He opted for the pasta of the day.  

I ordered the Philly steak sandwich (sold out, 3rd punk) it was 12:45pm and they weren't even busy!

Service was decent and food came out at a reasonable time since they were I busy. I'll try them again but I have no desire really."}
{"text":"Not a lot of positive reviews recently. That might have something to do with the mostly Bridal Path crowd that comes here.

You get exactly what you pay for. An above average burger at an above average price. Still one of the better in the city.

You can get a reasonably affordable, fancy meal here."}
{"text":"I visited this place during a slow Wednesday for Lunch, being my first time I really didn't know what to expect. As I entered I was promptly greeting by the hostess and shown to my table. A short time after my server came and explained the processes of how they acquire they're meats (The owner of the restaurant also owns a farm). This very long story could've been shorted by simply saying our meats is Organic and locally grown. 

For my appetizer I had the \"featured\" Jalapeño Poppers which were okay but slightly disappointed as they tastes like the ones you can buy frozen at a grocery store. The only redeeming part was they were filled with Cream Cheese and not Cheese Sauce like some are. 

For my main I ordered the Chateau Burger. Generally speaking it is a very good burger, the beef patty was made from Kobe Beef and had a very nice texture to it. Having said that, as per my liking I found the burger to be a bit bland and would ask for a hot sauce to give it a kick. As my side I had the Onion Rings which were very good as they are made in-house, but next time is stick with the fries. 

My meal was finished off with a Coffee and Cheese Cake (Godiva Chocolate I think). Both were very good and can't really say more than that. 

All in all I would definitely recommend this place if you're looking to try a new spot for your beef fix. 

P.S they also have a selection of other dishes and you're able to purchase a selection of cuts from the in-store butcher."}
{"text":"A nice change from the typical fast food chain type of restaurants. The restaurant was very spacious and has a patio as well. 

The service is very friendly and they explain anything you might not be familiar with. The best part is the free toppings you can add onto your sandwiches and burgers  such as sautéed mushrooms, jalapeño peppers, guacamole, onions, lettuce, tomato, different sauces like ketchup, BBQ sauce, mustard, etc. There is additional cost for cheese though. 

The items on the menu is individual and is pricier than the typical burger but its more gourmet style. Expect to pay at least 7-12$ for a burger. They also have poutine, onion rings to order on the side as well. 

Ordering style is you have to order, they give you a buzzer and then you have to wait until your food is ready. 

The good: 
Free lemon water 
Clean bathrooms 
Customizing option 
Friendly service 
Free parking at the back 
The food is fresh! 

The not so good: 
Can be pricey 
Don't recommend the veggie burger 

Overall, I would give this a try! The beef has no additives and preservatives."}
{"text":"Used to go here before it rebranded as a higher end steakhouse restaurant. Wasn't the biggest fan before, but it's been a huge turn around. Came here when there was a huge wait at the nearby Keg, and it ended up being a blessing. 

The ambience is very relaxing, the dining area felt more spacious than it probably should, and the waitstaff was extremely friendly. 

We had the beef wagyu dumplings for an appetizer, and it was easily one of the best and most delicious things I've ever eaten... To the point that i will come here for them alone. 

I had the steak frites for entree and my girlfriend had the prime rib. Both entrees were excellent, with good portions. The chef came out of the kitchen to talk to us, and was very friendly and looking to provide the best dining experience for us. 

For a price better than the Keg, I left completely satisfied and will 100% return."}
{"text":"Our culturally diverse and international small group of 4 decided to try out Paradise Farms based on Yelp reviews I read -- and not the fact that two in our party actually lived three blocks away and have never tried it.

The P'Farms was great.  The burgers were of generous portion, great variety, and quick and prompt service -- not to mention prices around $13 for most selections (almost forgot I was in Canada,  let alone Toronto). 

One member of our clan exclaimed \"This menu is much more eclectic than I expected, \" which I don't know what that meant, but her tone of voice was pleased.  As the American in the group,  I was happy that the tables were of the same height in both the dining area AND the bar, you leg dangling high-top haters know what I mean."}
{"text":"When I used to live in the area, I would go there super early in the morning with my laptop to have breakfast and work done. Very pleasant and quiet.
Also, they have absolutely the best burgers, best fries and best mayo...!!! Thinking about them make me hungry!"}
{"text":"Oh what can you say about a burger that hasn't already been said. Everyone has their own special \"guy\" when it comes to burgers. So for now, this one is mine (locally). I ordered the Angus, and the hub ordered the Kobe. Both were very good. But, what really had me, and have been dying to go back for more, was the Paradise Poutine (with beef brisket)! I cannot say enough about how good it was. Absolutely amazing!!! So don't just go for a burger, you must have the poutine!
Their desserts are yummy too. :)"}
{"text":"Nice seating and decent food, but overpriced for what it is worth. Service was not the best. Interestingly we had a magician perform for us while we were there, which was kind of cool.

However, one particular item that I thought was done very well was the beef poutine. That would be the only thing I'd come back for."}
{"text":"My friends and I had an incredible experience at this restaurant!! The food was absolutely amazing! The bread to start was so unique and delicious. I ordered the beef brisket as my main, and it was so tender and flavourful! The portion was huge (everyone's portion was!), so much so that we all had takeout boxes for leftovers! The service was also spectacular and l we really felt valued as customers (the chef even came out to ask how our food was)! I will definitely come back again!"}
{"text":"Great burgers. Thick and juicy. An order of fries is a meal by itself. Orion rings big, thick and plentiful.  Best rings I've had in ages. The fish and chips would make Captain Highliner proud. The staff were polite and made our first visit fun. The prices are on the high side BUT you get what you pay for. Good quality and good quantity. 
We will definitely come again and bring our friends."}
{"text":"Great  KOBE BEEF burger !
Not cheap, but worth trying!"}
{"text":"Was recommended this place by a friend who enjoys his quality meat. Surprised I had not heard of this place sooner, given how close it is to where I live. Despite being near a major intersection, the storefront feels somewhat hidden away.

ATMOSPHERE:

The place is much larger than it appears from outside, and actually has several adjoined rooms leading to a small bar in the backroom. Not sure whether this place is going for an upscale kind of vibe, or a more casual atmosphere - either way, the prices are definitely upscale.

FOOD:

Unfortunately, the flagship \"Kobe burger\" was sold-out. The \"Stuffed Burger\" was a more than adequate replacement however. With two patties of Angus beef, stuffed with peppers, mushrooms, mozzarella cheese, and a list of other complimentary toppings (in this case, lettuce, tomato, and aioli sauce), this burger definitely was a feast for the taste buds.

The Buttermilk Battered Onion Rings were not quite what they were hyped up to be. They were much blander and thinner then expected, and only came with a few rings - this was disappointing given that this costed an additional $6 on top of the burger price. 

SERVICE:

The server/bartender was really engaging and attentive to our needs. He took the time to chat with us, answer questions about the backstory of the bistro and its owner, and even hunted down a sports channel for us as we sat by the bar. 

SUMMARY:

While the prices could definitely lower, the quality/taste of the meat and the strong service means that I will definitely be back here - still have to try that Kobe burger!"}
{"text":"Their breakfast menu is surprisingly delicious! I was not expecting really good food but I was definitely pleasantly surprised. I shared a Paradise Breakfast ($15) with beef sausage, two eggs, home fries and apple coleslaw, as well as strawberries and cream belgian waffle ($11). The home fries were lightly seasoned, which is always better than salt or ketchup, the apple coleslaw had plenty of onions, which was a cause for dislike among our group, but i thought it was delicious.

The Belgian waffles though, really won the prize here! It was so soft and so airy, and not at all sweet, which was perfect with syrup and whipped cream and strawberries. I was so happy eating it! 

The restaurant itself has a really fancy feel to it, and was mostly empty for a saturday. I would definitely recommend this place for breakfast or brunch if you are in the neighbourhood. Just watch out - this place is not actually inside bayview village, but down the street from it."}
{"text":"I had the roast beef and it was cooked masterfully. It was juicy and cooked medium.  My friend got the kobe burger and it was dry."}
{"text":"I heard about this place from a friend who is easily hyped about this sort of thing. The main concept of the cafe is that the beef is produced from cattle raised in a special farm owned by the owner, Shane Baghai. Now I am very cynical about words being thrown around loosely for the purposes of profit. For example, a big selling feature of their menu seems to be the \"Kobe\" beef. Kobe is one of the most deceptive terms in the food industry (synonymous with Champagne). It doesn't take a genius to know that you won't find Kobe beef in Toronto unless you are willing to meet with a sketchy Japanese man in a dark alley and give him a suitcase full of cash. With that said, I went along with it. I had a medium rare Kobe steak sandwich (burger and sausage also available). The sandwich alone was about $15. They had a wide variety of toppings to choose from. I though the dried shallots, sauerkraut, caramelized onions, and Dijon mustard would go well with my steak and wouldn't mask the flavour of the piece de resistance. All the cynicism aside, the meat was succulent and delicious, much like steaks I fry up at home for fraction of the price. To be fair, the owners do claim that they are selling a product that is local, environmentally friendly, and free of artificial hormone."}
{"text":"The alfajores cookie is soo decadent and delicious!! If you like dulce de leche and coconut as much as I do, you have to try one! They also carry a great selection of teas which can be made into a hot or cold drink. This is my go-to lunch place when I don't want to sit in the office.
They  make great salads, burgers and flat breads. The flat breads are freshly made and the brisket on it is very tender and juicy. The salads are never overdressed and the Cesar salad has bacon in it...not bacon bits, actual bacon!
There are many premium condiments to choose from to add to your burger free of charge (guacamole, crispy shallots, garlic aioli, smokehouse ketchup, etc.), where as it would be extra charges at other places.
There's also parking around the back, which is super helpful for where its located."}
{"text":"All these posters of pasture and logos about locally raised in Caledon, Ontario, 100% Angus Beef with no added growth hormones caught my eyes when I stepped inside Shane Baghai Paradise Farms Cafe.

Of course when the cashier asked what I want, I ordered then 6oz Angus Burger ($6.95) with a side of Homemade Buttermilk battered Onion Rings ($3.50).

I almost finished half of my Root beer before my order is ready. I do understand that it is cook when order, so don't come here and expect a quick lunch.

Free Toppings are quite unique with my favourite being Sauteed Fresh Mushroom, House Salsa,  Paradise House Guacamole, Caramelized Glazed Onion, extra Jalapeno pepper and I made myself a Mexican burger!

My burger was cooked medium with pink inside without asking, maybe it is standard.. so if you like your cooked to well done, please make sure you requested that. I personally find it is not too bad, but the patty is a little bland, a little mushy... and I was a little disappointed.

The onion ring I definitely won't order that again... for the price I paid I got 4 rings...and they weren't hot  anymore by the time I am eating them because my burger took so long to be cooked!

The set up of the cafe though is really nice. There are huge windows to look at on the busy traffic on Sheppard Avenue.  The patio has both shaded and sunny area too... but can be quite dusty from the exhaust systems from all the cars driving along Sheppard.

Free Parking at the back of the cafe, great if you are driving."}
{"text":"I love the food, the coffee and the service, it's that simple... the story of how the developer decided to buy a farm is really sweet! He did it all for his wife, who's a cancer survivor ...check out the story!  http://www.thestar.com/life/2012/03/12/shane_baghai_real_estate_mogul_turned_farmer_charges_into_torontos_burger_war.html"}
{"text":"Food took exceptionally long even though there was only one other table in the restaurant.. should've taken the hint.. glasses were dirty, waffles didn't come with the stated whipped cream and when we asked, we were told they didn't have any?  They brought old and odd looking ice cream instead.. garnishes of sprouts still had dirt on the end.. omelettes were small and runny and salad looked wilted.. the only good thing that was ordered was the fish and chips which were flaky and crispy and they gave a generous portion.. alfajore dessert was dry as dust, found flecks floating in my coffee.. waiter seemed unfamiliar with the menu and struggled to answer simple questions.. they automatically tacked on 20% gratuity for a larger group which is on the high side.. had the meal been memorable, I wouldn't have minded.. waste of money, dont bother coming here.. didn't try the steaks on the menu but for the price I saw, I rather go to a high end steak restaurant"}
{"text":"Service considering it was near closing time when we arrived (9pm on Friday) was good.  Not exemplary, but still good for 2 waiting staff members dealing with three groups with one being a large party.

Since it was also near closing time the Yorkshire pudding isn't as warm anymore, still good though.  I eat the thing nearly cold during lunch time when I come here and I am happy with it.

I ordered a 10 oz wagyu rib eye Chicago style medium rare and my friends ordered a 20oz Black Angus porterhouse.

What happened was there was an issue with the vent system in the kitchen that time and should the chef make my steak Chicago style it will make it very smokey in the restaurant so I told him it's fine not to make mine Chicago style.  In return he upgraded my friends' steak from Black Angus to Wagyu (w00t).  Thanks Chef!

The steak when it came out was so tender that considering they forgot to give us steak knives immediately we made do with the butter knives.  It still cuts cleanly though it with not much effort.

Comparing the porterhouse cut vs the rib eye cut.  I didn't really taste much difference nor feel the texture to be any different.  However, I didn't eat near the bone which I think would've tasted better.

For a tiny 10oz and the fact that it was 9pm and I was really hungry already, the meat was rich enough to satisfy my palate and I came out feeling satisfied meal wise.

However, there was one thing that was nagging on me during the meal.  Like something was missing but I couldn't put it while I was at the restaurant so I wasn't able to tell it then.  Though the waitress dealing with my table and the large party was busy she wasn't t really able to ask us during the time.

On my way home is when I remembered.  I didn't get too much of the savoriness of the meat that I was expecting from a wagyu class meat.  Maybe Paradise's wagyu isn't as fatty and not marbleized enough.  Or maybe because I ordered medium-rare or because of the cut I ordered (if it's because of these I hope someone comments back and tells me what level of doneness or cut I should ask for).  Regardless I didn't get that burst of fat glistening on my tongue feel that I got when I had wagyu back in the Philippines.

Sorry about the not so perfect review chef."}
