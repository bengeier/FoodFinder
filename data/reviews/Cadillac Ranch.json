{"text":"Everything about this place is awful. The food is gross & every single thing on the menu is horribly unhealthy. The service is terrible. Everything is overpriced. 

I've been here maybe 5 times & it's always because someone plans a happy hour & this is the place that they choose. I want to see my friends but I loathe having come here. And, I noted that other reviewers said they got sick - the first time I ever ate something here I got food poisoning!! I was at the movies after eating something here & had to leave & run home. Was sick all night, thought thankfully was better in the morning.

So last night I was here again to meet up with a bunch of friends & discuss a bachelorette party we were all planning. They have drink specials & discounted apps during happy hour BUT you have to be sitting outside to get them. Um, it was 55 degrees outside. The waitress then said we could sit at the bar, this was after we had been sitting at a table for 20 minutes & had ordered drinks & stuff. Why can't we have the specials too?? Who is the genius who thought it was ok to give some patrons special prices on things & forcing others to pay full price? 

Our waitress was half asleep & would disappear for long stretches. She seemed bored and/or annoyed with us. We waited forever for our first round of drinks.

My mushroom flatbread pizza was disgusting. COLD & awful. The cheese wasn't melted, the arugala wasn't the least bit stuck to the rest of the flatbread & the onions weren't caramelized. I paid like $12 for food I didn't even eat. My friends' food looked god awful too & they did some mini desserts - both the sorbet & the cherry cobbler were excessively sweet & nasty.

My bill was $20 for ONE beer & one awful, cold, nasty \"flatbread\". 

After last night, I told my friends, no matter what, I am NOT coming back to this dump. EVER."}
{"text":"First and last visit. The menu was hard to read. Ordered fish n chips. It was mostly breading. Reordered pork chops with mashed potatoes n green beans. They comped my first selection n took off $10 on the second which I had to take with me because we were late for a concert. On the up side, The decor was nice n the place was clean. Also the pork chops smell good."}
{"text":"Try the shrimp crab Pasta! The best thing on the menu. Nice amount of shrimp and loaded with crab meat."}
{"text":"I didn't get what the concept of this place was supposed to be. Is it a country western bar, a rock and roll bar or a bar-be-que and steakhouse? One wall says saddle up, while the other says rock n roll. the place has a western design with deer antlers and guitars painted on the wall. but they kept playing love songs for music. the food was ok, nothing real special. i had the pulled pork sandwich, which had a lot of grease dripping from it, and it didn't even taste as if it had been smoked. the sauce was bland and the coleslaw tasted as if had come from kfc."}
{"text":"Worst customer service....bartender is extremely rude. I won't come back. My drink sucks too!"}
{"text":"Been here 2 times.  Had I reviewed after my first visit, I would've given the place 4 stars.  The server was nice and attentive and the food and drinks were delicious.  Had I reviewed after my second visit, I would've given the place 2 stars.  The server was quiet and not as attentive and the food was cold and bland.  Since I'm just now getting around to reviewing, I guess I'll give it 3 stars.  Really a bummer when you enjoy a place once only to go back and have a no-so-great experience."}
{"text":"Wow this place has horrible food and below average service. The appetizer came out the same time as the main course. We order the pretzels which were well below average. My wife ordered an mixed drink which was so bad she had to send it back. She ordered a flat bread pizza which resembled cardboard and ketchup. My burger bun was so soggy I am guessing they dipped it in one of the 3 rivers before they brought it out. The only up side was that the beer was cold. Can't recommend this place for anything more than a place to grab a couple of beers before hitting the movie theaters next door."}
{"text":"Too dark and too loud, but my husband found multiple things on the menu he'd like to try, which pretty much never happens.  He wound up having a Philly steak sandwich, and he loved it.  The onion fries were also very good. I had pasta (California Pasta maybe?) which was to die for (although it could have used a little more feta).  Price was okay, and the service was fine, even for what seemed to be a busy Saturday night. 

One of the biggest drawbacks - parking at Tempe Marketplace is abysmal. I really highly doubt it meets ADA requirements. In the vicinity of this place, there are hundreds of parking spaces, and 2? handicapped spots? Fail. (That's how the whole place is, not just this area.)  It's wheelchair accessible, but only if you can find a proper parking space. For those less mobile, but without a wheelchair, good luck. You'll be walking quite a ways."}
{"text":"Cadillac Ranch feels like someone decided to cross a TGI Friday's with a typical nightclub, then throw a thin Southwestern-style decor over everything. The ambiance comes off feeling really shallow, and the wait staff seems about on par for what you'd expect in a venue of this nature - attentive if the place isn't busy, but if you're here on a Friday after work... expect to wait. 

They used to have a mechanical bull which was fun to watch drunk people try to ride, but it's gone (heard it needed some work in addition to liability issues).

The clientele here is definitely a bit older. As a 20-something young professional, I found myself getting chatted up by what I'd call \"cougars\" at least once per visit during happy hour. 

The bar isn't anything special selection-wise, either. Not to mention that they charged me $2 to put a drink on the rocks. The next time, I just asked for a glass of ice along with my drink neat, and it didn't cost me a dime. The bartender agreed this was weird, but that's how it works.

There's a number of options in the Settler's Ridge complex which I'd suggest before CR."}
{"text":"Went to this place with my wife and a few friends the morning after an epic wedding. I was starving. It was pretty early, about 1030. We got seated, and ordered drinks (hair of the dog, to be sure). We ordered nachos to start. They took forever to come out. 

Also, they weren't nachos. This place's idea of nachos is 6 crappy tortilla rounds with a little melted cheese and a few scraps of chicken on top. Please. If we order nachos for 4 people, we want a steaming, heaping, cheese-oozing plate of tortilla chips with pico, guac, beans, and meat. These were not nachos. They were not particularly good. And they weren't cheap.

For my early lunch/late breakfast, I ordered the beef dip; my wife got the 3 taco combination, 2 fish and 1 chicken. And then

We waited

and waited

and waited.

It should be noted that there were, at most, 8 other diners in this huge place at the time that we were there.

When we finally got out food, they had screwed up my wife's order by giving her steak instead of chicken (not a huge deal). 

Now, I had ordered the beef deep primarily because I figured that it's pretty hard to screw up. Some soft white bread, some hot juicy beef, and au jus.

What they brought me was, I swear to god, the worst sandwich I'd ever had in my life. It wasn't hot. The bread wasn't soft. The meat looked like poor-quality lunchmeat. 

One of my number 1 pet peeves is waste: wasting food, wasting money, wasting electricity, whatever. I was starving, but I did not finish my beef dip. It was that bad.

I will certainly not be going back (you couldn't pay me, so don't bother sending a gift card) and I certainly will not be recommending it to anyone in the Phoenix/Tempe area. Maybe it's more of just a drinking place, who knows; but that doesn't excuse it from messing up relatively easy-to-do bar food and having terribly slow service with nobody in the joint."}
{"text":"Went here last night with a couple of girl friends.  We spent some time trying to come up with a place to go for food, drinks, dancing, and people watching.  The restaurants/bars/nightclubs in Scottsdale came to mind for people watching, but as we were on our way, I remembered my sister's recommendation to check out Cadillac Ranch (\"CR\").  

I took a chance that CR might provide some entertainment.  Parking was plentiful (and free) since CR is located at the huge Tempe Marketplace.  We arrived around 10pm and after walking up the flight of stairs (in 4\" heels, mind you) to the guy checking ID, we were granted quick entrance into CR. 

The inside is pretty spacious, with dark lighting.  There are two bars, one on the inside and a larger one in the patio area.  There are plenty of booths scattered throughout the area, along with some tables.  We were told we can sit anywhere as long as there isn't a \"reserved\" sign.  We snagged a booth near the small dance floor and had to wait about 15 minutes before our waitress came by to take our food and drink orders.  

Mango Tango Margaritas at $6.50 each - The bartender did not skimp on the alcohol in this frozen drink; it packed a wallop!  The first drink was so good, I had to buy a second round.   

A friend ordered a Cherry Limeade ($6.50) and said she didn't taste the alcohol, so she ordered a Mango Tango Margarita too (sure got her buzzed).  I just can't believe the price...$6.50.  That will buy me half a mixed drink in L.A.  Another friend ordered straight vodka on the rocks...$6 each.  

We ordered the Southwest Chicken Egg Rolls ($8.79) and the Cowboy Sliders ($8.79) to share.  The Southwest Chicken Egg Rolls were pretty spicy...and tasted ok.  The Cowboy Sliders looked more like four small burgers instead of the tiny sliders that I'm used to. The sliders came with a side of fries.  The meat was overcooked, so the sliders tasted mediocre to me (prefer my burgers to be done medium-rare to medium-well).  For the price, the portions are decent.  

We later hit the bar at the patio and for two vodka on the rocks and one kami-kaze.  The total?  $18!  WHAT?  That price, for three drinks, is unheard of in L.A.!  I tipped the bartender very generously.    

BTW, this is supposed to be a nightclub, as the DJ has club music blasting in your ears (almost overly loud).  Don't bring any dates here expecting to have a conversation.  

Music consisted of straight 80s, 90s, and current hip hop and top 40s...including mashups of the aforementioned genres.  I was kind of tripped out to see GoGo dancers on their tiny dance floor podiums.  Seeing cute GoGo dancers doing their thing just didn't seem cohesive with the casual atmosphere of CR.  

As far as the type of crowd...there was a mix of men and women in their 20s, 30s and 40s.  It was fun to watch people dancing...and did I mention the mechanical bull?  Always fun to watch buzzed/drunk people try to handle the mechanical bull.  

The place started to fill up around midnight...to the point where the small dance floor was completely packed.  

We left CR around 1:30am and the place was still pumping.  

All in all, we enjoyed our experience at CR and will be back here for more good times...when my friends and I don't feel like dealing with the pretentiousness of Scottsdale.  The more I venture into Scottsdale (think W Hotel), the more I feel like I never left L.A. (ugh).

On another note, the new Airia Nightclub just opened inside the Gila River Bend Casino.  Although I don't gamble, we'll be checking out the new nightclub and lounges there soon enough (to see if the renovated casino lives up to the hype)."}
{"text":"Cadillac Ranch is as good as it gets! The atmosphere, staff, food and most definitely the owner make this a top choice for events, celebrations, dinner and Happy Hour. We hosted a Christmas in July event last night and Chris went out of his way to provide delicious food and a prime space to mingle and collect donations. We raised  received enough cash and food donations to provide over 1000 meals for the hungry.  An employee even helped us haul out the large box of food donations when the event was over. I highly recommend Cadillac Ranch for your next large group or event; or just to hang out and enjoy the delicious food and drinks."}
{"text":"This was my third time here its OK at best. Had the half rack of ribs BBQ sauce was good(have had better) the ribs were very dry and very tough not like ribs should be. My wife had the same hers were better her side of steemed broccoli was just drenched in butter made for a over powering taste, service was also bad I was without a drink for 10 minutes before it got refilled. Can only give cute girls so much room for error.  All in all I doubt we will be back again"}
{"text":"Went there after a movie. Don't go if you want a quiet drink. The live music was so loud it was unbearable. Didn't stay five minutes. Will maybe go back if they turn the amplifiers down a bit."}
{"text":"Service was excellent. Great place to watch a football game.  Never rushed out and server always came by seeing if we wanted refills on our waters and soda. Only complaint is the orientation of the tvs.  It can be difficult to watch 2 games at the same time depending on where you are sitting. The staff however was more than happy to change channels if there was a particular game you wanted to watch, granted this was for the smaller tvs (still about 42\" though so they weren't that small). Can't mention the big projector tv because we didn't ask to change that channel, it was on the game we wanted to see.  My main issue with this place was the food.  I ordered the \"cowboy sliders\" and it was a lackluster dish to say the least.  First off they are cooked about as well as you can cook ground beef and it still be edible, a few seconds longer on the \"grill\" and they'd completely crumble when bitten in to.  Secondly the sliders were far too small.   I'm aware that sliders are mini burgers but this was ridiculous.  The size of the bun would lead one to believe these sliders were of appropriate size, atleast big enough such that size was not noteworthy.  The problem with the sliders is that they were mostly bun.  Imagine putting a chicken mcnugget from mcdonalds on a 2.5\" bun, I am dead serious this is how they were. I wish I had taken a picture as the appearance was pure comedy until I realized I was paying for these.  Want lettuce or tomato on that slider? They'll clip you for an extra $0.79 for each!  Nickel and dimed for sure. To sum it up going to drink for a football game and Cadillac ranch is a good play, looking for a good place to eat I would look elsewhere."}
{"text":"It's pretty simple and unfortunate. Food getting worse every time we go. Service is below average. The staff seems to have an over inflated sense of importance. Bad vibes all around. Too bad too cause location is legit.."}
{"text":"Where do I began. Ordered pasta Alfredo with extra chicken(never got the extra chicken) wtf. Worse off my dinner was served cold. I ordered pasta not revenge. Very heavy on the garlic. Not vampire friendly. The biggest steak they have is 8oz. 4 or 5 of those my fill you up. It's not really a family restaurant. Just a glorified sports hang out. Less sports hotter food would be great."}
{"text":"Wish i had looked at this before i bought the groupon and went.  Did not even read this before we went so i was not biased.  We were seated pretty quick but took forever to get our order taken.  The appetizer was ok (fried ravioli)  I had the steak sliders.... think of a tiny piece of steak 1\" x 1/2\" x 11/2\" on a pretty huge roll. There was no steak hardly.  Way way pricy for what you get.  Could have gotten more meat at Mcd's"}
{"text":"This place does not disappoint, despite the  constant craze of high volume customer flow. They seem to care about each and every customer and their food. 
I cannot express enough, how impressed I am with their food, the quality and presentation. Some of my favorites: candied pork chops, no bull burger, black and blue salmon salad and their flat bread variations. 

Also, props to the bartenders who actually care about how much you've had to drink. The willingness to call a cab, offer food or anything else that displays concern was highly impressive. 

Another incident that deserves praise, was when I ordered the salmon salad as take out. When I arrived to pick it up, the hostesses assured me that it was being prepped and should be out soon. I proceeded to pay for it in advance and waited in the lobby/receiving area. I observed the hostesses as they alternately checked on my order. They were extremely polite and apologetic for the long wait. After 20 minutes one of them came up to me and truthfully shared that the cooks had just started cooking the salmon. She seemed scared, but kept her professional composure. I finally decided to let her know, that it was ok and that I was in no rush. I also shared that I'd rather have the cooks take the time to prep the food correctly, instead of \"half ass-ing\" it.  
After a total of an hour wait, I received my to-go salad with a receipt that stated that the food was on the house. What a wonderful and unexpected surprise! Most restaurants still try to get your money in this situation. 
Bravo to Cadillac ranch and on the superior training of their staff. 
Thank you for showing you care!"}
{"text":"As you can see I am catching up on my yelping tonight...

All i can say about cadillac ranch in tempe is that I had the worst experience here ever. The service was horrible, and so was the manager. 

My friends and I went there around 8:15 p.m. We just wanted to get a few appetizers and a few drinks.  We had this young brunette waitress. We asked her what time they stopped serving food. (I don't like to order right before to closing). She said she thinks they stopped serving at 9:30 p.m. but the bar at 1 a.m. We asked for waters to start while look over the menu. 15 minutes later, we get our waters. We tell her we're ready to order so the 5 for us order a beer each. She tells us she'll be back in a min to get our food order.  30 min pass and we still don't get our drinks. We try to flag our server down and she just  tells us to wait a second. We finally get our  drinks at 9:15.  (we were being as patient as possible, because we've all worked in the service industry before.) We tell her we are ready to order food now. She tells us that they stopped serving food already!!! By that time I was pretty pissed. I ask to talk to the manager, and she asks WHY? haha.. So by then I didn't even want to deal with a  little girl who absolutely had no clue what she was doing. 

The manager approached the table. I told him exactly what had happened.  He advises us that they serve food until 1030 p.m.  He apologizes about his server and says it wasn't her fault because she was busy, and she is new.  By this time it was already passed 10 p.m. 

She brings the check by and says to us, \"by the way, it only took me 10 minutes to get my drinks, not 45min. But I'm sorry.\" WOW... decide for yourselves everyone!

Hopefully that waitress found a new career, and that manager(heavy set, man, with curly red hair) found another career as well. How hard is it to get decent service these days?"}
{"text":"Visit: 5/14/09 - Dinner.  Ate Roasted Chicken, Ranch Chips, Hot Wings, Calamari, shrimp & crab penne, and pork chops.

Roasted Chicken was okay.  They need to give more BBQ sauce with the chicken.  Chicken was dry without sauce.

Ranch chips are tasty.  Too expensive for chips though.

Shrimp & Crab Penne was pretty good.

Pork Chops were tasty, but dry.  The portion was extra large.  Overall I would not choose the pork chops.  Anything dry is terrible.

Hot Wings were good.  Nothing special.

Calamari was good, but the portion was small.

Don't order coffee.  They serve it cold and it taste instant.

Service was below average.  Only thing going for the waitress was that she was wearing corset so you can see cleavage.  Other than that, she was bad.

Notable is the bull riding.  They have a mechanical bull ride that is free.  That is very entertaining to watch.  They need more girls to ride that bull.  Too many guys.

I would come back for happy hour.  Cheaper and good atmosphere."}
{"text":"Ok, I'm mixed on this place here. And surprisingly it's because of the HOSTESSES and the chicken egg rolls. I brought my toddler here to introduce him to an old friend (old as in \"been friends a long time\" not as in \"she's over the hill\").

I generally am VERY unimpressed by the young hostesses manning the lists/seat assigning at restaurants.  However, one lady in particular was great. I'll save the boring details having to do with getting a table with a toddler, but she was great. They noticed how restless my son was getting waiting for a table and was great in getting us in.  She also entertained my son at dinner which any of you with young children know, dining out is a gamble!  

The waiter, not so great and that's part of the reason for only 2 stars. We ordered the southwest chicken egg rolls for an appetizer and I got the sliders with cheese thinking my son would like them. I was thoroughly unimpressed with the sliders, the fries were ok, although I could make better ones at home in my oven (main reason for 2 stars). However, the egg rolls were DELICIOUS. If i came back here again I would get those and a salad as my meal and pray to the heavens the salad was better than the sliders.

Here's why I'll come back:  halfway place to meet my friend, great egg rolls (wow could i mention those things any more in my post?), but above all, KID FRIENDLY and great service by the hostess. I definitely wouldn't come back for the sliders - blegh."}
{"text":"I've been to Cadillac Ranch a couple of times now. The actual restaurant and bar is very nice. It's spacious and has some nice spots to hang out with with a group. They also have a mechanical bull!!

However, the drinks I've had were not good. They just didn't taste good. The food was also lackluster. 

I've never had a problem getting in or trouble at the door. I just think for the drinks and food prices, I'd rather go over to the Blue Martini literally next door during 4-8pm and pay less for better drinks."}
{"text":"Used to be a fun bar, not anymore. The food is ok. I won't be back anytime soon!"}
{"text":"I've been here several times before.  Tonight I went and took a seat at the bar.  I got my drink relatively quickly (slow by my standards).  I was not asked if I wanted a menu   It was dinner time.   I waited mores than 20 minutes  another gentleman sat down next to me. He had been waiting 10
Minutes and was not even acknowledged.   Please note there were 4 bartenders and the place was not busy.    I finally waved
The  bartender down.  The gentleman sitting next to me and I adVised her that we had been waiting an unnecessarily long time. She took our order with almost no apology for the service.  

after completing my meal she Asked if I wanted another drink to which I replied not yet.  Within minutes she asked of I wanted to cash out to which I replied not yet.  A few minute later she came back she came back and asked again. At this point i said sure
She brought me the bill
And I inquired why she was in a hurry to have me leave.  Basically I guess I wasn't ordering drinks fast enough for her.

The gentleman sitting next to me stated that he had never seen this ever happen. 

To make matters worse, if they could be, I spoke to the manager on the way out. He was almost dismissive of my complaint.  I wasn't looking for any compensation just acknowledgement."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I decided to stop into Cadillac Ranch after a movie on Sunday 6/2/13 at about 6:30 pm. I've passed by Cadillac Ranch probably a hundred times, but I had never given it a shot until today. I usually pass by Cadillac Ranch because it's surrounded by a dozen other bars and restaurants that always appear to be busier and more inviting. Today I learned why the place seems so dead - they have pretty bad service. When we walked in we were half greeted by a hostess who told us the bar was open seating. Upon entering the main dining area we quickly noticed the place was at about 10% capacity, on a Sunday, during dinner time - not a good sign. There appeared to be at least 1 employee for every customer in the restaurant. This isn't always a bad thing, as this usually means you will get a lot of attention and service. As we sat down at the bar we saw a bar back stacking glasses and doing some cleaning. The bar back made eye contact with us and continued to clean. After about two minutes the bar back began talking to some of the other guests around the bar, and when he finished talking he walked over to where we were sitting to put down some glasses. After the bar back stood near us for another minute or two without acknowledging us in any way I decided to ask \"Excuse me, Sir. Is there a bar tender working right now?\" The bar back told me that there was indeed a bartender \"somewhere\" but he didn't know where. The bar back then walked outside to the back patio where I assumed he was going to find the bar tender....... not a big deal at all, mistakes happen. However, I was wrong. The bar back did go outside, but it appeared he just went out there to clean more things and do some more chit-chatting. We waited at the bar for a total of about 10-13 minutes without a single person acknowledging us (Yes, this was a REAL 10-13 minutes, because I checked my phone after what felt like 2 or 3 minutes, and then again when we got up.) On our way out we passed by the hostess stand again where there were 3 employees standing around talking (1 behind the stand, 1 on the side, 1 in front). When the hostess broke away for a moment to say \"Thanks for coming in!\" I said to her \"I don't think your bar tender is around anymore because we just sat there for 10 minutes without being greeted\". At this point I expected a reply of \"Oh no, wait, let me get someone right now!\" or a \"Hold on, don't go, let me grab my manager.\" However, all we got was a \"Ohhh, uhhh, sorry.\" At that point we just decided to take our business elsewhere. I would also like to note that my girlfriend and I are also both in the Bar/Restaurant industry, and have been for 10+ years. We're both extremely forgiving when it comes to service errors and mistakes. With that being said, the one thing I can't forgive is simple laziness and indifference.

Also, some people may wonder why I gave Cadillac Ranch only 1 star after only being in the establishment for 15 minutes. I simply have nothing else to judge Cadillac Ranch on. I would have given them a higher score if they had good food and drinks to make up for the service; but we were unable to even get that far."}
{"text":"I had a good bad experience while at Cadillac ranch. The inside decor was pretty cool and had comfortable booths, which I appreciate. We ordered three different appetizers that were  on happy hour before our entrees. The Wontons, the queso dip, and the Chicken tenders. The tenders were good. They were beer battered and  tender. The queso dip was pretty bland and the chips awful. They weren't stale but just obviously super low quality. The Wontons were obviously frozen and sitting on a bed of syrup. It was like having desert and appetizers at the same time. When it came time to order entrees i was the last to do so. I asked my server about an option between three entrees and she danced around all of them suggesting that I have a pulled pork sandwich that was clearly less expensive than the ribs, steak or taco plate I inquired about. I should have headed her advice. It isn't every day a server tries to under sale you I ordered the ribs and was disappointed. the texture was off the flavor was bland except for the sauce which was spicy and not good enough to mask the bad flavor. My server Liz was awesome. She was attentive and friendly. She noticed I hadn't eaten my entree and took it away. The manager came back and was apologetic he offered me another entree and I took Liz's advice and got the pulled pork sandwich. It was much better. The staff was good and did there job very well. It isn't their fault the food quality is so bad."}
{"text":"Seriously?  Only 2 stars?  You guys either haven't been out in AZ or are just idiots.  This place has good HH deals and decent food.  Best 'bar' in TMP btw.  Wait staff is always sweet and accommodating."}
{"text":"Bad service, bad food and I wont be coming back. The manager or owner needs to go to business school and read a few books on customer service!  We sat at the bar and that was are first mistake, after literally standing and waving are arms in the air with five guys behind the bar and about six customers around the bar. When we did get service, we  ordered food  and had to ask for silverware and condiments. I had the pork chop w/ mac and cheese and it was terrible. The couple by us, left because of the bad service. 
       I grew up with family in the restaurant business and all I can say to the owner(s) is -GET OUT OF THE FOOD AND HOSPITALITY BUSINESS!-AMY"}
{"text":"I received a message from Bill the new general manager shortly after my review to get in touch with him so I called him back. He was very nice and extended out a sincere apology for the experience I had and wanted to know all that happened and offered to make it up to me if I come back and give them another chance. Like I said in my review, we enjoyed ourselves dancing so it was just the service that was bad so I told him I'll get back to him after I talk to my friends for our next girls night out outing as we were planning on another in a month for 2 of the girls birthdays coming up anyways. 

Well, we decided to go ahead and go to Cadillac Ranch again and Bill said he'll make sure everything goes smoothly for us and he'll treat us to champagne and appetizers on him and get us a table for the group. 

There were about 11 of us that showed up for dinner and about another 12+ who later showed up for dancing. Bill not only made sure that we had Liz our waitress who was sweet, excellent and tentative in making sure we had drinks, waters, etc throughout the whole night but he also had a security watching our tables so we were well taken care of as promised.  We definitely had the VIP red carpet treatment. You won us over and we will be returning for more girls night out in the future. Thanks again for a pleasant experience and doing all you can to making this 2nd visit an enjoyable one. My girlfriends & I all agree, you went above and beyond expectations and we were very impressed and thank you for a great fun night."}
{"text":"So so at best, service is good, prices are high considering what you get. The patio is nice when weather allows. Menu is on the lower side of average. It's good for drinks but if you're looking for a meal I'd explore other options. I gave it 3 stars based on the atmosphere and service, the only saving grace."}
{"text":"Went here for dinner with some friends. I would totally recommend getting the wings in BBQ sauce. They were delicious! We then shared the pierogie pizza, mushroom pizza, and spinach dip. Definitely enough food for 3. The pizza's are a pretty good size. The spinach dip looked different but didn't taste bad."}
{"text":"hmmm...where do I begin with Cadillac Ranch. I first went there to meet a friend for lunch. He knew the owner and we went to support his friends business. I'm all for trying new places and I thought this might be pretty good. 
As you walk in the atmosphere is pretty cool. Dark wood and knick knacks hung from the walls. Kinda reminded me of an adult TGIF. We sat down and must of waited 10 minutes till a server carved out some time in her schedule to greet us. We gave her our order. She came back pretty quick with drinks but the 2 salads we ordered took 20 minutes! when I looked at my salad I saw cheese was covering my salad! I asked told the waitress that I asked for no cheese and her kind response was \"What do you want me to do about it?\". Uh, I don't know...fix it?! I think I'm on a new theory of the cuter the server the crappier the service. 

OK so I went again after vowing never to come back. My co worker and I were looking for a place to enjoy margaritas and nachos. Well, we still waited a 10 minutes till we were greeted but food came out much faster and the service was friendlier. 

So why do you ask if i had better service yet I still gave it 2 stars? In a totally empty restaurant I still had to wait 10 minutes for service, the nachos were good but so small for the price. This place is far from being the restaurant I want to come back to."}
{"text":"Ran out of sirloin. Overcooked the NY strip. The burger had enough grease to lube my car. Served me wrong beer. TERRIBLE FOOD."}
{"text":"I decided to catch a movie down at Tempe Marketplace the other day with a friend (Horrible Bosses, AWESOME) and decided to head upstairs to Cadillac for some pre- movie happy hour. Being that I sit at bars except for family dinners we ponied up. I saw that they had a couple of 4 Peaks beers on draft so I chose to go the peach ale route while my buddy grabbed a frozen margarita. Both were super refreshing, enough so that I eventually had 2 more! Got down on the preztels appetizer, which when dipped in the fondue tasted like little angels dancing on my tongue before I ate them! My buddy ordered the bacon wontons, which I had to steal one, and they were one of the best things with bacon I have ever tried (right up there with Citizen's bacon popcorn and Beckett's Tables' bacon smores!) So flavorful it made me want 20 of them! I was also really stoked to see Blackmaker on the back bar. For those of you who don't know, try it. It's like Jager without the anise flavor or harshness. 
Now for the part that pushed me to write this: I noticed quite a few people comment on the service being bad, but I thought the bartenders did a great job staying on top of us. There was a male by the name of Justin who was very helpful in recommendations, and he was with a girl (Deanna?) Who was extremely personable and outgoing. They made sure my beers were always filled and our food was great! I will for sure make this my movie theater pre-game locale!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere was great, the food was also great. The service was not so good. Pricey, but that's ok. Just thought the service could have been better, they weren't very busy and almost had to beg to be waited on. I'll give it one more try though."}
{"text":"If good food, excellent service, and bartenders that mix drinks strong enough to knock a bull elephant to it's knees aren't enough for you then perhaps all these and the lure of a mechanical bull will do the trick. 

First and foremost, the food was good. The selection will definitely appeal to the man's man with a variety of bar appetizers and entrees including beef, pulled pork sandwiches, burgers, chicken, and some fish. The Bacon wrapped shrimp appetizer was decent (the cornbread was a tad dry), I found the Tempe Burger to be a tasty treat, make sure they bring your BBQ sauce on the side as most chains will slather it on obliterating the taste of the burger and my dinner companion had no complaints about the Phoenix Cheesesteak. The beer selection was average with respectable variety of domestic and imported brands and the bar did not skimp in the slightest on booze. The service was friendly and prompt, very responsive but not intrusive. The deco is the outcome of a Rock N' Roll tornado colliding with the Beverly Hill Billies (Rock-A-Billy) the Ranch also has a great deck which overlooks a busy pedestrian crosswalk near Dave and Busters (a potential spot for a bit of after dinner fun).

If all of this isn't enough and you just want MORE then nothing can top off a night of drinking or excite a designated driver like the prospect of a passenger that had a heavy night of drinking and finished it off with the ever so gentle swaying of a mechanical bull. Oh yes, just imagine the possibilities!"}
{"text":"Decent. Patio is great. Spacious and a nice hangout spot. The boneless wings were $5 and Cadillac style was like a honey sirrachah. The pecan crusted pork was a huge amount of food. The sweet potato tots lacked a little in terms of flavor and made for an interesting pairing with the pecan crusting...kind of like sweet potatoes pie you'd have for thanksgiving...maybe too rich of a sweet dish for dinner. Fiancé had the sirloin steak...cooked how he ordered it...nice peppery flavor, broccoli was cooked well...mashed potatoes were ok. Would go again!"}
{"text":"We had purchased a Groupon for Cadillac Ranch and were a bit  unnerved reading the reviews.  We went with an open mind and low expectations as well.

We took the kids and from the start they were excited seeing the upstairs open patio and the full size red Cadillac above the stairs.  We took our time and looked at the license plates covering the entry ceiling. It was fun looking for certain states!

We were greeted by two \"put-out\" hosts and a very friendly hostess.  We asked to sit on the patio and she took us right out.  The menus needed some cleaning but not filthly.

Our server greeted us and got our drink order and appetizer (chips, salsa & queso).  The menu items are a bit pricey, but the view and warm sun on our faces was great.  Our kids' drinks arrived first, then our bar drinks.  Water wasn't brought to us, we had to ask for it.

Our daughter was thrilled that they had ribs so she ordered the half rack , our son had the pretzel with cheese & french fries and the wife and I shared the taco plate.

Our server was a bit slow, but she was getting hit on by a table of 50 year old men right next to us.  She did a great job with our kids keeping their sodas filled. so considering the cause of the slowness we were okay.  The food was good, price a bit much (definitely paying for the Cadillac above the stairs, all the license plates and the mechanical bull).

Overall we had a good time, don't know if we'll be back based on pricing and distance from our home. Definitely not without a Groupon to ease the check."}
{"text":"I used to come here often. However, today will mark my last visit. The food is good, don't get me wrong. But the service is horrible. 

The service has always been slow, but today reached a new level of slowness. We were there around 12:30pm, so it wasn't like it was busy. My party of 4 sat there for at least 5 minutes maybe 10 minutes before we were greeted. Our appetizer came out just fine. Then after we finished our appetizer our server took the plates and everything away and said that she was gonna check on our food. 

We then sat there for another 20 minutes and she came back to check on us and said she would check on our food again. Another 10-15 minutes goes by and we asked how much longer until our food would be ready and she said that they were waiting on one more item. 

Another 10-15 minutes goes by and the food finally comes out. I'm sorry but a three item order should come out faster than 40 minutes after an appetizer. The manager come by after he brought us our food and asked how it was, we said it \"was good now that we finally have it\". He gave us some story that one of the items came out cold so they remade it. Okay remake or not, it STILL SHOULDN'T TAKE OVER 40 MINUTES! AND if there was an issue with our order they should have told us sooner than after we sat there forever.

Anyway you look at it, today was the last straw and we will never be back again."}
{"text":"My first visit to Cadillac Ranch Las Vegas location was very disturbing. It revealed a culture of disrespect highlighted by inappropriate and unprofessional behavior. This culture of disrespect seemed to be fully reinforced by management who did not care to listen or address our immediate complaints.  Certainly such behaviors have a negative effect on Cadillac Ranch's profits and reputation, so I thought it worthwhile to address corporate management.

Evidently, our bartender, Rachel (Bar3-t8), was not happy with the 10% tip we provided.  We were $1.50 short of 20% but we were not happy with her poor service.  She was belligerent loudly calling us \"Cheap ass mofos\",  instructing security to \"get them out of here, they don't deserve to finish their drinks\", and proclaiming, \"this is my bar, don't come back.\"  We sat their dumb founded that she would treat customers with such disrespect. We quietly left the bar area to seek the manager.

Our group of four never imagined or has ever experienced such disrespect. After spending $25 as entrance fee, $25 for hookah, and $29.23 at the bar,  a total of $79.23, we wanted to let the manager know we felt we paid too much for  the insults. However, to make matters worse, we were informed by an assistant manager, that the manager \"was busy counting money\" so we were to take his business card instead. Evidently, while he had time to count our $79.23, he did not have enough time to tend to our concerns.

As we make our complaints to Yelp, the BBB and the corporate office of Cadillac Ranch we are left wondering what sort of abuse we might have experienced if we left no tip. Are tips required even for unsatisfactory service? 

It also begs the question, \"Is this behavior condoned by corporate management?\"  Or, \"Will we get some meaningful action from corporate?\" I know from running my own business and having worked at a Fortune 500 company that substantive changes do not happen overnight, nor did the degradation of customer service at Cadillac Ranch. Typically a signal needs to be sent throughout the organization so that even long after this incident, a line item exists showing a problem occurred and other line items are created to initiate a long-term solution. I suggest a refund of our $79.23 is the needed signal that will also give us reason to try your establishment again."}
{"text":"I have been here a few times, most recently today- I have a friend who loves to go here. This place is not bad by any means, it is the ultimate epitome of average, nondescript, personality-less and blah. 

The food is not bad, I had the BBQ chicken salad today, my buddy got the sliders, and I have had the wraps in the past- all actually pretty good. Their prices are about average (go figure) and the food is quick enough for a work lunch. 

I just cannot get over how blah the whole damn experience is. The servers ALL seem totally uninspired, there is NO atmosphere, and the entire experience is forgotten the second you walk out the door. 

Do yourself a favor and unless you have a friend who loves this place- PASS!"}
{"text":"A fun place to get a drink and some good food. Try out the mini-fish tacos here amf enjoy the patio for some live music."}
{"text":"Its kind of a wanna-be-chain restaurant that evolves into a nightclub on the weekends. I would probably never eat there, so I cant comment on the food. You will see some good looking women - mostly kiddos, and its a pretty big spot with three different bars and lots of room to bounce around. I wouldn't stay too late though. Its basically just a gangster-party/Mexican sausage-fest after about midnight. Very STRONG drink pours though... at least from the patio bar if you tip well. And be sure to watch your step down the stairs on your way out.... we watched this girl trip over her heals and damn near crack her head open about half-way down. We didnt know whether to laugh or help. But she seemed OK, bounced right up, and rolled over to San Felipes across the street - where they let her right in. Gotta love the Marketplace!"}
{"text":"Disgusting. The floors are so sticky, my shoe stuck and I stepped out of it. The serving staff smokes on premises in their break area, and the smell of cigarette smoke permeates very strongly into the dining room. We ate food there, against my better judgment. My burger was decent, but the fries were lukewarm. The bathroom is all black, including the toilets, which usually means they don't clean the place very well. Put it this way, I cleaned off the bottom of my shoes when I got home to remove the sticky whatever-it-was. This place is gross. I don't intend to come back here."}
{"text":"Went here for happy hour. We had three appetizers, and four drinks, and the tab was 30$. Not bad. The bacon won tons are outta this world, i will definitly be back just for those. I would definitly only consider this place for happy hour, as regular prices are on the high side. The service was good,nice seevers. All in all,it was a good experience"}
{"text":"Good Happy Hour Spot.. Nice price on drinks and appetizers. The only thing that sucks was they are not consistent on the food sometimes it good sometimes not some much.. But still a good Happy Hour Spot"}
{"text":"As odd as it may sound, I was really happy with Cadillac Ranch as a family restaurant.  Oh, yes, there were the usual choices on the kids menu, but my daughter actually picked the grilled chicken breast, which was a welcome alternative to the usual. I always get the Kettle Chips as an appetizer, and they are really good!  Chips covered in bleu cheese and balsamic vinegar-yumm!  This time I tried the crab cake, and had I not eaten the chips first, I would have licked the plate clean. It was a nice crab cake with lots of crab meat and not too much filler. This was my second visit, and I'll be back!"}
{"text":"While the atmosphere is good the food is about the worst that I have had and the service wasn't exceptional. Both meals were nothing but fat and when we complained our waitress agreed with us but made no offer to exchange for something else or to take them off the bill (and this isn't a cheap place). Our waitress did pass my comments on to the manager who was sitting across from us but he just shrugged his shoulders. Not to be recommended."}
{"text":"Yeah, i'm gonna go ahead and down-grade my rating from my previous review. The lack of awareness and attention you get as a customer is very inadequate. I have ordered take out and dined in since my last review and just wasn't pleased at all. 1. with the quality of the food and 2. with their customer service.

Another long wait until our server showed up. I wanted to leave but my I didn't want to be like that. It is just ridiculous to me that it would take soooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo long for anyone to address you once seated. 

I won't miss this place too much aside from the Bacon Won Tons. oh, well."}
{"text":"I went here for lunch today. The atmosphere is great, but that's it. There were 2 host's that barely greeted us. We decided to sit at the bar. The restaurant was dead, it was Monday, and the bartender took a while to greet us. He had no personality and did not provide a good service. The food was edible but not good. The nachos should be left to a Mexican restaurant and the cowboy bites were not good. No manager visible anywhere. Not a good sign."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I were in need of a Bloody Mary, so we stopped here to get one and a bite to eat.  Nothing on their menu was stood out, just regular old burgers and salads. We opted for the grilled chicked flatbread, which was actually good.  We had ordered two Spicy Bloody Mary's - when they came out, there WERE NO VEGGIES IN IT.  Not even an effin green olive.  Are you kidding me?  We like our food and drinks spicy, but this had half the bottle of Tabasco sauce in it.  The waiter was less than average and the busser checked on us more than the actual waiter did.  Never going back, what a joke."}
{"text":"So, I wrote a review on this place a while back about how this place was unfriendly to tattooed people and wouldn't even let me get close to the front door and was pleased to see that I got a little apology from the owner. But when I read the actual comment she left, it was this 
\"Thank you for taking the time to write this review. I apologize your level of service expectations were not met. It's our mission to please every customer with wonderful food, outstanding service, awesome entertainment and speedy service.
Sincerely,
Jessica (Marketing/ Event Coordinator) Cadillac Ranch Tempe\"

First of all Jessica, I didn't actually experience any service at your establishment, or even had a chance to have my expectations met or not. My experience wasn't the kind that you can go, \"Sorry for the service\"  And Thank you so much for cutting and pasting this generic apology on every bad review Cadillac ranch gets. (Didn't think we would notice that?) By you doing that, It honestly just showed me that you truly didn't care about making it right at all by actually reading what happened in my experience there and apologizing for it. Instead you picked all the reviews with one star and stuck the same apology over and over hoping that would be enough to appease the public. I would say I have never been so insulted in my life but if you actually take the two minutes out of your busy day to actually read my review this time. you will obviously see otherwise. Thank you \"Jessica\" and Cadillac ranch staff for once again showing your true colors when it comes to customer service by doing the bare minimum. 
Next time actually read the review. 
  -Thank you-"}
{"text":"Very unhappy with this establishment. Tonight was my second visit and I will not be giving them another chance. Upon arriving one of the waitresses was careless and spilt someones ice water down my side. I must say this put me in a bad mood for the remainder of the evening. To top it all off she did not apologize just handed me some napkins and asked \"are you ok?\" UHHHH GOOD CONSIDERING THE ICE WATER DOWN MY SIDE!!!! My husband and I were there for a going away party. We brought in an 8 top of guests. The service was poor. It took on average 10 minutes for each request. When the manager finally came to apologize for his clumsy staff, he advised me that my drinks were comped. I then proceeded to tell him that ironically I was D.D. and would be drinking water. The food is over priced but the drinks are strong. Good luck!"}
{"text":"We visited Cadillac Ranch with a party of 15. We called ahead to make a reservation,  upon arrival the hostess advised us because we were such a large party to sit beside or close to anyone that you were going to be sharing a bill with.  Half of our party was seated,  we were approached by our servers to take drink orders.  While they were away,  more people arrived and we had to adjust seating.  When our servers returned,  we were snapped at and asked if we had chosen our final seats.  Rude.  We were treated with absolutely nothing but attitude by one of the servers the entire time.  Maybe she didn't get the memo that big parties = big tips. The majority of our food arrived on time but one of the meals did not arrive until nearly everyone was finished.  Not even an apology. The food is not worth the cost.  Period.  We work relatively close for a large Pittsburgh company and although convenient,  we will be sure to steer clear of Cadillac Ranch for any future outtings."}
{"text":"So I was debating on writing a review or not to this place because it use to be my favorite place to hang out every Thursday night for over a year with my boyfriend. We had great service from Matt, Darrin, Buddy, Justin, Ray and all the other guys who USE TO work there. They went above and beyond to make sure they served everyone and the drinks and food were great. Things started changing mainly with the staff and the changes were not good. All those guys we would return to see, were no longer there. The feel of the place was not the same and also the service with the new people was horrible. I have not returned to this place in about 3 months because it just was not the same. Not just the service, but the food. There are changes and I do not like the new \"Nachos\" those are not nachos! Anyways, I read some of these reviews down there and it seems that the place is not improving and it makes me feel like that I have no business going back. I just hope that the owners realize that their changes has affected business and it is really upsetting."}
{"text":"This place is nothing like it was! If you want ghetto music and atmosphere this is your place. I'm in complete awe how downhill this place has become.  Very disappointed!"}
{"text":"The initial goal was to meet up with a family member that was in town who FLAKED on me.  Looking at the menu before I left I decided to go anyway since the prices weren't too pricey.

The huddle of hostesses were a disgrace.  The place was relatively empty as we went around 4:30-5pm on a Saturday afternoon/evening.  We received our intial \"hello\" but after that we pretty much were non-existent.  The blonde girl was applying her lip gloss with her finger when were standing at the hostess station.  Another employee came in with half-a-glass of water that the brunette hostess stowed behind the podium.  The girl with the glass was also waving her paycheck in the area and very RUDELY squeezed past me and the podium without saying excuse me.  I personally make it a point not to mouth off to the staff before I eat because I enjoy food that hasn't been spat on.

Being successfully irked by the hosting staff, I was pleasantly surprised by the genuine niceness of our server.  She let us know about the specials which weren't bad.  We got the better end of the deal because although it was Saturday the NFL playoff game was going on so our bucket of beer was $5 cheaper.  

Our plates were $7 each which we though were a good deal... until our plates arrived.  They were tiny portions although, they were filling enough for me.  I had the Southwest Taquitos (more like eggrolls...) which were ok.  The pico de gallo had a nice sour taste to it and was well balanced with onions and sprinkles of chopped jalapeno here and there.  My boyfriend got the \"Sherry Ahi Tuna\"  I don't know if that was a typo or what, but it was seared and it was served on top of fried wonton squares which were served on top of the Asian salad.  The smell of sesame oil was delightful, and to be honest... I wanted more of what he had.

The mechanical bull was pretty entertaining.  A family and all the kids took turns riding it and it was entertaining to see the chubby kid attempt to get on the bull on 3 separate attempts and ultimately had his brother help him on.... And on top of that the look of apprehension on his face was priceless.  He lasted less than a minute.

All-in-all it was an okay experience.  I will be back, hopefully for the AFC championship (Bolts vs. Colts)."}
{"text":"Excellent place for good food and a grand ole time! They have a mechanical bull that is awesome for those drunken moments :) and the main reason I'm giving this place 5 stars is because its the place I go to watch my beloved Texas Longhorns!"}
{"text":"You won me back, slowly. I went this past Saturday night and sat at the bar. Ordered the spinach dip and it was delicious! Crowd atmosphere was good and bartender was on the ball. 

Only issue was noticing one of the male employees filling the fruit holders for drinks with his hands. The problem with this was that he had just returned with ice and had done some minor cleaning before filling the fruit containers. You should always wash your hands right before handling food. 

All in all everything else seemed good."}
{"text":"Recently went to the ranch. Not a fan. Over an hour wait. Food was average which we had to wait for. Confusing place as to what exactly it's supposed to be is it a sports bar? Is it a country bar? Is it a rock and roll type place? All in all not a great place"}
{"text":"The GM Donnie hooked my boys and I up with a great spot for the UFC fight and nikki and Emily, our servers, were outstanding! I woul recommend this place to anyone that wants to be treated to great food, a great time, and fret service! Thanks CR for an outstanding experience!"}
{"text":"Nice Happy Hour! Good service and food! but I didn't really like it as a night time bar so much only because I am a little older then the night life crowd here but  I will definitely keep returning to their happy hours and restaurant hours! If you are college aged you may really enjoy the night life here."}
{"text":"Big BBQ burger was very good. Fries not that hot, but beats piping hot mouth burn. Ranch was very good!

Very reasonable prices and wine only $6 a glass.

Alex male server very attentive and guy who brought food was very upbeat and energetic.  Great service!

4 stars bc of dirty app. Plate. Hey it happens. I didn't even mention it. Just didn't use it.

Been here for drinks before on a Friday night late. More bar scene.

6 and 7 pm. On a Saturday night this time and very family friendly :)"}
{"text":"I wish I could give zero or negative stars cause this place is bad. Food was below average. Had a burger at lunch time. It comes on a brioche bun. Really??? Don't really know how you screw up a burger but they made it seem easy. Our server was non existent. It would have been a more pleasurable experience if I would have taken the order, rang it in myself, brought it to the table, and checked back on ourselves. I have worked in the service industry a long time and I must say that it is not any of the employees faults for our horrifically bad experience. It's managements fault. Inattentive and nonexistent managers are the ones to blame. Bad managers make bad employees. My friend ordered a side of guacamole with his meal and comically it didn't arrive with our food. No surprise there. When we were able to get someone to finally notice us, mind you it was a weekday and the restaurant was slammed (insert sarcasm here) it took one of us to leave the booth and walk over to where the cool kids hang out (the server side station) and they were doing absolutely nothing except standing there doing absolutely nothing. I must have motioned with my hand 10 times that we needed something and I swear 6 of the 10 times at least one of the 3 girls there saw me every time and ignored me. We finally got the guacamole. Fast forward to when the check came. Remember the side of guacamole? There were 2 sides on the check. Not that I think we should have gotten it for free, even tho we waited for it and basically had to get up from the table to get it ourselves, actually I could have probably gotten it faster then they did, but we were double charged. I asked about the double charge and the server said that the price was right. I just wanted to leave by now but my buddy insisted that we weren't going to pay for something we didn't order. So he asked for a manager. We watched the server walk over to a man sitting in front of a laptop at the corner of the bar. They talked for a few seconds, we watched him look our way. The server returned and told us the manager was busy and if we wanted we could wait a while to talk to him. Seriously??? Does both the manager and the server honestly think that we are total morons? They must, because we watched it all go down. Unless the guy at the end of the bar wasn't the manager, actually I can understand why everything was so poor if he was the manager because at 12:45 in the middle of lunch he should probably be on the floor and not on a computer at the bar, if he wasn't the manager then the server never went and got him which is super awesome. Anyway, I'm actually mad that I went out of my way to review a place that would be much much better if it would just close it's doors for ever. 
Food = below average 
Service = very poor 
Management = horrendous 

Hire capable managers and servers with experience. Not just the ones that are nice to look at."}
{"text":"Great. Food and drink prices.  A gem in the desert."}
{"text":"The hostess was a bit confrontational. We should have just left.

The iced tea was Lipton and the lemonade was Minute Maid. Blech.

I ordered the Phoenix Cheesesteak sandwich, a signature item. I was told that they were out of that and the Philly cheesesteak. I settled for Fish and Chips instead. My dining companion ordered a cheeseburger with onion rings.

While we were waiting for our food, a customer at the bar lit a cigarette. This is how we found out that the patio is a smoking area - information we could have used before we decided to sit there.

When my food arrived, there was a visible pool of grease in my plate. The fish literally oozed grease. The fries were stone cold. The plate was inedible. My companion's cheeseburger was good, but only came with five cold onion rings.

I sent the fish and chips back and asked for a steak salad instead, which I took home and haven't eaten yet. 

Our server was friendly and did her best to be helpful, but we never saw a manager.

We won't be going back to Cadillac Ranch."}
{"text":"I should have listened to the other reviewers. The food was not very good for the price. I have had better food at McDonald's. Music too loud, service was less than desirable, and food was gross."}
{"text":"I cannot believe this place is still open!!! The food is horrible. DO NOT EAT HERE. Go downstairs and eat @ YARDHOUSE."}
{"text":"Terrible service. Sat at the bar for almost 2 hours...waited 30 minutes to even have a bartender approach us. Once we got his attention he never came back unless our glass was empty. We wanted to order food and it took so long we contemplated even ordering. But we did. Lackluster and not worth the wait. They weren't even busy. Waste of time and money."}
{"text":"Terrible. Don't waste your money or time.
We were going to have dinner here, but trying to place a reservation well in advance gave a big thumbs down to our group of 14.
We ended up eating elsewhere at Tempe Marketplace and then went to the ranch.  The drinks were expensive by AZ standards and weren't right half the time, in addition to being pretty weak.  Place was pretty busy and a good amount of potential for a good night out.  Then about midnight they started throwing people out left and right.  We were celebrating a birthday and the birthday boy brushed up a against a \"security\" person and was ejected.  I've been going out a long time and have never seen anything like it.  They told the rest of group we could stay.  Ohhh, OK, you just tossed the guest of honor.  Then seeing other people being \"profiled\" and tossed out...really weird...
We won't be back, ever."}
{"text":"Honestly..I think this is just a cool place to hang out for a drink and a bite to eat on a Thursday night.  Certainly wouldn't spend my prime time weekend hours here, though.

The atmosphere is pretttty cool.  Lot's of pretty waitresses and a western style ranch/ steakhouse feel with a modern twist on it.

The patio is pretty cool, too.  They have a few fire pits and a bar out there.  It's chill.

And the cake topper...A mechanical bull to watch scantily clad women fall off of after a few too many Blue Moons haha."}
{"text":"This place can be exciting, if your with a group of friends in the bar area. BUT, other then that it's not the greatest. All the food I have had here was just ok, nothing too special to write home about. The service we had the other day, SUCKED. Our waiter seriously had to be on something, he kept forgetting EVERY THING,. When we told the manager about it all he said was \"I'm sorry. Can I take your guys plates?\" I'm just like.. wow, he REALLY cares about what we had to say.. NOT. It's too overpriced for the food being just ok. I won't lie to you though, one drunken night I had a hell of a time on that damn mechanical bull."}
{"text":"I have been to Cadillac Ranch for lunch, dinner, on football Sunday's and happy hour.  I am never disappointed.  The staff is courteous and efficient.  I was recently part of a large group who walked in and they graciously set up a nice area for us and provided very prompt service.  I even started my bachelor party there and we had such a great time we stayed longer than we had originally intended!  Definitely try the pretzel and fondue appetizer if you go!"}
{"text":"Although the Cadillac Ranch is a visually attractive venue, its food is disappointingly bad. When one looks at the photos of its food offerings, it is easy to be impressed. But the food delivered to one's table is something  else again. 

I recently ordered one of their featured items-- a large bowl of chili. The bowl was  huge. However, there was very little chili and what there was war burnt and tasteless. They gave me a lot of colored tortilla chips, which I found totally unappetizing. Considering how the beans were  falling apart, I suspect that the chili was days old and simply reheated too many times. It wasn't nearly as good as the chili at Wendy's. 

It's a sad day when a joint that pretends to be upscale can't match the food of a fast food restaurant. 

On another occasion, I ordered a burger with fries--common enough fare. The burger was dry and tasteless and the fries were cold. Once again, it didn't equal the burgers turned out by a fast food restaurant. You would do a lot better with a Five Guys burger.

To sum it up, I consider the place to be a  pretentious dump."}
{"text":"My fiance and I really enjoy this place for happy hour.  The appetizers are half off and are good for the most part.  The pretzel fondue and sampler are really good, but the chicken fingers look like ET's fingers.  The drink specials are really good, the mixed drinks are tasty, my fiance loves the Rancherita.  We've always had good service and seem to make it in there at least once a month.  Also cool that you can get Best Buy Reward Zone Dining points there."}
{"text":"Come on a tuesday for the special (two entrees for the price of one) take advantage!"}
{"text":"Wish I could give 0 stars bad service over priced drinks sorry music will never go back!!!!! Promise u that u suck Cadillac Ranch!!!"}
{"text":"A couple of things to do:
    - Drink Beer at the Bar
    - Watch Sports
    - Ride the mechanical Bull
    -  AND Stay away from the food.

The food was not good. I got the Diablo Chicken Pasta. Although the warning messages on the menu about the dangers of eating meat was a pleasant reminder, it did not deter me from it. The Diablo Chicken Pasta tasted bland, mixed with penne pasta, some crushed peppers, and a MAC N Cheese taste. I love Mac N Cheese, but this was no bueno. Especially for 14.95!!! It wasn't spicy and overall it was  just a terrible dish.

Aside from that, the sandwiches also looked mundane. One item I would suggest is the Mushroom Lovers Pizza. That is if you love mushroom and flatbread pizza. 

This is definitely the kind of place where the environment and style undermines the food. The service was good. In fact, it was toooo good. A person would come and check on us every three-five minutes. First the manager, than another waitress, then our waitress. Afterwords, she came again and asked \"how we were.\" I don't mind the intrusion, it was just a little too much and annoying. 

Overall...B-
Great Environment and Unsatisfactory Food."}
{"text":"I bought a Groupon certificate for Cadillac Ranch several months ago and almost forgot about it.  I came across this site while searching for the address.  I was pretty upset when I saw so many negative reviews, but I already had the certificate, so we went anyway.  

We got there with pretty low expectations, and were pleasantly surprised with everything.  Our server's name was Chelsea, and if anything she was overly attentive, checking up on us to make sure everything was OK and to take away plates.  She was kind and patient, and didn't have any issues with the Groupon.

Our appetizer arrived at the same time as our entree which is about my only complaint, but we didn't have to wait too long for them.  We got the nachos with chicken and they were really good.  They put the toppings on individual round tortilla chips almost like little pizzas, but the result is different, and delicious.  My wife ordered chicken alfredo, and I got a beef dip sandwich, both of which were very tasty.

We did go on for lunch on Sunday afternoon, and the place wasn't too busy, so that could have been part of the reason we got such great service.  But who knows, maybe they're listening to all of the negative reviews on here and making some positive changes.  I would definitely go again, and hope that I get Chelsea again."}
{"text":"Such a great business. Had great experience with my friends and family. Came in on a Monday night to celebrate my BF's boyfriend. All drinks and food was half off!!! Crazy!!! Food and drinks were great. The drinks i could tell was made by someone who had great skills. Perfect blends, we had mixed drinks, beers and shots. Our bill came to $25, AMAZING so I left a $15 tip for the great experience and prices. Will be back!"}
{"text":"First of all, if you go here, PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE make sure you check your bill when it comes!  honestly.  We went here 3 times.  all 3 times we were over charged....  either the menu's were out of date, or we were \"past happy hour time\" (BS)... oh and the other excuse... we just changed our menu.  blah blah blah  P

then they always have to \"get a manager\" to come to the table, which takes forever!  (I am sure they hope we leave)  PLUS! THE SERVICE SUCKS ASS!!!!  this is a definitely bait and switch!

1st time it happened we just dealt with it, and was like, whatever...

2nd time it happened, my daughter who just got back from deployment (Navy) wanted to do something special for us and took us all there.  My husband looked at the check and noticed it wasy CRAZY over what we thought as we were there for happy hour.  The waitress had to get the manager which took over 20 minutes, (gimme a break)  finally we took a 30 dollar gift card because we were so sick of 'arguing about it.  We discussed it about 20 minutes and we were finally like, whatever...

3rd time...  took a friend there.  again we ordered devils ale.  on the menu it was listed at one price... when we got the bill, it was almost twice as much.  We waited for our server to come back, she never did, she totally ignored us.  I gave her a dollar tip (which is NOT like me, i tip very well, too well)  and I wrote on the recept why she got such little money as a tip.  

If you are looking for a fun time go caddy corner to San Filepe's  that place is fun and the staff are friendly and fun.  We much prefer there, we wll never go to Caddilac Ranch again.  They say 3rd time is a charm, Well, it is... its a charm to know you are overspending and its a big gimmick and they dont give a crap!

oh and if i didn't have to give a star, i wouldn't have."}
{"text":"I came here Sunday night for a pick up order. I had ordered the ahi tuna appetizer, green beans, and sweet potato fries. 

The tuna and green beans were great, but the fries were soggy, and the dipping sauce provided was gross. 

The customer service was lacking, as I had to ask the bartender upon entering to get my food as the host was not present. 

As the service and food was subpar, so is my rating."}
{"text":"Deplorable.

We were told it was open seating, so the hostess suggested we grab our own menus and seat ourselves. We sat for so long without acknowledgement from anyone, that I called the restaurant and complained from the table. Our waitress finally came out, she was frazzled and evidently pretty new, but she was sweet. The food was quite good, the drinks were horrific. At the end when we showed her our still more than half-full drinks, this is what transpired:
She told us it was their policy to charge you for the drink if you drank ANY of it. When we pointed out we had to TASTE the drinks, she got flustered. That's when she apologized and told us she should have tasted them first to make sure they were OK. We stared incredulously, I have never heard of waitresses sampling people's drinks for them, but we smiled politely and asked her to take the drinks off the bill (they were $9 and $12). She told us her manager had to do it and went to go talk to him. When she finally came back, he had only removed one drink, the $9 one. We told her that was unacceptable and to please send him to our table. In the next five minutes, he stormed by our table at least twice but never stopped, he pointedly ignored us. She came back and told us he was in a \"bad mood\" so she removed the $12 drink from the tab anyway. My guess is she gets docked $12 or fired.

Don't give this half-baked operation ANY of your money. The owner of Cadillac Grill should be ashamed to allow it to be run that way."}
{"text":"I made reservations at the Cadillac Ranch for my daughter's hs graduation. The main reason we chose this spot was because of the outdoor fire pit. There were no issues while making the reservations. The manager Tim was very accommodating, funny and friendly. That is, until half hour into my arrival when he called asking if I wanted to have it indoors due to the possibility of rain. It didn't really look like it would pour; however he subtly pushed for me to agree. So, in the midst of the crowd and taking pictures, I told him we would give it a shot (go indoors); with the idea of going back to my original reservation outside if it didn't look like rain. When we got there, they had set us up inside. It was nice and all but it was extremely loud and we wanted to be able to enjoy the breeze and have conversations. I mean, my family traveled hours to see my daughter graduate; why would we want to sit inside with loud music. Tim said he could turn down the music and we said no; because it's a bar/grill and people were hanging out. Then he admitted that one of the fire pits were broken and the other was taken. He said it had been broken for 2 days. So, here was the truth (it was so obvious what had happened)- They gave our spot, the only working fire pit, to another group; thinking they would leave before we got there. The group never left; therefore, my group got screwed over. But why lie about it? Anyway, we still chose to sit in the fire pit area; despite it being broken. From there, the waitress and Tim did their best to serve us and kept checking in to see if we were good. At the end,  Tim offered us free dessert for the inconvenience. It worked out well because I didn't have enough time to grab my daughter's graduation cake, balloons and champagne from my house, as it was completely out the way. The food was delicious! I ordered the Appetizer Buffet Option #2: bbq wings, sliders, shrimp cocktail, cheese and crackers, and tortillas with artichoke and spinach dip and a veggie tray with ranch. Half the people in our group barely ate and we were able to take the leftovers with us. Overall, despite the incident with the fire pit, I truly enjoyed the ambiance and will recommend this place to friends and family. I will definitely be back! Three stars for an honest review and fire pit disappointment."}
{"text":"So I hate to disagree with my new friend Rachel, but a small group of us ended up here last Saturday night.

First, Robinson was swamped.  Every place had long waits of an hour to two hours! While this wasn't our first choice, it ended up being very good!

We put in our four-top request at the hostess desk, and went into the bar.  The bar was jam-packed with people everywhere.  We managed to find a high table, and had some drinks.  The shots were huge, and the drinks were very affordable.  They were pushing a local vodka (http://www.cliquevodka.com/) and selling $5 martini's and $7 mixed drinks (but only charged us $5 for them?)

The service was slow in the bar, but they were very very busy!

We were seated within the time specified, and had a comfy booth over near the other bar.  Our waiter was prompt, friendly, helpful with menu selections.

The ladies had mostly appetizers and salads, and the men enjoyed the Cajun Shrimp and Sausage pasta.  The pasta was perfect --- a nice portion size, good amount of spicy kick, the sausage tasty, the shrimp not overcooked.

I was also struck by the reasonable prices --- both drink and food was great.

On another occasion, I had a strip steak that was pretty good --- although not stellar.  My wife was less than satisfied with her choice.

I was happy with the overall experience, and will definitely go again!"}
{"text":"Good food, cold draft beer and friendly service.  I enjoyed a fresh, wedge salad and the chicken Diablo pasta.  Both were good."}
{"text":"A very large group came here for a working reception. We got the back room and the food was set up along the wall. The service was pretty good. The sliders were ok; the cheese freshly cut; chips and dip a crowd pleaser. I didn't try the wings. Food was replenished relatively quickly. 
The place is open and airy and I liked the art on the walls. There are a lot of TVs. 
I would recommend the place for this type of outing."}
{"text":"NOTE: this is a FOLLOW UP of a second bad experience:

After receiving a hand-written card months after my last complaint and review, I thought \"OK for real this is the last shot.\" In all honesty, I really only wanted to go because the card said it would comp 2 drinks, an appetizer, and 2 entrees. 

My husband and I went tonight. We went to the front desk and immediately told the hostesses about the card and were promptly seated. Within 5 minutes of sitting down, Bill, a brand new manager who was having his second day today, sat down and talked to us. 

In all honestly, the food was just OK. There always seems to be a small enough issue with everything (ie the margarita is warmish, the chicken fingers are chewy, or the chicken parm's chicken part is burnt at the breadcrumb layer). The food quality is just below average. I will also mention, within minutes of getting home after dinner I felt sick to my stomach (coincidence or not? not sure). 

But the reason I am really updating my review is the fact that Bill came right over to us to make sure we felt acknowledged and to reassure us he would try his best as a mgr. The waitress was fine, and the service was perfectly acceptable. 

Although I won't likely EVER come back, I wanted to acknowledge the efforts of the staff the 3rd time of coming back with an issue. You may not have regained my \"business\" but you have earned a better review from me. I honestly can't give you more than 2 stars with all that I've been through, though."}
{"text":"So after two recent visits to Cadillac Ranch, I have come to the conclusion that I am unimpressed.  

First visit was just to the bar for a few drinks before a show.  The bar staff was inattentive and the simple drinks we ordered left much to be desired as neither had much alcohol present for the hefty price.  We got an appetizer after the bar maid described it to us only for it to come and not be anything like what was described.

Second visit was for dinner.  Two pasta dishes were ordered as well as Filet Mignon.  The pasta dishes were dry, bland and lacked ingredients that were mentioned to be present in the dish on the menu.  The Filet came drenched in A1 sauce.  

Once dinner was over, our waitress was no where to be found.  

This restaurant has a great atmosphere but must become more than a mediocre drinking hole."}
{"text":"I remember when Cadillac Ranch first opened many years ago .. it was the place to be for happy hour!  My visit for the first time in many months was a bit surprising. It was a Friday night - 9 PM and many empty bar stools.    It definitely has changed since the last time I visited. The service was good because it wasn't too crowded and the noise level was down a bit so it was ideal if you were trying to talk to someone... noise level down. 
  
After only 1 drink-- me and my friend decided to go somewhere else.   The atmosphere just wasn't cutting it for the good mood I was in... it was bit somber. 

I had to give at least three stars in this review because I have had many good visits in the past.. from happy hour gatherings, blind dates, and work function dinners.  I  just think maybe there's too much competition out at the point now."}
{"text":"Ok drinks in tempe market place may go back if we were in the neighborhood and wanted a quick drink."}
{"text":"I've been to CR numerous times for drinks with friends on the weekend and thought it would be a fun place to take a friend from Chicago.  Three of us went for a late lunch today and were extremely disappointed.  The service was not too impressive, especially considering it was very slow; we had to keep asking for drink refills and it took a long time to track down our server so we could pay our bill.  Even more disappointing was the food...it was overpriced and nothing was even \"ok\".  We ordered the queso dip appetizer, and we all agreed it tasted like Cheez Whiz and was very overpriced.  The caesar salad was soaked in dressing to the point it wasn't edible, and was served with a toast-like bread that was stale and tasteless. Two of us had carne asada dishes (a salad and the taco platter), and the meat was incredibly tough and bland...I ate 1/2 of a taco and couldn't choke down any more.  This was one friend's first experience with carne asada, and we had to assure her that this is NOTHING like true carne asada.  I would never go back to CR for the food...there are a lot better places to eat at Tempe Marketplace."}
{"text":"Overpriced, food wasn't very good, the service was only decent. If you go to Cadillac Ranch go for the eye candy and the bar on a Friday or Saturday night otherwise you will walk out feeling like you just kissed your sister... yeah I said it!"}
{"text":"I wish that I could give it better reviews but that is ok...I would give it 4 stars if it was solely based on the fact that I have had some great times there...I mean you cannot beat $3.50 margaritas for happy hour and half off appetizers...The few times I have been here the service has not been very good...they haveliterally had us waiting for our food and drinks forever and when we asked about it they seemed insulted that we would ask after waiting for such a long time.  The food is average nothing too fantastic but not bad...the margaritas are nothing too special either but they do the trick!!  I have had great times here...they have a mechanical bull that is sooooooooooooooo much fun espcially after some drinks!  Its a fun place but do not go there expecting the greatest food or drinks!  The nice part about this place is that its fairly large and there is alot of space so you do not feel like you are on top of everyone!"}
{"text":"I just got back from Cadillac Ranch, and I thought it was alright. I went with a group of fifteen people, so its definitely good for groups. I thought the food was a little over priced for what you got. I got the BBQ chicken salad and its was decent. The service was pretty good, a little slow but then again we did have a big group. The place wasn't too crowded so no one was riding the bull, but the place was decorated cutely. Overall it was just like any other themed restaurant, good decorations with a over priced menu."}
{"text":"The service was awesome. The waitress was very attentive. The food was a completely different story. It was awful. Bland and tasteless. I ordered fish tacos, they had no flavor or spice. The salsa that accompanied the meal had no heat whatsoever. I don't like things too hot but this is Arizona, at least get the salsa right. My husband ordered the green chili chicken philly with fondue cheese, it was extremely bland and my husband who is not picky even went as far to say that it was disgusting. The kids ordered pretzels with the fondue cheese. There food was probably the best but that's not saying too much."}
{"text":"Came here for the after party to Angela H's UYE at Firefly. I think at this point we were down to just 6. We came here because some of Angela's friends were coming here. 

The drinks were half off which was cool. I ordered a Snake Bite , but the waitress came back and said they were out of pear cider. I settled for a Black & Tan. They brought back a just Black. When questioned about the Black & Tan, the bartender came out and gave us some bull shit excuse. I could've went back there and poured one for myself. After the third attempt...I was just getting irritated.

So I guess we came here on a night when they had a live band playing. I think it was about 20 after we got here, the band started to play and it was loud. It got so effin loud, I couldn't even hear the voices in my head. We decided to leave and continue out party downstairs at Yard House."}
{"text":"I go to cadillac ranch 2 times every month but this past weekend, i went to the bar towards the back, it was crowded....and was wondering why. First time I seen a DJ on the balcony area....everyone at the bar area was enjoying the DJ......you should have that dj there every weekend!! the music was better than the music that was inside the main floor.....anyways hope to see that dj at the balcony there more often...."}
{"text":"This was one of the few spots in the Town Square Mall we found that didn't look crowded so we decided to check it out.

We ordered a bunch of comfort food, plates of tacos and fixings and there was a platter of fries as well.  We were completely \"carbed up\" after our trip to the movie theater nearby in the mall.  I guess after seeing the movie Red, (it was a bit of an action flick) you get a little hungry.  :)

The server was continually on top of the action and made sure we had everything we needed.

I looks like this place is somewhat of a night spot later in the evening which is totally not my scene but might be worth checking out if you are in the 20 something bracket.

All in all I thought it was a good, solid place to get your standard burger, etc., fare and would probably try it again."}
{"text":"Smokers paradise!  It's a stink hole because of the \"outside\" bar.  It's a joke, really.  I think the smoke-free laws are being violated here.  My family and I won't be back.

Wish I could give this cruddy place NO STARS."}
{"text":"I went there a couple months back: they are good for drinks and that's about it.  Basically they know you're there for the atmosphere and drinks.  Food quality is poor.  I expected much more from their rib combo.  Basically another cookie-cutter chain."}
{"text":"This place is VERY loud, and very dark (couldn't see the menu @ lunch time) and though the food was OK at best, the service is really lacking. I went with a group of coworkers for a b-day lunch yesterday and we all split the check (paid one bill though, didn't \"inconvenience\" the server and have her put each meal on a different ticket). Three people paid with cash, and two with debit (including Me). 

I had a water and a French dip, which was more like a cheese steak with some salty dipping sauce,(the fries were tasty though) anyhow when the server returned with my charge receipt I noticed my bill was about $2.50 more than I had anticipated, so I questioned why when I had a meal that was $10.99 I was charged nearly $14? She replied, and matter of factly I must add \"there wasn't enough cash to cover one of the Iced Teas on the bill\"...So I replied, \"but I did not have an Iced tea\" e.g. who gave you the right to just charge me for something I didn't have???? She should have come back to the table and stated, \"there was not enough cash to cover one of your drinks, therefore, the bill was short, so some one will have to make up the difference\" NOT go ahead and just charge one of the CC because it was easier....So this twit asks me \"uh, do you like, want me to take it off\" and of course she had a blank stare on her dumb face....

So being totally frustrated and in the name of time I told her no (I feel the need to mention all of our lunches came out at different time, and she had messed up a few of the orders, maybe she should have written stuff down, so I didn't want her to drop dead with confusion).....I should have forced her to...Anyway I have decided that I am going to call management today to express my malcontent!

UPDATE: I did contact the managers about the service issue I had and they offered me a free appetizer which I think is really nice, and good mitigation practices but I still won't go back..just too many other good places!"}
{"text":"Went here last night for a friend of a friend's birthday party and it wasn't too much of a party to say the least. We were in the VIP section on the patio and got through security pretty quickly upon entering, and the place was super packed. We got a drink up at the bar and went back to the patio. They charge $9 for a teeny tiny rum & coke which is ridiculous but expected in Vegas. But then when my friend's boyfriend went back to the bar again for a second round for my friend, it was $7 and in a plastic albeit bigger glass. WTF? I guess you have to get the right bartender who isn't going to screw you over. 

When I went for my drink (a $10 Rock Candy) I unfortunately had the previous bartender and it was small, and was way too sour, not the way I had remembered the drink. Ick. 

Now the reason we had to go to the bar all the time was because the waitress for the VIP area completely ignored us. She asked everyone else around if they needed anything, but not us.  

I'm giving this an extra star because this is the only place in Las Vegas where karma comes around faster than usual. Literally moments after making fun of some girl's hideous outfit, she falls over in her chair. And that douchebag in True Religion who hit on you at the bar will fall off the bull faster than it took for him to get off of you. 

The crowd was very meh for being so busy. It seemed like every girl there was skanktastic, and every guy was in an embroidered button-down and light-washed jeans with whiskering. Eww. At least we got to see a Snooki lookalike grinding like crazy and a stripper ride the bull. Ahh, Vegas. When there is a mechanical bull, all bets are off. Just make sure you find a bartender who won't stiff you and this place could possibly be alright with the right crowd."}
{"text":"I went out to Cadillac Ranch on Saturday. There were seven of us, there was a $10 cover for all of us including the girls. They do not accept cards so we had to use their ATM, which had a ridiculous charge of $3 to withdraw money. They girl working the cover charge desk was so rude and kept on giving us looks. Once we all paid we went in there it wasn't worth the money whatsoever! It was so slow,not a very big crowd at all. It took us 15 minutes to get drinks because the bartenders were too busy talking. I am super disappointed, I surely will not be recommending this place to anyone, not will I ever go again."}
{"text":"Not a fan. I visited here 4 times over a year ago. Thought the food was mediocre at best. The atmosphere was cool and the service OK. Not interested in returning. Have lots of other options. The atmosphere is unique and cool, but not enough to return."}
{"text":"Traveling through Pittsburgh and found this gem!  
Don't let the star ratings scare you away because the food was really good and the service was awesome as well. No plans to return to Pittsburgh but if we ever do, we'll definitely come back for dinner and drinks."}
{"text":"We went here this afternoon for lunch, it was pretty nice. The service was really great! A lot of young servers and bar tenders...a mechanical bull, and I believe Karaoke. Because it was the 4th they had this Bar B Que deal for $5 you get a hamburger, potato salad or hot dog... not bad. We opted for a light lunch, 1 appetizer flat bread pizza and 3 house salads. The salads were great, they were $7 each but they were filling, full of romaine lettuce, tomatoes, julienne pepperoni's, cheese...the house dressing is yummy. 

Its kind of got a party atmosphere to it...they were passing around Jello Shots etc...

Our total bill came out to $50.00 without alcohol...so its a bit pricey for a light lunch but plenty of food. We didn't even finish the pizza."}
{"text":"I got stuff i could digest after waiting 2 hours to be seated and being told 15 minutes.  It was not worth it.  Enjoy your lean cuisine!"}
{"text":"Well we returned to caddy ranch for dinner, as the management really does care about the reviews, we were invited back for a \"make up\" dinner...   BLOWN AWAY.  Like I said before, the food was phenomenal my  chicken fried steak was AMAZING.. I'm sure the reason for inviting us back was not to pad the review or get me to change what i said, just to change my outlook on the establishment, which they did indeed.. prob would just take my own advice and realize the food is AWESOME and original , and above all they really do care about whether you would return or suggest them to friends. I will definitely do both now!!!    Good Job Caddy Ranch!!"}
{"text":"Meh. 

This place kind of sucks. It's not horrible, but it's not really good.

I judge a place based on menu, drink options, but in this case, atmosphere. The vibe is a bit lame, and for a weekend night, it wasn't very full. 

We popped in for a bit as the night began, but promptly moved over to Blue Martini. As the night began to dwindle, we came back to this place, and noticed a massive line outside, but the crowd was lame, inside wasn't full (I can see why), and I didn't really have a good time.

I don't think I would come back, unless I had no other choice. Thankfully, I do."}
{"text":"Stopped in for drink before movie. 2pm. 
Only one guest at bar. 
Was waiting for bartender. 
2 other guests came in and the bartender decided to greet and serve them instead. I left. 

7/29/16
Manager invited me back & gave me a gift card. 
We ate on the outdoor patio with its own bar. It's a really nice patio. The Passion Fruit mojito is very delicious but light on the rum. Can't wait to try more of their cocktails. The service and food were good. The music on the inside is too loud but nice on the patio minus the live performer outside making it loud."}
{"text":"We got in, sat in our table, waited 10-12 mins, no one showed up to say hi or take our order- we left :-/"}
{"text":"I haven't been here for years but I have a group that we meet once a month for a happy hour and then head over to the cinema for a movie around 7pm.  I didn't make a reservation because the last time we met there it wasn't crowded, maybe because the kitchen caught on fire and they couldn't do anything but serve drinks so we drank.

So needless to say it was crowded but the hostesses at the door were very friendly so we all gathered around the seats available and ordered the happy hour specials.  I didn't expect much since they were so reasonable.  Wrong!  Everyone raved on what they ordered, the pulled pork sliders excellent, a couple of us ordered those, Ben ordered the fish tacos, he couldn't rave enough about them! did he share NO! So the next time I will have to try them. The truffle infused French fries very good, not greasy, glad that I got to try them, some ordered some other things on the menu and all were happy with their food they couldn't say enough about what they had... again do you think they offered to share? Not!

Our server was stressed but it was very busy and she was doing a good job

So if you decide to go .. have an open mind, a forgiving heart if everything isn't just your way.. the food was good and I am looking to go back and try other things.

{"text":"Cadillac Ranch seems like the Scottsdale away from Scottsdale. I've been here a few times and the crowd has always seemed stuck up.  I can't comment on the food as I've never tried it... so all I'm commenting on is the bar hoppers and the bar tenders.

The bar staff was nice one time... but I think it was just because I went there when it was slow and they (she) would come talk to me. However, the other time I went I may as well jumped behind the bar and made my drink myself... I'm not even sure they would have noticed. Maybe this isn't a slam to the bartenders themselves as maybe they were understaffed... as it was to the owners. 

I dunno... I just haven't had the best time here."}
{"text":"Get a new chef! 

The lobster bisque was aggressively salty and had some strange artificial aftertaste. Not good at all. The shrimp tacos were pathetic. One shrimp per taco does not a taco make. 

Our server was fantastic and honest but the food is reprehensible. I wouldn't give it to a rat."}
{"text":"Went to Cadillac Ranch for the first time last night with a big group of friends (about 12 of us) for a birthday get-together. We got there around 8pm and started ordering drinks and food. The waitress was attentive, so that's a plus, but the food and drinks were not very good and they were very overpriced. 

I ordered the nachos... and what do they bring me? A plate of small tostadas! WTF?! Also, they burnt the chicken they put on top of these tostadas. Every bite was 50/50 between dry bland food and gross burnt flavor. So then I ordered chicken strips and fries. While the fries were pretty good, the chicken was very bland and kind of chewy. 

Now for the drinks... the birthday girl had quite a few and I tried a bit of each. Most of them were really tart and honestly hard to drink. I had the big blue punch-bowl drink with the Red Bull in it... and while it was a decent (3-star) drink, there's no way in hell it's worth $14. 

Up until 10pm, this place is a solid 2 stars. However, after 10pm they brought out a terrible DJ and cranked the music up so loud we couldn't hear each other anymore. The music was terrible, way too loud, and it totally ruined the conversation we were all having. Around this time about half of our group left. The only reason we stayed is because a few people were still on their way, so we tried to make the best of it and we stayed until 11:30pm.

The comments from just about everyone in our 12 person group were... \"Wow, this place isn't very good, is it?\" or \"Where did our waitress go? After 10pm they simply abandoned us over here, didn't they?\"

All in all, great company at our table... but this place sucks."}
{"text":"Nothing special just a typical chain place with ok food.  A few of us stopped here before heading to movie. Menu has a variety of food to choice from and drinks are good. Server was nice and responsive."}
{"text":"I've gone to Cadillac Ranch for different occasions, from personal to business meetings. 

Overall, the environment and vibe is nice for any occasion. The space itself is decorated nicely, giving you the option to watch a variety of TVs or chat with whomever you're with. The food is average, my favorite being the alarm burger and tortilla soup. The outside patio looks like a great place to eat and I hope to eat there when I return"}
{"text":"By far one of the best steaks I've ever had, cooked to perfection. The chefs sure know what they're doing. And the butter that comes on top is the things dreams are made of! I've been to this location numerous times and I have never had a bad experience. The staff and managers are so accommodating and truly care about your experience. Highly recommend Cadillac Ranch! Can't say enough amazing things about this place! Definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"Went for the first time on Mother's Day. Staff was polite and friendly. Food all came out exactly as ordered and in a timely fashion. Overall great experience"}
{"text":"I am sad this place had to close, whatever the real reason. I miss my bacon won-tons!"}
{"text":"Went to CR for dinner with Mom and my lovely wife. Two of us had the chicken pot pie. It was unlike any cpp  I've ever had. It consisted of a mashed potato foundation, a dusting of veggies, all topped with thick turkey gravy.  The flakey pastry piece consisted of two triangles that looked like apple turnovers without the fruit, on the side of the bowel. The few chicken pieces included a multitude of chicken neck bones and the chicken tail, were disappointing. We both spent time in the bathroom within 1 hour of dinner. They get one star because the waitress was nice."}
{"text":"Update!!.... manager reached out to me about my experience. I admire the business for wanting to be better and inviting me in again. I will def. Be back to do another review on service but thank you for reaching out.



Just left.... 1st night out after 6 months because I had a baby. Me and my husband just wanted to have a drink at a bar ... Cadillac ranch seemed to be the best choice. The 1st bar was full so we sat on the side bar... NOT GREETED FOR 8 MINUTES.  .. heard the couple next to us ask the bartender to take their order... \"I'm not a bar tender\". ... sat and still waited. NOTHING.  ... come on -try!!!  .... such a waste on 20 min.. we are now taking our dinner and drinks down the road. ... . Don't go.."}
{"text":"I was extremely disappointed with this place.. We had a large party for my birthday (15 people) last night and after we got to our table INside I had reserved a week before requesting outdoor seating weather permitting (it was beautiful out) one of the 2 servers we had said to us \"are you done moving seats yet?\" In a snotty tone which was her attitude the whole time... Then we got or drinks and ordered our food... Everyone got their food except me (I ordered fish and chips) and the other server apologized saying there was a mix up, it would be out in 2 minutes. That would have been fine except that i t didn't come out 2 mins later it came out an HOUR AND 13 MINS later.... The manager comped my meal but didn't bother to apologize to me... The servers brought out shots for everyone and didn't say it was from them so everyone at my table was asking each other who ordered them, it was very confusing.... And my fish was not good it was pretty much all batter w a hint of fish inside.... I was thoroughly upset that my birthday dinner was a huge let down w the awful service and not so great meal... Others at my table got the fish tacos and they were good.. But that is the only positive thing I can say unfortunately"}
{"text":"I thought Cadillac ranch had a great set up inside with plenty of space and a nice set up outside with someone playing music. I also had a sirloin steak which I thought was great and well seasoned. my only complaint would be pricey drinks"}
{"text":"I would tear a hamstring to run as fast as I could from this place. Went there for the first time last night. Food is gross. Service sucks. It's uncomfortable. There really isn't one good thing I can say about it. Run away. You'll thank me."}
{"text":"This is a steakhouse that is all about the atmosphere. They do really awesome happy hour specials and it's a fun place to be! A huge central bar and even a second bar off to the side. I think the entrees and regular food are a little overpriced for what you get, but it's not a bad place to check out if you're in the area! Service was wonderful."}
{"text":"Tried the 3 Taco combination on Sunday for $9.99. This is a pretty good deal consisting of three tacos of your choice loaded with meat (chicken and carne asada) on flour tortillas and then chips and salsa is served with the dish. The female bartender also included an extra order of Chips with salsa and queso which she said cmae with the tacos, even though there was already chips/salsa on my plate. Carne asada had a nice chipotle sauce and chicken was long strips of marinated white meat. As the only bar open at 11AM for Sunday football, place was empty til about 1pm, so manager will put whatever game you need on the bar TV's. The only issue is that they should have some kind of Sunday football food specials or keep the apps at 1/2 price. They did have $1 Coors light drafts, so that helped."}
{"text":"The food here is really good.... 
HOWEVER, it does not overcome the fact that the service is awful!!!  When I say awful, it is hands down the WORST service that I have ever received in any service industry establishment.  I travel all over the US for months at a time and this is the slowest and poorest service I have ever received!
And to top it off the bartender who my wife and I once did receive decent service from, I tipped him $50 and the next time we came In, he was too busy flirting with a girl that was sitting at the bar and asked a server to come wait on us instead.  It's a shame that with such great food, that it takes hours to get your food and it takes hours to get a drink because the bartender Is too busy fitting with the women at the bar!  Hopefully the cooks leave and start a new restaurant and leave all the servers and bartenders behind."}
{"text":"This place bothers me.  I already everything about country so going to these kind of places freaks me out.  I was forced to go here because the boyfriends parents were in town and they choose Cadillac Ranch due to their type of \"cuisine\". I have to say the foo d wasn't bad.  Server messed up my order but when they got it right it was ok.  I will not go here again however.  Sorry."}
{"text":"I've been going back and forth as to how many stars this place should get.  I finally decided on 2 because I can't award 1/2 a star and feel 3 stars is too many.

My friends and I visited on a Saturday afternoon.  We entered and asked if we could sit in the bar area but we wouldn't be able to sit at the bar because there were too many of us.  The hostess was very short and said she would get something for us and be right back, then, she disappeared.  When she came back she led us to the furthest table from the bar.  Not what we wanted or asked for.  We decided we were going to ask for a table at the bar and was informed that outside was open seating- this would've helped when we asked the first time but, whatever.

Our server was not the sunniest bulb in the box, meaning, she was not friendly.  Gosh, I hate that and it put me in a bad mood.  Last time I checked, she was there to help us at her own will, not against it.  Geesh.  We all had a couple drinks and some of us had appetizers.  They were good but nothing to write home about.  Bar food.

My favorite part of the evening was when my friends rode the bull.  It was entertaining.

So, in closing, go to ride the bull and then get the hell out of there.  Well, maybe stop at the bar and grab a drink first."}
{"text":"This place confuses me. It seems to try to be a classier version of Texas Roadhouse with having food half as good (let's be real, TRH has amazing ribs). I had the Asian Salad, for which I don't remember the exact name, and it was OK. It wasn't bad, but I thought the prices for everything were ridiculous. None of the appetizers were less than about $8 and the cheapest glass of wine was $8 or $9. Not that I think it's out of line or even all that much, but if I'm going to spend that much, then I could easily greatly increase the quality and \"cool\" factor by choosing a restaurant in the city."}
{"text":"Overpriced.  Caloric-ally dense.  And uneven service.

Sometimes it's a hit.  Sometimes it's a disaster.

...but it is always pricey."}
{"text":"If you like salad at all you HAVE to try the two apples spinach salad with steak. OMG. So. Good. It would almost be worth the drive back from KY just to have it again...the nachos are delicious too!"}
{"text":"We haven't found many lively places to have dinner on a Sunday night in AZ.  So we usually end up at Kabuki in Tempe Market Place.  Last Sunday, we ended up in Tempe Market Place again but didn't feel like sushi so we decided to go here.

For a sports bar, this place is surprisingly nice inside.  We were seated in one of the booth with huge screen, we ordered our food, and the order didn't take long to get to our table.

*Spinach and mushroom quesadilla - pretty yummy.  it wasn't oily at all
*Black N Blue - it was....interesting but a little too weird...the gravy was a little burnt and you really, truly have to love blue cheese.
*Grilled Pastrami Sliders - pretty good.  again, it wasn't oil or dry.

*Location = very lively
*Decor = cool for a sports bar
*Food = ok
*Price = a little on a high end for a sports bar"}
{"text":"The interior and exterior design is inciting. They play music videos: country, rock, 80's, a little of everything - at least when I was there. The food and service didn't stand out. Basically the usual gourmet American food. There wasn't really anything exciting about it or unique but the restrooms were nice."}
{"text":"Were seated on the patio and then told there were no servers for the patio... after a server for the remaining table passed us 6 times to wait on a remaining table at 9pm on a beautiful Friday evening after a movie.   

Please also clear the tables and WIPE THEM OFF, filthy.  Looked inside, not even crowded.  Staff stands around and bullshits with one another, Your food isn't good enough for people to be expected to put up with this.  Won't be back for a 3rd try."}
{"text":"My good friend and I went for happy hour. It was from 5-7pm and we sat at the bar.

The drink specials are pretty good. I think it was a dollar off drafts.

They have a good menu for happy hour. They have food for 3-8 bucks I believe. I had the pizza and it was delicious! It was a decent portion as well. 

He had a good time and the bar wasn't crowded. I would suggest happy hour. The seating is pretty good with a nice patio.

I will definitely go back here for happy hour."}
{"text":"Order dinner from this place last night for 10 people.  I personally had the green chili chicken philly which came with burnt chicken and was lacking cheese.  Every single person in the party had at least 1 issue with their meal.  No one in our party completed their meal and all agreed this place is a no go in the future.  If you are looking for decent food stay away.  Thoroughly disappointed and shocked that out of 10 different dishes there was not 1 that was enjoyed.  Would give it a 0 if I could"}
{"text":"First time here. Loud!  Food just ok and that includes their specialties. Service just ok but mainly because our poor waitress was all over the restaurant. Her station was everywhere!  Could not give good service if she tried. Dirty plates left on table the whole meal. It would take a lot to get me back here."}
{"text":"I was there on a Sunday afternoon . We sat at the bar had drinks and appetizers . The place is very dark but I guess that's good if you want to watch sports on their many televisions . The service was poor . The place was not crowded at all but the bartender either didn't notice us when we sat down or ignored on purpose . After sitting for 5 minutes , I got up walked around to the other side of the bar and asked for some service and menus . The bartender handed us menus wihout saying too much of anything . The speciality drink menu is limited and I felt pricey . I had a pizza at the bar and that was good . All and all not a bad place and with a friendlier staff this place could be fun for happy hours and later on a Friday or Saturday night . They do have a mechanical bull to ride but we were told that it only operates after 10 pm on wednesday to Saturday nights ???  Why so limited hours for something that would be fun anytime , I don't know ."}
{"text":"How hard is it to mess up a Pittsburgh Steak Salad?  Not hard if you come here.

Service was a little slow considering the place was almost empty. The fries on it were hard (and I mean crunchy hard) and the steak on both my salad and my wife's salad was undercooked.  When we complained about it our waitress did nothing to make it better, just apologized and told us she'd let the kitchen know.

Would have gotten a better review if they had actually fixed the issues, would not have been that difficult."}
{"text":"Went tonight to watch the UFC!  Great place to watch the UFC.  No cover.  Volume turned up and the fights are shown on every screen.  Not a bad seat in the house to watch the fights.  Waiter was very attentive, but not bothersome during the fight.  They even offered drink specials (well....their gigantic 100 oz tower for $20 is a great deal in Vegas).  Their were promo girls too offering free shots.  

The food was pretty good too.  We started off with the Kettle Chips app.  Very creative app.  We enjoyed it.  Watching others orders come to the table we realized we needed to split our meal.  SUPER LARGE PORTIONS!  We had the house salad and the Mac N Cheese.  Both were great and more than filling when split b/t the two of us.  I did order a specialty drink...it was good, not worth $12 but not bad to sip on.  

Overall, a great place to watch the UFC.  Wish it was back home in Texas."}
{"text":"Very disappointing. Overpriced for what they serve. The turkey dinner was pressed turkey breast. The stuffing was soggy. My husband couldn't even finish cause it was so bad. I had the fish tacos which were good, but they must have used gold fish on each taco. Skimpy for the price of the meal. The worst part was I finished my drink almost completely before I realized my glass was filthy dirty! Ugh. 
Last time I'm going here. Proceed with caution"}
{"text":"I chose the BBQ chicken salad, which our server said was top notch and his fave item.  My friends got burgers and slider meals.  

What I got was salad greens topped with battered, deep fried, blah tasting chicken fingers,  cut into pieces, and a bunch of BBQ sauce dumped on top.  Say what?  It's a great looking place and probably cost millions... can't they grill up some fresh chicken rather than serve bagged/frozen/breaded stuff?  

The burgers got ok reviews, though the fries were of the heavily seasoned type that get old after 5.  The friend didn't like the pulled pork sliders.  Overall it was pretty blah, chain-like food that when coupled with drinks, makes for an overpriced, underwhelming experience."}
{"text":"If you enjoy eating pita bread carne Asada tacos, bland rice & black beans mixed with  some chili pepper, then this is the entrée for you!

We decided to have dinner there as the crew was setting up for NYE. They sat us in the back of the restaurant, off to the left of the stage. We were the only ones sitting there so we were very secluded from the rest of the restaurant crowd, we almost felt as if we got in trouble sitting there all alone. 

The server was very nice & very excited that Omarion was going to be performing for their NYE festivities. 

Our food came out in no time, which was a pleasant surprise. I ordered the carne Asada tacos. Presentation was nice. The black beans however looked as if there were bugs in it. It turned out there was chili pepper in it which made it difficult for this person to eat since I have an allergy. This was not mentioned in the menu on the plates description. The menu did day lime-cilantro rice. But what was served was white rice w some corn kernels mixed thru. The rice had no flavor whatsoever. I was unable to even apply some salt or pepper to help salvage it, since none was brought to the table & our server was no where to be found. to ask for any. 

The carne Asada tacos were ok. The meat was tender & the sauce on top of the lettuce was tasty. The menu mentioned the tacos would be on corn tortillas, but what was on the plate was more like a very small pita bread. These tacos saved the plate from the sides it was served with. 



Happy eating!"}
{"text":"BAR ONLY REVIEW.
2 Star Beer, 3 Star Cocktails, 1 Star Service.

Sorry to beat a dead horse but avoid this place if possible. That being said if you need a drink at Tempe Marketplace your options are limited and this is normally the only bar with empty seats in the whole marketplace on Fri/Sat nights."}
{"text":"Unlike a lot of the other reviewers, I actually had a decent experience here. We came in yesterday (Sunday) around 2. The place was pretty quiet, excluding the plethora of football fans who came here to watch their games. They have a ton of TVs to do so, including a HUGE screen that was playing the Cardinals game. No complaints about that. Some of the guys were rowdy but hey so am I when I watch football. It took us a while to be seated. I'm not quite sure where the hostess was. As soon as we were seated we were helped by a very pretty and sweet girl. Our food took a while even though the place was pretty dead, but what we got was satisfying. We started with the nachos which were really good and then I got their jalapeno burger and my friend got their pork sandwich sliders. The fries were seasoned well and crispy. The service needs some work: nonexistent hostesses, disappearing servers, slow cooks, but this place could be a real gem."}
{"text":"Come here at your own risk. Been here twice. The first time horible service.. the second time with amazing service. You never know what your going to get

The 1st time;
we were  here with his coworkers [celebrating his coworkers new job] and my family/friends [celebrating my 21st birthday]. The place was empty. i would say there were only 3 other tables other than us and it was 7pm on a monday night. 

Food/Drinks; Delish. Even better they were half priced. Wings were hot/perfect. Spinach dip was very tasty and chunky. Mozzorella sticks were amazing.

Service; HORRIBLE. The girl gave us attitude, forgot food, brought us our drinks 25 mins later AND messed up our checks 3 TIMES!

Positive Note; Manager gave us two free shots and a 50 dollar gift certificate since it was my birthday

The 2nd time; 
Used the 50 dollar gift certificate on a monday around lunch time, maybe 2 pm.

Food/Drinks;
Got the lunch special which was he perfect size. Husband got the chicken chipotle wrap/bacon&potato soup and he loved it :) I got the pork sandwich/caesar salad which i would have to say was the best tasting one i've ever had. no exaggeration. Next we had drinks. I had a strawberry banana rum margarita. So scrumpcious. Hubby had a martini and a mai ti drink. He liked them. Even asked for the exact alcohol in the martini so we could buy it. Desert was the best! The waitress told us about deep fried cheesecake thats coated with cinnamon and as raspberry sauce on it. Its not on the menu. Its a secret! ASK FOR IT! 

Service; AMAZING. a total 360 from the first visit. 

I guess the 3rd visit will have to be the tie breaker."}
{"text":"I've been here 4 times for informal meetings.  I'm guessing it gets picked because of perceived central location 101 & 202--or for people coming from Scottsdale and it's easy.
The service is slow and not good.  Better to men than women, but you are ignored quite a bit, even when it's slow.  It's loud.
I do not like the service or atmosphere, and there is limited selection of appetizer kind of food to share.  They're almost single serving, but at appetizer prices.  Go somewhere else.  And they wont' even mind here if you do--oblivion is the name of the service I see."}
{"text":"Pathetic. 3 out of 4 in our party got sick. Don't waste your money on this place. Sir poops A-lot"}
{"text":"5bucks to get in not even to drink. Seriously? Oh I didn't mention about the lame crowd over there! Bunch of showed off kids with no manner just wanna trigger fights! Music is okay. 

Anyway, I came back the other night and Only one thing I like is they mix drinks really good! 5 stars for drinks and 2 stars for atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Went here for lunch before heading home for California. 

I was three other people and all of our food was incredibly plain and bland. Absolutely no flavor, I could not even eat it. 

Service was pretty slow for the place being dead on a Sunday afternoon.

Waste of time and money on crappy food."}
{"text":"Just wonderful.   Had the blackened tilapia sandwich and it was lovely, the accompanying potatoes with cream sauce were super."}
{"text":"Leave it to me to go to a red meat based restaurant and order the lunch fish and chips! BIG mistake! LOL!!!

Do Not order the fish and chips!

I sat on the outside verandah and although the seating was nice, the mall music was too annoying with the restaurant background noise.

It seems like most of these places I am finding in the East valley are geared toward a high Alcohol sales platform with very large bars and seating in those areas.

I may try a burger or steak perhaps in the future."}
{"text":"I had a hamburger and it was disgusting. Yucky."}
{"text":"The bone-in Rib-Eye is excellent!  They even have a very good wedge salad, but it can't compare to Outback.  But who goes to a steak house for a salad, anyway.  The service is usually pretty good.  It's usually noisy, even during somewhat slow times due to the TVs all over the place and music playing.  It's definitely not a place for a romantic meal.  But the food is really good."}
{"text":"I was really excited to try out Cadillac Ranch for a few reasons, first and perhaps most shallowly, because their logo is a big 'CR' - my initials... it must be love, right? Second because I have been seeking out a fun place to spend my 30th birthday party which is quickly approaching and wanted to give this place a practice run. Cadillac Ranch looks cool and there is a neat looking fire pit outside that I imagined my friends and I clinking drinks around and ringing in my new decade. I went for lunch with my beau and my first experience was that the hostess was fairly unfriendly. To me, a hostess is a huge part of an experience at a restaurant because that is your first impression of a place and I am a customer service snob. We wanted to sit outside and she asked if high tables (bar tables) were okay. Sure! We get outside and it turns out the high tables she referred to were actually in direct sunlight. This is Vegas, and at 1 p.m. in Las Vegas in direct sunlight it is no fun! The question shouldn't have been if we minded high tables, but if we would have minded sitting in the sun, in which case our answer would have been yes. There were a few tables outside that were unoccupied but that hadn't been cleaned. We asked our server, who was nice but an airhead, if we could move once one of them was cleared off. Finally a table was cleared and was waiting to be wiped down, but the unfriendly hostess managed to come out with another group of people at the same moment and between the hostess and our waiter there was about to be a cat fight. She didn't know that table hadn't even been cleaned with a rag and was going to sit people there which grossed me out. Eventually another dirty table not in the sun was cleaned for the second party and everyone was happy, although I was beginning to wonder if there was a busser at this restaurant, or what? Our food came out quickly, my boyfriend a burger and me a margherita pizza. The pizza was good and I was pleasantly surprised at the turnaround time on the order considering the obvious inexperience of the serving staff. Throughout the meal my boyfriend, who is a very thirsty person for some reason, had absolutely no water left in his glass. He asked not once, not twice, but 3 times for more water - he even drank all of mine! The manager was wandering around and asked how everything was and I mentioned that we had asked for water three times and as of yet, nothing. I really liked my server's personality and I felt bad getting him into trouble, but geez, get us our dang water! The only saving grace of this restaurant is the location, our experience with a friendly but all-in-all terrible server, and the food was okay. No 30th birthday party for this girl!"}
{"text":"Ho-hum food, about like a Applebee's or Chili's. What I had was way too salty. Decent enough service."}
{"text":"Service - excellent
Food - meh

Came in on a Thursday and it was so quiet you coulda heard a pin drop. Guess we missed the rush. 

Waiter was super friendly, as was the manager who checked in on us.

Food was a major disappointment. We started with potato chips covered in cheese sauce and a balsamic reduction - pretty tasty. Sadly, though, we kept coming back to our appetizer because our entrees were a real disappointment.

I had the barbeque chicken pizza which was a gigantic portion. Too bad it was so lackluster in flavor. The barbeque sauce was just a drizzle over the top, not the base of the pie. It was luke warm, hard to cut and just an overall downer of a dish.

My date had macaroni and cheese and it was insanely bland. Seriously.

On a positive note, vouchers from restaurant.com are inclusive of alcohol."}
{"text":"DO NOT GO.   poor service.  ordered our meals and it took 70 minutes to arrive.   Found out that our 'server' did not put the order in for 30 minutes and made excuse that it was busy.   It was moderately crowded--sat right down and there were empty tables.  Food was good.  Service was lousy.  Sticky floors, not clean."}
{"text":"Went on New Year's Eve.  Total waste.  Food was cold, under cooked, delivered incomplete and unseasoned.  Best thing was the hot pretzel!"}
{"text":"I came with a group of nine girls to celebrate my birthday.  The restaurant was VERY loud at 7pm on a Saturday night.  It was almost impossible to talk with the person sitting across from you.  I ordered a mojito and it was the only disgusting mojito I have ever had in my life.  The pasta I had for dinner with some southwestern cream sauce was really good.  I actually enjoyed it.  Everyone elses food looked average to icky.  I think I got  lucky ordering the one tasty dish.  I don't think I would ever go back."}
{"text":"The g/f got a half price $30 certificate through Groupon, so we planned to go Friday after work to take advantage of the happy hour.  The happy hour has 1/2 price all drinks and $5 select appetizers and is from 4pm to 8pm.  We called to make reservations, but the lady on the phone said that there's no need since there is always plenty of room.  This lead me to believe that no one would be there, but when we got there, there was a good amount of people.  We had to wait about 5 minutes to get seated which wasn't a big deal.  

The place was spacious, which was a plus.  We quickly ordered two apps and two drinks.  We had the sliders and calamari for the apps and I had the fleetwood long island while she had the platinum party drink.  The calamari was good, but not great.  The portion could have been about 1/3 bigger for the price.  The sauce it came with was very disappointing since it tasted just like a sweet chili sauce I use with my lumpia that I can by from the store for about $4.  Nothing special.  The sliders were very good, and my only complaint was that the tomato was under ripe. The fries they came with had a either kosher or sea salt on them which made them very tasty.  We also ordered the chicken taquitos from the happy hour menu.  They were pretty good, however I think a side of salsa would have made them better.  

What made the experience special was the customer service that we received.  Apparently our appetizers were taking rather long to get out to us, however we didn't seem to notice.  I honestly feel as though our apps came out in a timely fashion.  The manager who was there came by before our appetizers arrived and apologized for the wait.  We told him that it was no problem.  Completely unprovoked, he then told us that the drinks were on the house.  They were half price already, but still was $12 for the two and we didn't even know that there was a problem.  WOW!  I've never experienced such treatment.  It wasn't until I noticed how quickly another table got their apps after they ordered them that I saw just how quickly they normally bring food out.

The food was slightly average but the price of the food was a bit too high for what we got.  The drinks were very good.  I would have to say if it was not for the customer service, I would likely not have made the 40 minute drive for a second try, but I will likely make another trip out there.    

Also, kids 12 and under eat free on Mondays from 11am to 10pm (with purchase of any full priced entree).  And free bull rides for all kids."}
{"text":"If you like grease and slow service, you'll like this place.  Was really hoping for something different when we arrived but it's typical bar type food you can get anywhere.  Onion rings that tasted like they had been frozen arrived on a bed of tasty french fries but were boredeline cold and greasy. We had to ask for something to dip them in.  My bbq sliders were good but because they had been left on the plate too long, they arrived luke warm with soggy bottoms.  The service could have been better considering the place was nearly empty and lots of staff in sight!"}
{"text":"The food was pretty good. I am vegetarian so my options were limited, but everyone I was with seemed to enjoy their food. The portions were really big. The cocktails were also tasty. 

While the food was decent it was not good enough to get me back there. The service was not the best. Our waitress came by a lot, but perhaps too much. She didn't really read the table to see if it was an appropriate time to check on us. She also pretty much asked us to clear our table, as the second a plate was empty she would pop up and ask us to hand it to her. That kind of service isn't really my thing, as it makes me feel like they are trying to get us in and out as quickly as possible. If you like that much attention then you may like it."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went in last night for happy hour before a movie and they took amazing care of his allergies and great hospitality...service was immediate at the bar and manager approached us three times to check on everything. Our bar tender was Buddy, and he made sure everything was perfect and absolutely exceeded expectations going into our evening here. My boyfriend and I work in a fine dining atmosphere and I hate to say it but I haven't seen anyone go as far as they have to ensure guest satisfaction in a long time. I highly recommend this place!!"}
{"text":"Made reservations for July 29th concert. Picked out my table. Paid for my tickets and ok'd charge for 180.00 bottle service. Get to CR @ 10pm and find my table given away. When I made the reservation there was only one other reservation on the book. Tell me what the point was for mr to drive there and make early reservations only to show up and get a table thats right in front of a speaker. No one else sat next to a speaker. They offered a booth. However I ha mentioned to the girl that 2 of the people in my group were tall and larger so they would be more comfortable at a table.  And whats the deal with no Budwiser beer.  All in all I spent 300.00 by the end of the night and feel ripped off as I didnt get what I paid for. Concert started way late and headliners were cut short as they started one hour before closing time. Not impressed, no management available when I asked to speak to someone. I am not sure why this review did not post the day I wrote it. This is from an event on July 29,2011"}
{"text":"Not a very good place to eat on a budget, plus the food is only ok. I would not come back the food is better at chilis and about the same price. If u want to drink and watch football go to RTOs where u can get big beer mugs like the one in my picture."}
{"text":"Food took forever to cone out and was cold when it did. Nobody ever checked on us and we saw our waitress a whole three times between our food arriving and paying our bill.  Despite the restaurant being empty, the manager never checked on us.  This place obviously is not in business because of the service."}

the Owner Oz is great & take's pride in his establishment... they keep the menu pretty fresh with new items always popping in for the season and they have my favorite local micro-brew - ORANGE BLOSSOM!!!  

Their Happy Hour is the REAL DEAL - Try the Pulled Pork Sandwich while your there

When you're looking for a great spot to watch Football on the weekends this is as good as it gets - Jumbo screens and multiple TV's with multiple bar setups & it's close to Tempe but not directly slammed in all the traffic - which is a plus to me. Great bar to catch a BEARS game at on Sundays and a University of Texas spot on Sat's but I'm Michigan so ya won't find me there :)

For those that need a patio like myself - prepare yourself... its freaking HUGE & looks out across the courtyard. If you're trying to switch it up from the typical Oldtown Weekend and don't want to go as far as Mill It has a pretty decent night life - doubles up as a club / lounge late night on some weekdays & weekends - great DJ's & they even get some pretty decent live entertainment.

Def worth a stop if you're in the area whether its just for a quick drink before a movie or you're having a full meal."}
{"text":"Very typical chain-like restaurant food, it's not my style at all, but everything was okay.  I had the Steak Salad, and my friend had the Flatbread.  The service was excellent, our waitress was very helpful and charming, and the food arrived quickly.  Not a big wine selection, as you might expect, but some okay wines all the same.  This place will do in a pinch."}
{"text":"TOTAL DISAPPOINTMENT:  We called ahead and was told there was a 15 minute wait.  We showed up moments later. An hour later we still had not been seated. When we spoke up, we were told it would be another 40 minutes. Once seated, we waited another 20 minutes. Our waiter had very little time for us. He flew through the motions without sincerity. We experienced further disappointment when the food arrived. The burgers were dry. The flatbread crust was cracker-like. The toppings on the flatbread were lacking and flavorless. The shrimp tacos were slider size, speckled with a few shrimp here and there. They were more like an appetizer or kids meals than a regular meal. We left with both our belly's and wallets empty."}
{"text":"The two young ladies immediately greeted me when I entered the restaurant and directed me to my friends that were already seated.  

Our server, Sonya, was OUTSTANDING.  After reprimanding me for being late (she was just joking), that started the enjoyable service.  Sonya was friendly, funny and professional, especially after we all kept changing our minds. 

After looking at the regular menu, there was a special menu with a roast turkey dinner, since it was a week or so before Thanksgiving. This meal was excellent, with real roasted turkey, stuffing, mashed potatoes, green beans and cranberry sauce (not the jelly kind, but a really tasty one).  The meal could have been hotter, but it was very good and plenty for lunch the next day.  The price was reasonable, 

Having been to the CR several times, I have never had a bad meal, poor service, or a bad experience."}
{"text":"Great Meatloaf and the Fish & Chips with homemade Chips also really good. Pricing is not bad either."}
{"text":"This is a really nice bar and restaurant with a good outdoor patio. The food is hit or miss. Sometimes good and sometimes just ok..."}
{"text":"Bad service, mediocre food.  Wouldn't go out of my way to eat here, but it'll do in a pinch."}
{"text":"I absolutely love the atmosphere, food and service here! The Spinach dip is one of the best ever tasted!!! You cant go wrong dining here. Whenever Im in Pittsburgh, this is my go to spot!!!"}
{"text":"Slow service that doesn't come back often but good food and nice lunch specials!"}
{"text":"Basically the younger brother/sister of Blue Martini that tries desparately to be a cowboy themed club. Haven't tried the food, dance floor is a stage a garage band
couldn't fit on, but they have quality drinks, a friendly staff, and a great happy hour.... So 3 outta 5"}
{"text":"Was not impressed with the food at all.
I ordered the pulled pork sandwich which came out barely warm and with almost no BBQ sauce. I had to ask for more sauce. The bun was so wet, like it had been sitting for a while, that I couldn't even pick up the sandwich. I used a fork. I also ordered the sweet potato tots, which I had to send back because they were mushy.
Lonnie ordered the fish and chips, which he liked, but wasn't impressed. So far no other place match's Four Peaks when it comes to fish and chips.
You really had to search for a reasonable meal, some items were too high for a bar.
Wouldn't eat there, but it has a nice atmosphere for drinking, and large tables for groups meeting up."}
{"text":"Went to the grand opening last night so of course it was popping.  VIP tickets were worthless because the line was still pretty long according to a friend who was texting me updates.  I arrived after the the line died down.

It's a cowboy resturant/bar.  Think of a hip Stoney's.  Yes, they have a mechanical bull too which riders seemed to want to grind last night.  

The menu looked pretty standard for bar food: chops, pulled pork, burgers, etc.  I think all food was priced under $30.  I didn't bother ordering food since it was too busy.   

The bottle service was reasonable with a $200 price on most bottles you'd get at a club.  I only recall the Veuve Clicquot being more at $230.

The outside glass rock fire pits were a nice touch to give it a lounge feel.  There are also a couple areas that could be closed off for single or multi-table parties.

They had a small dance floor inside.  Maybe it was an area where they would normally set up tables.  They played different genres of music which was cool.

I'm sure I'll go there again, although I will not go out of my way for it.  It could possibly be the newest LV local hotspot depending on the weekly events.  Stay tuned."}
{"text":"Went here on for a late night quick bite a couple times in the past year and we always ordered the fish and shrimp tacos. The tortillas can be a little bit dry but other than that it's so good. The shrimp and fish are always perfectly cooked and not dry. Our waitresses and the bartenders are also very nice as well. The price is a little bit high for the quality of the food but other than that we'll definitely return sometimes for some quick-fix tacos craving!"}
{"text":"I've been to Cadillac Ranch, just never this location before. I came for a bachelorette party. The drinks were good.  The drunkeness was a good indicator. haha. We got there around 7pm on a Saturday, and the dinner crowd was on their way out. By the time we left around 9pm, the drinking crowd was there and ready to have a good time. 

I had a beer, a shot, and a DELICIOUS Italian Chicken salad. No complaints whatsoever. 

Before we left, we got the bride-to-be and one of the bridesmaids up on the bull. It was pretty hilarious and we had fun watching (so did the rest of the restaurant). 

I felt that it was a bit overpriced, but I'll definitely go again for a date night with the hubby or a girls night out."}
{"text":"If you like grease then you will love this restaurant.

Cadillac Ranch is your typical yeee-haw, ride 'em cowboy, all-american bar and grill with oversized portions of mediocre food drenched in grease, smothered in cheese and sprinkled with a heaping mess of empty calories. It. Is. Disgusting. My skin is crawling just thinking about it. Please do America a favor and refrain from giving this place any more money than it already has. Please. For your children's sake."}
{"text":"Quite possibly the grossest bathrooms I have ever seen. I've been to truck stops that were cleaner. Sign on door says bathrooms checked and signed by employees every 15 minutes. And the chart was empty."}
{"text":"Yea... been here a Couple Times for LUNCH ... still ISN'T blowing my skirt up.

The Service is mediocre at best... thankfully they serve REALLY BIG glasses of soda and water so that they don't have to attend to them that often.

The Food is .... ok... nothing spectacular... but Not Horrible either.... really Middle of the Road... but in this town... that is not a good thing because there are too many other places (Yard House downstairs) that offer better fare.

Ordered the Chopped Asian Salad... Note... this does not come with lettuce or mixed greens ... just chopped up asian cabbage, red cabbage, peanuts, chicken chunks, wonton strips and red onions... the menu said scallions which are fine by me... but if I knew it was red onions... I would have asked they be skipped as I don't care for red onions.  And the salad dressing... rice wine vinegar... was Too Sweet....  and sugar-y tasting for me.  Oh well... live and learn.

My mom ordered the Pulled Pork Sliders... you get 3 good size sliders that are served with a small side of slaw and french fries.  They 'looked' better than they tasted.  The pork was Dry.... the Bun was old/stale.... and the bottom bun was soggy.  The BBQ sauce was ok... 

The NICE thing... is that if it's not crowded... you can sit on the patio... and that is OH SO LOVELY on a beautiful spring day."}
{"text":"This place is not usually the type of place I visit, but I often go when co-workers are throwing a happy hour. 

I have to say that every time I visit, our group has so much fun. The wait staff seems to give us the right amount of attention and our drinks are always full. Happy hour prices are incredible.. I ordered a vodka water for only $2 and pretzel with fondue for $5. The pretzel was delicious. 

I probably wouldn't choose to go to Cadillac Ranch on my own, but I always have a great time when invited."}
{"text":"Where \"Rock meets Country\" says their website -- umm.. neither rock nor country ever showed up the night we were there - it was all techno and drunks on the dancefloor- ok - we can deal with that -- but we ended up having a truly horrible, rude waitress and terrible drinks to boot. 
we didn't even finish our drinks - I took one sip of my house marg (served in a plastic soda glass) and decided it wasnt worth the 100's of calories of corn syrup..couldnt taste the tequila through the sweet mix so I don't know if it was any good or not.
yech.
what a dive. i think it was once a country bar - then they decided to reinvent themselves -- or tried to. no cowboys here -- or rockers either - just a bitchy waitress and bad drinks."}
{"text":"Cadillac Ranch is an interesting country rock and roll themed restaurant.  With the riding bull in the restaurant and a nice bar area, this place is packed on the weekend evenings.

In terms of the food, their food is fair.  I honestly prefer their appetizers, specifically the kettle chips.  They fry the chips fresh in the restaurant and top it with aged balsamic and bleu cheese.  It's AWESOME.  I honestly only stop by here for that appetizer and a beer.  

Great location for some drunken fun, but the food is only fair.  If you want to eat anything there, do their kettle chip appetizer.  It's big, it's good, and it's filling."}
{"text":"Came here on a Friday night with a few friends and my amazing girlfriend.  I expected it to be a little busy so it's not a big deal.  I was a little disappointed with service at the table as we had to actually flag a barback down and ask him to send a waiter/waitress over to take our drink and food order. I don't fault the girl for it being her first week, she really went above and beyond to try and take care of us. However, when the \"experienced\" girl came on, she was not the friendliest out there. She came by and asked us if we needed any more drinks and left before we could answer. The food was good, just got the chicken fingers, but this is a service industry and I pay for the experience, which just wasn't there."}
{"text":"I went there before Valentines Day with my daughter and it was lovely. The decoration was nice and he staff were friendly. The food delicious and looks good."}
{"text":"Have been here twice for lunch. The food is only fair and overpriced. The service was painfully slow. It is located up some steep stairs and is pretty far from any parking. There is a semi-hidden elevator that is even slower than the service."}
{"text":"Happy Hours at Cadillac Ranch are my favorite. The HUGE outdoor patio is a big draw, so get there early. Happy hours are daily, plus ALL night on Mondays. A BIG plus, is half off all bottles of wines on Wednesdays (umm..hello?)

I usually go for the appetizers and it's not the healthiest - but it's HAPPY HOUR!

Margaritas are tasty - they don't skimp on the tequila!

I'm a fan!"}
{"text":"I'm agreement with Ed M.- the food is OK and service is SUPER inconsistent...AND more on the BAD side!!! The waitresses just pass you by without even offering a water, or asking if you have been helped already. Poor customer service is enough for me to not come back, but I actually have more reasons to share; they don't have the main popular beers on draft like they had before- such as Dos Equis lager. They even ran out of Stella Artois last night! Another reason I'm in no hurry to come back is that there is a horrible, musty, rotten stench that hovers in the area where the patio begins. It smells like a wet mop that has not been rinsed out for weeks. This alone gives the appearance that they are not keeping things sanitary. Thirdly, my girlfriends agree with one of the other Yelpers; the mixed drinks seemed to be watered down! One of my girlfriends also reminded me to add that the bathrooms were filthy with the garbage overflowing! Cadillac Ranch, get your $&@t together! I honestly don't know how you stay open as a business?"}
{"text":"Due to the cheap bottle service and lack of desire to spend NYE on the strip again, we found ourselves here this year.  The concept is the same as all bars with the mechanical bull but I will say the decor was fun.  The ceilings were covered in old license plates, some wall were covered with hub caps, and others were lined with old acoustic guitars.  The bottle service was cheap, the food was greasy (that's all they offered after 10), and fun times were had by all.  Our server was amazing!  He was around so many times that we never had to refill our own drink even though the bottle was sitting at our table, he took shots with us, and was just pleasant all around.  I don't know what its like on a normal day/night, but it was pretty good on NYE."}
{"text":"Always heard the advertisements for this place on the radio. Was given the impression it was a real hip place to go. Well, when you see the outside, the big Cadillac and the entrance with all the license plates, you think you're in for a treat. It's just a facade. Get inside, sit down. You realize they keep the place inside too cold. At least the bathrooms are clean. I ordered the bacon wontons because that was the cheapest thing on the menu ~$8. When I got it, I was shocked by the small portion. You get used to the taste, but when I was done, I felt a little nauceous. Maybe cream cheese and maple syrup isn't the best combination? For your money and time, go elsewhere."}
{"text":"Not bad.  The atmoshpere is great (4 stars) but the food average at best.  We went on Friday night specifically for happy hour got there 10 minutes before it ended by the time they seated us, it was 7:00 and we were told happy hour was over no exceptions.  Heard all about the great nachos only to be turned away because nachos aren't on the regular menu.

Doubt if I'll ever go back.  Many better choices in Town Square anyway."}
{"text":"The food was just terrible. Ranch macaroni was inedible and I had the fish tacos. They were so small I thought it was appetizer. Beer was fine but $35 for our dinner with 2 drinks and small portions was worthless"}
{"text":"Being from Texas and coming to this restaurant made me laugh. I could not quite figure out the whole motif thing. Cadillac bar? With guitars all over the place then pics of Aerosmith and Shania? What was the connection? Was it to be a guitar bar or country bar? Anyway, was there for a business dinner and the food was mediocre.  We had a large group and so we had a buffet type dinner. One of the choices was BBQ Ribs..I think not. The other Texan with me said they were not any good. The meat is supposed to fall off the bone people, not be sawed off by a knife. Glad it was not my money!!"}
{"text":"We were here on Wed., March 6, 2013, a party of 5.  We were seated immediately by friendly staff and placed our drink orders.  We ordered chips and salsa for appetizers and there was plenty for all 5 of us to enjoy.  The order came with 2 salas to try, one fresh tomato, cilantro salsa and one cheesy salsa.  There was a miss communication with our waitress when we ordered another round of drinks that we were ready to order our dinner so someone from our party spoke with someone at the Hostess Station asking that our waitress return to take our orders.  

We mostly all ordered salads, the Steak Salad, the Southwestern Chicken Salad and the Buffalo Chicken Salad and one order of tacos.  As we were being served our entrees the owner, Chris came over with an order of his BBQ Baby Back Ribs, on the house, for our having to wait. They were delicious and his generosity was greatly appreciated.  We all loved our fresh salads with meat .  The tacos were not good and would not be on our list to re order.   Chris tried very hard to make our dining experience pleasurable and we appreciate that.  It was not a busy night so our waitress was lacking in her service to the customer"}
{"text":"I'm writing this review as our party of four currently  sit and wait for our food, for the last 40 minutes. We had to ask for our salads after waiting 40 minutes and only two of the three were brought out and our food is no where in site. Our appetizer was brought out in about 8 minutes with no plates or silverware. Very disappointed, some of the worst service I have ever experienced."}
{"text":"After seeing a movie at the Tempe Marketplace theater (Forgetting Sarah Marshall, which was amazing, by the way) and coming out absolutely ravenous, we stumbled into this place, which was just okay. Pretty expensive, given the atmosphere - all appetizers were in the $7-$8 dollar range, $10.75 for a burger, $7-$8 for dessert. We passed on the appetizers ($8 for onion rings?!) but we both had burgers, which were good (though i ordered mine medium and it came out approaching well), and their fries are great. (The onion rings, however, tasted like funnel cakes. Is there powdered sugar in the batter?) They'll also let you get \"half and half,\" half fries and half onion rings, for $1 extra, though the waiter didn't tell me about the extra dollar at the time. Grr. The beer selection was good - any restaurant that carries Red Stripe wins my love, but they were out of it today, so I went with Pacifico. Mmm. For dessert, I had the cheesecake (completely blah) and my friend had the brownie fudge something, which was enormous and pretty tasty. 

There is a mechanical bull that they will apparently let you ride anytime, and our waiter was very attentive and pretty hot, but in general, this place is just a pretty run-of-the-mill theme bar. If the food were either 20% cheaper or 20% more interesting, I think I'd have a new favorite post-movie hangout. As it stands, I'd rather make the 3 mile drive to Thai Basil."}
{"text":"When Tempe Market place was being put together...I though WOW a swanky place where college kids and laid back adults could get together and enjoy themselves.  Cadillac Ranch was being built...and the hype was hot enough to make you buy a meal ahead of time.  Read the reviews but thought...what they hey lets try it out.  And now I see why it has two stars...should have listened to the other yelpers -_-... went there is Good ole' Rada, thought it would be nice to enjoy the day outside.  Nearly Drowned by the ample amount of misters.  Thought to self...hmm well at least the food should be good.  Ordered the sliders meal... maybe they were scarce on meat, but the slider patties were the size of silver dollars, tasty but small.  Yes the service was slow; my glass was getting refilled faster by the misters than the actual waiter. It gets two stars in my book for the service and the overall experience (for lunch that is). you get what you pay for..and for 11 bucks, a couple barbie sized patties in human size buns, a not so 'AHH' diet coke, and 5 oz of wine (and that's on the 2.00 happy hour deal) ... kind of seems appropriate. 
 I recommend this if you are stuck hanging around Tempe Market place and you have just a few bucks and feel like getting close to full...
and now I think that Tempe Market place took Mill Ave's charm...and they need to step up to compensate killing a once adorned chill out spot for ASU and Tempe.  Shopping is good...we could deff replace CR for perhaps Sakana? Who knows...
Bye for now!"}
{"text":"A mechanical bull! YES, they have one in their bar. For a tip, you'll be able to fancy yourself on the backside of a bull. Delightful!

NOW, on to the food. I didn't care too much for their selection of entrees so we opted to get appetizers.

Sliders were delicious. The crispy onion strings was a nice touch. Get a side of BBQ sauce and it will be bomb diggity.

Sweet n Spicy Calamari was okay. I really liked the sauce but they smothered the calamari with it so the crunchiness was gone. If you're a fan of crunchy, get the sauce on the side. 

Wings were good. THEY WERE HUGE! I looked at them and said DAMN! Again, I like crunchy so guess what I did. I ordered the sauce on the side. As for the taste, well.. they were just normal wings. Nothing special.

The service was good. The waiter made sure to check on us every now and then. 

My only regret: not riding that bull. :o/"}
{"text":"Very so so food coupled with barely competent service. I agree with the other reviewer that gave them 9 months. Why on earth does a casual restaurant have an attendant in the bathroom? So annoying and so out of place. Don't bother with this restaurant."}
{"text":"Ok, so I ended up going here last weekend with some friends to grab a drink before seeing a movie. Everything else was packed and this was the only place we could grab a bar seat at for a quick beer. This experience was much better than the last one. The beer selection was pretty decent and the bartenders were great. Also, it was really entertaining to watch large drunk people ride the mechanical bull, I'm not sure why it was only large drunk people, but that night literally everyone that got onto the bull was. Awesome to watch! 

So I bumping this place up to 3 stars. On a busy weekend night they always seem to have some open seats at the bar or outside on the patio, they have drink specials 7 days a week, and the bartenders were great. And if you are really lucky, the mechanical bull gets used by really drunk large people."}
{"text":"I met some folks there for a happy hour.    My reviews are usually more expansive but it was just hard to get a drink there at the bar.    I don't think I will be back.   This location had a bigger crowd then the one I have visited in Cincinnait.

Service - pretty bad (bartenders) - we had to flag her down several times to get a drink.

Cost - not bad

Food - We just had driniks - but looking at the food reviews - I am glad I did not.   I will just pick it up at the awesome Giant Eagle Market District they have ;-)

I would not waste my time with this place unless you needt the location (note there is Sone Peppers right around the corner / never been but will try)"}
{"text":"I've been to this location a few times and to another several times. Most items are at least average, but nothing is really great, except for maybe the Cadillac Ranch Kettle Chips app, which I LOVE! The burgers are pretty good as well, but not my first choice for a burger with so many other great options in the Burgh.

Yesterday, I tried the Asian Chicken Salad, which was pretty lackluster. It has soggy lettuce and flavorless dressing. The only flavor was imparted by the limited Szechwan peanut sauce and the only enjoyable texture came from the crispy wonton strips. I was going to get the Pittsburgh Steak Salad, but it was a bit too pricey in a land where you can get the same thing at nearly any pizza joint and be at least confident that it will be OK for half the price. The lady got a side of sweet potato tots, which sounded like they were going to be awesome, but they were not crunchy enough and very mushy inside.

Overall, I would say there are some safe bets here, but there are items that will leave you disappointed."}
{"text":"Great late night food, crowd is gangsta."}
{"text":"I went to Cadillac Ranch on Wednesday 5/8/13 with 3 friends. The reason we chose CR Tempe was because they have a great patio overlooking a stage at Tempe Marketplace where the winner of \"the voice\" would be singing that night. We were told it was going to be a 25- 30 min wait for the patio- not a big deal. 45 minutes later the hostess finally takes us to get seated and she tries to put us at a table on the back patio. I asked to speak to the manager (since I told her we came there solely for the good view of the stage and good service) and miraculously we were sat at a front patio table. Our server was actually great- she made sure we were taken care of and was happy we were sat in her section. To be clear-this one star review has nothing to do with her. I ordered the sliders with chipolte ranch, my friend ordered a salad with chipolte ranch, and my other friends shared the tacos. The food was pretty good and the concert was awesome. It wasn't until later that night I found out that something about my food was actually not good.Around 1:30am I woke up with a very upset gargling stomach. It wasn't long after that until I got sick. I was sick all night and only got about 3 hours of sleep. The next morning I felt a little bit better and got ready for work- since I am right out of college, every minute of work counts. I got to work at 8am and at around 9:30am my stomach started acting up and I had to leave work for the whole day. I am losing money on my next paycheck because of Cadillac Ranch. I believe they owe me a day's worth pay. I'm still only able to eat bland foods and now instead of getting together with friends tonight, I get to go home and sleep to get over this. Yay fun weekend for me.. not.  So take it from me- do not go to Cadillac Ranch for food unless you want food poisoning and your weekend to be ruined. I will not be returning anytime soon, if ever."}
{"text":"Never again. 
Waitress needs to leave the bad attitude at the door, pretend that you love your job.  Remember bad service no tip.  Make sure your cook uses fresh bread, I got the moldy one.  One star for you because I am in a good mood."}
{"text":"I took my family here who were visiting from Chicago and we weren't happy with this restaurant at all. As a matter of fact everything about our dining experience here was awful. The food is way too expensive for the amount that you get. The service was terrible. It took an hour for our food to come and it tasted like sh*t. I ordered nachos and they were stale and rock hard with black beans that were cooked so long on top of these 8 round tortilla chips that they crumbled. My brother ordered tacos that he said tasted awful and there were only two tiny soft tacos filled with mostly chopped tomatoes. My nephew ordered steak and shrimp which he said tasted ok, but it came with what we could only guess to be but scalloped potatoes. And let me emphasize this was a guess only. We never did ask what the hell it was because we were disgusted with the food. The beer is way too expensive and was nearly uncarbonated from the tap. The beer tasted like the beer tap hadn't been cleaned for awhile. Needless to say this is my  first and last time I will ever go into this so called establishment. I wouldn't recommend it to even my worst enemy"}
{"text":"The place is very nice inside. We came to eat and left still hungry. The food is nice but the dessert was very small. We ordered the apple pie and the size was very very small. People that ordered miller lite and Jack Daniels where out of luck none in stock. This was a Monday. Come on stock up. The lady behind the bar was busy chatting to the other bartenders and not helping the patrons. I would hate to see what it is like when it is busy."}
{"text":"Ehhh, I think I used to like this place when I was young and before discovering Scottsdale. There was an event last night with a radio station and a R&B singer - we thought it would be a good idea to check it out... and we were wrong. 

The crowd was full of ratchet females and wannabe rappers. The drinks did nothing for my buzz - I think I was drinking pure red bull because there was no taste of vodka. There's a designated dance floor, which is nice, but not when the DJ only plays 2 Chainz. 

Maaaaybe I'm spoiled by Scottsdale nightlife, but I would never come back here."}
{"text":"This review was started a while ago maybe 6 months ago... I forget to send it.

I would have to say this place is just blah. My husband and I went to Tempe Marketplace and decided to get a quick bite here after we shopped for a couple hours. We have been here a few times and its always OK. We almost went to San Felipes (wish we did), but the music was so loud, I wanted to more or less chill out. We got seated right away, I dont think I have ever seen it busy there. Sat in a booth by the bar, across from the server station. The Coyotes game was on, so my husband was happy. We saw the little fliers they had which is happy hour every day from 3-7PM. It was 530 so that was perfect. We ordered 1 Corona and Iced Tea to drink. The waitress stand was literally across from our booth 2 feet, so we sat there watched her get an Iced Tea and sat there waiting for the bartender to talk with some people or friends at the bar forever desperately waiting for the Corona, which would take 1 second to get and pop the top off. She could of turned around walked one step and bring my iced tea, but she didnt. I said to my husband, wow what is the hold up, 5 mins later, she gave me my iced tea, I think she might of heard me..few more mins he slowly brought over the beer. I dont fault her, she was waiting there the whole time and didnt move, as to say hurry up. There was another waitress as well waiting for beers, while he chit chatted away. 
We ordered the Pretzel Fondue for an app, which was different, because it was cream cheese fondue. I thought it would be a good, maybe a nice or different cream cheese, but I think they melted Philly Cream cheese you get at the grocery store ha! The pretzel was literally greasy, I dont know how that's possible and it showed its leftover grease when you would pick it up from the plate. Maybe it was the mass amount of butter put on it. Who knows. They sprinkled parsley on top of the \"fondue\" to spice it up I suppose, didnt make sense.  I ordered the Cadillac Salad with no meat and my husband ordered the Sliders with fries (fries was .99 cents more, for 10 fries) The salad was literally spring leafs, 10 shreds of cheese, 2 grape tomato's sliced in half (totaling 4) and 6 tiny, thin sliced, dried looking cucumbers dried on the outside rim of the salad bowl. (Looks like they put it up and waited for the sliders to get done so dried out salad) The sliders my husband said were ok. Fries were good. I had a couple. The bill comes and it was messed up. Seriously I am done with this place. I will not go back. I try and avoid the whole Tempe Marketplace period."}
{"text":"Hit or Miss. Onion rings were fantastic but were placed on a bed off old and cold onion straws. Chili was not even lukewarm when brought out. Most of the food was tasty.  2 apple spinach salad was drenched in salad dressing.  Waitress did not ask us how our food was.  We received some sort of bar tax and our drinks were sweet tea and cherry coke. They could turn this place around easily with some changes to become 4 star."}
{"text":"This might be okay for young 20-somethings, out to get smashed on $3 Happy Hour beers before heading over to the next mall bar across the parking lot, but it's no good for elderly 30-year-olds, intent on dinner conversation. 

If you're satisfied to eat @ one of the bar tables, you're set, but if you're looking for old fashioned floor level seating, good luck.  After a 2 hour wait (and our party had actually arrived before we joined them), we two stepped over to a restaurant where we could actually sit down.  

And where we could hear each other w/o having to fight some blaring obnoxious pop music.

Can't comment on the food, because we never got any.  Happy hour beers WERE cheap, but $19 for two Happy Hour Absolut and Red Bulls is highway robbery, if you ask me. 

Server was nice enough.  Mildly entertaining watching wasted floozies get flung from the mechanical bull.  Could have done w/o the bloody boxing match on TV.

Wheelchair accessible, but only if you can get one of those aforementioned elusive tables, otherwise you'll be at the perfect height to rest your head on the table while everyone towers above you.

Pretty sure I'm never going back here.  Not really my scene.  Perfect if you want to rev up your man date w/ your bull riding skills before some hot drunken anonymous weekend sex, though."}
{"text":"Not great, but okay food. The food is normally decent, but not great and the service is very hit or miss. You can get great service or you can get the kind of service where you have to beg for silverware and napkins... multiple times... and still  have to ask some random other person who works there to finally get what you need. I definitely do not recommend the Thai salad, but most of the other food I've gotten has been pretty good."}
{"text":"I went here to meet up with some friends on a Friday evening for few drinks and bites. Nice atmosphere inside and out - the interior was nicely designed with western/country theme and of course.. a mechanical bull if you're sober enough or drunk enough to ride one.

We sat outside on the patio - the service was pretty good. Food .. nothing out of the ordinary.

If I am in that area.. I wouldn't mind going back"}
{"text":"This place sucked.  I got the lemon chicken, which tasted like grilled chicken soaked in oil, because that's exactly what it looked like:  Chicken bathing in a layer of grease.  No lemon flavor, what so ever.  I was still able to eat is because 1)  I avoid wasting animal products for the sake of the animal 2) I can dab the oil off.  My friend got this steak that was bunt to a crisp.  He didn't even eat it.  The server didn't even ask how everything was or what was wrong with it.  When your customer orders something and doesn't put a dent in it and doesn't want to wrap it up, something's probably wrong and it would be in the server's best interest to ask.  Nope.  Either he didn't give a hoot and/or he's dumb.

\"Eek!  Me thinks not\" may be a little too harsh.... but I can say in full confidence that I  will not be returning."}
{"text":"Went for happy hour and ended up staying for dinner.  Happy hour drinks were good and well priced.  Food was blah.  Had a flat bread pizza which was the best thing that was ordered by the group.  Real thin crust and crisp.  My fiance had a burger which he ordered medium but came out over cooked and dry.  Fries were blah.  Nothing special about his place."}
{"text":"Went after work, around 6PM on a Wednesday night.  It was busy, but there was no wait for a table.  

Seems like a good spot to go after work for a few drinks and simple meal.  They had a live band which was pretty good.  Service was quick, our waiter stopped by frequently.

I ordered the spicy shrimp tacos.  Very good, though kind of a small portion.  As a table, we shared an order of Cadillac Ranch Chips (I think it's what they are called), which were VERY good.  

When I'm staying in the city, there are plenty of great spots within walking distance.  But if you are staying outside of the city, this is one of the better places I've found.  Will likely go back again."}
{"text":"Great service, good food and cheap drink specials . We have been here twice and have had good experiences both times."}
{"text":"This is the 2nd time I have eaten at this restaurant.... The first being many moons ago when they opened. I hated it then. I HATED it today. The ONLY reason for the 2nd star is because our waitress was really sweet. 

We ordered an appetizer, which was really good (tower of onion rings). I ordered the meatloaf, substituting broccoli for corn. Hubs ordered cowboy cut rib eye, rare. Food comes out. Take a bite and want to spit it out. My meatloaf was DISGUSTING. It was dry. It was over seasoned with some green stuff. There was no BBQ gravy at all. My corn was dry and tasteless. I took maybe 6 bites. It was awful. Husband's steak was cooked Pittsburgh rare..... NOT what he ordered.... He wanted rare. Not charred on the outside, raw on the inside. Served the steak with a dull steak knife. I'm pretty sure the butter knife on the table would have worked better. 

We didn't see a single manager even on the floor.... On a Saturday night.... During dinner. Every corporate restaurant I have ever worked at and dined in, it is required for a manager to go to every single table. Apparently not here though. They really should have came to check on us though because I wasn't about to complain to my server. Being in the industry, I know that it isn't the servers fault the kitchen messed up or made things wrong. I wasn't about to put that on her shoulders. She already had 4 drunk morons sitting across from us and several other tables. 

We will not be back. I promise that. Paid $75 for a meal we really disliked...."}
{"text":"Went for dinner on a Wednesday with a group of 8. The place was fairly empty most of the night, yet it took a full 15 minutes for our server to take a drink order. Once we received those, she didn't come back for another full 20 minutes. I can't remember the last time I had such slow or nonchalant service. The menu is all bar food and rather uncreative. I ordered the Phoenix cheesesteak and was unimpressed. I'd give 2 stars for the food, one for the service, and 3 for the draft beer selection. So it averages out to two. I won't be back if I can help it."}
{"text":"This place is the best place in Tempe town marketplace by far. Good drinks, good food, and great service. They have a great happy hour and you get 25% your lunch just for checking in. Not to mention the sight of old cougs riding the bull at night is worth the trip itself.

Bars are a dime a dozen in these parts so if you want the best experiencing possible go ask for Mel and Chelsea behind the bar. These master mixologists are heavy on service and even heavier on your pour!"}
{"text":"I met some friends last night at Cadillac Ranch and this was my first time going. The space has a very odd layout, but there are two bars (one inside and one outside on the patio) and both have plenty of TVs to watch. There is also a very cliche mechanical bull, but unfortunately (or maybe fortunately) no one rode it while I was there.

Service at the bar was really good, but when our group moved to a table, service became spotty. We had two servers for our table of 11 and one would take a drink order or would be asked for something and then not deliver it or something would get missed...the two servers just didn't coordinate very well. Luckily we weren't in a hurry and were a pretty laid back group. I only ate the Cadillac salad (mixed greens, tomatoes, cheese and croutons) and it was a nice size for $7.95. However, and maybe this is just a pet peeve of mine, but I hate when restaurants put the dressing on for you! I prefer for it to come on the side, as it does in almost every single restaurant I have ever been to, so I can put on as much as I would like. I did try a few of my friend's fries and they were good...not oily and for fries, they were actually pretty light. As a note, for groups, they put an automatic 20% gratuity on the bill, not the standard 18% most other places do.

Overall, I wouldn't recommend this place as a lunch or dinner destination as I was not impressed by the menu or the entree prices which seemed on the high side for what they were. However the three stars I am giving Cadillac Ranch are for their happy hour:

$2 domestics
$3 imports
$3 Fat Tire bottles
$3 Flavored Smirnoff Vodka drinks
$3 Margaritas
$4 Rum (Captain Morgan)
$5 Vodka Martinis
$3.50 to $5ish select appetizers (there are about four or five)

I'm always happy when I can get Stella drafts for cheap. Also, according to the bartender, one of the margaritas they serve can only be purchased a maximum of 4 times by one person because it is so strong. One piece of advice: If you start at the bar and move to a table, close your tab at the bar even if they offer to transfer it to your table. We had a huge mess last night and some people overpaid and some of us underpaid."}
{"text":"This is typically a place I try to avoid because it's in a commercial district. On the particular night I came here I was two sheets to the wind having had a few at The Thirsty Lion. 

It was a late Tuesday night so it was not very crowded and they had live guitar music so I wound up having a good time. The outdoor area is a nice place to sit overlooking Tempe Marketplace below. The service was OK, not bad but not particularly memorable.

I think this would be an OK place to come during the week. I don't think i would deliberately come here but would have no problem winding up here on a week night when I'm already buzzed. I think I would be miserable here on a Friday or Saturday night when it's crowded.

All I know is that by the time I left I was wasted and felt awful the next morning so they did something right."}
{"text":"Never go here again.  Out of the item I ordered. Substituted without asking!  Would not have discounted my meal or told me of yhe substitution unless I asked."}
{"text":"Food was tastefully average but service not worth the money. Server was inattentive and this wasn't the first time I've had this experience. I haven't been here in over a year so decided to give it a go and same average at best experience. Good place for drinks during warm months on the outside patio but other than that, I'd opt elsewhere."}
{"text":"I have worked as a bartender to support myself through both undergrad and graduate school, so, I am a forgiving and patient customer.... That being said, I give poor reviews rarely&only when I feel this will help save someone from a bad&unnecessary experience. 

I came here for a drink after seeing a movie and was happy to see such an array of beers on tap! (Plus! Yay. Aka the reason for any stars) soon, I'd find out that my bartender would rather care for the group of attractive women that came in, (sparingly/he had time to come back to me before the next one walked in), instead of filling my empty mug. After the delay, I passed on getting another beer for time constraints and it took another 10 mins or so to get my check! Just asinine. Extremely disappointed and won't be returning."}
{"text":"Came here for the bar.  It was eh.  The bartenders are ok.  This is a restaurant with a bar so the place is enormous.  I was here with twenty people but it definitely did not feel like it.  It wasn't very cozy.  They also stop serving the dinner menu after 10 PM.  Only appetizers.

The novelty for this place is the mechanical bull.  Please note: ladies no one wants to see the toosh floss and guys don't give your bro a congratulatory hug after a go on the bull."}
{"text":"Had a work summer party here. Was a fun place to have it at because of the mechanical bull. The food wasn't too bad. Got some chips with dip and a pretzel with dip. The pretzel was FANTASTIC! Chips were ok.

I do remember coming here once a couple of years ago and looking at the prices thinking it wasn't worth it. Seems too pricey for dinner and I think there would be lots of loud, annoying people there when it was busy. BUT that's just not my style. Could see this being a fun place for another type of person.

The staff seemed nice and the location is cool being in Tempe Marketplace. Not sure I'd come back without reason, but wasn't bad for a big group."}
{"text":"Everything about this place screams mediocrity. 
The biggest knock, is that it is a bit overpriced. The biggest upside, is that the staff is always friendly. If you come here, prepare yourself for a typical Chain experience."}
{"text":"good bar scene and has bands. food is okay."}
{"text":"Two words:

Electronic Bull.


Yee haw."}
{"text":"Zuchinni fries were a hit, the avocado egg rolls tasted more like beans and corn then avocado. Not to mention it took a while for them to serve the appetizer. The band practicing during our meal was honestly the best part. The people at the front were a little sad faced when we first arrived. It was a 2 star visit because of the band but then the food came out :( sorry cadillac its a 1 for me and the wife. You know its bad when I don't finish my meal. I don't think ill be going back. Man I really wanted to like this place because its located right next to the theatre."}
{"text":"Went there last Wednesday night and was expecting a nice dinner. There were 6 in our party and only 1 said that dinner was OK. I ordered a NY Strip Medium-Rare and couldn't wait. Well it was more Medium and you could tell it was put on the grill frozen because it was so grainy. Would never go again."}
{"text":"Very mediocre and extremely rude service! Waitress only came over to our table to take our orders, and once after that to refill our drinks and to check how our entrees were. When we ordered drinks prior to the meal, my friend who is 21 ordered a beer while I ordered a water since I'm under 21, when we did this she rudely informed us that she couldn't serve him alcohol because I was under 21 and she said it was \"dram shop\" law. She stated that we needed to google the law, which we did and it stated that bars are not allowed to serve alcohol to customers who appear intoxicated. When she brought us the check right after the meal she did not even thank us. I also heard other tables surrounding us complaining about how rude she was. 

As for the food, it was decent and large portions but still not worth it for the price. Ambience was nice as we sat out on the patio, but still don't think I'll go back!"}
{"text":"We decided to eat an early dinner at The Cadillac Ranch on a Saturday. Our raised booth allowed us to see across the dinning area and bar which are nicely decorated. However, the divider was dusty and a dip tin was left from whomever previously been sitting there. And I was not happy about hearing the entire conversation of our neighbors despite my efforts to focus. The architect/designer probably should consider adding taller dividers. 

Our server was capable.. Not particularly friendly but we had no true issues.

As for the food, I ordered a side salad which was large. While nothing special, it was good. Unfortunately, the tomatoes were off tasting and I had to eat around them. For an entre I ordered the meatloaf. If not for the thin barbacue sauce, the meat would have been flavorless. Meanwhile, the broccoli was cooked well (no one likes rubbery veggies) and the whipped mashed potatoes were delicious but could have been warmer. 

We would probably try other places before returning, but I would not say no to giving them and another dish a second chance."}
{"text":"We popped in here after not getting service for 10-15 minutes at Blue Martini.  

It was my wife's birthday and we were killing time before our reservations at Texas De Brazil.  After being snobbed outta Blue Martini (soon to yelp that experience) we hit up Cadillac Ranch on the way back.  The sign out front said Happy Hour 4-8.  Not only a LATE HH, but everything was %50 off for apps and drinks.

We got in there about 545 and had 45 min to kill.  My wife was having a great time that day telling everyone it was her birthday.  When we got in there she mentioned it to a gentleman who appeared to be the manager.  On the same hand, he greeted us and told us how everything worked.  VERY VERY friendly guy that was really cool.  He told the bartender that she had to take a shot with my wife and I for her birthday and it was up to my wife to take whatever shot she wanted.  THAT WAS PRETTY COOL.  Can't even find that hospitality in Oregon.

We had some type of a pear martini drink (i didn't realize it was gonna come in a martini glass....i felt a lil Fem....haha) then I decided lets go with a Long island!!  The bartender had her own way of making it without using coke or tripple sec, it was something else and some liqueur....Completely pink....and it was @#%%^#$@*&# awesome. We didn't order food being that we had reservations, but seen plenty come out.  The portions all looked rather larger than what you may normally expect.

Next time we come to Vegas we wanna have HH here again, it was cheap and worth the money in our book!!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for an early dinner with my girlfriend after shopping in Pittsburgh. Atmosphere was nice. Anywhere you sat, you were able to catch the game on one of the many TVs. We had the chili nachos for an app(which I highly recommend). The only reason I am leaving 4 stars is because the two of us had burgers cooked medium. Her's was an actual medium and mine was well done. Other than that everything was great. I would return a second time if I were in the area."}
{"text":"If you want an adventure for dinner this is your place. We called to ask if they take reservations, we were told no. When we arrived we found that they do take reservations.. We arrived at 6:10pm and were seated a 7:35pm. Seated only to notice many open tables. Our food arrived at 8:45pm..  You would think after 2 1/2 hours the food would be good. It sucked.. The pulled pork was cold but the BBQ sauce was microwave hot.. We all ordered sweet potato fries and were treated to sweet potato tater tots, they suck too..The experience lasted 3 hours and 15 minutes, it will be our last.. L"}
{"text":"We thought this was a party place, sadly we were mistaking, or we was ther at the wrong time or day. We went to Cadillac Ranch for dinner on a Thursday evening and it was dead.  The bull was broken it only swings it don't buck, but it still will cost you 4 bucks for a ride. Now that was the only down side to the experience. 

The food however was very delish! I had an avocado egg roll that was very yummy and ordered a burger. Friends had the steak and that too looked delish.  

I would go back and hopefully it would be more packed and the party place I was hoping it to be LOL"}
{"text":"Nice place to lounge n listen to music...real awesome islander group played when i was there...they were amazing!

They're prolly the only reason why I would go back..."}
{"text":"We were there for drinks and hanging out. There is a $5 cover charge for men. Got there noticed 3 different bar stations, 1 dance floor, 1 bull ride area, and outside patio. The music was a weird mix (hip hop, pop, rock n roll, with a mix of country). It is OK. The crowd was a mix of 20 to 30s, and drop in a few 40s+. Drinks were expensive!"}
{"text":"Actual date of visit:  3/6/11

Wow...I wish I had read the other reviews before going to this place. It was our first time to Tempe Marketplace and the Cadillac Ranch looked like a cool place to grab a couple drinks and some appetizers. We sat outside in the sun....and that was the only good part. The first 3 beers my boyfriend tried to order off of their beer list, we were told by our indifferent waitress, that they no longer carried them. My margarita's were weak. When our waitress came to take our order my boyfriend asked \"what's really good...what do people just love?\" She shrugged, looked really confused, and said \"well, everyone likes different things so I don't want to recommend anything cuz you might not like it\". He asks that question every single time we go to a new restaurant and he's always got great recommendations. So we decide to start with an order of nachos. 7 above average sized, greasy, round tortilla chips with melted cheese, a few black beans sprinkled on along with some chilis and tomatoes maybe...for $7.99. The sour cream and guac cost an extra $1.50. At this point we still have no napkins or silverware. When we finish the tiny portion of nachos, we order the fried ravioli...which we're told a few minutes later that they're all out. So, we just ask for the check, which I promptly put my Discover card in and give back to the waitress. 2 minutes later she brings it back because they don't take Discover. Why doesn't that surprise me?"}
{"text":"Well I can't rate the food here, but I came here friday night and had a blast.  I will be back with pants next time to conquer that bull!

Town Square is a new outdoor mall.  We came here after learning that Blue Martini had a 20.00 cover.  Just didn't feel like living it up that way that night.  So we wandered over to Cadillac Ranch.  Bartenders were cool and we never had to wait long.  Its a spacious venue with tons of tvs and even a dance floor with some pretty bangin DJs.  We were pumped.  

It was clean and had cute western decor.  My friend and I wandered off from the men and watched the bull riders for a while.  Its 3.00 a ride and the same people kept getting on.  A couple of drunk dudes felt they had to abuse the bull after falling, so the girl at the controls would whip the bull around really hard on purpose.  It was laughs.  

There is a nice outdoor patio and it wasn't hot inside.  The crowd was very mixed and generally good looking.  A great alternative when you don't wanna go all out on the strip.  No cover!"}
{"text":"The only reason I would possibly visit this place again is for the mechanical bull and drinks.

Other than that, the service was a-ight.  The male bartender paid not mind to the thirsty customers at the bar as he schmoozed with his gal-friends as the female bartenders did all the work.  Who's managing this place?

Drinks were good - but who messes up mixed drinks and beer.  

Dessert for cherry cobbler (with not so much cobbler and nothing but pie filling) gets a thumbs down.  

Bull riding - We arrived some time after 7pm and asked the gab-alot-boy bartender about the bull ride.  He stated it would happen at 9pm.  After 9pm gab-alot it still gabbing...then we find out from him the mechanical bull is down.  Now, that's bull!

Like I said, I will come back for possibly drinks and the bull ride, but other than that this is a forgettable place where I would rather not spend a dime."}
{"text":"ive heard tons of negative things about this place.
but i actually really liked it.
if you go wednesday night, they have happy hour! half price drinks!
which are really good by the way. =)

their asian salad was SUPER good as well as their pulled pork sandwiches, porkchops, margherita flat bread, chocolate cake and cheesecake.
(i had a 50 dollar gift certificate, so we ate a LOT!)

the prices were ok.
gets expensive fast!
the service was excellent, SERVER wise.
the hostesses were absolutely terrible."}
{"text":"We called to find out if the outside patio was open and we were told yes. When we got there, we were told the patio WAS NOT open, but we could order from the bar and take our food outside, which is what we did. We had the pork chops which were excellent. The rating would be higher but the miscommunication lowered the rating."}
{"text":"I'm reviwing first the restaurant.  3 STARS
I came to Vegas for a business trip and had to find a place to eat and catch up with an old friend/colleague.  Another restaurant was packed and we decided to come here.  My friend had never been here and being a visitor, neither had I.  We were seated pretty quickly, as we walked past a mechanical bull (interesting).  

My friend ordered the crab cakes and I ordered the shrimp pasta.  I wasn't in the mood for steak because my company had been feeding me like a king previously.  We both liked what we ordered and the bill was about $48 with tax and tip.  The waitresses were pretty good looking and even gave me some great recommendations for some hip-hop clubs.  They told me that the Cadillac Ranch turned into a night club after hours, so I came back to see what was poppin.

Now, I''m reviewing it as a club.   3 STARS
First of all, you can't beat the entrace fee of only $10 for out of state and $5 for the locals.  The music was pretty good for the most part and the crowd was mixed with both young and older folks.  There weren't that many good looking women but I wasn't there for that.  I just wanted to listen to some good music and people watch.  I give it 3 stars.  If you want better music and a better venue, I would recommend the Crown Night Club in the Rio."}
{"text":"I wasn't here long, but the drinks were good and the bartenders are HOTT.  I thought it was cool that they have dancers and a mechanical bull (even though it wasn't running).  The balcony overlooks the marketplace which is pretty cool.  Would love to come back and spend more time."}
{"text":"If it weren't for their happy hour, I would say this place is like any other chain.  But it does deserve a 3 stars for those happy hour specials.  I mean...$2.50 for a premium well drink?  I pay $7 in NYC for happy hour.  For that, it's completely worth it.

Otherwise, the food is quite plain.  The sliders were the only thing that did stick out of all appetizers.  But then again, what can you expect from a chain?  I suppose with enough booze, everything looks good!"}
{"text":"Good food! BBQ pulled pork sandwich was yummy, so was the wedge salad. Surprised it was so empty on a Sunday eve, but looked to be a fun bar for late night."}
{"text":"Horrible I have been here four times because my grandchildren like to ride the bull.  The wait is impossible.  We have waited as long as an hour for the food.  The noise is deafening even for a bar and it is always cold inside.  They never have half the items on the menu, even alcohol.  This is it I am not going back."}
{"text":"Located in the very popular Tempe Marketplace, this is a fun spot to get together after work.  The office has celebrated a couple of birthdays and a few going away parties here.  It's always in the top 3 choices for the young-ins in the office when they get to pick a place for their special day.  There's plenty of space here to accommodate large or small groups.  Our get togethers are normally in the 20-30 people range and we've never had any issues with service.

The appetizers are good here.  Potato Skins and Nachos are the two that I've sampled.  I've only had appetizers and drinks here, so I can't speak about the entrees.

I hear it's awesome on the weekends, but that's for a much younger crowd and I outgrew that scene many moons ago.

Return Factor - 80%"}
{"text":"On Sunday I brought my family to the Cadillac Ranch for a dinner after a movie. The weather was nice and we had hoped to sit outside. When we asked the Hostess if we could sit outside she said the patio was closed.

We were then seated at a table next to a column. Our waiter was prompt and took our drink orders OK. When the drinks were delivered my wife's drink spilled a little. At that time we had no napkins or flatware. I got up and retrieved them from a nearby empty booth. The food was average and overpriced. We then had two people form the waitstaff checking on us and both were there when we were presented with the bill. It felt like they were confused about whose table we were at. The whole experience was disconcerting. I would not recommend this place for a dinner."}
{"text":"After a really crappy visit to Cadillac Ranch a couple of weeks ago, I stopped by here to watch a college football game with some Alumni friends this past Saturday.  Because they chose this place, I didn't have a say in where to go....but decided to give it another shot.

The experience was a 180 degree change from the last one.  Even though it wasn't Happy Hour, the server had Happy Hour menus out.....which is great because the items on the HH menu are not on the regular menu....I don't care if I have to pay full price.

I ordered the Jalapeno Poppers and based on the recommendation from the server, I had a Lagunitas IPA to wash it down.  The food came out pretty fast and was very tasty.  The Breading on the Jalapenos were very light....not the heavy stuff you find on most Poppers.  The Peppers varied from being really Spicy to Mild.....which happens often with Jalapenos.  The ones that were Spicy were REALLY Spicy!  But I like that...so +1 there.  I didn't care for the Cheese filling though...which was a Cheddar blend of some kind....I prefer Cream Cheese filling.

The Lagunitas IPA was very tasty....you could taste the Hops, but it didn't overwhelm the flavor.  It was a mellow IPA in my book.  The server made sure my glass was never empty during the game.

Will I return?  While I don't prefer this place, it's the official spot to watch games for our Alumni Club, so I'll be back soon I'm sure."}
{"text":"My friend and I had gone to AZ this past weekend for Spring Training to see the Angels play.  After their game we went on a mission to find a place for dinner (yes it was early, we had waken up at 415 am to drive down there and had barely eaten so naturally we were starving by 5pm).  She wanted to get a little bit of shopping in as well so I looked it up and found Cadillac Ranch in Tempe Marketplace.  Since it was still kinda early we were seated immediately.  The place looks really cool I dig.  Our waitress was super nice and quick she gave us waters immediately before taking our order.

I got the pork tacos and my friend got Buffalo Chicken strips as an entree.  The food came out pretty quick so that was a plus for our ravenous tummies.  My tacos were pretty legit.  It came with a side of chips and salsa; the salsa I'll pass on (tasted like Pace bottled salsa) but the chips weren't bad.  My friend's buffalo strips were hands down some of the best buffalo chicken I have ever tried. I don't know what they did but it was the most tender melt-in-your-mouth chicken.  I almost wished I had ordered that instead.

Our bill came out to $17something in the end for 2 entrees and 1 soda so that was also pretty awesome. Thus why it deserves the 4 stars."}
{"text":"It's okay to come here with friends and chill out for a little while, not an all night bar for me"}
{"text":"There's a lot of haters here.  I actually enjoy the Cadillac Ranch.  No, I don't go here for the line dancing or bull riding.  Sure it has a country theme, but you know what?  It also has a great bar and LOTS 'o TVs to watch the game of your choice.  We went here to watch the BCS championship this week and had a great time.  The food was decent only (-1 star).  They were very busy and the service was great!"}
{"text":"I went there this last Monday for happy hour and dinner:  
Most of my experience was positive....until the end. We did have a few small service issues, most of which are typical of a fairly new staff in training.  However, we did have a big problem regarding our bill at the end.

During our meal on 8/31/2009 (dinner time), the manager came by and asked how everything was going, we let him know that it was great but to please send by our waitress as we hadn't seen her in awhile.
 
When we received our bill, we were pleasantly surprised to see a few items comped to a 0 dollar charge.  I grabbed my card and gave it to the waitress to pay the tab of approximately $14.50. I was quite surprised when she returned the card and receipt (which had now been charged to my card) for more than $36.00 without even mentioning it to us.  She had also removed the original receipt and put a new one for the correct amount.

I asked to see the manager, who came buy to discuss this with us.  Here is a quick breakdown of the conversation:

Question from manager: Did we eat the items?

Answer from me: Of course we did...the issue wasn't that we were paying for them, it is that your staff substituted the receipt for a different one, charged us more than double what I authorized, and didn't notify us.  How can you do this without at least letting us know that you changed the amount?

Answer from manager: Well I am hearing a different story from her...she indicates that she told you.  Plus we have already given you a good break on the prices of your drinks.

Response from me: First off,  don't take it from me....ask the 3 other people at the table.   Secondly, it was happy hour...these were your advertised prices.  How is it that you gave me a \"break\" on your prices?

Response from the manager: Look, what is it that you want from me?  You ate the food, it was a computer mistake....can I have your business card?

Response from me: My business card, what does my job have to do with this?

Answer from manager:  It looks like you just left from working in a restaurant by the way you are dressed?  

At this point...I signed the receipt and left.  Zero tip of course (sorry to be an jerk...but I was not happy.)

To be honest, I don't remember ever being more frustrated with someone before.  I really wasn't expecting a free ride or meal, but an apology and explanation of HOW you can replace the original receipt with a new one for more than twice the original amount and charge it would have sufficed."}
{"text":"Went to dinner. Nothing special. Got a burger. Pretty bland. Service was friendly. Sister had a beer and said was skunky."}
{"text":"Decided to come here for a drink with some girlfriends after seeing a movie. Big mistake. 

So we have the unfortunate luck of picking this place on a Sat night when it turns into a dance club. You would think we were trying to get into the most exclusive club on the west coast by the way the bouncers hassled us at the door. In AZ, the driver's licenses don't expire for like 60 years or something and the bouncers made my friend get a second form of id because her driver's license was issued in the 90's and didn't have some hologram on it. Totally ridiculous. Then they wouldn't let us take our movie cups in even though we had emptied them out and threw the lids away. And the hostess was just flat out mean.

Finally after the hassle at the door, we walk in and the place is totally dead. What a joke! All that hassle and there's no one even there? You would think the owners would have promoters on the street begging pretty girls to come, but apparently they are going with the a**hole approach.

Finally, we get to the bar and order drinks. Bartenders were jerks. In fact, it seemed like the better looking the woman was, the worse service they got. Like they had something to prove. It was such a turn off. My friend was trying to make some friendly small talk with one of them and he snapped back \"Don't think you're getting any free drinks from me lady\" then walked away. So rude.

The bathroom was absolutely filthy yet, they had a bathroom attendant in there, which made absolutely no sense to me. I felt bad for the lady. It's not the type of place with clientele who are going to leave a tip for a bathroom attendant, plus having to sit in there all night in that disgusting place. Let the attendant go and hire a janitor!

Clearly the owners are delusional and think this place is The Mint when it's ghetto trash. Will not return."}
{"text":"Food was absolutely horrible! Just horrible!  I cant believe they serve food like that! They should be ashamed of themselves!"}
{"text":"The review solely is from happy hour visit after work... one of the better chain happy hours I've ever been to. 5-7pm; $1 off select drafts, $2 off wines and certain cocktails. The food happy hour menu includes $3, $4, and $5 level options and they all seemed awesome (wings, nachos, flatbread pizza). Everything seemed incredibly worth the money and the dead were awesome for happy hour. It did however take a bit of time (maybe because it was packed the day I went after work) but otherwise it was an awesome HH experience and I definitely would return to Cadillac Ranch... especially for those delicious nachos and pretzels sticks! I can't speak to the rest of the menu at all but the place seemed crowded and everyone seemed to be enjoying themselves so I'm sure the sit down dinner was also a great deal."}
{"text":"We love coming here when we're in Robinson. The service is always great, the food is good, and the drinks are on point. Today we ordered the pretzels which never fail to please with their soft, buttery taste, and the edamame was delicious! The boneless wings, however, were extremely dry. We were surprised! This won't deter us from coming again, and our waitress,Stephanie, was attentive, friendly and super efficient!"}
{"text":"As I entered the hostess was reviewing photos with a male companion and said \"oh hi\" and nothing more.  They have a paltry selection of beers on tap (Bud, Bud Light, Coors Light, etc).  Happy Hour is 4-7, which I missed by an hour.  Ordered the sampler and the portions were minimal for the price ($14).  The \"ravioli\" was simply a square (dry) cheese stick, the steak skewer (also dry) was cold, and the southwest egg rolls were hit or miss, as some of them were mostly wrap, while others had adequate filling.  The chicken and the dipping sauces (buffalo, ranch, and southwest ranch) were the highlight.  Our sever added a star to Cadillac Ranch overall, as the Margaritas were more disappointing than the Sampler Platter"}
{"text":"Kids macaroni is out of a box and burnt.  Don't waste your money. When I brought it up to the waitress she argued with me that this is actually what parents prefer and I should have known that is what I would be getting. My child was disgusted by the whole thing. He has better taste and manners than this."}
{"text":"Cadillac Ranch looked really awesome from the outside, this nice red cadillac out front, nice patio outside, and an enclosed bar and grill patio on the side. Upon entering it was pretty dead, well, it was a Monday afternoon after all.

I ordered the Southwestern Country Fried Steak, huge plate of food that came with your choice of House Salad or Ceaser Salad. I dove into the mashed potatos, which upon their many options of how you want your potatos to taste (garlic, cheese, horshradish, etc), I picked garlic - always go safe at a first time resturaunt! The gravy was very bland, I ended up putting more salt on it. The potatos were the only thing salty and flavored on my plate. They had also put diced garlic in the mix, not roasted, but raw garlic. I love garlic, but I can't eat whole cloves (horrible headaches) like some of those awesome people can out there, so it was kinda a downer there. The two pieces of country fried steak was actually steak, but the very fatty piece of steak that you should never buy, cook, and serve.

Since I came with friends and family, it seemed the only thing they could put flavor in was the deep fried dishes. My mother ordered the Fish and Chips, they were slightly on the dark side, the fish wasn't fishy but slightly bland, the cocktail sauce was the only thing that saved the fish from being totally neglected lol. The fries were really good though! My friend had ordered the same thing, I think she wasn't complaining was because she had ordered mamosa's lol.

Service-wise, it was slow, but don't expect to be waited on asap on a dead Monday.

I think the only thing that tasted good was the Ice Cream Fudge Brownie, but that single dish alone won't help this review get to two stars.

All in all, eat at the other different eateries at Tempe Marketplace, I think Cadillac Ranch would be the last resort place if you can't get in to another popular resturaunt at the time."}
{"text":"Food is okay, but service is way too inconsistent. Service ranges from average to well below average and there is no rhyme or reason for the inconsistency. However, I love the Tuesday night music, so I am reluctant to say I won't return, but the service here definitely gives me little reason to."}
{"text":"I have been to Cadillac Ranch a dozen or so times in the past year and a half, generally service is slow, and food is a little overpriced for the atmosphere they have (a bull ride) but generally I have had a pleasant time. However, On 26 Jan 2011, I went to CR with two others for drinks and food, it was about 8:30, and there were only about 20 customers in the store, 2 bartenders at main bar, 1 cleaning patio bar and at least 4 waitresses. We had good service, until a group of about 15 customers came in, we got our appetizers, ordered one more beer and did not see our waitress for 20 minutes. I found her at the bar, and said it had been a long time, and could we add another beer, she said she was terribly sorry, she just got sat with 15 ppl, way across the restaurant (the 15top was by the bathroom, we were behind the hostess stand bar side) I said she has been great, but obviously the mgr isn't so great since he does not know how to cut up a floor for service. 1 beer came 5 minutes later, and so did the 'Vietnamese catfish fish and chips' they were undercooked, and went back. a guy came over and said 'got the beers to ya' and 'any other problems?' we said all is fine now. He then said 'i don't appreciate it when my waitresses come up to me and say customers are calling me a tool'. I explained our problem, he kept berating a laboring the subject, including 'where else would i put 15 people' (the place was empty, even after the 15top, there were no more than 40 people in there; 'i have to have people help all customers' and 'in the restaurant industry when it is not busy, i have to cut people' and 'if you would have brought your complaint to me, i could help you' he had no clothing on that indicated he was a manager. He said that he'd almost rather ask us to leave instead of us 'badmouthing' him. He went to kitchen, we decided we would leave, told our waitress to cancel the redo on the fish, and get our bill. The fish comes out, we told the runner that it was canceled, our waitress brings our bill, the fish is on it, we tell her to take it off, she goes to find the mgr, Doug is his name, to take off food. He then storms to the table slaps the bill down and says \"pay this then leave\". we paid, I asked him for his last name he said \"you don't need it\" and I asked for the bill he did not reply.
This is the WORST experience I have had in a restaurant in a long time. This guy Doug had no right to get up in our faces, period.

We proceeded across the way to San Filipes and brought about 6 more people that were walking up the stairs to go to CR and had a great time."}
{"text":"Been coming to Cadillac Ranch for a few years now so I guess it's about time I wrote review. Had dinner tonight and it was ok. I had the Cajun pasta. My wife and father in law both had BBQ chicken salad. Everyone thought the meals tasted fine.

The restaurant itself wasn't too busy so the service was quick and efficient. It's definitely calmed down since it first opened. That's not a bad thing, just makes it not as exciting. Anyways, three stars it is."}
{"text":"Typical 'burbs establishment and honestly it works in this setting.  Ya it's like a teenage kid in terms of having an identity crisis - cowboy-ish with a middle-class casual restaurant feel (think Applebee's, Fridays, Max & Erma's), a bit sports bar-ish with their tvs on the walls and then let's throw in a club in to this mix and there you have Cadillac Ranch.  

I can't comment to the food as I've never ordered anything off the menu except for drinks.  Drinks were decent and service was ok.  If there were several other options in the area to go out to then I'd likely bypass CR but there's not, so this will have to do when you're out and about in this plaza area."}
{"text":"I was really excited to check this place out by I was sorely disappointed with the service. Being someone who has worked in the service indstry, I get really annoyed when I am not acknowledged and have to wait throughout the night like I did a cadillace ranch. Slow service and average food add up to 2 stars."}
{"text":"\"Overpriced and adequate\" said the husband.  

They didn't have the food I ordered, so I settled on the Cadillac burger with all the fixins.  But cheese is extra and wasn't melted. And by \"fixins\" they mean one leaf of lettuce that was dehydrated and a couple of red onion rings (tomato was missing probably due to the scare going on at the moment).  The burger itself was cooked the way I like it, but it was over-salted.  The fries were battered with a completely flavorless coating that was orange but not at all seasoned.

The husbands steak was chewier than to be expected for the cut and his potatoes were undercooked.

The service was incredibly slow, but the waitress was nice enough to take off the drink that we had to send back for being too sweet.

2 meals, 3 drinks, 1 dessert - $76

I could have gone to a much better restaurant for those prices.  I feel kinda hosed, but I shouldn't be surprised about it because it is still mall food."}
{"text":"I was torn about trying the place due to some of the reviews, but they did not disappoint. Good service and the sirloin was cooked perfect. One of the better steaks I have had dining out."}
{"text":"UPDATE:  Woke up with gastrointestinal discomfort and a sick feeling the morning after my meal at this place.  I have adjusted my rating accordingly.  Horribly mismanaged restaurant.  Bottom line.  The food was actually pretty decent, when it finally arrived.  That's the only reason that this review gets two stars.  (UPDATED to 1 star after waking up sick from the meal.)  The wait staff was a mixture of new people, like our server Zack, who was eager to please and facing impossible odds, and bad attitude people, like the young woman who ignored us and when stopped by our party, told us that we would be served by another person whom she would tell to come visit our table. (She never bothered to tell him, and we stopped him ourselves after waiting over 20 minutes.)  And then there was the manager, Anna, who didn't look or act like a manager, and who actually argued with us about our food and who made admonishing remarks to us when questioned about the food.  

The place wasn't really all that busy, but the bar took forever to get our drinks ready.  Refills were even slower, or we most certainly would have had more drinks and created a larger tab.  We waited a very long time for our food to come out of the kitchen, and several times while we were waiting, other crew members whom we had not previously met came outside and asked us (and every other table around us) if the food they were carrying was for us.  This happened over and over again.  Apparently, even though there were only seven tables in the outdoor dining area, there is no system in place to tell the servers which table to take the food to.  

We felt sorry for our waiter.  He was a very conscientious young man who was put in a bad situation.  Three of the four meals were good.  One was simply bad and didn't meet the description on the menu.  The manager (Anna) made some terribly lame excuse about the meal that was not even remotely close to the description on the menu, and actually insulted the person who was unhappy with the food.  The waiter took that poorly prepared meal back and replaced it with another selection that did more closely resemble the description in the menu, and everybody was content until the visit from the manager, who was defensive, argumentive, and seemingly unknowledgable.  Nobody in our party really cared that she had \"fifteen years of experience in the business,\" because the bottom line was that despite the decent quality of the food served, her restaurant was so poorly mismanaged that four people were totally turned off by the experience and  were unanimous in their decision that they'd never give the place a second chance."}
{"text":"I should have listened to my inside voice....this isn't a place to get a good meal..maybe a beer and watch a game on TV.  Ordered the meatloaf with onion straws, mashed potatoes and broccoli.  It all sucked.  Couldn't chew through the veggies....weren't cooked.  The onion straws were like bungee cord and the meat loaf I wonder if it contained any meat.  The service sucked to.  I had to ask for my bill as I never saw her after she took my order.  Avoid ordering food...get a beer instead.  They did take half off my bill though when the waitress asked how my meal was."}
{"text":"I had made plans to meet an old friend and one of her friends for lunch at Blue Martini. I did not realize that Blue Martini was not open for lunch until we arrived, so we decided to eat at Cadillac Ranch instead. 

We were seated quickly and given special lunch menus. They had a variety of things for us to choose from for around $9, including a 'pick two' deal where you got half of a sandwich and a side. 

The friend-of-my-friend inquired about the soups for the day. Since it was Friday we were not surprised to hear clam chowder was an option, as well as a baked potato soup. Our waiter was very honest and told us that you do not get many clams with the chowder. That is pretty lame but I appreciated the honesty. So I asked his opinion on the ahi tuna salad sandwich I was considering and the look on his face made it clear I needed to continue to look. 

Finally decided on the slider again for my sandwich, extra sauce this time. And bowl of the baked potato soup. When the food came out, I had fries with my slider. The waiter asked if we needed silver wear, which I would if my order had came out correct, so I pointed out my lack of soup. He quickly rectified the situation. 

I was glad he did, the soup was the best part of my meal. It had carrots in it though, which seemed out of place. My slider was smothered with onion strings and slightly more sauce then my previous visit. 

Overall I just was not impressed. I really did appreciate the honesty about the food, but all that did was solidify my 'meh' feeling toward Cadillac Ranch."}
{"text":"We just got out of work and needed a quick bite to eat before grocery shopping and boy are we glad we came here, we sat at the back bar and we were instantly greeted by Patrick our bartender. Great service super knowledgeable and super friendly! Served us some amazing tacos from the happy hour menu and gave us a wonderful description of dessert, because of this guy we are coming back. 
My fiancé and I out in the restaurant hospitality industry and this guy made our experience wonderful. 
Thanks Patrick for making tonight A plus all the way!"}
{"text":"21 oz. Bone-in Ribeye with mashed potatoes and asparagus is incredible.  Made to perfection.  Somehow this is the best side salad ever also."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere, food is average. Nothing really stood out on the menu. We had a coupon so we decided to try it. I had the barbque chicken salad which was good and a came in a large portion. Would go back again for the atmosphere."}
{"text":"I ate here this past Friday with a dining companion.  Cadillac Ranch was extremely crowded upon arriving and we were told that there would be a 45 minute wait.  During the wait we got to check out he decor of the restaurant which was nice with lots of music and Western apparel visible.  Our wait did only last as long as we were told but it was very frustrating as there were many open tables that were not being sat.  We watched one table sit for 20 minutes between being cleaned and having people put in it.  The table that we were eventually put in sat for at least 10 minutes before we were seated.  It's not like there were spreading out the tables for the servers either as our server was triple-sat in a 5 minute window.  For me this was very perplexing as the bars were beyond packed and the wait list was not too long.

For dinner I ended up ordering the Ranch Mac' N Cheese while my dining companion had the pork chops.  Our dinner was served quickly and my Mac' N Cheese came out piping hot.  It's flavor was great and it was something that I thoroughly enjoyed eating.  My dining companion also enjoyed her pork chops.

The bottom line for me is that I will head back to the Cadillac Rance again but not on a weekend night.  Their food was great and although they quoted the right amount of time to be seated, it was very frustrating to see the many empty tables sitting for a long time before the hostess would seat people."}
{"text":"Ive never been here to eat, but have heard good things.

While the drinks were good (go bartenders!) the ambiance here at night is kind of tragic. 

If you an to go here anytime after 9, try and get a seat on the patio."}
{"text":"If you are coming just for the drinks then this is a great place...but the food is equivelent to an average meal at TGIF or Applebees. 

Again ..the bar staff is always great...but the food/wait staff aren't too good. Last visit our food was brought out by back of the house staff, waitress saw they came so never came until we were done, i ate my entire meal without a drink and our fries were cold/hard, probably cooked 2 or 3 times. 

Go to their bar, I'd avoid dinner"}
{"text":"Nothing great about this place.  Typical suburban bar and restaurant.  I was actually attacked inside of this establishment about two years ago."}
{"text":"The restaurant was pretty empty when we walked in, yet no one was seating anyone. So we sat at the bar and ordered some drinks. My drink took 20 minutes because she had forgotten to make it. Mind you, not a crowded night at all. Actually, it was pretty quiet inside. Next, I ordered an appetizer, beer battered mushrooms and my friend ordered chips and salsa. Both were just average. Nothing special. Plus, the waitress/bartender was rude. Not a good experience at all."}
{"text":"eh.

I tried it out for lunch with a friend.. nothing special. Menu is uninspired, but what do you want for a restaurant with \"ranch\" in the name? 

The service was sub par.. it was a bit hectic in the place, didn't seem to have any flow of any kind. just random employees. walked in and no hostess, no-one to direct us and not a single employee acknowledged us. I am not upset about it.. but i was hungry and looking to sit.. so I didn't know if I was supposed to seat myself. Then a little blond came out and asked if there was anything she could help us with. 

I said, \"yes.. we would like to sit and eat\".. she just looked at me as if i said something wrong. I dunno what it was about. then they put us in a crowded section where the server was just overwhelmed. She as very friendly.. very friendly.. and inquired about 4 times as to what we were doing later. So we told her, but she seemed uninterested. So maybe I just read the whole place wrong. 

Our food took about 20 minutes and the appetizer of chicken fingers never showed. We just canceled them cuz the mains were there. The manager decided to bring them anyway and said they would just go to waste. It was a nice gesture.. but you could tell they had been forgotten in the window.. cuz they were just less than warm. Oh well, I ate 3 of them anyway. I had ordered only a Iceberg wedge salad because I wasn't into anything else and the chicken fingers and the salad were going to be the meal for me. 

I would go again for a drink and some snacks. Nothing to rush back for. The place looks cool and it would be fun to watch some drunk patrons ride the mechanical bull. Maybe even get up there myself...probably not though."}
{"text":"Kristen here.

Kevin and I have been to Cadillac Ranch on several occasions, and each time we walk away satisfied, but never thrilled. During our last visit, we attended happy hour (half off appetizers!) about 5PM on a weekday. The place was slow. I ordered a Mango Tango Margarita, and Kevin ordered a beer of some sorts. I am not a beer reviewer, nor do I enjoy beer at all in the first place. My margarita was pretty good. I typically really enjoy fruity drinks, ESPECIALLY mango drinks, but this one left me feeling somewhat disappointed. I can't put my finger on it, although there just may have been too much alcohol in it. I would try something different next time. 

For the appetizer, we ordered the soft pretzel with a cream cheese dip. Amazing. Simply amazing. If it weren't for this saving grace, I would have rated Cadillac Ranch as 2 stars. The pretzel was perfectly golden brown and soft, and the dip was creamy and only enhanced the flavor of the pretzel. The pretzel and dip danced hand in hand on my tongue and all the way into my stomach. Kevin agreed that this was a marvelous appetizer, and for half off the price, how could you not get this? I would go back just to get an order of it.

For our entrees, I got the AZ Mac and Cheese. This is my favorite dish I have found on the menu, and I really enjoy it. I do not particularly like spicy foods, but this dish has just the right amount of bite. This is a baked macaroni with pepper jack cheese and chicken. I eat around the chicken, though, because I don't find that the chicken enhances the flavor of the dish. Just the macaroni alone is great. If I go to CR again, and I probably will, I will get this dish. It remains consistent and very, very good.

Kevin ordered the Phoenix Cheese Steak. Word of warning: do not make that same mistake. I have had many cheese steaks in the past, and I they never quite reach their potential (see our Forefathers review... they have the best cheese steaks I have ever had). This cheese steak was completely underwhelming. So underwhelming, that - get this - Kevin didn't even finish it. If you know Kevin, you know that he almost always finishes what is on his plate. He agreed that the sandwich was disappointing. According to Kevin, there was way too much bread and not enough meat, and the meat was dry. I only took one bite and I was not impressed. Do not get this item. You will regret it, guaranteed.

We will most likely revisit this place because it is in an ideal location (right in the middle of Tempe Marketplace) and the food is pretty good for the most part. The atmosphere is cozy and inviting. We have yet to witness the bull in action, but I'm sure that he makes the place come alive. Here's to hoping that next visit will somewhat redeem this one."}
{"text":"We went there for my daughter's B-Day dinner. The food took forever, I mean forever. It's 8:00 on a Tuesday and there were not alot of people  there, so why the long wait? Who knows? I asked if they sang or gave the b-day person a dessert...the waitress said they don't do anthing but that she will do something. I thought that was nice of her. However, she hardly came around,not even to refill our drinks, and even took forever to give us our check!!
The inside and outside was cool-What was up in the bathroom? On all the sinks were hairspray,lotion,towels, deodorant - it looked like a bathroom from an all girls dorm room in college. Oh yeah and there were two ladies just hanging out like they were bathroom attendants or something...
The food was alright, nothing special...The house made potato chips topped with cheese and balsamic vinegar was good but came cold.
I will give this place another chance one day I guess, I'm not in a hurry though..."}
{"text":"Damn...two trips to Cadillac Ranch in two different states in one weekend.  I thoroughly hate myself.  My friend Hailes picked me up from the airport and I told her about my weekend, and included hating Cadillac Ranch in Vegas.  I also told her I was going to stop drinking after the weekend I had.  So I get home, ready to enjoy some Cherry Limeade and stop feeling like the drunk fool I am, and then my girl Katie calls.  She wants to watch the Bears game so we agree to meet up at Four Peaks.  The place is packed and I'm too drunk to think off any place to go so we decide on Cadillac Ranch.  Again, I hate myself.
Luckily the place was pretty empty so we sat right at the bar to enjoy the game.  I don't like that they don't have any beers on tap, but they have a decent enough selection of bottled beers to appease me.  I hadn't eaten for the whole weekend (cheaper to drink!) so I ordered the chopped salad with chicken and avocado.  There was no avocado when I got it.  A little sad about that.  And the salad itself was just plain.  The olives were chopped way too small and the beans and corn were sparse.  I also had destroyed my taste buds in Vegas by smoking cigars and drinking endlessly, so it is possible the salad was okay.
The reason this place gets three stars in because of the bartender Buddy.  He took the shit talking from my drunk friend, talked smack on the Asian Johnny Bravo, and kept us drunk!  Thanks for the shots Buddy, and thanks for getting the orange dusted with cinnamon for my Patron shots!  It didn't make it taste any better, but I'm glad you went all out for me.  We were sad to see you finish your shift before we finished drinking!"}
{"text":"The door man sucks ass!  I don't know where he gets off thinking he is so special, but he was being a total douche to my friend.  My friend had an Indiana driver's license and asked him what year he graduated high school, if he had any other ID, etc.  It was like the Spanish Inquistion.  He had no problem letting me in and I have a CA ID.  Didn't understand that.  Oh wait, I'm a girl, so I guess the tits let me get into bars with ease.  I should tell my friend to work on getting boobs, then he won't have to deal with asshole door men.  The only reason this place gets a star at all if because of the bartender who profusely apologized about the door man.  Other than that, this place is a total douche fest.  But we're in Vegas, so I guess that's to be expected."}
{"text":"Over priced 
Bad service

Took over 10 mins for the server to even stop by the table to get our drink orders. Then it took another 10 to get our food order placed. There was plenty of staff on hand, as there were servers standing around doing nothing. Once the food finally arrived almost 45 mins after we got seated it was terrible and terribly over-priced. Last time I'll be going here."}
{"text":"I'm surprised this place has such negative reviews because my experience was pleasant. Our server was fast and attentive, always making sure we had a beer in hand. Our food was delivered quickly and tasted fine. The only thing I didn't like was the tarter sauce for the fish and chips which was no big deal. The avocado egg rolls were great! The happy hour prices are what drew us in and we got them sitting in the restaurant. I would come back to this place without hesitation."}
{"text":"Worst dj.  10 seconds of good music per 5 minutes of bad.  Trashy people.  But the place was packed - perhaps this is what people want in Arizona."}
{"text":"So, it's a Saturday night and I'm in town for business. I went and saw a movie at the Cinemark right by the Cadillac Ranch. By the time I got out, it was 10:50pm and there wasn't much else open and around, so I took a chance. I was by myself by the way. Anyway, the hostess didn't seem like she wanted to seat me, because she kept pushing for me to go to the bar. Finally I got a table and Alexis came and took my order and waited on me. She was awesome. Definitely felt a little out of place, as there was lots of drinking and dancing going on, but I was hungry. Alexis really took care of me. Her only \"slip up\" of the night was after she brought my credit card receipt back she said, \"Have a good night...okay?\" (tilt of the head). Ouch! I'm out of town and I was hungry and it was late. I ordered the Basalmic Chicken. It was actually pretty dang good. Three chicken breasts, mashed potatoes and green beans. It was really loud in here, but that's to be expected on a Saturday night. I believe there was a girl celebrating her birthday and bunch of employees from Victoria's Secret there."}
{"text":"ok so the service is decent yet slow but it's all soooo worth it just for one reason:
they have these new cream cheese and bacon filled wan-tons  with a chile/maple syrup drizzle that is like thailand and the waffle house made the messiah.
THEY ARE TO DIE FOR"}
{"text":"If I was writing this review in October of 2010, I probably would of given this place four stars. Fast forward to now after my second visit, boy has this place gone downhill.

The very first time I came here with my boyfriend, we had a Groupon ($15 for a $30 gift card). He enjoyed his meal, I enjoyed my burger. The burger was delicious and the fries are GREAT. We like the huge TV for football games, and I like when they play country music. We had a few dollars leftover so we got a dessert. They were 'out' of the one I wanted, so I had to get something I didn't really like, but it was still good. Last month we came here again because I got a coupon from LocalDines.com, (another $15 for $30 coupon) and my boyfriend tried something new. He thought it was alright. I had the same thing, a burger and fries. While the fries were delicious, the bun was SUPER dry. It was so gross and pretty much falling apart. I could barely even finish half of it because it wouldn't stay in one piece. We still had some leftover so we got a dessert. We got a cheesecake which turned out to be $7 or $8! What the heck? Shouldn't be that expensive for something so silly. It's cheesecake! Not fondue or something. 

The top off comes next. We got our bill, and we were charged 18% gratuity for a party of 2. We had to wait FOREVER for our waitress, who I ended up having to get out of my booth and flag down when it wasn't busy at all. She said that is what the coupon stated, so we said okay, that's fine, not her fault. But then my boyfriend says that he isn't going to give her an extra tip if the tip is already included from the gratuity, and she said, \"I wasn't asking you to\" in the rudest way possible. You can bet your bottom dollar we didn't give her an extra tip, especially after having to pay all that extra for gratuity. So 2 stars for okay food, rude/lazy employees, overpriced food and extremely overpriced/bad selection of desserts. 

Also, like other reviewers have stated, it's overpriced. Go to Chili's instead."}
{"text":"I feel like i yelped this place before but i guess not...Cadillac was okay for food. Bartenders are good they do their job and give you great pours. 

Food on the 15 minutes or it's free menu actually do come out at  15 minutes on the dot.. Yeah i timed it, what? 

I wouldn't really come back there are just too many other better bars than this place to go to.

Also i do prefer dives so that is my bias views for you."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and the only thing that I like to go here for are the Happy Hour prices, mostly drinks, and to people watch. The food is OK and music can be obnoxiously LOUD, like, SO annoying loud that you feel like you've been in a club all night lol. 

They have a really nice outdoor seating area and on the weekends, they open up the dance floor. The main feature to this place is the Mechanical Bull. It's so fun to watch drunk girls ride the bull and drunks guys GAWK at them lol. We like this place, but don't make it a habit."}
{"text":"I have never had bad service in the 4-5 times I have been here in the last two months and this is the perfect after work cool off happy hour joint.

The beer is never stale and I always get another when needed / requested.

apps are always great

I have more con's about the cheesers who seem to irritate the bar tenders / wait staff than the joint itself.

I would recommend this as a good place to chill with your friends and kick back a few drinks. #GoDevils"}
{"text":"came here on June 27th.... its a fucking bootleg ass version of LA's saddle ranch. The owner is a fucking racist. They let in all kinds of trashy motherfuckers in their trashy ass flip flops...  but they wouldn't let the homies in because they had \"baggy clothes\", baggy what? who the fuck,... this isn't middle school? its a fucking restaurant. you fucking idiots, and your fucking fake ass top flight security guards. go somewhere with that bullshit. never going here again !"}
{"text":"Came back for the pork chops and was a bit disappointed that I got the end chop no bone! Manager came and graciously ordered me a bone in chop no problem! Now that's great customer service. Husbands soup was delicious but sliders a bit overcooked. Enjoyed the visit."}
{"text":"Was visiting my bff in Vegas and we moseyed on over here after leaving Blue Martini (for lack of better music). It was a Saturday night and probably passed 11pm. I don't remember paying cover. I'm pretty sure I didn't. I was already tipsy. I didn't buy any drinks here. The music was ok. Later on in the night it got a lot better though. The place was kinda chill. There were a lot of people but it was big enough that it wasn't crowded. It had a nice patio area. Plenty of space to dance. There's a mechanical bull but my skirt was much too short."}
{"text":"Expected more bbq options , nice environment with a great outdoor seating area. Great place for meeting friends for drinks and flatbreads / tacos. Pulled pork sandwich was good too!"}
{"text":"I was with a large group of people for a friend's going away party and they had decided on Cadillac Ranch as the venue.  I arrived a little bit later than everyone else so they had already ordered food and several rounds of drinks.  I was worried that the server wouldn't notice me and I'd have to wait for ever to get something but she was actually pretty quick to come over and get my order.  She did a good job throughout the night of keeping up with everyone too so I was impressed with that.

What I didn't like was later on around 10 or so she comes by and randomly asks if we'd like the check to which I gave her a confused look and an answer of \"no\".  We're at a bar that doesn't close until 2 am, we're having a good time, and no one has asked for a check, in fact I'd like another round while you're here.  Then a little while later she explains that she's leaving so she needs us to close out our tabs and then go to the bar for everything we wanted.  This was annoying but it's not like we could ask the girl to stay the whole night.  I did like the fact that she separated our tabs out for us and was very nice about it even though it was kind of confusing.  Food and drinks were average but nothing mind blowing which is pretty much my consensus on the service as well.  Nothing really sucked but nothing was great either.  Solid 3 stars."}
{"text":"It pays to have low expectations!

Stopped here for lunch out of pure curiosity, not expecting much.

Chose to sit on the patio, was greeted in a decent amount of time by Brandy. She was very patient and helpful. Definitely made the experience gain an extra star.

Ordered the spinach dip as an app, like most restaurants there weren't nearly enough chips on the plate but we were delightfully offered more. The dip tasted pretty fresh unlike most chains variations.

My date had the lemon mushroom chicken, which was very tasty. I ordered the Diablo chicken pasta which wasn't as good. The sauce wasn't bad and the pasta cooked to a good temperature but the chicken was just tough and chewy- not of the same consistency as the lemon mushroom chicken. 

All in all I'd say this place isn't too far from an Applebee's or Friday's type concept. The restaurant itself was clean and very spacious, sadly I'm not sure if it's completely worth the price."}
{"text":"The service could be a little bit better here.  But it is a large enough restaurant and bar with both front and back outside patios.  The back patio has a bar there so you don't have to try to flag someone down for a drink.  I do have to say their appetizers were pretty good, during happy hour the appetizers were all $5 each.

It is a little hard to compete with Blue Martini, since they are right next to each other.  Blue Martini has a bit more livelier and modern feel to it.  But those that want to have some drinks and get enough courage to ride the mechanical bull, with a laid back atmosphere, this would be a good place to go.  If you have out of town visitors that have the cowboys in them, they would feel right at home here!"}
{"text":"Very disappointed.

The best part of our night was that we were seated promptly. Things went down from there. The wait staff was inattentive and very slow. We ordered a margarita flat bread pizza and wings to start. The best part of the pizza was the crust, as expected it was crispy. But the pizza had no taste to it at all, very bland. The wings came out cold, and were below average in quality. Our entrees were not any better. My wife ordered the fish and chips. The fries were okay, the fish was greasy and overcooked. While this is better than being undercooked, it tasted like it was fried in 2 week old oil that has not been filtered or cleaned. VERY GREASY, VERY GROSS!!! I ordered the Pittsburgh Steak Salad, and was unimpressed. The steak was undercooked for how I ordered it, and very bland. They used steak fries that were in a greasy cheesy pile on one side of the plate. I would have preferred to have the fries my wife was served with her fish and chips on my salad.

Overall, 1 star is too good. This was our first and only visit. I found it too dark, with bad club music. With a name like Cadillac Ranch, and an advertisement for a mechanical bull, I expected more of a country music atmosphere. Prices were slightly more expensive than they should of been for the amount of food served, and way too expensive for the quality of food."}
{"text":"A great place to eat with a fun atmosphere. I love going here when I travel to Pittsburgh. It's always a delight."}
{"text":"I've visited Cadillac Ranch on many occasions so I figure it's time I officially give them a review. While I haven't been here many times for a sit down dinner I have been here many times for happy hour. With the Cinemark right next door it's a great place to meet up for drinks/appetizers before a show. Especially on a Tuesday for discount movie day!

The few times I actually sat down for a meal I was impressed with the food. I typically always go with a salad and I've always liked them. They also have a lot of really good drinks on their menu. Their mojito's are amazing! My only complaint is that their drink prices are fairly expensive. Because they are so expensive I typically never order them. I stick to basic drinks during happy hour to avoid paying those prices.

Last but not least, I want to hit on their awesome happy hour. Besides Mad Mex I would say this is definitely my favorite happy hour spot in Robinson. They have a happy hour food menu which includes different items for $3, $4, and $5. Some of the items include chicken quesadilla, boneless wing, chili nachos, fries, soft pretzels, tacos, flatbreads, etc. Over the years I have tried a lot of them and I have to say the only one so far that I haven't liked is the chicken quesadilla's. My go to is always the nachos and I'm actually very picky about my nachos. So trust me they are good. 

If you haven't tried Cadillac Ranch for happy hour or dinner yet I highly recommend it! They also do live music in the summer outside which is really nice and I think they even have a special on entrees if you stop in after a movie with your ticket stub."}
{"text":"Wow!  When I got to this restaurant on Yelp I never expected to see such an undeservedly low rating.  We had dinner there tonight for the first time, and had a blast.

First, I should say that we are not the typical Friday night customers - we're old enough to be the parents of most every patron in the place, so you might think we were like fish out of water.  It was very loud and jam-packed, just the kind of atmosphere I usually hate.  But it had an energy that was infectious!

Maybe it helped that there was a promo going on - sign up at the door and get three tickets for free drinks (white wine or vodka+) from 6-9 pm.  Just my kind of drinks.  So by the time we got to sit down for dinner we weren't feeling much pain.

We had a coupon from the newspaper for a BOGO.  Our very attentive waitress told us about the night's specials, and we decided to order the mahi mahi in coconut and mango something or other, plus the Chicken Diablo from the regular menu.  We asked if we could use the coupon on the special.  She said yes, but returned a moment later, very apologetic, and said that it was good only from Monday to Thursday.  My husband is never one to hear the word \"no\" and accept it as Gospel, so he asked her to send over the manager.  The manager, Eric, came over right away. Before hubby could even open his mouth, Eric, smiling, said he has trouble reading tiny print, too, and of course they'd take the coupon.  We were very surprised, not only by his agreeing to do it, but also by the friendly and gracious attitude he had.  There are way too many restaurant owners and managers who don't understand the \"Word of Mouth\" concept, but this manager was not one of them.  And we are diehard loyalists, and go out of our way to tell people when we've had such positive experiences.

Happily, I don't have to make up anything positive.  Our waitress was really, really good - friendly, efficient, but not intrusive.  And the food was very good, too.  The mahi mahi dish was excellent.  The Chicken Diablo was good.  It could have used a little kick to help it live up to the name, but the penne wasn't overcooked and there wasn't too much sauce or salt.

All in all, we had a terrific time and a very good dinner, and we look forward to going back."}
{"text":"Not terrible but not memorable either.  Pulled pork sandwich was better than expected but once again not memorable.  Place seemed very large which did not create the best ambiance in my opinion"}
{"text":"The only reason this isn't getting a one star review is because the service was good. I'm usually not a complainer but I hated my meal. 

I had their Bourbon Steak which is not on their real menu but on their dinner special hand out. It came with green beans and mashed potatoes. The green beans were tasty I finished all of those but the mashed potatoes had the after taste of medical gauze. I took two bites and that's all I could handle. I asked for the steak to be medium well so it would be juicy but it was still dry . I tried to doctor it up with some A-1 sauce and it was still blah. I know this place is not gourmet but I did expect it to be comparable to TGI Fridays, Applebees, and if you want to go old school ....Sizzler. It just didn't cut it in my book. 

I didn't want to say anything to my husband who was paying for the meal but I guess he saw it on my face. He was like, \"What's wrong...did I do something wrong?\" He probably thought I was giving him grief about smiling too much at the waitress or something like that. I was like \"no\"...then he really thought he was in trouble for something so I finally told him I was not happy with my meal. He told me to send it back ...I didn't want to get back a spit drenched steak so I opted for settling for it. 

I also ordered a cocktail called Rock Candy it was a $12.00 dollar drink but since it was happy hour it came out to $6.00. I had my ideas about what it would look like before it came out. In my head I pictured it in a big Margarita glass the contents being bright pink and a stick of blue rock candy sticking out of it. I thought for this price it should not only taste good but it should look cute too! When the waitress brought it out I thought it was water with lemons in it. Then she came back to ask me how I liked my drink. I didn't try it yet because I thought it was just water so I took a sip of it and told her it was good. The first couple of sips was good but not great. It tasted more and more like watered down lemonade as time went on. 

We had the Banana's Foster for dessert which I thought I would like because I've had one before. Their version is something I have not experienced till now ...first of all there was no crepe...boo! It was warm bananas swimming around in creme sauce with a scoop of vanilla ice ream in the middle drizzled with caramel. The warm bananas are good as a breakfast meal but not for dessert. So I only took about three bites of that. 

I don't like writing bad reviews so I'll end this on what I did like. If it wasn't for the Cadillac Ranch State Fries I think I would have went home hungry. These are jumbo potato seasoned fries with cheese bacon and sour cream. I should have ordered two of these for my meal and I would have walked out a happy camper!"}
{"text":"I'm not sure where to really start to review this place.

It is in a great location at Town Square, so it could be a good place to stop in if you were shopping there or going tothe movies there. It has kinda cool decor...sort of a rock n' roll theme with guitars on the wall and photos of people like Taylor Swift & Bon Jovi. The bar has lots of TVs for sports, too.

We went in the afternoon, so it was really dead, which made me feel like the service should have been fantastic, but it wasn't. Our sever, Danielle, seemed to be stoned out of her mind. She talked really really slow, and said things like \"restauarants are in my genetic make up\" and \"I can make recommendations 'cause I work here\". She was nice enough, but there was visible dirt under her fingernails and she kept leaning all over the table to make her aforementioned recommendations...which kinda grossed me out.

The food and drinks took FOREVER which, again, I couldn't understand since were were practically the only people there. We ended up ordering 2 appetizers (pulled pork sliders & cheeseburger sliders) and sharing. Both were served with french fries that were ICE COLD. The sliders were pretty good, but nothing spectacular.

It took forever to get the check, and the bill came to over $30 for only the 2 appetizers, an iced tea, and a soda. So, in my opinion, WAY over priced!

I can pretty much say with certainty, I won't be back."}
{"text":"I used to LOVE this place when it first opened.  It was a great afternoon hangout with friends.  They had great happy hour pricing, and great music (especially the old hairband videos showing on the TV's).  The food was really good as well.

Until...   Last year the happy hour changed dramatically.  Making it quite an unhappy hour.   Very poor specials and terrible pricing.  The service became worse as a result as well.  They can't keep good staff anymore.  The food has become very bland.  And once I was told that happy hour was only on the outdoor patio.  Yes, the SMOKING patio.  The same one that has become overrun with Loud and disrespectful ASU students.  

I'm not sure how this place went downhill so fast.   I won't go back anymore.  Will miss the decor though.  It's by far the best thing about this place."}
{"text":"We had a good time there but I think that was thanks to Cardinals NFC game.  Service was pretty good until it really got crowded and then the service was sparse.  
The food is over priced.  The wings were good but the Nachos not so good.  Some of our group got burgers and said they were average at an above average price.  
It could be a fun place to go but it needs some touch ups.  They have lots of TV's for the games and were pretty easy to see."}
{"text":"Meatloaf sandwich was yummy.  A bit pricey considering the food style and portions."}
{"text":"Cadillac Ranch is always a good time! I love the location at Tempe Marketplace and think they have a superior patio (my only complaint is all the smoke-- but that's not their fault).

Parking is free, it's easy to get to, the space is large so it's never too crowded (even when there are a ton of people there), drink and food selection is great and I love the decor! Where else can you sit under the cover of Rolling Stone magazine from the 80s with Jon Bon Jovi on it?

This is a great place for lunch and the portions are just above medium size. Dinner is great too- just don't go for a late meal as you'll be trying to eat as the beautiful people who are looking to party show up and the DJ turns up the volume. I love the AZ Mac N Cheese- try it!

At night, this is one of the places to be seen in Tempe. CR turns into a great nightclub with great music and atmosphere! There's not a bad looking bartender in the lot either. I miss the mechanical bull because it was always a treat to watch drunk people try to stay on 8 seconds, but I get that it was probably a liability!

Finally, this is a great place for happy hour and groups. I have met here with my sorority alumni group on occasion and they've always been really accommodating!"}
{"text":"Was 2 stars for very average bar food... until my four year old got sick off of their food.  Cute girls doing all the work, but no redeeming qualities after that.  Do yourself a favor and go to the Yard House downstairs instead."}
{"text":"I can't really comment on the food since all we ordered was chips with queso and salsa which we didn't really eat due to the excessive amount of salt in all three. However, they had a surprisingly decent selection of beer on tap so the hubby and I spent an enjoyable afternoon day drinking on the patio and taking advantage of the happy hour half price drafts. We sat at the bar since the hostess informed us that there was a wait for tables on the patio even though there were a couple empty ones and I didn't see anyone waiting. Even from the bar we had good people watching opportunities courtesy of the shoppers below, no less than three tvs to watch, and a view of the acoustic guitar singer who started playing shortly after we arrived.

On a Sunday afternoon it was mostly families and couples just hanging out. But I get the feeling that this place makes most of its money from rowdy college kids in the evenings.  Since that is not my scene and I didn't see anything too appetizing on the menu or coming out of the kitchen, I doubt we'll be back.  But I had to give them that extra star for the awesome patio and local craft brews. Too bad they allow smoking out there, but again I guess I am not their target demographic."}
{"text":"We meet friends here on monday night. We had a couple appetizers, i.e. jalopeno poppers, nachos, chicken quesadilla, ribbitizer. Food was great from the happy hour menu. But after many long beach iced tea's and patron shots everything taste good."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is nice and the TVs with sports on everywhere is a bonus. The food was good. I would recommend the nachos as a starter. The burgers were good but not the best I've ever had. The server was friendly, but scarce. The price was reasonable. I would come back."}
{"text":"An excellent experience here last night! I love the atmosphere and the staff is friendly. We were seated right away (it was around 9) and got drinks promptly. We ordered loaded fries for an app, they were ok. Could've been cheesier but they were crispy and tasty. I always take forever to figure out what I want to eat and the waitress was very patient with me which I appreciate lol. I got blackened tilapia with smashed redskin potatoes and balsamic drizzle - SO GOOD. My boo got fish tacos which were tiny but meant to be a smaller plate- he said they were delicious as well. The server was so accommodating (I always have a billion leftovers) she gave us boxes and to go cups for our drinks (this is a huge thing for me I dunno why) and got the check for us right when we were ready to go. Awesome meal and I'll be back for sure !"}
{"text":"Don't be fooled by happy hour prices. I went yesterday and the waitress talked about 1/2 price appetizers, drinks, well drinks, etc. That price is only good at the bar. If you are at a table you will not get it. I went with some friends and we ordered drinks and appetizers. An order of chicken wings, an order of pretzels, 2 double vodka & 7ups, a single vodka & 7up and 4 coke & crowns. All ordered before 7pm when happy hour is over. Total price $ 71. Someone in management must have ridden that bull and hit their head - and the waitresses false advertise until the bill comes. If you are out for a happy hour in Tempe drive on past this place."}
{"text":"Great set up, outdoor, indoor is open, live music, great happy hour prices, and good food!"}
{"text":"Food was pretty good. Service and staff were horrible. Upon walking in there were what appeared to be three hostesses standing up front all huddled together on cell phones. They looked at our group and continued their conversation. I had to say that there will be three of us to get any attention at all. Our waitress was fairly polite. The bartender near by were very rude however, did not smile and it was clear she did not want to be bothered. Our food took quite a while to get to us and it was not even slightly busy. Our dessert took even longer. All in all it was sub par and I would say not worth the prices you will pay."}
{"text":"After Johnny McGuire's, my cousins and I decided to hang out at Cadillac Ranch to watch the rest of the game. We just went with Miller Lite on tap since it was only $2.50 a cup - a crappy plastic cup, but whatever.

This place seems like a decent spot. If you're an MMA fan, it looks like they show the PPVs on a regular basis. I guess we didn't stay long enough for me to form a negative opinion of Cadillac Ranch. Skimming other reviews, it appears to get a bad rap. As for me, I think it's A-OK."}
{"text":"Best burger I've ever had, and a great view from the patio.  Enjoyed a wonderful date with my husband there."}
{"text":"CHECK YOUR RECEIPTS! Our waiter Jamal creatively added a larger tip than written in. I've been going there for years but never had such terrible service (wrong drink, slow service) and I've never had fraud committed from Cadillac Ranch. I treated him kindly as did my lunch companions and am ashamed to have suggested this place for lunch."}
{"text":"If I could give this place negative stars I would. I have never been so humiliated in my whole life. I was there on a sunday evening for my 21st birthday and they denied my I.D. even though I had my social security card, my bank card my school I.D. and my medical card. I was made to stand up in the middle of the restaurant, take off my shoes, sign my signature twice, call my friends phone to show my name and still denied service. At this point I was in tears as my two friends asked if we needed to pay for the fries we did not even touch and the manager said NO.  As we left to go to Dave and Busters next door the manager from Cadillac Ranch had called there and said we \"refused\" to pay and we were not let into any of the surrounding restaurants. Keep in mind this was my 21st birthday.  I will make sure that NO ONE I KNOW will EVER go to Cadillac Ranch."}
{"text":"This place had the best happy hour specials!  I tried the Bay Seasoning dry rub wings and I still crave them to this day.  They had the best taste and dipped in that sauce it was amazing.  My co-workers tried just about everything on the happy hour menu and I tasted a little bit of it all.  Nothing wasn't great.  

It was very loud in there, but I can see why with the specials they have.  A very large drink selection with cocktails and beers.  Nice place to go after work and hear some live music."}
{"text":"Came into the Tempe location on Sunday Feb 19th to celebrate three brother's Feb birthday with some of our family. Have to say that is was a bad choice to choose CR. We had to wait almost a half hour for our party of 12 to be seated. This in a restaurant that was not even 25% full, much less busy. The drink order came quick enough, but the food did NOT. Took approximately 25+ minutes for the food to get to the table, and even then it came in spurts. Some of the party was served and eating before the rest of us got our plates. My son ordered an order of custom potatoes, which came to the table COLD. Clearly, when it came back to the table, it had only been tossed in the microwave and he was NOT served a fresh order. The last insult was that even though we had the waitress put the order on separate checks, the bill still came to me with a gratuity already entered. I understand the whole \"large parties will automatically....\" business, but if I had NOT had a two person tab tacked with a gratuity, the waitress would have received more. As is, I was irritates and left it as is. I would have to call our dining experience a complete fail, and really can't see me coming back without some sort of reply or incentive. Not sure if in this economy you were trying to save money by short staffing, had a new or inexperienced cook in the kitchen, or what the problem was. As is, would have to give the experience a \"D\""}
{"text":"Food was OK. Steak was luke warm, and the garlic mashed potatoes... Where's the garlic  I questioned if the kitchen was clean after seeing the men's restrooms. The restroom was unsightly, hand towels overflowed from the trash receptacle and the smell was horrific, it appears it was not cleaned from the night before. I think if the restrooms are not clean, what must the kitchen look like."}
{"text":"Surprised to see so many children sitting at the bar at least no one was smoking at the same time"}
{"text":"Typical chain bar average overpriced food.  I have been to the location twice and don't get me wrong the food is okay but the prices are high and that's not good when the food is just edible.  It is a large place and a bit easier to get a table in this busy location but i'd say just get there a bit earlier and go to Anthony's pizza."}
{"text":"I had never been to Cadillac Ranch before until a group of friends wanted to come here for dinner and drinks. We had a group of five and were seated in the back on a platform which we were told used to be where a mechanical bull lived. It was nice to have our own little space and I liked all the cute lights that decorated it. A few of the girls complained about how dark it was, some even used their cell phones as light to read the menu. I wasn't drinking since I was DD so I ordered an iced tea and it was strong and tasty and never empty. Our waitress had another girl with her training and they both did a decent job.

We ordered the bacon wonton appetizer and it was peculiar to say the least! We all agreed it would be better as a breakfast item, or maybe even desert. They were sweet and salty with a maple syrup type sauce. They were good just not right for a pre meal snack! I ordered the pulled pork sandwich on a pretzel roll and grilled asparagus for my side. It was alright, the sauce they put on the bbq was very mustard based and got old quick. The asparagus was my favorite part of the whole meal. 

I went to wash my hands in the restroom after I was done eating and the paper towel dispenser was awful, it was one of those motion sensor ones and it literally spits out two inches of paper towel each time and there is a waiting period of at least twenty seconds before it gives you more. My friend and I had a good laugh about it for a minute. Also the bathroom seemed even darker than the outside, I could hardly see myself in the mirror! How is a girl supposed to check for food in her teeth or smeared lipgloss? Come on guys give us a little light!

After 9pm a d.j. started to play hip hop hits from the 90's to early 2000 and don't get me wrong I love rap and hip hop but this place is called Cadillac RANCH? I guess we were in the Tempe college area though so anything goes.

I don't know if I would come back here. They need to figure some stuff out for sure!"}
{"text":"I read several of the reviews & they are consistent with what I've experienced.  I've been to this place about 5 times...both for lunch...and late night.  The food is actually pretty good.  I've had the BBQ pork & fries and it was very good.  At night, the place is fun.  They have the bull to ride...and it's interactive to meet people.

But, the BIG, BIG drawback is the service.  Seems like other people have had the same experience -  it's downright terrible.  Every single time I've been there I've had some issue (I'm not that picky either).  The service is very, very slow.  They hired some hot girls..but they certainly aren't the brightest.  The charged my friend for several drinks that we didn't have...and it took them almost 1/2 hour to correct it.

Because of the service, I can only give this place 2 stars.  Good food but I think it's run by a high Shool student."}
{"text":"Staff is always friendly and the bartenders are charismatic! I go at least once a week now to the happy hour! Great drink and food specials from 5-7! If you're going for dinner it can get pricey for basic dishes."}
{"text":"I've been to many places in my life and none of them compare to Cadillac Ranch. Beyond the food and tasty ranch dressing, they have a friendly staff who is always willing to go above and beyond. If you come here, you will probably see me because I come here always. 5 stars but only because that is the maximum amount this app will allow. My true rating is Galaxy."}
{"text":"Nothing to rave about. For the name and appearance I was expecting much more. The burger was dry and lacked seasoning. Plus it tasted like a frozen burger. The nachos were good but not amazing. The service was OK felt rushed to place an order but after the food came out server forget we existed until she wanted the bill to be paid when I asked for a refill of water. After we paid a storm came through the area and knocked out power. The entire staff even after the generator was fired up or the power came back on stood watching it rain. Another customer asked if he could get some service for his table. It was kind of comical as he said you would think they never saw it rain before. Probably wouldn't come back as there are plenty of other choices to spend my money. The prices were on the high side of average."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and I honestly feel that the food has gotten worse each time back; but that's not to say that it was ever very good to begin with.  The scene is lively and it's sort of a novelty with the decor and mechanical bull, and apparently that's how they've managed their success because it certainly isn't due to their food or service.  It's disappointing that a place with obvious financial resources behind it can't come up with more satisfying food or offer better service.  However, the large open space of Cadillac Ranch is good for large groups of people, and the music and scene seem to be entertaining enough to continue to attract clientele."}
{"text":"We went here for lunch after a Steeler game and it was a good atmosphere with typical sports bar food which is what we were looking for and had the different games on their many televisions around the restaurant. We had a great time. The service was a tad slow and they didn't seem that busy as the place was packed but had a good crowd and the food was good."}
{"text":"WHAT PASSES FOR A BOUNCER THESE DAYS ? These guys were skinny and nice. If I were to start a fight with a guy much larger then me, who would save me? If I were picking on somebody smaller then me, who would save them?  The situation felt as if some ASU fraternity guy was in charge of hiring and found all of the rail thin sophomores under 21 to get them into a bar on a Friday night.  (Probably Sig Eps, I have known a few across the nation, little weasels)  My fraternity brothers and I back in Philly (Yo Sammy, Gamma Psi, Temple U) would be starting fights in this place just to prove that we could. 

The bathroom attendant was nice and gave me a towel after I used the urinal. He also selected a nice cologne he had bought for 60 dollars that day!  (He only allowed me one squirt though) 

Overall, I liked the Cadillac Ranch. I was there once for a football game and the Nachos were good. I will return during the peak season and possibly for a football game. There are many large screen T.V.'s .

I would write about the D.J. and his knowledge of late 90's hip-hop but I have already lost interest in this post."}
{"text":"When it's a Tuesday night, and Cadillac Ranch is in dive-bar mode, I like it a lot. Chill music, nice patio, great specials on beer. Since the bar was outdoors, my pals didn't have wander off to have a smoke.

Weeknight specials are awesome. $3 pints of some good stuff like Mission Blonde Ale. I can relax here, and the interior looks so nice I'll definitely come back during peak hours. I'm a fan."}

Made me feel ill afterward.  Service was not horrible but wasn't great either.  They brought out the wrong order for my hubby but corrected it pretty quickly.  It was near empty when we went but all the TVs were blasting at a decibel way too loud for any undrunken ears.  But I suppose it's a whole different experience when you come at night to drink and ride the bull.  Unfortunately we were here for lunch after doing some shopping.  Definitely won't be back..."}
{"text":"I must say some of the less than four stars puzzle me.  My first experience of the New York steak is very good.  The pita with taco fixing was very good too.  Cooked medium meant medium.  Good value price wise and parking was ample.  The atmosphere was bustling and noisy which is good for an informal restaurant."}
{"text":"I'm in Steel Town on business and was looking for a good burger place. I saw the Cadillac Ranch and thought it looked promising. Inside the decor is nice...very traditional sports bar with lots of TVs and sports images. It's very clean and overall looks good. 

However, my meal was disappointing. I ordered the A1 burger. As always, I ordered it medium, challenging the chef's skills at making the perfect burger. He got it wrong, my burger was well done and a bit dry. If you're going to screw up a medium burger I'd prefer it be well done, so at least I can eat it. But I was disappointed. The beer selection is also traditional, I didn't see anything different, or local, to try. 

I should have checked Yelp first before going, since the reviews aren't raving. Lesson learned."}

{"text":"Bless me Yelp for I have sinned. 
It has been two and a half months since my last review.

To be honest, I haven't really been going anywhere. However, I did make it to CR last week and decided to come talk about it.

I had been here a few times prior, but it was always on the weekend in the evening. At this time, this place pretty much sucks - that is unless you like to wait in line, hang around with the type of people that would party at a country/rock nightclub located in a strip mall, deal with bad service, and have no place to sit. If that's your bag, then go here and fill it up.

The other day, I was there on a weeknight right around 7pm. I even stayed for a few hours and ordered food and drink with someone. We don't have a great idea of what the food is like because we only had salads. My Caesar was merely okay. I would eat it again. The other salad was reportedly good. Our drinks were pretty awful though. Margaritas made with cheap liquor... gave us both headaches. They also didn't taste very good. 

On the other hand, their menu had many greasy deep fried things or meaty beef things that sounded like they might be good. The service was good - but that's got to have everything to do with the fact that the place was pretty empty. That didn't stop them from playing Mtv from the 80s - from Bon Jovi to Billy Idol. 

This place also had a bull that I suppose could be ridden by drunk college kids. It wasn't operational while we were there, but I can't imagine it being as entertaining as Saddle Ranch. Having been to the one in LA and the one in Phoenix, I can say that few places can really top or rival the tragic humor that is watching Saddle Ranch bull riding.

Basically, Cadillac Ranch is a generic strip-mall restaurant/bar that has decent service (when it's slow) and edible food. This place has a theme that's a combination of a few different things - none of which accomplished to any sort of accuracy. It's just really average."}
{"text":"Had a mid-week, early evening dinner with a business associate. Restaurant was just over 50% of capacity and we were approached quickly by our waiter who did a terrific job throughout our meal. 

Not knowing the size of the item we started the dinner with an order of Cadillac Ranch Kettle Chips which were tasty and sized for a group of four. His sirloin with a side of asparagus was correctly cooked and my Chicken Carbonara was above average.

Cadillac Ranch would be a great place for a small group (we observed 3 groups of 6-8 friends/co-workers enjoying large table settings) and most families. The decor is fun and there are enough TV's for most sports junkies. If you're looking for a quiet setting that's conducive to quiet conversation, this is definitely not the place. Prices are reasonable as we escaped with a tab of around $75 that included the appetizer, entrees, cocktail, soft drinks and gratuity.

Give it a try. It's an interest setting where we found good service, and above average food at a decent price."}
{"text":"Hitting up Cadillac Ranch just in time for their Happy Hour!  As advertised, it's Mondays through Fridays from 4 pm to 8 pm - half off all drinks and half off appetizers.  (It's actually $7 select appetizers, but half off all drinks still!)

We ordered a couple of drinks off their cocktail menu: 
* Pear...fect 59 Cadillac \"Enjoy our signature cocktail made with Grey Goose La Poire and fresh pear puree.\" ($10) - We were surprised to see it arrive in a martini glass, something to think about if you're expecting a pint glass.  It was sweet and you can definitely taste the pear puree.

* Seville \"Experience a delightful and refreshing blend of Sauza Hornitos Plata, Citronge, Fresh Mango Puree and Fresh Lime Juice.\" ($10) - This arrived in a pint glass and you could definitely taste the alcohol in it.  Decent overall.  

We were initially going to order a bunch of their half off appetizers, but changed our minds after we saw their $7 select appetizer menu.  

They did offer a Complete Dinner for Two for $29.95 from Mondays to Fridays from 4 pm to 8 pm.  (Add 2 Well Drinks - $34.95)  You can choose one select appetizer to share, one select entree each, and one select dessert to share.

* Kettle Chips \"Thinly sliced potatoes deep fried to perfection and served with garlic cream sauce and blue cheese crumbles.  Finished with a Balsamic drizzle and scallions.\" - A hearty portion of tasty potato chips with a yummy creamy garlic sauce and a decent amount of blue cheese crumbles.

* Candied Pecan Pork Chop \"One thick-cut chops grilled and crusted with candied pecans.  Served over caramelized onion mashed potatoes and green beans.\" - Their regular entree course includes two pork chops, but you only get one in the dinner special.  A nice crust on that pork chop.

* Bourbon Sirloin Steak \"8 oz. beef sirloin seasoned and broiled to perfection, then placed on a demi glaze.  Served with garlic mashed potatoes and sauteed green beans.\" - The regular entree course is a 10 oz cut.  Ours was also served with corn.  

* Strawberry Fried Cheesecake - Only available on the dinner special.  Asked the waitress about it and she couldn't say much beyond that she really liked it.  She didn't think it was deep-fried since it wasn't oily.  It's actually a flaky pastry with the cheesecake mixture inside and covered with cinnamon sugar.  Served with a strawberry sauce and cream.

Food and service were okay, nothing special.  The busboys were quick about clearing out the dishes as they needed.  We probably wouldn't eat or drink here without it being happy hour or they were offering a special.  

Some specials they are offering: 

Sundays: Salsa Night, 8 pm to close with a salsa instructor from 9 pm to 10 pm
$3 Corona and Corona Light (from 9 pm to close)
$5 House Margaritas and Cadillac Margaritas (from 9 pm to close)

Mondays: Kids 12 and under eat free, from 11 am to 10 pm with purchase of any full priced entree, free bull rides for all kids"}
{"text":"This was one of the first spots that I visited when I turned 21. I have to admit, Cadillac Ranch was the spot last summer. What is supose to be a restaurant, turns into a mini club at night. They play really good, music, and the place is clean and neat. The waitresses are too pushy, they are all up in your face trying to get you to buy drinks. This is definitely somewhere I would go to hang if I did not feel like being pushed around at a crowded club."}
{"text":"This place was HORRIBLE!!! Never again. I think someone said it best in their review, it was Apleebees Deluxe. 

I ordered the pulled pork sandwich and the bun looked like someone sat on it then tasted like someone farted on it. And the pulled pork looked like something made out of a can. Dog food looks more appealing then this slop. And I ordered the onion rings instead of the fries. There was like 3 onion rings and they were ice cold. The had obviously been sitting in a heat lamp for awhile, but it was so soggy & cold, that it looked like it had been sitting there for days. 

Service was horrendous. The guy who served us was slow and and unattententive. He seemed uninterested in his job and it showed with his body language and attitude. The manager looked like a frumpy customer. His hair was unkept and he was dressed as if he was about to hit up the beach, not manage a restaurant. Super unprofessional looking. 

And then when I left for the evening, the hostess didn't even say good night or anything. I've been so accustomed to hear that now when I dine, when I didn't hear it, it just solidified my bad impression of this place. 

Only bright spot was the bar , which was huge and they had great drink specials. Other then that, this place is definitely a pass. Not surprised everyone else who reviewed this place also had the same experience. Hey, Cadillac Ranch management, fix your issues!!!!!"}
{"text":"In short:  amazing BBQ ribs, good service, great decor, and fairly priced.  But the toilet paper commercials blasting from the Tempe Marketplace P.A. system are a serious detraction - not to mention unappetizing.

We Tucsonans have a weird relationship with our retarded big sibling to the north (by that, I mean the Phoenix Metropolitan Area, or \"The Valley,\" as the Phoenicians call it).  I try to avoid going to Phoenix, and I can be successful for months or even years at a time.

On this occasion, I was registered to run a marathon in Apache Junction (a nice, laid-back, podunk suburb to the east - my kind of place), and I had to pick up my race materials.  Typing the address into the GPS mapping system of my phone, I was surprised to find myself pulling into Tempe Marketplace, which I knew. 
 
Phoenix is so big that I'm always amazed to find myself somewhere familiar.  It's like standing in the Sahara Desert and finding the comb that you dropped in high school.

I checked in for my marathon, and then put two-and-two-and-two together:  it was lunchtime, I was hungry, and within Tempe Marketplace was a restaurant that had served me some of the best damn BBQ pork ribs ever, three years prior.  What was the name?  Pink Cadillac?  Cadillac Jones?  Big Dick Cadillac?  Cadillac-Something.  Yelp told me Cadillac Ranch, and I ascended the steps.

Now for some history about Tempe Marketplace.

A few years ago, I attended a commercial real estate lunch where one of its developers spoke.  Apparently the site used to be 150-200 acres of toxicity - landfills and auto salvage yards.  The developers scooped out the dirt, cleaned it, replaced it, and built a series of restaurants and shops that draws people from all over The Valley.  It was, and remains a home-run.  I like and appreciate what they did to an environmental disaster.

Back to the ribs!  It was a beautifully sunny day, and I sat on the balcony overlooking the scenic courtyard.  I didn't think that the P.A. system would bother me.  I was wrong.

I got a Papago Brewing \"Orange Blossom\" beer, which is a locally-brewed lager with an orange flavor.  It's very good - kind of a like a Heifeweizen after you squeeze an orange in.  I also ordered a full rack of ribs and loaded mashed potatoes.

Amanda, my server, was excellent - cute, polite, prompt, and helpful.  When I asked, she found out where the Orange Blossom was brewed.

The decor is great - it's all wood, and it has a great Old West feel.  Inside the bar is a mechanical bull that drunk wanna-be cowboys get thrown from.  

As I had hoped, the ribs were amazing - perfectly done and fall-off-the-bone tender.  The BBQ sauce is one of my all-time favorites - not too sweet, with a good smoky flavor.  I could have used just a little bit more sauce.

The mashed potatoes were loaded with bacon, green onions, and cheddar cheese.  They were perfect.  I also got french fries, which were spicy and also perfect.  The salad was good and big, although the bleu cheese dressing was a bit watery.

The balcony is a great space to sit and enjoy your food and company.

But the noise!  The P.A. system never stopped blaring to match the action on the giant television screen in the courtyard.  Music occasionally played, but the music-to-commercial ratio is about 1/3 to 2/3.  Good songs by Maroon 5, Lenka, and Katy Perry were cut off after twenty seconds, and a Charmin toilet paper commercial took their place.  You know the one with the cute cartoon bears going into the bathroom, wiping their asses with Charmin, and then emerging with smiles?  Yeah - that's what I had to see and hear during lunch. 

In other words, the P.A. system is not providing music for ambiance;  it's simply another advertising revenue stream.  When advertising detracts from the shopping or dining experience of the customers, the Landlords should revise their plan and eliminate it.

So, when the P.A. system is not the fault of Cadillac Ranch, why do I mention it?  Because it's hurting Cadillac Ranch.  The commercials are annoying and they detract from the dining experience.  The noise makes conversation on the balcony difficult.  

The restaurant is a tenant, and they have a lease with the landlord.  Hopefully, the owners of Cadillac Ranch will read this, complain to their landlord that the P.A. system is hurting them, and it will get turned off.  The world would be a better place.

So, the tab for my lunch:  $36 (before tip) for a salad, a full rack of ribs, french fries, cowboy toast, loaded mashed potatoes, and two local micro-brews.  That's a fair and reasonable price.

The restaurant is good and the ribs are so amazing, I may come back the next time I'm in The Valley.  I just have to remember my earplugs.

4 stars (it would have been 5, but for the noise)"}
{"text":"We hit the mall in search of dinner on 9/30, figuring we'd find something cool and casual. We actually hit the jackpot.

The food was pretty good but what blew us away (and earned the 5 stars) was the service. Our waitress was Karyl and she was awesome. She said she'd only been there about a week but it sure didn't seem like it. She was great, very personable and attentive. 

If we're ever back in Tempe (and we're there a few times a year), we'll definitely be back...hopefully when she's working."}
{"text":"Cadillac Ranch is a typical American food chain on par with Chili's and Applebee's. Nothing exceptional, but the food meets a quality standard and has nice variety. I wouldn't go out of my way to eat here, nor would I avoid it if I needed a timely meal on my way to the airport."}
{"text":"After some noshing at the Fly, some of the Yelparazzi rolled to Town Square to meet up with our farewell girl, Angela's, friends. They were at Cadillac Ranch....I never thought I'd ever walk in here because this kind of place is everything I'm not, but I'm up for an adventure. Some of those \"not my scene\" places have changed my mind before, but this visit solidifies why I didn't step in here on my own volition. 

It was half off drinks so decided to grab some libations and from advice of people who've been- we skipped out on food. I got a Leguntas IPA off the draft and it was bad. I know that this was either old or the keg wasn't properly cared for because I know what this beer is supposed to taste like on tap. This was off. This place isn't really a crowd that is ordering much of the IPA's and the Lagers so they probably sit while the \"Lites\" are getting switched out like hotcakes. Even so, staff should watch the kegs more carefully and drain pour old stuff as needed. I was impressed when I saw something not typical Bud/Miller/Coors on the tap so it made my disappointment worse when it couldn't even be fresh. I didn't complain because it was 3 dollars and we already sent back some incorrect black and tans. 

Some of our party wanted a \"black and tan\" with Guinness and Sam Adams Boston Lager.....waitress didn't know what this was so when it came mixed instead of split, it made us think that they poured it from the draft and not properly spooned in to separate the beers. Someone later came and said that the weights aren't correct to do the split and gave them a \"Black and Blue\" (Guinness and Blue Moon) instead. Though we couldn't dispute the weight issue at the time, I later got researching. Guinness with Sam Adams does indeed exist as a \"Patriot Pint\"....I am waiting on a beeradvocate answers if this indeed is split or is blended together. 

We didn't know it was a Band Battle on the locals night so it was way too loud to talk inside. We are talkative folks so it dampened things. Sorry Vegas, but talent isn't up to par with other big cities so I didn't care to stick around. The band playing sounded alright, but made some major sound errors and were pulling out their sounds, ripoff, not inspired by people who came before them. One being an ex (I'll never tell), so I know well when people are arranging their music like his. 

Yeah, I'm an asshole for saying so, but I'm an asshole with a music collection sitting at home that literally enough to open a music store, a music set up and friends in high places in the industry. Until some quality band (Panic does not count because they don't know how to play live) out here makes it big time, then anyone bitching at me how wonderful the local scene is wrong.  Scenesters, go cry to your Edward Sharpe album and if you see their drummer, Josh, tell him he owes Jade (me) some bubble bath bombs. Enjoy music by all means as it is the greatest mediums in the world, but don't try to convince me out of things I know to be true.  

After 30 minutes of attempting to yell a conversation and half drunk beers, we went downstairs to the Yardhouse for some serious brews from well cared for taps. 

Sorry, but this place isn't the kind of bull I like to be riding this late at night."}
{"text":"I am amazed that this place only has 2 and a half stars. I love this place. They do have the best happy hour around. The bartenders pour great drinks, the wait staff is on it and the food is great! I regular this place for many reasons. The people that work here is one on the main reasons. They are fun and sociable. Treat people the way you want to be treated. I really hate to think some one would pass on cadillac ranch because of some of these bitter reviews. Don't believe everything you read, give it a try for yourself and then you decide. I did and I love it!"}
{"text":"First time visitors here and we won't be returning to this location ever again. 
We opted to sit in the bar area because there was a 40 minute wait, yet there were numerous open tables. 
1. Our waitress either had too many tables that she couldn't handle or she should look for a new job. She was there to take our order and came back quickly when it was time pay but other than that she was rarely seen throughout the meal. We had to ask her and other wait staff to clear dishes from our table on numerous occasions. 
2. The food was not impressive. The lobster bisque was barely warm and extremely runny. It was more like a broth instead of a soup. I ordered it with extra crackers and by the time they were finally delivered, the soup was cold. The thousand island dressing tastes funny, sorta like it has ranch in it. The shrimp tacos were also barely warm but the steaks and kids grilled chicken were sizzling hot. 
3. We ordered the kids brownie sundae for the 2 kids at our table to split. It took an extremely long time for it to come out and when it was finally placed on the table, the aluminum dish that the brownie came in was so hot that it burned my fingers to touch it. Why would you ever serve a child ANYTHING that was scorching hot?

$180 for 4 adults and 2 children under 4 for just mediocre food is absolutely ridiculous if you ask me."}
{"text":"Eh, this place is alright. I only check it out on a sunday night to watch that Islander local band play classic R&B hits in acoustic guitar.  Gotta give it up though, they're pretty good.  This place is pretty much empty on this day with Blue Martini taking up most of the crowd in this spot.  Wish the drinks were half off but I always seem to miss happy hours by just minutes since it ends at midnight.  Good calamari though, give t a try when you're here.

Fridays and Saturdays attracts more crowd but I've never been inside to see how its like. When I'm here on a Saturday in Town Square, I always choose Blue M over this place.

How come no one ever rides the bull?"}
{"text":"A group of 4 of us ladies visited here on Saturday, July 3 at 7PM.  I ordered the steak salad for $13.95 (pretty pricey) and asked for the steak medium.  The steak came way overcooked, the edges were black and the meat was hard.  Upon returning the steak I received a new one which was still well done and not medium the way I ordered.  BTW the steak comes sliced on the plate so the cooks and the waitress should have easily seen how well done it was.  

If that was our only issue I would probably be okay but there is more.  

The service was terrible!  Our server was \"Nikki J.\"  She ignored us throughout our entire meal.  I needed more dressing for my salad but she was no where to be found.  My friend had some that she shared with me.  When the waitress finally returned after our meals were complete she asked if we wanted any dessert.  We ordered more cocktails and my friend ordered a coffee.  When she brought our drinks she also brought our checks.  Did we ask for our checks???  No.  Did we look like we were even close to being done??  No.  The coffee was terrible, old and cold.  Did the waitress ever come back and check on us or notice that the coffee was not touched?? No.  Remember she had already brought us our checks.  After at least a half hour we paid our bills.  Did the waitress ask us if we needed anything else?  No.  We would have ordered more drinks.  My one friend had to ask for a refill of her iced tea.  She brought us our receipts to sign and after about another half hour she returned and asked if she could take our receipts.  It was clear that she getting ready to go home.  We weren't!!!  Still no one asked if we needed anything.  Shortly thereafter we saw our waitress leave.

Three of us still stayed until after 1AM.  Still sitting at the same table.  Still with no one waiting on us.  At one point we went up to the bar to order more drinks and then returned to the table.  There were other waitresses around waiting on other tables but not ours.

After our waitress left we were discussing how we should speak to a manager.  Do you think we ever saw one?  No.

We were there from 7PM until after 1AM and we had a total of 3 drinks, one of which we had to go up to the bar and get ourselves.  And these were $6.54 martinis!!  You think someone would have wanted to wait on us??"}
{"text":"One time visit last night.

Waitress was Sonny.  Excellent in all respects; managed many tables without a hitch.  And split the bill on our large party which was very helpful.  Food, everyone said they liked theirs.  Mine was the flatbread house pizza.  Flatbreads have near zero tolerance on time/temperature.  Mine was done perfectly.  Watering -- fine; drink refreshment -- fine.  Layout, wide and varied.  Dozens of big screen tv's -- located in a major shopping mall area.  Put in a live band and they would rock (so to speak).

Prices in line with chains in the area.  

What caught my attention was the communication about a chardonnay that was ordered; the waitress said, I think it is a cut above \"house brands,\" but if you do not like it, we'll find something else for you.  No fuss, no eye rolling, just a service establishment courtesy.  Sonny was a welcome respite from the \"oh so many\" folk who know nothing about helping people enjoy an evening out.

And as a sports bar it has \"pods\" of TV's -- perhaps over 24!  (true).

f8 and be there"}
{"text":"I don't know how I ended up at this place. I blame in on serious hunger-starved delusions that the Caddy Ranch may have changed for the better since my last visit.  

The food is mediocre and kind of overpriced for the fare. If you're looking to Caddy it up on the cheap, check out the lunch specials on the weekend or the happy hour deals during the week. If you discount the tchotchke TGI-Chili-Bee's atmosphere, it can be a pretty decent happy hour or football destination if that's your bag.

The appetizer sampler is on par for bar food and a pretty good deal for the price. The sliders are disappointing in terms of size and flavor, but the fries they come with are pretty tasty. Onion rings are grease-heavy and came out cold. Whatevs. The food really isn't the issue I have with this place. It's probably a two stars for the food alone, \"Meh. I've experienced better.\"

What pushes this into the dud pile: Crap wait staff that doesn't seem to give a flying rats ass about your table. Straight up grody cocktail combinations that left us feeling like we were about to go into a sugar coma. The seedy vibe at the nightclub coupled with a cover to get in. And the fact that the mechanical bull is like, never on. The night life is really a little slice of the West Side in Tempe. As a reformed G-town resident, I really need to keep away or risk slipping back into my trash person ways.

Nyet. Nyet. Nyet. Three strikes and you're out, Caddy."}
{"text":"Came here for a dinner party with work. Service was great, no complaints there. I feel like the food was just blah. Nothing special. Seems like they just tried to dump a bunch of butter and too much salt on everything to make it good. Nothing special, not worth the price. Probably won't be back."}
{"text":"Possibly the worse food in Tempe. Don't let the unwashed Cadillac and fancy tv screens trick you into assuming the food will be good.

I made the mistake once on my own, but the second time was due to a stubborn tourist relative who by looking at the outside just knew the place had to be amazing.

The first time I ordered a burger and chili cheese fries. The burger was something I would expect from a hospital and the chili served on top of the fries had cinnamon in it,... who the hell wants that in their chili? I didnt realize chili cheese fries was a dessert item.

The second time I was practically dragged into the place. I decided I would order a cheese-steak sandwich which was a huge mistake. The bread was disgusting and the meat was third class. I couldn't finish half of it.

The service was absolutely ridiculous. Funny thing is that I was sitting there for about 40 minutes waiting on the waitress. I finally grew impatient as my wife turned to me in pain and said she thought she was having contractions (she was 9 mos pregnant at the time).

I got up and had to bark at the waitress to ring me up and give me my card so we could leave. We actually ended up going to the hospital that night and had our baby that morning. I always joked about the long stairway up being what started her labor."}
{"text":"Last night my husband and I drove to town square to hit up our new favorite place - Cana. When we walked up to Cana we were told it was closed for a private event. BUMMER.

We considered all the options in Town Square. It was 6:30 PM , so too late for Yardhouse happy hour (btw, screw You Yardhouse and your 3-6 PM HH!), not in the mood for Blue martini.. hmmm.. why not try something new! 

I honestly wasn't thrilled with my husbands choice. It looked pretty lame, and the food menu wasn't exciting me. HOWEVER, Happy hour ends at 8 PM there (big plus!), and I was curious. 

I have to admit, for the type of place it was (cheesy, corporate, western themed, slutty bartenders, all the things I hate!), I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the food and drink prices. 

We had Blue Moons and Pear Ciders ($3/pint), and tried the Nachos, Chicken Lettuce Wraps, and the Ahi Tuna ($7 each). 

My husband declared the Nachos the best restaurant nachos ever (ok apparently he's easy to please?).

Chicken lettuce wraps was different cause the chicken was fried. And dipped in Sesame. And awesome. The lettuce and fried wontons the glorious chicken was served with seemed gratuitous and we didn't eat that. However we loved the chicken. Freaking awesome little fried nuggets of sesame goodness! 

Tuna was a pleasant surprise. I would say it's comparable to what I usually get at Yardhouse (Ahi Tuna crunch salad), but it had peanuts in the salad, a creamier (ie less healthy) dressing, and the tuna had a nice ponzu on it. The serving was smallish- but very similar in size to Yardhouse. 

As mentioned above, the bartenders were particularly plastic and slutty looking. They acted particularly unprofessionally (gossiping loudly amongst themselves the entire time we were there!), but that's all to be expected in a corporate cheese-ball Vegas place. 

Overall I guess what I'm saying is this place isn't all that bad if you're ever stuck here like I was. Food is surprisingly good (for corporate bar food!), and the drink prices are reasonable during HH."}

{"text":"This was easily the top five happy hours I've been to this year. Not only were we seated right away on a busy Friday afternoon, but our servers were quick with drinks and the food came out fast and hot.

Get the chicken quesadilla, it's only 5 bucks and is sure to make your tummy and wallet smile."}

I honestly don't even remember what I have eaten on either occasion that I was there, just remember thinking that I could have probably had better at some of those other chains that I shall not mention. 

The service sucked, and the staff always seem to be in a mood.

The best thing about this place is honestly the drinks. Long Islands for the win!"}
{"text":"Its alright but I would rather visit other establishments at Tempe Marketplace.  I don't even know where to start with the service.  Usually the service sucks and no one pays attention to you.  Or the server is in a hurry to get out.  The last time I paid a visit to this place was after the movies.  I wanted to get some drinks with friends and maybe some foods.  The server was attentive to the point where she was trying to rush us out.  She finally told us that she was done for the night and wanted us to cash out.  We wanted to continue drinking but this girl ended our night at Cadillac and we took our business else where.  I have worked in the restaurant business before and I know you can transfer tables to another server without driving the customer away.  I have never had a good experience when I come here.  When I do stop for a visit, my expectations are very low."}
{"text":"It's an ok place but it used to be much better.  The service is hit or miss, and the food had gone down hill big time!  We used to come here a lot but after a few bad experiences with the food, we avoided Cadillac Ranch for about a year.  Last night we decided to give it another try and it was bad again.  I had the fish and chips, something that used to be good here, but it was so disappointing.  The fish was burnt and the fries were cold.  I gave them another chance, but after last night I won't be back."}
{"text":"Service is never the best here, but they have good clean flank salad & great happy hour prices. Martinis smaller, but for $5 you can have two! Great Queso dip that is half off until 7.  Great patio if you can tolerate smokers & or music playing on stage. When it's good it's good, but when it's bad it's BAD!"}
{"text":"This the second time I've eaten here. Both times the food was good. The blues band that was there was really good. I also liked the 1/2 price drinks.

The first time the service was good. The second time we came for lunch and they only had a bartender doing drinks and waiting tables. She was not overly friendly and seemed to take a long time since there were only two tables.

I would recommend giving this place a try. Maybe for dinner not lunch."}
{"text":"First time visiting this restaurant while visiting Pittsburgh. There's a pretty cool sports bar with tons of TVs and quite a bit of people at the bar! Have a nice happy hour from 5 to 7 which included discounted appetizers and drinks. I loved the blackened mini fish tacos and only $6 during happy hour. I also ordered a a flatbread which was okay but a lot larger than I expected. Once again not bad for $6 during happy hour. not a great selection of wines however their house wines are only $3 during happy hour silent with that. Excellent service by multiple people making sure I was at end of two at the bar!"}
{"text":"SERVICE
Stumbled upon this place while shopping in Tempe Marketplace.  We went to dinner around 5 on a Saturday so it was not crowded at all.  That being said, to echo others, the service was pretty bad when there was really no reason for it to be so.  Ordered a salad and was not asked what dressing I wanted so I assumed it was already dressed.  Salad was served with no dressing and could not flag down a server to get dressing for about 10 minutes.  I sat there and made my companions all feel to awkward to eat because I couldn't eat the salad without dressing (literally, dry as a bone).   It was generally hard to get our server to our table and when we managed, he seemed irritated.  

MENU
Largely overpriced.  It's bar food with a little extra but at dinner prices.  My companion had the Sliders which were unremarkable but the beef was of relatively good quality.  
I ordered the Chop Shop cobb which was again, overpriced (aprox $12 for something a bit larger than a dinner salad) which was fresh and had some good produce (although my avocado was not ripe) but again, not dressed and sort of boring in the end.  
Diversity was lacking- a small selection of pretty generic offerings.  

CLEANLINESS/OVERALL QUALITY
This is going to gross some people out but I was given a straw without a wrapper on it and when I put it in my mouth, it was salty... as though someone had stuck a sweaty/dirty hand into a bin of straws.  My dinner companion had the exact same experience.  We were both really unnerved and grossed out.  

ATMOSPHERE
It's brand new so the facilities are generally clean and well kept but the atmosphere is ridiculous.  It's sort of Texas Roadhouse meets Coyote Ugly and neither work very well.  There's just something awkward about trying to eat dinner with a mechanical bull beside you."}
{"text":"Service is pretty bad here.  Second time I've come here to sit at the bar and be ignored.   Frank the bartender barely got me what I wanted without flagging him down.   Bar was practically empty at 7 pm while rest of Settlers Ridge packed.  Bartenders more interested in talking to each other.  
When asking about food bartender's answers were 'ok' for chicken philly and \"if you aren't that hungry it's small\" for the brisket sandwich.  
Last time I'll go in there.  Really should give one star but the beer was cold."}
{"text":"Food - 4 stars- We had some really tasty burger sliders and pulled pork sliders. The homemade chips were delicious albeit heavy.

Service - 1 star- Although our waitress was as sweet as pie, the time it took for her to bring our drinks and foods was inexcusable. We also had a 20 minute wait to get seated when there were literally 10 people in the restaurant. 

Atmosphere - 3 stars- I could imagine that the place might be jumpin at night but we were there for lunch and it was DEAD. The mechanical bull is a nice touch though.

If it weren't for a groupon I wouldn't have ever ventured into this place considering Blue Martini and Yard House are close by. It's also pricey, which I wouldn't mind if everything else was up to par."}
{"text":"Everyone who has tried the pork chops, keeps coming back for them. They are amazing! The atmosphere is also great."}
{"text":"Walked in to a hostess on the phone for so long I eventually just sat down in the bar at a high top. Waited 10 mins and literally no one came to take an order. Left. Why I thought it would be any different than every other time is beyond me. DONE. Worst service ever."}
{"text":"stopped in on sunday for some drinks and to watch the la lakers vs celtics game.  i was surprised about the bad reviews at the Cadillac ranch. everything that was being served looked tasty and i thought our server was pleasant & attentive.

we were more thirsty than hungry.  i ordered two rieslings and Mr H  ordered two beers. we shared a basket of fries with ranch dressing...the fries were hot & yummy.
 
CR is a good place to take a break from the strip.  the only reason that I'm not giving it 4 stars is because i did not sample any of the entrees."}
{"text":"I've never had a bad experience here but sometimes it's super busy and takes a while to get a seat. I like the country atmosphere and the music they play. Their food is also really good! I usually get a salad and they are very large. Their alcoholic drinks are also very unique and delicious."}
{"text":"we were drawn in by the appearance and the music coming from this place as we were walking by so we decided to give it a shot. Overall it was alright, nothing i think i will be craving anytime soon. Drinks were okay..food the same. food seemed really heavy and not on the very healthy side..which i prefer. one really good thing here was our waitress she was awesome, but other than that this place did not really knock my socks off."}
{"text":"Don't listen to the other reviews.  I have been here many times and every time it is awesome.  Will be back for sure."}
{"text":"This is the third time we have been here the past year.  The chicken diablo and ribs are always good.  The hostess told us we would have to wait for the outside covered seating.  When we informed her there was an open table she smiled, thanked us and told us she would have a busboy clean it off right away.  Our adorable waitress, Mallory had the chef come out to discuss gluten free options with one member of our party.  This 20 something young man was very attentive and not inconvenienced in the least.  The nachos turned out to be a great option.  My chicken option was tasty.  I am not sure where the negative reviews have come from.  We have had three good experiences."}
{"text":"Food selection was OK. The atomosphere and decor is really cool and different. Not much on the menu for healthy eaters. It is more of a steak and potatoes (American) kind of place. I went there because it was one of only 2 places to eat in settler's ridge using the Entertainment book."}
{"text":"My husband and I were going to the movies and with his foot in a cast boot our lunch options were limited. It has been years since I've been to this place and has it ever changed. Gone is the mechanical bull ride. Another type of game off in the corner has taken its place. Even the rest rooms have changed-the stalls are painted black along with black toilets.

The place was fairly empty and we pretty much had the whole place to ourselves. They do offer one perk-If you are going to the movies that day or have seen a movie and have the stub then they will give you one entree at half price as long as you purchase one at regular price. Fortunately I had our tickets on my phone so she accepted that as our coupon.

My husband had a barbecue chicken tossed salad. I went with the French onion burger. Instead of paying the up charge for sweet potato fries I asked substitute broccoli for the regular fries. I ordered medium well but I guess I should have had it well done because I'm no fan of seeing \"pink\" in the middle. The burger was okay-nothing to write home about. They do give you a good size of broccoli which was filling.

Seemed like it took a long time to get our drinks replenished but the waitress finally did. Place is a bit pricey for the food but the coupon helped soften the blow. Made for an easy walk to the theater so my husband could rest his foot."}
{"text":"Today I went shopping at  Settlers  Ridge 
All was good I  decided to stop over at  Cadillac
Ranch for a cocktail after shopping. 
I went to the 1st bar just inside of the door
I stood there 4 25 mins I timed it on my cell
B4 someone came over to asked if I would care 4a drink. This is not the first time this has happen to me at this same establishment.
4 bartenders walked in front of me, looked at me 
But did not ask if I care 4 a drink or anything.
  I literally looked into the eyes of one bar bartender and she finally came over and asked me what would I like after 30 minutes this is Poor customer service."}
{"text":"Another enigma in Pittsburgh dining. Why does a place called Cadillac Ranch come with a country western theme? Why does it have a bull ride off to one side? Why do they remove the tables for a certain area and have line dancing? Blah

What does Cadillac Ranch have? Bad food, Highly caloric bad food. With my trusty smart phone in hand, I went to their websight, looked up the nutritional guide and not one thing on the dinner menu had anything healthy. Mac & Cheese with blackened chicken: 3500 calories and over 120 grams of fat. Luckily, beer is vegan. myself and friend of Joe named Jamie (also fellow vegan friend of Joe, Jamie) went in here one night after having a wonderful dinner at nearby, Loving Hut (Read my Review!) and stopped by the Barnes and Noble next door. I remembered the Buccos were playing and I said to Jamie, Let's stop at Cadillac Ranch and have a cold one.

Buccos blew the game in the sixth when we sat down, I sat in front of the taps and saw Stone IPA, mouth already watering I ordered one. Extended happy hour? My beer was only three bucks, and that was a full pint. Good deal. Jamie had a wheat beer that i never caught the name of, the guy always goes for the wheat.

As it goes, they had a duo playing guitars on the patio mostly cover Black Crows tunes, the crowd seemed to enjoy them. I watched the big screens behind the bar and enjoyed people watching. The frat boys on my other side ordered wings that looked pretty good. Nice and meaty, pretty good size, more of the meaty wing joint than the \"other\" part of the wing. Probably 8 or ten in an order. The place was packed. 

So I gave you the good with the bad, I'll leave it up to you to decide your own fate."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like Cadillac Ranch, As I walked in I thought \"I could drink a few here.\" I sat at the bar and waited..
and waited
and waited
FINALLY a hot blond girl took my order, a simple beer
and walked away. 
There I sat. No beer, no menu, hot girl attitude ALL over me.

Finally got my beer 10 minutes later. Not even a \"sorry\"

STILL no menu.
Got up and left

This place SUCKS!"}
{"text":"I had dinner with some co-workers here last week.  This seems to be a good place to grab a few beers, watch sports and or ride the mechanical bull.  However,  I am not sure I understand the décor as I can't tie the theme together in my mind.  With respect to the food, I would not eat here again.  We had a large group so the $5 appetizers were popular because we knew our entrees would take awhile.   The sweet n spicy calamari was okay but they smothered it in sauce leaving the breading soggy.  I had their sirloin steak with green beans and mashed potatoes. The steak didn't have much flavor so the demi sauce that came with it was quickly used up.  The pile of green beans was limp and the mashed potatoes had too much white pepper in them.  The dinner was so unimpressive; I did not finish it and came home for a Pb & J.  I was also confused by why they have an attendant in the men's room.  So, I don't have a buzz, didn't enjoy my dinner and now I feel like I have to tip a guy for handing me a couple of c-fold towels.  I don't plan on being back on the ranch anytime soon.  I would give them a one star rating but the girl who waited on our group did a good job."}
{"text":"Love their bbq chicken salad, other than that, food isn't bad. Good local place to go to, a bit expensive."}
{"text":"The beer is good thats about it ! Cant find a waitress for your life ! Food well needs some help !"}
{"text":"Alright to hang out once in a while, music is alright only because they actually play a variety of different bands, staff is friendly, drinks are good, haven't tried the food yet, but who needs food when there's beer"}
{"text":"Excellent service, food, and drinks. This place should be first on the list to all who visit this area. I recommend the filet mignon and ahi tuna. The folks here make you feel right at home and the ambience is welcoming. Give it a try and have a good time!"}
{"text":"First of all, I'm out to have a good time on my birthday. The id checker told me that my birthday was yesterday even though it was 11 pm on my actual birthday. Then we get in and the bartender (male) looks over at the female bartender and goes, \"are you going to get them?\" to which she rudely replies, \"no you get them\". 

Everyone was rude from the get go. We just went to check them out. I give good reviews where ever I go. But I felt bombarded with rudeness and hated it. We walked out in less than 5 minutes. Don't do it!"}
{"text":"I came to Cadillac Ranch on a Friday evening to celebrate with a friend who just eloped in Las Vegas!  I met his lovely new bride on the patio of Cadillac Ranch, which sits above the people shopping below at Tempe Marketplace.  People were smoking, which somewhat irritated my allergies, but I can't complain, since it's technically outdoors.  When I asked the young, energetic bartender what the specials were during happy hour, she happily recited a long list of bargains including domestic and imported beers, wine, margaritas and cocktails!  The prices were fair and average for a happy hour at Tempe Marketplace.  We also ordered chips and salsa to snack on with our beverages.  The chips were fresh and tasty, as was the flavorful salsa.  The appetizer also came with a small bowl of warm queso cheese with some meat crumbles sprinkled on top.  I cheated on my vegan-ism and scooped some cheese onto a chip...yum!  It was pretty good!  Overall I was impressed with the prompt service, knowledgeable staff and open environment.  It was the perfect evening to catch a breeze and watch the crowd below, while enjoying good company and good food at a perfectly good bar."}
{"text":"Yuck!

This is what happens when you have to choose between a trip to Target in the burbs and a good restaurant in the city.  The good restaurant lost out for tonight.  

I got the A-1 mushroom burger.  My first mistake.  After having the great burgh burger tour of 2011 in process, this burger didn't stand a chance!  It was....bleck!

The A-1 sauce was just dripping in mass amounts off the burger.  I love me some sauce, but this was obviously to overcompensate for the lack of taste in the patty.  The meat was just blah.  It was the strangest thing!  It looked like meat and felt like meat, but there was absolutely no taste!  And to top off the icky burger was the limp fries.  NO ONE wants a limp fry...am I right ladies (and men of course!)?  

My hubs got the ribs and I quote him....\"they were less than ok.\"  That pretty much sums up the whole place.  Less than ok and not even worth the one star.  Boo!"}
{"text":"Went there for my son's birthday. We were pretty excited, heard the food was good and could not wait to eat. The website says their happy hour is thought the restaurant. When we got sat the server said we could only get happy hour in the bar and there were no seats available in there. The food was awful. He got a full rack of ribs and said Applebees ribs are better! That's crazy since there ribs are microwaved. He had wings as an appetizer and couldn't even eat them they were that bad. I had the salmon with green beans and mashed potatoes it was ok, nothing to rave about. None the less we paid over 100.00 for bad food, bad service. I'll never go back."}
{"text":"This is a decent spot if you are into larger venues and chain restaurants. (I'm not sure this is actually a chain, but it definitely has the look and feel of one.) The food is good enough (again - typical chain restaurant food), although it took quite a while for it to come out. All in all, this is not my kind of spot but it is convenient and I love the huge outdoor patio."}
{"text":"Came here last night with a friend who was in town. I didn't want to go thru the hassle of going to a club on the strip, and I've seen this place before in passing, so this was the pick of the night. We got there a little early (around 10) so there was no line. There was also no cover which was nice and it didn't look like there was any dress code, but most people looked decent which kept the respectability of the place. There a several bars, A BUNCH of tv's always on a sports game/espn (ya!) and a mechanical bull, which is always fun to watch. I didn't eat the food, and from the others reviewers of this place, i don't think i ever will. The prices for drink were a little on the expensive side so I'm pre-partying next time. A few dance floors, DJ, bottle service (from what I was told) was about $200, which is pretty good. Alot of cougars last night. I mean ALOT. bachelor parties, and whatever else you can think of. definitely a diverse crowd. 

Truth be told the only reason I didn't give this place 5 stars is because somewhere in the back of my mind, I keep thinking about how this place reminds me of a more classy version of saddle ranch at citywalk in Hollywood (which is not a good look). Its a little off the strip, so if you get tired of dealing with the politics of place on the strip and wanna go for something different, this is your place."}
{"text":"I wished I would have yelped this before I went to eat here.

This a yee haw type of restaurant...it has interesting decorations and big screen tvs.

I had a chicken sandwhich that was dry and it didn't have a lot of flavors.  The one good thing I ate was the fries.  The onion rings weren't that good.

Even though I only had one thing and didn't like it, I wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"Had a great time with some co-workers at Cadillac ranch. Sampled the happy hour menu liberally and couldn't find anything bad. It was a bit difficult to find seating the later it got, but the service was always quick despite the crowd. 

It looked like they have pong nights, trivia and live bands. Can't say I caught the schedule, but all in all seemed to be a fun place to unwind."}
{"text":"I don't even know where to start. I'm fairly sure that this was the most atrocious experience I've ever had at a restaurant. 

At the bar, we were informed they were out of Bud Light. So my husband ordered another beer on tap. When the bartender placed it in front of him, the top was all foam. My husband politely asked the other bartender if she could top it off for him. She said, \"Sorry, we have a one inch foam policy.\" We thought she was joking. When she just stared at us, he said, \"Wait, are you serious?\" \"Yeah,\" she said. \"I'm backing him up. That's our policy.\" WTF?! Our friend took out his phone and measured the beer with a ruler app. After the foam went down, the beer was an inch and a half below the rim of the glass. That's their policy?

We were with a party of 40 for a wedding reception. They had lost our reservation, but it was dead so it didn't really matter. We were put outside on the patio. It would have been perfect, had we received any service. Any service at all. Not ONCE did a single employee come out to ask if we needed drinks, take our order, see if we needed anything, etc. The only people that had drinks were those of us that had ordered them from the bar inside. When the mother of the groom went inside to ask for service, she overheard a waitress tell a bartender, \"I was JUST out there.\" Yeah, she was just out there, yet 3/4 of our party didn't even have water. Even when she came out afterward, she simply came to remove a glass, and was walking away when I stopped her to ask if she could please get some of us water since we had literally been there for 45 minutes and had nothing. 

Some people ordered appetizers from the bar because they couldn't take it anymore. They were also out of 4 appetizers that were on the menu. When the bartender came to deliver them outside, he said they were out of ranch dressing. I wondered aloud how a place could be out of Bud Light, ranch, and 4 different appetizers... He replied, \"Oh, we're closing down. This is probably going to be our last night in business.\" Yup, he said he was dead serious. Now it all made sense. This was their last night open and none of the employees gave a sh*t. 

As the night went on, we learned that they DID in fact have Bud Light. It was in bottles, yet it was never offered when we tried to order it. They also had blue cheese dressing and chipotle ranch dressing, both of which were never offered when we asked for ranch. The parents of the bride had to go inside to order appetizers for everyone. Employees only came outside to deliver our food and take away empty plates. We were all left to our own devices if we needed anything else, whether it was water or napkins. All 40 of us were COMPLETELY ignored. 

There was one bartender who was very nice. When we mentioned that we learned this was their last night in business he said, \"Where did you hear that? We're closing down, but not for a few more weeks.\" So the other guy just lied? 

This place had such great potential. The atmosphere was very House of Blues-ish. I liked it when I first walked in. Now all I can say is, I TOTALLY understand why they're going out of business. They don't value their customers at all."}
{"text":"NO EFFIN WAY!

it was my friends birthday and we were barhopping tempe marketplace. we waited on the stairs to get in line to this place (and in heels that totally sucked!) finally once we reach the top us ladies are first, we all paid our cover to get in and then the boys were following.

now mind you we're all \"rock n rollers\", yes, im 25 years old and i wear a studded belt and a padlock necklace. i have for years (as seen in my pictures i never take the thing off). my guy friend that has same padlock necklace was told to take it off because it could be a weapon. really? i JUST got in and im wearing the SAME dang thing. you cant take it off without a key. which fortunately we did not have. they also wanted him to take off his belt as well.  we all took back the cover and went elseware.

way to stereotype. jerks."}
{"text":"I'll give it 2 stars for the drinks at the bar and patio. My husband and I ate here once for dinner and it was ok.  Nothing special.  What happened afterward was the bad part. I am usually the one with the stomach problems, but after our dinner at Cadillac Ranch my husband was up all night with issues. The \"issues\" were so bad that he required a trip to the ER the next day for fluids. We have never gone back for food. I have heard many stories of other people getting sick after eating here.  

Be warned."}
{"text":"I had high hopes for this place (maybe because I hadn't read the reviews yet) but disappointed doesn't even come close. The decor is cool enough but that's where the good points end. My husband and I went for lunch the other day and wont be returning. The server was ok, meaning she just did the bare minimum of service needed for her to be classified as a server. The sad part was there were only a handful of people in there. My husband ordered the sliders and I had the cadilac chicken burger with 50/50 tots and onion rings. Boy were they some sad looking meals. There were 2 small sliders and a small handful of fries and I had what I would classify as a fast food chicken burger but with no condiments (I had to ask for them afterwards). As for the 50/50, I only got 4 onion rings and a small amount of tots. The tots were good but the onion rings very greasy and soggy and the onions were not fresh! They were like the onions on my burger. They were old and dry and I had to \"peel\" the dry skins off before I ate them.

What I loved the most was at the bottom of the bill was a calculation for what a 15%, 20% and 25% tip would be (for our convenience). I wanted to write what a 0% tip would be!!! I love how they just assume they deserve a 15% tip. I am not against tipping(I have been known to leave some very nice tips) but I am against it being expected!

What a waste of $$$$ I would not return even for a coupon!


Added: Nice to see CR was speedy with their reply. NOT! No thank you I will not be returing and have mentioned this review to any who inquire."}
{"text":"The food here is great and really cheap during happy hour. I only gave a 4 star because the cocktails seem really weak."}
{"text":"I had lunch at Cadillac Ranch today. I had the surf and turf , its hardly worth the money. The ny strip was all gristle topped with 5 over cooked shrimp served over home fries you can get from Denny's. I had the brownie with ice cream. While the ice cream was good the brownie was over cooked and hard. We had a large party and had 2 servers. During the hour and a half we were there I only got one refill on my iced tea. I will not be back to eat.... Might want to stick to the over price drinks."}
{"text":"Bought a few Groupons awhile back and recently redeemed them before it expired.  The restaurant is located above the Yard House and next to Blue Martini in Town Square, or next to the Rave Motion Picture Theater.

Price is not bad overall, especially if you consider their $5 appetizers, which is like HH pricing and you can order a lot of different food for a casual get together or while watching whatever game is on (you can request the game you want on the TV).

Service is friendly. Orders does however take awhile to be delivered from the kitchen, at least the 2 times I was there when the restaurant wasn't even busy or at 25% capacity (Sunday at around noon and a Thursday afternoon around 5pm).

Spinach, Artichoke and Jumbo Lump Crab Dip served with Crispy Flatbread was good. At $12.95 it is one of their most expensive appetizers, but you get good portions and the flatbread can get addicting.

The only $5 appetizer I tried and liked was the Avocado Eggroll.  You get 1.5 fried eggrolls filled with creamy avocado, which I think is pricey for what it is, but it is yummy.

The Philly Cheesesteak sandwich is just alright. What you get for $10.95 is huge portion, which can easily feed two people with a normal appetite. Their French Fries is good and you get a lot with the sandwich.

Sirloin Steak and Shrimps - steak was nicely marked, but didn't have much flavor and the Demi Sauce that came with it was quickly used up.  The Tiger Shrimps with the scampi sauce was alright too.  I didn't want the Baked Potatoes side, so my waitress switched it with another side (broccoli).

The dessert I tried was Chocolate Lovin' Spoon Cake.  You get a generous slice of cake, which is moist, but I also don't think they make this in house.

Overall, I think it is a cool place to hang out and grab some food (nothing fancy or super delicious) while catching a game or taking a break from shopping.  I am sure it is a cool place to go to at night for an alternative clubbing experience, but I can't comment on that for lack of personal experience.  I do know that the restaurant is available for private functions, as they held a kid's birthday party in the patio seating area on my first visit, and blocked off 1/4 of the restaurant for a private get together on my second visit.

Decor: 3/5  - can get pretty dark in there, but I like their oversize posters, and there are a lot of TVs with ESPN or some game on pretty much at all times.

Food: 2/5 - Not going to win any James Beard awards, but most people come here for the drink specials and grab food as an afterthought.

Price: 3/5

Service: 4/5 - Friendly.

Location: 4/5 - in the hip locals hangout/shopping/entertainment/dining spot off-Strip.

* Mechanical Bull - has potential and just needs the right combination of a good operator and a hottie with a good kung-fu grip for the ride."}
{"text":"This place is a BBQ/ all- American dining experience. It has mechanical bulls for the brave drunks and it was pretty packed yesterday. I haven't eaten here before; we were going to last night, but then one of my guy friends was in a tee-shirt and they wouldn't let him in. It's a BBQ place for Christ's sake- stop taking yourself so seriously!!"}
{"text":"Service was in training. Food was a burger and onion rings. Onion rings were limp and over greasy and burger was too much bun and over dry. This is the second time that I have tried this establishment and will probably be the last."}
{"text":"This place stinks. The food is like some microwaved frozen crap. I had the fish-n-chips this time, but I've also had the burger (yes, I came back -- it looks so good from the outside, and I always stay at the hotels across the street when I come to Pitt). The beer selection is okay, and the ambiance is okay, too. The service is terrible (but not as bad as Hertz, of course)."}
{"text":"Good outside seating and very slow and less attentive service. They didn't ask for water refill and when we asked, it took them more than 10 minutes to bring us water. Secondly, we asked for a box to take the left over food which they never brought. 

Food is also disappointing. We ordered margherita pizza, spinach artichoke dip and potato chips. The pizza is very bland and unappealing. It had absolutely no flavor. However, I managed to eat 3 slices since  I was very hungry. Even after requesting them to add less toppings to the chips, they loaded our chips with toppings. So, that was a miss too. My friend liked the spinach and artichoke dip, but she never got a box to take the leftover.
 
Overall, very disappointing experience. I don't think I will go back again."}
{"text":"We've been here 6-10 times and it's always been a good experience.  The food is good, the portion sizes are appropriate and the service is good."}
