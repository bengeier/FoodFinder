{"text":"Ordered threw door dash forgot my guac which I paid extra for. 3 dollars for one taco way overpriced. Food is not authentic"}
{"text":"Closed at 7pm on a Wednesday. No posted hours. No voicemail. Horrible, horrible location. I went looking for the food truck last week but didn't find it out in Apache Junction (or nearly Apache junction? I don't know where the line is. Anyway, I can't believe they traded in their truck for this dump. And after two attempts to hit them up for some Sonoran dogs, I'm done. It's 2018 -- most people on planet earth have a cell phone. Get your online presence together!!"}
{"text":"Only ordered from them once, but I'm not impressed. I paid 3 dollars for a small street taco that is expensive in my opinion especially for the bland flavor the salsa doesn't have flavor either. I also ordered a side of guacamole that never showed up. Not ordering from them again"}
