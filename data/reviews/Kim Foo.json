{"text":"Absolutely horrible! Greasiest Chinese food I've ever had. I have never seen vegetables covered in so much oil in my life! Food came out cold. Sign out front said $15.99 and they charged me $17.99 + tax. Do not go! You will regret it!"}
{"text":"I began ordering from Kim Foo for delivery again after a long absence. The eggrolls are nowhere near as good as they used to be. Avoid General Tao Chicken it's not worth it. 

The first time I had their #2 special - that's when I realized the eggrolls aren't as good. The plum sauce is nice. The 3 small pieces of chicken soo guy - long ago there was more, and they at least cut it into nice pieces (the accompanying red sauce was fine). The chicken chow mein had too much sauce in it.

Last Tuesday I ordered their #4 special - first time I had their General Tao Chicken and it will be the last. Nothing like it should be. If you don't know what it should be like, you might like it. The cantonese chow mein had too much sauce.

Otherwise it was fine, as I remembered it. Even though the soo guy was meager, it was done well. 

Both times I had extra eggrolls and they gave enough sauce.

The delivery drivers were polite and nice. The first order arrived in 25 minutes, the second order arrived in 20 minutes.

I realize it's been 2 plus years since I last ordered in from this restaurant, but I remembered how great their eggrolls were and it's a major disappointment now. They should give back a proper amount of soo guy chicken as well and take 5 seconds to cut it nicely.

The chicken fried rice is a half container which is more than enough, properly cooked. The spareribs are as good and tasty as they've always been. Use less sauce in the vegetable dishes, please. Otherwise also cooked well.

Next time I'll try their #3 special and I'll take the almond chicken (it's a choice between that and General Tao which won't happen again).

The prices have gone up since the last time I ordered (I had an old pdf menu) but it's a reasonable increase.

3 stars even though I'm disappointed.

I went to the website to look if their menu had new pricing; the site does not load. I called both their telephone & fax numbers and both don't work.
It appears they've finally shut down."}

{"text":"Zero star!! Terrible restaurant. No food on the trays on a Saturday! There was only one waiter who had to juggle between cutting the roast beef and collecting plates off the tables. We went in a tour group so we had made a reservation for dinner. After I lined up for the roast beef and looked around, there was nothing left on the food trays. There was rice and what looked like soy sauce in rice. Everyone waited for food to be refilled but they were super slow. The steamed fish was quite raw. The desserts table prob only had food for 10 ppl. We were 55 in total. The restaurant had no signs. It was in the underground level. It looked like a make shift location just for our tour group."}
{"text":"While on a weekend retreat in Montreal, we stopped in this buffet due to it's proximity to the Marriott Hotel. We should have reviewed it on YELP first but we took a chance, what can go wrong with Chinese buffet. Everything from food, location, service to damn near the water they served. 

 I wouldn't say they are worth a single star, but YELP wanted to be generous. We got the buffet but no food, the trays were less than half empty. We asked about paying for a buffet and  where was the food, we weren't seeing trays being refilled with food. Our waiter explained , that they are slow and the food would be coming soon, no such thing.  I would take the advise from the \"Tom.B\" who wrote the first review, don't go , terrible. Food wasn't great , service sucked and  they will rip you off!."}
{"text":"Comme les autres yelpeurs l'indiquent, c'est effectivement l'un des mauvais buffets que j'ai pu essayer. Les aliments goûtent presque tous la même chose, on y retrouve quelque fois un petit arrière goût graisseux. Pourtant on voit souvent des gens y prendre un repas. Ce n'est pas le moins cher en ville non plus. On ne s'en sort pas en bas de 15-18 $ par personne. Visuellement, le choix est très impressionnant mais on y retrouve très peu de caractère distinctif, d'un met à l'autre.

Like all the other yelpers say, it's really one of the worse buffet I've been to. The food tastes almost the same with a greasy aftertaste. Although, you will see lots of client during break time hours and meal time. It's not the cheapest place, far from that. The bill might reach around 15-18 $ per person. Visually, it's impressive at first but there's less distinction in your plate than in your eyes, from one meal to another."}
