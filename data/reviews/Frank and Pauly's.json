{"text":"We tried this restaurant on a Saturday night and we were seated right away.  The menu is pretty traditional and the dessert menu is uninspired.  The by-the-glass wine list was short, but reasonably priced-- although it looks like there is wine galore for the more adventurous..  The crusty, white bread came out with a hot center and cold end piece.  Our waitress was okay, but not polished or genuinely friendly.  What makes this restaurant worth mentioning was one of the specials-- grouper with potatoes and a veggie medley.   The meal arrived with a thick slice of fresh, grilled pineapple and delicious sauce.  There was a generous portion fo  grouper that was perfectly cooked.  It almost tasted like lobster.  While some chefs drown the meal in sauce, the sauce was served in a small, side container perfect for dipping the fish, lightly-crispy potato slices, and broccoli.  The broccoli was a little overcooked, but at least the vegetables were all fresh-- green beans, red peppers, and more.  My husband's chicken marsala was served in a deep bowl which kept the food hot throughout the meal.  While my entree got an A, the chicken marsala was a B- at best.  My coffee arrived lukewarm, but the waitress agreed to warm it up in the microwave for me.  When it returned, the saucer was gone.  We settled on the chocolate chip cookies for dessert.  Good, but not home-baked amazing as we'd hoped.  My advice is to give it a try if you're willing to take a chance of the special of the day."}
{"text":"I was hoping for a good Italian restaurant; this is not it. We shared the calamari and it was so chewy I couldn't eat it. The sauce was very bland as well.  I had the Shrimp Oreganata. It was shrimp with breadcrumbs and a white wine sauce. The shrimp were heavily breaded and the crumbs did not have time to have soak up any  flavor from the dish or to brown. Additionally, the dish was VERY bland.  I had iced tea to drink and when the waitress refilled it, she poured in cold coffee - that was a shock to drink...  The service was only okay as well. We marked this place off our list."}
{"text":"The Italian beef sandwich was dry and tasteless.  The waitress barely came by, waited forever.  I won't go back.  Beautiful building, though."}
{"text":"By far the worst food and service!! Don't waste your money! Took 2 bites and the server never even asked if I liked it? I am in the business and never complain but it was so bad I needed to take the time to write this."}
{"text":"Being a fan of Gordon Ramsey's show \"Kitchen Nightmares\", I can't help but try to think what Gordon would say if he came to a particular restaurant. And I'm sad to say, this place would definitely elicit a good ol \"Bloody Hell\" or a \"F*** Me!!\" out of the expletive prone chef's mouth!  The main issue with Frank and Pauly's is that there is a massive disconnect. There is a disconnect between the Building (Old world/old fashiioned and trying to be luxurious), the service (lackadaisical/mediocre), the food (Meh... I could microwave frozen dinners just as good) and the prices (Holy Mackarel! $14 for that ravioli! And $5 for a side salad consisting of a weeny bit of lettuce and blue cheese?!)  Man, Gordon would go to town on this place!  Frank and Pauly's really wants to be the place you go for a nice upscale date. A luxurious evening out in town. Maybe even a place you take your business clients to impress them! It's a historic landmark of the US and beautifully kept! So why do they serve you a menu which feels like it's aimed at kids? And why does everything about the restaurant (not the building, mind you) feel so cheap? The menu feels plasticky, the food is bought out in oversize plates from the 80s and the lighting makes the place look dull and drab.  The food could have been a saving grace, however, it just simply isn't. It's not bad... just not good either.  We had a Shrimp appetizer (was ok.. couldn't really complain about anything except the price - $12 for what seemed to be 6 previously frozen shrimp) followed by a Cheese ravioli in a marinara and a Penne vodka. I could forgive the obviously microwaved frozen ravioli or a boxed penne if the sauces had been amazing. But the marinara tasted like Hunts tomato Puree with some garlic, parsley, onions and salt, while the Vodka simply added some cream, vodka and peppers to that.  All in all, not a place I would go back to!"}
{"text":"One of the worst meals of my life. Half the wine list was not available but we did get plenty of time to drink wine as it took over an hour from the time we ordered to get served. We were a party of 7 and the food came out 2 plates at a time. The first 2 served were done eating before the last person in our party was served. We spoke to the owner and he told us we did not understand what he was dealing with and that he had lost control of the kitchen. DO NOT eat here food that did come out was over cooked and the pasta was cold and portions were very small.  Major disappointment ."}
{"text":"Glad to see Frank and Pauly's back! Food was great, atmosphere good and our waitress (Amanda) was superb. It's was refreshing to be treated well and have a great meal at the same time. I highly recommend Frank and Pauly's."}
{"text":"i used my groupon deal:  $40 worth of food for only $19 for 2 full course meals!  everything was made from scratch:  pasta, bread, soup, parmesan cheese, meatballs, zuccini, and gelato for dessert.  the atmosphere is gorgeous with lots of wood and windows.  the attitude of all the personell was outstanding and accomodating."}
{"text":"I have heard great things about this restaurant.  I have even eaten there when it was downtown and it was much better.  Now I would not recommend it.  You can do much better for the price (ie Maggiano's).  My wife and I were sat at a table at the end of an isle against a small wall.  It was a horrible table.  Terrible shadows  draped the area and we felt cramped and uncomfortable.  We asked to be moved and they happily obliged.  We sat in a nice 1/2 booth against the wall in the corner.  MUCH better.    The service was slow but friendly.  She was the kind of waitress that would never be caught up, no matter how few tables she had.  She brought out our calamari appetizer quickly and with a basket of bread and butter.  The calamari was crispy and tasty, but salty.  The marinara sauce was good too.  The bread was fantastic along with the whipped heavily salted butter.  Some of the best bread I've had in a long time.  The bread and butter was by far the highlight of the evening.  I had the shrimp oreganata.  Basically shrimp baked with homemade breadcrumbs with a side of pasta with olive oil.  The pasta was over cooked.  I expect it al dente.  It wasn't.  The breadcrumbs held too much oil so it made them greasy.  The whole plate was way over salted.  My wife had the fish of the day.  It was a sole filet served over wild rice with a buttery sauce topping.  She also ordered a side of sauteed \"wild\" mushrooms.  The fish was cooked properly and, for the most part good.  It too was overly salty.  Salt seemed to be the theme of the evening.  The \"wild\" mushrooms turned out to be normal old button mushrooms.  Nothing wild about these.  Also too salty.  The total was $88 including tax (we also had a glass of wine each) plus $17 tip for a grand total of $105.  If we had went to Maggiano's we probably would have cost us $20 less and we would have had a better meal with better service. Plus we would have had leftovers for the next two days."}
{"text":"Over the past few weeks, my wife I talked about trying Frank & Pauley's and had high hopes.  Unfortunately, as soon we walked in, we were turned off.  The employees looked very confused and not inviting. This isn't a huge deal for me but it set the tone for our visit.  Next we detected a strong odor.  It was a heavy, musty smell that as we waited to be greeted, we decided it could not be ignored.  That coupled with the high humidity convinced us it would not be a comfortable setting for the evening.  We decided to leave, which is a shame because I still don't know what their food tastes like.  Maybe we'll get carryout sometime."}
{"text":"Considering how many reviews this restaurant has on another review site, I'm surprised to be the first Yelper to review the new Frank and Pauly's.  Located in a historic house on Mentor Avenue, Frank and Pauly's sits where many failed restaurants have previously existed.  I'm generally a fan of historic anything, but the interior seemed kind of generic to me.  Very old school/traditional Italian/I could be in Maggiano's or any other Italian themed restaurant.  That condescending comment doesn't apply to the cool little wine bar/lounge located near the hostess stand.  That part of the restaurant is genius.  But more on that later.  We sat down to enjoy a nice dinner before seeing a friend perform in the aforementioned lounge.  Our server was a bit new and inattentive.  He seemed a bit overwhelmed so we were patient with him.  We ordered a bottle of wine and were nearly halfway through before any sort of food came to the table.  Including the free bread.  I ordered a vegetable pasta dish and my boyfriend got a clam and linguine pasta.  We both agreed that our meals were good, hearty Italian dishes, but nothing out of the ordinary.  It was also a little bothersome that the entrees didn't come with any sort of side (except free bread).  For the location and price point, it might have been nice to have a side salad or a cup of soup come along with the meal, but...it is what it is.     Back to the lounge.  On weekends, there is entertainment in the lounge area, and even though you can only order wine or a cheese plate in there, if you're so inclined, you can walk across the main hallway to the bar area to get yourself a cocktail.  Inside the lounge there are multiple little rooms full of wine bottles, comfy couches, and amazing ambiance.  I kind of wish I'd just been able to take some bread and a bottle of wine in there and skipped my whole dinner.  At one point, people were dancing and there was a very lively crowd.  But if you want to talk with your friends, like I did, it was easy to sneak back further into the connected rooms to be able to talk and hear the live music.    So overall, Frank and Pauly's is a solid Italian restaurant with classic, stick to your ribs, comfort fare.  Worth checking out if you're in the area (and especially if you want to avoid the Mentor chains) and especially worth checking out if you're looking for a place to relax and hang out with a bottle of wine."}
{"text":"What a horrible place, I was very disappointed in this restaurant. From the moment you walk in you are excited because it's really a nice looking place. It feels like it's going to be a good Italian restaurant but looks can be deceiving. The food was some of the worst in the city. I don't believe anything was fresh, it was all canned and processed. I had some kind of chicken and artichoke pasta and my girlfriend had a garlic chicken pasta. The chicken in both pastas looked like dog food, they were perfectly squared and all the veggies were from a can. To top it off they were a little pricey considering all they did was open a few cans and warm it in the microwave. The service was okay, nothing great. We were the only table in the place so it's not like they had a lot going on. I would not suggest this to anyone, in fact I wouldn't even send someone I dislike there. I don't get sick after eating here but we didn't eat that much of the food before we had it boxed up but I can't honestly say my girlfriend and I felt a little strange after eating there. We didn't take any chances and instead of giving the leftovers to the dogs like we normally do we decided to throw them away. Stay safe and don't eat here until they fix this place. I'd love to hear if anyone had a good experience here, I've only been there once and I like to support local businesses but I can't bring myself to give them another chance."}
{"text":"I'd give this place zero stars if I could.  We've been here twice, once for dinner and once for drinks on the patio.  Our dinner was not good at all.  The calamari was overcooked and chewy with a bland, lukewarm sauce; the bruschetta was served on focaccia that was so thick it completely overpowered the topping, which would have been tasty on a piece of Italian bread.  My husband's dinner was bland and uninspired.  I had a salmon special; the salmon was good (the only thing fit to eat in both meals) but the potatoes and vegetables were overcooked and inedible.  Our waitress was apathetic and surly.  Our second visit was a disaster, also.  We had glimpsed the patio on our first visit and thought it would be a nice place to sit outside after dinner (elsewhere, we're not stupid!)  and listen to some live music.  There were very few customers on the patio, so we were able to snag some comfortable, padded furniture.  Big mistake there, because that seating group was next to an open gate, which brought us occasional whiffs of eau de dumpster.  The bar wasn't open, so the server had to go inside and make our drinks herself.  Smoking is allowed on the patio, but we asked the server for an ashtray three times and never got one.  The music wasn't very good, either, but I'm not blaming the restaurant for that.  All in all, it would be great to have a nice restaurant in that beautiful historic building, but we're still waiting for one."}
{"text":"Great food!  The location is good and the ambiance is not what u would expect from a mentor avenue establishment.  The owner was top notch and very friendly - glad to see business's that care about heir customers.    Not a good place to take kids though, leave this place for night out with your significant other!  Highly recommend"}
{"text":"This place is currently at the top of my list of the worst service and slowest kitchens I have every ate at . Two hours and one giant argument later with my wife and we were taking are food to go. This is the reason why you don't have two hour meals with you spouse , come on guys get it together and fix this place . I have three business and couldn't even think to run them this bad and stay in business."}
