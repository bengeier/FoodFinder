{"text":"The worst food ever. Depended on yelp reviews to go check this place out. It was completely disappointing. Everything seemed to be put together by a disinterested chef. The lady at the counter was most unwelcoming, acting as if she is doing  us a favour by letting us come in. Never again for me!"}
{"text":"yummy. I went there several times. They provided very good food, especially the \"Thai rice\"."}
{"text":"Second time ordering take out from here. Great service, FAST and delicious food. Love the green curry!"}
{"text":"Good quality food, on time delivery...ordered many times everything was always really good and fresh."}
{"text":"Love this place! My favourite Thai spot in Mississauga. Food is fresh. Taste is great. I also love that they can accommodate my gluten free diet without compromising flavour. We've had the mango fresh rolls which are the best I've ever had. Also love the Basil Pad Thai and Red Curry. Highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"We stumble upon a gem. We had a take out from this location and was VERY pleased by the service,the food,etc.definately recommand this place."}
{"text":"I love this place! Probably one of the best thai food restaurant opened in Mississauga. Love the Thai rice and Red Curry! Food is reasonably priced as well. You get big portions for every dish you order. Love it!"}
{"text":"My fav Thai take out yum always fresh and always delivered on time. You can really taste all the spices the herbs the ginger coconut. Not greasy... totally recommend this place."}
{"text":"The service here is great, the prices are low for the portion and quality AND super fast! I ordered a pad Thai and spring rolls - they spring rolls were nothing special but the pad Thai had a great flavour. It wasn't an authentic Thai experience (they served lemon with their pad Thai) but it was interesting enough for me to enjoy the unique flavours."}
{"text":"The best Thai food i have ever had. Such great flavour and just the right amount of spice. Had the Chi and Shrimp Satay Pad Thai and Chicken Red Curry. Both were delicious! Its a nice n small takeout place. Great food for a good price."}
{"text":"I was skeptical when I read the positive Google reviews on this place but I'm glad I gave it a try. I'd echo similar comments others have made that it's good value - prices are reasonable and portion sizes are generous. The spring rolls were large. The chicken and shrimp pad Thai had nice, jumbo shrimps (4 of them) and had a nice wok-fried taste. The mango salad was my favourite- many places tend to cheap out and mix in a lot of red onions or other fillers but the mango salad here was probably 90% mangoes.  There's only two small table for two so it's more of a take-out restaurant. Food is made quickly. We called in our order and the lady said it'd be ready in 10-15 mins.  Overall, it's a good place for Thai take out."}
{"text":"Take out gem in the area!  I called in to order for lunch and the woman was very polite on the phone and explained the spice level of some of the items. The order was ready in 10 mins!  The lunch special was $10+tax and the portion was very generous. I got the hot and sour soup and red Thai curry chicken with side of rice.  Soup was a good portion and had a lot of flavour. It's got a kick to it, and I loved it! Not thick like some other hot and sour soups I've had.   Red Thai curry was very good. So smooth with a lot of flavour; and there were tofu pieces along with chicken. And they gave me a lot of rice on the side. More than typical Thai restaurants...   This was more than lunch. I ate the rest for dinner. I'll definitely be going back for more."}
{"text":"Updated review: By now, I have tried 80% of their menu. Everything I have tried is delicious and good value for the price. I am a weekly regular now. So glad I finally tried out this place!"}
{"text":"First time here. Food was decent. Not worth the customer service IMO. Small take out, 3 tables, 1 bar stool. The promo is Buy $25 and save 10% with cash, so we were trying to make our order amount to $25. We were $2.50 off, so it was ok. We asked for rice on the side with curry chicken (how are you suppose to eat curry chicken without any rice), the rice is an extra $2 (which we were fine with). Our food came and the girl forgot to add the rice .. she was arguing with us .. then when we said alright we will buy the rice and a drink, just give us a free drink as it would have somewhat balanced out, her response was \"it has to be on one bill\" ... really ? We just purchased our food and you are so cheap that you wouldn't give a $1 drink to a first time customer - which you messed up on the order ? Great. That saved your business a grand total of $2.50 and costed you a potential returning customer. Definitely not coming back to this place."}
{"text":"I was craving Thai food on a Saturday evening but was wanting to try some place new.  I decided to make the 25 minute drive to try Thai Rice.  It was also beautiful outside and I didn't feel right wasting the day inside.   As others have mentioned this is a primarily take-out place.  Totally not what I expected when I walked in.  Very small with 3 tables to sit at and one high chair at a high table.  So don't be asking all your friends to come to Thai Rice to have a meal.  There's literally 6 chairs.  I was really just craving pad thai, so that's what I got.  Texture is kind of similar to Thai Express.  Meh.  They are very generous with their portions.  It wasn't anything amazing.  They are also generous with the chicken but not the tofu.  There were about 5 pieces.  I was hoping for more. Very saucy.  Noodles were kind of chewy.  Fortunately, the leftover did warm up okay.  Sometimes pad thai can get gross and hard after being in the fridge, but theirs tasted okay after going through the microwave.  THANK GOD, because it is now Monday and more than half the container is still full."}
{"text":"Got takeout... a satay pad Thai and green curry. Curry was way too sweet, but pad Thai was not bad. Given the ratings I was expecting a bit better."}
{"text":"Sweet and friendly service! Accommodating and knowledgeable about different food needs.   Ordered the veggie pad thai with fresh rolls. She automatically confirmed she won't add fish sauce or egg because she over heard my convo with the sister.  Food was good for a take out thai place. Definitely chinese owned but unsure of the cook. Fresh mango roll and spring roll were both delicious and freshly made. No wilting or oily veggie here.   Pad thai was slightly set for me but chili sauce made up for it. Might have been because they needed to make up for the fish sauce flavor. Plentiful veggies and noodles.  2 of us couldn't finish and I took home some!"}
{"text":"A very nice family-style restaurant for (mainly) take-out Thai food."}
{"text":"I found this place through yelp and given the high ratings here I decided to give it a try, and my family and I were not disappointed.  I paid in total $54 for an order of Green Curry (Shrimp), Red Curry (Beef), Satay Pad Thai, Chicken Crisy Wonton, and Fried Chicken.  This served a group of 6.    The curry portions were large and they gave us ample shrimp for our Green Curry.  The fried chicken was flavourful and not dry.  The pad thai was one of the best I have tried.  I really liked the noodle texture.    Where it failed a bit was the crispy wonton. The take out menu said it was chicken wonton but I didn't see much chicken inside.  But I still give full marks for this place.   If you want to save a bit of money then do pick up and pay in cash, they take 10% off the order."}
{"text":"It has been a while since i tried this place, should return soon. Definitely recommend. Their chicken wings are amazing! 1 of the best I have had for sure."}
{"text":"Very convinient and friendly take out place. Nice people. Very clean place and awesome food. They deliver free within 7 km.  You cant ask for anything more if you are living in a neighbourhood.  They do have a lots of vegetarian options too.."}
{"text":"Amazing! best thai food in mississauga. Affordable with large portions too."}
{"text":"Quick, and friendly service. Good for a swift Thai fix if you're craving although not authentic. Slightly bland compared to other Thai in the city."}
{"text":"Note:  Primarily takeout, but there are 3 small tables.  Not ideal for groups!  If you're in the area, this Thai place located in a plaza in a residential area on Britannia (just E of Creditview) is definitely worth a try!  Again, primarily takeout, no frills, casual place.  As per the other reviews, prices are very reasonable, portions are quite generous.  Average prices seemed to be ~$11/beef or chicken dish, before taxes.  There wasn't table service, so I didn't feel a need a tip.  To give you an idea, the food was also served in the takeout containers with styro plates.  This was ok by me because chances are good that you won't be able to finish 1 portion anyway!  Flavours in both the red & green curries were good.  Green curry was slightly spicier and sweeter than red.  My friend said she found the green curry too sweet, but she's used to South-East Asian curries.  Lady behind the counter was very friendly.  She even tried to call me back when I initially called to make sure it was open.  Overall, good value for what is served.  I'd definitely check it out again to try other items on the menu!"}
{"text":"First time getting a takeout here. Great food. Great flavour.  Good portion. I will regularly order takeout from here. Tried the pad Thai and basil fried rice. Both taste great."}
{"text":"3.5 stars ... definitely above average than normal take out and fast food options.  Not super authentic but a very good and affordable option.  This little take out store is in a small strip mall and really unassuming.  I have to say for take out options, it's a solid spot.  The little space itself does have a few tiny tables but This place is clearly focused on take out.  It's clean and minimalist but it does the job to convey it's a small biz that is run well.    It's easy to call in ahead of time and the person is nice when taking the order.  You have your usual option of Thai stir fries, noodles, rice, and curries.  The prices are very fair and when we got them, I would say it's very generous.  The food is made very fast.  My order was done in 15 minutes.  Quicker than I could drive there!  Chicken Satay skewers - 4 fairly large skewers of grilled chicken with an interesting marinade.  It was a touch sweet but it had a coconut note too.  The additional sauce helped bring it together. For the price,  it was a good app.  3.5/5  Shrimp Peanut Stir Fry - generous portions with a decent amount of sauce and good kick of spice, this one had a lot of shrimp.  Good amount of zucchini and carrot to round it out. 3.5/5  Vegetarian Basil Stir Fry - much happier with Thai Rice compared to my Stir fried from Mango Rain.  This one had a great amount of broccoli that was cooked till tender and coated in a basil sauce.  They also had a lot of tofu to fill out the dish.  They're cautious on the spice so my 1 level was pretty tame and I could have asked for more.  It's one of the better Thai fast food I've had.  4/5  This is not a super authentic Thai place but I like it for the fact it gives you well cooked, solid tastes, and very affordable Thai influenced dishes for the stir fries.  I'd be willing to try out the curries to see how they're still good!"}
{"text":"Yum yum!!!! The lunch special is such a large portion. I got chicken pas thai and it was loaded with chicken and tofu. Took 5 minutes to receive my take out after ordering. Very friendly staff!!"}
{"text":"Simple takeout place in Mississauga and always served great Thai food... must have taken out more than ten times but never disappointed... I love their Basil  and been know to owner as Basil Man...."}
{"text":"Wow.. me and my best friend got take out from this restauarant (She dislikes Thai Food, she wanted / preffered Chinese food instead..) and I Love it.. we both ended up Loving it! What we got:  Shrimp Fried Rice - Soooo goood.. I didn't think simple shrimp fried rice would taste this good.. way better then the Pad Thai and I Love Pad Thai.. I definitely know what to order now, if I ever come to this restauarant again and I most likely will!  Basil Fish - My FAVORITE.. My goodness, I will be a regular at this place for this alone and I Never order fish with Thai food but was craving for something different and good thing I did because I fell for these flavors. Mouth Heaven.  Chicken Pad Thai (Glass Noodles, *Extra Saucy lol*) - I enjoyed it.. although, I had better pad thai, it still is a east 3.5 / 4 out of 5  Chicken Crispy Spring Rolls - They were Huge! I wasn't expecting it to be that big to be honest, when I seen the size it was worth the $5 dollars for it.. not only that but they were very flavorful, I will definitly come here for these again for sure  Mango Cold Veggie Rolls - Delicious.. I wish the sauce was more sweet and tangy but we got a salty tamarand sauce thingy to go with it instead. I enjoyed it more then my friend  We payed over $100 for food.. this place is a bit pricey so next time I will only order 2-3 items.. besides that the customer service was decent. My friend asked for extra soy sauce in the bag and the lady forgot it.. If somebody is paying over $100 in my rwstauarant, I wouldn't have time to forget any items.. that's the only reason why they lost a star.. the flavors of the food, they definitely deserve 5 stars but because of the missed soy sauce (we took our time to calk back and let the lady know, thoroughly Exactly what we wanted) it shouldn't have happened but Spilt Milk to me I guess.. my friend complained but after a few bites, calmed down.. she genuinely enjoyed the food too and probably became a new Thai food fan because of me. I recommend this place. They are very good and the food is fresh."}
