{"text":"The service was good and the lady who works there is nice but the food was not good. And it was pretty pricy. I bought food for my brother and I and we couldn't even finish it because it tasted weird. The tacos were also very small."}
{"text":"Awesome food! Been looking for a great authentic Mexican food and this is it, tucked away in the back of an ampm gas station but well worth going to"}
{"text":"The carne asada tacos are very tasty and recommendable. The salsa they have is mouth watering, it's that type of spicy that will get your nose running but you'll be wanting more. I tried the rice and beans once, and they were not as good.   Also their waters are fresh and made in store their horchata is delicious !!"}
{"text":"Good food, good service. Always very friendly and the tacos are great. Little hole in the wall but trust me take a chance and you will not be let down."}
{"text":"I've had awesome street tacos in Puerto Vallarta, Acapulco, Santa Barbara & LA.... amongst other places...these are the Real Deal!! Only wish I'd found it much earlier!  Had al Pastor  & carne asada- grilled onions & peppers- very filling with lots of meat in each."}
{"text":"Inside the Arco station is where you'll find this place. The asada was very overcooked and the tortillas were just ok. Good lunch spot but not for a date night with the wife."}
{"text":"That was the worst food I've ever eaten, I ordered six tacos and one CarneAsada quesadilla it was so greasy I couldn't even eat more than one bite the meat in the tacos seemed old and tasted terrible, it's only been 20 minutes since I've eaten two of the troubles and I already feel sick"}
{"text":"Always great service & food when we come in. I can't name a better authentic taco spot in North Las Vegas!"}
{"text":"Great tacos! Carne asada and pork are my favorites here.  tortas look good but I have only had tacos here.  Very reasonable prices too."}
{"text":"Great tasting tacos and on the weekends they have Menudo that I would say is one of the best I have eaten. Great food here and my kids and I love this place. Check them out!"}
{"text":"The best hidden taco spot in NLV!  My go-to for Saturday/Sunday hangover menudo!  Awesome service/food!"}
{"text":"Quite clean, nice and friendly establishment!  Their salsas are quite spice and tasty, plus they have combos that come paired with beans, rice and a drink for $8 bucks! I went for the 3 tacos platter! Can't go wrong with tacos tho!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite Mexican restaurant in my neighborhood. The food is always consistent and the service is warm and friendly. My favorites are the lengua tacos and horchata."}
{"text":"The food is like homemade.it is family owned and there is not much on the menu so the quality of the food is so much better. It's a hole in the place but if you are looking for Mexican food this is the place. I have tried their taquitos, burritos, tacos, menudo, tortas, and breakfast menu items everything has been great."}
{"text":"Got some steak and marinated pork tacos. Came on a Saturday, tent is set up on the side of the gas station. Definitely get the bang for your buck. Tacos are $1.50 each and are well worth it."}
{"text":"I ordered the chorizo and eggs not knowing what to expect. It turned out to be the best chorizo and egg dish I've ever had this side of the border! This place is a hidden gem inside an Arco station of all places. Don't be turned off by the gas station. I can't recommend a better place in the U.S. to get chorizo and eggs."}
{"text":"The carnitas tacos were somewhat flavorful  the salsa is fresh but bland (watered down) Amy had the hard shell tacos and said they were soggy. Service was poor (not much English spoken and the person who took my order was on a personal phone call the whole time I was there). Don't think I will be returning."}
{"text":"This was first and last visit here! First lady was taking my order and I was currently speaking when a man just walked up spoke Spanish and she completely stopped taking my order, listened to him, gave him his item, took his money,, gave change and then went back to me! That pissed me off. What he gets to cut the line just because he's Mexican? Then the MEAT burrito I ordered as 99% rice and beans.  I counted 15 tiny scraps of meat in my carne Asda burrito.   I'll stick with Roberto's burritos. At least when you order a meat burrito you actually get meat!"}
{"text":"Burrito are awsome the best tacos meat is good not the tortilla they need to change it besides that good food"}
{"text":"awesome. family run place. great taste and very cost effective. inside Arco ampm. dont miss it"}
{"text":"No kidding, the most authentic Mexican Food in town. I had the 3 tacos with nachos. I ate the food so fast, I forgot to take the picture. Nonetheless,  each item was prepared to perfection. The chips on the nachos were light and crisp so that made all the other filling on top even more tasty. There are several different meats you can choose from with the tacos. I got the fish, carne asada and chicken filling I think. Like I mentioned before, I ate my food so fast because it was delicious.  Will return again. The restaurant is inside the AM/PM.  There is also a taco stand outside store. A real treat for Las Vegas."}
{"text":"We live this place and it's walking distance from us. We love that they are a family owned business."}
{"text":"I don't know what the hell people are taking about. Maybe low expectations but this was not great.  $8 for the tinyist tacos and I was not impressed. I'm all about mom and pop shops but this was a disappointment. Like you really wanted it to taste good u keep taking bites and your realize. No."}
{"text":"Great service and kind owners. This is a family owned branch. It looks like a little like a hole in the wall tucked in the back of the AM PM gas station. But don't be discouraged. Try one of their authentic tacos, tortas or the delicious carne asada fries. On weekends they make fresh menudo. Give it a try and you won't be disappointed if you are looking for authentic and hearty portions of food."}
{"text":"I moved from the east side to this side of town and one thing I do miss is having taco stands in every corner... I'm so glad we found this place. It's way better than most places I've been to. The meat is well cooked and the spice is on point."}
{"text":"Great prices, authentic Mexican food, and if you are from the east side like I am. You know the best spots are always at a gas station. Horchata was good. Tacos Al pastor 1.50 each.. Tha bomb!! Not skimpy on the meat. A side bar with lime, jalapeno and zanorias, radishes, and salsa rojo. My son got birria. That was delish. Rice is very tasty. Beans have a slight chicharrón flavor, very good. Hubby got a burrito with carne asada. He loved it. Food was served hot y ta muy rico!!   Our new spot!!"}
{"text":"I was blown away. Don't judge a book by its cover! The Tacos, the ceviche and the birria were tasty, affordable and served with care.   It's truly a humble environment. Don't expect formal dining. Be realistic, it's INSIDE A GAS STATION. Given the simplicity and the great service, as well as the cleanliness, I'm giving them 5 stars."}
{"text":"I love this place. But, I hate that I keep getting burritos even when I am not hungry. I am addicted. I have seen this AM PM location go thru two other Mexican restaurants. I am so glad that this family finally came around. The shrimp cocktail is AMAZING. I get the chicken breakfast burrito most of the time. I just call and Conception has it ready for me when I show up. Prices are very reasonable."}
{"text":"After driving by countless of times on a daily basis...finally decided to stop in on a Friday night.  Their business is literally located inside the gas station towards the back. Not too large, too small...I've been in food places a lot smaller. The family is seriously very nice and they give me a homely vibe, especially the mom.  On tuesday/friday/saturday/sunday they pop a tent outside of the gas station so you don't have to go into the store and you can kinda get that street eating feeling. The husband or even their kids I believe will work the tent. The mom said sometimes the dad will add an extra day during the week or may not even come out depending on his mood. Lol.   We've only had their tacos (street). Street tacos are smaller as they're meant to be one-hand friendly for eating on the streets. I've had the Carne asada and the pollo. Their flavoring is pretty light, in my opinion. But at $1.50 for a taco? Uhhh, tastes good enough to me! Husband has had the tripas and lengua. Not for me, but he too agreed he appreciated the light seasoning.   When I went into their actual restaurant I was able to stare at the big menu at the wall. They pretty much offer your standard Mexican menu at a fair price. Kinda thought they are priced along the lower end. It was very clean. If you happen to go in and it seems cluttered in there, it's because those are the equipment they use when they pop their tent outside of the gas station.   They had a salsa bar with the limes, carrot and jalapeño mix, and sliced radish. Be aware as they only had the red salsa out. I know they have the green one so if you don't see it, just ask.  This will definitely be our new taco spot since it's literally a 2minute drive. I am a hefer for street tacos. cheap and right around the corner, I'm in! However, nothing to drive across town for. 4 stars for value and for the very friendly homely customer service we have received.   Certainly worth a try if you live nearby or! I'd skip bringing the stroller in, but if you must it'll fit in there. Us parents can make it work."}
{"text":"I went here because of the yelp reviews I figured it would be good. I was WRONG the meat on my tacos was old and not tasty at all, the lady and man who were there were very much nice and helpful but the food being offered out was not fresh nor good whatsoever. Now I will not return"}
{"text":"Wasn't sure about this place, but my boyfriend  insisted after trying them for himself one day. I love their tacos and wish I would've tried it sooner! My favorite are their al pastor tacos. I seriously crave them all the time. Delicious and is a must try!!!"}
{"text":"I was craving for Mexican Cuisine after a run and happened to see that Tacos El Tapatio was close by.  I thought this would be the perfect meal since not only was I craving tacos, but that the place wasn't a conventional Taco Bell or Del Taco.  Long story short, I ordered 2 carne asada tacos and one al pastor.  There was hardly any meat on any of the tacos and the presentation was absolutely sloppy:  it's as if a child put two pieces of meat on each taco and smothered it in lettuce.  I had a bite of the taco and then left.  I should've gotten a burrito as that looked normal but I recommend to stay away from the tacos."}
