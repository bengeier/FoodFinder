{"text":"This is a great little find I found driving home from work! Clean vibrant and AWSOME customer service! The Poke Bowl with double protein is Bomb..... give it a try!"}
{"text":"We had a great, fresh poke bowl with LOTS of toppings & fish. It was fresh & delicious. We also got the Korean fried chicken fries which were super tasty. The owners were extremely friendly & even gave us some free mochi ice cream for dessert. I was talking to the owner about hot sauces & he went to the back to bring me a special hot sauce to try. They went out of their way to make sure our dining experience was great. Support these nice people not only because they're nice, but their food is yummy!!!"}
{"text":"This place didn't look too appealing but there bowls are really great and has so much flavor! I definitely recommend coming here"}
{"text":"What a fantastic experience!  food is Super Fresh, good combination of flavors. husband and wife team that manage the restaurant are super friendly and nice people. This is not a chain restaurant and does not have chain food you will get a very personalized good experience here.  Good value."}
{"text":"A surprising little spot by UNLV. You wouldn't think that a poke place would have good ramen, but it was pretty good for $6. Can't wait to try the poke. I will be back."}
{"text":"Poke and Ramen we're both outstanding! Fish is fresh, crisp veggies, lovely sauces that are authentic Hawaiian style poke. Owners Mom was from Hawaii and he developed the house sauce from watching her growing up. Many places pre-marinate fish. Not a fan. It's a way to coverup lack of freshness. This was not overly saucy (and I love sauce), but full of flavor with perfect options. Love the toppings like fried garlic, jalapeños, avocado, pickled cucumbers, and tons more I cannot list with dying iPad. I. Glad I made the drive from Henderson. Great off strip whole in the wall with friendly family owners. I drove past several poke places to come here. I'm glad I did. Also tried some of my son's ramen. Delightful and cleared his allergy attack. Thank you!"}
{"text":"I have been very fortunate with finding good poke from Yelp. Poke Heaven is a perfect example of everything you want when you want poke. The facility is clean, brightly lit, and cutely decorated. The staff were really great, helpful, patient, answered all my questions and made excellent recommendations. The food was delicious and fresh and full of flavor. I had the regular size poke bowl, it came with 2 proteins and it was plenty for dinner. If I lived local this would be a weekly visit. These fine folks are destined for big things, go eat at Poke Heaven!"}
{"text":"In a small strip mall by UNLV. Family run and great value.  Fresh and flavorful poke bowl that's made to order. Ramen was decent for a poke bar.  Next time going to try the Korean chicken. That looked ono. Friendly vibe. Will be back!"}
{"text":"I would first like to disclose that this is my first official yelp review. As a current/long time food server in fine dining I haven't always cared for the advent of customer reviews via social platforms however, a place like Poke Heaven is much deserved for a terrific review. 

Staff/service: Family like and very accommodating with very fast service. 

Dining setting: Clean, simple... most restaurants are covered with \"bells and whistles\"... too much visual stimulation to distract you from your cuisine, that is not necessary here.

Menu/Cuisine: Simplified approach for a menu/ordering presentation that is not intimidating. The flavors, while they are very authentic and approachable they are still complex and modern at the same time.

I WILL REVISIT... ONCE A WEEK!"}
{"text":"My family and I have been looking for a good poke spot that made us feel like we were back home in Hawaii. Great food and great service. Love it!"}
{"text":"Still my number 1 poke stop! Been a regular here constantly and have really got to know them and talked. One thing they want to do is add Honey Toast to their dessert menu. It's currently not on the menu as they are testing it out, but if you're a constant regular and they've known you ask for that VIP dessert"}
{"text":"Super convenient near airport and UNLV.  We stopped in for an early dinner on our way to the airport and had two regular sized tasty and healthy poke bowls.  Good options and reasonably priced. Friendly and helpful staff and so, so clean.  We'll be back soon!"}
{"text":"Every time I crave for Poke, I always make my way to Poke Heaven. Why? It's cause of their delish food. Mouthwatering sauces makes this joint a great place to experience poke at a different level. I definitely recommend this place..."}
{"text":"If you've ever gone to Aloha Kitchen in vegas, you'll know the little strip that it's located. Adjacent to Aloha kitchen is Poke Heaven, which is new to me. Being that the last I was in vegas was exactly a year ago, I don't remember this being here. Know me to remember if there's was a poke place there. I think everytime we go to vegas, we get poke somewhere. 

*Poke Burrrito- This place is a fresh spot. The protein option can get more if you were to ask me. Poke spots now have cooked shrimp, crawfish, and scallop. I think this place only had 5 or 6 options. That's ok. It really is on the flavor and freshness of the fish, which this place had. Every bite had fish and flavor, and the flavor here is good. Don't sleep on this place, I think this place might get bigger and start evolving. I hope they look over the competition and see what others are doing on instagram to spice the menu up, because they have a good base down, they just need the traffic. 

The sauce are available from a low medium high type of spicy. This is early pokinometry like style of place. If this place came before pokinometry, this place would be leading in the trend race. 

Overall, I am impressed. I love the local shop trying to get poke out there to the masses. I would recommend them putting more variety, but they have something good going for them. I hope they are there the next time I pass by. Thank you for the meal."}
{"text":"The staff here are super friendly and the prices are really fair, especially for the amount of food that you get. I got a regular poke bowl with brown rice and two scoops of salmon with a bunch of other sides. The food tasted great and I like the variety of sides that they have available."}
{"text":"Poke has come for the UNLV crew! This place has a slightly more traditional vibe: they hand mix your fish with sauce, have less frou-frou toppings to add on, and offer specials like garlic shrimp for those who aren't fond of raw fish. Pricing is comparable to other similar spots, with a slightly larger portion size than is typical.

My large bowl (3 proteins, $12) was a large and filling lunch. The fish was fresh, and their house spicy sauce was tasty but not spicy. I like that they include crab in the bowls without counting it as a protein. As a major plus, they have fried garlic, which is one of my favorite toppings. I can't say I'll necessarily be a regular, but it's better than the options across the street!"}
{"text":"Super nice customer service. Better prices then in California. We'll come again when we come back to Vegas."}
{"text":"I came here for the first time today and OMG the poke bowl was amazing! 10/10. The person that took my order was so cute and bubbly and she was generous with my servings. I just read that it's family owned which I'm also happy about. I went to another poke spot around the area a while back ago but it seemed more overpriced and wasn't as flavorful as it is at this place. This one by far has to be my favorite. The quality and serving size is great for what you pay for. I'm definitely coming back here again."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite poke spots in Vegas . The owner is awesome and very friendly . They also have Korean fried chicken and Korean fried chicken fries which are just crazy good ! The poke is very filling and fresh . Never hungry after one of these poke bowls ."}
{"text":"Super ono! Poke heaven convert. 
Greeted upon entering and felt welcome. Definitely can see the mom/pop feel as the owners very friendly and down to earth hard working ppl. Really delicious bowls. Don't be overwhelmed by the possibilities. Deconstructed ingredients, pick your proteins, toppings and sauces. I'm not going to say I'm a poke expert but I'm a purest. I like really good fish. It wldn't be fair to Poke Heaven to list their competition but they are my new favorite. 

My bowl was spicy ahi, kimchee tako, imitation crab, white rice, cucumber, avocado, wonton strips, furikake sprinkled on top. With unagi sauce drizzle. 

Pros: veg crisp/fresh, fish fresh/ good consistency, flavorful - poke is tossed in a metal bowl made to order your specifications. Kimchee tako was tender and cut nice thin strips. 

Cons: the rice was warm in the poke bowl. Just a preference really for me to have neutral rice so as not to cook/sweat my fish in the container. Luckily I ate this so fast.. no chance of that!"}
{"text":"I love the poke bowl and the garlic shrimp. The food is really delicious! The place is very clean and nice.. and the customer service is excellent. Everything is fantastic. I can recommend it to my friends.."}
{"text":"This was my 3rd Poke spot experience. 
It was a good one . 

This place is located on Maryland Parkway right behind the university. It was very clean and the girls behind the counter were very nice and helpful. 

One thing i would recommend is adding a ponzu sauce option as I know people who are always looking for Poke spots and always mentioning the sauce options. 

My bowl was great. My bowl was great. I also got a bowl of Ramen on special  for under $13. I'd come back to this place.

The only other thing I'd recommend is maybe some music , and if there was music on lets turn up the volume !"}
{"text":"Came here because of a conference at UNLV. Little family owned business with smiles, and great poke! Very well priced and traditionally made. Also had the ramen and really enjoyed the flavor of the broth, however, would love to see the option of adding an egg to it. 

Also, the restaurant was clean and so were the restrooms."}
{"text":"My new favorite poke place for sure! Love that it's family owned and that they keep the traditional Hawaiian flavors with the options of adding all kinds of extra toppings."}
{"text":"The best poke bowl in town, hands down. I come here for lunch at least once a week and it's always fresh and delicious. The ladies that run this place are super sweet and helpful."}
{"text":"They are having an amazing winter special if you buy a regular sized poke bowl, you get a ramen cup as well for just $12.49, amazing deal and so yummy!!"}
{"text":"You can choose the fish you want and flavor it with the sauce you prefer.
Good portions and fair price. Staff very friendly"}
{"text":"THE BEST POKE PLACE EVER!!! I would always go to one near 215 & Eastern but as soon as I went here, it was legit heaven! They normally put a lot of protein so the price is most def worth it."}
{"text":"I got a Poke burrito with three proteins and most of the adding's  and the korean chicken fries.( Both Bomb!! )My first but definitely not last time here. All the ingredients are all so fresh and you have a variety to choose from. The staff were friendly and made us feel at home."}
{"text":"The carne fries Hawaiian style are delish. The poke is fresh and they can customize whatever you want because it's made right in front of you. Great flavor and very filling. Coming back for sure."}
{"text":"Poke Heaven is a small family owned restaurant located inside the plaza beside UNLV and In N Out. You can order a poke bowl here, where 2 scoops of protein is $9 and 3 scoops is $10.50. A sushi burrito comes out $10. You can also order a bowl of ramen. They also have a dish called the korean chicken fries, which I recommend!

They provide a generous amount of protein, sides, and rice within the bowl. I had a mix of white rice and sushi rice. My favourite sauce to put in all poke bowls is the spicy mayo.

Generous portions, good food, and good service!"}
{"text":"their customer service is beyond amazing and their food is sooooo yummy :D we ordered the korean chicken and poke bowl both w/ greens, i was suprised by how many sides you could add to your bowl (the spicy ahi and tako was perfect). we dined in, during which one of the staff members came out from the kitchen to check on our table and noticed my bf had finished all his greens but still had chicken left in the bowl, she then offered to bring more greens no charge :O we're definitely coming back super soon wootwoot :]"}
{"text":"Honestly the best poke place you can find I'm Vegas. The portions are generous, and the quality is great. I've been to many poke places and this is my top 1."}
{"text":"Great poke with the most friendly family running the place. My teen daughter didn't really breathe as she inhaled her meal and loved the quality of the fish. We'll definitely be coming back to visit."}
{"text":"Took a little while to place order but the wait was worth it!!! Their poke bowls are large and they have many fresh items to choose from. I needed quick and filling and once my turn was up I was ready for it!!!! I will absolutely be back for more!"}
{"text":"Bomb super fresh tuna healthy options great food for a hot day in Vegas. Service was great and super helpful on options to order and what to try. I'll definitely come back here."}
{"text":"Their Korean chicken and poke are delicious and super filling!  The staff is also incredibly kind and made sure that we were happy with what we ordered! I'd recommend trying it out!"}
{"text":"Very tasty and fresh food. Plus, they gave us free rice for our toddler - unexpected kind bonus."}
{"text":"Great service! From the time we walked in their hospitality was very welcoming. After a long night out we def woke up with a Poke craving. We came across this place because it was closest to our hotel. And my ooo myyy this place was delicious. Fresh and great portions. Def a go to spot when I'm in Vegas. Def worth the place!!"}
{"text":"AMAZINGGGGG. We were in Vegas for a conference but we were craving poke (we're from Hawaii) and didn't really expect much from a mainland poke place but, like I said, it was AMAZING. I wish we had a poke place like this back home!! You get to make your own bowls with whatever protein you want (ahi, spicy ahi, salmon) at a great price and put basically whatever you want in it (edamame, corn, spicy house sauce, garlic chips, wonton chips, etc). Their ramen is great too."}
{"text":"This is a great lunch option.  The food is fresh and delicious.  Location is clean and casual.  I highly recommend."}
{"text":"Korean chicken fries are so good! Adequately dressed in sauce and there's a great portion. You can probably wolf this down alone or share it for two people if you are feeling nice.

Service is chipotle-style where you pick proteins, sides, sauces, etc. Simple and quick.

They offer a special where you can add ramen for $13 including a bowl with two proteins. Not a bad deal at all."}
{"text":"Great late afternoon stop, with gracious service, fresh ingredients, and generous portions.  Simple and straight forward food - nutritious and fullfilling - and a reasonable price to boot."}
{"text":"Delicious!! Great, friendly service! Would definitely come back. Try the house sauce."}
{"text":"Thanks me itoo tmnttikagain y the zombies geez our crew yank on .edurrftyews
Thanks ibountil uu USA"}
{"text":"This poke place is amazing. Super delicious and extremely friendly, helpful staff. Glad I found this in Vegas because I've missed poke ever since I had to come back home from Hawaii."}
{"text":"Good place! Must try if you're a poké fan and you're in Vegas. The food tasted great and the service was really good. You can customize your bowl any way you like!"}
{"text":"My bf wanted Firehouse Subs (next door) and I went along, but wasn't 100% sold on the idea. Luckily, when we passed by, we saw this new restaurant, Poke Heaven!! Being from Hawaii, I was happy to see a little store pop up offering more choices in the 9th island.

First of all, the restaurant is CLEAN and the people are nice. I love that they have a glass cover that keeps all the food cool and clean when there are no customers around. There are a lot of choices, and I'll upload the pictures after I write the review. 

WHAT I GOT:
I chose two proteins (regular size) and opted for two servings of tuna over a base of sushi rice. I added green onion to my poke and chose the spicy sauce and sesame oil. I added seaweed salad on the side, along with jalapeno, ginger, edamame, fried garlic, fried wontons, furikake, sesame seeds, and masago. 

VERDICT:
As far as poke bowls go, this place is the best I've had in Vegas. Everything was fresh, and the seaweed salad was some of the best period. The portion size is huge and I like that they don't charge extra for edamame (one of my loves since childhood). The fried garlic adds a surprising twist and I will definitely do that again next time. For $9, it's a great deal and the large being only $10.50 (for three proteins) is an even better deal (if you can eat that much!). I am happy to find this place and I will gladly walk the extra distance from Soho in the Student Union. I can't wait to try the garlic shrimp, ramen, and Korean chicken. You can get your meal as a sushi burrito, too. Give it a try; you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"This place is great.  The people there are so nice.  The chef has great sauces.   We almost always split a large bowl which is enough for two average people.  The ramen is excellent but I recommend you go with the mild.   I tried the kimchee taco poke today and it is my new favotite.  Be sure to get a stamp card."}
{"text":"Not great not many sauces to choose from. Tuna didn't taste that great either! Sweet poke down the way is much better. Nice staff but that's about it."}
{"text":"OMG their Korean chicken. So yummy, crispy, sweet and spicy and so delicious! I'll try the poke next time if I resist the urge to get the Korean chicken fries!"}
{"text":"This place was cool. The owners were there and made sure that everything was okay. The food was fresh and the burritos were huge. They have a chicken dish that is really good too but I forgot the name."}
{"text":"If you're looking for Poke you've got to come here!  I'm from Los Angeles where there are Poke places at almost every corner and I've had my share of Poke.  This place is absolutely yummy!  Better than any Poke I've tried yet!  Their price is extremely reasonable and the portions are abundant!   The place is clean and the owners are extremely friendly!  A must while in Vegas!!!"}
{"text":"Taken aback on how good this place is ....great service yummy food. I like how they let you pick your protein and toppings .. I got salmon and kimchee tako- which is a must try!! for my proteins ontop of brown rice and lettuce and added a bunch of yummy toppings such as masago seaweed salad corn etc... Also try their house sauce!  Glad I chose this place ...im all about supporting mom and pop shops !! Mahalo poke heaven !!"}
{"text":"I've been using Yelp for years and this is the first review I'm posting because I couldn't help but talk about how great this restaurant is! The food gives you the perfect taste of Hawai'i! The owners are so welcoming and friendly and I enjoy coming in and talking to them. If you want good poke and amazing customer service, this is the place to go!"}
{"text":"Okay, so I have been to several poke spots around Las Vegas. I do not live near UNLV. I was in the area and found this place on yelp. It is fantastic. The tuna and salmon is so fresh. Everything tastes so good. And the staff is so incredibly friendly! The lady came to my table to ask if I needed anything and was so sweet. Try this place out. You will not be disappointed. The food and service really is \"Heaven\" in my opinion."}
{"text":"Highly recommended mom&pop resto.  Good quality, fair price, friendly staff.  My fav poke place!"}
{"text":"Exceptional service. Super fresh. Delicious food. Even the water tasted great. Incredibly friendly people. Just go already."}
{"text":"I didn't have to fly to Hawaii or anywhere far to get me some bomb garlic shrimp just right off the Las Vegas strip and right outside the Mccaren airport. Also tried the Sushi burrito! So good! Wish I had a place like this this while I was in collage to eat at. The UNLV students are so lucky to have this great place to eat near campus!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing!  I was hesitant because I never heard of poke bowls but I came here with my cousins and it was delicious!  Everything is fresh, we got a little bit of everything. I can't wait to come back"}
{"text":"Delicious!  Both female employees were very friendly and welcoming!  Food was delicious and a large portion.  Plenty of seating available to dine in."}
{"text":"I go here at least once a week The poke bowl is always a must with the Korean chicken fries. The fries ARE TO DIE FOR!!! It is now a guilty pleasure and a treat no matter what. The Staff is beyond friendly I look forward to every visit."}
{"text":"This poke place is probably one of my favorites. Other than good food, the restaurant is clean, and the service is excellent. The people are so nice & helpful, I always feel so welcome here! The price is pretty good too (since I'm a college student at UNLV who struggles with finding decent price food)!

If it's your first time, they're very patient with you deciding on what's good for you! More people need to know about this place!"}
{"text":"Poke Heaven
Very friendly service
Fast simple clean Healthy and 0n0
Thank you Judith
Thank you Uilani
Appreciate the Aloha shown to us when we come in!!! If you haven't already ate here come on what you waiting for!!!"}
{"text":"Best poke in town! This is the go to spot for all unlv students! Affordable and great tasting!"}
{"text":"Poke Heaven is a great little place! The employees are super kind and friendly. The fish and other ingredients are always fresh and delicious. My poke bowl was put together with precision and care. You can really tell the owner and employees are passionate about what they're doing. They treat you like family and the entire atmosphere of the restaurant embodies \"good vibes.\" Calm, and quiet, but the quality of the food speaks LOUDLY!"}
{"text":"Wow great place for local Hawaiian food. We had their poke bowl ($9) and Korean fried chicken (I don't remember the price but it was cheap). Really good flavor on the Korean chicken it was like I was back home in Hawaii. The portions are huge. The ahi wasn't super fresh but it's vegas and we're by unlv so I'm not expecting fresh out of the sea stuff. The sauces were great. Service was great. Try it out."}
{"text":"This is my favorite poke bowl place in town.  This isn't pre-marinated/flavored Hawaiian poke. This is make your own, mix ingredients, sauces, etc.

They have 4 steps.  Choose your base or mix (white rice, sushi rice, brown rice, and/or greens)
Choose your mix ins, (white onion, green onion, cucumber) if you choose the imitation crab salad, it is served as a scoop on the side.
Choose your protein (salmon, tuna, taco, shrimp, tofu)
Choose your sauce (not a lot of choice here but the house sauce is very tasty and comes in mild, regular, and spicy as well as a siracha mayo, and sesame oil) 
Then choose your toppings.  Some cost extra.  Shrimp tempura (cooked to order so not greasy), salmon, seaweed salad, furikake, fried garlic, corn, edamame, etc.

I have only tried the salmon and tuna but both tasted very fresh.  I liked the shrimp tempura as it was light and not greasy.

I've also tried both the miso and tonkatsu ramen.  Both are yummy with good size portions for the price.  It isn't Fukimimi or Ramen Sora but they had good flavor.  

I wanted to love the Korean Fried Chicken Fries and while they tasted good they were VERY heavy. 

They have a Rebel Special that is a regular size bowl (two scoops of protein) and a 1/2 ramen for $12.49  They also have a stamp card for frequent purchases."}
{"text":"Stoped by to get some lunch with the fam. If your ever by UNLV  and craving poke @poke.heaven is the best! Make sure to stop by and also there Korean chicken its !!!!"}
{"text":"My fav poke spot in town !! I come here often and every time it's a great experience . I either get a bowl or burrito depending on how I'm feeling and they are both equally filling ! The fish is always fresh and the ingredients they use are great . One of my favorite things about this place is the selection of yummy sauces they have !!! 

Friendly staff as well , they have great customer customer service here :) 

Also try the ramen , it's bomb ."}
{"text":"This place I give a 4.5/5! Such a cute mom and pop owned poke shop. There was such a cute little kid in the front doing cashier lol but the service here is really great, they are attentive and they work efficiently. It's clean here and the ingredients are fresh. We got a regular poke bowl (2 proteins) and a  large poke bowl (3 proteins). Total came out to be around 22$ which is usual price for poke! 

Tuna and salmon is fresh here, I always recommend that. The kimchi take (sliced octopus) was so flavorful, I recommend this if you like spicy and octopus! Their imitation crab reallyyyyyyy packs on the mayo though which for me is was a lil heavy but it was still yummy. I got half salad and half brown rice and I don't recommend their brown rice. It was kind of hard and really chewy like it wasn't fresh so I recommend their white or sushi rice. They really pack it with the rice so it's pretty filling! 

Their sauces are good, we got the chipotle aioli and house special spicy. I recommend Adding some sesame oil and your bowl will be soooo flavorful. 

Overall this is a great quality poke shop. Fish is fresh and the sides add so much flavor. Avocado and seaweed salad are both a 1$ extra each. They have a special going on for a regular poke bowl and half tonkatsu or miso ramen for 12.95$! Such a steal. Next time I'm going to get the Korean chicken fries! They were only 8$ and they give a really generous amount. This is the place to go if you want some fresh poke and some yummy fries! They also have rice bowls and ramen if you're not into poke! I always love supporting small businesses like these, they environment is always so homey and welcoming. I will be back for sure."}
{"text":"What can I say?? We will be back here at least two more times in the next 5 days that we are in town...The Poke is so Fresh!! Friendly service, Family recipes and everything is oh so tasty...!! Try the spicy house sauce on your Poke, or the Korean Chicken Fries...!  Garlic shrimp was awesome as well... very reasonable prices... Thank you Pamela for making us feel welcome and for holding on to our punch card for next time!"}
