{"text":"Overpriced food and despite advertising beer selection on the hotel key cards only two craft beer options on menu. Free popcorn is a nice touch. 

Hey it's an airport hotel bar what can you expect."}
{"text":"Had breakfast here. Decent food. But nothing to write one about. Breakfast included toast. One side was over toasted and the other looked like un-toasted bread. Not that hard to make toast. Either the staff doesn't care or they don't take the time to do it properly."}
{"text":"Unique and yummy menu options!  I had never heard of a tandoori chicken sandwich before and decided to try it. Wow!!! Tasted amazing!  

Had the lamb kebabs. It had a lot of flavor, although it was an extremely small portion of it. The butter chicken taco's were the most delicious ever. I don't eat all the ingredients it came with from the menu, but when I tasted it, it was absolutely perfect!"}
{"text":"The breakfast is good. We've eaten here at least 10 times when we've come to Canada in the last 5 years. 

But we have been sitting here for 1 1/2 hours.  The dinner service is very slow.  

The apple tart was a B minus. They need a different pastry supplier."}
