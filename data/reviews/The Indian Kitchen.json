{"text":"The best Naan's ever made.  Having eaten at every Indian restaurant in Toronto & at all the top five star restaurants when I last visited Punjab, India (2011), The Indian Kitchen has the absolute best naan's you'll ever have. Period. Thin, soft with a slight crisp, they tear & fold easy. They never get hard & are so easy to chew. Absolute Perfection!"}
{"text":"You really can't go wrong with their lunch buffet for only $10.99. If you're in a rush you can get the buffet to go for the same price! There's enough options for a buffet but don't expect 30+ different selection as if you're walking into a Mandarin. You're looking around 10 main dishes and a salad and fix-ins bar. The naan is freshly made and brought to your table.  The goat was our favourite.  Their dishes weren't that spicy but that's an easy fix. I think there were maybe 2 dessert options? Can't sit in and you're on the run? They will give you a box and you can fill the box up for $10.99. Did I mention YOOOUUU fill the box up yourself? They give you a big box as well. Overall favourite dishes were the goat (did I mention the goat?) and paneer. There's plenty of room so bring a gang of people."}
{"text":"I was reluctant to try this place because I wasn't sure if the place had new owners or whether Nataraj had just renovated and changed its name.  Nataraj was okay, but I would go out of my way to Banjara instead even though Nataraj is only a 3 minute walk from my house.    I was very pleasantly surprised with how great the food is at The Indian Kitchen.  I ordered my standard butter chicken, saag paneer, and plain naan and rice. It hit the spot - very good sized portions and tasted as good as it gets!  I can't speak for the service because I got take out, but they seemed nice enough. And I agree that most Indian buffets are mediocre (trying to please the common denominator), so I wouldn't judge this place by the buffet."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for years.  Like previous posters, getting tired of the decor and the third class washroom, but the price and Indian cuisine kept me coming.   I just visited their new restaurant location...same owner good food, its buffet prices went up...whatever, nothing good lasts forever.....good location....better decor....better washroom....I will come again"}
{"text":"I had dinner here (so not the lunch buffet), and it was delicious :) The dining experience was fairly upscale and the food was great. The wait staff seemed to have a little bit of coordination difficulties (like asking if we wanted to order right after someone had just taken it), but were extremely friendly and helpful in explaining menu items and how to eat them properly. I would recommend trying their homemade pistachio ice cream for dessert. One appetiser, an entree, an order each of naan and rice, plus two desserts came to a total of about 50 dollars."}
{"text":"One of our usual dinner places. Really good naan, fresh rice, hot papadums and a number of vegetarian dishes from which to choose. Love the navratam korma and khumb mutter panner (??spelling). There is some inconsistency with flavour though as some days are better than others. We often take-out, but we've always received good service in the restaurant."}
{"text":"Got take-out from here based on positive reviews and proximity to where I live.  The naan was good, and the food was certainly edible, but the flavors and textures were all off.  The chicken in the tikka masala was moist and tender, but the sauce was terrible.  There was barely any paneer in the mutter paneer and the sauce was flavorless.  I didn't tray the saag, but my husband was all around unimpressed.  We will not be going here again."}
{"text":"This is my favourite place in THornhill  Lots a vegetarian selections and tons on selection in general The aloo gobi and mutter panner is delicious as well as the tandoori fish Never had a bad experience with the food here"}
{"text":"On 4th December I went to the restaurant to order biryani to take out.When I open parcel to serve at home I saw they had mix some rice in gravy and sold as biryani. I don't recommend this restaurant at all as it show that they even don't know difference between gravy and biryani.its just waste of money"}
{"text":"This is an absolutely amazing restaurant. Every time I have been here it has been great! Best Indian food in Toronto by far. I ordered the lamb and it was perfect, I never even liked lamb before this! They suggested it and it was great! The service was also very very good. Everything I have ever ordered here was spectacular, they have a great chef!"}
{"text":"Good food, but hindered by inattentive service and worn down restaurant. I heard they may be moving soon, will possibly try again once they have the new location.  Recommended dishes - mutton (goat) curry - eggplant"}
{"text":"Ok this is still the best Indian food in T.O. and I've eaten Indian all over the city!! I think the Nan is buttery and melts in yoir mouth. I love all their gravies. The Peas Pulao is awesome! My usual is Murgh Tikka Lababdar, Beef Vindaloo, and Butter chicken for my BF.  We come every week. The staff is friendly and always greet us with a smile. Excellent service as well."}
{"text":"This was my favourite Indian restaurant in Toronto. Unfortunately, they have closed down :("}
{"text":"We had $10.99 lunch buffet on Sunday. The salads are frozen cold, but the taste is great. The butter chicken isn't that great, vegetables are fresh. We are not going again. But for the price, u get what you paid."}
{"text":"This place is pretty awesome.  Indian buffet lunch for $10.  Fresh naan, goat curry, tandori chicken, daal comes to mind.  It's a small place but it has great service.  They used to offer paneer in the buffet and I haven't seen it in a while.  It was by far my favorite.  Their yoghurt dressing is amazing.   A must try, definately at lunch as turnover of food is high."}
{"text":"Been going here over the last year. Good food and good service. One of the better indian restaurants in the Annex."}
{"text":"I've gone here over the years and here's my take.   Lunch buffet is a sorry let down with a small selection. So don't have high expectations going in. You'll still find good value because for $9.99 you have a choice of more than a dish. Fortunately the outstanding white meat butter chicken is included in the buffet selection. I can have my butter chicken fix here.   There's some exceptional dishes here though like the butter chicken, murg tikka served on a hot iron plate and the biriyani. Go here for dinner the quality is significantly better.   That's the food.   For the rest of the restaurant, the atmosphere and decor sparse and lacking, service nothing to brag about.  i think this restaurant survives mainly  due to it's proximity to yonge st, located under a condo building (convenient for people who don't cook), they charge a lot per dish at dinner,  one of the only Indian restaurants in Thornhill."}
{"text":"I've been to the buffet twice now at the new location.  I was very impressed.  Better than the Yonge St. location."}
{"text":"This place has gradually gone downhill over the years. Their previous location was shut down by the health board. Just a few days ago, their current location was also shut down by the health board. It's a shame because their food was always the best of the best Indian food in the GTA."}
{"text":"Actually a nice restaurant on the inside. Nice staff, though they are a bit absent-minded. A little bit pricy, especially for the Annex. Example - butter chicken is 12.50, but then the rice is 3.50. Or garlic naan bread is 3.49. I still recommend it if you are in the area and don't mind spending a bit on your meal!"}
{"text":"I only had the weekend buffet at this place and oh boy is it great! fresh backed naan is my favorite, different dishes on different days provides variety. Food tastes 'home made'. Service is very good, courteous and friendly. I've been to this spot at least a dozen times and never once left unhappy. I would highly recommend the weekend buffet. $9.50 for this quality is too little to pay but I'm not complaining. ; ) awesome spot for lunch with friends or family. come early and receive the best service and food then you would later on during the day when the place fills up. (service stays good, but since the place is a bit more packed, you should understand that you will have to be a little more patient)"}
{"text":"This is my favourite Indian restaurant in the GTA! Their food is consistently good but I've only gone for dinner - I've heard the lunch buffet isn't anything to write home about but I haven't tried it myself.  Some of my favourite dishes are the Murg Tikka Lababdar, Chicken Korma, Butter Chicken, Aloo Ghobi and the naan is also fantastic.  Unfortunately they don't deliver or I'd probably have it a lot more often!  BTW, they have a window in front of the tandoor and allow the diners to watch naan being made if you are so inclined."}
{"text":"$10.99 lunch buffet unbeatable!  Butter chicken not recommended here.  Variety limited.  No dessert either.  Nan bread was pretty good but by order only."}
{"text":"A $10.99 Indian buffet in Thornhill everyday including weekends? Butter chicken and fresh naans for brunch on a Sunday??? So down!   So happy we found this amazing place!  This is definitely not the last time here! Mmm butter chicken heaven!"}
{"text":"The service is awful. We found a hair in the biryani we order. We showed the wait staff... nothing was said, no apologies... just an \"oh\" and they took it away. Came back with another bowl of rice... which is from the same pot of rice the hair was in initially. It was disgusting. We ate the rest of the food.  We received the bill and was charged for the rice... my parents are very calm people and they don't say anything, even when they are being taken advantage of... and if they weren't there I would have said something.   There are lot of Indian restaurants in the area with better staff and customer service. Just because somewhere is overpriced doesn't mean the food will be better... its all the same ingredients that they get some costco and the indian grocery store down the block."}
{"text":"I called to find out what was on the buffet. The owner refused to tell me, said we should just show up and find out, and hung up on me. Twice. Extremely rude, and I'm so disappointed because I've enjoyed eating here."}
{"text":"My visit to this place was a mixed experience for me.  The place is pretty nice inside and the service was quite friendly.  But the food was a little lacking.  Our pakora was fine but we had to keep asking for more and more chutney since they gave us so little first time around.  The tandoori chicken was very juicy and moist (I'll give them that) but rather on the bland side.  The prawn masala was serviceable but I would've paid less than half of what they charged.  The vegetable jalfrezi was rather strange in that it had cubes of paneer and bits of corn in it (I've never seen either one before in a jalfrezi - I guess everyone has their own recipe but I didn't care for these additions).  And for what's supposed to be jalfrezi (which is usually hot and spicy), it wasn't hot and spicy at all.  Considering that there are better options throughout the city for Indian food, I don't think I'll be returning here."}
{"text":"- was in the annex, and had the sudden hankering for some indian food. - their buffet lunch for the two of us was about $25 - all your standards dishes are there (i.e. butter chicken, mattar paneer, etc) - pretty bland stuff. really safe on the spice, which i assume they did to cater to the neighborhood. - in addition to the suspect stomach ache i had afterwards tells me i will not be back. - oh the waiter, was really annoying. he was trying to be nice, but couldnt catch our subtle turned overt hints that we weren't interested in chatting with him. - sorry indian kitchen"}
{"text":"Tried the lunch buffet today. It's $11 a person.   Pros Relaxing ambiance  Good price  Fast service   Cons VERY limited food options  Mediocre tasting food  Would not return"}
{"text":"I need to admit something.... Something that I have been ashamed of for quite some time... Wait for it... I've only ever eaten Indian food once before in my entire existence on this earth. There, I  said it. It's off my chest.. That being said, for my second time, I ventured to The Indian Kitchen on Bloor street on Saturday night with a group of friends. This just confirmed the fact that I am so ridiculous for not having more of it sooner. The dishes (not that I can remember their names.. Although the Butter chicken I do remember and it was AMAZING) were delicious. So flavourful and hearty. The Service, unlike a previous review, was quite genuine. The servers were friendly, helpful and really made the effort to make sure we would return.  The best part.... The bill was remarkably low... And I was stuffed!   If you're like me where it's hard to get out of your shell and try something new, like Indian, I would suggest starting at this joint."}
{"text":"Decent northern Indian food with friendly, genuine services.  The fish was surprisingly tasty.  We went for dinner and not for the buffet (something I wouldn't mind trying on my next trip to Canada).  I would suggest the saag paneer.  As for the butter chicken, it's passable but I can't say it's the best I've ever had."}
{"text":"We love this place.  Lamb Vindaloo is spicy and flavourful.  We always go here when we are in thorn hill and want Indian food."}
{"text":"Interestingly enough, everybody acks their favorite restaurant, but gives only 4 stars. This restaurant is amazing!"}
{"text":"A pretty solid Indian restaurant, and definitely one of the best in the area. Don't expect a beautiful dining room here, but you will get excellently-prepared food. We ordered a few dishes, rice, naan and samosas to start. The samosas were nice and crispy, although a bit lacking in spice. The naan was fresh and warm. It was generally fluffier than most places, which I liked. The dishes were absolutely delicious! Butter chicken and saag paneer; pretty safe bets when going to a new place, but these were exceptional. Very flavourful and fresh-tasting.  All-in-all this is a great place. The service could be speedier, but the servers were very polite. I'd like to try their lunch buffet to compare the quality to the a-la-carte menu items.   Oh, and had a mango lassi, which was awesome!"}
{"text":"The food was really good, we had the butter chicken and the kadai gosht. The butter chicken was made to perfection and the kadai gosht was very soft and tender. Would love to go back here.  Like other Indian restaurants the portions are pretty big and prices are good. Of course we had left overs and had it in the morning.   The ambiance was clean and nice and the waiter was very friendly. He recommended coming for the buffet lunch. Only $10 I think."}
{"text":"The quality of the food is really good. The restaurant has a nice ambience and is well decorated. The staff were friendly and the service was good. The food came out really fast. Private parking lot off of Yonge St. was a plus. The only reason the place was not 5 stars is because of the price to portion ratio."}
{"text":"Had the lunch buffet for 10.99 today, excellent value. Restaurant is in a strip plaza with ample parking. Variety was not bad, I particularly enjoyed the pakora, butter chicken, cauliflower, naan bread and sliced papaya for dessert. I didn't find any of the food spicy at all which was too bad. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Since my earlier review, prices for the buffet are up, which is sort of understandable. However they have cut back on the fancy buffet dishes (like eggplant) and are focussing on the cheaper ones (like curried carrots or potatos). Not a positive omen. They are also cutting back on spices, another warning sign. If you find a properly spiced dish in the buffet it is likely by complete accident. Their chicken dishes however remain superior to most other Indian buffets."}
{"text":"Indian Kitchen provided me with a satisfying meal that scratched my brown itch quite nicely.  Service was kinda rude at the start but they eventually warmed up and were pretty friendly by the end of our meal.  The chicken tikka, saag and butter chicken were rich with flavour and delicious.  The chicken itself wasn't as tender as I would have liked, but very rarely am I happy with the chicken I find in curries at restaurants.  The garlic naan was piping hot, baked to perfection and oh so damn good at moping up loose bits of rice and murky pools of sauce.  I'm happy with my experience here, would have no problems coming back.  Wish they delivered."}
{"text":"Blows everest outta the water. they have an amazing chef. seriously. i eat a lot of indian food and i'm fussy, but there is just so much care in this beautiful food. been 4 times in the last month, both for buffet lunch and regular dinner service. both are impressive. their buffet butter chicken is boneless and tandoori roasted first and utterly succulent, unlike everest's, which is grisly and on-the-bone. they have way more salads and condiments, plus they vary the items so it's not the same thing every day. great onion bhaji, beef curry, and inspired vegetable dishes. the butternut squash coriander curry i had today was to-die-for. GO!"}
{"text":"Amazing restaurant. Staff are very friendly and the food is great. Always fresh. I HIGHLY recommend the lunchtime buffet. Naan is also the best I've ever had. Fluffy and buttery,"}
{"text":"For the $9.99 price of the lunch buffet, this place is quite good value.   Not very tidy or super clean but quite alright overall. The food, considering it's a buffet, is actually quite ok. The chicken used for tandoori is of very good quality and makes for a tasty meal.  Service is friendly if not very professional but then again remember how much you are paying before any complaints.   Overall a decent experience with a good enough variety of Indian cuisine."}
{"text":"Great Indian food.Not much to tell, just good food, kind staff, and fair prices. A must if you are in the neighborhood!"}
{"text":"This is the best Indian food I've ever had and I've been to over 50 Indian restaurants!  So many dishes are amazing but the standout dishes for me are the tandoori chicken (best anywhere), the fluffy naan, the great eggplant, and the tikka multani.  You really can't go wrong with any dish here.  The $9.99 lunch buffet is an amazing deal!  The decor is a little dated, but the staff is friendly and the food quality can't be beat!"}
{"text":"Bar none, this is the best Indian food in the WORLD.  I've tried acclaimed Indian restaurants in New Delhi, Agra, Lucknow, Mumbai, Brick Lane and Southall in London, 10th Arrondissement in Paris, Murray Hill aka Curry Hill in Manhattan etc and nothing comes close to Indian Kitchen - no exaggeration.  Prince Charles' favorite curry house Aladin on Brick Lane is like eating at McDonalds compared to this place.  They have absolutely the best curries on earth, and I dare you to challenge me with a better spot, because I've been all over the world searching for it and I've yet to find it."}
{"text":"Ambience & decor: Contemporary, brightly lit. Beverage: PREVIOUSLY - This place had tasteless food, (some of it tasted like they had just opened frozen veggie packets & added some sauce), the worst gin & tonic I've ever had in their previous location off of Yonge street. We had not visited this place in a few years. We wanted to give it another try after seeing the Yelp star rating. They have moved to a different location on Yonge street close to the previous one. PRESENT- Looks like they have reinvented themselves! Their G&T was among the best I've had. Food & service: The food was freshly prepared, well spiced, standard North Indian & Punjabi fare. It was quite good. They have an interesting south Indian Madras Paneer which is very tasty & extremely spicy (you can request that they tone it down as it can become unpleasant after a few mouthfuls) which goes well with rice. Their aloo nan, which is a different twist on the paratha, was delicious. The bhindi was very flavorful & delicately spiced. Their Mughlai kofta was also a refreshing change from the usual malai kofta. Overall, a good, satisfying Desi restaurant you can stop for dinner or lunch especially on these negative temperature days."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place. DELICIOUS Tikka Masala and Garlic Naan. Service is always great, and delivered with a smile. Did I mention the Mango lasi is to die for??  I will keep coming here for my Indian food cravings!!!"}
{"text":"I have been to many Indian buffets, be it north or south Indian, and Indian Kitchen stands out as one of the best. Their Butter Chicken is creamy and delectable, the eggplant Baharta is absolutely savory with a perfect bite to it. Their Naan OMG the Naan, with that amazing butter garlic on it, the best Naan I've ever tasted. Their quantity of food is not so grand, but they Defently make up for it with quality of food. Customer service is always friendly and is eager to serve. Prices have gone up a bit, but not by much, it's still very reasonable. So enter once and leave a regular."}
{"text":"Not sure about lunch but went here for dinner and very small portions for the price. Pushy waiters. Won't go back"}
{"text":"Cheap and good for an all you can eat. Very spacious and big restaurant, though I've never seen this place packed. They have a select amount of curries and AYCE naan (the best part!). I love the butter chicken the most."}
{"text":"Great Indian place, most memorable was their fresh naan... mmm... service was quick and courteous however the only issue was when we were being seating, our server was being yelled at by another Indian family. Something about them only caring about the non-Indian folk and leaving their own people aside. Not sure what it was all about but it was quickly taken care of and soon after the food definitely made up for it!"}
{"text":"I just posted like a million pictures of the food.... I felt like the reviews needed more visuals.  Came here with my bestie boooboo on Monday night around 745-8. It's pretty easy to find (in the Ginza plaza, across the street from Britannia pub).  The interior is too much for my taste. It reminds me of a Soviet restaurant. I kept looking around for KGB agents and politburo members...  Waitress was really nice and helpful and the food came FAST... They gave us some king of rolled up, crispy cracker bread to munch on while we waited.   Ordered the lamb kebabs, tandoori chicken and palak paneer.  First of all, palak paneer was the best i've had so far. SO MUCH SPINACH AND CHEESE!!!!! Very spicy too? Delish.  Lamb kebobs were.... dry. Very very dry, did not enjoy.  Tandoori chicken was just the right spicy for me, soft, BIG, and looked beautiful.  We asked for extra marinated onions, they're so damn good!!! And roti. I made weird wraps, experimenting with the PP, onions and tamarind. Tehee..... I only play with my food when i'm getting ready to eat it!!!  It's close to home and easier to park than at the places around North York Center or Yonge and Sheppard so i might come back here, but not before trying other places!"}
{"text":"Food: went there for their lunch buffet. Pretty tasty food. For $10.99/adult and $6/child it's a steal! Butter chicken kids loved. Freshly made naan when you sit down. All the other curries were tasty. If I want my Indian food fix, this is a good place to go. Dessert bar also include fresh fruit. Papaya was very interesting for the kids.   Staff: friendly and attentive.   Def will come back again."}
{"text":"This is a solid Indian place with good food and nice service. The vegetarian dishes we ordered were all excellent. The Paneer Madras was the spiciest Paneer dish I've ever eaten - delicious. We also ordered Mughlai Kofta and Bhindi masala. They were both delicately spiced and delectable. Finally I ordered an Alu Naan which was really interesting and very tasty. They have a large but rather sparsely decorated space. But that does not detract from the great food."}
{"text":"The Indian Kitchen looked a little sketchy from the outside, but the insides are fine enough.  Good service (helped by the fact that my friends and I were the only ones in the restaurant at 5:30PM on a Thursday), affordable prices (15% student discount!) and delicious food.   The Indian Kitchen has definitely converted me into a fan of Indian cuisine, and I definitely look forward to to eating here again!"}
{"text":"Came here today for lunch buffet after seeing the good Yelp ratings.  Was disappointed it wasn't as good as expected.  Paneer was a bit tough and dry, tandori chicken was boiled and then baked, sauce was very rich so fills you up quickly.  It's more pricey than other Indian buffets with better food and selection."}
{"text":"I spotted the Indian Kitchen while looking for some place new to try, plus it was early and nobody else had opened yet.   The Indian Kitchen is located on Yonge street in Thornhill close to Steeles avenue.  I've spent a lot of time in this area over the years, but I don't remember eating here.  There is an amazing amount of seating at this restaurant. It has been nicely done up.  Nice tables, comfortable chairs, and a good menu with a large variety of items.  I have to eat a gluten free diet, and there are lots of options for me, and the waiter was knowledgeable on what I could and couldn't have.  The buffet was quite small, and the options were limited, but I order off of the menu typically anyways so this was not an issue for me.  The selections were Northern and Southern Indian in the menu, and some Goan items it appeared as well.  There may be other regional foods represented, but I saw what I wanted to eat.l and stopped looking.  I ordered their special lamb chops that are marinated in yogurt, ginger and fresh spices, and I also ordered the Krum Mutter Paneer which was served with fresh Ontario peas and mushrooms.  The Krum Mutter Paneer stole the show.  It was fantastic.  I will have it again.  Creamy, spicy, nice bold flavour of mushrooms and peas.  The lamb looked like it had a lot of promise, but when I picked up the four pieces one by one to eat, it became obvious that it had some issues. It was almost like a lamb lollipop, but not quite.  The meat had been hacked off of it and probably used in another dish.  The meat was close to the bone, and the tendon was difficult to chew as it was still quite rubbery.  The meat that was cooked was good, but the only way to eat it was to pick it up and try to tear the meat fro the bone and it was a lot of effort.  Good flavour for the most part, but the presentation needs some work, and I would prefer two to four pieces with more meat and less bone.  The restaurant also has a full bar, and some nice looking art as well.  Overall a good experience, and I will try it again and some other items off of the menu."}
{"text":"It is still a great place for dinner. Their lunch buffet is not that good, too bad they changed to buffet style, it was much better before."}
{"text":"A pleasant surprise! The hub and I were looking for something to eat in this area and thanks to our Yelp app we came across The Indian Kitchen. We drove past it a few times because it's hidden in a medical building/plaza. As soon as we walked in the staff was very courteous, right away we were served water and  papadoms. The menu has a large variety of dishes, and we decided to order the butter chicken (a little too sweet for my taste but very juicy), and the lamb curry (very spicy but good taste), with both rice and naan. As per the hub, this is the best naan in the city, and I especially liked the rice which was cooked to perfection. We will certainly be returning."}
{"text":"Pros: Very well made food 10% discount on take out if paying by cash  Cons: Environment outside not too safe  Originally, I was going to the Persian supermarket next door for take out.  As I spent 5 minutes not being acknowledged I took my business elsewhere. Luckily for me, this place was right next door.  Indian food is always a favourite of mine so getting to try a new place is always a good thing for me.    This review focuses on their take out service.  I have not dined in here yet but that will change soon hopefully.  For take out, I always get a butter chicken dish no matter what.  It's basically the standard I use for reviewing Indian restaurants.  If they make a good butter chicken, they're great in my books. A korma of either beef or lamb is my other go to.  Couple with a an order or 2 of naan bread and your'e good to go.  When you pay in cash for your take out order, you will get a 10% discount.  The food gets to you pretty quickly.  I was expecting a longer wait time just coming in out of the blue and ordering.  You can definitely call in and order ahead of time to save you time.  When you take out, you get your dishes in a styrofoam container that's smaller than most containers other Indian restaurants I've been to.  However, Indian Kitchen gives you much more meat in the dishes that I'm used to.  I've had some places give me 5-6 pieces of chicken in a butter chicken.  There had to be at least 10+ pieces in this one.  The taste was really good too.  One of the better butter chicken and korma I've had for sure.  I was definitely very impressed.    All in all, I really liked my experience.  I would definitely consider dining in there.  I've seen the bad reviews about the lunch buffet.  When you have a buffet at about $10, you can't expect the world.  I'm sure if I come in for dinner at regular prices I will be fine."}
{"text":"Have been here couple of times and usually I was really happy about the lunch buffet ($10.99) with many dishes available (including Saag Aloo, Matar Paneer, Chana Masala and Butter Chicken) and even more - the dinner. But this last time the buffet was pretty disappointing. Not sure if it's often like this we were just unlucky. We arrived at 2:00pm (lunch buffet is closing at 2:30pm) and some dishes (including rice and salads) were already (or almost) empty, not re- filled. Only Butter Chicken was re-filled at 2:25pm when we were ready to leave. Some people arrived, put down their jackets, but when they saw the empty buffet dishes, they said \"we changed our mind\" and left. The manager and waiter did not care about it, did not ask why they are leaving. Aside from dishes being empty, the food was very oily. For example meat dishes were swimming in oil! It looked non appetizing. I know that most places re-fill their dishes and keep mixing sauces so they at least look better. And, even the service is not the friendliest here. We really wanted to come back here because we had great dinner dishes here (Saag Paneer and Butter Chicken) but when you order from menu, may be different quality than when you choose buffet). The bottom line - we are not coming back for lunch here."}
{"text":"This is a solid Indian place in Thornhill. Everything we ordered was great, but the standouts were the Murgh Tikka Lababdar, and the naan. As silly as it is to say the standout was the naan, but it was really great. It was crispy on the outside, yeti fluffy on the inside. And it wasn't the limp and lifeless stuff that you find at some Indian Restaurants. The Murgh Tikka Lababdar is a chicken dish, very similar to a Butter Chicken, but the chicken is par-broiled first and is covered in spices similar to the ones you'd see on a tandoori chicken I believe. The chicken was quality white meat. The best thing about the dish though was the well balanced sauce, which to me is impressive because of all the flavours that are in Indian food. I could have ate just a vat of that sauce. We also ordered the Saag Paneer, and Peas Pulao as well. The peas pulao is nice if you want something more than just a plain rice dish. And I love paneer, so you can't go wrong with ordering it! The only thing I didn't enjoy was the complimentary papadam... it really sticks in your teeth! I would love to come back and try their 9.99 lunch buffet because the food at dinner time was of exceptional quality. And the portions were good as I was stuffed afterwards."}
{"text":"This is a great Once-In-A-While place to eat.  The service is OK at best and the food is what brings you back.   The Naan is fresh and delicious. They offer a lot of different types of food and different types of fish (which is a big deal for me), not to mention vegetarian options as well.  I wouldn't recommend the buffet. But it's a nice night out with the family for sure!"}
{"text":"Guys I have been to many Indian buffets this by far is he worst.   The taste is so bland and very little variety for a lunch buffet. For crying out loud they don't even have ice cream.   No variety at all very basic and no taste. Only reason this gets two stars is bc the decoration and ambiance period."}
{"text":"Amazing food for the buffet. one large table and they have a nice variety for a cheap price. I think less than $15 after tax for the buffet at lunch?"}
{"text":"This is hands down the best Indian restaurant in Toronto right now. If you haven't tried this place out yet, this is what you're in for:  1) The best tandoori chicken and kebabs...and they serve it on a sizzling platter. It's fresh and not pre-cooked which I find most Indian restaurants do.  2) Amazing naan bread. The garlic naan is my favourite.  3) Insanely good butter chicken and saag paneer.   It's a family run business and the owner is authentic and nice and he's always here, which is a really good sign. You can tell he's passionate about his restaurant and it shows in the service and the food.  Also the washrooms are neat and clean (something I find always missing at every Indian restaurant).  Try this place, you won't regret it :)"}
{"text":"I have decided to try this spot for all you can eat lunch. The food is not cooked long enough for tenderness. Too much pepper and not Anouilh other spices . The butter chicken is the worst I had so far, the souse resemble water diluted pizza souse. So far the worst Indian buffet I have visited. Naan was good. Place is clean."}
{"text":"Excellent food quality( their veggie biryani and tandoori chicken are the best of Ontario I'd say), friendly staff, very clean and comfortable. It deserves 5 stars."}
{"text":"I will definitely recommend this place. Food was very tasty. Restaurant was very clean. Buffet has all what you need in order to taste Indian cuisine. Also price for a buffet was very attractive."}
{"text":"Friendly staff, clean space, and good food. It was better than I expected and interior is way better than the place look from outside. Food was pretty good too, I was happy for it. Price is bit pricey but considering the quality of food and clean space, I think it's pretty fair. I would recommend! :)"}
{"text":"One of the better Indian restaurants in the area. I thought the service was solid if not a bit slow and both the buffet and menu items are always very very good. They have all the usual suspects... Tikka masala, butter chicken, tandoori, etc and all are very well done. The waiters are very helpful and good about recommending new things for you to try if youre interested and so far from my experience everything has been very tasty and well made.  I saw that 1 star review about the rice and that is surprising... From my experience they are very attentive tot he customer."}
{"text":"Wow. Has this place deteriorated. We have been going here for many years but tonight was the last time I will ever set foot in this restaurant   I was shocked by the disgusting food they served and followed by the insanely rude attitude of the owner    There were six of us for dinner and we ordered three orders of lamb chops. Our usual go to item   The waiter brought the usual simmering plates but tonight hidden amongst the thick cut raw purple coloured onions were a bunch of bare skinny bones which looked like they came from the previous customers plate  What looked like chewed up chunks of a meat like substance was mixed in with the gravy   We asked the waiter what was wrong and he told us that this is what the supplier sends them and in future we should order boneless lamb as this is what they will be serving and they have had many complaints   Needless to say I sent that mush back and did not re order anything else. I was so disgusted   We got the bill and the waiter told us all he could do was discount us 10%. = to $6. As the chops were $14.95 and still on the bill I asked to speak to the owner.  He refused to come talk to us even though he was sitting alone in his empty restaurant playing on his cell phone   I went up to him and was immidiatelly yelled at and told me that he was sick and tired of \"YOU PEOPLE\"? Complaining and doesn't care if we. One back or not.  I was shocked at his disgusting attitude   I warn all of you that it is not worth going in there again. There are many  other restaurants on the area that \"us people\" can spend our money at and enjoy good food and decent service. STAY AWAY FROM THE INDIAN KITCHEN."}
