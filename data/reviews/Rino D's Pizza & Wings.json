{"text":"After reading the reviews I was pretty disappointed in the pizza. To me, the sauce tasted like Spaghettios. The crust was nice and thin and crispy but I couldn't eat even a whole slice because I just didn't like the sauce at all. My son had the Philly Cheesesteak and he said it was pretty good. But, we probably won't order from here again."}
{"text":"Favorite local pizza place. It's ruined most other pizza for me. And I have gotten all my friends hooked! I moved out of there delivery zone but we still don't mind making the trip for the pizza! Pizza! Get in my belly!"}
{"text":"we love the pizza and wings here. especially the BBQ chicken pizza. the customer service is always on point and always delivering with a smile here. Me and my husband have no issue with the 15 min drive to get these types of experiences. i also signed up for their email program and was notified for a 50% off a pizza for our wedding anniversary. thanks for the reminder and the offer. we love you guys"}
{"text":"I've been driving by Rino D's for years this was the first time I actually ordered from them. I ordered a few hours ahead of time so it would be ready while I was out and about getting some stuff done. Food was ready on time, the service was great, everything I order was warm and was fantastic. I'll have to try it again soon."}
{"text":"I have been getting pizza here for years. For a very long time I got the same order.the price kept going up and up, but since we liked there food we paid it. So recently to save some money we changed our order from a large to a medium pizza. Our previous bill was about 41.00. Doing this dropped our bill to about 32.00 it then went to 34.oo dollars and last week and this week it went to 39.00. My opinion. ... they will do what ever it takes to get there hand in you pocket.  When I asked why it went up 5.00 they told me it was the delivery fee, when I said I paid 34.00 last week with a delivery fee are you charging me 2 delivery fees... they changed it and said it was for the chicken nuggets.  Well before we got 7-9 nuggets they said we can only get 6 or 12. We ordered 12 . So 5 dollars for 3 nuggets. You lost us, our money and our respect. I don't and won't recommend you to anyone anymore"}
{"text":"We recently had Rino D's serve our Employee Appreciation Event for lunch for approx 300 employees @ Adesa. The food was a huge hit and the service was incredible. The owner was very responsive and willing to help us with all our catering questions and needs. The food came on time, was hot, and we received flawless service.  The Margherita is an all-time favorite with several people here and they only use the freshest ingredients. You can taste the difference! Thanks again for excellent service and the best pizza in the east valley! :)"}
{"text":"Absolutely LOVE this place, we order here way too much. Awesome customer service and always on time with delivery. One time my food was taking too long, I was called back and offered a free 2-liter for the inconvenience. Love it!!"}
{"text":"The pizza is yummy! The price is right and the food is always hot when it is delivered. I've tried several items off the menu and have not been disappointed yet. We will keep coming back."}
{"text":"Rino D's is a great place to get pizza, I love their Margarita Pizza its so amazing. I would recommend to everyone who is in a craving for pizza to try this place out. There sauce is very light and delicious, I usually order a X-Large and it's satisfying without feeling full. Their chicken wings are great too and not as saucy as most places are, they have the right touch."}
{"text":"Order the margherita pizza and topp with italian sausage...  Can't go wrong.  Always good, but Spinatoes super 6 has them beat for best pizza in valley..."}
{"text":"Me and family love this place. Have been coming here for years. The Margarita pizza is amazing. My fav of thier pizza's. The best thing i love ordering and my family are the wings. I always get 1 large of hot and i large 1/2 Honey bbq and the rest hot. The sauce they use for the hot wings is amazing. My favorite spot for wings and Margarita pizza. Going there tonight for some wings."}
{"text":"We've ordered from at least 10 places around us because we like to try new pizza but what can I say, Rino's beats them every time. It's always delivered HOT and delicious. I wish I could get a pic but nuh-uh. Everything is GONE as soon as it's cool enough to eat. I can't believe the chains are even still in business with places like this around! It is really, really good."}
{"text":"always great service and better than average pie! definite step up over the chains and i'm one to always support local businesses as long as its a great product. Rino's is a GREAT place."}
{"text":"Rino D's is some good stuff. My wife and I recently moved in to an apartment nearby and in our welcome packet was a menu for Rino D's. We ordered once and haven't looked back. I'm a wing snob, I was spoiled by a great wing joint in Utah and until Rino D's I hadn't been able to find wings that would satisfy the cravings. My wife adores their pizza and if our budget allowed we'd probably have Rino D's weekly. The staff has been friendly and deliveries prompt. These guys are top notch."}
{"text":"Great Pizza always fresh ingredients, the Margarita Pizza is my favorite. Their wings are big and meaty. Wonderful wonderful place to eat."}
{"text":"Simply the best delivered pizza in the area. Wife and I typically just order a pepperoni (she is picky) which can get boring from chains... But Rino D's sauce and cheese is so good I don't even whine about not getting the extra toppings I usually want. The wings are superb as far as delivery goes."}
{"text":"Great pizza here!  Saucy pizza and hearty sausage!  Very happy with this recent lunch option. On their website they have daily specials.  Good prices, great special and great pizza.  What more could you want? :)"}
{"text":"As a New York native I find it hard to find GOOD pizza and wings here (no offense!). Rino D's helped me get my fix for sure!  The garlic crust was amazing!  Sauce was the perfect balance of flavors, and the wings were juicy and meaty!!!  You have yourself a new regular customer!  Kudos"}
{"text":"Rino D's is robably the best taste/value proposition in its 4 mile radius. Much better than the delivery chains (Dominos/Papa Johns etc.) for not much more money. Key to good pizza is a tasty crust and they don't disappoint. The meats and toppings are of decent quality and a good ratio. It's better than most restaurant chain pizza as well. A good mix is wings from Native New Yorker and pizza from here. The wings here are generic with generic sauce, ranging from nothing special to too tough."}
{"text":"Very yummy! We got the cheese pizza and it was delicious and piping hot! Delivery was very quick considering I live at the heart of Downtown Gilbert and it's Saturday night. I will definitely order from here again!"}
{"text":"Ordered through grub hub. Ordered the wings extra crispy. They came not so crispy. I called. No argument. Excellent customer service. They delivered new ones right away. No ones perfect but glad they made it right!"}
{"text":"I ordered from Rino D's once after they left an ad/coupons on my door.  The pizza basically tasted like Pizza Hut.  It was edible, but not great.  The delivery guy was surly and, this may just be a coincidence, but immediately after using my AmEx card to order from Rino D's, I started seeing fraudulent charges.  The pizza certainly wasn't good enough to try it again, with or without the credit card fraud."}
{"text":"Honestly the best pizza ever! So happy it's close to home. They always have great deals and deliver very quickly. I absolutely love it! We have tried other things on their menu but the pizza is the best."}
{"text":"We had a party of 8 and ordered 2 large specialty pizzas plus wings. Everything was really tasty and the staff was super friendly and helpful. Our food came quick and we all enjoyed it. The only reason I'm giving 4 stars is because there were only 8 seats in the seating area. People coming in and out to pick up their orders had to walk between our family. It made for difficult conversation. Other than that, it was great!"}
{"text":"We ordered food over the phone around 9:30, they close at 10. They said it would be ready in about 15 to 20 minutes, we got there in about 20. When I walked in, nobody greeted me, I walked up to the counter and the cashier simply told me what I owed. A manager came out and said to me \"hey, what's your name?\" I told him and then he said \"It's getting late.\" So unprofessional and terrible customer service. I understood that they were closing soon, I'm a server so I understand. Which is why I ordered to go. Overall, the staff was extremely rude. But I'm giving an extra star because the food was really good, if it weren't I would not be going back."}
{"text":"I LOVE the pizza here! Even better though are their WINGS! I have been going to Rino D's for as long as i can remember! I have never been dissatisfied when i have gone! They really do not have much of a sit-down and eat. Either get it for pick up or delivery. If you are looking for a new pizza places or just GREAT pizza Rino D's is the spot!"}
{"text":"Ooo ya! Amazing white pizza; sausage, artichokes and mushrooms! I will order that again! They delivered when they said they would and the delivery fee is only $2.50. Thank you!"}
{"text":"My favorite pizza joint in the east valley!  The rewards program is great so sign up.  Get a free pizza after every few orders...     Ingredients are always fresh and it has been consistently good for the last 7 years I've been a patron.   It is delivery or take out only!"}
{"text":"really good pizza, great service.  We ordered a roasted garlic pie, and were surprised to see whole gloves of roasted garlic on the pizza, as we usually get slices or chopped garlic.  The garlic was soft and sweet and gave a great flavor to the pizza.Also got a half mushroom, half roasted peppers. The mushrooms were fresh and tasty and the peppers were great. the crust was crispy, even my son ate it and he doesnt usually eat crust. if it a little drive from our house, but may be worth the trip again."}
{"text":"The quality was just not there for me. Pizza tasted like something you would get in a elementary school cafeteria. Cheese was congealed into a weird single layer that was not stringy and softly melted. I was not feeling the over use of dried Italian herbs that sprinkled everywhere over the pizza. The crust was really disappointing, bland, and didn't have the crunch with a chewiness I was yearning for. Only reason I didn't give them 1 star was the wings that we order were pretty good."}
{"text":"The wings were the best, I tried them a few months back, and I came today for their pizza deal. It was cheesy and good. The sauce was very tasty. They put in the care that only family shops can offer. Definitely recommend it."}
{"text":"So I was looking to get a fix for my wing habit and since I just moved to the area, I'm still not sure where I should be going... so I thought I would try having Rino D's deliver a dozen hot wings.  Price - Ended up being about $25 for a dozen wings to be delivered. A bit high I think given the quality of the wings...  Service - Prompt delivery and the people I dealt with at the restaurant were friendly and preliminarily helpful...  Food - I say preliminarily helpful in that what I like to ask is for wings that are cooked, then dipped and then ideally grilled. They don't have a grill so that wasn't available... but this isn't an issue - not every place has a grill. However, another thing I like to ask for is \"drums only\" and I'll pay extra for that.. and the person helping me assured me that they could do that. When they arrived however... I had a number of flats in there as well. As far as taste is concerned... perfectly servicable, no issues - I just know that there are places locally that have must more interesting and delicious flavors for your money.  In my opinion, this place if fairly average with regards to wings, price, service and taste... so while you wouldn't be making a mistake to come here... there are certainly other places around that are a better value for great food."}
{"text":"Ordered thru yelp as usual... Somehow it was sent as a pick up order. I have no way to pick up... So I called the restaurant, they made a crazy big deal out of changing it to delivery. Had to contact yelp (eat 24) customer service who said they would take care of it... Too much b.s. already? Wait! 1.5 hours later my pizza never arrived so I called the establishment again who told Me they didn't even have my order anymore. It wasn't made, it wasn't on its way! They told me to call eat24 again. They offered to take my order again but I would have to pay, AGAIN! EXCUSE ME! no never."}
{"text":"We love pizza, my husband is from NY so we are always looking for a good place to try. Rino D's definitely delivers on major flavor and a perfect crust! We love the Greek pizza and all the Mediterranean flavors it brings just remember get extra tzatziki sauce  The pesto bread is amazing and very rustic you can tell they use real mozzarella. We will be back soon for sure!"}
{"text":"We love Rino Ds. We've been ordering once or twice a month for the 11 years we've lived in Gilbert. We normally order the large calzones, one gyro meat and feta, one green pepper and onion, no red sauce, delivery. The order is always correct, and they're absolutely consistent. Never had s bad meal or an incorrect order."}
{"text":"This was more of a 3.5 start experience as far as taste goes, but I'll round up for good prices, quick service and aesthetics.  Seriously, check out the picture of my pizza. What a good looking margherita! I was surpised how scrumptious it looked coming from a tiny strip mall place.  Overall, the taste was good but didn't blow me away. My favorite parts were the delicious, high quality cheese and heavy dose of garlic. The sweet sauce and thicker crust reminded me of a stepped-up Domino's."}
{"text":"As far as the wings and bar food go, it's alright, but the actual Pizza, pasta, calzones, etc.  BEST PLACE EVER.  I'm a huge pizza snob and Rino's pizza makes me want to savor every bite (because it's really not cheap). So I tend to only order here if it's a special occasion (today's my anniversary)  Get the Margherita. It's topped with so much stuff. Not like those other places that give you a thin slice of tomato and cheese on some mediocre crust, Rino's actually fills you up and has amazing flavor, not bland at all. Their crust is the best too. I never eat pizza crust, but I eat every morsel of Rino's."}
{"text":"The pizza is pretty good, but what I really like here were the wings. I'm more of a pizza man, and really don't like wings all that much. However, I really like the wings here. They are nice and crunchy and not to hot. Even the hot were mild at best but very good."}
{"text":"I ordered here last night for the first time and it was really good. I like having more than 1 place to choose from and this will deforest be added to our family choices. I ordered the mini with pesto sauces, pepperoni and sausage and it was delicious! The crust was flaky-think puff pasty-and the pesto had a great flavor. It wasn't too salty as some can be and the toppings were plentiful. We also ordered a large pizza and that was eaten by my kids and husband in record time! We will definitely be ordering from them again, or even stopping by and eating in! Keep up the great food."}
{"text":"Got a 14\" pizza with extra sauce and buttery crust. We are picky with pizza and this place did not let is down. The crust is amazing. The sauce is more of a sweeter style sauce and is very good. The tiramisu for a pizza joint was not bad either! Will be back for sure."}
{"text":"First time getting pizza from here. Wife and I really enjoyed it! Loved the flavor of the sausage and their pesto sauce pizza was very good. Great customer service upon arrival for pick up. Excited to have such a good place that's close!"}
{"text":"I love the supreme pizze here, we always order delivery and they've never been late. The wings are AWESOME. The only reason why they got 4 out of 5 stars is because the last time they delievered, they brought BBQ chicken wings instead of the hot wings I ordered. Otherwise, they are pretty friendly and fast. I get a craving just talking about it..."}
{"text":"I will definitely order from here from now on. I was impressed with the overall outcome. The delivery time was great, about 30 mins. Delivery boy was very courteous. I paid through Yelp and it was all very easy. My total for my order (everything below) was the same price as Papa Johns except much better, better options, included tip and got twice as much.. so way better deal!  Ordered:  Pepperoni pizza - it was ok. Flavor was good, but cheese slipped off a little. Not greasy!  Margarita pizza - I enjoyed this very much. It had a good amount of flavor, uniquely made, and very light feeling.   Chicken/white sauce pizza - also very good, included some of my own additions. Very simple to do  Cheesecake - thumbs up!  Moose cake - I didn't care for, but my daughter did!"}
{"text":"Stopped in here because I was craving pizza and was not disappointed. As an added bonus I had joined their rewards club and got 50% off my first pizza (any size)!   I ordered the much talked about margherita pizza and it was delicious! The real mozzarella cheese was centered on every piece and the tomato sauce was perfectly sweet, but not too sweet. It was a really great tasting pizza! The crust, though, was the highlight. I got the garlic butter and I don't think I've ever tasted anything so good in my whole life. Wow. Nicely salted and buttery with a crunchy, yet chewy crust. I almost could have wiped all the toppings off and still been completely satisfied. Yum!  I guess the four stars was because I didn't really get the punch I like from my first taste of a new pizza. Like I needed more of a intensity. Like another reviewer said (and I am completely paraphrasing) it's like Domino's on crack (totally paraphrased).   It was good, good, good pizza, the crust was the shining star and the fresh whole milk mozzarella was such a good taste along with the sauce, I guess I really did just feel like it should have been...more.   I'll be back, though, don't worry about that. It's some really good pizza!"}
{"text":"My wife and I are pizza snobs.  We've tried A LOT of pizza places in the 10 years we've lived here and NO ONE compares to Rino D's.  They are just that good.    We love the white pizzas and the chicken pesto.  They have good appetizers and the deserts are good.  The calzones are pretty good too, just a touch greasy.  We always order delivery.  They get here pretty fast (of course we live just a couple blocks away).    I love all the coupons they have and their rewards program is awesome.  I've never received so many free pizzas anywhere in my life.   Their delivery drivers are very nice, friendly and polite.  I highly recommend them.  But taste around first if you must.  You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"This is basically fast food. Not Italian food. The chicken parm was chicken tenders (frozen, store bought?) smothered in sweet jar sauce with some shredded cheese on top. It gave me a migraine-telltale sign of MSG. I asked for oil and vinegar for my salad because I'm trying to avoid preservatives. They don't have oil and vinegar. What Italian restaurant doesn't have oil and vinegar?!  Even the pizza was gross. My kids wouldn't eat it. Reminded me of Pizza Hut or dominoes. Not what I expect from this type of place."}
{"text":"I ordered this for my family on Friday.  The crust had a very nice crunch and texture. Not too thick and not too thin. We ordered pepperoni  mushrooms  and onions.  There was also a nice sprinkle of Italian herbs  over the pie. Definitely will order from here again!"}
{"text":"First off, know that this place is really more for take-out and delivery.  The couple tables seem more for waiting...it's really small and not particularly decorated.  But I ate here, as it was convenient.  I ordered 12 hot wings (can't get a smaller order) and 6 fried mozzarella sticks.  They give everyone their order like it's to-go, so mine came in boxes in a bag.  The wings were nice and hot...waited for them to cool down.   The fried mozzarella were good in that the cheese was nice and hot and gooey...something I could thoroughly enjoy as I ate them there.  However, the breading wasn't very tasty, and they seemed too perfectly similar to have been made there.  The marinara served with them was quite good, which would bode well for their pizzas.  The wings were flavored like Frank's Hot Sauce, with plenty of sauce.  Nice and hot in temperature, with enough meat on them, these were delish.  Most places fry their wings.  I couldn't tell for sure, as the skin had a slight crispiness, but didn't taste fried.  But I found out that they were.    So, basically, I was impressed and will return to try their (takeout) pizza!"}
{"text":"Perfect pizza crust - I almost died eating this pizza it was so---- good. I don't love pizza and for me to say this is the best pizza I have had in a long time is really something! Friendly people and easy to order and take out from. A real treat we found via Yelp.   You want great pizza? Look no further."}
{"text":"The margherita pizza itself was about 3.5 stars, but the quick service and low prices make this a four star restaurant for me.  I look forward to trying the wings and additional specialty pizzas on my next trip."}
{"text":"Rino D's is where it's at! Their food is amazing! I only order through them! Delivery is always on time or earlier. They have the best customer service also. Thank you Rino D's!!"}
{"text":"Great pizza and wings, always use for delivery, definitely a step above the rest!"}
{"text":"Loooove this pizza. Buffalo chicken pizza is my favorite. I usually do carry out because I live  right down the street and they've never taken more than 20 minutes to have my order ready. Online ordering is easy to use too."}
{"text":"Just had delivery from rino d's. SUPERB!  Both my wife and I work in the restaurant biz ( I'm a lead cook at a local casino and she heads up the kitchen at a local gastro-pub). We don't usually get to spend a dinner with each other and the kids, but when we do we want a good meal, and that usually means I cook it :) (jab at the wife) I didn't want to cook tonight, and we have a rare occurance of coinciding evenings off, and she wanted salad and I wanted pizza. I've ordered from here before so I knew they had both. After showing her the menu online, she wanted ' EVERYTHING' , but was hesitant about the fried apps getting here crispy ( you know how hard it is to box a hot crispy popper and have it not soggy from the steam after a 20 minute delivery) After convincing, we ordered the poppers, fried zucchini, Mediterranean pizza and anti pasta salad. The phone operator (name unsure, but whoever it was @ 5PM on 8-28-13) was very knowledgable and accommodating. I asked if they had a cucumber ranch for the fried zucchini, an she said ' no, but we do have a tzatziki' ( prolly for a gyro, not sure) not many phone operators could relate the two. I was impressed. Finally, the food arrived, all is amazing, the fried food my wife was hesitant about is still crispy ( almost like the cooks knew it was for delivery and to cook it just that little bit more, perfectly) and we are happy.   So much so that we're looking for a babysitter :)."}
{"text":"I ordered a Mexican pizza thinking it was taco pizza for some reason. This pizza gave me horrible heart burn from the many jalapeños, and it wasn't tasty. The crust was the best part of the pizza."}
{"text":"Tried Rino D's for the first time tonight. Great Pie! My new pizza place for delivery.  Fast delivery, and hot... the wife said the gluten free crust was great. Well done guys!"}
{"text":"The very best wings any where. Other items are great but they win the wing challenge hands-down. Been getting food there over 15 years, constantly excellent."}
{"text":"Not bad, but not really special. BUT it's super cheap if you need to feed a lot of people this is your spot."}
{"text":"Let me begin by saying I am from out of town and ordered from here on a whim to have delivered to our hotel and the pizza was fantastic which is the ONLY reason they are getting any stars at all. We had ordered a pizza, salad, and mozzarella sticks after traveling all and not wanting to leave to get food. Excited to finally eat we realize they delivered our food with no plates, forks, napkins, knives, cheese, peppers, NOTHING but our food!! Mind you I didn't notice until the delivery guy had already left and yes I tipped him. I call back right away to let them know that that they delivered a salad, a freaking salad with no fork or anything. The guy asks if I would like someone to come back and give us utensils I tell him yes I tipped the guy that would be great. A few moments later the front desk from the hotel knocks on the door and brings us 1 yes 1 plastic fork!!! These people called the hotel after I called them and asked them the front desk if they could bring me up a fork!!!! ARE YOU KIDDING ME???? Good thing I don't live here because I would never order from there again out of pure principle!!!!"}
{"text":"Ordered 2 extra large pizzas...one Italian Style and one custom combo...instead of ordering online I called and spoke direct with the store.  Our Pizzas were delicious and we will definitely be dining in or use order by phone takeout. I loved that I could ask for toppings placed on top the cheese layer so they are roasted and have sauce and cheese extend to the border. These are the best pizzas ever!  I Highly recommend this restaurant and look forward to trying other menu items."}
{"text":"Best pizza & wings in the East Valley.  The sausage white pizza melts in your mouth.  So delicious.  If you're in the mood for wings, they're big and cooked to perfection.  Whenever ordering, don't forget to treat yourself to the fried mushrooms.  Not many places carry them anymore, but Rino D's has them down to perfection.  Pizza is a 10, wings are a 10 and the appetizers are also perfect.  Kudos to this team for all of their hard work.  Even the delivery is right on time!"}
{"text":"We absolutely love this place! Every pizza is so flavorful. We have ordered many of the specialty pizzas and they all are amazing. When family is in town and we need to order pizza this is our place! Our guests always mention how flavorful the sauce is."}
{"text":"Best cheese pizza I have ever had! Jalapeno poppers are great too! Everything arrived hot and on time."}
{"text":"Great food, great service. My order came 10 mins early the pizza taste delish . The only one thing was I didn't get my tzatziki on the side which was actually selling point for me. I tried to call the driver back twice he didn't answer which I understood bc he was probably driving! but $23 for one pizza I expect the things I ordered with it to come as well."}
{"text":"Good food. Not really set up for eat in experience, so plan on doing take out if you come here. The staff were nice. The food was good for the price. I would highly recommend giving this place a try."}
{"text":"They have the best wings for delivery! Huge and juicy, I can compare them to buffalo wild wings.   They have the BEST PIZZA!  Fast and friendly delivery as well:)"}
{"text":"New to area I checked Yelp and ordered Rino D's for delivery. I ordered mushroom pepperoni and onion pepperoni and garlic bread. They delivered the pizza quickly and it was hot ! Garlic bread was ok but I really liked the pizza and it lasted me 2 days. Their pizza reheated is still delicious if using a convection oven. I spent $30 with tip. I highly recommend if you like good food!"}
{"text":"I LOVE LOVE LOVE their mini pizza's! The delivery is insanely fast! Great pizza and even better wings. :) Definitely a must if you're looking for good pizza on a budget."}
{"text":"First timer at this pizza joint! Called and ordered delivery for a medium (CHICKEN CORDON BLUE Chicken breast, ham, bacon, and zesty white garlic sauce & spices) I loved it! Also ordered a small order of wings wish a special request for wings only no drums... And they were very good too! I was told 40-45 minutes and I'm sure it arrived faster than expected. So over all I will keep coming back for more of that Cordon Blue pizza so good!"}
{"text":"Very fresh and great tasting pizza and wings. We friend the traditional wings with suicide sauce sloppy and crispy style. A different yet surprisingly delicious take on wings. Friendly and fast service."}
{"text":"Great pizza with made in store dough. Only tried their standard crust but plan to try the thick crust and some wings soon."}
{"text":"Best wings in the valley!  Fresh, NOT FROZEN!!  meaty wings.    Pizza good too, fresh dough, I like the thin crust the best.  People that work there are nice, and remember the regulars."}
{"text":"Having just moved to the Mesa area, the family and I have been looking for a new pizza place. Rino D's stands a good chance of being that place. We ordered a large pie and a dozen wild wings. The pizza was delicious. We ordered ham and green pepper as our toppings and there were generous amounts. The crust was thicker than some of the others I tried but it had nice chew and a good crunch. Also, their choice of sauce was very flavorful.   The wings are were ok. While they were juicy and crisp, their mild sauce seemingly broke and had this odd brownish tint to it. It wasn't appetizing. After the first six or so (which were, admittedly, tasty) we found this odd discoloration and stopped eating them.   All in all, we will try them again. If the wings are better that time, I'll definitely become a repeat customer."}
{"text":"Orderd 2 XL pizzas for my son's birthday. I was in a rush and just called this place they had it ready in no time. It was our first time eating their pizza, it was delicious! I have yet to try other types of pizza here bc my kids only care for the basic cheese, bacon and pepperoni. I hopefully will be writing a five star review when I try the other pizzas that everyone else is ranting about:)"}
{"text":"Pretty solid place. Tried the honey barbecue hot wings and the pepperoni and mushroom pizza. Have to say that it was good. Grew up right up the street from there and had never stopped in. I am kicking myself for not doing it sooner. Don't be a goober! Stop by and try this place out."}
{"text":"I have only had one chance to try this place for delivery and I was not disappointed. All of the food arrived hot and fresh. The pizza was surprisingly good for delivery food. I'll be back for seconds!"}
{"text":"I try to come here whenever I'm in the area. They have the biggest chicken tenders for a good price and they're always piping hot when I get them. The suicide sauce is my favorite. Going to try the pizza next time I'm around.  ----- My girlfriend and I got a 14 inch meat deluxe the last time we were in. Hands down the best pizza we've ever had. The pizza was stacked with toppings. Perfectly cooked thin and crispy bacon, with a quality ground beef in there as well. Amazing crispy and flakey yet soft dough/crust. This was after a 25 minute drive back to San Tan Valley before we could eat it. The kind young man that helped us offered us plates and napkins just in case we were going to eat there. Can't wait to try some pasta next time, wish there was another location out around queen creek. They would make a killing out here with the rapidly expanding community."}
{"text":"I ordered extra crunchy wings and a salad. The wings were cold when delivered and definitely not extra crispy. They also forgot the dressing for my salad."}
{"text":"My husband and I are huge fans of Rino D's. We order only about every month or so, but we've never been let down with our order. Other chains near us (I won't name names) that claim to be gourmet pizza places, have screwed up our orders more often than they've gotten them correct.  As for Rino D's, great wings, great salads and great pizzas! I can order an individual (mini) pizza with nearly 7 toppings for about $8.99! Their salads are customizable and better than most any other pizza place with delivery. Very consistent flavors and I highly recommend the Margharita pizza. Does not disappoint!"}
{"text":"Nice hole in the wall pizza place. Friendly staff. Good pizza. Take out only was a surprise. I didn't notice that till my wife and I got there but great to take home and eat. We will be back."}
{"text":"I've ordered delivery from Rino D's dozens of times. Every time, the order is exactly correct and delivered quickly! Everything I've eaten from there has been really good! I usually get pizza and wings or chicken strips. I've also had their fried zucchini and pasta dishes. It seems like they use fresh, high-quality ingredients and don't cut corners anywhere. I'm so glad I always can rely on Rino D's for a delicious dinner!"}
{"text":"I have considered this my favorite pizza place since 1998!! The food is TOP OF THE LINE and the service is even better! I love all employees and the owner, fantastic group of caring, considerate, fun people! I am never disappointed and it's the one place all my family from out of town looks forward to eating when they visit! Tasty crusts, juicy wings, incredible sauces... We love you guys!"}
{"text":"Outstanding pizza and wings! Ordered an incredible  supreme style pie. Toppings were fresh and crispy, great cheese and a wonderful sauce. Not too sweet and not too tangy. Crust was outstanding, perfectly done, not thick and not thin. Now, the wings. Got a dozen HOT. Wings were nice and big and the sauce was really nice. I'm a fan of HOT wings.  Not bbq wings or any of that crap. I asked for a side of SUICIDE sauce, and instead of a tiny little to go side, they gave us one of those small to go foil containers FULL of sauce! Perfectly coated all of our wings and had some left over sauce to put on anything else we cooked for the next day or so. THANK YOU FOR THE SAUCE! Will be coming back for sure! See you next pizza night Rino D's!"}
{"text":"Went here for the first time and figured out it is more to go than a sit down. So we ordered pizza and wings to go. The prices were awesome, the pizza was good, and the wings were meaty. I will definitely eat here again. It was nice to find a great to go place."}
{"text":"The only reason I don't give their pizza 5 stars is because I was born and raised in NY."}
{"text":"Our go-to for takeout pizza. The Napoli is our favorite, never disappoints! I usually don't eat pizza crust but I enjoy every bite of a Rino D's pizza. Their wings are great, too. The rewards program is awesome, but we'd keep coming back even without it. Everyone is always friendly and service is quick. Glad to have them so close to home!"}
{"text":"This is the best pizza in as their wings not so much but the pizza omg every one I've tried (most of the menus pizza) is unbelievably amazing I eat here at least 2 times a week"}
{"text":"My favorite pizza in Gilbert. The margherita pizza is my absolute favorite. A lot of people shy away of review negatively because their pizza is NOT like commercial pizza chains. It is fresh and delicious. They have pretty good specials as well. Definitely my go-to pizza place!"}
{"text":"The wings are not like they used to be seems like frozen cheap wings from Walmart and the prices went way up thx to new law of 10hr I've been ordering from here now for 5 years but I want be no more not worth the extra money the pizza was ok but not great like in the past"}
{"text":"My regular place was closed and Rino's had good reviews and was on the way home..ish. The reviews were right. Tried it a second time to make sure. Can't wait to finish it tonight. Half supreme and half Hawaiian. Seemed juicy?? My head chef thinks maybe pineapple juice on it? It works for me and she liked her half, so I'm happy."}
{"text":"I am a fan of pizza. Pizza all day, e'ry day. Interestingly enough I used to live just blocks away from this place and never knew it was there. Driving around one day I was hungry and stopped in. It is more of a call-ahead place and carry out. I didn't know that. I ordered the pizza and ate it there. They do have tables, but just a few. No television, so it's definitely not a hangout spot. I ordered a personal pizza, some wings, and a drink. I had the coke while waiting. Looking at the walls they were several awards from years past. Once the food came out and I took the first bite I wonder why the awards are not more current. It was excellent. The pizza had a good amount of toppings, it had a good firmness, excellent crust, and was everything I like in a pizza. The wings were excellent flavor too. This was one of the best pizzas I have had recently and will definitely order again. Only I will call ahead of carry out."}
{"text":"Rino D's is my favorite takeout Pizza & Wings takeout place. Always great pizza and wings. Prices are reasonable, but not low. The people are great and always get a helpful and positive response to any question. No dining in, but that is fine. When sports are on or time to order out/pick up, this is the place I always pick."}
{"text":"We always order pizza and pasta from Rino D's. Delish! It's the only place where we order pizza from..."}
{"text":"Great pizza and wings !! get delivery from here at least 3 times a month definitely recommend it"}
{"text":"Best pizza I've had in years. The crust is perfect, not too crunchy or too chewy or too greasy, and the sauce is equally well balanced. Also, do yourself a favor and try the Greek Salad."}
{"text":"Wings looked like they weren't done and pizza wasn't totally done kinda doughy for the amount we spent not to happy with it. The crust had a good flavor though. Order ceaser salad and the romaine was in huge chunks could cut smaller for the amount of dressing they gave with it. Spending $55 just wasn't worth it we want to try something different than the regular pizza places"}
{"text":"I saw this place on yelp, read the reviews, checked out the pics, and decided to give this place a try.  I decided to order from their website, on 11/30/15, and I had some difficulty choose from the various selections. There is a $12 minimum ordering. so I decided on a small Four Cheese pizza with a Caesar side salad.  The salad was average - what I expected.  The pizza was hot and freshly made.  The Gorgonzola was a little over powering. I would definitely try this place again, but order something different - maybe a sandwich and an appetizer."}
{"text":"I keep trying out other pizza places in this town, and although there are some I like better, they don't offer delivery. This is my 5 Star go to for delivery, always fast, always friendly, and the pizza is great."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying I don't like pizza anymore.  Most pizza is dry, dull and boring.  However the other day we had Rino D's Pizza at a staff meeting.  They have a pizza with chicken and white sauce that is incredibly good.  Its called Chicken Cordon Bleu.  I probably can't spell it but I can eat it.  It was the best pizza I have had in years.  Since it was a staff meeting, they had several varieties.  The others were good as well.  They had plenty of sauce and the flavor of the sauce was genuine.    Try the Chicken Cordon Bleu Pizza just once and you will be hooked."}
{"text":"When the missionaries from your church show up expecting dinner and you have no recollection of having invited them you can just go to Rino D's site and order a couple of XL pizzas. One with the works and one with pepperoni and mushrooms. Ready in exactly 15 mins and oh, by the way, delicious... That ought to hold em over for a couple hours. Thanks pizza guys!"}
{"text":"The cheeseburger pizza is incredible. Salads are heavy on lettuce and too expensive for what they are. Delivery can take a while, but it's worth the wait.  Overall a pretty good pizza joint."}
{"text":"Rino D's should be called Rino A+'s because they provide A++ service every time. We moved to the hood in January and theirs was the first meal we had in our new home. The pies are through and through some of the best. Flavorful crusts with truly wise toppings. The specialty pizzas are spot on and their wings are great. Fried mushrooms and zucchini make for a great addition to any order. We have only had delivery and they are always great on the phone and at the front door. Personal favorites are The Works and The Sausage Pesto pizzas. Delivery times are great and the food is always piping hot. If you don't order from Rino D's you are wrong and I pity your poor decision making."}
{"text":"We called and placed a delivery order about a week ago. I think someone by the name Eric answered the phone. We had a few questions and he was friendly and knowledgeable about the food. We used a coupon to order a medium one topping pizza, and an order of wings. The pizza was good and the wings were amazing! I also ordered a chicken tossed salad which at first I thought was expensive ($7,) until it arrived to my door. It was HUGE and tasty. I used to order from Venezias more frequently but they are more expensive so I will be ordering more often Rino D's in the future."}
{"text":"Rino D's and I go way back, to right when they first opened. They've been our family's go-to pizza place for over a decade (though NYPD has really brought it with regards to pizza) and we still hit Rino D's about once a month or every other month.  This has to be said: Rino D's has categorically the best hot wings in the valley. (And frankly, likely the entire state.) They are HUGE, with their delicious sauce (which I believe is based on the Frank's Red Hot original style, true to real wing form), and most importantly, they're perfectly cooked.  So many wings (I'm looking at you, Vine) are previously-frozen, dingy little sticks of sadness, slathered in sauce after the fact. Only Rino D's makes them perfectly, cooked in the sauce and then fried up properly. They're simply amazing, and they never freeze their chicken--it's their secret to success with the wings, and you honestly CAN. NOT. find better out here.  The pizza is a slightly more meddling affair. I'd recommend that you ask for it with thick crust (available on sizes up to large), and try their garlic butter crust flavoring. The pizza is damn decent, fresh, and well cooked, and the staff is always really nice. It doesn't scream out and grab me like NYPD's amazing pies do, but they're also slightly different in style.  All-in-all Andy & company have done amazing things with this tiny space. The wings are serious showstoppers. Get 'em hot and they'll ruin you for all other wings. The pizza is damn good, the prices are right, and the staff is fast and friendly. Great neighborhood pizza joint."}
{"text":"By far the best pizza I have had in AZ, and the wings are good too. Pizza sauce is what makes the difference, and they use good cheese so its not oily or greasy. Yummmms."}
{"text":"I was looking for something a little different than the usual pizza places. I found this place online and decided to order their supreme pizza.  WOW! Best pizza that I have ever had, and I have had a lot :p The crust was super soft with a little crip on the edges, and not too thick! The sauce just the right amount . TONS of cheese and I didn't even order extra cheese. Give it a try, you will be hooked."}
{"text":"Seriously good pizza! They have a really good deal on Mondays for two large one toppings for $15. The jalapeño poppers and fried zucchini were good as well. Only have it four stars because the boneless wings had a couple of chewy pieces and maybe I'm weird, but I'm very picky about my chicken."}
{"text":"Have fallen in love with their White Pizza with chicken on garlic butter crust! Highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Yo! This place is hands down THE BEST PIZZA EVER! Seriously. Their ingredients are as fresh as it gets, their staff is friendly and helpful, and can we take a moment to talk about their homemade hot sauce? Do yourself a favor and stop reading reviews, pick up the phone, and try for yourself! They have an XL deal that can't be beat, AND a loyalty club with rewards and perks! They gave even gave my husband and I a \"happy anniversary\" coupon! We love Rino D's!"}
{"text":"Very good pizza!  Good ingredients, awesome crust and friendly service.  Highly recommend to anybody.  Can easily see this turning into my \"pizza spot\"..."}
{"text":"We got the white veggie pizza with added bacon and it was probably one of my favorite pizzas I have had. It was so good!! This is definitely our new to go pizza place!"}
{"text":"Had a calzone and pizza from here for the first time today and it was amazing - I ate so much I was uncomfortable, but couldn't help it! The bread on the calzone was perfect and the texture of the pizza was spot on...it all just melts in your mouth.  Granted, it was delivered and I didn't pay for it, so I can't speak to the pricing or in-house experience, but it doesn't matter. I'd order from here again in a heartbeat!"}
