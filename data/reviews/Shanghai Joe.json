{"text":"This is mall food court Chinese food. Which usually fails to impress me.   SJ is the best food court Chinese I've ever had. It's on par with the quality of a regular takeout place.   I usually order Sesame chicken and Orange chicken along with fries rice and an egg roll. All of it delicious. The egg rolls are great.   My favorite is General Tso's chicken, but they only make it on Fridays. Which is probably my only complaint.   The lines move pretty quick and the prices are pretty good. About 5 bucks for an entree with the choice of 2 sides.   I really can't ask more from a food court restaurant. Easily my favorite place in Tower City."}

{"text":"I honestly think the idea of fast food from tower city on the rumble of the busses above you scares people into thinking its garbage food. People often automatically assume fast food is bad food. I recently started going to school downtown. I eat lunch at the food court every once and a while. When I first went to the food court I walked around deciding what I wanted. The food court has big chains like Sakio Japan, Mcdonalds, Subway, Nathans and a few others. It also has some less know places. Sakio is always busy but if you look how they store mass amounts of raw uncooked chicken under the grill it is disturbing. Shanghai Joe's scared me to and first. It was a local chinese fast food place. We all know the urban legends of where they get their meat. I went there for the first time and was surprised at a number of things in a good way. Number one they are fast. They rarely have a line and when they do it moves fast. Their food is good. I have had just about every chicken they have and it always tastes fresh and ready to go. Their pricing is a lot better than the other two chinese/japanese places in the food court."}
{"text":"I have been eating at Shanghai Joe for years.  I have never had a bad meal there. For $4.99, you get your choice of chicken (and there are several) and two side dishes.  The side dishes include potatoes, fried rice, noodles, or steamed cabbage and carrots. I usually opt for the cabbage, noodles, and BBQ chicken.  This is the best value you can get in downtown Cleveland, besides free food. There are at least three other restaurants serving similar food in Tower City, but this one is the cheapest.  You will not go home hungry because they pack as much food into the styrofoam container as they can.  It ends up being one to two pounds of food.  Recommend!"}
{"text":"This place is located inside Tower City Mall by the Subway, Taco Bell, and KFC.  The food wasn't the best tasting; however, you can't beat the price.  If you visit the place 20mins before closing (6:40pm), you can get a box dinner (2 entrees and 1 side) for $3.00 a box!  That's a really great deal compared to the $5.50 or $6.00 normal price.    Their mixed veggies were actually good, but the spicy chicken wasn't the best.  The chicken meat was subpar, and I wasn't quite sure what parts of the chicken I was eating.  The dish was super spicy that I had to subdue the heat by drinking some ice water.  The fried rice was bland with no flavor.  The portions are very generous and is definitely good for two meals."}
