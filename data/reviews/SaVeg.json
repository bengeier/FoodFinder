{"text":"With the whole \"New Year, New Me\" movement that occurs at the beginning of each year, an article along the lines of \"Must Try Plant Based Restaurants of Calgary\" recently came out.   SaVeg was featured and their Korean inspired cuisine is what piqued my interest. I find Asian vegetarian or vegan dishes to be more adventurous, flavourful but most importantly filling.   For lunch I went with the japchae glass noodles with pan fried dumplings. Mixed in the noodles were colorful veggies of spinach, carrots, peppers and onions, ribbons of tofu and sesame seeds sprinkled on top. The star of this dish were the dumplings. I ate one and immediately pried open a second one to see what was inside because I swear it tasted like pork!   With the delish food and reasonable pricing, I can't wait to head back to SaVeg again!"}
{"text":"I drop by SaVeg every once in a while.  This is probably my new favorite go-to in Calgary and while I appreciate its quiet ambiance, I would also love to see more customers inside.    SaVeg is a vegan cafe/restaurant that opened its doors in January.  Its owner, Rose Lee of the Youtube channel Cheap Lazy Vegan, is Korean so in addition to coffee, smoothies, tofu scramble, breakfast sandwiches, and baked goods, a few dishes are Korean or Korean-inspired.  These include the bibimbap, the japchae with dumplings, and the tofu and sweet potato with rice.  I am a Korean vegan so this place is like heaven for me (no pun intended, even though SaVeg is located within Heavens fitness).  But I would imagine that any omnivore with taste buds intact would love the food as well.  I once brought a blueberry muffin from SaVeg to work and a co-worker exclaimed, \"What are you eating?  That looks amazing!  It's just chock-full of berries!\"  (She was right.  It WAS amazing).  Some of the prices are great.  I once had the breakfast bagel sandwich ($5-6).  I wasn't expecting much, but it was generously laden with smoked tofu, tomato, veganaise, and avocado - and it tasted amazing, and was very filling.  The No-Fish filet is also around the same price range and was also delicious.  If you want to splurge more, the japchae (glass noodles) is around $11-12.  But I tried it, and can tell you that it is worth it.  Probably my favorite thing on the menu so far, and one of the best things I have eaten in Calgary.  I haven't tried the tofu scramble (yet) but $7 for the dish is a very good deal.  I would love to see the menu expand in the future, and to have it offer more Korean fare (kimchi, anyone?  Kimbap?).  But I understand that within a gym, they would want to start off by being more Westernized to draw in more customers.    I highly recommend this place.  Go check out SaVeg!  Give it more love!"}
{"text":"SaVeg is the brainchild of Calgary Local YouTuber Rose Lee, aka CheapLazyVegan. It is a local, family owned, Korean inspired Vegan cafe in the heart of the Beltline.   This cute little spot is inside the Heaven's building (some sort of Yoga studio?). It's a small, cozy space that offers 100% Vegan fare with Korean inspired flavours. Gazing in into the open kitchen you will be able to see Rose and her mother prepare your flavourful vegan meal.   I will admit that I am far from a Vegan, but luckily for me SaVeg's menu leaves room for plenty of bold colourful flavours despite there being no meat. They in addition to these korean inspired mains, they also offer standard breakfast fare, smoothies, and baked goods.   We headed over to check this place out after hearing it about it from Rose at an unrelated function, and I have to say I was pretty impressed despite my mixed experiences with vegetarian places in the past (refer to Veg-In-YYC). We had the Japchae (korean glass noodle) bowl with dumplings, and the house special, which is a tofu sweet potato mix with a sweet spicy korean sauce, served with rice and shredded cabbage. Pricing was reasonable, ringing in at $11.50 each.   The house special was for sure a standout. The flavour balance was done well and the \"sweet and spicy korean sauce\" was not prohibitively spicy for me, and I'm a lightweight when it comes to heat. The shredded cabbage was an okay compliment to the dish by adding much needed crunch, though I thought it could have been a little more interesting. Maybe there are other veggies they could experiment with to compliment the dish.   The glass noodles were pretty standard but good, though I figure the flavour could have been a little more bold with some more interesting contents in addition to the tofu and veggies. The dumplings were a nice compliment - a side of dipping sauce (rice vinegar, maybe?) would have complimented them well.   We also tried a piece of banana bread which was excellent, given that it was vegan. It was moist, sweet, and tasted exactly like regular banana bread.   Overall, I think SaVeg is a wonderful addition to Calgary's small vegan and vegetarian food scene - and with the prices reasonable, I wouldn't hesitate to visit again. As they grow I am looking forward to them hopefully expanding their food menu to include some more variety for me to sample."}
{"text":"I love their fish fillet sandwich, and love grabbing a latte as I'm on my way out to do errands. The staff are super pleasant, and all the prices seem very reasonable. So come in, order some food/coffee, chat with the staff members, and support your tummy local establishments!"}
{"text":"I don't like poke. There, I said it. I don't like poke. But the poke at saVeg (lower case \"s\" please) is stunningly good! Maybe it's because it's not mushy raw fish- I don't know, but the flavours they get out of pressed tofu and this tomato concoction that looks like red tuna (but tastes like tomato, which is lovely) are incredible.  saVeg is inside Heaven's Fitness and isn't the most comfortable seating, but it's worth the effort. It's 100% vegan."}
