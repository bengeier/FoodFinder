{"text":"The inside scoop:  I have worked on a couple food trucks in Charlotte, and I have been with Bleu Barn Bistro since it began. I am able to see the work and amount of effort put into this business (from the sourcing of their ingredients, menu creation, food presentation, customer service, etc.), and from the inside looking out, you're getting some of the best in Charlotte! Seriously.  The way this business operates excels way beyond many food trucks in Charlotte (trust me).  Both Tara and Brenton are EDUCATED chefs, and food is their life (not just their livelihood).  The food is a bit different than most people are used to, but venturing outside your comfort zone can be delicious! ;)   On to the best part! My favorites! THE Chicken Burger (any way) on the pretzel bun! Holy crap! O_O Wild Mushroom Grilled Cheese (with portobello and oyster mushrooms) Korean Chicken Tacos (with broccoli/bok choy slaw) Sides: (it's a tie) Roasted broccoli salad (broccoli, dried cherries, nuts) and loaded potato salad (4 local potato varieties, bacon, sour cream, and cheddar)  I can assure you that you're getting what you pay for. ;) A food truck that's serious about delicious food and sourcing locally... Yes!"}
{"text":"They were parked at Southpark Eats today and I had the BLT and the beet salad.  The BLT was awesome and worth every penny.  While the sides were kind of expensive, it was a large portion (more than I could eat).  I would be willing to have a smaller portion, for a reduced price.    Definitely restaurant quality food, made with fresh, seasonal veggies."}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped by last night and had the Autumn Squash Bisque, Pimento and Fried Green Tomato Grill Cheese and Genoa Salami Grill Cheese Sandwich, and oh my gosh was it all amazing.  The staff was friendly and welcoming.  Keep it up Bleu Barn Bistro."}
{"text":"amazing brisket sandwich- truly out of this world  it has melted smoked provolone, carmelized onions, horseradish mustard and some type of greens - possibly garlic saut√©ed spinach?   The beef was smoky and very tender.  My wife had the pork belly taco with pickled red onions - she thought it was the bomb.   The entire menu looks great.  I'm so glad they were at Triple C Thursday night   it really pays to track this one down!"}
{"text":"Yummy dinner! My sister and I love Triple C brewery.  Tonight we were delighted to have this great food truck for dinner tonight. I had a buffalo chicken burger and my sister had a bun less burger. We both agreed that the arugula (gourmet lettuce) on the burgers was plentiful and yummy. We split the fries where were thin and warm.    They support local farms and vendors which makes me very excited to support them! :)"}
{"text":"My family ordered the farmhouse burger, chicken tacos and pork belly tacos... all were amazing!!"}
{"text":"Ordered the burger and it is delicious! However, I asked for no onion and there was a heap of onions on the burger, that's the only reason I've given 4 stars instead of 5.  The service was super fast! I also replaced the chimichurri with the chipotle aioli, so so good!  I'll definitely eat here again, I'll just speak louder next time ;)"}
{"text":"I stopped by Mike's Beverages on Park Road yesterday to grab a six pack of beer and saw this cute food truck sitting next to it. I decided to get the burger and the goat cheese grilled cheese and both were absolutely fantastic. They were fresh, delicious, and great and unique flavors. I recommend this to anyone who stops by! Relatively good prices ($8 for each entree) and nice people! I give it 2 thumbs up!"}
{"text":"Was lucky enough to find this parked outside Triple C.  Had the slow cooked brisket, blew my mind, reminded me of one of my hometown comfort food staples in a really good way. German potato salad was also fabulous.  If you see bleu barn bistro parked somewhere go and eat there, and don't make the mistake I made of not going back for seconds later."}
{"text":"LOVE LOVE LOVE!! Have not (yet) had everything on their menu but I'm trying!!! Everything's delicious!! You just can't go wrong. It's the best comfort food that's been kicked up to a notch that makes you ask yourself how they did that. No joke. They aren't afraid of flavor! Seemingly simplistic food with a true \"WOW\" factor.  Hunt them down! You won't be disappointed. BTW...they actually do get this perfect crispness of the pork belly. So if you've tried pork belly before and wasn't blown away because it was to greasy and fatty, try this one. Amazing! Have the potato salad with it. It's loaded and so good you could make a sandwich out of it! No meat but so flavorful you'd swear there's tender chicken in it! NOPE! Just a variety of potatoes, cheese, and yum!  I can't wait to have more! Of everything! What to get this time...hmmm...so hard to choose!"}
{"text":"I would have given this food truck 5 stars, if the person working the order counter could have at least smiled or spoken politely after paying $8 for my grilled cheese sandwhich. The food was excellent, the cook was great; but I felt like I was really putting out the counter person."}
{"text":"First opportunity to try the Bleu Barn Bistro food truck.  The truck recently found a solid location across from GWV 800 and is walking distance from my office. It is a good location.  I ordered the chicken burger with a side of fried green tomatoes based on recommendations from teammate!  Both were absolutely delicious.  The chicken was made of ground chicken and served on a pretzel bun. The 4 fried green tomatoes were fried perfectly and served over a great sauce.  It is definitely a once per month lunch visit.  I would go more frequently...but will have to figure out how to budget the $15 lunch bill.  Overrall....very tasty...and look forward to trying the tacos with my next visit."}
{"text":"A year later and I still haven't printed our wedding photos, but I did want to take time to give Bleu Barn Bistro a killer review for catering our wedding. Tara was so great to work with from the first day that we communicated about what I initially thought was a crazy idea to have a food truck at a wedding. I love food trucks, so I really wanted to make it work and she helped me think through all the details! All of our guests were extremely happy with the appetizers that were placed out for all to enjoy and the dinner options that were served-up right out of the truck. It was so good that a year later people are still talking about the food! I'm only sad I don't live in Charlotte so I can go enjoy one of those pulled pork sandwiches or one of their awesome burgers! I would definitely hire BBB again for another event."}
{"text":"I love Bleu Barn Bistro. My favorite item is the pork belly tacos, but I have never had anything I didn't love. Always great service, quick, and yummy! Highly recommend to friends. Can't go wrong with a farm to table food truck!"}
{"text":"Wanted to try something different and new Bleu Barn happened to be parked outside Atheron Market for lunch on a Thursday. They describe themselves as farm to table, serving only seasonal ingredients that are sourced locally. Bright blue, adorable wagon posted up alongside the benches and outdoor tables... Perfect food truck lunch spot.  I fought the temptations of pork belly tacos, chicken and waffles, and grass fed farmhouse burger and went with the fire roasted veggie wrap.  There were only a few patrons waiting and no line. Food took a little longer than I anticipated, so I worry if it had been busier, but I'll give them the benefit of the doubt since they are still new.  Took it back to work with me and was surprised that it hadn't been cut and half and was essentially a burrito. Glad I was at my desk on a stable surface with knives. The wrap itself was large and pretty delicious. A little heavy on the lemon pesto but that's purely subjective.  Overall, the ingredients tasted fresh and I was pleased with my meal. Will definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"Amazing fresh local food. Bleu Barn came to my friend's wedding and I was amazed at their appetizers and loved the perfectly cooked shredded chicken. I ordered the jerk chicken tacos and they were delicious! I heard they have an actual location restaurant as well.. will update if I stumble upon it!"}
{"text":"I pack my lunch everyday and try to avoid eating out to save money. But it never fails, Tuesday morning my company sends out an email with the menu for the day and I see a new item I just can't pass up. Their food is so good and so fresh. They are so innovative with their ideas. I absolutely love them. I think this Tuesday I won't even bother packing a lunch."}
{"text":"Wowed by the menu, but not by the food.  This place is parked outside my office every other week and I was excited to try it after hearing some good things and seeing the menu. I opted for the patty melt and two of the chicken tacos.   The patty melt was just your standard patty melt and while it wasn't bad by any means, it just didn't quite hit the mark. They use locally sourced, grass fed beef and you will absolutely be able to taste the difference. Personally, I think grass fed beef is grossly overrated. I think it's better suited for stews, soups, chili, and other things where the meat doesn't take center stage. It was a bit chewy with a really big and bold beef flavor.   The chicken tacos were super basic. I needed more sauce or anything that would help it stand out. At $4.50/taco I expected something more. Needles to say, my $20 lunch consisting of a patty melt and two small tacos was a mild let down.   The crew was very friendly and the truck seemed to be well-maintained and clean. I will have to try out some additional things and see if it changes my mind, but not being able to nail some basic menu items, really isn't the best sign. Truly a 3/5 for me."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious. Had the pork belly tacos with a side of beet salad and they won me over for life."}
{"text":"Tied Bleu Barn Bistro up at Triple C brewery.  I ordered the chicken burger and it was amaze.  It had a really tasty mustard on it.  And all the ingredients are local and farm to table.  It was super fast; the staff was very friendly and I would definitely order it again.  The menu was very diverse and had vegetarian options as well.  Loved it!"}
{"text":"What an amazing and adorable truck!  I have had a few things from these wonderful people, including tacos and the chicken burger.  All delicious, and today the chicken salad brown bag with potato salad (they allowed me to sub) was equally as good.  Everything is fresh, and I appreciate the local food emphasis and TLC on every order.  Recipes are interesting, full of herbs and veggies.  The owner(s) is/are certainly not amateurs with flavor.  Creative, satisfying food that's a little more expensive - but WORTH it!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite food trucks that comes to visit my place of work. Bleu Barn Bistro never disappoints and I like that they aim to use locally farmed/sourced ingredients . If I could shake the hand of the cook/chef I would , but when I see them they are busy making unique meat, vegetarian, and vegan lunch options that are relatively healthy, seasoned with herbs and spices , and savory. The chicken burgers are bomb! I've had them in pretzel and brioche buns, and the meat itself is a great portion , I would guess at least a 1/4lb or more . They also serve traditional hamburger meat, but always with a unique twist."}
{"text":"Loved Blue Barn Bistro! We were at a Clover, SC fundraiser event. We laid eyes on this food truck and I went for the Sunny Side Hamburger. It was delicious- grass fed beef...my husband was very disappointed he did not order from BBB as well. Later I saw it in Charlotte where we live. I try to keep track of their location as they are very nice people and great food!"}
{"text":"This truck was sitting outside of Triple C when we arrived. That was a happy coincidence because we were hungry and had no idea what was around for food.  My wife ordered the burger and I ordered the pulled pork sandwich. We shared somewhat (translation: my wife shared with me, she doesn't do pork). The pulled pork sandwich was delicious and devoured quickly. The burger, although I only had a bite, was equally excellent and is something that I wouldn't hesitate to order at the next opportunity.  We split an order of the potato salad too. My wife loved it, but I didn't really care for it. Not that it was bad... maybe needed to be seasoned a little better. Plus it's probably just me but cold potatoes, when cut as huge as these were, are just kind of weird.  No matter. On the whole, it was great food."}
{"text":"First I have to say, I am so glad I am not a food truck owner. Why? The competition alone would just stress me out. I know that if you have a great product, people will buy it, but the food truck scene in Charlotte has exploded!!  Bleu Barn was parked outside of Three Spirits Saturday night. I had already eaten dinner times two, but as many know, food trucks are my kryptonite. Meal number three, here we come!! Chicken tacos, Caprese Style. Chicken with tomatoes, balsamic and shaved Asiago. Very juicy! I'm not a big corn tortilla fan but they were still delicious. Even better was the roasted beet salad (red and golden) with an Asian glaze. I've heard great things about their burgers, so I've already planned out what I'm eating next time I bump into these guys/gals."}
{"text":"Local, fresh, and delicious food! Need to check this great new food truck out!"}
{"text":"Had them for the very first time today....they were ok, nothing great. I had the Korean chix tacos; overall a good concept but they did not bring it all the way home for me. The chicken was a little overcooked and overpowered the cabbage/bok choy topping. The flavor of the topping was very mild and had it had a little more presence, the dish would have blended well."}
{"text":"Bleu Barn isn't just the best food truck in town, they are the best FOOD in town.  Possibly the best on planet earth.  Their Peruvian Pork Belly Tacos have actually brought me to tears.  It's the worlds most  perfect food."}
{"text":"This new food truck showed up at my favorite watering hole the other day so I decided to the check out the menu.   Plus #1:  Farm to Table!   Plus #2:  A vegetarian option!  Plus #3 - friendly staff.   I went with the veggie wrap.  This was not your typical veggie wrap typical sandwich veggies but it had a mix of roasted veggies:  muschrooms, eggplant, peppers, squash, and a light dressing with feta cheese.   The service on this was excellent. It was like they read my mind because I had just ordered it and walked away and then it was ready. Fast, I tell you.  And the taste was amazing.  Probably the best veggie wrap I've ever had.  I'm going to look for this truck more often!"}
{"text":"First timer for this food truck, the figgy bacon grilled cheese with Brie was amazing! Can't wait till next Friday!"}
{"text":"The best food truck I've had yet. The wild mushroom burger was probably the best burger I've had in Charlotte. The meat was flavorful and cooked perfectly, and the Havarti and mushrooms - so delicious! I sometimes find food trucks skimp on portion vs. price, but they do a great job on all fronts, I can't recommend enough :)"}
{"text":"We hosted a luau pool party September 9 at Stcrlciare Pool Club with about 125 guests to celebrate our recent wedding, which was in Hawaii. We had Bleu Barn Bistro cater the event, and they were FANTASTIC. Everyone raved about the food. There was something for everyone: the patty melt was my favorite, tacos were a crowd pleaser, potato and pasta salads were great. The crew was courteous and knew how to feed a crowd with a smile. We did a secret shop of all of the food trucks in Charlotte and chose Bleu Barn for our event based on the excellent food, friendly service, competitive prices, and their ability to cater large events without a \"fuss.\" People in my office now \"track\" bleu Barn and seek it out for lunch. Needless to say, would definitely highly recommend Bleu Barn Bistro and"}
{"text":"I usually LOVE Blue Barn Bistro, especially because they park outside of Triple C on their yoga/run club nights and it's the perfect hardy/healthy after-workout meal. However, they've just fallen a little flat for me recently.   I ordered the Chicken Burger, and while it was ready quickly and the ingredients were absolutely fresh, the meat was just overcooked and dry, which I understand is pretty easy to do for a chicken burger but... My friends around the table had the same experience (I wish I could remember what all they ordered so I could be more specific) - it was 100% \"it's okay\". Let me be clear, it was not bad in the least. I guess I was just expecting a bit more?   Maybe it was just the particular day.   Nevertheless I'll of course return. This experience has been my only gripe so far, I'm looking forward to updating this review with all positives :)"}
{"text":"I have had the pleasure of tasting Bleu Barn Bistro at some food truck rallys in the past, however, most recently I was able to give them another try at my apartment complex.  They arrived shortly after 5 and were set up and ready to take orders by 5:30.  They have a great menu, very extensive for a Food Truck.  Unfortunately, I think that causes some problems with execution, as I have never been extremely impressed with the food. On my most recent visit I ordered the Cuban Sandwich, at the recommendation of the staff.  Due to the amount of people I was told it would be about 20 minutes.   After 25 minutes I came back to the truck and my order ticket was still in the window, and the cooks seemed to be moving it around...not sure why? Needless to say it took well over 30 minutes. The Cuban was okay, the bread was only toasted right on top, basically a quick toast to show the marks, but didn't really melt the cheese and left the rest of the bread somewhat mushy.  The pork was also okay. Maybe I have caught them on off days, or not ordered the right meals, but with so many great food trucks out there not sure I would rush to their truck any time soon."}
{"text":"I love this place so much. I think my go-to fave has got to be their tacos, I eat them nearly every time I'm around the truck.   Protip: ask for the house hot sauce for your chicken tacos, one of the owners makes it from scratch and it really sets off the flavor."}
{"text":"THEE ABSOLUTE BEST!!  Quick and easy, SCRUMPTIOUS food - you can add an egg to sandwiches, and so many choices!! They even tell you which farms they source from :)  Best tip about this place: they have pretzel buns!!"}
{"text":"Food was awesome. Wait time was less than 5 minutes. Information on where your food is sourced. Can't beat the entire experience. Thank You!"}
