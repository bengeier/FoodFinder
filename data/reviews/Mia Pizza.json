{"text":"Don't order from this place. I gave this place way too many chances. From getting my order wrong, to not making it the way it should be, to over cooking the meat to where the wings where hard as rock. Just don't waste your money. They're are better places out there I'm sure of it"}
{"text":"I'd give it no star if I could after getting a flyer we decided to try them out 1st time was not good food was not that great. I decided to give them another try what a mistake the food was beyone terrible. It was dry, cold & tasteless we could not eat any of it. I pitched the food & menue and told everyone I know to never order from here."}
{"text":"To pizza lovers do not order from MIA Pizza on baum blvd. I order food and it came over an 1 hr. They have horrible customer services and the girl had the nerve to tell they made order was made it late, so it would be deliver late. Never again will I waste my money for food that is unsatisfying. How do u expect a customer to be happy with a pizza that's cold ass hell and sauce less ass hot wings? Piss me off."}
{"text":"Wow. This calzone was so horrible it was almost amazing. So much (generic) sauce. It wasn't even a veggie calzone it was like eating canned tomato/vegetable soup out of an utterly flavorless and soggy bread bowl. Super runny with virtually no cheese. I'm sure they're great people, delivery was on time but just, wow. Ugh. This is what I get for trying new pizza places. I don't usually say this but I actually would really like my money back."}
{"text":"After contemplating between two places to order wings, I went with Mia's. It was the worst mistake I could have made. I order their wings- they were over cooked, dry to the bone, and hardly a drop of sauce on them. DO NOT order their wings if you are looking for juicy, saucy wings. Terrible."}
{"text":"Don't do it! After traveling all day on delayed flights I was starving and happy to get a pizza delivered at late night. The delivery guy called me when he got here. Great, I thought, a heads up! ...but no way was he coming up to drop it off. He called a 2nd time to tell me to come down and get it. Why bother asking the room # when you order? I put my pjs on and the last thing I felt like doing after such a long day was go down to the lobby. I'm actually mad at myself for still Tipping him well. 
The pizza: Yucky pre made crust, jars of sauce... Didn't hold up to the \" homemade Italian food\" advertising."}
{"text":"ordered a large pizza and buffalo fries with cheese and bacon they delivered to the wrong house the people actually ate some of the food before they realized it wasnt theirs so they looked at reciept beat on my door and handed me my food !!!!!"}
{"text":"Ordered bbq wings, and baklava.  Delivery was quicker than expected.  Really enjoyed the baklava since it was the first time I had it with pistachios.   Instead of tossing the wings in bbq sauce,  the sauce was poured sparingly over the wings after they were put in the container, resulting in some wings having no sauce at all."}
{"text":"Don't waste your time ordering from here. For a small speciality pizza I paid 12 and received basically all dough. I looks like they forgot to put half the toppings on. Normally I wouldn't complain but if it weren't for the price I wouldn't have expected at least toppings on my pizza. 
Save your money and go elsewhere. Don't buy into the scam. We will not be ordering from this establishment ever again."}
{"text":"Let me begin by saying that it is not possible to give less than one star, or I would have.  The only stars I am seeing right now are the ones spinning around my head after taking one bite of my Chicken Alfredo that was sent to my house a few moments ago.  My wife and I have ordered from Mia Pizza many times in the past and use GrubHub for delivery services.  In the past, we have had good experiences with Mia Pizza, and it was \"our pizza place\".  Tonight I ordered the \"Chicken\" Alfredo and my life has changed forever.  What I received was noodles covered in \"Chicken\" and Alfredo sauce.  At first bite I thought the chicken was under cooked (strange texture and tart flavor), but I rinsed it off in the sink and this revealed the \"Chicken\" had a lovely gray tint to it, topped off with a strange oily sheen.  My wife took a small bite of the chicken and immediately wretched.  I called GrubHub and simply asked for a refund of the \"Chicken\" Alfredo, a whopping $11.59.  The guy from GrubHub told me he'd have to call the restaurant and ask for the money back.  After about 5 minutes he came back on the line and told me the \"manager\" of Mia Pizza had said he was \"very busy\" and that  I would personally have to RETURN THE \"CHICKEN\" ALFREDO myself for a refund.  He then hung up the phone.  I've gotta tell you, it is a great idea to tick off your customer base AND GrubHub as well.  Sounds like they've got a rocket surgeon playing \"manager\" at Mia Pizza.  On the positive side, I've been meaning to start working out again and I think the stomach cramps I will shortly experience will help with my AB definition.  Mia Pizza has lost a loyal customer and we will go out of our way to let everyone we know that MIA PIZZA is NOT the place to eat.  Steer clear at all costs....."}
{"text":"Just ordered a home delivery pizzas for a birthday party, instead of our original order of Vegetarian Pizza's we were sent the Non Vegetarian Pizza's , manger & delivery boy were too arrogant, low on etiquette and the manager went to the extent of threatening us to call cops just on our complaining and demanding them to exchange the entire order & just give us what we really did order.

This business is a sham. PLEASE AVOID if you don't want to ruin you precious moments of celebration.

Extremely extremely dissatisfied and annoyed that we chose this outlet."}
{"text":"This is THE BEST PIZZA I'VE EVER HAD! The sauce is amazing they must make it in house because I've never had anything like it. We ordered it two days in a row and I'm thinking of getting it again tomorrow! The hotwings are so mouth wateringly good you can't stop until they are GONE. It's affordable and they deliver, so if you're visiting Pittsburgh, this is where it's at. don't hesitate, stop everything you're doing and order it NOW! So impressed."}
{"text":"This was our first time ordering from here.  Our son will be a freshman at Pitt in the Fall and we wanted something that we could just order in to the hotel.   The front desk gave us several menus and we chose Mia's.  I was sorry to see so many bad reviews but I can safely say we were very happy with our choices.  We come from suburban Philadelphia where there is a pizza place on every corner and too many of them are those puffy crusted Greek pizzas which I can't stand.  Mia's was excellent.  Not too much crust for the pizza and well seasoned.  We also had burgers which were good and pasta which was really tasty.  We also got dessert  which was okay,  but the baklava was homemade and really good.  Prices were comparable to home and delivery was fast to the hotel. I highly recommend for visiting families or anyone else in town.  We will use again."}
{"text":"I ordered a spinach and feta pizza via grubhub.  The food was phenomenal and timely. The delivery driver was personable and very kind.  I would definitely recommend ordering from this establishment for their delicious food and fabulous service!"}
{"text":"After tonight's endeavor I am done with Mia Pizza.

When the order was placed it was specified that I wanted the meat tortellini in Alfredo sauce.  What I ended up getting was meat ravioli in Alfredo sauce (which cost more).  When I called back to Mia Pizza I was passed from one person to the next until the guy that took the initial order finally picked up the phone.  When I told him that my order was wrong he proceeded to argue with me.  At that point I got my friend who called the order in on the phone and shut him down.  

In order to get my right order I had to hand over my old order to them (which concerns me that they may have reserved that to someone else).  Finally, after two hours after placing my order, I had my food in front of me.  Might I say that it wasn't quite correct again.

The first time I could let it slide, but this is the second time this month that I ordered and got the completely wrong menu item.

After dealing with the wrong food and having to deal with an attitude, I am never coming back here again."}
{"text":"Pretty good. Not mind blowing but always satisfying. White pizza , standard cheese spinach feta, mozzarella sticks all good. Have ordered from this place many many times over the last couple of years and only had one dud (cold) pizza. Usually arrives fast and tastes fresh"}
{"text":"We were staying at the Marriott and didn't feel like driving for food. We ordered food to be delivered to our room after being recommended by the hotel. I wanted something that actually wasn't on the menu, an eggplant Parm grinder. Let me just say, they have a chicken Parm on the menu. When I ordered on the phone I SPECIFICALLY stated that I wanted something that wasn't on the menu, eggplant Parm. Oh, and also they DO offer an eggplant Parm dinner, so my request wasn't a huge stretch. The woman taking the order said no problem! After the food was delivered and the delivery guy took off I realized that I got a real funky sandwich. Eggplant with melted mozzarella, sliced mushrooms, red onions, and FETA! Wtf? I'm so tired of poor service and inadequacy. I tried to rip it apart and salvage the eggplant and mozzarella, but without any tomato sauce it was bland and dry. We travel to Pittsburgh quite a bit, but I'll learn to be more picky if Zarra's is closed in the future. Blah!"}
{"text":"Wow! This is so good. We liked it so much we ordered it 2 nights in a row. Good price for excellent pizza delivered to our door. From the marinara sauce to the habanero sauce, I highly recommend you try it. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Okay, so I want to start this review with a disclaimer.  Here it is:  The only items I have ever tried from Mia Pizza are (a) the buffalo chicken pizza, (b) the buffalo fries with mozzarella, (c) the chicken tenders, and (d) the hot wings.  They are all phenomenal.

The buffalo chicken pizza may be one of my favorite foods in the entire world.  I've had buffalo chicken pizzas from pretty much everywhere in the city (including Little Nippers, which is very good in its own right) but always end up coming back this place.  Somehow, Mia's recipe is just exquisite.  Their \"buff chick\" is spicy and saucy and usually cooked to golden brown perfection.  Not only does it have deliciously large chunks of chicken, but it also has crispy buffalo fries cooked under the cheese.  Healthy? No, absolutely not. Absolutely scrumptious? Definitely.  Worth a try if you haven't ever had it? Yes!

The other items are almost as good as the pizza.  The wings are spicy as hell and not soggy.  (Because soggy wings are gross.)  The tenders are crispy, but not dried out.  The buffalo fries with mozzarella have a little kick to them and are usually pretty crunchy.  (Note: The fries are really good with some Lawry's Season Salt sprinkled on top.)

Finally, we sometimes pick up in store and other times have it delivered via grubhub.  (This place isn't eat in.) Today, the guys at Mia have had our order ready exactly when they said they would for pick up.  In my experience, delivery is always pretty quick and the drivers are polite.  

If you like spicy pizza, you should for sure give Mia a try."}
{"text":"I absolutely love their meatball calzone and their spinach calzone, I try to combine them into one but they only get it right about half the time. I'm also addicted to the fried cheese sticks from this place. Sometimes the delivery guy can't find my work though. Overall it's pretty decent"}
{"text":"I don't know what the other posters are talking about. But I'd definitely rather get wings and pizza from here rather than papa johns, pizza hut or (shudder) voccellis pizza nearby. They're open late too!"}
{"text":"My food was delivered 1 hour late and it was cold. Cheese pizza was not good. I would not eat here again if I come back to Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"I've pretty much been exclusively ordering delivery pizza from this place for the last two and a half years. I like them because their pizza is pretty no-nonsense and it is cheap. Where else can you get an eight slice premium pie for under $18? My favorite is the Mia special pizza as it has plenty of meat and veggies. The dough isn't as crispy as I would like, but overall, the pizza is delicious. As for non-pizza fare, the house rolls with spinach and feta are amazing. I usually get that or wings with my order. The wings are ok--kind of expensive but the quality is standard, if not a little dry. I live right around the block from Mineo's / Aiello's / Napoli's, but I keep coming back to this place because it's affordable and I'm too lazy for pick up. I wouldn't recommend the hoagies, though. I had a couple and they weren't bursting with flavor & had too much bread going on."}
{"text":"I got the flyer for here. I was hesitant because the reviews on here weren't stellar. I'm very glad I tried it. Delivery was on time, price was right, and the pizza and spinach rolls were delicious. Will definitely order again."}
{"text":"I've been going here for a few years. The staff is really friendly, they'll throw in anything extra for an order (like napkins, plates, ranch, etc) and never charge you for it. The pizza has the optimal blend of sauce and cheese and is cheaper than all of the competitors in the area. The appetizers/snacks are all plentiful and again, cheaper than the competition. This is my go-to pizza place, and I'll keep coming back to it even though I live in the South Side."}
{"text":"I have ordered here in the past and the pizza is okay. But this evening was a little different. I ordered an Italian hoagie, because I didn't want pizza. I remember in the past I was not a fan of the hoagie, but I had received a message from the owner stating that things would change. I decided to give it another shot.

Let me tell you, nothing has changed. If anything it's worse than I remember. I requested mayonnaise exactly as before, and didn't get it. No pickles either. The hoagie was a hot sloppy mess. I'm not sure why it was hot, because nowhere on the menu does it warn you that it's toasted, and I certainly didn't request that. Gross. About four slices of meat, a mealy tomato slice and slimy warm lettuce. The lettuce and tomato must have been heated with the hoagie because they were so soggy they were mushed into the soggy bun. There were no onions or cheese to be found in this mess, although that is a detail the menu promises comes standard. 

I will not be ordering from this place again, and unless you're sticking to pizza and are drunk enough to forget even that mistake soon, I'd advise anyone to avoid it as well. There are so many great places to eat in this city, and Mia Pizza just doesn't keep up."}
{"text":"This is a restaurant owned by sweet Turkish people. I live 5 min away from this place by WALK...but I still order delivery... Haha... How lazy I am... Since I live so nearby, delivery makes super fast. AND they are such fast acting ppl... One time I ordered take out and it took only about 20 min to get my food ready... Impressing... well... at least to me. 
Quality wise- I don't know much about Turkish cooking but their pizza... woo I just couldn't take it... too greasy and too much cheese for me (if you are into those types of pizza go for it.... their cheese blend tasted good)... But that's about the only thing that I don't like at this restaurant. I almost always order bbq wings that are cooked just right with just enough sauce (Not too much nor too less). French fries-crispy and not too greasy like those of some other pizza places have. Pasta- good, it comes with melted cheese on top I almost thought that I mistakenly ordered a pizza.Pasta sauce wise... restaurants claim that they're homemade but I never believe it... there were lots of onions in Mia's pasta sauce... So I'm thinking they are at least adding chopped onion to their pasta sauce (maybe they're buying sauce with lots of onion in it but I haven't seen such thing). 
Overall, I'm pretty happy with their food and will keep order from them."}
{"text":"This pizza shop has pretty good food especially their wings with the hot sauce but their prices just went up and the girl who took my order tried to charge me an extra 75 cents for extra sauce which was never charged before. I am done with this shop and they lost a customer because of their greed. I spent my money at PESARO which has GREAT FOOD AND BETTER PRICES!"}
{"text":"Well I just ordered a steak hoagie for delivery. No lettuce or tomato on it ;( ruined it for me"}
{"text":"PLEASE don't eat there, it the worst. I pulled up to the restaurant,  a young girl sitting outside smoking a cigarette. She jumped up and waiting on me and took my money, never washed her hands. She went back there and start rolling the dough for my pizza. The other girl that was helping her in the back, was drinking a soft drink while cooking the food. Then she start messing with her hair. This other guy that was outside eating came in the restaurant and went into the kitchen and start helping out without washing his hands. I wasted $26 dollars, I threw this sit in the garbage. Don't eat there, they don't wash there hands."}
{"text":"There were quite a few negative reviews for this place, so I wanted to make sure I shared my positive experience. I ordered delivery through yelp. Delivery was estimated to take 45 minutes to an hour. The pizzas were delivered almost exactly an hour after we placed the order. Food was hot, sodas were cold. The pizza was not life changing, but I didn't expect it to be. It was tasty though. My husband ordered a small Mediterranean pizza. I ordered a small half cheese, half veggie. Pizzas were a little bigger than expected, so we have leftovers. Leftovers are always a plus. Nice meal for a lazy Sunday night."}
{"text":"Pizza is average. It's not terrible and it's not delicious. Average isn't always bad because the red sauce does have a nice taste. I'm just not a fan of the scorched cheese pizza that seems to be so popular amongst the college crowd. Know what I mean? There have been shops putting out these types of pizzas for years. It's weird because people either love it or hate it this way. I'm just \"meh\"."}
{"text":"The pizza is cheap and bland.  I am pretty sure they use pre-made crust despite their advertising of dough made fresh daily.  Maybe it is made fresh daily at some factory, then frozen, then sent to Mia Pizza?  Their wings came with hot sauce drizzled on one side of the wings.  It was weird to eat a fried piece of chicken, then get some hot sauce, then a piece of fried chicken.  Also, they said they came with blue cheese.  They did not...they came with the same watered down ranch that came with the bland pizza.  I honestly wonder why I order from these places that pop up on Grubhub...90% of them are horrendous."}
