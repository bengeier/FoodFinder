{"text":"We walked in trying something new and never heard anything about this place from anyone, but it was close to the house and we didn't want to drive. Anyways... we walked in and it was so dark and dingy, it was very quiet and it was the type of place where you can tell there were regulars, but not a whole lot.  We were about to turn around and walk out, just due to the ambiance, but decided to sit for at least one drink.  We were very surprised after... The service was AWESOME! So we decided to order some appetizers. The food was unforgettable. We were so impressed by it all. So now it's one of our spots.  Just wish they would redecorate,  they would attract more people if they did... every time we go, it's always pretty empty.  Too bad, cus they have something going there."}
{"text":"Food great service sucks! From bartenders to servers I even called and talked to management about horrible service came back tonight after months and it was worse then I remember Barbie was the server horrible 0 stars"}
{"text":"Gary the manager is awesome! Made us feel very welcomed! My husband is about to do karaoke! Scary"}
{"text":"Rude and disrespectful staff. Bartender actually put a straw in my bottle drink and took a sip of my drink and his fingers all over the mouth of the bottle. Gross!!! Bar is dark and gloomy. Avoid at all costs."}
{"text":"Great food...good tap selection...friendly servers and clientele. :-) cool vibe....check it out."}
{"text":"Not knowing they were awarded the 2010 Best Burger in Vegas (by a local newspaper), we were attracted by the exterior decor.  The inside was colorful (giant platapus...huge cowboy riding a crawfish...).  But the reason I really liked this place was the burger.  Note picture.  I considered dislocating my jaw to get that monster in my mouth. Great service, very good burger (fried egg, bacon, cheese, burger, good veg accompaniment).  Check it out."}
{"text":"Went in last night with my husband and met two wonderful ladies who were giving great customer service from start to finish! They were the bartenders and very friendly and welcoming. The food was awesome and the prices were right. It even brought in good company to sit with from the neighborhood. Those two ladies, I didnt catch their names but they were so amazing. More bars need bartenders who actually care about their customers like these ladies!!! I reccomend you give them a stop by on your next friday night :)"}
{"text":"Best place in town Susan is the best bartender ever. Great food. Tanner is the best server ever. If you want friendly service come to this place!!!"}
{"text":"Quite little watering hole that's been here forever. Not overpowering with cigarette smoke and the waitstaff is always fast and friendly. The food is fresh and easy for a night out with the girls or grab it quick with a beer. It's comfort American food at its best. No fuss just the way I like it, thanks guys."}
{"text":"My mother and I googled good burgers in Las Vegas and they popped up for their Fat Charlie Burger. So we checked it out and it's a dark bar setting, smelled of cigarettes as soon as you open the door. We ordered TOGO since that was not a setting we'd sit in for lunch. The burgers were good but the next day I checked my account only to find the waitress took the liberty of adding her own tip! (I didn't leave one because it was just TOGO and no services were provided to myself or my mother, no drink etc.) So I called the manager and his excuse was my bank did that not the server! Poor poor poor service. Will never go back."}
{"text":"My fiancé and I just moved to the area and decided to check this place out last week. We've been back one time since then and both times we were greeted with friendly attitudes and cold drinks. Nikki is an awesome bartender that remembers orders 4 and 5 deep. I think we've found our neighborhood watering hole! The only con is the food, which is ordinary bar food. The food isn't bad, it's just kind of bland and uninspired, but hey they've got decently priced drinks and a good vibe so it doesn't matter."}
{"text":"Sheila & Stan are the best bartenders. Always get the San Fran burger which I think is the best in town. The manager Gary always takes time to say Hi. Servers Barbi & Theresa are always efficient & cheerful. Great neighborly place to drink/eat!"}
{"text":"I did have nachos were good, I did find out the bartender's name ( Joe ) after 45 minutes, they did have a raffle I told Joe i did not have a ticket never he didn't care ,I just recently move to this area I will visit this place again, very nice place to watch the game, good specials."}
{"text":"Normally, I would give this place at least 4 stars, as they're food is pretty damn delightful. However, I had to give it three for the lapse in customer service as of late.  I've been going to this place almost every month since I was 19 years old. Yes, 19. Recently I went in with four people, one of whom was under the age of 21, which had been no big deal the last 6 years I'd been going. Apparently, this isn't OK anymore and we were asked to leave. Normally I wouldn't be bitter, but it was done pretty  rudely.   Other than the stank waitress, the food is pretty good and the prices are decent. Just watch out for falling dust from the eccentric Aussie decor."}
{"text":"The late night specials is where it's at! Food is decent and cheap. The atmosphere is chill and the drinks are stiff late night. Very conveniently located. The building looks bigger on the outside"}
{"text":"I've been going to Charlie's for years, but never had the fortitude to try the \"Fatburger.\" Their burgers are very good, not what one gets at The Palm, but very good nonetheless. In fact, I've never had anything there I've not enjoyed.  I could go on and make this \"review\" quite long, but this is just another Las Vegas pub, albeit one with good food and that's \"reliable\" in terms of food. But, it's just a pub. That said, I think Vegas has the most consistently good pub food that I've ever experienced. Now I live near the Outside Inn -- and feel the same way about it. Good food and no mistakes with regard to ordering anyting."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I love to come here. We wanted to try some new places to hang out for date night and we stopped here, and come almost every week.  It's just a regular bar but you feel like family. We both love the wings, and the potato skins are PERFECT. Nice beer specials, and always a game of some sort on."}
{"text":"We went here for the first time today. The food is just mediocre bar food. We put (& lost) $45 in the gaming, and still paid for our drinks.  Service was decent, but I see no reason to return."}
{"text":"a four star diner in the best way possible. Just the kind of place you can you can eat a totally ok sandwich (the burgers are actually pretty kick ass) and be around way better than ok people"}
{"text":"I like this place! I've lived down the road from it for years and would usually only visit for breakfast, but last night I decided to visit for a couple beers. Personally, the decorations are fantastic. I mean, what could be more aesthetically appealing than a cowboy riding a shrimp? I don't know! The waiter and bartenders were really sweet,  food quality and prices were also good!  Overall, great place to hang out in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"I have been coming to this bar for about 3 years now. I personally love their patty melts, and my husband loves their hot wings. Karaoke on Mondays seems to draw in a bigger crowd, but other than that it's a fairly quiet bar with excellent food, and great prices. I've never gone there for drinks so I'm only commenting on the food. I've always had great service. One server even knows me by name when I call in my order without even saying it, just from always ordering the same thing on her shift."}
{"text":"Did more searching for Best Burgers in Vegas and found this place to be on LVRJ's (\"Las Vegas Review Journal\") 1st of 10 burgers mentioned in their article \"Meet The Top 10 Burgers In Las Vegas\" back in 2009. Since I've been on a Burger Binge, I had to try this place!  Fat Charlie's Burger and Fries: comes with a fried egg, bacon and cheese. Server even asked me how I wanted my egg.. I got it over easy (over medium may have been a good choice as well). Yes, egg with burger has been done before, \"Fat Burger\" was the first rendition I've ever had a burger with egg. But this place does it BIG!! Quality of the patty was good overall, juicy enough and lightly seasoned. Buns were proportioned well with the steriod pumped patty. May want to jog around the block before and after a Beast like this! Fries were the fat potatoey delicioius ones! Went hand in hand with the burger.   Interesting enough, everything else in this place was Super sized! They had a Huge wrap around bar filled with character - bikini tops/bottoms hung from the metal bar roof, super high warehouse type ceilings (you could stick a freakin' palm tree in there!), Jumbo sized decorations hung from the ceiling - A Huge Marlin or Swordfish, Cowboy Riding a Shrimp.. Weird but Fun!    Sweet service, Great burger for a Great price, Unusual and Interesting Decor! It was like eating outside a ranch but inside a building.. Dive Bar Gone Wild??!!"}
{"text":"Great neighborhood bar. Great service, good food, and more then fair prices. $2.50 light beers, $4 Stella's. No happy hour. Prices are the same 24/7/365. Great ambiance. No better place to watch a game and relax."}
{"text":"Great Friendly Service. $4 for some tasty house Cabernet. Just ordered Tacos. They are great! They tuned the NBA game on for me. Great place. you have got to go."}
{"text":"Great food, great prices, great service!  They have good comfort food, honestly great quality. I got San Francisco Chicken sandwich with fries and how salad, my fiancé got the Fat Burger double, slathered with ghost pepper sauce with onion rings, and our friend got Steak and Butterfry Shrimp with mashed potatoes. Some Alaskan Amber on tap, and Sierra Nevada joined our meal. The chicken on my sandwich was moist, and juicy. The bread was a beautiful golden crisp. The french fries were amazing. The salad was fresh.  My fiancé enjoyed his Fat Burger, the ghost pepper sauce had a bite, that's for sure. The onions rings were hands down the best I've had!!!  The Steak and Shrimp looked great. The mashed potatoes looked like the classic set up, topped with beef gravy.  The waitress was really sweet.  The ONLY let down is that they allow indoor smoking, so be aware of it if someone has breathing problems. I got used to it even with my light asthma, and nothing stuck to my clothes or hair."}
{"text":"Great food and superb service. From the moment we sat down. Even satisfied my vegan niece . Thanks again"}
{"text":"Decent place. It was kind of quiet on Tuesday night graveyard, so I guess technically Wednesday....they have a good beer selection at fair prices.  Kitchen is open 24 hours. I did not order anything this visit besides beer. However the bar food was solid with many choices. The bartender said Monday is Karroke night when the Charlies comes alive. Let me know when you want to meet for a beer."}
{"text":"I love this place for breakfast.  Great for a nice hangover breakfast without screaming, rambunctious kids.  No one under 21 is allowed in.  My usual waitress (totally blanking on her name atm) is super friendly and provides excellent service.  I love being able to get mimosas with my breakfast - which never fails to disappoint.  Nothing fancy or special, just delicious chicken fried steak, eggs bennie, French toast and everything else I\"ve had there."}
{"text":"I used to walk over for a cold beer and great service than me and the wife stopped in for lunch.  My burger was awesome!  My wife had half a sandwich of some sort and some wedding soup!  I traded her a few onion rings from my western burger and had me some of that soup.  Fantastic does not touch it.  Mind blowing comes close.  Very good food however the service was a bit slow.  We will definitely stop in again for a lunch bite and you should try it as well.  Might see you there!  Hope you enjoy and hope this review helps you  out."}
{"text":"This place is hands down a gem! They have happy hour specials 24/7, 365 days a year! It's never too crowded and their food is also delicious, I recommend their clam chowder...you will not be disappointed! Good food and drinks for a great price is what you'll get."}
{"text":"Went with 2 friends at 630 on a Friday night and sat in a booth. A nice young man sat us down, brought us some drinks, and continued to check on us. After almost 20 minutes, there was two ladies at the computer and one loudly said \"fine I guess I'll take this one\" and came over and said \"are you ready to order?\"  She made it extremely obvious she did not want to deal with us!  I think her name was Barbie (she never introduced herself but that name was on the bill), and she looked like she was strung out on something. We didn't see her again until our food came, but the young man continued to check on us.   The food was not good.  I got a Cajun chicken salad, which I didn't even eat except for the chicken. It tasted like a plain crappy salad drowned in ranch. My friends got breakfast, which was mediocre at best.  The young man flagged down our server, who dropped off our check and never came back to our table. We waited over 30 mins to have someone take our payment. We could tell the young man was getting frustrated because he was not able to process payment himself and the lady didn't care that he kept telling her to run our credit cards. Eventually we gave up, put the exact dollar amount in for each check, and tipped the young man who took care of us all night.  By far one of the worst experiences I've ever had eating out.  The lady servers both appeared to be strung out on some sort of drugs and were embarassingly terrible at their jobs.  I worked in food service for ten years serving, bartending, and managing, and I do not understand how these women have jobs, or how this place is even still open if this is how it's being run. The one star I gave it was for that young man who was hosting/bussing/doing everything!"}
{"text":"Best Bloody Mary in the state! The biscuits and gravy so good and the fresh dip was excellent!  Stan is the man!!!"}
{"text":"Good food, very friendly, very close to the house.  Enjoyed the atmosphere and conversation :)"}
{"text":"Good place chill vibes, a little old school place at the corner of lake Mead and bucgalo, makes a good place to meet up."}
{"text":"Amazing food for such a reasonable price. Staff is super friendly and there's so many cool things hanging in this place!!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for breakfast at 10am on a Sunday. A few tables were occupied and a couple people at the bar. We waited a bit for menus, no big deal. We placed our order for an omelet and a breakfast burrito. 45 minutes later still no food and no return of the waitress or bartender. Finally after an hour of waiting we left $6 for the one beer we ordered and walked out. While leaving we overheard another table complaining they had waited a half an hour for mimosa and still had not placed their food order. Avoid at all cost. Total waste of time."}
{"text":"We have been coming here for breakfast for over a year. The food is great but even more importantly the service and the people are amazing. They make you feel welcomed as soon as you walk in the door. There is never a moment you have to look for Teresa to ask for anything because she is on top of it. Great place great food great service... highly recommend!!!"}
{"text":"I loved this place - we used to live around the corner from it and would walk there and stumble back home from a night of drinking...  One night I decided to eat there, I figured, \"Why not? I'm here and if I get sick, Walgreen's is next door and I can walk there to get something to settle my stomach...or buy a pack of smokes!\"  After eating there, it became a place where hubby and I could meet friends at any time of the night since their kitchen is 24 hours. It's a fun place for greasy food...and I fell in love with their Philly Cheesesteaks. I don't know what it was, but I never had a bad philly cheesesteak there -- ever. Best of all, we could have beer with our pancakes at 3am if we wanted. Not many can boast about that...wait, maybe that's not something to be proud of.  At any rate, their breakfasts are great, too. Hubby and I could split a stuffed french toast breakfast, but more often than not we didn't because he didn't want to share. HAH!  The last time I was there with my cousin, I was a bit shocked at how different it was.  The clientele seemed a bit older and a lot more cranky.  Maybe we just got there at the wrong time, but it wasn't the Charlie's Down Under I remember getting ripped at and then stumbling back home at 4am.  Overall, I still love this place."}
{"text":"Service is a little slow, but seems like they are short staffed. Booths surround the bar and are not really in a dedicated area. Booths are also extremely soft and not that supportive. Food was good and came out at a standard pace."}
{"text":"Perfect place to have a burger, drink and a little gaming. Great staff wonderful food! Had the California chicken sammy...so good!! Hubby had a burger double patty...awesome!  I think we found our new local pub."}
{"text":"I've been in this place a handful of times, and I guess I never reviewed them.  I was going to go in again tonight for late night happy hour so I could refresh myself, so I called in to make sure that still exists.  The girl that answered the phone told me there is no happy hour, late night or regular, and there never was.  REALLY?  I swore I went there with friends and ate $1 sliders.  Maybe the food is just always cheap?  I dunno, not sure if I want to go back to a bar that doesn't do a happy hour."}
{"text":"Great, fun place for diner food! My vodka tonic is well mixed. Darin got a Fosters and a chilled glass. Our order was chicken fried steak for him and surf & turf for me. Super friendly wait staff! We both chose the salad rather than the soup to go with our entrees. They use romaine lettuce rather than iceberg so major plus on that! The entrees came out right as we finished our salads, well cooked, not over seasoned like your find many times at places like this. All in all a solid choice!"}
{"text":"Same bartenders and servers for such a long time now! And that is so freakin refreshing! Not to mention the food.. The Philly is awesome the sausage with breakfast is killer and let me tell you about the best burger in town!!!! No, I'm not kidding!! I have been to so many places including Charlie's other locations however, hands down every time consistently this place has the juiciest, tastiest, biggest, absolutely amazing burger!!! And it's priced amazingly A++   And on a side note, to the staff: All of you have been amazing, so many times I've been there and every time has been the best  Thank you sooo much I shall return soon! lol   Cali Berger** what's up!! lol"}
{"text":"My sister and I not really sure where we wanted to eat decided to come here.  Truly don't know why.  Maybe to just try a local spot.  It truly was not what I expected.  I was expecting a place with smoke everywhere, and the service to be poor for non regulars, but it was the opposite.  It couldn't be further from the truth.  The place was clean and smoke wasn't perfuming the air.  Our waitress was great and very sweet.  The food was also better than I thought it was gonna be.  It didn't get the Fat Charlie which has received acclaim from the LV journal, but I had a regular cheeseburger and it was well above average.  I really can't wait to go back and try the Fat Charlie.  This place was a delightful surprise for me.  It's definitely not what some people expect it would be.  Considering that it is A neighborhood saloon."}
{"text":"I was looking for a good neighborhood bar.  What I found was a great neighborhood bar!  Cold beer, good food, and great service makes this watering hole the place to meet up with friends to chill, grab a bite, or catch a game (or all of the above).  They have individual speakers so you always get the sound for your team, which is great if your team isn't the popular vote in the room.  If you, like me, are looking for a great place to pull up a stool.  You can't go wrong with Charlie's.  - Patrick  P.S.  Two words: Loaded Tots. :-)"}
{"text":"Great value. Waitress is great. They say the have Dr. Pepper but it is a knock off. They do let people smoke at bar so if you hate smoke pass."}
{"text":"This is an extremely smoky bar with terrible music. The atmosphere is not there, the music is so low that no one really talks. The food is just ok and the service is very mediocre. The crowd is in their 50's so their is not much action as most people are gambling. This bar needs a major facelift! I would probably not recommend it to anyone as there are better places to experience"}
{"text":"The place is very dark, but inviting. The waitress was very nice and was attentive. The reason for the four stars is that the food was okay. I got a burger and fries. Not many fries and the burger was dry, but still okay."}
{"text":"I can't tell you how the food was because we went almost 10 mins ( or the duration of 2 songs) without someone checking if we even wanted something to drink.  The people next to us looked like they didn't have anything on their table either and they were there before us."}
{"text":"Charlie's down under is a 24 hr bar that serves breakfast all day. When you need breakfast at 5:30 in North LV, this is a great choice. The coffee was hot and strong, the portions were large and very tasty. The staff was attentive and friendly. I can highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Cool ambiance! Don't order the nachos - the menu says the nachos come with guacamole - it doesn't  It was slopped on the chips. I definitely ordered the wrong item. I was never asked if it was ok. Only given a bill... Hummmm who does this? As far as a cool place to go it's really cool. Decorations are awesome. So, if you want to go to this place, remember no nachos. The staff seemed really friendly. 80s music playing while I was there today. Not sure if it's always like this."}
{"text":"Meh....  I came out for karaoke last night, and will probably not return unless its a special occasion.   I don't really understand the decor...there's a cowboy riding a giant prawn hanging from the ceiling, and a giant platypus over the bar...its a little weird.    Drinks are expensive, and their \"specials\" are on really crappy beer.    Karaoke was fun, but apparently the owner or manager of the bar doesn't like the music loud...I will never understand bars that want karaoke, but don't allow the host to play the music loud enough for the singers to hear.   It got a bit better as the bar filled up, the volume was turned up, but...I want to sing like a rockstar, and that requires loud music.  You can't half ass Pat Benatar.   It was ok, but there are definitely cheaper places to drink with better regulations for sound."}
{"text":"Good little neighborhood bar. Not as good as service as others like Sierra gold, but a more blue collar atmosphere. In my opinion Charlie's has better food on average than most places with similar vibes."}
{"text":"Great bar and great prices! I got the Cobb salad (without meat) and the fried mushrooms which are very good! As a vegetarian I could find options which is unusual at a bar most of the time. The happy hour specials are also a plus! Definitely worth checking out."}
{"text":"The bloody Mary's here are some of the best I've ever had, spicy of course. Wether you're here late at night or early a.m....like right now. I always go for the potato skins with their salsa and wings are pretty good too. Service is always timely. This is a go-to."}
{"text":"Not exactly a young persons hangout...but the menu is big, the food is great, and the prices are pretty cheap!!!"}
{"text":"1st time I went here I lost $500 playing video poker at the bar.  Bartender very nice.  Comped my food and drink.  Next time in I lost $200 and they comped my beer, made me pay for the food but again bartender very nice.  Last time in I won $100, paid for my food and was totally ignored by the bartender.  She actually seemed like she was angry that I won and that it was an inconvenience to make change so I could tip the food waitress.  Too many other options out there to be treated like this."}
{"text":"Really stellar burger, fun atmosphere.  Much better food than the other similar 24 hour joints (PT's, Timbers, etc.)."}
{"text":"We saw this place by chance on our way to Osaka and decided to give it a try. The first thing you notice is a very particular decoration! So pretty! Great neighborhood atmosphere and it looks like there are a lot of locals which is a good thing. The drinks are very cheap so you can actually stay longer with your friends. I was (successfully) gambling long enough and our server comped my drink. The staff is very friendly and the food is good. A burger and fries were way under 10 bucks. How can you complain. Great time. We will definitely come back for more."}
