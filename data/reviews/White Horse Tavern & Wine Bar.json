{"text":"We held my mother in law's 80th birthday here.  Service was excellent and the staff was very attentive.  Food was also good.  We received nothing but compliments from our guests.  We will definitely consider them again for future family events."}
{"text":"It is my 8th year anniversary to my wife.  Just moved to area about a year ago.  We love history and thought this would be a nice place to visit.  I used open table for a reservation.  What open table did not tell us was that the main dining area was closed.  I get a call from the manager telling me this and that he can set up a private room for us.  We get there and Mike the manager and Jeanine our waitress had set up a small private room for us!  It was fantastic!  To the food, Jeanine was super knowledgeable about the menu and made excellent suggestions.   Thank you very much for a great experience and dinner!  By the way I wished Mike a happy birthday today for his service in the Marines.  Now Happy Veterans Day tomorrow Mike!  He wasn't taking either day off of work because they are busy and he a wants to support his team!"}
{"text":"Wow. We saw an article in the daily local and recognized the chef's name from the Riverstone cafe. When we heard he was there and they completely renovated the restaurant, we had to check it out. The food was spectacular, as expected. We had the special soup, coconut carrot and ginger, amazing. For our entrees we went with what was recommended by the manager,Bill...braised short ribs and the pork loin special...to die for. This place is fit for any occasion, night out, anniversary, you name it. The wine selection was ridiculous! They carry roughly 70 different bottles that range from all price points. Overall, food and service were superb, if you're a foodie you should try having chef Wassel cook you a 6 course tasting menu...he knows what he's doing! Keep up the great work guys, we will definitely be spreading the word around for you!"}
{"text":"Was at the Whitehorse Tavern in the bar area. The bartender is very polite. The decor has been updated and is very nice. They have a good selection of wine and whiskey."}
{"text":"My husband and I came here for the first time on a Friday night.  I tried to call and make reservations but the call kept going straight to voicemail and I never received a call back.  It turns out a reservation was definitely NOT needed, as the place was dead the entire time we were there. It was just us and one other table - a small group that I think actually knew the people working at the hotel/restaurant.   Despite the small turn out, the food was very good. I enjoyed the Arancinis, Caprese salad, and Brussell sprouts while my husband had the beet salad and shrimp cocktail.  Considering we got there during happy hour, a glass of wine was only $5 and the small plates were 1/2 off!  Great deal.  I do wish they had fewer tv in the bar area.  And I really didn't understand why they had QVC on one of the TVs.   The hours listed on Yelp are not correct.  They are open for breakfast, lunch and dinner."}
{"text":"Ordered room service for the burger and fries, and I would have been better off going to Wendy's. The bun was soggy and the fries were rock hard. I also ordered vodka and cranberry from the bar... I was basically drinking cranberry juice."}
{"text":"Well we go here every Christmas Day. This year no one called us back after 3 messages were left. I finally heard from someone but we made other plans. I told him we would be interested in New Years Day. He said they would be open. So we made the reservations and when we got there the restaurant was closed.  Thankfully we could eat in the bar area. We had the regular menu to chose from. My meal was over cooked. Only thing I could get was the chicken and it was not edible. Everyone else had pretty good selections. Our waitress was very attentive as we were the only ones there. It would have been nice to have a call that they would have the regular restaurant area closed. Not real sure we will be back."}
{"text":"This is a bar / restaurant in the Sheraton in Frazer, PA.  Food is above average and better than most local options.  Beer and drink selection are excellent.  The best part is the service from Rocco - he genuinely makes you feel welcome.  I stay in the area regularly and always happen to drop in - it's always been a great experience."}
{"text":"I stopped in the other night with a few of my friends for dinner expecting just another wine bar with overpriced, over salted ol' standbys (oh yay, another \" artisanal\" bacon cheeseburger for $15) but I was pleasantly surprised. The atmosphere of the dinning room is perfect: high ceilings, wooden floors, and a giant stone fireplace fitting this historical landmark. We were seated promptly by a short and very friendly waitress. Immediately I was nervous because we were the only people there except a few 30-something single men drinking wine at the bar - that never bodes well. However, there was a great wine list and new menu this week so we ordered a little bit of everything and hoped for the best.  I got the muscles starter, the blockhopper sandwich ( I think this is what it's called), and the Philly pretzel bread pudding and my dinning mates got the buffalo salmon and the ribs - all off the new menu.     My sandwich....swoon. The chicken was perfectly fried without being too oily and even though I had my doubts about the peppers, cream cheese, and marmalade combo, as soon as I bit into it, I realized the chef was doing a play on a jalapeno popper - a very smart play. I tried my friend's ribs and they were outstanding. I have had many a good rib, mind you, but these were interesting : cinnamon and just the right amount of heat - again it was a creative and skilled play on comfort food we all know and love.      We polished off bottle number two and destroyed our dessert of chocolate- peanut butter goodness. My one suggestion would be to put more course salt on the bread pudding itself just because my mouth was expecting the sharp crunch with a Philly pretzel base. I do, however, applaud the chef's use of a good high-quality chocolate. It seems like whoever is back there is doing a great job being inventive by playing on the classics without being gimmicky. I am happy I found this place before too many people give it a try and I'll have to wait for a table. I 'll most definitely be back for more, even if it means weathering the mind numbing traffic on rt76."}
{"text":"Stayed overnight went for breakfast...had a buffet or menu breakfast...we choose menu because the food at the buffet appeared old and cold..our coffee was like warm...twice...second pot also...my toast came dry 5 minutes before my eggs...potatoes were cold and dried up...(from the buffet??)What an awful breakfast...on the bright side our room was great and the hotel staff was very accommodating."}
{"text":"Ordered the buffalo wings, it was poor. Beer on tap was good. All should know. Service by Rocco was good too. Get a cheif!!!"}
{"text":"We were looking for a place to meet friends halfway and my husband remembered how we often ate here in years past.  (to tell you the truth I have no recollection of this). And I'll soon forget it again.  According to the website they are open for breakfast, lunch and dinner.  Well they certainly don't seem to know this.  We stopped in for lunch and sat down in the back of the bar area.  WRONG!  If you want service sit at the bar or go somewhere else.  There were 2 people working - or should I say one person working at the bar, as the cashier and as a waitress.  I'm not really sure what the other person's responsibilities were except that she did very little.  I could go on .............and on.....but I'm too frustrated. Not going back. Ever."}
{"text":"A colleague and I attended the Grand Opening of this new restaurant attached to the Sheraton in Great Valley.  They had just completed renovation to the new bar, and it was worth every penny! The decor throughout is elegant and comfortable, and the menu is phenomenal!  We thoroughly enjoyed oysters on the half shell with a red wine mignonette, smoked salmon pastrami crudites (amazing!), cider braised pork belly, and braised short ribs! My compliments to the chef, indeed!  The staff was welcoming and friendly, and the bartender/server, Sean, was the cherry on top to our entire visit! I wish all fine dining restaurants had someone as charming and knowledgeable to ensure the quality of a true fine-dining experience.   All in all, definitely a delicious meal comparable to that of restaurants in downtown Philadelphia, sans the drive into the city!  We will be back."}
{"text":"Food and decor is nice. My only complaint is the service, not that they were rude, just very slow. Essentially there was only 2 people working the entire bar area. This included the bar and the tables. Both the bartender and the server were very friendly. We were a party of 4 and drinks were very slow to come out. The bartender was covering the entire bar as well as making drinks for the tables.  In my opinion it would make sense to have another bartender at least for a couple hours when things are busy.  On to the table service. Again, very friendly but the server we had was covering all the tables and then told us she is also delivering room service orders.  We ordered drinks and apps to start. One of which was the Cheese Plate. After delivered no explanation of the types of cheeses. We also asked for water, and then had to ask again to get it.  We had another round of drinks and ordered dinner. No question to us if we wanted wine with dinner.  The location name is Wine Bar, but whatever.  3 of our 4 meals were brought out. I ordered the chicken and that was the dish that was \"delayed\" in coming out. The rest of our party was more than half done their meals when mine was finally brought out.  The server apologized. At no time did a manager stop at our table and offer their regards for the delay in receiving the food.  After dinner the server asked if we wanted desert, coffee, etc. She advised desert was on them. We really werent hungry for desert but ordered something and split it among the table.  Overall a nice place with friendly staff and nice decor. Poor service can ruin the nicest of places and not having enough help is causing problems here. Hopefully they add some support."}
{"text":"Great décor and the coolest bartender, Rocco!  The food is fantastic and un- pretentious!  The oasis in an area where there aren't many choices except chain restaurants, it offers a comfortable vibe and creative menu options.  I don't know how many times I have driven past this place in the 11 years I've lived in the area and not stopped until now.  Parking is easy and so is the access to 202 and 30.  My new favorite meeting spot to catch up with friends."}
{"text":"Located within Sheraton hotel on Lancaster ave. great food menu and tvs to catch sports and meet up w peeps!"}
{"text":"Great service at the bar with Rocco! We came in & didn't see the dining room host stand so we ended up eating in the bar. The food was great & even though it got REALLY busy when we walked in, Rocco handled everything with ease. Steak salad was very good & the chipotle ranch dressing quite tasty. My husband got the pork chop with hominy grits & LOVED it. We would definitely come back again!"}
{"text":"Dont bother.  New management going in different direction.  Now just a hotel restaurant like all the others."}
{"text":"I hate to rate them a one because they were going to get a four or five...however there was mold in the water at our table. Black fuzzy floating mold. The food tasted good until we saw that, which made us question the food. When we told the staff about the mold they took the water and brought a different jug. We don't know where it came from and we had some questions that were not answered. The people seemed cordial enough but I would not go back. Be careful. You might also get sick after going there."}
{"text":"About a month ago, I went here with some friends and was very, very pleased. It was a weeknight and it was not crowded at all, but it should be impossible to get a table because of how delicious the food is! The chef was offering a special menu when we were there, so both mine and my husband's meals were from that. I got the rib platter, which was OUTSTANDING. The ribs were perfectly done - tender and meaty - with awesome flavor. They were nicely slathered with a homemade peach BBQ sauce, but they weren't too wet. Really, everything you could want from a rib. It came with cowboy beans - an interesting, flavorful, & delicious mix of beans with tender little pieces of cactus mixed in. Also on the platter were braised mustard greens, which offset the sweetness of the ribs very nicely, and a giant hunk of buttery, wonderful cornbread.  My husband got the Brushpopper sandwich - a nice, thick piece of fried chicken breast with cream cheese, orange marmalade, and Serrano peppers on a roll. Sounds weird, right? Totally, insanely delicious. The chicken was breaded and fried just right and the cream cheese/marmalade/pepper combo was absolutely perfect. Awesome combo of sweet and spicy. Don't be afraid of it - you won't regret it, I promise. Dessert was a Philly soft pretzel chocolate bread pudding. What?!?! So. Good. There was a peanut butter sauce served with it and it was just the right amount of sweet to still let the pretzel shine through. All in all, I live about 45 minutes, without traffic, from The Whitehorse Tavern and I would drive there any time, no questions. Everything was delicious. Service was great. Nice wine selection. Highly recommend it."}
