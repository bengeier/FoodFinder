{"text":"Stayed at the Four Points by Sheraton hotel and went to the Ric's Lounge & Grill inside it for both dinner and breakfast.  Dinner: Our service was terrible. Took a while for someone to tell us we could seat ourselves, then we took a while to look through the menu and order, so by the time we ordered we were fairly hungry. A half-hour after we ordered, our waiter came up and said the kitchen had lost our order and asked us to repeat it for him, saying he would make sure we got a substantial discount. We weren't about to go somewhere else, so we repeated our orders and waited. About 20 minutes later, our waiter offered me another beer and said the food would be ready in \"2 seconds.\" We waited another 15 minutes or so and the food arrived. It was decent, but I might only think that because I was starving by this point, and the prices were about what I expected. It took forever to get the bill and forever for the waiter to bring a debit machine, so despite my 2 beers being comp'd I left an appropriately small tip.  Breakfast: We sat down and were first served by a waitress who took our drink orders and gave us menus. She said nothing about the buffet, which I only noticed hidden away after we had ordered our food. A waiter came by to take our orders, and was fairly prompt refilling my coffee. However, I was brought sausage instead of the bacon I asked for, which was odd. It again took forever to get the bill and pay.  Also, the restaurant's air conditioning is cranked up way too high. Several tables actually asked the waiters if anything could be done about it, and they said it was the hotel that controlled it, not them, so that made sitting in the restaurant pretty uncomfortable."}
{"text":"They started a contest for a $100 GC, never announced the winners. Went ahead and deleted the posts from their FB page. Shady ethics, I used to eat here consistently- never again."}
{"text":"I'll keep it short & sweet! Terrible service from the moment we walked in the door. Drinks took forever & the food even longer! Waiter didn't know what they had on tap! Got the orders wrong! Won't waist my time going back!"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch, waited FOREVER for service, the food, and the check! After waited for about 15min after the meal was finished, as no one came to ask if I would like to have the check, I walked around the restaurant and fetched the waiter.   I clocked 70 min I had spent for lunch, of which 55 min were spent on waiting. Food quality was not bad at all (bravo for the chef), but they really need to improve on their service. 'Nuff said."}
{"text":"My expectation of Rics Grill is that of an upscale casual franchise steakhouse and at first glance, that's the feeling it conveys by the large wine bottle glass display at the entrance, the funky bar set up and comfortable trendy seating throughout the dining room.   And that's about it hehehe.  When it comes to service and the meals, that's a whole different story.  Take an elegant place and add Denny's greasy spoon service and you get this Rics Grill.  Our party of 7 endured a dinner that stretched the span of over three hours.  The highlight of the evening was the red lentil and beef soup which was excellent and came very fast; had I known, I would have grabbed a bowl to go and avoided this sad experience! ... read on lol.  After the good start from the soup, things went downhill from there.  Next some appetizer of stuffed mushrooms came to the table which were ok and about an hour and fifteen minutes (yes that's over an hour later); the steaks.     I had the 10oz New York striploin which was terrible, tough and fatty, appeared panfried and not flame grilled with the broiler marks.  What kind of a steakhouse panfries its steaks; yuck!!!!   I had ordered no starch and steamed vegetables for my sides.  Well, the vegetables looked great and farm-to-table as advertised BUT, yes, unfortunately there is a BUT- the veggies were swimming in butter; I mean there was so much butter lathered on those poor veggies that the carrots alone could do laps in that fat pool!!! Not to mention the rest of the party got their meals spaced out so we each finished at various times; had they waited for everyone to get their plate; everything would've been cold and worsened the aggravation!  Desserts were so-so. We had given up by then on loitering any longer and wanted to leave ASAP.   So, we spent all this time in there, only to remember how carrots do laps in a pool of butter accompanied with trailer park service.  Would we return or recommend Rics again? \"No, thank you.\""}
{"text":"We stayed at the hotel on Business...went down for happy hour. Drink prices from 2-5p are wonderful.Not American Happy Hour prices, but for Canada...a great deal. The food is delish!!!..we shared the Salt n Pepper Wings, Ginger Chili Chicken and the Crispy Calamari. The Calamari is the best..but the other 2 'tizers were also excellent....and at $7.00 each, a steal. The service is hit-and miss..more miss than hit...but the food and drink prices are spot-on"}
{"text":"Fantastic food! The menu has a good variety for a steakhouse. It's a nice smaller restaurant connected to the Four Points hotel.  They offer Sterling Silver beef which is the best quality available."}
{"text":"I cannot tell you how much I love staying at the Four Point Sheraton Airport because the staff at Ric's Lounge \"ALWAYS\" are outstanding with their service. A shout out to Amanda, each time we have stayed you not only looked after us but the service was ABOVE AND BEYOND exceptional! My visits to deal with my brothers estate was not the happiest times for me but you always took extra care and even tried to put a smile on my face. Again, GREAT work to the whole team......Well done!"}
{"text":"I'm not even sure if this deserves a 3 star, but the food was decent.   We got there just before 12 on Friday, the lounge part had no one in there, and looked a little busy on the other side. There was only two people working, one chick who was playing bartender and looked like she literally came across from COP and another lady who was dressed properly.   It took forever to get drinks, and bartender had no idea what was in the drinks, then asked if we wanted menus, as if we did it would be a wait, that they were all being used on the other side.   Finally got the menus and our food ordered, the food came out surprisingly fast considering everything else. We had the stuffed mushrooms to share, which were pretty tasty and I went the spinach, strawberry and goat cheese salad with chicken. Which was good, but it's pretty basic salad. Steph had the lettuce wraps, which were given with terrible lettuce to even make a wrap.   Being that it's close to my house, I could see going for a drink here, but I'd make sure I have plenty of time to kill."}
{"text":"a very good dinning experience. I came with my family on a Friday ight & all enjoyed the food (excellent) and service (very good)."}
{"text":"So I'm staying at the Four Point's Sheraton and this place happened to be part of the hotel. I walk to the front and there is this poster that talks about how this new hot shot chef has taken over, Eric Steele I believe. Later a coworker of mine even said that the chef and the place was in the paper so I guess he was more legit than I initially thought.   I've been eating here for a couple of days now, and I have tried a number of dishes. The spicy italian pizza, great. The cacciatore pasta? Great. The smoked brisket sandwich? I want to say great but the bread was slightly stale so I was sort of disappointed, especially after all the other great meals that I was provided with.  My favorite thing though, was the poutine. Perhaps I am American and I don't know good authentic poutine when I see one, but this sure was good. I'm going to have to take a line from Joey from the show \"Friends\" during the episode where Rachel made a meat pie. Fries? Good. Gravy? Goooood. Whole melted cheese curds? Goooood. Green onions? Goooooood. Bacon??? GOOOOOOOOOD! All of these things combined for an awesomely tasty dish. Ask for extra gravy on the side, makes it way better...although I was slightly upset they charged me 2 bucks for gravy, I mean the poutine was already like $10.   That leads me to the reason why I give the place 4 stars instead of 5, despite how good the food is, the place is bank. Like seriously, don't expect to walk out without spending at least $18, and that's if you're LOOKING for the cheap items. But it's nice to know that not all restaurants part of a hotel are shitty. Thanks Ric's Lounge for changing that stereotype for me...but please please lower the prices a bit so the average schmoe can afford it."}
{"text":"We were here for a group of friends for dinner on a weeknight.  Our service was okay but not exceptional.  The waitress disappears for 10 minutes at a time, sometimes longer.  As a result our drinks were empty a few times during the course of the night.    The food also came very slowly... it may have to do with the fact that we had a group of about 10 people.  The main entrees probably came 45 minutes after our food order.  On a night that they are not that busy, it is a bit long.  The food, when it actually came, was not bad.  The rib eye steak that I had was well prepared and cooked to the medium rare as ordered.  My wife's duck dish was a bit overdone however... probably due to the fact it was on a heating plate for a while.  Overall, it is not a bad place to spend a night if you are not in a hurry, because you'll literally spend most of the night there."}
{"text":"This place gets 4-stars because the food is consistent and good. Service is inconsistent. I think it's because sometimes it's really busy at happy hour or not and the amount of staff is the same so you may have one person running around serving one table or 8. Food-wise, I've never had anything I didn't like. There's been Groupons for this place lately but with the economy and a rival hotel chain putting up a hotel right in front of them and blocking them from view, they've had to try some things to let people know they are there. Ric's is located in the 4 Points Sheraton, off Barlow and Sunridge Way. The most recent visit I had a steak sandwich and you  know from your first bite that it's from VERY good meat. It was cooked to perfection and tender as can be. Right now they have a special lunch menu, there are 10 items and each is only $10. There is something for everyone on it. This is my go to place if I need to meet friends and want to be close to work. I like it for lunch and business meetings because it is relatively quiet compared to places like Earl's or Joey Barlow and so conversation is not a shouting match. There is underground parking as well as parking infront and along the side of the entrance."}
{"text":"I am skeptical of Hotel Restaurants but this one surprised me totally  Milestones  earls  the keg is what this is based on  Ric's takes the cake in food quality  Hot looking Servers.    Check  Great food.   Check  Reasonable Prices. Check   I had the alaskan Cod Tacones which is a delicious deep fried cod fish taco  The chefs salad was a cobb variation  very fresh and crisp  Tomato basil soup actually had the essence of basil that many used canned soups lacked  Hotel Cooking at its best. Listen up Marriott the Starwood group is taking away your dinner business  I never ever ever eat at a Marriott for dinner as having worked ata a Ramada Hotel it the kitchen i know the food is pretty much frozen food reheated."}
{"text":"So quick and short.  Average food, decent setting and service.  Reasonably what you would expect from a hotel based resturant.   In short, ok if you're staying there, probably would not go to otherwise"}
{"text":"Visiting Calgary and was happy to find this place close to our hotel, as the Ric's in Cranbrook was typically quite good. Tried dinner on our second night in, and was disappointed both in the wait time (10 minutes for our first beverage and over 90 minutes for our food to show after ordering ) and the quality of the food (steaks severely over done). We actually came back for drinks two nights later, hoping that we had just experienced an off night, only to find the service to be even worse, even though the lounge was even quieter than the previous visit. You guys can definitely do much better, but unfortunately our experience will lead us to go elsewhere until things improve."}
{"text":"Located in a business-focussed airport hotel, Ric's is much better than it needs to be.  Great breakfast buffet, very nice dinner menu and a wide choice of beer choices.  All in all, a good place."}
{"text":"Thought I would give this Ric's another try after being emailed by the Manager when I gave it a bad review.  And I'm happy to say that my meal was top notch. I had a New York and it was a perfect medium.  It was a little pricey but worth it."}
{"text":"Was there for a Saturday evening meal.  The Good - Food was quite tasty except for the pizza, and good portion. The Bad -   The pizza I ordered was overcooked and came with very dark crust, borderline burnt maybe. Prices are too high, but maybe that's what you can expect for a Resturaunt attached to a hotel. The Ugly - Service was poor. Sat with an empty glass for a long time. Food came out very slow. Also took forever to settle the bill. Likelyhood of returning: unlikely."}
{"text":"Ordered a bowl of clam chowder ($8) and a side of hot wings. ($14)  Small portion size of soup, no flavour.  With the soup came 2 packages of saltine crackers, pretty truck stop diner ish.   Wings ($14) were greasy, very little flavour.   Service was mediocre.   For the small portion size and flavourless food it was very expensive and not worth it.   When we asked the server about small size of bowl he said it's a common complaint."}
{"text":"The medium rare Filet Mignon Steak was just perfect!! Juicy, flavourful cooked to perfection... Excellent!!  The place has a nice ambiance. The servers are lively, good service with a smile. From a hotel like Sheraton, this lounge is just what should be expected."}
{"text":"I had no idea this place existed until Missy D. suggested it to have an impromptu birthday lunch. Close to both of us, it worked, so we headed over ready to gorge on some food and champagne (well....at least I was). We sat ourselves in the lounge, which looked pretty dead, but were informed right away by a server that it was going to be a while, as they were swamped in the dining room and there were only 2 of them working. I glanced behind her and noticed a whole dining room on the other side! Interesting. She asked if we wanted menus, and we said we did. We were told they were all being used by the dining room, do we know what we want? Um...we would have to see a menu to tell you that. Derr.  So we finally order our drinks from the bartender (who was TOO casually dressed in my opinion - Uggs and a sweatshirt aren't really appropriate when you're serving at a restaurant, let alone behind the bar. Or is it just me?). The drink menu was expansive, and when we listed our choices off, she gave us a weird look and said \"ohhkaay...it's gonna take a while\". Errr...? We just looked at each other mildly confused. Surprisingly, she managed to figure it out and our food came out shortly after. Everything was really good, and the manager even came around to talk to everyone in the lounge. I ordered the lettuce wraps and I let him know that the lettuce pieces weren't really adequate to \"wrap\" anything in (think more along the lines of salad pieces). He was very helpful and friendly. The service wasn't great, but I'd probably return because it's close and the food was good."}
{"text":"Failure in everyway. Table of 10 in an empty restaurant, saw server after 10 minutes for drinks, those were screwed up. Food took 40 minutes, all came out after sitting under heat lamp. Had to ask where food was, server was so indifferent. I have literally never had worse service. Took us an hour and forty five minutes to get food and eat. Still had auto grat on bill. Never go here!"}
{"text":"I took my family here for my mom's bday/Mother's day.  They have a wide range of wine here so perfect for all you wine lovers.   The ambiance was casual, although dressing up would be suited too.   We ordered crab cakes as an appetizer but it didn't quite make the mark.   I like it crispy but the texture was a little too mushy. Usually, I enjoy the appetizers the most so I was disappointed when it wasn't up to par.  Luckily, the main course made up for it.  We had filet mignon ( can't go wrong with that) and I made my brother ordered the shrimp and scallops pasta.  There's not a lot of cream pasta's out there that have just the right amount of seasoning.  This pasta bowl has indeed met my expectations.  The cream wasn't too rich and the flavor was enough for you to want more.   Our waitress was very tentative and paid attention to all of us.  She even took my nephew around while she was serving so we could have peace and quiet and finish our meals.  If you have a cute, baby and need someone to babysit, come to her...hehe  The service and food here are exceptional but I was stuck with a hefty bill.  This place would be great for special occasions or for guys out there that want to take girls on a date."}
{"text":"Solid 3.5 stars. One star experience at breakfast and five stars for dinner. Never go here for breakfast, I warned you. If you order a la carte they take from their buffet and feed it to you.  Dinner is excellent though, service is great and the food is delicious. Came here three nights in a row, there's a great variety of foods and it's pretty good!  Favourite dishes: their poutine, pizzas, and desserts. Comfort foods.  More \"meh\" dishes: steaks, tuna dishes, anything more sophisticated than good ol' canadian/american food.  Prices are decent and portions are reasonable as well.   They are inside the Four Points hotel off the highway, overall a great meal. The ambiance is cozy and nice, large dining room and full bar."}
{"text":"I love Ric's Grill off of 17th avenue, however this one wasn't able to compare. The atmosphere was a little off and although it was beautiful inside, the lights were completely on....for dinner. That's a little weird? Definitely can't cozy up there! I did have to remind myself several times that it is attached to a hotel, so it made a little more sense to me. My food was okay. Not quite as good as I've experienced before at the downtown location. My steak sandwich was only luke-warm at best. Sorry Ric's. Try again!"}
{"text":"Was picking up an order here and they completely botched it, missed half the order.  The staff seemed a bit frazzled when I came in saying I was picking up an order, like it has never ever happened before.  I even asked them before I left if that was all, they said 'yes' after a bit of hesitation though (that red flag should have made me check).  They were able to fix it but still, it was quite annoying."}
{"text":"Worst food and worst service!!! There was no host  to great us. The bartender pointed to a table we could occupy. The waitress was uninformed. I cancelled my appetizer but they still brought it to my table. I asked them to change my order and they charged me for the food that I didn't even eat!!! The manager didn't even come to our table to apologize, he/she just kept sending different members of his/her staff; whom told us they will replace our original order; and guess what, they didn't bring our food \"because\" I told the waitress to cancel my appetizer. How this restaurant functions is beyond me.   Terrible experience! Never coming back her again! Who is the manager of this place?!?!  Horrifying experience!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Had dinner with my friend here it's a nice resto bar inside the hotel we are staying at but the food was not so great I got there house burger and my friend got the rib we spit it so we can both try each other's burgers and for what I paid I expected way better it was 14.75 $ Wendy does a better job at least the wateriest was nice they also had a good house beer that's what saved them abit maybe just stay away from their burgers"}
