{"text":"I ordered the Mamma Mia hoagie. It was probably the worst hoagie I ever had. The bread was so dry I wouldn't feed it to birds. For $10.95 I expected a way better hoagie than that. My wife had a pizza, it was very average. We will not be return customers."}
{"text":"We went out to see Daughtry in concert. The Italian kitchen had great pizzas. I would recommend hitting this place. Great prices!!!!!"}
{"text":"Get a pizza, they looked ok.  I ordered the linguine carbonara.  I should have read the menu more closely, what I got didn't even resemble carbonara, except it had pasta, bacon and cheese.  My carbonara appeared to actually be limp linguine, with four pieces of non descript cheese, swimming in canned Alfredo sauce, with diced onion,ham and bacon thrown in.  Recommend to Concerto to Google \"carbonara\"--guanciale, Romano, parmigiana, egg.  I like mine with bucatini.  Either that, or rename your alla carbonara as Alfredo with ham, onions, and bacon."}
{"text":"Great food and fast, especially if you're attending a comedy show, concert or other performance at the Hard Rock Rocksino. Try the Rock Star pizza!  They also have beer and wine."}
{"text":"Concerto Italian Kitchen is inside the Hard Rock Rocksino in Northfield, Ohio. It features a relatively short menu of pizzas and pastas, and wine. Prices are reasonable for a casino restaurant; ingredients and toppings are on display in the open kitchen. Although the other restaurants were packed, we were able to order and sit down within 15 minutes. The carnivore cavatappi was tasty, a variety of italian meats and cheese and al dente pasta. Not fine dining, to be sure but well-executed and tasty. The chicken caesar was equally good, authentic caesar dressing and abundant shaved parmesan. With two glasses of wine and a tip, the total came to about $45. This is a good spot for a casual dinner before a concert or if you're paying the slots...or the ponies since its right next to the track."}
{"text":"By FAR the worst pizza I've ever tasted! I ordered the margherita pizza with \"fresh mozzarella\" and received a hard disk with what tasted like condensed tomato soup for sauce and nickel sized dollops of hard cheese. I LITERALLY would have preferred the cheapest frozen pizza sold in grocery stores."}
{"text":"Ordered pasta build your own , very dry no sauce , order took forever and when I got it it was already cold !  Edible but definitely not very good! They act like they just opened last week.  Very unorganized!"}
{"text":"My husband and I popped in here for \"linner\" today. Our first time trying the place. I was leery due to some of the poor reviews, but I had a coupon to use so I figured...\"what the Hell? Let's give it a go!\" I kind of knew what to expect since I've seen it while donating my money to the Rocksino in the past. Concerto is described as \"Fast Casual Italian\" and that's exactly what it is. If you're going for fine dining this isn't what you'll find. And that's OK! You go up and place your order...all the pizza/pasta toppings are on display, then when you pay they give you a number to take to your table where they bring your food to you when it's ready. The menu seems limited at first glance, as they just do pizza, pasta, salads & hoagies. (And desserts and beverages!) However, they offer an extensive choice of toppings, and you can build your own pizza or pasta dish if you so choose! The service was fantastic!  Every staff member I had contact with was incredibly helpful and friendly. They were really welcoming!  Let's get to the food!!! I opted for the March Lunch Special Pizza.. the \"Mama Mia\". This is a thin crust pizza topped with Salami, Pepperoni, Ham, Capicola, Provolone, Tomatoes, Onions & a Garlic Vinaigrette. Holy Cow this pizza rocked!  And a price tag of only $9.95 made it even more delicious!  This was a nice-sized 12\" Pizza and I ended up taking 3 pieces home for later!  My husband went with the \"Little Italy\" Pasta with Linguine. (You're offered a choice of linguine or cavatappi.) His dish came loaded with tomato sauce, shredded Provolone, Italian Sausage, Capicola, Olives & Parmesan. And when I say loaded I mean loaded!  He said there was as much meat as there was pasta!!! I tried a bite and it was very tasty! His dish came with a garlic bread stick which he said was soft and garlicky. We each got a glass of Cabernet for $7.00/glass. I have to add they gave generous pours!   The place was clean, the service exemplary, and the food delicious. They're doing their thing quite well and I'll most definitely return!"}
